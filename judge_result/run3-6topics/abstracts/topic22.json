        "Doc_abstract":"Although refractory to chemotherapy, metastatic melanoma may respond to adoptive immunotherapy. As novel treatments evolve, surgeons may be asked to perform metastasectomy not only for palliation or potential cure but also for isolation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. This study was undertaken to examine outcomes of patients with melanoma undergoing thoracic metastasectomy in preparation for investigational immunotherapy.;A retrospective review identified 107 consecutive patients who underwent 116 thoracic metastasectomy procedures from April 1998 to July 2009. Indications for surgical intervention included procurement of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, rendering of patients to no evaluable disease status, palliation, and diagnosis. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria were used to assess tumor response.;Thoracotomy, lobectomy, and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with nonanatomic resection were the most common procedures. Major complications included 1 death and 1 coagulopathy-induced hemothorax. Seventeen patients were rendered to no evaluable disease status. Virtually all patients with residual disease had tumor specimens cultured for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes; approximately 70% of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cultures exhibited antitumor reactivity. Of the 91 patients with residual or recurrent disease, 24 (26%) underwent adoptive cell transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, of whom 7 exhibited objective responses (29% response rate and 8% based on intent to treat). Rapid disease progression precluded tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy in most cases. Actuarial 1- and 5-year survival rates for patients rendered to no evaluable disease status or receiving or not receiving tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were 93% and 76%, 64% and 33%, and 43% and 0%, respectively.;Relatively few patients currently having thoracic metastasectomy undergo adoptive cell transfer. Continued refinement of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte expansion protocols and improved patient selection might increase the number of patients with melanoma benefiting from these interventions.",

In an attempt to delineate the histologic diagnostic criteria, to classify different categories of lymphocytic infiltrates, previously described by Elder et al. at brisk, nonbrisk, and absent, and to verify their prognostic significance, we reviewed 285 consecutive cases of primary cutaneous melanomas (American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage I and II).;In addition to clinical variables (age, sex, and location of tumor) and the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in the vertical growth phase, the histopathologic attributes reviewed included mitotic rate, thickness, and regression. The results were derived from independent histopathologic review by two pathologists (C.G.C., M.C.M., Jr.) on separate occasions. A multivariate analysis of survival was performed with the Cox's regression model.;The 5- and 10-year rates for melanoma with a vertical growth phase and a brisk infiltrate were 77% and 55%, respectively. For tumors with a nonbrisk infiltrate, the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 53% and 45%, respectively, and for tumors with absent tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 37% and 27%, respectively. Mitotic index, thickness, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were statistically (univariate analysis) significant prognostic factors (P = 0.003, 0.000001, 0.0003, respectively), whereas the presence or absence of regression is not. In the univariate statistical analysis, the sex of patients and site of melanoma also were statistically significant (P = 0.00001 and 0.002 respectively), whereas age (P = 0.98) was not statistically significant. The multivariate analysis of thickness, mitotic rate, and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes showed that thickness and presence tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were significant and independent histologic prognostic factors. With regard to the clinical factors, sex retained its independent prognostic significance. The histologic characteristics of melanoma with vertical growth phase (brisk, nonbrisk, and absent) are exemplified.;We demonstrated that when categories of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are strictly defined, they indeed have very strong predictive value for primary cutaneous melanomas with a vertical growth phase. This work confirms the work of Clark et al. and fully illustrates the brisk, nonbrisk, and absent categories of infiltration. Finally, a multivariate analysis comparing thickness, mitotic rate and presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes showed that only thickness and presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are significant and independent positive histologic prognostic factors.",

Marked intratumoral heterogeneity of NY-ESO-1 protein expression was observed. NY-ESO-1 expression was associated with increased primary tumor thickness (P = 0.007) and inversely correlated with superficial spreading melanoma (P < 0.02). NY-ESO-1 expression was also associated with reduced numbers and density of CD3+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (P = 0.017). When NY-ESO-1 protein was expressed, CD3+ T cells were less diffusely infiltrating the tumor and were more often arranged in small clusters (P = 0.010) or as isolated cells (P = 0.002) than in large clusters of more than five lymphocytes. No correlation of NY-ESO-1 expression with gender, age, tumor site, ulceration, lymph node sentinel status, or survival was observed.

We have characterized the expression of the C-type lectin natural killer receptor CD94/NKG2 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in primary and metastatic melanoma lesions. By immunohistochemistry, 5-10% of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, both in primary and metastatic lesions, expressed CD94. More than 95% of these CD94+ cells coexpressed CD8 and the percentage of CD94 expression within the CD8+ cell population ranged from 5 to 20% with a higher expression in metastatic lesions. CD94/NKG2 exists both in an inhibitory and an activating form; thus, it was necessary to determine whether the inhibitory CD94/NKG2-A/B, the activating CD94/NKG2-C/E, or both were expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using specific primers for NKG2-A/B and C/E mRNA revealed the presence of NKG2-C/E in all primary and metastatic lesions. In contrast, the inhibitory NKG2-A/B was only present in 50% of primary tumors whereas 80% of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in metastatic lesions expressed these transcripts. In healthy humans, the mean number of inhibitory natural killer receptors is higher than that of activating receptors, but the opposite was true for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in melanoma. The reversal of the ratio of inhibitory to activating natural killer receptors among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes suggests a regulated event due to either specific factors within the tumor microenvironment, preferential homing of T cell subsets, or certain stages of T cell activation.",

Seventeen melanoma cell lines and 11 nonmelanoma cell lines were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus containing the HLA-A2.1 gene. Infection by the vaccinia virus resulted in expression of functional HLA-A2 molecules on the cell surface of virtually 100% of infected cells within a 3.5-h period. The results showed that 11 of 17 (65%) naturally HLA-A2- melanoma cell lines were specifically lysed by the HLA-A2-restricted, melanoma-specific TIL after infection with the vaccinia-HLA-A2.1 virus. None of the nine human nonmelanoma cell lines tested (three colon cancer, four breast cancer, or two immortalized non-tumor cell lines) or two murine melanoma cell lines were lysed by the HLA-A2-restricted TIL after vaccinia-HLA-A2.1 infection. Coinfection of the vaccinia virus containing the beta 2-microglobulin gene with the vaccinia-HLA-A2.1 virus increased the surface expression of HLA-A2 and subsequent lysis by melanoma-specific tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. With this new method we could extend previous findings demonstrating that shared melanoma Ag recognized by HLA-A2-restricted tumor infiltrating lymphocytes exist among melanoma cells from different patients regardless of HLA type. These Ag represent excellent candidates for the development of vaccines to induce T cell responses for the immunotherapy of patients with melanoma.",

We examined the association of MMP-23 with the anti-tumor immune response - as assessed by the prevalence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. Further, we examined the association between MMP-23 expression and response to immunotherapy. Considering also an in trans mechanism, we examined the association of melanoma MMP-23 and melanoma Kv1.3 expression.;Our data revealed an inverse association between primary melanoma MMP-23 expression and the anti-tumor T cell response, as demonstrated by decreased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) (P = 0.05), in particular brisk TILs (P = 0.04), and a trend towards an increased proportion of immunosuppressive Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (P = 0.07). High melanoma MMP-23 expression is also associated with recurrence in patients treated with immune biologics (P = 0.037) but not in those treated with vaccines (P = 0.64). Further, high melanoma MMP-23 expression is associated with shorter periods of progression-free survival for patients receiving immune biologics (P = 0.025). On the other hand, there is no relationship between melanoma MMP-23 and melanoma Kv1.3 expression (P = 0.27).;Our data support a role for MMP-23 as a potential immunosuppressive target in melanoma, as well as a possible biomarker for informing melanoma immunotherapies.",

These in vitro activated T cells depend on the growth factor, interleukin (IL)-2, and may undergo apoptosis in vivo when they are transferred. The authors previously reported that the need for an exogenous source of IL-2 could be abrogated in vitro by retrovirally transducing antitumor T lymphocytes with an exogenous IL-2 gene. Here they report that this growth of IL-2 transductants depended on restimulation of the T-cell receptor complex and appeared to be regulated at the transcriptional level of the transduced IL-2 gene. The transduced IL-2 transcript was barely detectable in IL-2-transductants just before they died without restimulation, and they expressed a low level of the CD25 molecule, the alpha chain of the IL-2 trimeric receptor complex. Melanoma-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (either bulk or CD8+ cells alone), when transduced with an IL-2 retroviral vector, could produce IL-2 upon tumor stimulation and proliferated after the destruction of autologous tumor cells in the absence of added IL-2. Control vector-transduced tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes failed to do so under the same conditions. These findings provide a foundation for the development of clinical efforts to adoptively transfer melanoma-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes transduced with an IL-2 retroviral vector for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma to evaluate the fate and therapeutic effect of these IL-2 gene-modified antitumor T lymphocytes in vivo.",

The crucial role of the tumor microenvironment has recently been shown: melanoma cells render their immediate environment immunotolerant, undermining the effectiveness of stimulated cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The mechanisms responsible for this state of immune tolerance are a major focus of research. Current therapeutic strategies are based on early adjuvant approaches, destruction of regulatory T cells by lymphodepletion prior to immunotherapy, selection of the melanoma antigens inducing the best cytotoxic T cell responses, and combining cellular therapy with monoclonal antibodies that block molecules inhibiting T lymphocyte activation.

However, the impact of TIGIT on melanoma specific CTLs in the effector phase remains still unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that melanoma cells control anti-melanoma CTL responses via the TIGIT-CD155 interaction in the effector phase. TIGIT is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells, and CD155 is one of the cognate ligands expressed on the tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells. First, we confirmed that CD155 was constitutively expressed on melanoma cells. We then demonstrated that CD155 on melanoma cells suppressed cytokine release from melanoma-specific CTLs via interaction with TIGIT. Overexpression of CD155 enhanced, and its downregulation attenuated the suppressive effect. This suggested that anti-melanoma CTL responses are controlled not only by an imbalance in CD226 (an activating molecule binds to CD155) and TIGIT expression on T cells but also by the expression levels of CD155 on melanoma cells. In addition, co-blockade of TIGIT and PD-1 signals synergistically elicited a response of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) on autologous melanoma cells. These results suggest that the CD155-TIGIT interaction should be blocked for enhancement of anti-melanoma immune responses.Journal of Investigative Dermatology accepted article preview online, 12 October 2015. doi:10.1038/jid.2015.404.",

The clinical features associated with poor prognosis in patients with uveal melanoma include older age at presentation, male gender, larger tumor basal diameter and thickness, ciliary body location, diffuse tumor configuration, association with ocular/oculodermal melanocytosis, extraocular tumor extension, and advanced tumor staging by American Joint Committee on Cancer classification.

Since relationships have been observed between development of autoimmunity and responsiveness of melanoma to several types of immunotherapy, we tested whether polymorphisms of IRF5 are associated with responsiveness of melanoma to adoptive therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).;140 TILs were genotyped for four single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs10954213, rs11770589, rs6953165, rs2004640) and one insertion-deletion in the IRF5 gene by sequencing. Gene-expression profile of the TILs, 112 parental melanoma metastases (MM) and 9 cell lines derived from some metastases were assessed by Affymetrix Human Gene ST 1.0 array.;Lack of A allele in rs10954213 (G > A) was associated with non-response (p < 0.005). Other polymorphisms in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs10954213 demonstrated similar trends. Genes differentially expressed in vitro between cell lines carrying or not the A allele could be applied to the transcriptional profile of 112 melanoma metastases to predict their responsiveness to therapy, suggesting that IRF5 genotype may influence immune responsiveness by affecting the intrinsic biology of melanoma.;This study is the first to analyze associations between melanoma immune responsiveness and IRF5 polymorphism. The results support a common genetic basis which may underline the development of autoimmunity and melanoma immune responsiveness.",

To study this discrepancy, we analyzed CTL reactivity in a melanoma patient (F001) vaccinated with g209-2M peptide, a single residue variant of gp100(209-217). G209/g209-2M-reactive CTL were identified in post- but not prevaccination PBL. Limiting dilution analysis identified one predominant CTL clone (C1-35), with TCR Vbeta6s2, recognizing g209/HLA-A*0201-expressing targets. Additionally, two autologous melanoma lines (F001TU-3 and -4) and 20 separate tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cultures were generated from a fine needle aspirate of a metastatic lesion progressing after initial response to vaccination. Both F001TU did not express gp100 and were not recognized by C1-35. Loss of gp100 by F001TU correlated with a marked reduction of gp100 expression in the same metastatic lesion compared with prevaccination. Thus, ineffectiveness of C1-35 and tumor progression could be best explained by loss of target Ag expression. Interestingly, 12 of 20 tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cultures recognized F001TU, but none demonstrated g209/g209-2M reactivity, suggesting a functional dissociation between systemic and local immune response. This study suggests that vaccination effects must be analyzed in the target tissue, rather than in the systemic circulation alone.",

We carried out a 10-year cohort study on 4133 melanoma patients from the same geographic area (Lazio) with primary cutaneous melanoma diagnosed between January 1998 and December 2008. The probability of survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and prognostic factors were evaluated by multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards model). The 10-year survival rate for melanoma decreased with increasing Breslow thickness (Pfor trend<0.0001) and with age (Pfor trend<0.0001) whereas survival increased with increasing levels of TILs (Pfor trend=0.0001). The 10-year survival rate for melanoma divided into TILs intensity as scanty, moderate, and marked was 88.0, 92.2, and 97.0%, respectively. In the multivariate Cox model, the presence of high levels of TILs in primary invasive melanomas was associated with a lower risk of melanoma death (hazard ratio 0.32; 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.82) after controlling for sex, age, Breslow thickness, histological type, mitotic rate, and ulceration. After including lymph node status in the multivariate analysis, the protective effect of marked TILs on melanoma mortality remained (hazard ratio 0.37; 95% confidence interval 0.15-0.94).

Our analyses indicate that CD3+ T-cell receptor alpha/beta-expressing lymphocytes are the prevailing leukocyte subset in primary as well as secondary malignant melanoma. We further observed that in early lesions (< 0.75 mm) of superficial spreading melanoma the vast majority of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) belong to the CD4+ subset and frequently express CD45RA antigens. In more advanced tumors, the contribution of CD8+ TIL gradually increases, indicating that the quality of the anti-tumor immune response changes during the course of the disease. Finally, we found that a varying percentage of cutaneous TIL express the cutaneous leukocyte antigen which is defined by the monoclonal antibody HECA 452 and preferentially expressed by skin-seeking memory T cells.

Here we investigate the role of ADAR1 in melanoma immune resistance.Importantly, knockdown of ADAR1 in human melanoma cells induces resistance to tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in a cell contact-dependent mechanism. We show that ADAR1, in an editing-independent manner, regulates the biogenesis of miR-222 at the transcription level and thereby Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM1) expression, which consequently affects melanoma immune resistance. ADAR1 thus has a novel, pivotal, role in cancer immune resistance. Corroborating with these results, the expression of miR-222 in melanoma tissue specimens was significantly higher in patients who had no clinical benefit from treatment with ipilimumab as compared to patients that responded clinically, suggesting that miR-222 could function as a biomarker for the prediction of response to ipilimumab.These results provide not only novel insights on melanoma immune resistance, but also pave the way to the development of innovative personalized tools to enable optimal drug selection and treatment.

        "Doc_abstract":"Recognition of the melanoma Ag gp100 by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in vitro has been correlated with tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with the adoptive transfer of TIL plus IL-2. Three common gp100 epitopes have been identified that are recognized in the context of HLA-A2 by TIL from different patients: G9154 (KTWGQYWQV), G9209 (ITDQVPFSV), and G9280 (YLEPGPVTA). Upon stimulation with these peptides, melanoma-reactive CTL could be induced in vitro from PBL of some HLA-A2+ melanoma patients. However, numerous restimulations were required, and specific reactivity could not be generated in many patients. Therefore, to enhance the immunogenicity of gp100 peptides, amino acid substitutions were introduced into G9154, G9209, and G9280 at HLA-A*0201-binding anchor positions, but not at TCR contact residues, to increase peptide class I MHC-binding affinity. Several modified gp100 peptides bound with greater affinity to HLA-A*0201 than unmodified peptides and were recognized by TIL specific for the natural epitopes. These peptides were used to sensitize PBL from HLA-A2+ melanoma patients in vitro using peptide-pulsed autologous PBMC as stimulators. After five weekly restimulations with either the native G9209 or G9280 peptide, melanoma-reactive CTL could only be induced from two of seven patients. However, amino acid substitutions in these peptides enabled the induction of melanoma-reactive CTL from all seven patients. These results suggest that modified gp100 peptides may be more immunogenic than the native epitopes, and may be useful in immunotherapy protocols for patients with melanoma.",

A relative high frequency of anti-p939-specific effector cells appear to be present in situ in HLA-A2+ melanoma patients, since p939 is also recognized by freshly isolated tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. p939 represents a good candidate for the development of peptide-based immunotherapies for the treatment of patients with melanoma.",

We have developed two multivariate logistic regression models to predict survival in patients who have primary melanoma. The first of these models assigns patients to two groups based on radial or vertical growth phase. The probability of survival for those patients with vertical growth phase tumors was further determined based on a model using six variables (mitotic rate, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, tumor thickness, anatomic site of the primary tumor, sex, and histologic regression) that have the greatest strength as independent predictors of survival. This model is 89% accurate for predicting survival in patients with vertical growth phase tumors. A second model has been developed that uses readily available clinical parameters to predict survival. Four variables (tumor thickness, anatomic site, age, and sex) entered into the model as powerful independent predictors. Clinical algorithms for assessing patient risk are provided.",

To establish the characteristics of Fas ligand expression during the course of melanoma progression we performed a longitudinal study analyzing primary tumors as well as subsequently evolving metastases. In primary melanoma Fas ligand was expressed in two of 20 lesions; this expression was weak and restricted to few parts of the tumors. The Fas ligand positive primary melanomas were rather thick, i.e., 8.5 and 3.8 mm, versus a median of 2.4 mm of the remaining tumors. In contrast, for metastatic melanoma Fas ligand expression was present in six of 11 cases investigated. The metastases of primary tumors displaying Fas ligand maintained its expression. As Fas ligand positive melanoma cells are capable of inducing apoptosis in susceptible cells, e.g., Fas positive tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, we tested for the presence of apoptotic cells in situ by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. This analysis revealed that apoptotic cells were present within the Fas ligand positive tumors. The number of apoptotic cells, however, never exceeded 5% of the total cells.

Antibodies directed against gp100 are an important tool in the diagnosis of human melanoma. Since the gp100 antigen is highly expressed in melanocytic cells, we investigated whether this antigen might serve as a target for antimelanoma cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Here, we demonstrate that cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) derived from a melanoma patient (TIL 1200) are directed against gp100. HLA-A2.1+ melanoma cells are lysed by TIL from this patient. In addition, murine double transfectants, expressing both HLA-A2.1 and gp100, are lysed by TIL 1200, whereas transfectants expressing only HLA-A2.1 are not susceptible to lysis. Furthermore, the HLA-A2.1+ melanoma cell line BLM, which lacks gp100 expression and is resistant to lysis, becomes susceptible after transfection of gp100 cDNA. Finally, HLA-A2.1+ normal melanocytes are lysed by TIL 1200. These data demonstrate that the melanocyte differentiation antigen gp100 can be recognized in the context of HLA-A2.1 by CTL from a melanoma patient. Gp100 may therefore constitute a useful target for specific immunotherapy against melanoma, provided that no unacceptable cytotoxicity towards normal tissue is observed.",

We have crossed and characterized the Tyr::CreER(T2);PTEN(F-/-);BRAF(F-V600E/+) inducible melanoma model on a C57BL/6J background. Tumors from this model harbor the BRAF(V600E) mutation and are PTEN-deficient, making them highly suitable for the testing of targeted therapies. Furthermore, we crossed the model onto this specific background for use in immunotherapy studies, because most experiments in this field have been performed in C57BL/6J mice. Selective inhibition of BRAF(V600E) by PLX4720 treatment of melanoma-bearing mice resulted in a strong decrease of tumor outgrowth. Furthermore, the inducible melanomas had immune cell infiltrates similar to those found in human melanoma, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes could be cultured from these tumors. Our data indicate that the C57BL/6J Tyr::CreER(T2);PTEN(F-/-);BRAF(F-V600E/+) melanoma model could be used as a standard model in which targeted and immunotherapy combinations can be tested in a high-throughput manner.",

The action of interferon (IFN)-alpha, -beta, and -gamma has been extensively examined in melanoma and melanocyte cultures in vitro, and increasing information on the action of other cytokines is now available. All IFNs revealed a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect on melanoma cells with the highest growth inhibition caused by IFN-beta. Proliferation was also inhibited by interleukin (IL) 1-alpha and -beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. For IL-4, both growth-stimulatory and -inhibitory properties have been reported. Cellular differentiation in terms of melanin synthesis, formation of dendritelike structures, and antigenic changes was not affected by IFN-alpha or -beta. IFN-gamma, however, induced a more dedifferentiated and biologically more aggressive phenotype of melanoma cells. Histocompatibility antigen (HLA) class I molecules were found upregulated by all IFNs and by TNF-alpha, associated with a marked increase of melanoma cell lysis by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in vitro. HLA class II molecules were de novo expressed or enhanced by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. The adhesion molecules ICAM-1, LFA-3, and VLA-2 were upregulated by IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-1-beta, whereas melanoma-associated antigens were hardly affected by cytokines. It seems that both antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects may contribute to the antitumoral activity of cytokines in vivo. In vivo application of cytokines as well as combinations with cytotoxic drugs, therefore, may be promising for future treatment strategies.",

Successful engraftment of BNX mice with human hematopoietic stem cells has been demonstrated recently. We have investigated the potential use of BNX mice for studies relating to the biology and immunotherapy of human malignant melanoma. The intravenous injection of fresh single-cell suspensions of human malignant melanomas into mice resulted in widely disseminated disease. Metastatic spread of human melanoma in BNX mice mimicked that observed in patients: eg, there were numerous tumor nodules identified in the subcutaneous tissues as well as in a variety of visceral organs, including spleen, kidneys, thyroid, adrenals, lungs, heart, and brain. BNX mouse lymph nodes were replaced consistently by human malignant melanoma cells. The presence of human tumor cells in these mice was confirmed by histologic analysis and microcytofluorometry analyses using human melanoma-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Moreover, human melanoma cells passaged in BNX mice remained lysable in vitro by specifically cytolytic, autologous human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The capacity of fresh human malignant melanoma to disseminate widely in BNX mice may prove valuable not only for study of the biology of metastatic spread but also for studies of the immunotherapy of human melanoma using melanoma-specific MAbs and chemotherapeutic agents, as well as human TILs and LAK cells with or without retrovirus-mediated gene transfer modification.",

HPLC fractionation of this material revealed six T cell epitopes (termed P1-P6) recognized by HLA-A2-restricted, melanoma-specific tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) lines. Three of these fractions (P1, P2, and P4) appeared to represent shared/immunodominant melanoma Ag recognized in the context of HLA-A2 because they were expressed by 4/4 HLA-A2+ melanoma cell lines and were each recognized by all four oligoclonal HLA-A2-restricted TIL lines examined. Interestingly, P1 and P2 (but not P3-P6) could also be recognized by these same TIL when presented by the HLA-Aw69 class I molecule, which is closely related to HLA-A2. P3, P5, and P6 displayed more restricted expression and were differentially recognized by the four oligoclonal TIL lines. These results suggest that synthetic peptide derived from P1, P2, and P4 sequences (when deduced) may form the basis of effective prophylactic or therapeutic melanoma vaccines by stimulating CD8+ CTL in HLA-A2+ individuals.

However, the impact of TIGIT on melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the effector phase remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that melanoma cells control antimelanoma cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses via the TIGIT-CD155 interaction in the effector phase. TIGIT is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells, and CD155 is one of the cognate ligands expressed on the tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells. First, we confirmed that CD155 was constitutively expressed on melanoma cells. We then demonstrated that CD155 on melanoma cells suppressed cytokine release from melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes via interaction with TIGIT. Overexpression of CD155 enhanced and its downregulation attenuated the suppressive effect. This suggested that antimelanoma cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses are controlled not only by an imbalance in CD226 (an activating molecule that binds to CD155) and TIGIT expression on T cells but also by the expression levels of CD155 on melanoma cells. In addition, the co-blockade of TIGIT and PD-1 signals synergistically elicited a response of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes on autologous melanoma cells. These results suggest that the CD155-TIGIT interaction should be blocked for enhancement of antimelanoma immune responses.",

Use of biological response modifiers, such as interleukins and interferons, have been found to enhance therapeutic benefits to patients with malignant melanoma. Initial studies with a high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy have proved effective in patients with melanoma tumor, although a variety of systemic toxicities were observed. A low-dose IL-2 continuous infusion has shown a similar response in patients with melanoma tumor, but produced lesser toxicity. The low-dose IL-2 therapy has been studied with an adoptive transfer combined with either autologous lymphokine activated killer cells or autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). IL-2 in combination with chemotherapeutic agents such as flavone acetic acid, dacarbazine, and cyclophosphamide have also been studied in patients with metastatic melanoma. Results have shown a moderate response in patients with metastatic melanoma. TIL therapy, however, has been shown to result in higher objective regression due to potent tumor-specific killing and tumor-specific targeting characters of the TIL. The tumor targeting nature of the TIL creates the possibility of using TIL as a vehicle to deliver gene product specifically to tumor tissue. Safety and toxicity of gene-transduced TIL were addressed by the use of neomycin-resistant, gene-transduced TIL in patients with metastatic melanoma.

In addition, these CTLs recognized the T2 cell line pulsed exogenously with the peptide MART-1(27-35), which is the nine-amino acid immunodominant epitope of the MART-1 Ag recognized on melanoma tumor cells by nearly all HLA-A2-restricted TIL. Thus, we have demonstrated the ability to generate tumor-specific CTLs from PBLs that are similar in their reactivity to TIL. This technique obviates the need for autologous tumor tissue and suggests that PBLs contain sufficient CTL precursors for use in generating antitumor CTLs for cellular immunotherapy trials.",

The TCR variable (V) genes, joining (J) segments, and N diversity regions used by five clonal lines and one highly oligoclonal, melanoma-specific, CD8+ TIL line were examined utilizing PCR amplification with V gene subfamily-specific primers and anchor PCR.

Antibody inhibition studies showed that two of these TIL clones were restricted by an HLA-A2 molecule which was identified as A2.1 by gene sequencing. The third CTL clone was not restricted by HLA-A2, but by a B or C HLA antigen. HLA-A2-restricted CTL clones M17-1 and M17-2 lysed 5 and 12 out of 15 HLA-A2+ allogeneic melanomas, respectively. Since they did not lyse autologous Epstein-Barr virus B cells, HLA-A2.1-transfected P815 cells, 13 HLA-A2+ non-melanoma tumor cell lines and 10 HLA-A2- melanomas, these clones appeared specific for melanoma-restricted epitopes presented by the HLA-A2.1 molecule. We then tried to determine why a few HLA-A2+ melanomas were refractory to TIL lysis. By using a combination of flow cytometry analysis, partial cloning and sequencing of their HLA-A2 genes, we show that failure to lyse did not result from low expression or polymorphism of the HLA-A2 molecule, or from deficient expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and LFA-3 by these melanomas. Taken together, our data confirm at the clonal level the existence of shared melanoma antigens recognized by TIL in the HLA-A2.1 context. They further show that individual peptides derived from these antigens are expressed by a large majority of HLA-A2+ melanomas.

Among nine nevi, few LCA+ TIL were found, among which rare cells were positive for TIA-1 (mean, 2.0). Five nontumorigenic radial growth phase melanomas also had few total TIL and rare TIA-1+ TIL (mean, 3.4); the nontumorigenic radial growth phase component of seven tumorigenic vertical growth phase melanomas had higher numbers of TIA-1+ TIL (mean, 11). Twelve cases of tumorigenic vertical growth phase melanoma showed a variable but significantly greater number of both LCA+ TIL and TIA-1+ TIL (mean, 30.6). Nine cases of metastatic melanoma had a wide range of variation in LCA as well as in TIA-1+ TIL (mean, 46). Although the mean total number of TIA-1+ TIL increased from nontumorigenic radial growth phase to tumorigenic vertical growth phase to metastases, TIA-1+ as a percentage of TIL declined across these categories of tumor progression (42%, 31%, and 26%, respectively). Our results show that these attributes of TIA-1+ TIL, both increasing total number but decreasing percentage, appear to be a marker of tumor progression of malignant melanomas.

Lymphocyte migration from blood into peripheral tissues is mainly regulated by vascular endothelium. However, the blood vessels and mechanisms governing the recruitment of TILs in melanoma tumors remain poorly understood. Here, we show that high endothelial venules (HEVs), specialized blood vessels for lymphocyte extravasation into lymphoid tissues, are frequently found in melanoma tumors and are associated with high levels of lymphocyte infiltration. The analysis of 225 primary melanomas revealed that lymphocytes specifically infiltrated HEV-rich areas of melanoma tumors and that the density of MECA-79+ HEVs was variable among patients and strongly correlated with CD3+, CD8+ and CD20+ TIL densities. Inflammatory (CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11) and lymphoid (CCL21, CCL19 and CXCL13) chemokines as well as TH1 and naïve T-cell genes were overexpressed in melanoma samples with high densities of tumor HEVs. Mature dendritic cells (mDCs) were frequently found around tumor HEVs and densities of HEVs and DC-LAMP+ mDCs within tumor stroma were strongly correlated. DCs which maintain HEVs in lymph nodes, may thus also contribute to the regulation of HEVs in melanomas. Finally, we found significantly higher densities of tumor HEVs in melanomas with tumor regression, low Clark level of invasion and thin Breslow thickness (all p < 0.001). The strong association between tumor HEVs, TILs, mDCs and clinical parameters of melanoma, supports a critical role for HEVs in limiting malignant melanoma development through both naïve and effector T-lymphocyte recruitment and activation.",

Here we analyzed the responses to synthetic peptides of HLA-A2.1-restricted CTL clones specific for melanoma antigens MART-1 and NA17-A. We showed that peptide concentrations ranging from 1 pM to 10 nM efficiently sensitized the peptide transporter-deficient T2 cells to lysis. T2 cells pulsed with melanoma peptides also induced TIL proliferation and detectable secretion of IL-2, IFN-gamma and GM-CSF, but only for peptide concentrations 10- to 10,000-fold higher than those required for lysis. Hence this suggests that partial triggering of TIL clones by melanoma cells could be due to expression of appropriate MHC-peptide complexes at subthreshold levels. In support of this, we showed that melanoma cells, unable to trigger IL-2 secretion, developed this ability when incubated with the appropriate peptide.

These CTL lines specifically lysed and release cytokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and GM-CSF) in response to T2 cells pulsed with MART-1(27-35), as well as to HLA-A2+ MART-1+ melanoma cells. CTL generated with MART-1(27-35) also lysed uncultured HLA-A2+ melanoma cells derived from tumor biopsies, indicating that this MART-1 epitope is likely to be expressed in association with HLA-A2 on the surface of tumor cells in vivo. CTL lines generated with MART-1(27-35) mediated 25- to 100-fold higher lytic activity than MART-1-reactive CTL grown from TIL in the presence of high dose IL-2. These results demonstrate that MART-1(27-35) peptide may represent an ideal candidate for Ag-specific immunotherapy in melanoma patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has emerged over the past 2 decades as a rational approach for staging regional lymph nodes in patients with clinically node-negative melanoma (stage I and II disease). Large multi-institutional studies have confirmed that when performed by experienced surgeons, it is an accurate, reliable technique for identifying occult regional nodal disease, and that SLN status is the most important prognostic factor in patients with stage I and II melanoma. However, the incidence of occult regional nodal metastasis in patients with thin melanoma (<or= 1.0 mm; approximately 70% of patients with newly diagnosed melanoma) is low, and whether to perform SLN biopsy in these patients remains controversial. Several predictors of SLN metastasis in patients with thin melanoma have been suggested, but none widely accepted. This article reviews current literature on these predictors in patients with thin melanoma. Although the ability to draw conclusions was limited by the size and design of the available studies, the authors tentatively conclude that SLN biopsy can be considered for patients with melanomas 0.75 mm or larger, those with T1b melanomas (i.e., <or= 1.0 mm; Clark level IV/V and/or ulcerated), and those with thin melanomas with an increased tumor mitotic rate (especially >or= 1 mitosis/mm2). Including younger age (e.g., <or= 40 years) in the decision also seems reasonable, particularly if the primary tumor is associated with a high tumor mitotic rate. Tumor regression does not seem to be associated with an increased risk for SLN metastasis. Firm conclusions on the predictive value of vertical growth phase, absence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or male gender were not possible, particularly if used as a sole criterion for offering this procedure. SLN biopsy should be discussed with all patients with newly diagnosed thin melanoma.",

In this immunocompetent model, propranolol significantly reduced the infiltration of myeloid cells, particularly neutrophils, in the primary tumor. Inversely, cytotoxic tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were more frequent in the tumor stroma of treated mice. In a consistent manner, we observed the same shift in the proportions of infiltrating leukocytes in the metastases of treated mice.

Northern blot analysis revealed that reduced expression was regulated at the transcriptional level, demonstrating a 79% reduction in MART-1 transcript abundance after 32 hours of IFN-gamma treatment. To evaluate consequences of IFN-gamma exposure for immune recognition, MART-1-responsive T cells were reacted with pretreated HLA-matched melanoma cells. Cytotoxicity was reduced up to 78% by IFN-gamma pretreatment, and was restored by addition of MART-1 peptide AAGIGILTV for 2 hours. Examination of melanoma lesions by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed up to 188-fold more abundant IFN-gamma transcripts when compared to control skin. Laser capture microdissection and immunohistology localized most IFN-gamma-producing T cells to the tumor stroma. Reduced MART-1 expression was frequently observed in adjacent tumor cells.

In this study, we evaluated the expression of these MAA with a new monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against MART-1 (M2-7C10) and the commercially available HMB45 mAb directed against gp100. Expression was tested in vitro by intracellular fluorescence analysis and in vivo by immunophenotyping of tissue specimens. Nine melanoma cell lines and 25 tissue specimens from metastatic melanoma were analyzed. One cell line did not express MART-1 or gp100. The expression of both antigens was more heterogeneous and significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in melanoma cell lines compared with melanocytes, suggesting progressive loss of expression of MAA by neoplastic cells. None of the nonmelanoma cancer lines tested stained for MART-1 or gp100. Analysis of melanoma lesions by immunohistochemistry showed significant heterogeneity of expression of both MART-1 and gp100 MAA either as a percentage of cells expressing MAA or as intensity of expression.

Fine needle aspiration of metastatic lesions seemed to yield information accurately about amount and heterogeneity of expression of MAA in tumor lesions in vivo.

Recently, a monoclonal antibody (57B) has become available to examine MAGE protein expression in archival material. In this study, we performed immunohistochemical analysis on 132 melanocytic nevi and 205 melanomas (85 primary cutaneous melanomas and 120 metastatic tumors) to determine the frequency of MAGE expression and to explore a potential correlation with various prognostic parameters. None of the melanocytic nevi and none of the 20 in situ melanomas was immunopositive with the antibody 57B. Immunoreactivity was present in 17 of 65 (26%) primary invasive melanomas of the skin and in 30 of 120 (25%) metastatic tumors. Positive immunostaining did not correlate with tumor stage (P = .66), Breslow thickness (P = .39), Clark level (P = .5), or the histologic type of melanoma (P = .23) but was associated with a brisk infiltrate of lymphocytes involving the vertical growth phase of melanomas (P = .01). Because tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in melanoma are associated with longer survival, our findings suggest a potential prognostic role for MAGE.

Homing of the transferred T cells to all tumor sites in sufficient numbers is of great importance. Here, we seek to exploit endogenous chemotactic signals in order to manipulate and enhance the directional trafficking of transferred T cells toward melanoma. Chemokine profiling of 15 melanoma cultures shows that CXCL1 and CXCL8 are abundantly expressed and secreted from melanoma cultures. However, the complimentary analysis on 40 melanoma patient-derived tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) proves that the corresponding chemokine receptors are either not expressed (CXCR2) or expressed at low levels (CXCR1). Using the in vitro transwell system, we demonstrate that TIL cells preferentially migrate toward melanoma and that endogenously expressing CXCR1 TIL cells are significantly enriched among the migrating lymphocytes. The role of the chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL8 is demonstrated by partial abrogation of this enrichment with anti-CXCL1 and anti-CXCL8 neutralizing antibodies. The role of the chemokine receptor CXCR1 is validated by the enhanced migration of CXCR1-engineered TIL cells toward melanoma or recombinant CXCL8. Cytotoxicity and IFNγ secretion activity are unaltered by CXCR1 expression profile. Taken together, these results mark CXCR1 as a candidate for genetic manipulations to enhance trafficking of adoptively transferred T cells.

The gene coding for the antigen recognized by this clone was identified by the screening of a melanoma complementary DNA expression library. This antigen is overexpressed in melanomas, compared with other cancer cell lines and healthy tissues, and was thus called melanoma-overexpressed antigen (meloe). Remarkably, the structure of meloe was unusual, with multiple short open reading frames (ORFs). The peptide recognized by the CTL clone was encoded by one of these ORFs, called MELOE-1. Using a specific HLA-A2/peptide tetramer, we showed a correlation between the infusion of TILs containing MELOE-1-specific T cells and relapse prevention in HLA-A2 patients. Indeed, 5 out of 9 patients who did not relapse were infused with TILs that contained MELOE-1-specific T cells, whereas 0 out of the 21 patients who relapsed was infused with such TIL-containing lymphocytes.

Several mechanisms may account for this subversion, including the triggering of tolerance to tumor antigens [2, 3], TGF-alpha or IL-10 production, downregulation of MHC molecules, or upregulation of FasL expression [4, 5]. Melanoma cells may in some instances use FasL expression to protect themselves against tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) [4, 5]. Here, we show another, chemokine-dependent mechanism by which melanoma tumor cells shield themselves from immune reactions. Melanoma-inducible CCL5 (RANTES) production by infiltrating CD8 cells activates an apoptotic pathway in TIL involving cytochrome c release into the cytosol and activation of caspase-9 and -3. This process, triggered by CCL5 binding to CCR5, is not mediated by TNFalpha, Fas, or caspase-8. The effect is not unique to CCL5, as other CCR5 ligands such as CCL3 (MIP-1alpha) and CCL4 (MIP-1beta) also trigger TIL cell death, nor is it limited to melanoma cells, as it also operates in activated primary T lymphocytes.

We selected six melanoma-associated antigens (MAGE-A3, NY-ESO-1, gp100, Mart1, tyrosinase and TRP-2) that are frequently recognized in patients with the aim of identifying novel T-cell epitopes restricted to HLA-A1, -A3, -A11 and -B7. Using in silico prediction and in vitro confirmation, we identified 127 MHC ligands and analyzed the T-cell responses against these ligands via the MHC multimer-based enrichment of peripheral blood from 39 melanoma patients and 10 healthy donors. To dissect the T-cell reactivity against this large peptide library, we used combinatorial-encoded MHC multimers and observed the T-cell responses against 17 different peptide-MHC complexes in the patient group and four in the healthy donor group. We confirmed the processing and presentation of HLA-A3-restricted T-cell epitopes from tyrosinase (TQYESGSMDK) and gp100 (LIYRRRLMK) and an HLA-A11-restricted T-cell epitope from gp100 (AVGATKVPR) via the cytolytic T-cell recognition of melanoma cell lines and/or K562 cells expressing the appropriate antigen and HLA molecule. We further found T-cell reactivity against two of the identified sequences among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from melanoma patients, suggesting a potential clinical relevance of these sequences.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanoma is one of the aggressive cancer types causing the majority of deaths in skin cancer patients. Mutational screening of the tumor revealed a number of driver mutations in oncogenes which enabled melanoma classification into a few molecular subtypes. BRAF is a key component of mitogen-activated kinase pathway; its activating mutation leads to accelerated melanoma cells proliferation, invasion and survival. Somatic mutations in BRAF were reported in various malignancies, including thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer and melanoma. Specific features of BRAF-positive tumors could have clinical implications as mutational alterations may have an impact on the biological behavior of the tumor and prognosis of the disease. In the present study, the frequency of BRAF V600E mutation was evaluated in Russian patients with melanocytic lesions, of which 41.25% were primary melanoma and 60% were melanocytic nevi. Melanoma patients with trunk localization were of younger age in the BRAF-positive group as compared with BRAF-negative patients. Immunohistochemical evaluations of Ki-67 expression, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-2, -9, were found to be equal in BRAF-positive and BRAF-negative tumors. MMP-2/MMP-9 immunoreactivity was observed in stromal and/or melanocytic cells both in melanoma and nevi patients. Besides tumor cells, MMP-9 expression was observed in lymphocytes in 27.2% of BRAF-positive and in 19.1% of BRAF-negative patients. Histopathological prognostic markers (Breslow thickness, mitotic index, ulceration, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes pattern) did not show any differences depending on BRAF V600E mutational status. The frequency of BRAF-positive melanomas in Russian cohort is similar to other Caucasian population rates. BRAF V600E mutation harboring tumors are more often observed in younger patients without specific features of morphological prognostic factors. ",

Cultured TIL have been studied in order to unveil characteristics of TIL and the interactions of TIL and melanoma cells. Whether in vitro cultured TIL mirrors the in situ situation has, however, been questioned. In the present study we have taken advantage of T-cell receptor clonotype mapping methodology to conduct a full and detailed analysis of the T-cell clonotypes in melanoma lesions and in corresponding lines of TIL established in vitro. All melanoma lesions and the corresponding TIL cultures comprised high numbers of T-cell clonotypes, typically in the range of 40 to more than 60. The subsequent comparison of T-cell clonotypes present in the original lesions and in the corresponding T-cell lines established in vitro demonstrated that a very limited number of the T-cell clonotypes established in vitro are identical to the T-cell clonotypes expanded in situ. These results demonstrate that in situ T-cell clonotypes in melanoma are not readily expanded in vitro and that the majority of T-cell clonotypes present in cultured TIL are not present in situ.",

The specimens consisted of 129 tissue samples including superficial (Breslow ≤ 1 mm) and deep (Breslow > 4 mm) melanomas and lymph node metastases. The differences in immunostainings were analysed with non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test.

Survival between patient groups was compared by the Kaplan-Meier method using log rank test and Cox's regression model was used for multivariate analyses.;The expression of HAS1 and HAS2 was decreased in deep melanomas and metastases compared to superficial melanomas. Decreased immunostaining of HAS2 in melanoma cells was significantly associated with several known unfavourable histopathologic prognostic markers like increased mitotic count, absence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and the nodular subtype. Furthermore, reduced HAS1 and HAS2 immunostaining in the melanoma cells was associated with increased recurrence of melanoma (p = 0.041 and p = 0.006, respectively) and shortened disease- specific survival (p = 0.013 and p = 0.001, respectively).;This study indicates that reduced expression of HAS1 and HAS2 is associated with melanoma progression and suggests that HAS1 and HAS2 have a prognostic significance in cutaneous melanoma.",

Cases were analyzed for KIT protein expression relative to histologic variables: subtype, sun damage, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, melanoma in situ, vertical growth phase (VGP), location, and hyperpigmentation. Twenty-eight cases demonstrated 3+ membranous staining. Univariate analysis revealed 5 significant variables: sun damage (inverse, P = 0.015), tumor location (trunk>extremities>head and neck, P = 0.005), subtype (epithelioid>spindle, mixed>desmoplastic, P < 0.001), VGP (inverse, P = 0.024), and hyperpigmentation [22/26 (85% hyperpigmented cases) and 6/44 (14% nonhyperpigmented cases), P < 0.001]. Upon multivariate analysis, only hyperpigmentation and VGP remained statistically significant (P = 0.002, P = 0.019). Mutational analyses for KIT exons 9 and 11, and BRAF were performed on cases with 3+ labeling. Two of 27 of cases contained mutations in KIT exon 11, whereas only 1 case contained a V600E BRAF mutation, suggesting that KIT and BRAF mutations may be redundant events. Although KIT mutations were uncommon overall, pigmentation in conjunction with immunohistochemistry and nodular growth phase raised their frequency to 2 (40%) of 5 cases. We expand the context of KIT aberrations to involve areas other than acral and mucosal sites and demonstrate an inverse relationship between KIT abnormalities and sun damage. There is a strong correlation to hyperpigmentation that overrides factors including sun damage, tumor location, and histologic subtype, which may be used to identify cases with KIT aberrations.",

In current practice, most patients with BRAF V600 mutant melanomas will see both modalities. Several in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that combining immunotherapy with MAPK inhibition may have synergistic effects. First, mouse models show that adoptive cell therapy (ACT) can be enhanced by vaccination. Rapid tumor destruction by vemurafenib could provide a vaccine-like stimulus to adoptively transferred T cells. Second, both in mice and in early clinical trials, melanoma metastases treated with MAPK inhibitors seem to display increased T-cell infiltrates. Third, MAPK inhibition upregulates the expression of some melanoma antigens and, therefore, may enhance T-cell recognition of vemurafenib-treated melanomas. Fourth, vemurafenib may sensitize tumor cells to immune destruction. Finally, some investigators have found that an optimal antitumor effect from MAPK inhibition is dependent on an intact host immune response. Currently, the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute has initiated a phase II trial combining the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib with ACT using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients with BRAF-mutant tumors to investigate the safety and efficacy of this combination. The proposed mechanisms for synergy between these two modalities can be complex, and their optimal combination may require testing a variety of sequences and schedules.",

In response to its cognate antigen, each clone used for treatment secreted large amounts of interferon-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, lesser amounts of interleukin (IL)-2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and little or no IL-4 and IL-10. Clones also demonstrated recognition of human leukocyte antigen-matched melanomas using cytokine secretion and lysis assays. Twelve patients received 2 cycles of cells alone; 11 patients received additional cycles of cells and were randomized between two schedules of IL-2 (125,000 IU/kg subcutaneously daily for 12 days versus 720,000 IU/kg intravenously every 8 h for 4 days). A total of 51 cycles of cells were administered, with an average of 1 x 10(10) cells per cycle. Peripheral blood samples were analyzed for persistence of transferred cells by T-cell receptor-specific polymerase chain reaction. Transferred cells reached a maximum level at 1 h after transfer but rapidly declined to undetectable levels by 2 weeks. One minor response and one mixed response were observed (both in the high-dose IL-2 arm).

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression determined factors associated with a low risk of SLN positivity. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to stratify groups based on risk of positivity.;Of the 952 study patients, 157 (16.5 %) had a positive SLN. In the multivariate analysis, thickness <1.5 mm (odds ratio [OR] 0.29), age ≥60 (OR 0.69), present tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (OR 0.60), absent lymphovascular invasion (OR 0.46), and absent satellitosis (OR 0.44) were significantly associated with a low risk of SLN positivity. CART analysis identified thickness of 1.5 mm as the primary cut point for risk of SLN metastasis. Patients with a thickness of <1.5 mm represented 36 % of the total cohort and had a SLN positivity rate of 6.6 % (95 % confidence interval 3.8-9.4 %). In patients with melanomas <1.5 mm in thickness, the presence of additional low risk factors identified 257 patients (75 % of patients with <1.5 mm melanomas) in which the rate of SLN positivity was <5 %.;Despite a SLN positivity rate of 16.5 % overall, substantial heterogeneity of risk exists among patients with intermediate-thickness melanoma.

Although both approaches have shown considerable promise, response rates to these therapies remain suboptimal. We hypothesized that a combinatorial approach to immunotherapy using both CTLA-4 blockade and nonlymphodepletional ACT could offer additive therapeutic benefit. C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with syngeneic B16F10 melanoma tumors transfected to express low levels of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus peptide GP33 (B16GP33), and treated with no immunotherapy, CTLA-4 blockade, ACT, or combination immunotherapy of CTLA-4 blockade with ACT. Combination immunotherapy resulted in optimal control of B16GP33 melanoma tumors. Combination immunotherapy promoted a stronger local immune response reflected by enhanced tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte populations, and a stronger systemic immune responses reflected by more potent tumor antigen-specific T-cell activity in splenocytes. In addition, whereas both CTLA-4 blockade and combination immunotherapy were able to promote long-term immunity against B16GP33 tumors, only combination immunotherapy was capable of promoting immunity against parental B16F10 tumors as well. Our findings suggest that a combinatorial approach using CTLA-4 blockade with nonlymphodepletional ACT may promote additive endogenous and exogenous T-cell activities that enable greater therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of melanoma.

Moreover, CD8⁺ TILs from patients exhibited downregulation of the costimulatory molecule CD226, which competes with TIGIT for the same ligand, supporting a TIGIT/CD226 imbalance in metastatic melanoma. TIGIT marked early T cell activation and was further upregulated by T cells upon PD-1 blockade and in dysfunctional PD-1⁺TIM-3⁺ TA-specific CD8⁺ T cells. PD-1⁺TIGIT⁺, PD-1⁻TIGIT⁺, and PD-1⁺TIGIT⁻ CD8⁺ TILs had similar functional capacities ex vivo, suggesting that TIGIT alone, or together with PD-1, is not indicative of T cell dysfunction. However, in the presence of TIGIT ligand-expressing cells, TIGIT and PD-1 blockade additively increased proliferation, cytokine production, and degranulation of both TA-specific CD8⁺ T cells and CD8⁺ TILs. Collectively, our results show that TIGIT and PD-1 regulate the expansion and function of TA-specific CD8⁺ T cells and CD8⁺ TILs in melanoma patients and suggest that dual TIGIT and PD-1 blockade should be further explored to elicit potent antitumor CD8⁺ T cell responses in patients with advanced melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Despite their well-documented immunogenicity, malignant melanomas belong to the most aggressive tumor types. A potential explanation for this is the suboptimal activation of tumor infiltrating T cells. In order to boost immune responses against tumors, a variety of treatment modalities have been tested in animal models and in clinical setting. Antigen-nonspecific approaches (e.g., IFN-alpha and IL-2), as well as active specific immunotherapeutical modalities based on the use of autologous or allogeneic tumor cell-save been investigated in clinical trials of melanoma. The identification of melanoma-associated antigens has opened new avenues in antigen-specific immunotherapy. A promising alternative for the delivery of different forms of melanoma antigens is the application of dendritic cells, the most potent antigen presenting cells capable of eliciting efficient T-cell response. Beside active immunotherapy, immune response against melanoma antigens could be increased through the adoptive transfer of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or antigen specific T-cell clones. The most important conclusion that can be drawn from the results of published immunotherapy studies is that these modalities are able to induce durable complete tumor regressions,mostly with reasonable toxicity; however, generally only in a minority of patients. This points to the importance of appropriate patient selection, with regard to the expression of the targeted antigens and HLA molecules, as well as to the general immunocompetence of the patients. A crucial and still unsolved question is monitoring immune activation during treatment, although there are promising new tools that could prove useful in this respect. The presence of tumor-reactive CTL in the circulation or in the tumors does not guarantee an efficient immune response. It is important to assess if these T cells are in an activated and functional state. Finally, in several single target antigen-based clinical studies a therapy-induced immunoselection of antigen-negative clones, leading to disease progression, was observed. This could be overcome with the use of antigen cocktails or whole tumor approaches. A better understanding of the mechanisms of action of immunotherapeutical modalities may enhance the success rate of these strategies.",

Although cDNAs encoding the previously identified melanoma Ags, tyrosinase and gp100, were isolated, these TIL were found to recognize previously unidentified peptides. An HLA-A1-restricted CTL, TIL1388, was found to recognize a tyrosinase peptide (SSDYVIPIGTY), and an HLA-A3-restricted CTL, TIL1351, recognized a gp100 peptide (LIYRRRLMK). CTL clones isolated from the HLA-A2-restricted TIL1383 recognized a gp100 peptide (RLMKQDFSV). HLA-A2-restricted CTL, TIL1200, recognized a gp100 peptide (RLPRIFCSC). Replacement of either cysteine residue with alpha-amino butyric acid in the gp100 peptide, RLPRIFCSC, enhanced CTL recognition, suggesting that the peptide epitope naturally presented on the tumor cell surface may contain reduced cysteine residues. Oxidation of these cysteines might have occurred during the course of the synthesis or pulsing of the peptide in culture. These modifications may have important implications for the development of efficient peptide-based vaccines.

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are thought to play a crucial rôle in tumor immunosurveillance. In malignant melanoma expression and secretion of monocyte-chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) have been demonstrated. MCP-1 serves as an attractant for monocytes and activated T-cells. In this study we addressed the question whether circulating monocytes show altered chemotaxis to MCP-1. Therefore the chemotactic responsiveness of monocytes towards MCP-1 was investigated in patients with primary and metastatic melanoma and compared to patients with basal cell carcinoma and healthy persons. The results show that monocytes from melanoma patients showed a significantly decreased chemotactic migration towards MCP-1 while chemotaxis to the stimulus N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) remained normal. Patients with basal cell carcinoma showed normal monocyte chemotaxis to all stimuli tested. In primary melanoma, there was no relation of the number of TAM or TIL to the decreased chemotaxis of circulating monocytes to MCP-1. From these data it can be concluded that circulating monocytes from patients with primary and metastatic melanoma show a MCP-1-specific decrease in chemotactic migration. This may be due to deactivation or modulation of the MCP-1-receptor expression on these cells.",

Four predominantly CD8+ and two mixed CD4+, CD8+ population TIL cultures were tested for lysis in short-term 51Cr-release assays against a panel of targets including 29 fresh melanomas, 2 fresh sarcomas, 11 cultured melanoma lines, and 14 nonmelanoma cell lines derived from HLA-typed patients. All six melanoma TILs lysed the autologous melanoma. Two of three TILs from HLA-A2+ patients lysed allogeneic melanomas matched for HLA-A2, giving evidence for shared tumor Ag; one of these TILs also used HLA-B44 as a restriction element. The third HLA-A2+ TIL lysed autologous melanoma but not autologous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells nor 14 HLA-A2 matched allogeneic melanomas, suggesting the possibility of a unique tumor Ag in this system. The three HLA-A2- TILs each lysed multiple HLA-matched melanomas, using HLA-A24, HLA-A31, and HLA-Cw7 as restriction elements. Blocking of autologous and allogeneic melanoma lysis by TILs with mAb w6/32 (anti-MHC class I) and anti-CD3, as well as cold target inhibition assays, confirmed that specific interaction of the T-cell receptor with MHC class I Ag and the relevant tumor Ag on the target cell surface is required for tumor lysis.

Previous studies show that upon cell contact, various membrane-associated proteins, such as Ras-family proteins, transfer from B to T and NK lymphocytes. Mutations in RAS genes that encode constitutively active, GTP-bound, oncoproteins are rather common in human cancers; for instance, melanoma. Cancer immunoediting has been postulated to contribute to the elimination of malignant melanoma. Thus, we asked whether Ras oncoproteins can transfer from melanoma to T cells, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and subsequently induce functional effects in the adopting T cells. To explore this issue, we genetically engineered an HLA-A2(+) melanoma cell line, MEL526, to express GFP or GFP-tagged H-Ras mutants stably. In this study, we show by an in vitro coculture system that GFP-tagged H-Ras, but not GFP, transfers from MEL526 to T cells and localizes to the inner aspect of their plasma membrane. This cell-contact-dependent process was increased by TCR stimulation and did not require strict Ag specificity. Importantly, we found a positive correlation between the levels of the acquired constitutively active H-RasG12V and ERK1/2 phosphorylation within the adopting TILs. We also show a significant increase in IFN-γ production and cytotoxic activity in TILs that acquired H-RasG12V compared to TILs that acquired a different H-Ras mutant.

Nevertheless, the majority of patients progress either directly upon therapy or after an initial period of tumor control. Recent data have shown that most TIL products that are used for therapy contain only low frequencies of T cells reactive against known melanoma-associated epitopes. Because of this, the development of a technology to create T-cell products that are enriched for reactivity against defined melanoma-associated antigens would seem valuable, both to evaluate the tumoricidal potential of T cells directed against different antigen classes and to potentially increase response rates. Here, we developed and validated a conditional MHC streptamer-based platform for the creation of TIL products with defined antigen reactivities. We have used this platform to successfully enrich both high-frequency (≥1%) and low-frequency (<1%) tumor-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations, and thereby created T-cell products with enhanced tumor recognition potential. Collectively, these data demonstrate that selection of antigen-specific T-cell populations can be used to create defined T-cell products for clinical use. This strategy thus forms a highly flexible platform for the development of antigen-specific cell products for personalized cancer immunotherapy. ",

Four out of 27 clones showed substantial cytotoxicity against autologous melanoma and one clone, designated as No. 8a-5 (CD3+, CD4-, CD8+, CD56-), selectively killed autologous melanoma but did not kill six different allogeneic melanoma, K562, or autologous or allogeneic Con A lymphoblast targets. Cytotoxicity of No. 8a-5 cells was inhibited by anti-HLA class I MAb (w6/32), by anti-beta 2-microglobulin MAb, and by anti-CD3 (OKT3) MAb, suggesting that the specific cytotoxicity was HLA class I-restricted and that the clone utilized the T-cell receptor complex for recognition of targets. Pretreatment with rIFN-gamma increased the sensitivity of autologous melanoma targets to lysis by No. 8a-5 cells. Exogenous rIL-4 enhanced [3H]TdR incorporation by these TIL. In contrast, rIFN-gamma reduced the sensitivity of the autologous melanoma to lysis by uncloned TIL, and rIL-4 suppressed the cytotoxicity and cell proliferation of uncloned TIL.

Inhibition occurred during the first 24 hours of co-culture and persisted as long as the tumor was present. After being washed free of inhibitory tumor cells, the TIL again were able to grow in the presence of IL-2, indicating that the inhibition was not caused by irreversible toxicity mediated by the tumor. Addition of excess IL-2 did not reverse the inhibitory effect, but addition of indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and prostaglandin synthesis, partially blocked the inhibition.

This therapeutic approach is aimed at targeting T-cell costimulation to chemotherapy-resistant tumors which are refractory and been considered as untreatable cancers. These tumors are usually defined by an enrichment of cancer stem cells and characterized by the higher expression of chemotherapy-resistant proteins. In this work we develop the first aptamer that targets chemotherapy-resistant tumors expressing MRP1 through a novel combinatorial peptide-cell SELEX. With the use of the MRP1 aptamer we engineer a MRP1-CD28 bivalent aptamer that is able to bind MRP1-expressing tumors and deliver the CD28 costimulatory signal to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The bi-specific aptamer is able to enhance costimulation in chemotherapy-resistant tumors. Melanoma-bearing mice systemically treated with MRP1-CD28 bivalent aptamer show reduced growth, thus proving an improved mice survival.Besides, we have designed a technically feasible and translational whole-cell vaccine (Aptvax). Disaggregated cells from tumors can be directly decorated with costimulatory ligand aptamers to generate the vaccine Aptvax.

Furthermore, T-cell clones isolated from these cultures showed both CD8(+) and CD4(+) transduced T cells could recognize HLA-A2(+) melanoma cells, giving us the possibility of engineering class I MHC-restricted effector and T helper cells against melanoma.

Forty-two chemokine, cytokine, angiogenic, and growth factors were measured in the sera of 20 BRAF inhibitor-treated and four combination BRAF and MEK inhibitor-treated metastatic melanoma patients using a multiplex chemokine assay. The changes were correlated with Ki-67 and CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor biopsies taken at the same time points, as well as clinical outcome, including response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Serum levels of IFN-γ, CCL4, and TNF-α were significantly increased, whereas CXCL8 significantly decreased from pretreatment (PRE) to early during treatment (EDT) serum samples. The decrease in serum CXCL8 levels from PRE to EDT significantly correlated with decreases in markers of melanoma proliferation (Ki-67) and increases in cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating T cells in corresponding tumor biopsies. In addition, a greater fold reduction in CXCL8 serum levels from PRE to EDT serum samples was associated with decreased overall survival. These results suggest that BRAF inhibition causes decreased CXCL8 secretion from melanoma cells and induce an immune response against the tumor associated with increased IFN-γ, CCL4, and TNF-α. Further studies are needed to determine if CXCL8 is predictive of response and to confirm the functions of these chemokine and cytokine in BRAF-mutant melanoma under BRAF inhibition. ",

One major limitation of these current therapies is the frequent inability to isolate tumor-reactive lymphocytes for treatment. Genetic engineering of peripheral blood lymphocytes with retroviral vectors encoding tumor antigen-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) bypasses this restriction. To evaluate the efficacy of TCR gene therapy, a murine treatment model was developed. A retroviral vector was constructed encoding the pmel-1 TCR genes targeting the B16 melanoma antigen, gp100. Transduction of C57BL/6 lymphocytes resulted in efficient pmel-1 TCR expression. Lymphocytes transduced with this retrovirus specifically recognized gp100-pulsed target cells as measured by interferon-gamma secretion assays. Upon transfer into B16 tumor-bearing mice, the genetically engineered lymphocytes significantly slowed tumor development. The effectiveness of tumor treatment was directly correlated with the number of TCR-engineered T cells administered. These results demonstrated that TCR gene therapy targeting a native tumor antigen significantly delayed the growth of established tumors. When C57BL/6 lymphocytes were added to antigen-reactive pmel-1 T cells, a reduction in the ability of pmel-1 T cell to treat B16 melanomas was seen, suggesting that untransduced cells may be deleterious to TCR gene therapy. This model may be a powerful tool for evaluating future TCR gene transfer-based strategies.",

Homing receptor expression on lymphocytes strongly correlated with MMel dissemination. Loss of CCR6 or CXCR3, but not cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA), on circulating T cell subsets was associated with skin or lymph node metastases, loss of CXCR4, CXCR5, and CCR9 corresponded with lung involvement, and a rise in CCR10 or CD103 was associated with widespread dissemination. High frequencies of CD8+CCR9+ naive T cells correlated with prolonged OS, while neutralizing the CCR9/CCL25 axis in mice stimulated tumor progression. The expansion of CLA-expressing effector memory CD8+ T cells in response to a single administration of CTLA4 blockade predicted disease control at 3 months in 47 patients with MMel. Thus, specific CCR/CXCR expression patterns on circulating T lymphocytes may guide potential diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. ",

We observed between 0 and 4 mitoses in 40 high-power fields. Only 4 melanomas showed more than 100 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in 20 high-power fields. Nine tumors showed extra-scleral spread, nine displayed vascular networks. Univariate Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed as significant prognostic factors: localization in the iris only (p = 0.0008), spindle cell type (p = 0.0002) and absence of vascular networks (p = 0.01). This was confirmed by multivariate Cox analysis.;Patients with diffuse malignant melanoma confined to the iris alone have a good prognosis for survival. Diffuse tumor cell spread can be diagnosed at the slitlamp with high magnification. Conservative follow-up is acceptable, as long as ciliary body involvement is ruled out.

Immunomodulatory strategies initiated after progression have recently been reported to be poorly efficient. By characterizing the immunological interactions between T cells and cancer cells in clinical material as well as the influence of the FDA-approved BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib on the immune system, we aimed at unraveling new strategies to expand the efficacy of adoptive T-cell transfer, which represents one of the most promising approaches currently in clinical development for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Here we show that blocking the BRAF-MAPK pathway in BRAF signaling-addicted melanoma cells significantly increases the ability of T cells contained in clinical grade tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to recognize autologous BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma cell lines in vitro. Antitumor reactivity was improved regardless of the class of antigen recognized by tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells. Microarray data suggests that improved tumor recognition is associated with modified expression of MHC Class I-associated proteins as well as of heat-shock proteins. In conclusion, our preclinical data suggest that an appropriately timed sequential treatment of BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma with vemurafenib and adoptive T-cell transfer might result in synergistic antineoplastic effects owing to an increased immunogenicity of cancer cells.",

Nearly complete regression of multiple metastatic melanoma lesions was observed in patient 1913 following adoptive transfer of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The autologous 1913 melanoma cell line expressed a mutated HLA-A11 class I gene product that was recognized by the bulk tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as well as a dominant T cell clone derived from this line. A second dominant T cell clone, T1D1, did not recognize the mutated HLA-A11 product, but recognized an allogeneic melanoma cell line that shared expression of HLA-A11 with the parental tumor cell line. Screening of an autologous melanoma cDNA library with clone T1D1 T cells in a cell line expressing the mutated HLA-A11 gene product resulted in the isolation of a p14ARF transcript containing a 2-bp deletion in exon 2. The T cell epitope recognized by T1D1, which was encoded within the frameshifted region of the deleted p14ARF transcript, was also generated from frameshifted p14ARF or p16INK4a transcripts that were isolated from two additional melanoma cell lines. The results of monitoring studies indicated that T cell clones reactive with the mutated HLA-A11 gene product and the mutated p14ARF product were highly represented in the peripheral blood of patient 1913 1 wk following adoptive transfer, indicating that they may have played a role in the nearly complete tumor regression that was observed following this treatment.",

However, the majority of patients receiving BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) manifest disease progression within a year. We have recently shown that melanoma patients treated with BRAFi exhibit an increase in melanoma-associated antigens and in CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in response to therapy. To characterize such a T-cell infiltrate, we analyzed the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of rearranged T-cell receptor (TCR) β chain-coding genes in tumor biopsies obtained before the initiation of BRAFi and 10-14 d later. We observed an increase in the clonality of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in 7 of 8 patients receiving BRAFi, with a statistically significant 21% aggregate increase in clonality. Over 80% of individual T-cell clones detected after initiation of BRAFi treatment were new clones. Interestingly, the comparison of tumor infiltrates with clinical responses revealed that patients who had a high proportion of pre-existing dominant clones after the administration of BRAFi responded better to therapy than patients who had a low proportion of such pre-existing dominant clones following BRAFi. These data suggest that although the inhibition of BRAF in melanoma patients results in tumor infiltration by new lymphocytes, the response to treatment appears to be related to the presence of a pre-existing population of tumor-infiltrating T-cell clones.",

To determine if T-cell-defined melanoma antigens are expressed on other tumors of neuroectodermal origin, four melanoma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) cultures derived from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were tested for lysis of a panel of 23 HLA-A2+ neuroectodermal tumor cell lines of various histologies, including retinoblastoma (1), neuroblastoma (8), neuroepithelioma (6), astrocytoma (2), neuroglioma (1), and Ewing's sarcoma (5). Low expression of MHC class I and/or ICAM-1 molecules was found on 22 of 23 neuroectodermal tumor lines, and could be enhanced by treatment with interferon gamma (IFN gamma). Following IFN gamma treatment, three Ewing's sarcoma lines were lysed by at least one melanoma TIL culture, and levels of lysis were comparable to melanoma lysis by these TIL. Lysis could be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies directed against MHC class I molecules and against CD3, indicating specific immune recognition of tumor-associated antigens. None of the other neuroectodermal tumors tested were lysed by TIL, but they could be lysed by non-MHC-restricted lymphokine-activated killer cells. This demonstration of immunological cross-reactivity between melanomas and Ewing's sarcomas, two tumors of distinct histological types with a common embryonic origin, has implications for the developmental nature of these CTL-defined tumor antigens.

Logistic regression and classification tree analyses were used to investigate the association between SLN positivity and Breslow thickness, Clark level, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), ulceration, mitotic rate (MR), lesion site, gender, and age. RESULTS.: In all, 88 of the 682 patients had > or =1 positive SLN (12.9%). In the multivariate analysis, MR, TIL, and thickness were found to be independent prognostic factors for SLN positivity.

IL-2-activated TILs from 25 of 42 metastatic melanomas (60%) displayed oligoclonal expansion, whereas IL-2-activated peripheral bllod mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from only 2 of 20 patients (10%) did so during 2-5 weeks in culture. Skin-derived lymphocytes from 20 patients were cultured; only four samples proliferated and none showed oligoclonal expansion. Preferential oligoclonal expansion of TILs was observed in V beta 8+ cells (10/42, P less than 0.05), V beta 6.7+ cells (7/42, P less than 0.05), and V alpha 2+ cells (7/42, not significant). Oligoclonal expansion of V beta 8+ cells was primarily found in T cells from subcutaneous metastases (8/20 cases, P less than 0.05), whereas that of V beta 6.7+ cells and V alpha 2+ cells was also found in T cells from lymph node or organ metastases. These mAbs to TCR V regions stimulated effector TILs to produce interferon-gamma, but not IL-2 or IL-4. Subcutaneous tumor-specific (V beta 8+ cells) and non-specific (V beta 6.7+ cells and V alpha 2+ cells) oligoclonalities were observed in IL-2-activated melanoma TILs, suggesting different immune responses among different sites of metastases.",

The appreciation of the role of immune checkpoints has also led to therapeutic approaches that illustrate the effectiveness of blocking negative regulators of the antitumor immune response.

Both in VGP and in nodal metastases, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) may be present with different patterns. In the evaluation of the primary tumor, these patterns have been defined as brisk, non-brisk, and absent. The histologic slides of regional lymph node metastases, the site of first recurrence in 99 consecutive melanoma patients, were reviewed. Disease-free survival of these cases and whether or not they were treated with rIFN alpha-2A was recorded to identify any relationship among different patterns of TILs, therapy, and prognosis. Of 99 cases, 16 were classified as brisk, 37 as non-brisk, and 46 as absent. At 30 months of follow-up the disease-free survival was 81.3% for brisk cases, 46.8% for non-brisk cases, and 29.3% for absent groups (p = .007). Multivariate analysis confirmed the prognostic value of TILs in predicting disease-free survival in patients with regional node metastases. The difference according to the presence or absence of relapse is particularly evident when comparison is made between treated and untreated patients. In conclusion the evaluation of first-recurrence regional node melanoma metastases for TILs, using the same histopathologic criteria as in VGP of primary melanoma, subdivides the cases in brisk, non-brisk, and absent groups. Also, the presence of these patterns in metastatic node melanoma deposits is correlatable to disease-free survival. Our results further stress the difference of prognosis patients treated with rIFN alpha-2A compared to the untreated group. The TILs evaluation may prove useful in selecting those melanoma stage II patients who will best respond to therapy with biologic response modifiers, because the TILs may be the local immune effector cell targets of rIFN alpha-2A or of other biologic agents.",

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) generated from the H-2Kb+ BL6 lesions (Thy 1.2+, CD8+, CD4-) efficiently lysed H-2Kb+ melanoma (CL8-1 and 2Kb38) and the H-2Kb+ nonrelated 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA)-105 sarcoma, but not the H-2Kb- parental melanoma BL6-8. This strongly suggests that CL8-1, 2Kb38, and MCA-105 express identical or cross-reactive T cell epitopes recognized by CL8-1 TILs in the context of the H-2Kb class I allele. To identify the T cell epitopes, peptides were acid-eluted from various cells, and fractionated by HPLC. Five HPLC fractions (F1mel-F5mel) of 70 tested contained peptides derived from H-2Kb+ CL8-1 melanoma (but not H-2Kb- melanomas) that were capable of conferring susceptibility to CL8-1 TIL lysis on H-2b-expressing target cells (EL4, C1R.Kb), but not on H-2d-expressing P815 target cells. CL8-1 TILs failed to recognize peptides derived from H-2Kb+ nonmelanoma targets such as EL4 or normal B6 splenocytes. Interestingly, CL8-1 TILs appeared to recognize peptide species contained in two HPLC fractions derived from the MCA-105 sarcoma (F1sar and F5sar). Conversely, TILs derived from MCA-105 lesions recognized MCA-105 and CL8-1 tumor cells, as well as F5mel and F5sar peptides presented by EL4 targets.

Dead feeder cells disappeared during the last phase of the lymphocyte culture with rIL-2. Interestingly, each time they were expanded under these conditions, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) or lymph-node lymphocytes developed a lytic activity apparently restricted to the autologous melanoma line. Tumor-specific lysis, which was maximum at around the end of T-lymphocyte expansion, ranged between 31-63% lysis at an effector:target (E:T) ratio of 20:1.

The degree of such infiltration and cell activation are considered significant prognostic factors reflecting the host's immune response to the tumor; thus, patients with peritumoral infiltration may have a better prognosis and may also achieve a better response to interleukin-2 (IL2) immunotherapy. There is evidence that the expression of cluster designation (CD) 25 antigen (IL2 receptor [IL2R]) is a good marker of activity of T lymphocytes against melanoma cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vivo the binding of 99mTc-IL2 to lymphocytes infiltrating cutaneous melanoma and to determine whether such uptake correlates with immunologic and histologic data, thus providing useful prognostic information for IL2 therapy in patients with advanced disease.;Thirty patients with cutaneous lesions suspected of being melanoma were studied. Planar gamma-camera images over known tumor sites were acquired 1 h after the injection of 111-185 MBq of 99mTc-IL2. Tumor uptake of 99mTc-IL2 was measured as a target-to-background (T/B) radioactivity ratio. All patients underwent surgery, and histologic evaluation of the resected lesion was performed. The percentage of different peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16, CD25) and the percentage of IL2R-positive tumor cells on histologic sections were also measured.;At final histology, 21 lesions were found to be melanoma and 9 were classified as benign. In 15 of 21 (71%) melanomas and 2 of 9 (22%) benign cutaneous lesions, we found uptake of 99mTc-IL2.

Nonetheless, only a few mutated epitopes efficiently presented by human tumors have thus far been identified. We describe here an approach to identify such epitopes. This approach involves: 1) identifying tumors expressing a ras mutation and isolating the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL); 2) transfecting COS cells to induce expression of unknown mutated peptides in the context of a patient's HLA class I molecules; and 3) screening epitope recognition by using TIL from the tumors expressing a ras mutation. By using this approach, there appeared to be a N-ras mutation (a glutamine-to-arginine exchange at residue 61 (Q61R)), detected in a melanoma lesion, which was recognized specifically by the autologous TIL in the HLA-A*0101 context. The ras peptide 55-64(Q61R) was the epitope of these TIL and was regularly presented by Q61R-mutated HLA-A*0101(+) melanoma cell lines. This peptide and its wild-type homolog (55-64(wt)) bound to HLA-A*0101 with similar affinities. However, only the mutated peptide could induce specific CTL expansion from PBL. All the CTL clones specific to the mutated peptide, failed to recognize the wild-type sequence on both COS and melanoma cells. These data thus show that oncogenic protein mutations can create shared tumor-specific CTL epitopes, efficiently presented by tumor cells, and that screening for oncogene-transfected COS cell recognition by TIL (from tumors containing mutations) is a powerful approach for the identification of these epitopes.",

Early in the treatment course, a high fever, a diffuse rash, hearing loss, and bilateral anterior uveitis developed acutely in the patient. Late autoimmune sequelae included the development of alopecia, vitiligo, poliosis, and bilateral panuveitis with diffuse retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) hypopigmentation, reminiscent of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome. Bilateral cystoid macular edema also developed that was responsive to acetazolamide. Serial EOGs showed alterations in RPE standing potentials in dark conditions, and MP-1 testing revealed diminished foveal and perifoveal sensitivity. An aqueous humor aspirate revealed a high concentration of melanoma tumor antigen-reactive T cells compared with that of peripheral blood samples, as well as a proinflammatory aqueous cytokine profile. At the time of cataract surgery 22 months after immunotherapy, a repeat aqueous humor sample showed the disappearance of the previously seen melanoma differentiation antigen-reactive lymphocytes, but the proinflammatory cytokine profile persisted.;Ocular and systemic autoimmune sequelae resembling VKH may develop after successful melanoma immunotherapy. This report provides insight into the pathogenesis of VKH disease. The patient's clinical course illustrates the fine balance between tumor-specific immunity and loss of self-tolerance.;The author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.",

Comparison of the BV-expression in regressive versus progressive regions of the same tumor revealed major differences in all cases examined. Direct sequencing of RT-PCR products indicated that highly expressed BV-gene families were of clonal origin in both the regressive and progressive regions. Together, these data strongly suggest the occurrence of clonal T cell responses in both regressive and progressive areas of the same primary tumor.

We investigated the potential of colorectal cancer TIL as a source of killer cells and the effect of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) in combination with IL2 on their cytotoxic activity. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were isolated from surgical specimens using a mechanical and enzymatic dissociation process. Autologous lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) were used as control. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and LPMC were cultured in the presence of IL2 with/without TNF alpha (1000 U/ml each) for 5 to 8 weeks. Cytotoxicity (% lysis) was tested against Daudi target cells in a 4-hr 51Cr-release assay. The combination of IL2 and TNF alpha resulted in a significantly greater-fold expansion of TIL than IL2 alone (P less than 0.01). Lamina propria mononuclear cells expanded less than TIL, and TNF alpha had an inhibitory effect on their growth (P less than 0.05). Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and LPMC showed comparable cytotoxicity when cultured with IL2 alone. However, the addition of TNF alpha augmented the killer activity of TIL while inhibiting that of LPMC (P = 0.035). These results indicate that TNF alpha selectively increases the IL2-induced growth and cytotoxic function of colorectal cancer TIL, but not those of gut mucosal lymphoid cells, suggesting that TIL and LMPC differ in their response to TNF alpha. Therefore, this combination of cytokines may hold more promise than single agents for the immunotherapy of colorectal cancers with TIL.",

Among these, some malignant cancers such as oral melanoma, osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, and mast cell tumor are often recognized as clinical problems because, despite their high frequencies, current treatments for these cancers may not always achieve satisfying outcomes. The absence of effective systemic therapies against these cancers leads researchers to investigate novel therapeutic modalities, including immunotherapy. Programmed death 1 (PD-1) is a costimulatory receptor with immunosuppressive function. When it binds its ligands, PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) or PD-L2, PD-1 on T cells negatively regulates activating signals from the T cell receptor, resulting in the inhibition of the effector function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Aberrant PD-L1 expression has been reported in many human cancers and is considered an immune escape mechanism for cancers. In clinical trials, anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies induced tumor regression for several malignancies, including advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. In this study, to assess the potential of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis as a novel therapeutic target for canine cancer immunotherapy, immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1 expression in various malignant cancers of dogs was performed. Here, we show that dog oral melanoma, osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, mast cell tumor, mammary adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma expressed PD-L1, whereas some other types of cancer did not. In addition, PD-1 was highly expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes obtained from oral melanoma, showing that lymphocytes in this cancer type might have been functionally exhausted. These results strongly encourage the clinical application of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as novel therapeutic agents against these cancers in dogs. ",

Importantly, the PD-1 gene-edited TIL product showed improved in vitro effector function and a significantly increased polyfunctional cytokine profile (TNFα, GM-CSF, and IFNγ) compared to unmodified TIL in two of the three donors tested. In addition, all donor cells displayed an effector memory phenotype and expanded approximately 500-2,000-fold in vitro.

For comparison, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from matched melanoma patients. We sorted different CD8(+) subsets found in TIL and determined their effector functions. In addition, we carried out Vβ clonotype expression analysis of T-cell receptors to determine lineage relationship between the CD8(+) TIL subsets.;The majority of CD8(+) TIL was in the early-effector memory stage of differentiation. A significant population consisted of an oligoclonal subset of cells coexpressing CD27, CD28, CD57, and Granzyme B, with little or no perforin.

Addition of TGF-β1 prevented further differentiation.;Our studies identified a novel subset of incompletely differentiated CD8(+) CTL coexpressing early effector memory and late CTL markers.

Some of the highest clinical response rates for metastatic melanoma have been reported in trials using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). These protocols still have room for improvement and furthermore are currently only performed at a limited number of institutions. The goal of this work was to develop TILs as a therapeutic product at our institution.;TILs from 40 melanoma tissue specimens were expanded and characterized. Under optimized culture conditions, 72% of specimens yielded rapidly proliferating TILs as defined as at least one culture reaching ≥3×10(7) TILs within 4 weeks. Flow cytometric analyses showed that cultures were predominantly CD3+ T cells, with highly variable CD4+:CD8+ T cell ratios. In total, 148 independent bulk TIL cultures were assayed for tumor reactivity. Thirty-four percent (50/148) exhibited tumor reactivity based on IFN-γ production and/or cytotoxic activity. Thirteen percent (19/148) showed specific cytotoxic activity but not IFN-γ production and only 1% (2/148) showed specific IFN-γ production but not cytotoxic activity. Further expansion of TILs using a 14-day \"rapid expansion protocol\" (REP) is required to induce a 500- to 2000-fold expansion of TILs in order to generate sufficient numbers of cells for current ACT protocols. Thirty-eight consecutive test REPs were performed with an average 1865-fold expansion (+/- 1034-fold) after 14 days.;TILs generally expanded efficiently and tumor reactivity could be detected in vitro.

Age groups were defined as ≤45 (young), 46-65 (intermediate), and >65 (older). Each age group in the IMCG and TCGA cohorts was stratified by tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) measurements and tested for association with MSS. Differential expression of 594 immunoregulatory genes was assessed in a subset of primary melanomas in the IMCG and TCGA cohorts using an integrative pathway analysis.;We analyzed 304, 476 (SEER), 1241 (IMCG), and 292 (TCGA) patients. Increasing age at melanoma diagnosis in both the SEER and IMCG cohorts demonstrated a positive correlation with tumor thickness, ulceration, stage, and mortality, however age in the TCGA cohort did not correlate with mortality. Older age was associated with shorter MSS in all three cohorts. When the young age group in both the IMCG and TCGA cohorts was stratified by TIL status, there were no differences in MSS. However, older IMCG patients with brisk TILs and intermediate aged TCGA patients with high lymphocyte scores (3-6) had improved MSS.

The antigens identified in mouse model systems appear, with one exception, to represent the products of mutated genes. In contrast, most of the antigens recognized by human tumor-reactive T cells reported to date appear to represent the products of non-mutated genes. Here we report the isolation of a cDNA clone encoding beta-catenin, which was shown to be recognized by the tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) 1290, a HLA-A24 restricted melanoma-specific CTL line from patient 888. The cDNA clone, which was isolated from the autologous melanoma cDNA library, differed by a single base pair from the published beta-catenin sequence, resulting in a change from a serine to a phenylalanine residue at position 37. Normal tissues from this patient did not express the altered sequence, nor did 12 allogeneic melanomas, indicating that this represented a unique mutation in this patient's melanoma. A peptide corresponding to the sequence between amino acids 29 and 37 of the mutant gene product was identified as the T cell epitope recognized by TIL 1290. The observation that HLA-A24 binding peptides contain an aromatic or hydrophobic residue at position 9 suggested that the change at position 37 may have generated a peptide (SYLDSGIHF) which was capable of binding to HLA-A24, and a competitive binding assay confirmed this hypothesis. The beta-catenin protein has been shown previously to be involved in cell adhesion mediated through the cadherin family of cell surface adhesion molecules. The high frequency of mutations found in members of cellular adhesion complexes in a variety of cancers suggests that these molecules may play a role in development of the malignant phenotype.",

The cells capable of mediating tumor regression consisted of heterogeneous lymphocyte populations with high avidity for tumor antigens that were derived from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes cultured for limited times in vitro. The success of this treatment likely results from the ability to infuse large numbers of activated antitumor lymphocytes into an appropriate host homeostatic environment depleted of regulatory T cells. These studies are elucidating the requirements for successful immunotherapy of patients with advanced metastatic disease and are leading to additional clinical trials with gene-modified lymphocytes.",

Available data suggest that these observations contrast with those made for other HLA-A*0201-presented melanoma self antigens regarding the regularity of observed CTL responses. Based on preliminary findings, we hypothesized that the CTL response to MART-1 might be augmented in part by T cell encounters with peptides derived from sources other than MART-1, which show sequence similarity to MART-1(27-35). To test this idea, a protein database search for potential MART-1 epitope mimics was done using criteria developed from analyses of effector recognition of singly-substituted peptide analogues of MART-1(27-35). Synthetic peptides were made for a portion of the sequences retrieved; 12/40 peptides tested were able to sensitize target cells for lysis by one or more anti-MART-1 effectors. The peptides recognized correspond to sequences occurring in a variety of proteins of viral, bacterial, and human (self) origin. One peptide derives from glycoprotein C of the common pathogen HSV-1; cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus encoding native glycoprotein C were lysed by anti-MART-1 effectors. Our results overall indicate that sequences conforming to the A2.1 binding motif and possessing features essential to recognition by anti-MART-1 CTL occur frequently in proteins. These findings further suggest that T cells might encounter a variety of such sequences in vivo, and that epitope mimicry may play a role in modulating the CTL response to MART-1(27-35).",

Multiple indirect arguments have supported the view that the immune system may control, at least in certain cases, malignant cell growth while direct demonstration is still lacking in the human. In an attempt to address this issue, we have selected a study model, namely spontaneously regressive melanoma. In previous series of experiments, the variability of T cell receptors (TCRs) in the lymphocytes infiltrating a regressive tumor lesion was investigated. Results demonstrated that clonal T cell populations, precisely defined through their V-D-J junctional sequences, were amplified in situ. One clone was predominant, expressing the V beta 16 variable gene segment. A specific anti-V beta 16 TCR mAb was generated here to purify and functionally characterize the corresponding cells. A tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte-derived V beta 16+ T cell line was developed using this reagent. These in vitro cultured cells were found to express the in vivo predominant TCR sequence exclusively and to display an HLA-B14-restricted cytotoxic activity against the autologous tumor cells. Immunohistochemical experiments, performed with the anti-V beta 16 mAb, showed that the corresponding CTLs are present in the tumor area, some of them being closely opposed to the melanoma cells. Together, these studies demonstrate the existence of a local adaptive immune response clinically associated to tumor regression, thus strongly supporting the validity of the immunosurveillance concept in certain human tumors.",

The responsiveness of some patients with metastatic melanoma to treatment with the prototypic T-cell growth factor (TCGF), interleukin-2 (IL-2), indicates that T cells play a role in antitumor immunity. Interleukin-4 (IL-4), another TCGF that has been administered clinically to humans, was not associated with tumor response in our trials conducted at the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute. Combination trials of IL-2 with IL-4 have shown no increase in responsiveness of melanoma or other tumors when compared to IL-2 alone. However, enhanced expansion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in vitro has been observed with combinations of low-dose IL-2 and IL-4. We have begun a study evaluating the trafficking of such expanded lymphocytes following their adoptive transfer in association with systemic administration of IL-2 and IL-4. We have established several TIL cultures from fresh tumor samples, maintained them in long-term culture, and marked them with the neomycin phosphotransferase gene using the LNL6 retroviral vector. Such TILs appear to demonstrate no notable alterations in phenotype or cytolytic activity when compared to their nontransduced counterparts. In addition to IL-2 and IL-4, there are a variety of other novel TCGFs that are now available for evaluation in preclinical and clinical trials.

Moreover, in vitro culture steps may introduce major biases. New approaches to identify tumor-specific CTL clones would be helpful. As a means to describe the in situ immune status by T-cell repertoire analysis, we developed the Immunoscope approach, a PCR-based method that allows us to determine the spectra of CDR3 lengths of the TCR chains displayed by complex populations of T cells. We review here some of our data about melanoma. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of a melanoma patient were analyzed by different means and melanoma-specific T-cell clones were derived. Two categories of tumor-specific CD8+ CTL clones were derived from the infiltrate of a tumor-proximal invaded lymph node. The majority of T-cell clones specifically lyse the autologous tumor cell lines and predominantly recognize the HLA-A2/MART-1(27-35) peptide complex. The in vivo representativity of such CTL was assessed by the immunoscope technology. Among three MART-1-specific clones, none was detectable in situ. The other kind of tumor-specific CD8+ CTL did not lyse autologous melanoma cell lines but lysed the \"fresh\" autologous tumor cells in a MHC class I dependent manner. The immunoscope approach revealed that one of the latter was detectable in situ among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes although not among PBMC. These data indicate that melanoma-specific lymphocytes that could not have been selected through conventional screening procedures may be important in tumor rejection. Our results suggest that a better characterization of tumor-specific immune responses will be important for the optimization of specific immunotherapy strategies and the long-term follow-up of patients.",

The aim of this paper is to update clinical results of 7 years of follow-up after the last treated patient. In the trial conducted between December 1993 and January 1999, patients without any detectable metastases after lymph node excision were randomly assigned to receive either TIL plus interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 2 months, or IL-2 only. The duration of the relapse-free interval was the primary objective. Eighty-eight patients were enrolled in the study. Currently, the last analysis performed in June 2006, after a median follow-up of 114.8 months, did not show change of non-significant extension of the relapse-free interval or overall survival. However, this second analysis strengthens our first hypothesis about the relationship between number of invaded lymph nodes and TIL treatment effectiveness. In the group with only one invaded lymph node, the estimated relapse rate was significantly lower (P (adjusted) = 0.0219) and the overall survival was increased (P (adjusted) = 0.0125) in the TIL+IL-2 arm compared with the IL-2 only arm. No differences between the two arms, either with regard to the duration of disease-free survival (P (adjusted) = 0.38) or overall survival (P (adjusted) = 0.43), were noted in the group with more than one invaded lymph node, whatever the number of invaded lymph nodes. Treatment was compatible with normal daily activity. This study, with a very long follow up (median of almost 10 years), postulates for the first time relationship between TIL efficiency in stage III melanoma (AJCC) and number of invaded lymph nodes, indicating that tumor burden might be a crucial factor in the production of an effective in vitro expansion of T cells specific for autologous tumor antigen, a finding which could be of value in future vaccine development for the treatment of melanoma.",

The median fraction of cells that were T cells in post-vaccine tumors was 41%, as compared with 9% in pre-treatment tumors, and those T cells were predominantly CD8+ (mean CD8/CD4 ratio = 5.0).

We found that TILs isolated after the rapid expansion protocol (REP) phase, used to generate the final patient TIL infusion product, were hyporesponsive to restimulation with MART-1 peptide-pulsed dendritic cells, with many CD8(+) T cells undergoing apoptosis. Telomere length was shorter post-REP, but of sufficient length to support further cell division. Phenotypic analysis revealed that cell-surface CD28 expression was significantly reduced in post-REP TILs, whereas CD27 levels remained unchanged. Tracking post-REP TIL proliferation by CFSE dilution, as well as sorting for CD8(+)CD28(+) and CD8(+)CD28(-) post-REP subsets, revealed that the few CD28(+) TILs remaining post-REP had superior survival capacity and proliferated after restimulation with MART-1 peptide. An analysis of different supportive cytokine mixtures during the REP found that a combination of IL-15 and IL-21 facilitated comparable expansion of CD8(+) TILs as IL-2, but prevented the loss of CD28 expression with improved responsiveness to antigenic restimulation post-REP. These results suggest that current expansion protocols using IL-2 for melanoma adoptive T cell therapy yields largely CD8(+) T cells unable to persist and divide in vivo following Ag contact. The few CD8(+)CD28(+) T cells that remain may be the only CD8(+) TILs that ultimately survive to repopulate the host and mediate long-term tumor control.

In the present study, we investigated the feasibility of transducing human tumor cells with genes coding for gamma-interferon (IFN gamma) or alpha-interferon (IFN alpha), which are two other cytokines that can enhance host antitumor immune responses. Tumor cells from 12 melanoma and 2 renal cell carcinoma patients were transduced with retroviral vectors containing the gene for IFN gamma. Northern blot analysis showed IFN gamma transcripts only in the IFN gamma gene-transduced cells. In both IFN gamma-secreting and non-secreting tumor lines, the cell surface expression of HLA class I and class II molecules increased following transduction. However, the magnitude of the increase in HLA expression appeared to be greater in tumor lines secreting IFN gamma. Two melanoma cell lines were successfully transduced with an IFN alpha retroviral vector. Melanoma cells transduced with the IFN alpha gene contained IFN alpha RNA transcripts and secreted large amounts of IFN alpha. In contrast to cells transduced with the IFN gamma gene, the expression of HLA class II molecules was not increased in the IFN alpha gene-transduced cells. Finally, we tested the ability of HLA.DR+ melanoma cells, which had been transduced with the IFN gamma gene, to stimulate specific cytokine release by autologous CD4+ TIL. Specific secretion of cytokine by TIL occurred when the TIL and IFN gamma gene-transduced tumor cells were cultured together but not when TIL were cultured alone or with control nontransduced tumor cells. These results suggest that molecules newly expressed on the transduced cells promoted antigen presentation and T-cell responses against the transduced tumor cells. The insertion of the IFN gamma gene into melanoma cells may be useful either for active immunization against melanoma or for the generation of TIL to be used in adoptive immunotherapy.",

Uncultured TIL produced interferon gamma (IFN gamma), but not interleukin-2 (IL-2) or IL-4, in response to anti-CD3 mAb or IL-2. In bulk cultures, IL-2-activated TIL displaying autologous tumor-specific cytotoxicity (CTL-TIL) produced IFN gamma in culture with medium alone, whereas IL-2-activated noncytotoxic TIL did not. Addition of anti-CD3 mAb or autologous tumor cells up-regulated IFN gamma production in IL-2-activated TIL from 10 of 12 or 6 of 12 cases respectively. Those from 4 of 12 cases (2 CTL-TIL and 2 noncytotoxic TIL) produced IL-2 in culture with medium alone. At the clonal level, 5 (4 CD4+ and 1 CD8+) of 7 autologous tumor-specific CTL clones derived from TIL and 3 (2 CD4+ and 1 CD8+) of 7 noncytotoxic TIL clones produced IFN gamma in culture with medium alone, which was up-regulated by adding anti-CD3 mAb. Two IFN gamma-producing CTL clones tested produced IL-2 in 4x-concentrated supernatants from a 3.5-h culture with medium alone. Furthermore, 2 IFN gamma-producing CTL clones tested expressed mRNA for both IFN gamma and IL-2. IL-2 production and its mRNA expression were up- or down-regulated, respectively, by adding anti-CD3 mAb or autologous tumor cells. IL-4 production was not observed in culture either with medium alone or with IL-2 in any of the cells described above. Anti-CD3 mAb was required for IL-4 production in 3 of 12 IL-2-activated TIL, 2 of 6 CTL clones, and none of 5 noncytotoxic TIL clones. In summary, IFN gamma production was characteristic of melanoma TIL. Some autologous tumor-specific CTL in TIL are suggested to be productive of IL-2 and IFN gamma under unstimulated conditions, both being required for self-activation in an autocrine loop.",

TIL therapy itself has little side effects, but conditioning chemo- or radiotherapy and postinfusion interleukin 2 (IL-2) injections are associated with severe adverse advents. We reasoned that combining TIL infusion with dendritic cell (DC) vaccination could circumvent the need for conditioning and IL-2 support and thus represent a milder treatment approach. Eight patients with stage IV melanoma were enrolled in the MAT01 study, consisting of vaccination with autologous tumor-lysate-loaded DC, followed by TIL infusion. Six of eight patients were treated according to protocol, while one patient received only TIL and one only DC. Treatments were well tolerated with a single grade 3 adverse event. The small study size precludes analysis of clinical responses, though interestingly one patient showed a complete remission and two had stable disease. Analysis of the infusion products revealed that mature DC were generated in all cases. TIL after expansion were CD3+ T cells, dominated by effector memory CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Analysis of the T cell receptor repertoire revealed presence of highly dominant clones in most infusion products, and many of these could be detected in the circulation for weeks after T cell transfer. Here, we report the first combination of DC vaccination and TIL infusion in malignant melanoma. This combined treatment was safe and feasible, though after evaluating both clinical and immunological parameters, we expect that administration of lymphodepleting chemotherapy and IL-2 will likely increase treatment efficacy.",

Noninvasive criteria for diagnosis included newly elevated creatinine levels, new-onset hypertension, new-onset anemia, microscopic hematuria, thrombocytopenia, low haptoglobin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase values. Once diagnosed, patients were managed with control of their hypertension with multiple agents and supportive red blood cell transfusions. TMA typically stabilized or improved and no patient progressed to dialysis.

However, theoretically it should be of greater benefit as adjuvant therapy, especially in high-risk stages (resected stages III and IV). In a preliminary study, 25 patients (aged 23-72 years) with stage III-IV melanoma who underwent resection of metachronous metastases were reinfused with TIL cultivated and expanded in vitro with IL-2 from surgically removed metastases. IL-2 (starting dose 12 x 10 IU/m ) was co-administered as a continuous infusion according to West's scheme. A total of 8/22 (36.3%) evaluable patients were disease-free (DF) at a median follow-up of 5 years. DF survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 44% and 37%, respectively, at 2 years, and 52% and 45% at 3 years. The CNS was the only site of disease recurrence in 57% of patients who relapsed. DF patients received a higher median dose of IL-2 than those who progressed (total dose 110 x 10 versus 86 x 10 IU/m, respectively). The progressive reduction in IL-2 dosage allowed all patients to complete treatment without permanent grade 4 toxicity. Analysis of tumor immunosuppression factors in lymphocytes inside the tumor (TCR zeta and epsilon chains, p56, FAS, and FAS-ligand) confirmed that the immunologic potential of TIL, depressed at the time of metastasectomy, was significantly restored after in vitro culture with IL-2. Adoptive immunotherapy with TIL and IL-2 could improve DFS and OS, although further work is required to determine its role in the treatment of patients with high-risk melanoma.",

This clone, which represented three of eight independently derived clones from a tumor deposit on the skin of the abdomen, also represented two of eight clones derived from a skin lesion on the shoulder. This clone could be identified by its use of a unique TCRBV2-nD1n-J1S6 sequence, and could also be detected by single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) as the dominant TCRBV2-expressing clone among CD8+ TILs propagated from both shoulder and abdominal lesions. Using SSCP analysis, we also demonstrated that this clone was dominant in the fresh tumor tissue and in all TILs in which CD8+ were strongly represented, including several separate but parallel cultures. The SSCP pattern for this clone was not apparent among CD4+ TILs or CD8+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The SSCP analysis of the tumor tissue prior to in vitro culture is an indication that the selection for this anti-tumor cytotoxic T cell clone was a reflection of its in vivo accumulation. Thus, we provide evidence that melanomas are immunogenic and able to select for cytotoxic antitumor-specific TIL clones that are expanded in vivo and can circulate to accumulate in different tumor sites. However, because these clones were isolated from progressing tumor metastases, the accumulation of these specific cytotoxic T cells was not sufficient to contain tumor growth.",

TIL from five of seven cases proliferated well in culture with AIM-V serum-free medium and 1000 U/ml rIL-2 in 3-L gas permeable bags, whereas TIL from two RCCs exhibited delayed proliferation. Proliferation of CD3-CD56+ NK cells with major histocompatibility complex-nonrestricted cytotoxicity in RCC-TIL (n = 6, mean = 651-fold, ranging from 39- to 3450-fold) for the first 2-4 weeks was 63 times higher than that of noncytotoxic CD3+ T cells (n = 6, 10.3-fold ranging from 0.8 to 35-fold). Thereafter, CD3+ T cells predominantly proliferated, and proliferation of CD3+ T cells (n = 5, 743-fold) for 5-6 weeks were 24 times higher than that of CD3-CD56+ NK cells (n = 5, 31-fold). Significant numbers of RCC-TIL became adherent to the surfaces of the bags several weeks after initiation of culture. These adherent TIL consisted of more CD3-CD56+ NK cells and exhibited higher cytotoxicity than did nonadherent TIL. Adherent RCC-TIL produced interferon (IFN)-gamma, while nonadherent TIL did not. These results suggest that initially cytotoxic CD3-CD56+ NK cells and, later, noncytotoxic CD3+ T cells proliferated in culture of RCC-TIL for adoptive therapy. These noncytotoxic TIL were primarily transferred to RCC patients, who also received cyclophosphamide, IL-2, and IFN-alpha. In contrast to RCC-TIL, IL-2-activated melanoma TIL consisting of all CD3+ T cells displayed modest levels of cytotoxicity, primarily restricted to autologous melanoma cells in all cases tested.

Durable complete response rates of 20% to 25% are achieved in patients with metastatic melanoma following adoptive cell transfer of T cells derived from metastatic lesions, responses that appear in some patients to be mediated by T cells that predominantly recognize mutated antigens. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the reactivity of T cells administered to a patient with metastatic melanoma who exhibited a complete response for over 3 years after treatment. Over 4,000 nonsynonymous somatic mutations were identified by whole-exome sequence analysis of the patient's autologous normal and tumor cell DNA. Autologous B cells transfected with 720 mutated minigenes corresponding to the most highly expressed tumor cell transcripts were then analyzed for their ability to stimulate the administered T cells. Autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes recognized 10 distinct mutated gene products, but not the corresponding wild-type products, each of which was recognized in the context of one of three different MHC class I restriction elements expressed by the patient. Detailed clonal analysis revealed that 9 of the top 20 most prevalent clones present in the infused T cells, comprising approximately 24% of the total cells, recognized mutated antigens. Thus, we have identified and enriched mutation-reactive T cells and suggest that such analyses may lead to the development of more effective therapies for the treatment of patients with metastatic cancer.

However, compared with results obtained by infusion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, the response rate observed in this first TCR gene therapy trial is low. One strategy that is likely to enhance the success rate of TCR gene therapy is the use of tumor-reactive TCRs with a higher capacity for tumor cell recognition. We therefore sought to develop standardized procedures for the selection of well-expressed, high-affinity, and safe human TCRs. Here we show that TCR surface expression can be improved by modification of TCR alpha and beta sequences and that such improvement has a marked effect on the in vivo function of TCR gene-modified T cells.

Prognostic factors within this group, however, have not been well characterized.;We performed a retrospective analysis of 1,621 patients undergoing sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy at our institution (1996-2011) to compare patients with (n = 98) and patients without (n = 1,523) microsatellites. Univariate and multivariate logistic and Cox regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with SLN positivity and melanoma-specific survival (MSS) in patients with microsatellites.;Patients with microsatellites were older and had lesions with higher Clark level and greater thickness that more frequently had mitoses, ulceration, and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (all p < 0.0001). In microsatellite patients, the SLN positivity rate was 43 %. Lesional ulceration (odds ratio [OR] = 2.9, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.5-8.6), absent tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (OR = 2.8, 95 % CI 1.1-7.1), and LVI (OR = 3.3, 95 % CI 1.7-10) were significantly associated with SLN positivity by multivariate analysis. With a median follow-up of 4.5 years in survivors, ulceration (hazards ratio [HR] = 3.4, 95 % CI 1.5-7.8) and >1 metastatic LN (HR = 2.7, 95 % CI 1.1-6.6) were significantly associated with decreased MSS by multivariate analysis. In patients without these prognostic factors, the 5-year MSS was 90 % (n = 49) compared with 50 % (n = 23) among patients with ulceration only, 51 % (n = 12) in those with >1 metastatic LN only, or 25 % in those with both (n = 14, p < 0.01).;Microsatellitosis was frequently associated with multiple adverse pathologic features.

BRAFi-treated patients showed significant increases in CD4(+), CD8(+), and PD-1(+) lymphocytes from PRE to EDT (P = 0.001, P = 0.001, P = 0.017, respectively), and Combi-treated patients showed similar increases in CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes from PRE to EDT (P = 0.017, P = 0.021).;The addition of MEKi to BRAFi did not result in significant reduction in immune infiltration in EDT biopsies. This provides support for conducting trials that combine MAPKi with immune checkpoint inhibitors in the hope of improving complete and durable response rates.

Two clones from a single patient were sequenced and detected in three different tumor sites (skin biopsies), whereas only one of them was also present in peripheral blood. Biopsies from this patient did not show major repertoire changes during in vivo IL-2 treatment. In contrast, in biopsies from a second patient, the expression of all the detected V beta subfamilies was increased and a larger number of clones expanded, probably as a result of therapy. A similar evolution was found among infiltrating T cells cultured in vitro from a third patient for several weeks in the presence of IL-2, where the largely polyclonal repertoire of fresh T cells (from invaded lymph nodes) was dramatically reduced to mainly clonal expansions in all V beta subfamilies detected. The high resolution method used here enables a rapid, comprehensive, qualitative, and semiquantitative description of the T cell repertoire of heterogeneous cell populations. Its use in conjunction with a functional analysis of clones detected within these populations should provide a better understanding of the evolution of the T cell repertoire among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes during the progression of the disease and as a response to immunotherapy.",

In this study, biochemical protein purification methods were used in conjunction with novel mass spectrometry sequencing techniques and molecular cloning to isolate a unique melanoma Ag recognized by a CD4(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) line. The HLA-DRbeta1*0101-restricted Ag was determined to be a mutated glycolytic enzyme, triosephosphate isomerase (TPI). A C to T mutation identified by cDNA sequencing caused a Thr to Ile conversion in TPI, which could be detected in a tryptic digest of tumor-derived TPI by mass spectrometry. The Thr to Ile conversion created a neoepitope whose T cell stimulatory activity was enhanced at least 5 logs compared with the wild-type peptide. Analysis of T cell recognition of serially truncated peptides suggested that the mutated amino acid residue was a T cell receptor contact.

These culture conditions did not select for a particular T cell subset. Using these culture conditions, we report here the generation of 66 CD4+ and 36 CD8+ TIL clones from five patients with melanoma. Eighty-five percent of the CD4+ TIL clones were not cytolytic (< 30% lysis, E:T 20:1) as determined by antibody-redirected lysis (ARL), whereas all CD8+ clones showed strong ARL activity (> 30% lysis). Clones were further tested for production of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma after activation for 48 hr by solid-phase anti-CD3. CD8+ clones produced significant amounts of IFN-gamma, little IL-2, and no IL-4. CD4+ clones were classified as Th0, Th1, or Th2, analogous to the classification of T helper cells in the mouse. Sixty-six percent existed as Th0, producing IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma. Only 15% existed as Th1, producing IL-2 and IFN-gamma, and 19% as Th2, producing IL-4 but no IL-2 or IFN-gamma. In all cases, unstimulated clones or clones stimulated with the allogeneic B cell line did not produce detectable amounts of cytokines. Solid-phase anti-CD3 activation was compared to activation with autologous melanoma cells. Five of nine CD8+ clones produced low amounts of IL-2 (< 200 pg/ml/10(6) cells) in response to autologous tumor, but none of the CD8 clones produced IFN-gamma or IL-4. Also, 5/7 Th0 clones from one patient produced similar amounts of IL-2 after stimulation with anti-CD3 or autologous tumor. The other two clones produced only 10% or less of the amount produced in response to anti-CD3. No IL-4 or IFN-gamma could be detected in response to autologous tumor. In contrast, none of the 12 T helper clones from two other patients produced any cytokines after stimulation with autologous tumor cells. Together these data suggest that the T cell infiltrate in melanoma consists primarily of IL-2-producing Th0 cells, but few of those are triggered by autologous tumor cells.",

A major limitation of ACT is the inability to generate or expand autologous tumor-reactive TIL in 25-45 % of patients tested. Methods that successfully identify tumors that are not suitable for TIL generation by standard methods would eliminate the costs of fruitless expansion and enable these patients to receive alternate therapy immediately.;Multispectral fluorescent immunohistochemistry with a panel including CD3, CD8, FoxP3, CD163, PD-L1 was used to analyze the tumor microenvironment in 17 patients with melanoma among our 36-patient cohort to predict successful TIL generation. Additionally, we compared tumor fragments and enzymatic digestion of tumor samples for efficiency in generating tumor-reactive TIL.;Tumor-reactive TIL were generated from 21/36 (58 %) of melanomas and for 12/13 (92 %) tumors where both enzymatic and fragment methods were compared. TIL generation was successful in 10/13 enzymatic preparations and in 10/13 fragment cultures; combination of both methods resulted in successful generation of autologous tumor-reactive TIL in 12/13 patients. In 17 patients for whom tissue blocks were available, IHC analysis identified that while the presence of CD8(+) T cells alone was insufficient to predict successful TIL generation, the CD8(+) to FoxP3(+) ratio was predictive with a positive-predictive value (PPV) of 91 % and negative-predictive value (NPV) of 86 %. Incorporation of CD163+ macrophage numbers and CD8:PD-L1 ratio did not improve the PPV. However, the NPV could be improved to 100 % by including the ratio of CD8(+):PD-L1(+) expressing cells.;This is the first study to apply 7-color multispectral immunohistochemistry to analyze the immune environment of tumors from patients with melanoma. Assessment of the data using unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified tumors from which we were unable to generate TIL. If substantiated, this immune profile could be applied to select patients for TIL generation. Additionally, this biomarker profile may also indicate a pre-existing immune response, and serve as a predictive biomarker of patients who will respond to checkpoint blockade. We postulate that expanding the spectrum of inhibitory cells and molecules assessed using this technique could guide combination immunotherapy treatments and improve response rates.",

Barcode-labeled pMHC multimers enable the combination of functional T-cell analysis with large-scale epitope recognition profiling for the characterization of T-cell recognition in various diseases, including in small clinical samples.",

One issue, however, is whether such cells actually migrate to sites of tumor after intravenous infusion. There have been several reports of tumor uptake of radiolabeled TIL in patients with metastatic melanoma, but efforts to visualize tumor with radiolabeled TIL in other tumor types reportedly have been unsuccessful.;Eight patients with metastatic cancer (5 renal, 2 melanoma, 1 colon) received an intravenous infusion of 2 to 100 billion autologous TIL, including 50 million TIL which had been conjugated to 500 microCi Indium-111, co-administered with interleukin-2 (IL-2). One patient received 1 gm/m2 of cyclophosphamide one day prior to TIL; seven patients received interferon alpha 2b for 4 days prior to receiving TIL. Total body gamma camera imaging, including single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), was performed at 24 and 48 hours.;All eight patients had demonstrable uptake of 111-Indium-labeled TIL into one or more known sites of tumor. There were no known sites of tumor which were not imaged. Metastatic sites imaged included bone, brain, mediastinal and perihilar lymph nodes, lung and liver parenchyma, abdominal periaortic nodes, and a pelvic mass. One patient served as a negative control in that the TIL scan was negative at a time when she had no evident disease, but a few weeks later had a positive TIL scan which lead to a diagnosis of axillary recurrence.;Uptake of radiolabeled TIL, whether CD8+ or CD4+, by metastatic renal cell carcinoma and other carcinomas was similar to that previously reported in melanoma. Pretreatment with cyclophosphamide was not a prerequisite for imaging, and TIL uptake did not predict tumor response.",

Hence, melanoma nodules were directly injected with a vector encoding an allogeneic MHC class I molecule, HLA-B7. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were isolated from cutaneous melanoma biopsies before and after HLA-B7 gene transfer. TIL were expanded in interleukin-2 (IL-2) by standard techniques for approximately 4 weeks, then analyzed for T cell receptor V beta usage by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Prior to gene transfer. TIL V beta usage was found to be highly restricted, the only one to four V beta families being expressed and one or two of these families representing more than 90% of the repertoire. As anticipated, TIL V beta usage varied among patients expressing different HLA types. However, V beta 13 was over-represented in that six of eight patients utilized V beta 13 as a dominant family, regardless of HLA type. Following HLA-B7 gene transfer, TIL V beta usage was markedly altered: (1) V beta families that dominated following gene transfer differed from the V beta families utilized by TIL prior to treatment, and (2) introduction of the HLA-B7 gene resulted in a more diverse repertoire with an increase in the number of V beta families represented. In two patients, TIL were evaluated before treatment and from multiple, distinct melanoma nodules following gene transfer. In these two patients, a comparison was made between TIL V beta profiles obtained after treatment from nodules that had been injected with the HLA-B7 gene or left untreated. Interestingly, the V beta repertoires of TIL from uninjected nodules following gene transfer were similar to that of TIL from injected nodules, rather than pretreatment TIL. These data demonstrate a direct immunological effect of foreign MHC gene transfer into human melanoma, and suggest that local expression of an allogeneic MHC molecule generates systemic alterations in the antitumor immune response.",

Treatment variables such as the cumulative IL-2 dose and concomitant administration of cyclophosphamide or interferon (IFN)-alpha were not predictive of response, although responders received 33% more TIL. However, statistically significant differences in favor of clinical response were noted for extranodal source of TIL (v lymph node), shorter culture duration (mean, 38 v 47 days), shorter TIL doubling time (2.6 v 3.7 days), greater autologous tumor lysis by TIL (30% v 15%; effector-to-target [E:T], 40:1), and secretion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by TIL following autologous tumor stimulation (six of nine responders v eight of 32 nonresponders).;The associations of TIL lysis of autologous tumor and younger TIL age with clinical response observed in this study are supportive of previous reports, and these findings will be useful in designing future clinical trials.

In vitro, these transduced TILs secreted IL-2 while retaining tumor specificity and exhibited prolonged survival after IL-2 withdrawal. In a phase I/II clinical trial, seven evaluable patients received transduced TILs and one patient experienced a partial response associated with in vivo persistence of IL-2-transduced TILs in circulating lymphocytes. An additional five patients received transduced TILs in conjunction with IL-2 administration. Persistence of IL-2-transduced TILs was observed in three patients, including one partial responder. The transgene DNA as well as vector-derived IL2 mRNA could be detected for 4 months in responding patients. The low response rate in this trial was possibly due to a reduction in telomere length in cells as a result of prolonged in vitro culture.

From May 1993 through February 1994, 20 patients were treated with 24 courses of IFN-gamma with or without IL-2. A 7-day course of subcutaneous IFN-gamma alone was administered to cohorts of two or three patients each at doses of 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 mg/m2. Thirteen patients received escalating doses of IFN-gamma between 0.2 and 0.5 mg/m2 followed by the intravenous (i.v.) administration of IL-2 (720,000 IU/kg) given three times a day. A treatment course consisted of two cycles (maximum of 15 doses of IL-2 per cycle) separated by a 10-day interval. Five additional patients were treated with five courses of IFN-gamma, IL-2, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). All patients treated had the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. The maximal tolerated dose of subcutaneous IFN-gamma was established at 0.3 mg/m2 with dose-limiting hepatotoxicity. Immunohistochemistry analyses showed detectable upregulation of MHC class I alleles in one (8%) of 12 patients. Two of 20 patients who received the combination of IFN-gamma and IL-2 had responses, one partial and one complete response. The duration of response was 7 months for the partial response and 12 months for the complete response. IFN-gamma was tolerated with minimal side effects of nausea, vomiting, malaise, and decreased hematopoiesis. No increased toxicities were found with the combination treatment, as compared with IL-2 alone. One death occurred on the third day of treatment with IFN-gamma alone from hemorrhage into brain metastases. There were no responders in the five patients who received the combination treatment of TIL, IL-2, and IFN-gamma. From these findings, we conclude that further studies looking at this combination treatment are not warranted.",

All published cases of DNM to date were reviewed. Paraffin sections from 26 cases were investigated with a panel of 10 tissue markers. The ultrastructural features of seven cases were evaluated.;A comparison of this study's findings with that of other published cases revealed many similarities regarding clinical and pathologic findings and outcome. The patients were white (15 men:13 women; mean and median age, 59 years; range, 22-83 years). Most tumors were located on the head and neck (75%) and were nonpigmented (57%). An associated intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation was identified in 85% of the patients (lentigo maligna in 56%). Histologically, the dermal tumors were composed of tapered, nonpigmented spindle cells in peripheral nerve sheath patterns resembling neuromas, schwannomas, neurofibromas, and perineurial proliferations accompanied by variable neurotropism and desmoplasia; desmoplasia was the most notable feature in most tumors. The mean depth of tumor invasion was 4.1 mm (range, 0.32-9.0 mm). Tumors with continuity between the epidermal and dermal components had a significantly thinner depth of invasion and a more extensive intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation than those tumors with a grenz zone between the two components (2.3 mm vs. 4.6 mm, P = 0.015). Mitotic activity ranged from 0/HPF in 10 cases, 1-6/high power field (HPF) in 12 cases, and to greater than 6/HPF in 4 cases. An ulcer was present in 5/27 tumors, regression in 4/27, a microsatellite in 1, and brisk and had nonbrisk tumor infiltrating lymphocytic responses in 2 and 14, respectively. Vimentin was uniformly positive and keratins AE1.3 and Cam 5.2 and Leu-7 were uniformly negative. S100 protein, also uniformly positive, had patchy reactivity in most tumors that expressed EMA (43%). Smooth muscle actin (52%), neuron-specific enolase (42%), and FXIIIa (30%) had patchy positivity. HMB-45 was reactive only in the epidermal and superficial papillary dermal component in 21% of cases. Ultrastructurally, the common features were long, often intertwining cellular processes, intercellular junctions, and discontinuous basal lamina. Melanosomes were not identified. Follow-up data available on 26/28 patients (mean, 36 months; median, 24 months; range, 5-132 months) showed 20 (70%) alive without disease, 2 alive with disease and 3 dead from disease. Seven patients had recurrent local tumor (multiple in four); four had lymph node metastases, and three had visceral metastases. Patients with recurrent disease of any type had significantly thicker tumors (5.4 mm vs. 3.4 mm, P = 0.046) and were more likely to have an ulcerated tumor (P = 0.03). Actuarial 5-year survival for tumors with greater than a 4-mm thickness was 72%, which was greater than that for other types of melanoma with greater than a 4-mm thickness.;Desmoplastic neurotropic melanomas are neuroectodermal tumors that usually arise from an intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation but rarely develop de novo in the dermis. Schwannian and perineurial differentiation may account for the desmoplasia and neurotropism encountered in these neoplasms. Desmoplastic neurotropic melanomas present at a more advanced stage locally and may be associated with a better survival than associated with conventional melanomas of similar depth of invasion.",

T-cell recognition of naturally processed MHC class I-presented peptides, or alternatively synthetic peptides derived from MAGE-1 or MAGE-3, leads to cytokine release as well as to a cytotoxic T-cell response in these antimelanoma-directed polyclonal or clonal effector T-cell populations. Recent reports suggest that the activity of T lymphocytes infiltrating melanoma in vivo appears to be impaired. We report here the characterization of the in vitro (in the presence of 6000 IU interleukin 2) expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) T-cell line PM2-B2 derived from a patient with rapidly progressing and therapy-resistant head and neck melanoma. The TIL cell line PM2-B2 did not lyse, but instead released granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in response to the autologous tumor or HLA-A1-matched allogeneic tumor cell lines. The TIL line PM2-B2 did not kill the MHC class I natural killer/lymphokine-activated killer target cell lines Daudi or K562. The fine specificity of the TIL line PM2-B2 restricted by HLA-A1 was further characterized by evaluating specific granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor release in response to MHC class I-eluted peptides derived from HLA-A1(+) melanoma cell lines. TIL PM2-B2 failed to recognize the recently described HLA-A1-presented peptides derived from the gene products encoded by MAGE-1 or MAGE-3. PCR-based analysis of the freshly harvested tumor from patient PM2-B2 revealed the presence of message for the melanoma-associated gene products MAGE-1 and MAGE-3, but not for tyrosinase or MART-1/MELAN-A. Acid elution and high performance liquid chromatography fractionation of MHC class I-presented peptides from HLA-A1-matched melanoma cell lines 397 or 888 revealed that TIL PM2-B2 recognized at least three distinct peptide epitopes eluting in high performance liquid chromatographic bioactive fractions 5/6, 36, and 51/52. These bioactive peaks appeared to be shared among HLA-A1(+) melanoma cell lines. We suggest, based on this report, that HLA-A1-presented melanoma-derived peptides (other than those previously reported peptides derived from MAGE-1 or MAGE-3) may represent targets for TIL recognition as defined by cytokine release, but not cytotoxicity. Such an immune response differentially defined by cytokine release, but absent cytotoxic functions, may either reflect the impaired cytolytic function of the TIL population or reflect the inherent nature of HLA-A1-presented melanoma T-cell epitopes leading to cytokine release, but not to a cytotoxic T-cell response. Additionally, this report suggests that the individual T-cell immune response to melanoma may be rather complex, involving diverse T-cell effector functions (e.g., cytotoxicity or cytokine release), each of which should be evaluated in studies of antitumor-specific T-cell reactivity.",

Fifty-two archival melanocytic lesions were assessed for PD-L1 expression, TIL infiltration, and BRAFmut simultaneously. IFNγ-induced PD-L1 expression in cultured melanomas was assessed in parallel according to BRAF status.

Almost all melanocytes displaying PD-L1 expression were observed to be adjacent to TILs, irrespective of BRAF status. TIL(-) lesions were not more likely to be associated with BRAFmut, when compared with TIL(+) lesions. Baseline expression of PD-L1 by melanoma cell lines was virtually nil, regardless of BRAFmut status, and the intensity of IFN-induced PD-L1 expression in melanoma cell lines likewise did not correlate with BRAF mutational status.

This peptide (AAGIGILTV) corresponds to residues 27-35 from the nonmutated melanoma-associated antigen MART-1/Melan A and is recognized by most melanoma-specific, HLA-A*0201-restricted, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. To test the in vivo induction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) sensitization, we compared CTL reactivity in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) pools obtained before and after vaccination.;MART-1(27-35) was administered to HLA-A*0201 melanoma patients subcutaneously in an emulsification with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. A vaccination course included four inoculations of peptide at 3-week intervals. PBMC collected by leukapheresis and separated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient before and after vaccination were analyzed in 18 patients by in vitro sensitization with MART-1(27-35). To induce MART-1(27-35)-specific CTL, PBMC were incubated with 1 microM peptide (on day 0) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) (300 IU/mL, on days 1 and 4 after each stimulation). At weekly intervals, cells were harvested and an aliquot was cryopreserved for later analysis. The remaining cells were replated and restimulated using irradiated autologous PBMC pulsed with 1 microM of relevant peptide. After three restimulations, all samples from one patient were tested simultaneously for HLA-A*0201-restricted anti-MART-1(27-35) reactivity by microcytotoxicity and cytokine (IFN-gamma) release assays.;Toxicities were minimal and consisted of local irritation at the site of vaccine administration. None of the patients sustained a clinical response. The first eight patients were monitored by inducing CTL reactivity from PBMC obtained preimmunization and after two and four vaccinations. Only two prevaccination cultures were reactive to MART-1, compared with five and seven cultures from PBMC obtained after two and four vaccinations, respectively. Thus, an enhancement in cytotoxic activity could be detected in postvaccination CTL cultures, and serial vaccine administrations appeared to boost the detectability of cytotoxicity in vitro. For completeness, the analysis compared prevaccination with postvaccination PBMC cultures. Specific anti-MART-1(27-35) cytotoxicity (> or = 10 lytic units) could be detected in two prevaccination and 12 postvaccination cultures after two in vitro stimulations. In 15 postvaccination CTL cultures, a more than threefold increase in specific release of IFN-gamma was noted, compared with prevaccination.;In vivo administration of a melanoma-associated antigen peptide, emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant, could safely augment CTL reactivity against epitopes commonly expressed by melanoma cells. Although the enhancement of CTL reactivity did not achieve tumor regression, it is possible that the use of recombinant immunogens with increased immunomodulatory capabilities in future clinical trials could reach the threshold of CTL activation necessary for tumor regression.",

This semiquantitative RT-PCR method could be adapted to analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded histopathological samples of primary tumor material and demonstrated to be reproducible and to be useful for the assessment of V alpha- and V beta-gene family usage in tumor samples. The TIL in primary tumors were observed to preferentially express certain TCR V alpha- and V beta-gene families: V alpha 4, and V beta 8 were highly expressed in several of the primary tumors analyzed using this method. With respect to V alpha 22 and V beta 8, the preferential expression of these V-gene families was demonstrated to be due in situ clonal expansion of T cells by means of cloning and sequencing of the CDR3 regions (V-J or V-D-J, respectively) corresponding to the RT-PCR products from one of the primary tumors. The observed preferential usage of certain TCR V alpha and V beta-genes strongly suggest the in situ clonal expansion of specific populations of T cells in accordance with recent results from others. These clonal T cell populations probably react with certain melanoma-associated peptides presented by specific HLA molecules. The preferential usage of certain V alpha- and V beta-gene families observed in several tumors further supports the involvement of a limited number of shared melanocyte or melanoma-associated peptides. Since the HLA status of the patients is obviously important to interpret these results, some of the patients were typed for HLA-A1 and -A2, the two most well-characterized restriction elements for melanoma-associated antigens, either serologically or by a newly developed RT-PCR method which similarly could by applied directly to the tumor material. In TIL in primary melanomas, a possible correlation was suggested between HLA-A2 and the preferential usage of the TCR V-gene families V alpha 4, V alpha 5, V alpha 22 and V beta 8, whereas the V beta 3-gene family appeared to be expressed together with HLA-A1. The V-gene families which were highly expressed in the primary tumors were generally not, or only very weakly, expressed in the corresponding metastases and vice versa, possibly reflecting a substantial change in the phenotype of the metastatic melanoma target cells. Continued studies of larger patient materials will be necessary to extend and validate these conclusions and of obvious interest for the further analysis of the T cell response in melanoma.",

The clinical response of the 37 targeted lesions led to an OOR of 51% and a DCR of 75%. Translational research on predictive markers did not significantly differ between responder and non-responder patients. However, specifically regarding injected lesions, the clinical response correlated with CD3-/CD56+ NK cells which could be activated by TG1042.

To further scrutinize whether similar results can be achieved with lower doses of IL2, we have carried out a phase I/II trial of TIL transfer after classical lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by an attenuated IL2 regimen.;Twenty-five patients with progressive treatment-refractory metastatic melanoma, good clinical performance, age < 70 years, and at least one resectable metastasis were eligible.

RECIST 1.0 evaluation displayed three complete responses and seven partial responses (ORR 42%). Median overall survival was 21.8 months. Tumor regression was associated with a higher absolute number of infused tumor-reactive T cells. Moreover, induction and persistence of antimelanoma T-cell responses in the peripheral blood was strongly correlated to clinical response to treatment.;TIL-ACT with a reduced IL2 decrescendo regimen results in long-lasting complete responses in patients with treatment-refractory melanoma.

Long-term follow-up of patients receiving tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for metastatic melanoma reveals a substantial subset that experienced complete, lasting tumor regression - and may be cured. Increasing evidence points to mutated gene products as the primary immunological targets of TILs from melanomas. Recent technological advances permit rapid identification of the neoepitopes resulting from these somatic gene mutations and of T cells with reactivity against these targets. Isolation and adoptive transfer of these T cells may improve TIL therapy for melanoma and permit its broader application to non-melanoma tumors. Extension of ACT to other malignancies may also be possible through antigen receptor gene engineering. Tumor regression has been observed following transfer of T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors against CD19 in B-cell malignancies or a T-cell receptor against NY-ESO-1 in synovial cell sarcoma and melanoma. Herein, we review recent clinical trials of TILs and antigen receptor gene therapy for advanced cancers.

We report here on the longitudinal immunologic workup of a melanoma patient who developed remarkably potent ex vivo detectable antimelanoma cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses after vaccinations with autologous peptide-pulsed dendritic cells. Such potent CTL responses to multiple tumor antigens have, to the best of our knowledge, not been described previously in melanoma patients, neither spontaneously nor after any therapy. This patient first experienced a transient response to therapy but finally succumbed to disease progression and died. Progression was associated with the decline of the numbers of tumor-reactive T cells in circulation and at skin metastases in addition to the loss of MHC class I antigens. The immunologic analysis revealed that fully functional tumor-specific T cells were present in the peripheral blood of this patient during the phase of a relatively stable disease, and in situ tetramer staining demonstrated that these cells were also accumulated at cutaneous and visceral tumor sites. Furthermore, comparative clonotype mapping of PBMC and TIL depicted an overlapping TCR repertoire usage among these 2 compartments. Since strong CTL responses as observed in this patient are the goal of cancer vaccination but are so far only rarely observed, the thorough analysis of patients exhibiting either exceptional clinical and/or immunologic responses appears critical to understanding how vaccine therapies work and can be further improved.",

Here, we evaluated the antitumor activity of adoptively transferred human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) genetically engineered to secrete single-chain IL12 selectively at the tumor site.;Thirty-three patients with metastatic melanoma were treated in a cell dose-escalation trial of autologous TILs transduced with a gene encoding a single-chain IL12 driven by a nuclear factor of the activated T cells promoter (NFAT.IL12). No IL2 was administered.;The administration of 0.001 to 0.1 × 10(9) NFAT.IL12-transduced TILs to 17 patients resulted in a single, objective response (5.9%). However, at doses between 0.3 and 3 × 10(9) cells, 10 of 16 patients (63%) exhibited objective clinical responses. The responses tended to be short, and the administered IL12-producing cells rarely persisted at 1 month. Increasing cell doses were associated with high serum levels of IL12 and IFNγ as well as clinical toxicities, including liver dysfunction, high fevers, and sporadic life-threatening hemodynamic instability.;In this first-in-man trial, administration of TILs transduced with an inducible IL12 gene mediated tumor responses in the absence of IL2 administration using cell doses 10- to 100-fold lower than conventional TILs. However, due to toxicities, likely attributable to the secreted IL12, further refinement will be necessary before this approach can be safely used in the treatment of cancer patients.",

We recently reported that the induction of profound unresponsiveness in a T cell clone by melanoma cells expressing MHC class II antigens may provide a mechanism for these tumor cells to escape immunosurveillance. Here we demonstrate that two T cell clones (sTC3 and sTS5) produced high amounts of IL-10 after being rendered anergic by autologous melanoma cells. Co-culture of these T cell clones with melanoma cell transfectants expressing B7, which failed to induce anergy, resulted in a significantly lower production of IL-10. IL-10 production by the anergic T cell clones correlated with an impaired ability to produce IL-2 in response to TCR mediated activation. Neutralization of IL-10 reduced the duration of T cell unresponsiveness from 14 to only 4 days, but inhibition of IL-10 production during initiation of anergy showed no effect on it. Induction of the unresponsive state, as well as the subsequent IL-10 production in sTC3 cells, could be prevented by the addition of cyclosporin A to the primary co-culture of sTC3 and the autologous melanoma. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-10 is important for maintenance of T cell anergy induced by contact with nonprofessional antigen presenting cells such as MHC class II+ melanoma cells. Furthermore, we were able to detect IL-10 in serum from melanoma patients and IL-10 mRNA in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes isolated from melanoma metastases, suggesting an in vivo relevance of our in vitro findings.",

We investigated the safety and ability to bestow gene expression via intratumoral transfer of escalating amounts of lipid-formulated plasmid DNA encoding for the MHC HLA-B7 gene product Allovectin-7 into metastatic renal cancer lesions. Fifteen patients with histologically confirmed, HLA-B7-negative metastatic renal cancer received intratumoral injection of Allovectin-7 on an escalating dose schedule. Tumors were evaluated serially by computed tomography scan, ultrasound, and physical examination. Presence of the HLA-B7 gene and protein was determined via PCR, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical staining in serial biopsy specimens. HLA-B7 gene, mRNA, or protein expression could be conclusively demonstrated in 8 of 14 patients (57%). Three patients had tumor biopsy to assess the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and all three had higher posttreatment levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. There were no significant clinical responses or toxicity at the site of injection or at other, noninjected tumor sites. This study demonstrated that intratumoral injection of Allovectin-7 is safe, feasible, and associated with minimal toxicity. This approach was capable of bestowing gene expression, possible resulting in antitumor CTL response.

This TIL was found to recognize HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitopes in tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-2 (clone MR7) and NY-ESO-1 (clone M8). These epitopes were the same as the previously identified nonapeptide TRP-2: 180-188, and the overlapping NY-ESO-1 peptides, obtained by using lymphocytes from in vitro stimulation. We also cloned a previously unknown TRP-2 mRNA isoform (TRP-2-6b) that contained two novel exons alternatively spliced from the sixth intron between exons 6 and 7 of TRP-2 mRNA. The isoform encoded an HLA-A2-restricted antigenic epitope recognized by TIL clone MB4. An immunologic analysis of the patient's PBMC obtained before treatment showed the presence of high reactivity against NY-ESO-1 and both TRP-2 Ags, but not the Ags used for immunization. Because immune response against these Ags was less pronounced, it is possible that NY-ESO-1, TRP-2, and TRP-2-6b may be of importance in the generation of CTL-mediated tumor destruction and may have played a role in the dramatic tumor regression seen in this patient.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The theory of immunosurveillance against cancer has been an extensively debated question over the last decades. Multiple indirect arguments have supported the view that the immune system may control, at least in certain cases, malignant cell growth while direct demonstration is still lacking in the human. In an attempt to address this issue, we have selected a study model, namely spontaneously regressive melanoma. A primary cutaneous lesion was investigated. T cell repertoire analysis showed the in situ amplification of at least two tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TILs) expressing the V beta 13 and V beta 16 variable TCR gene segments respectively. The two clones were precisely characterized by sequence of the TCR beta chain junctional region. Further functional study demonstrated that both lymphocytes displayed a selective cytotoxic activity against autologous tumor cells. The V beta 16+ cells, predominant in vivo, were shown to be closely opposed to the melanoma cells. Together, these studies demonstrated the existence of a local adaptative immune response associated to tumor regression, thus strongly supporting the validity of the immunosurveillance concept. A gastric metastasis which occurred three years after the primary lesion has been studied here. Overexpression of the V beta 13 and V beta 16 TCR segments was no longer detected by direct PCR analysis in situ. Sequencing transcripts from V beta 13+ and V beta 16+ TILs confirmed that the two CTLs, identified in the primary lesions, were not represented with high frequency. The V beta 13+ cell was however shown to be present while the V beta 16+ CTL was not detected. Yet, characterization of a tumor cell line derived from the gastric site indicated that the peptidic antigen(s) which induced the initially successfully immune response was still expressed. The present data illustrate that it has become possible to perform very precise analysis of local immune responses during cancer development. Such an improvement together with the recently initiated molecular characterization of tumor associated peptidic antigens, should provide the basis for improved strategies of cancer immunotherapy.",

These findings, which suggested that the proliferative potential of transferred T cells may play a role in clinical responses, led to the current studies in which telomere length as well as phenotypic markers expressed on the administered TILs were examined. TILs that were associated with objective clinical responses following adoptive transfer possessed a mean telomere length of 6.3 kb, whereas TILs that were not associated with significant clinical responses were significantly shorter, averaging 4.9 kb (p < 0.01). Furthermore, individual TIL-derived T cell clonotypes that persisted in vivo following adoptive cell transfer possessed telomeres that were longer than telomeres of T cell clonotypes that failed to persist (6.2 vs 4.5 kb, respectively; p < 0.001). Expression of the costimulatory molecule CD28 also appeared to be associated with long telomeres and T cell persistence. These results, indicating that the telomere length of transferred lymphocytes correlated with in vivo T cell persistence following adoptive transfer, and coupled with the previous observation that T cell persistence was associated with clinical responses in this adoptive immunotherapy trial, suggest that telomere length and the proliferative potential of the transferred T cells may play a significant role in mediating response to adoptive immunotherapy.",

We confirmed that this peptide is naturally presented at the surface of melanoma cells, and we showed that its processing sequentially requires translation of tyrosinase into the endoplasmic reticulum and its retrotranslocation into the cytosol, where deglycosylation of the two asparagines by peptide-N-glycanase turns them into aspartates by deamidation. This process is followed by cleavage and splicing of the appropriate fragments by the standard proteasome and additional transport of the resulting peptide into the endoplasmic reticulum through the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP).",

Patients with renal cell cancer and melanoma, who historically respond poorly to conventional therapy, have responded to therapy with recombinant interleukin-2. Recombinant interleukin-2 has been administered alone and in combination with lymphokine-activated killer cells, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and interferons alfa and beta. In addition, the effect of dosage, administration rate, dosage schedule, route of administration, and cyclophosphamide pretreatment have been investigated. The adverse effects of recombinant interleukin-2 are generally reversible but are frequently severe and dose-related. Dose-limiting adverse effects include hypotension, edema, and renal dysfunction. Since hemodynamic monitoring and supportive care are essential, recombinant interleukin-2 should be administered in a critical-care setting by trained personnel.

Twenty-one of 33 enrolled Selected-TIL patients were excluded from the protocol, mainly as cultures failed the interferon-gamma selection criteria or due to clinical deterioration, compared with only 3 Young-TIL patients. Expected bone marrow suppression and high-dose IL-2 toxicity were transient. There was no treatment-related mortality. This study vindicates the feasibility and effectiveness of TIL technology and calls for further efforts to implement and enhance this modality. The use of minimally cultured, unselected Young-TIL enables the treatment of most enrolled patients. Although the cohort of Young-TIL patients treated so far is rather small and the follow-up short, the response rate is encouraging.",

Although this therapy yields high response rates resulting in prolonged survival, the mechanisms involved remain unknown. Here, we investigated whether treatment of tumor-bearing mice with DTIC and DNCB resulted in a specific immune response against the tumor. Subcutaneous (s.c.) tumors and lung metastases were induced in C57BL/6 mice by injecting syngeneic B16-melanoma cells s.c. or into the lateral tail vein, respectively. Mice were treated with intraperitoneal injections of DTIC followed by epifocal application of DNCB. This therapeutic approach significantly reduced the growth of s.c. tumors as well as lung metastases. Our data showed that the effector mechanisms involved are dependent on T cells. No therapeutic effect was observed in immunodeficient RAG-1(-/-) mice, or when the contact sensitizer DNCB was replaced by skin irritants (croton oil or tributyltin). Splenic lymphocytes obtained from treated mice displayed a three-fold higher specific cytolytic activity against B16 cells than in tumor-bearing controls. Both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells were able to lyse B16 cells. No changes were observed in natural killer (NK) cell activity. Likewise, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) of treated mice showed higher cytolytic activity than that of controls. Analysis of cytokine expression in s.c. tumors revealed increased mRNA levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in treated tumors. Together, these findings demonstrate the ability of DTIC/DNCB treatment to induce an effective T cell-dependent host immune response against a syngeneic tumor.",

A panel of 57 different variable-region primers specific for the TCR V alpha I-29 and V beta I-28 was designed, and a semi-quantitative PCR method applicable to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues was developed. This semi-quantitative method was demonstrated to be reproducible and to be useful for the assessment of V alpha- and V beta-gene-family usage in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. A total of 9 different histopathologically characterized primary tumors were analyzed in this study. The TILs in these tumors were found to preferentially express certain TCR V alpha and V beta regions. The differential usage of certain V alpha regions was very pronounced as illustrated by V alpha 4, which was highly expressed in 3/8 tumors, and V alpha 22, which was highly expressed in 4/8 tumors. For comparison, specific highly expressed V alpha regions in control samples of peripheral-blood lymphocytes rarely exceeded 10%. The most highly expressed V beta region was V beta 8, which was highly expressed in 2/8 tumors. For the highly expressed V alpha 4 and V alpha 22 and V beta 8 regions, the high levels may be explained by the in situ clonal or oligoclonal expansion of TIL. In one specific case, the high expression of V beta 8 was due to expansion of a single clone of TILs, as evidenced by a fully readable sequence of the CDR3 (V-D-J) region, determined by direct sequencing of the PCR product corresponding to V beta 8. In contrast, sequence analysis of V alpha 22, which was expressed in the same tumor sample at similar levels, demonstrated the simultaneous presence of 3 different CDR3 (V-J) sequences derived from V alpha 22 transcripts of exactly the same length. The observed preferential use of TCR V alpha and V beta regions suggests the in situ clonal expansion of specific populations of T-cells, possibly reactive with melanoma-associated peptides presented by HLA molecules. The preferential use of TCR V alpha and V beta regions may imply the involvement of a limited number of shared melanoma-associated peptides.",

The TCR alpha- and beta-chain genes from a tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte, which recognized the tyrosinase 368-376 peptide in the context of HLA-A2, were cloned into a gamma-retroviral vector. Following transduction of PBL, specific reactivity was confirmed by cytokine production following coculture with tumor targets. Experiments using Ab blockade and CD4/CD8 sorting of the transduced PBLs demonstrated that this antityrosinase TCR was CD4/CD8 independent. The introduction of a second disulfide bond between the TCR constant regions and/or creation of a chimeric protein in which the human constant regions were replaced by murine homologs resulted in enhanced TCR expression as demonstrated by tetramer staining and improved tumor reactivity that was comparable to PBL transduced with either anti-melanoma Ag recognized by T cells-1 or anti-gp100 TCR vectors currently used in clinical trials. The chimeric TCR also allowed us to test antitumor function of in HLA-A2/K(b)-transgenic mice. Transfer of the antityrosinase TCR into mouse splenocytes conferred CD4/CD8-independent, HLA-A2-restricted Ag reactivity against B16/A2K(b) murine melanoma in vitro. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of transduced splenocytes mediated B16/A2K(b) melanoma tumor regression in lymphodepleted mice, and, surprisingly, both CD8 and CD4 T cells were equally effective in mediating tumor regression. These results suggest that this highly active tyrosinase-specific TCR could be of value in adoptive cell transfer for melanoma.",

TIL-based ACT has so far only been tested in smaller phase I/II studies, but these studies consistently confirm an impressive clinical response rate of up to 50 % in metastatic melanoma including a significant proportion of patients with durable complete tumor eradication. These remarkable results justify the need for a definitive phase III trial documenting the efficacy of this type of T cell-based Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product in order to pave the way for regulatory approval and implementation of TIL therapy as a new treatment standard in oncology practice. TIL-based ACT can, however, only be offered to a limited group of patients based on the need for accessible tumor tissue, the complexity of TIL production procedures, and the very intensive nature of this three-step treatment including both high-dose chemotherapy and interleukin-2 in addition to T cell infusion.

For survival studies, mice were injected intravenously on day 0 with CL62 (a p97-transfected clone of the K1735 murine melanoma tumor). Day-3 treatments included saline (control), SEB (50 gamma g intraperitoneal) with or without bsAb (5 micrograms i.v.). Cured mice, surviving beyond 60 days, were rechallenged with subcutaneous CL62, K1735, or a nonmelanoma control, AG104. SEB activation studies were performed with pulmonary tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes isolated from 10-day established CL62 tumors. Maximal tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cytotoxicity was demonstrated 24 h following SEB injection, therefore bsAb treatments were administered 24 h after SEB. When survival was examined at 60 days, there were significantly more survivors in the group receiving SEB plus bsAb (70%) compared to the group receiving SEB alone (30%), and the controls (0%) (P = 0.02 and P < 0.01, respectively). Mice cured of CL62 using SEB alone or with bsAb demonstrated equal immunity to CL62, however, mice treated with SEB plus bsAb were more often immune to the p97-parental cell line, K1735(P = 0.001).

First, analysis of a set of 10 HLA-A*02:01-restricted T cell clones demonstrated that staining with pMHC multimers of seven distinct subtypes of the HLA-A*02 allele group was highly variable and not predicted by sequence homology. Second, to analyze the effect of minor sequence variation in a clinical setting, we screened tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of an HLA-A*02:06 melanoma patient with either subtype-matched or HLA-A*02:01 multimers loaded with 145 different melanoma-associated Ags. This revealed that of the four HLA-A*02:06-restricted melanoma-associated T cell responses observed in this patient, two responses were underestimated and one was overlooked when using subtype-mismatched pMHC multimer collections.

However, determining a lesion's biological behavior primarily on CGH is limited by a relatively small series of corroborative cases without long term follow up. We present a case of a pigmented lesion on the right cheek of a 4 year old boy. The lesion had features of a deep penetrating nevus, but the presence of frequent mitoses, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and microscopic foci of tumor necrosis were concerning for an unusual melanoma. We termed this lesion a melanocytic tumor of uncertain potential (MELTUMP) for these reasons. High-resolution array-CGH performed elsewhere on the lesion demonstrated no melanoma-associated genomic abnormalities. A sentinel lymph node biopsy of this patient later revealed multiple small tumor deposits. Although the presence of nodal involvement in similar lesions often do not lead to progressive and fatal disease, this case illustrates that atypical melanocytic lesions with nodal involvement may not demonstrate genomic abnormalities by CGH, and that histopathologic assessment remains paramount in defining these difficult melanocytic lesions.

Lymphocytes are being engineered to express high affinity T cell receptors (TCRs), chimeric antibody-T cell receptors (CARs) and cytokines. T cell subsets with more naïve and stem cell-like characteristics have been shown in pre-clinical models to be more effective than unselected populations and it is now possible to reprogram T cells and to produce T cells with stem cell characteristics. In the future, combinations of adoptive transfer of T cells and specific vaccination against the cognate antigen can be envisaged to further enhance the effectiveness of these therapies.",

CD8(+)tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes reactive to clonal neoantigens were identified in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer and expressed high levels of PD-1. Sensitivity to PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade in patients with advanced NSCLC and melanoma was enhanced in tumors enriched for clonal neoantigens. T cells recognizing clonal neoantigens were detectable in patients with durable clinical benefit. Cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced subclonal neoantigens, contributing to an increased mutational load, were enriched in certain poor responders.

Two brain metastases cohorts, a mixed entity cohort (n = 252) and a breast carcinoma validation cohort (n = 96) were analyzed for CD3+, CD8+, FOXP3+, PD-1+ lymphocytes and PD-L1+ tumor cells by immunohistochemistry. Analyses for association with clinico-epidemiological and neuroradiological parameters such as patient survival or tumor size were performed. TILs infiltrated brain metastases in three different patterns (stromal, peritumoral, diffuse). While carcinomas often show a strong stromal infiltration, TILs in melanomas often diffusely infiltrate the tumors. Highest levels of CD3+ and CD8+ lymphocytes were seen in renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and strongest PD-1 levels on RCCs and melanomas. High amounts of TILs, high ratios of PD-1+/CD8+ cells and high levels of PD-L1 were negatively correlated with brain metastases size, indicating that in smaller brain metastases CD8+ immune response might get blocked. PD-L1 expression strongly correlated with TILs and FOXP3 expression. No significant association of patient survival with TILs was observed, while high levels of PD-L1 showed a strong trend towards better survival in melanoma brain metastases (Log-Rank p = 0.0537). In summary, melanomas and RCCs seem to be the most immunogenic entities.

Tumor cell suspensions from a variety of tumors were able to be separated using enzymatic techniques and they were cultured in medium containing recombinant interleukin-2. Activated infiltrating lymphocytes within these tumors expanded; and, by 6-8 days after initiation of culture, lymphocytes predominated and were able to grow to large numbers. The adoptive transfer of these tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) made possible mediation of the reduction of established 3-day pulmonary micrometastases from 5 of 7 tumors tested, including two 3-methylcholanthrene (CAS: 56-49-5)-induced sarcomas, one 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (CAS: 540-73-8)-induced colon carcinoma, and the B16 melanoma, all in C57BL/6 mice, as well as the 1660 bladder carcinoma in BALB/c mice. Approximately 2-4 X 10(6) transferred cells were capable of totally eliminating 3-day established metastases. These cells were thus 50 to 100 times more effective than lymphokine-activated killer cells in reducing established metastases; however, they could not be generated from all tumors. The concomitant administration of recombinant interleukin-2 enhanced, by approximately fivefold, the in vivo activity of these cells. The specificity of action of TILs in vivo was different from that determined by classic amputation rechallenge experiments. The tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that developed this antitumor reactivity appeared to be Thy-1+ and did not bear the asialo GM1 antigen.

Generating tumor-reactive lymphocyte cultures is technically difficult and resource intensive; these limitations have restricted the widespread application of ACT. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from melanoma contain tumor antigen-reactive cells. The \"standard\" method for producing TIL cultures for clinical administration requires extended in vitro expansion in interleukin-2, then identification of tumor-reactive cells by immunologic assays. We show here that limitations in reagents and methods during screening underrepresent the actual reactivity of TIL cultures. Furthermore, the extended culture times necessitated by the screening assays resulted in telomere shortening and reduced expression of CD27 and CD28 in the TIL cultures, properties that our prior studies showed are correlated with in vivo persistence and clinical response. We have thus developed an alternative \"young\" TIL method that demonstrated superior in vitro attributes compared with standard TIL. This approach uses the entire resected tumor to rapidly expand TIL for administration without in vitro testing for tumor recognition. Our observations suggest that younger TIL can have an undetermined but high level of antigen reactivity, and other advantageous attributes such as long telomeres and high levels of CD27 and CD28. We suggest that minimally cultured, unselected lymphocytes represent an alternative strategy for generating TIL cultures suitable for use in ACT that, if effective in vivo, may facilitate the widespread application of this approach to a broader population of patients with melanoma.",

The antitumor effects of locally produced IL-12 were examined in 2 tumor model systems. IL-12 expressing EMT6 mammary sarcomas (EMT6/IL-12) grew temporarily and then regressed resulting in mice that were immune to a further challenge of EMT6 cells. Interestingly, the IL-12 expressing K1735 melanomas (K1735/IL-12) maintained a lag phase of nonmeasurable growth for several weeks, followed by tumor outgrowth that was associated with a loss of IL-12 production. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) isolated from EMT6/IL-12 tumors effectively lysed EMT6 target cells, whereas K1735/IL-12 TILs lacked lytic activity. Both IL-12 expressing tumors, however, grew progressively in nude mice indicating an important role for T cells in each case. Recombinant murine interferon gamma (rmIFN-gamma) inhibited the growth of EMT6 cells, but not K1735 cells in vitro, and strongly induced the expression of the antiangiogenic chemokine interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) by both cell lines. Of interest, only the EMT6 cell line was able to secrete the proangiogenic molecule, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in response to low oxygen conditions. Fluorescent staining of the vascular endothelium at the tumor injection site provided images depicting early stages of angiogenesis prior to K1735/IL-12 tumor outgrowth. These results indicate that locally produced IL-12 likely mediates the rejection of EMT6 tumors through tumor cell lysis by host immune cells, whereas its antiangiogenic potential may be counterbalanced by the strong induction of VEGF by hypoxic tumor cells. In contrast, IL-12 does not induce protective immunity to K1735 tumors. However, an antiangiogenic mechanism may be responsible for controlling tumor growth.",

Further investigation showed that the observed proliferative stimulation by the fourth tumor line was due to secreted factor(s) as mitogenic activity was present in the serum-free tumor cell supernatant.

In this study, we profiled immunologic changes in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in a B-RafV600E/Pten-driven murine model of melanoma after administration of the B-Raf(V600E) small molecule inhibitor PLX4720. In this model, we found that as tumors developed, they gradually acquired immunosuppressive features, including accumulation of regulatory T cells (Treg) and CD11b(+)/Gr-1(+) myeloid cells and loss of Th1 effector functions on CD4(+) TILs, such as CD40L and IFNγ expression. PLX4720 administration promoted development of a more immune stimulatory microenvironment associated with a relative increase in CD40L and IFNγ expression on intratumoral CD4(+) TILs and a reduced accumulation of Tregs and CD11b(+)/Gr-1(+) myeloid cells. Strikingly, CD40L or IFNγ blockade compromised the ability of PLX4720 to inhibit melanoma growth. Supporting this result, agonistic CD40 antibody was sufficient to evoke antitumor immunity and suppress tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, our results establish the critical role of immune-related changes, with key contributions for CD40L and IFNγ signaling in the antitumor responses triggered in vivo by B-Raf(V600E) inhibitors.",

The approach has demonstrated remarkable clinical responses in several studies since. Reinfusion of TIL-derived T cells represents a highly personalized form of immunotherapy, taking into account the enormous interindividual tumor heterogeneity. However, despite its successes, TIL therapy does not lead to objective clinical responses in all cases. It is thus crucial to find out which tumor antigens are particularly valuable targets and to develop strategies to enhance the reactivity of T-cell products toward them. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, Kelderman et al. [Eur. J. Immunol. 2016. 46: 1351-1360] present a platform for the generation of antigen-specific TIL therapy. Combining recently developed technologies for clinical identification and enrichment of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells, such as MHC Streptamers and UV-mediated peptide exchange, the authors could enrich T-cell populations with defined antigen specificities from melanoma-derived TILs. This T-cell product showed higher reactivity against autologous tumor cell lines than bulk TIL-derived T cells. The novel platform might enable the generation of more effective and predictable TIL-derived T-cell products for future clinical applications. ",

All patients were treated with 720,000 IU/kg administered by 15-minute intravenous infusions every 8 hours for up to 5 days as clinically tolerated per cycle. Two cycles constituted a treatment course. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from melanoma patients were used to clone the genes encoding the tumor antigens responsible for clinical responsiveness.;Thirty-three of 409 (8.1%) patients treated with high-dose bolus IL-2 achieved a complete response and 37 (9%) achieved a partial response. Complete regression was seen in 6.6% and 9.3% of patients with metastatic melanoma and renal cancer, respectively. Twenty-seven of these 33 completely responding patients (82%) remain in ongoing continuous complete response from 39 to more than 148 months from the onset of treatment. Tumor regressions were seen at virtually all organ sites. The absence of prior treatment with immunotherapy, the total dose of IL-2 administered, and the maximal rebound lymphocytosis after cessation of IL-2 correlated with achieving a complete response. Expression cloning techniques have identified a series of tumor antigens that are recognized by TIL grown from resected melanomas. These antigens are mainly melanoma/ melanocyte differentiation antigens, although mutated intracellular proteins can also serve as antigens.;Treatment with high-dose bolus IL-2 mediates complete cancer regression in approximately 8% of patients with metastatic renal cancer and melanoma. The great majority of these patients will enter durable complete regressions and appear to be cured of their metastatic cancer. Thus, immunotherapy with high-dose bolus IL-2 should be considered as initial therapy for appropriately selected patients with metastatic melanoma and renal cell cancer.

AdVMART1 does not significantly down-regulate cell surface class I expression despite having an intact E3 region. Transduction of an HLA-A2-positive/MART-1-negative cell line with AdVMART1 renders these cells sensitive to lysis by CTL specific for the MART-1(27-35) immunodominant peptide. In addition, DC transduced with AdVMART1 stimulated MART-1(27-35)-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to synthesize IFN-gamma.

Increasing evidence suggests that the number, type and location of these tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in primary tumors has prognostic value, and this has led to the development of an 'immunoscore. As well as providing useful prognostic information, the immunoscore concept also has the potential to help predict response to treatment, thereby improving decision- making with regard to choice of therapy. This predictive aspect of the tumor microenvironment forms the basis for the concept of immunoprofiling, which can be described as 'using an individual's immune system signature (or profile) to predict that patient's response to therapy' The immunoprofile of an individual can be genetically determined or tumor-induced (and therefore dynamic). Ipilimumab is the first in a series of immunomodulating antibodies and has been shown to be associated with improved overall survival in patients with advanced melanoma. Other immunotherapies in development include anti-programmed death 1 protein (nivolumab), anti-PD-ligand 1, anti-CD137 (urelumab), and anti-OX40. Biomarkers that can be used as predictive factors for these treatments have not yet been clinically validated. However, there is already evidence that the tumor microenvironment can have a predictive role, with clinical activity of ipilimumab related to high baseline expression of the immune-related genes FoxP3 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and an increase in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. These biomarkers could represent the first potential proposal for an immunoprofiling panel in patients for whom anti-CTLA-4 therapy is being considered, although prospective data are required. In conclusion, the evaluation of systemic and local immunological biomarkers could offer useful prognostic information and facilitate clinical decision making. The challenge will be to identify the individual immunoprofile of each patient and the consequent choice of optimal therapy or combination of therapies to be used.",

A limiting factor in the effectiveness of this treatment is the apoptosis of the transferred cells when Interleukin-2 (IL-2) administration is withdrawn. In an attempt to improve persistence of the transferred lymphocytes, we cotransduced human peripheral blood lymphocytes with retroviruses encoding Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, antiapoptotic genes of the BCL2 family, and the MART-1 melanoma tumor antigen-specific TCR, DMF5. Lymphocytes were cotransduced with 38% to 64% cotransduction efficiency, and exhibited a marked delay in apoptosis after IL-2 withdrawal. Cotransduction with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL did not affect cytokine secretion or lytic ability of the DMF5-transduced lymphocytes. After 5 days of IL-2 withdrawal, cotransduced lymphocytes produced similar levels of IFN-γ per cell as DMF5-alone transduced lymphocytes in response to tumor cells. Cotransduction did not alter the phenotype of lymphocytes with respect to a panel of T-cell differentiation markers. In a mouse model of melanoma, adoptively transferred T cells transduced with Bcl-2 persisted better in vivo at the site of tumor, 13 and 21 days after adoptive transfer (P=0.0064 and 0.041, respectively), with evidence of enrichment of the Bcl-2-transduced population over time (P<0.0001).

We previously showed that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from human melanoma and renal cell carcinoma demonstrate a dramatic decrease in their spontaneous locomotion through three-dimensional collagen gel when compared with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and lymph node lymphocytes. To determine if this decrease is caused by contact with tumor cells, or mediated through certain diffusible factors, we examined the effects of autologous tumor cells on the locomotion of PBL in a model system where tumor cells were separated from lymphocytes by a 3-mm layer of gelled collagen. After 21-22 h incubation in chamber slides, locomotion distances were assessed in the presence and absence of tumor and normal cells. In the presence of tumor cells, PBL from 14 of 18 patients displayed substantial (466.5 +/- 2.7 microns compared to control 568.9 +/- 10.9 microns, P < 0.001) loss of motility. Inhibition was more prominent in melanoma patients than in renal cell carcinoma patients. Thus the impaired locomotion previously observed in TIL was at least partially due to the presence of tumor. The locomotion of TIL was restored in four of five melanoma patients treated with liposome-encapsulated muramyl-tripeptide-phosphatidylethanolamine (L-MTP-PE). Furthermore, in six of seven examined L-MTP-PE-treated patients, an increase in intrinsic PBL locomotion during the first month of the therapy was observed. These results suggest that the environment of the tumor is not conducive to locomotion of advancing lymphocytes and the therapeutic intervention may ameliorate the loss of lymphocytic infiltration.",

To examine this issue, highly specific oligoclonal MHC class I-restricted cytolytic TIL grown in bulk culture from patient 397 were used to immunoselect a TIL-resistant variant tumor from the autologous cultured melanoma line 397-mel. Four cycles of immunoselection produced tumor 397-R4, a variant completely resistant to 397 TIL but not to allogeneic LAK cell lysis in 4-h 51Cr release assays. By flow microfluorometry analysis, this tumor variant had not lost MHC molecules, adhesion molecules, or a variety of tumor-associated Ag expressed by the parent tumor but showed decreased expression of many Ag examined. Failure of 397-R4 to cold target inhibit TIL lysis of 397-mel suggested that cell-surface modification was at least one mechanism causing TIL resistance. The inherent lysability of 397-R4 was equal to 397-mel, as confirmed by lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, lysis by non-MHC restricted allogeneic TIL, and lysis by a second line of 397 TIL grown independently from tumor 397. Treatment of 397-R4 with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma, +/- TNF-alpha for 72 h before cytolytic assays enhanced TIL lysis of this target slightly, and enhanced surface expression of MHC class I and II molecules and the adhesion molecule ICAM-1. The resistant phenotype of 397-R4 was evident in all clones of 397-R4 examined and has been maintained in serial culture for over 13 mo and through passage in nude mice, suggesting that such stable tumor variants may provide an in vivo escape mechanism from specific immune reagents such as TIL. Evolving patterns of TIL culture clonality over time, as well as the spontaneous emergence of different clones in two long term TIL cultures grown under identical conditions from the same source of cryopreserved tumor, were documented by analyzing TCR gene rearrangements and suggest that TIL from different culture passages or lines may be used to overcome resistant tumor subpopulations.",

A crucial step in this research effort has been the derivation of an allogeneic cell line (FO1-12) that expresses both a dominant selectable marker (neomycin resistance) and a recessive selectable marker (sensitivity to hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine), which allows easy selection of semiallogeneic cell hybrids derived from the fusion of FO1-12 cells with patient-derived tumor cells. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes derived from select patients with melanoma and exposed to semiallogeneic cell hybrids from the same patient were better able to specifically lyse autologous tumor cells. Furthermore, FO1-12 cells express carcinoembryonic antigen, which is ubiquitous in adenocarcinomas, and fusion of FO1-12 cells with various patient-derived adenocarcinoma cells showed that the hybrid cells also express carcinoembryonic antigen. Because of the results of these preclinical studies, the authors were given permission to use semiallogeneic cell hybrids for immunotherapy of patients with metastatic melanoma or metastatic adenocarcinoma who had not responded to standard treatment regimens.

This review gives an overview of available data about correlates analyzed in the serum, all in immune cell subsets in the peripheral blood or in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. We will discuss how to prospectively validate and integrate these parameters for routine assessment of patients in daily clinical practice and give an outlook on promising future directions of biomarker research.",

With the identification and characterization of tumor antigens recognized by TIL, we now see the use of these antigens in various forms constituting vaccines. Investigators are using tumor antigens alone or in combination with dendritic cells (DCs), the body's most efficient and powerful antigen-presenting cell. Therapies are being delivered to many patients with different types of cancer in order to combat bulky disease, eliminate micro-metastatic disease, and provide a memory mechanism to fight tumor recurrence.

One example of such a heterogeneous immune population is tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), whose output can be measured in terms of its reactivity against tumors. While the degree of reactivity varies considerably between different TILs, ranging from null to a potent response, the underlying network that governs the reactivity is poorly understood. Here, we asked whether one can predict and even control this reactivity. To address this we measured the subpopulation compositions of 91 TILs surgically removed from 27 metastatic melanoma patients. Despite the large number of subpopulations compositions, we were able to computationally extract a simple set of subpopulation-based rules that accurately predict the degree of reactivity. This raised the conjecture of whether one could control reactivity of TILs by manipulating their subpopulation composition. Remarkably, by rationally enriching and depleting selected subsets of subpopulations, we were able to restore anti-tumor reactivity to nonreactive TILs. Altogether, this work describes a general framework for predicting and controlling the output of a cell mixture.",

Tumors were harvested from surgical specimens 17 days after the end of chemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (CVD). Tumors of nonlymph-node metastases from two responders yielded neither TILs nor tumor cells, whereas those from all four nonresponders had both TILs [(1.1-13.8) x 10(6) cells/g tumor] and tumor cells [(2.8-30.8) x 10(6) cells/g tumor). Tumors of lymph node metastases from nine patients yielded substantial numbers both of TILs and tumor cells, regardless of different clinical responses, except with one complete responder, whose tumor did not contain tumor cells. The mean increase of TILs from these tumors (n = 14) 3-4 weeks after incubation with 200 U/ml recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) was 2.5-fold, whereas there was a 56-fold increase in TILs from untreated tumors (n = 3). CD3+ T cells predominated in TILs before and after expansion with IL-2. IL-2-activated TILs from five of six tumors tested displayed higher cytotoxicity against autologous tumor cells than against cells from any of three allogeneic tumors. Mean tumor cell numbers (10(6) cells/trial) obtained by serial needle biopsies for the same tumor in five patients decreased from 1.2 before therapy to 0.25 at day 4 of therapy (interferon alpha alone), and to 0.02 at day 8 (interferon alpha and IL-2). This decrease did not correlate with clinical responses. Yields (x 10(6) cells/g tumor) of TILs and tumor cells in subcutaneous melanomas obtained by excisional biopsies in one nonresponder under IL-2 therapy were respectively 0.2 and 1.1 before therapy (day 0), 0.1 and less than 0.01 during (day 7), 0.2 and less than 0.01 at the end of therapy (day 21), and 0.5 and 0.5 at the time of tumor progression (day 66). Yields of TILs and tumor cells in the other nonresponder were respectively 3 and 26 before (day 0), 16 and 3 during (day 7), and 0.4 and less than 0.01 at the end of IL-2 therapy (day 17), and 2.5 and 6 at the time of progression (day 62). TILs in these two patients before therapy proliferated well in culture with IL-2 (570- and 720-fold, respectively), and showed higher cytotoxicity against autologous tumor cells, whereas none of those from the five tumors biopsied during or at the end of IL-2 therapy proliferated. TILs at the time of progression showed modest proliferation (54- and 76-fold, respectively) and showed major-histocompatibility-complex-nonrestricted cytotoxicity. In summary, a decrease in the number of live tumor cells did not always correlate with clinical response in either therapy. CVD chemotherapy may simply impair IL-2-induced proliferation of TILs. IL-2 therapy may induce transient unresponsiveness of TILs to IL-2.",

All melanomas were class I antigen positive. Fifty-three % of biopsied metastatic melanoma lesions, 58% of primary renal cell carcinomas, and neither of the two breast carcinomas expressed class II antigen prior to therapy. The pretreatment expression of class II antigens by a tumor was not predictive of a clinical response to recombinant interleukin 2-based therapy. After treatment, however, seven of seven biopsied regressing individual metastases intensely expressed DR antigen on over fifty percent of the cells while only three of ten nonresponding lesions did so.

Half of each culture was restimulated with irradiated autologous tumor every 14 days. In all groups, tumor feeding enhanced lymphocyte proliferation, although TILs and DLNs consistently proliferated longer and more rapidly than PBLs. Eight of 10 early cultures of TILs and DLNs contained greater or equal proportions of CD8+ cells compared with CD4+ cells, but in long-term cultures an inversion of that ratio was seen (CD4+ greater than CD8+). In short-term chromium release assays, specific lysis of autologous tumor was seen in tumor-fed TILs and DLNs from one patient with melanoma, DLNs from one patient with breast cancer, and TILs from one patient with lung cancer. Other cultures had nonspecific lytic activity. Specific cytotoxicity against autologous tumor sometimes became apparent only after prolonged culture and repeated restimulation with autologous tumor.

Here we describe a rigorous validation approach for each of these assays prior to their use for clinical sample analysis.;Standard operating procedures for each assay were established. HLA-A2 (A*0201) tetramer assay specific for gp100209(210M) and MART-126-35(27L), IFNgamma real time RT-PCR and ELISPOT methods were validated using tumor infiltrating lymphocyte cell lines (TIL) isolated from HLA-A2 melanoma patients. TIL cells, specific for gp100 (TIL 1520) or MART-1 (TIL 1143 and TIL1235), were used alone or spiked into cryopreserved HLA-A2 PBMC from healthy subjects. TIL/PBMC were stimulated with peptides (gp100209, gp100pool, MART-127-35, or influenza-M1 and negative control peptide HIV) to further assess assay performance characteristics for real time RT-PCR and ELISPOT methods. Validation parameters included specificity, accuracy, precision, linearity of dilution, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ). In addition, distribution was established in normal HLA-A2 PBMC samples. Reference ranges for assay controls were established.;The validation process demonstrated that the HLA-A2 tetramer, IFNgamma real time RT-PCR, and IFNgamma ELISPOT were highly specific for each antigen, with minimal cross-reactivity between gp100 and MelanA/MART-1. The assays were sensitive; detection could be achieved at as few as 1/4545-1/6667 cells by tetramer analysis, 1/50,000 cells by real time RT-PCR, and 1/10,000-1/20,000 by ELISPOT. The assays met criteria for precision with %CV < 20% (except ELISPOT using high PBMC numbers with %CV < 25%) although flow cytometric assays and cell based functional assays are known to have high assay variability. Most importantly, assays were demonstrated to be effective for their intended use. A positive IFNgamma response (by RT-PCR and ELISPOT) to gp100 was demonstrated in PBMC from 3 melanoma patients.

TILs were literally defined as \"tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes\", which a posteriori locate within the tumor tissues. Although such cells can be found, they fail to control the growth of tumor. Many have proposed diverse mechanisms for dysfunction of TILs with regard to the roles of immunosurveillance against cancer. However, only a few cancer types, e.g. melanoma, have seen the benefits brought by activating these cells for immunotherapy. Functional defects of TILs have been linked to abnormalities of signaling molecules; however, there is conflicting data. The death of TILs was attributed to expression of cancer-derived FasL, PD-1 and RCAS1, and cancer-induced activation-induced cell death (AICD). Confirmed by studies using TILs and animal models, the compromise of tumor-specific immune responses was thought to result from not only mechanisms of clonal anergy but also exhaustion and/or deletion. Furthermore, functional cytotoxic CD8(+) TILs might be rendered incompetent by cancer-induced up-regulation of inhibitory NK receptors or proximal signaling abnormalities. Additionally, immune privilege was partly attributed to recruitment of regulatory T cells to the tumor sites. The failure of IL-2 signaling, which stands at the center of T cell functionalities, had been linked to the enzymatic activity of cancer-derived matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Finally, the exploitation of IDO expression, an important enzyme in pregnancy-related immunosuppression, by cancer cells might play a role in tumor immunity. The disparity of cancer types, origin, developmental stages and individual genetic backgrounds likely account for differences, or even contradictions, which might be the reason why immunotherapy works only on a few cancer types. Delineating the mechanisms behind functional defects of TILs can help not only boost chances of the development of a successful cure but understand the not fully identified roles played by immune system in the face of malignancies.",

With an overall objective response rate of 56%, this T-cell immunotherapy provides an appealing alternative to other therapies, including conventional therapies with lower response rates. However, there are significant regulatory and logistical concerns associated with the ex vivo activation and large-scale expansion of these cells. The best current practice uses a rapid expansion protocol (REP) consisting of an ex vivo process that occurs in tissue culture flasks (T-flasks) and gas-permeable bags, utilizes OKT3 (anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody), recombinant human interleukin-2, and irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells to initiate rapid lymphocyte growth. A major limitation to the widespread delivery of therapy to large numbers of melanoma patients is the open system in which a REP is initiated. To address this problem, we have investigated the initiation, expansion and harvest at clinical scale of TIL in a closed-system continuous perfusion bioreactor. Each cell product met all safety criteria for patient treatment and by head-to-head comparison had a similar potency and phenotype as cells grown in control T-flasks and gas-permeable bags.

An NK1.1+ T cell clone (TM4.2) was phenotypically CD3+ TCR-alphabeta+ CD4- CD8- NK1.1+, and CD28+. The TM4.2 cells suppressed the in vitro generation of anti-B16 melanoma CTLs, but not the effector function of CTLs. The results using a transwell membrane suggested that their suppressive activity was mediated by both soluble factors and a direct cell to cell interaction. As for the soluble factors, the suppressive activity of the culture supernatant of TM4.2 cells was neutralized by anti-TGF-beta mAb, and the TM4.2 cells actually produced a considerable amount of TGF-beta. On the other hand, the TM4.2 cells showed a high level of cytolytic activity against B cell blasts and CD80-transfected P815, and such cytolytic activity was reduced by the addition of anti-CD80 mAb. In addition, NK1.1+ T cells in the freshly isolated TIL were revealed to express CD28. Furthermore, the TM4.2 cells suppressed the in vitro generation of anti-allo CTLs irrespective of the MHC haplotype. Finally, the TM4.2 cells suppressed the in vivo antitumor immune response.

CD3,8 BSMAB cause selective cytolysis of CD8+ lymphocytes by bridging the CD8 molecules of target lymphocytes to the CD3 molecular complex of cytolytic T lymphocytes with concurrent activation and proliferation of residual CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes. Similarly, CD3,4 BSMAB cause selective lysis of CD4+ lymphocytes whereas concurrently activating the residual CD3+CD8+ T cells. Small tumor fragments from four malignant melanoma and three renal cell carcinoma patients were cultured in medium containing CD3,8 + IL-2, CD3,4 + IL-2, or IL-2 alone. CD3,8 led to selective propagation of the CD4+ TIL whereas CD3,4 led to selective propagation of the CD8+ TIL from each of the tumors. The phenotypes of the TIL subset cultures were generally stable when assayed over a 1 to 3 months period and after further expansion with anti-CD3 mAb or lectins. Specific 51Cr release of labeled target cells that were bridged to the CD3 molecular complexes of TIL suggested that both CD4+ and CD8+ TIL cultures have the capacity of mediating cytolysis via their Ti/CD3 TCR complexes. In addition, both CD4+ and CD8+ TIL cultures from most patients caused substantial (greater than 20%) lysis of the NK-sensitive K562 cell line. The majority of CD4+ but not CD8+ TIL cultures also produced substantial lysis of the NK-resistant Daudi cell line. Lysis of the autologous tumor by the TIL subsets was assessed in two patients with malignant melanoma. The CD8+ TIL from one tumor demonstrated cytotoxic activity against the autologous tumor but negligible lysis of allogeneic melanoma targets. In conclusion, immunocompetent CD4+ and CD8+ TIL subsets can be isolated and expanded directly from small tumor fragments of malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma using BSMAB. The resultant TIL subsets can be further expanded for detailed studies or for adoptive immunotherapy.",

Here we report that an antigenic peptide, MSLQRQFLR, recognized by TIL586 was not derived from the normal gp75 protein. Instead, this nonamer peptide resulted from translation of an alternative open reading frame of the same gene. Thus, the gp75 gene encodes two completely different polypeptides, gp75 as an antigen recognized by immunoglobulin G antibodies in sera from a patient with cancer, and a 24-amino acid product as a tumor rejection antigen recognized by T cells. This represents the first demonstration that a human tumor rejection antigen can be generated from a normal cellular gene using an open reading frame other than that used to encode the normal protein.

This led to the subject I will review in this article. A number of tumor antigens were isolated by the use of cDNA expression systems and biochemical approaches. These tumor antigens could be classified into several categories: tissue-specific differentiation antigens, tumor-specific shared antigens, and tumor-specific unique antigens. However, the majority of tumor antigens identified to date are nonmutated, self proteins. This raises important questions regarding the mechanism of antitumor activity and autoimmune disease. The identification of human tumor rejection antigens provides new opportunities for the development of therapeutic strategies against cancer.

In particular, transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes has resulted in long-term objective responses in patients with advanced melanoma. However, the inability to isolate sufficient numbers of tumor-specific T cells from most malignancies has restricted the broad utility of this approach. An emerging approach to circumvent this limitation involves the genetic modification of effector cells with T cell receptor (TCR) transgenes or chimeric single-chain variable fragment (scFv) receptors that can specifically redirect T cells to tumor. There has been much progress in the design of TCR and scFv receptors to enhance the antigen-specific activation of effector cells and their trafficking and persistence in vivo. Considerable effort has been directed toward improving the safety of this approach and reducing the immunogenicity of the receptor.

The addition of PM into the TIL cytotoxicity assay produced a concentration-dependent suppression of TIL cytotoxicity with up to 71% inhibition of autologous tumor killing at the 1:1 PM:TIL ratio. Inhibition was not target-specific, as killing of NK-sensitive (K562), NK-resistant (M14), and autologous tumor targets were equally suppressed. Nor was inhibition specific for lung TIL, as similar inhibition was observed with melanoma and renal TIL. Using a model system, we demonstrated that both CD3+ antigen-specific and CD56+ nonspecific lymphocytes are susceptible to the suppressive effects of the PM. Direct co-incubation of PM and TIL for 4 to 44 h resulted in progressive suppression of TIL proliferation and cytotoxicity. TIL cytotoxicity remained suppressed even if PM were removed from the co-culture after 24 h, but was restored if the separated TIL were re-incubated in interleukin-2.

One of the most common approaches is the so-called biochemotherapy, which is associated with increased toxicities, but without overall survival benefit. Another conventional strategy is the use of chemotherapy as an immunomodulator to enhance the effect of cancer vaccines or adoptive cell transfer therapy. Based on this approach, recent studies using chemotherapy to prepare the host before the infusion of ex vivo-activated, melanoma Ag-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and high dose IL-2 resulted in an impressive response rate. However, the development of immunotherapy for the treatment of a broad range of cancer type is still lacking. In this study, we report the development of a simple yet universal approach termed \"chemocentric chemoimmunotherapy\" that has potential application in the treatment of all cancer types. This technique uses nonspecifically activated CD4(+) T cells as a chemosensitizer before the administration of chemotherapy. Dramatic enhancement of the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic drugs, either active or nonactive as single agents, was observed both in in vitro and in vivo human tumor xenograft models. Soluble factors secreted from activated CD4(+) T cells, likely acting on the tumor and its microenvironment, were responsible for the observed effect. Although IFN-gamma played a major role in the therapeutic outcome, it was consistently found to be inferior to the use of activated CD4(+) T cells in tumor chemosensitization.

To facilitate the entry of the antigenic epitope into the endoplasmic reticulum, a sequence coding for adenovirus E3/19K leader peptide was added. This rVV-M was made replication-incompetent by treatment with psoralen and UV light. Infection with rVV-M rendered HLA-A2.1 EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of HLA-class-1-restricted, MART-1/Melan-A27-35-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). The capacity of rVV-M to generate HLA-A2.1-restricted MART-1/Melan A-specific CTL was demonstrated from tumor-infiltrating-lymphocyte (TIL) cultures and from healthy donors' peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).

All CTL generated upon rVV-M stimulation were also able to efficiently kill melanoma cell lines expressing both MART-1/Melan-A and HLA-A2.1. In addition, TNF-alpha production could be induced in rVV-M-stimulated CTL upon co-culture with COS-7 cells transiently transfected with MART-1/Melan-A and HLA-A2.1 genes.

Tumor specimens were obtained from two different sites in 7 patients, resulting in 41 samples from which 38 TIL cultures were established. In addition to screening 38 bulk TIL cultures, TIL from 21 patients were separated into CD4+ and CD8+ subsets and extensively studied. Three CD4+ TIL were found specifically to secrete granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor and tumor necrosis factor alpha when stimulated by autologous tumor and not by a large panel of stimulators (24-34) consisting of autologous normal cells, allogeneic breast or melanoma tumors and EBV-B cells. This cytokine release was found to be MHC-class-II-restricted, as it was inhibited by the anti-HLA-DR antibody L243. These 3 patients' EBV-B cells, when pulsed with tumor lysates, were unable to act as antigen-presenting cells and induce cytokine secretion by their respective CD4+ TIL. These findings demonstrate that MHC-class-II-restricted CD4+ T cells recognising tumor-associated antigens can be detected in some breast cancer patients.",

Although several studies have examined the direct effects of immunosuppressive drugs on cancer cells, little is known about the interactions between pharmacological immunosuppression and cancer immunosurveillance. We investigated the different effects of rapamycin (Rapa) versus cyclosporine A (CsA) on tumor-reactive CD8(+) T cells. After adoptive transfer of CD8(+) T cell receptor-transgenic OTI T cells, recipient mice received either skin grafts expressing ovalbumin (OVA) or OVA-expressing B16F10 melanoma cells. Animals were treated daily with Rapa or CsA. Skin graft rejection and tumor growth as well as molecular and cellular analyses of skin- and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were performed. Both Rapa and CsA were equally efficient in prolonging skin graft survival when applied at clinically relevant doses. In contrast to Rapa-treated animals, CsA led to accelerated tumor growth in the presence of adoptively transferred tumor-reactive CD8(+) OTI T cells. Further analyses showed that T-bet was downregulated by CsA (but not Rapa) in CD8(+) T cells and that cancer cytotoxicity was profoundly inhibited in the absence of T-bet. CsA reduces T-bet-dependent cancer immunosurveillance by CD8(+) T cells. This may contribute to the increased cancer risk in transplant recipients receiving calcineurin inhibitors. ",

In tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from a melanoma patient we found a high frequency of tyrosinase(368-376) peptide-specific cells as detected by IFN-gamma ELISPOT, without detectable staining with the corresponding A2/peptide multimers. Surprisingly, these T cells were able to lyse tyrosinase(368-376) peptide-pulsed target cells as efficiently as other specific T cells that were stained by multimers. Analysis of the staining patterns under different conditions of incubation time and temperature revealed that these results were explained by major differences in TCR-multimeric ligand interaction kinetics among the clones. Whereas no direct quantitative correlation between antigenic peptide concentration required for CTL effector functions and equilibrium multimer binding was observed interclonally, the latter was profoundly affected by the kinetics of TCR-ligand interaction.

Heptapeptides dimerized through DST and DSG linkers had optimal activity in CD69 precipitation assay. Moreover, dimerization of active heptapeptide resulted in a remarkable increase in its proliferation activity and production of cytokines in vitro. Furthermore, while DST and DSG dimerized heptapeptides both significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells in vitro, only the DSG dimerized compound was active in suppressing growth of melanoma tumors in mice and in enhancing the cytotoxic activity of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ex vivo.

We schematically divided approaches based on T lymphocytes specific for MHC-restricted tumor-associated antigens or relying on MHC-independent immune effectors such as natural killer (NK), cytokine-induced killer (CIK) or γδ T cells.;Preclinical findings and initial clinical reports showed the potentialities and drawbacks of different adoptive immunotherapy strategies. The expansion of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes is difficult to be reproduced outside melanoma. Genetically redirected T cells appear to be a promising option and initial reports are encouraging against patients with sarcomas. Adoptive immunotherapy with MHC-unrestricted effectors such as NK, CIK or γδ T cells has recently shown great preclinical potential in sarcoma setting and biologic features that may favor clinical transferability.

Furthermore, IL-12 appears to stimulate the production of a Th1 immune response. We have examined the effects of IL-12 on the proliferation and lytic activity of fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). IL-12 stimulates proliferation of PBMCs by as much as 10-fold after T-cell receptor (TCR) ligation induced by anti-CD3 or phytohemagglutinin. In contrast, IL-12 promotes only marginal proliferation of resting PBMCs. IL-12 modulates IL-2-induced lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activity: it inhibits IL-2 LAK when added early to culture but augments LAK activity in PBMCs preactivated by IL-12. IL-12 induces the proliferation (three- to fourfold above background) and enhances the cytolytic activity (two- to fourfold) of TIL lines and melanoma-derived, peptide-specific T-cell clones that have been recently restimulated with autologous tumor. These results suggest that IL-12 may serve in vivo to amplify and focus the cellular immune response by selectively inducing the outgrowth and enhancing the lytic potential of T and NK cells that have received the proper coactivation signals.",

Of several cellular proteins involved in T cell:target-cell interaction, the TCR determines specificity of binding; however, the relative amount of its contribution to cellular avidity remains unknown. To study the relationship between TCR affinity and cellular avidity, with the intent of identifying optimal TCR for gene therapy, we derived 24 MART-1:27-35 (MART-1) melanoma Ag-reactive tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) clones from the tumors of five patients. These MART-1-reactive clones displayed a wide variety of cellular avidities. alpha and beta TCR genes were isolated from these clones, and TCR RNA was electroporated into the same non-MART-1-reactive allogeneic donor PBMC and TIL. TCR recipient cells gained the ability to recognize both MART-1 peptide and MART-1-expressing tumors in vitro, with avidities that closely corresponded to the original TCR clones (p = 0.018-0.0003). Clone DMF5, from a TIL infusion that mediated tumor regression clinically, showed the highest avidity against MART-1 expressing tumors in vitro, both endogenously in the TIL clone, and after RNA electroporation into donor T cells. Thus, we demonstrated that the TCR appeared to be the core determinant of MART-1 Ag-specific cellular avidity in these activated T cells and that nonreactive PBMC or TIL could be made tumor-reactive with a specific and predetermined avidity. We propose that inducing expression of this highly avid TCR in patient PBMC has the potential to induce tumor regression, as an \"off-the-shelf\" reagent for allogeneic melanoma patient gene therapy.",

Gene transfer approaches can be used to \"mark\" cells to monitor their persistence in vivo in patients, to protect cells from toxic chemotherapeutic agents, correct a genetic defect within the target cell, or to confer a novel function on the target cell. Selection of the most suitable vector for gene transfer depends upon a number of factors such as the target cell itself and whether gene expression needs to be sustained or transient. The TCR gene transfer approach described here represents one innovative strategy being pursued as a potential therapy for metastatic melanoma. Tumor reactive T cells can be isolated from the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) of melanoma patients. A retroviral vector has been constructed containing the T cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chain genes from a MART-1-specific T cell clone (TIL 5). Jurkat cells transduced with this virus specifically release cytokine in response to MART-1 peptide pulsed T2 cells, showing that the virus can mediate expression of a functional TCR. HLA-A2 transgenic mice are being used to examine whether transduced bone marrow progenitor cells will differentiate in vivo into mature CD8+ T cells expressing the MART-1-specific TCR. Expression of the human TCR alpha and beta chain genes has been detected by RT-PCR in the peripheral blood of HLA-A2 transgenic mice reconstituted with transduced mouse bone marrow. Expression of the TIL 5 TCR genes in the peripheral blood of these mice was maintained for greater than 40 weeks after bone marrow reconstitution. TIL 5 TCR gene expression was also maintained following transfer of bone marrow from mice previously reconstituted with transduced bone marrow to secondary mouse recipients, suggesting that a pluripotent progenitor or lymphocyte progenitor cell has been transduced.",

A deeper understanding of the \"limiting\" toxicity associated with mild flu-like symptoms and more debilitating cytokine \"storm\" not forthcoming.

To deliver such stimulation under more favorable conditions, we investigated whether an allogeneic cell-based vaccine that secreted Fc-OX40L, Fc-ICOSL, or Fc-4-1BBL would activate and expand T cells comparably with systemically administered agonist antibodies. Among these costimulators, locally secreted Fc-OX40L provided superior priming of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells, compared with combinations with OX40 antibodies or vaccine alone. Vaccine-expressed Fc-OX40L also stimulated IFNγ, TNFα, granzyme B, and IL2 by antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells similarly to OX40 antibodies, without off-target consequences such as proinflammatory cytokine induction. Vaccine-secreted Fc-OX40L increased CD127(+)KLRG-1(-) memory precursor cells during the contraction phase, resulting in improved proliferation upon secondary antigen challenge, as compared with OX40 antibody. A cell-based vaccine cosecreting gp96-Ig and Fc-OX40L led to even more pronounced tumor control, complete tumor rejection, and increased tumor antigen-specific T-cell proliferation, including in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, as compared with combinations of gp96-Ig vaccine and OX40 antibodies, in mice with established melanoma or colorectal carcinoma. These data suggest that local modulation of the vaccine microenvironment has unexpected advantages over systemic costimulation with agonistic antibodies, which may simplify the clinical translation of such combination immunotherapies into humans.

This finding has led to the identification and characterization of tumor-associated antigens recognized by CD8+ TIL. Several clinical trials based on the genes recognized by these CD8+ T cells have been attempted, but with only limited success. Meanwhile, increasing evidence has demonstrated that CD4+ T cells play important roles in generating and maintaining antitumor immune responses in animal models. These data suggest that it may be necessary to engage both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells for more effective antitumor immunotherapy. In this report, we review emerging molecular approaches in cloning major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II restricted tumor antigens recognized by CD4+ T cells as well as approaches to identify new MHC class II-restricted epitopes from known tumor antigens recognized by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and/or antibodies. Progress made in this field has shed light on the roles of tumor antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in humans; it has also provided new insights into the understanding of tumor genesis and the interaction between tumor and the immune system. More importantly, the discovery of MHC class II-restricted tumor antigens has provided opportunities for developing a new generation of cancer vaccines aimed at eliciting both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against tumor.",

We have recently demonstrated high percentages of Th17 cells in TILs from ovarian cancer patients, but the mechanisms of accumulation of these Th17 cells in the tumor microenvironment are still unclear. In this study, we further showed elevated Th17 cell populations in the TILs obtained from melanoma and breast and colon cancers, suggesting that development of tumor-infiltrating CD4(+) Th17 cells may be a general feature in cancer patients. We then demonstrated that tumor microenvironmental RANTES and MCP-1 secreted by tumor cells and tumor-derived fibroblasts mediate the recruitment of Th17 cells. In addition to their recruitment, we found that tumor cells and tumor-derived fibroblasts produce a proinflammatory cytokine milieu as well as provide cell-cell contact engagement that facilitates the generation and expansion of Th17 cells. We also showed that inflammatory TLR and nucleotide oligomerization binding domain 2 signaling promote the attraction and generation of Th17 cells induced by tumor cells and tumor-derived fibroblasts. These results identify Th17 cells as an important component of human TILs, demonstrate mechanisms involved in the recruitment and regulation of Th17 cells in tumor microenvironments, and provide new insights relevant for the development of novel cancer immunotherapeutic approaches.",

The efficacy of this approach may be improved by providing adjuvant signals and an inflammatory environment for immune cell activation. We evaluated antitumor immune responses in mice after treatment of OVA-expressing B16-F0 tumors with single (15 Gy) or fractionated (5 x 3 Gy) doses of localized ionizing radiation. Irradiated mice had cells with greater capability to present tumor Ags and specific T cells that secreted IFN-gamma upon peptide stimulation within tumor-draining lymph nodes than nonirradiated mice. Immune activation in tumor-draining lymph nodes correlated with an increase in the number of CD45(+) cells infiltrating single dose irradiated tumors compared with nonirradiated mice. Similarly, irradiated mice had increased numbers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that secreted IFN-gamma and lysed tumor cell targets. Peptide-specific IFN-gamma responses were directed against both the class I and class II MHC-restricted OVA peptides OVA(257-264) and OVA(323-339), respectively, as well as the endogenous class I MHC-restricted B16 tumor peptide tyrosinase-related protein 2(180-188). Adoptive transfer studies indicated that the increased numbers of tumor Ag-specific immune cells within irradiated tumors were most likely due to enhanced trafficking of these cells to the tumor site. Together these results suggest that localized radiation can increase both the generation of antitumor immune effector cells and their trafficking to the tumor site.",

Systemic activation, measured as the ability of splenocytes to lyse tumor cells in vitro in the presence of BFA, was enhanced by the in vivo administration of SEB but not by beta-glucan or F(ab')2 BFA. Despite lacking a systemic effect, F(ab')2 BFA increased both direct and BFA-mediated cytotoxicity in fresh tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. beta-Glucan did not increase systemic or intratumor T cell activation. However, it significantly enhanced the ability of splenocytes to lyse NK-sensitive YAC-1 cells. When tested in a pulmonary metastases model, all three forms of immune modulation combined with F(ab')2 BFA significantly reduced the number of metastases. BFA were more effective at tumor neutralization when combined with SEB compared with adoptively transferred, in vitro-activated splenocytes.

ACT results in the repopulation of the host with high frequencies of tumor-specific T cells; however, optimal function of these cells within the tumor micro-environment is required to reach long-term tumor clearance. We and others have shown that ongoing anti-tumor immune responses can be impaired by the expression of ligands, such as PD-L1 (B7-H1) on tumor cells. Such inhibitory molecules can affect T cells at the effector phase via their receptor PD-1. PD-L1/PD-1 interaction has indeed been shown crucial in inducing T-cell anergy and maintaining peripheral tolerance. In order to maximize anti-tumor responses, antibodies that target the PD-1/PD-L1 axis are currently in phase I/II trials. Alternatively, a more refined approach could be the selective targeting of PD-1 in tumor-specific T cells to obtain long-term resistance against PD-1-mediated inhibition. We addressed whether this goal could be achieved by means of retroviral siRNA delivery. Effective siRNA sequences resulting in the reduction of surface PD-1 expression led to improved murine as well as human T-cell immune functions in response to PD-L1 expressing melanoma cells. These data suggest that blockade of PD-1-mediated T-cell inhibition through siRNA forms a promising approach to achieve long-lasting enhancement of tumor-specific T-cell function in adoptive T-cell therapy protocols.",

Initially, gene therapy was thought to be implemented mainly for the treatment of monogenetic diseases, such as adenosine deaminase deficiency. However, other therapeutic areas have become of interest and currently cancer is the most studied therapeutic area for gene therapy based medicines. In this review I will be giving a short introduction into gene therapy and will direct the discussion to where we should go from here. Furthermore, I will focus on the use of the Herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase for gene therapy of malignant gliomas and highlight the efficacy of gene therapy for the treatment of malignant gliomas, but other strategies will also be mentioned.

The use of aggressive chemotherapy has drastically improved the prognosis of the patients with non-metastatic osteosarcomas, however the prognosis of the patients with metastasis is still very poor. Then, new and more effective treatments for curing osteosarcoma, such as immunotherapy are needed. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) have been involved in the control of tumor development and already assessed with success for the treatment of several cancers including melanoma. While TIL represent a fascinating therapeutic approach in numerous malignant pathologies, there is few report concerning adult bone-associated tumors including osteosarcoma.;Human TIL were isolated and characterized (phenotype, lytic activity) from twenty-seven patients with bone-associated tumors (osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, giant cell tumor, chondrosarcoma, plasmocytoma and bone metastases). Similar experiments were performed using rat osteosarcoma model.;While TIL with a main CD4+ profile were easily isolated from most of the tumor samples, only TIL extracted from osteosarcoma were cytotoxic against allogeneic tumor cells. In all cases, TIL lytic activity was significantly higher compared to autologous peripheral blood leukocytes. Similar data were observed in rat osteosarcoma model where TIL were characterized by a main CD4+ profile and high lytic activity against allogeneic and autologous tumor cells. Moreover, rat TIL expansion was not accompanied by refractoriness to further activation stimulus mainly by tumor antigens.;These results demonstrated that TIL therapy could be a very efficient strategy for the treatment of adult osteosarcoma.",

In this procedure, TILs from resected tumors are expanded in vitro, then administered to patients and further stimulated to proliferate in vivo by the administration of high dose IL-2. After in vitro expansion, TILs are often dominated by a few specific clonotypes, and recently it was reported that the persistence in vivo of one or more of these clonotypes correlated with positive therapeutic response. We and others have previously shown that repeated in vitro stimulation and clonal expansion of normal human T lymphocytes results in progressive decrease in telomerase activity and shortening of telomeres, ultimately resulting in replicative senescence. In the studies reported here, we therefore compared telomerase activity and telomere length in persistent and nonpersistent TIL clonotypes before transfer in vivo, and found a correlation between telomere length and clonal persistence. We also observed that TILs proliferate extensively in vivo in the days after transfer, but fail to induce substantial telomerase activity, and undergo rapid decreases in telomere length within days after transfer. Thus, in vivo loss of telomeres by clonotypes that have the shortest telomeres at the time of administration may drive these clones to replicative senescence, whereas cells with longer telomeres are able to persist and mediate antitumor effects. These findings are relevant both to predicting effectiveness of adoptive immunotherapy and in deriving strategies for improving effectiveness by sustaining telomere length.",

Here, we describe the identification of a novel melanoma antigen recognized by an human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR1-restricted CD4(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)1363 using a genetic cloning approach. DNA sequencing analysis indicated that this was a fusion gene generated by a low density lipid receptor (LDLR) gene in the 5' end fused to a GDP-L-fucose:beta-D-galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase (FUT) in an antisense orientation in the 3' end. The fusion gene encoded the first five ligand binding repeats of LDLR in the NH2 terminus followed by a new polypeptide translated in frame with LDLR from the FUT gene in an antisense direction. Southern blot analysis showed that chromosomal DNA rearrangements occurred in the 1363mel cell line. Northern blot analysis detected two fusion RNA transcripts present only in the autologous 1363mel, but not in other cell lines or normal tissues tested. Two minimal peptides were identified from the COOH terminus of the fusion protein.

Upon T-cell receptor stimulation, lovastatin significantly inhibited the proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from healthy donors whereas their intracellular cytokine production including interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α remained the same with a slight decrease of interleukin-2. Moreover, the specific lysis of target cells by CTL lines derived from patients and normal donors specific for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded antigen latent membrane protein-2 or cytomegalovirus-encoded antigen pp65 was uncompromised in the presence of lovastatin. In addition, we evaluated the effect of lovastatin on the proliferation and effector function of the CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) derived from melanoma patients specific for MART-1 antigen. Lovastatin significantly reduced the expansion of antigen-specific TILs upon MART-1 stimulation. However, the effector function of TILs, including the specific lysis of target cells and secretion of cytokine interferon-γ, remained intact with lovastatin treatment. Taken together, these data demonstrated that lovastatin inhibits the proliferation of Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and MART-1-specific CTLs without affecting cytolytic capacity. The differential effect of lovastatin on the proliferation versus cytotoxicity of CTLs might shed some light on elucidating the possible mechanisms of graft-versus-host disease and graft-versus-tumor effect elicited by alloimmune responses.",

In recent years Foxp3(+) regulatory T-cells (T(R)) were identified as the major obstacle to effective cancer immunotherapy. The abundance of these cells in peripheral blood is increased in patients with multiple types of cancer and their prevalence among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes correlated with poor clinical prognosis. In contrast, removal or inactivation of T(R) cells led to enhanced anti-tumor immune response and better efficacy of cancer vaccines. This study reports that Bone Morphogenic Protein Receptor 1α (BMPR1α, Alk-3) is expressed by activated effector CD4(+) and T(R) cells and modulates functions of both cell types. Bone Morphogenic Proteins (BMPs) belong to the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β family of cytokines that also include TGFβ and activins. BMPs play crucial roles in embryonic development, tissue differentiation and homeostasis, and development of cancer. It was demonstrated that BMPs and activins synergize with TGFβ to regulate thymic T-cell development, maintain T(R) cells, and control peripheral tolerance. Inactivation of BMPR1α in T-cells results in impaired thymic and peripheral generation of T(R) cells. BMPR1α-deficient activated T-cells produced a higher level of interferon (IFN)-γ than BMPR1α-sufficient T-cells. Moreover, transplanted B16 melanoma tumors grew smaller in mice lacking expression of BMPR1α in T-cells and tumors had few infiltrating TR cells and a higher proportion of CD8(+) T-cells than wild-type mice.",

In this study, the interactions between IL-2, CD27, and its ligand CD70 and their effects on human T cell function were examined. Unstimulated CD8(+) T cells expressed relatively low levels of CD70 and high levels of CD27. Incubation in vitro with high doses of IL-2 (3,000 IU/ml) or administration of IL-2 in vivo resulted in substantial up-regulation of CD70 expression and the concomitant loss of cell surface CD27 expression on CD8(+) cells. Withdrawal of IL-2 from activated CD8(+) T cells that had been maintained in IL-2 resulted in a reversal of the expression of these two markers, whereas reciprocal changes were seen following treatment of PBMCs with IL-2. The proliferation observed in cells stimulated with IL-2 primarily occurred in a subset of the CD70(+)CD8(+) T cells that up-regulated IL-2 receptor expression but did not occur in CD70(-)CD8(+) T cells. Blocking CD70 resulted in a significant reduction of T cell proliferation induced by high-dose IL-2, indicating that the interaction of CD70 with CD27 played a direct role in T cell activation mediated by IL-2. Finally, studies conducted on tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) samples that were administered to melanoma patients indicated that the size of the pool of CD27(+)CD8(+) T cells in bulk TILs was highly associated (p = 0.004) with the ability of these TILs to mediate tumor regression following adoptive transfer.",

We demonstrated that B7-H1 expressed by residual tumor cells was responsible for the resistance of tumor to the therapy with HSP70 vaccine. Blockade of B7-H1 by i.v. injection pPD-1A, a plasmid encoding the extracellular domain of PD-1 (sPD-1), could reverse this resistance and enhance the therapeutic efficacy. To complement these findings, we investigated the gene expression of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) by Real-time PCR analysis, which revealed that the expression of TH1 cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-2 by TIL in the mice treated with HSP70 vaccine in combination with sPD-1 was increased and the expression of negative regulatory molecules IL-10, TGF-beta and foxp3 was decreased, demonstrating that multifunctional properties afforded by the combination therapy can effectively overcome tumor resistance and promote effective antitumor immunity. The in vivo transfection with pPD-1A could be performed as infrequently as once a week and still produce a significant antitumor effect.

In contrast to melanoma, CTL showing MHC-restricted lysis of RCC have not been easily found among tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). This has led to the suggestion by some that responses to immunotherapy are mediated predominantly by non-MHC-restricted effector cells. We have characterized an MHC-restricted, CD8+ CTL line obtained from an uncloned TIL population of a primary RCC using a low concentration of rIL-2; in fact, these CTL represented a majority of the short-term cultured TIL population. The CTL lysed autologous tumor cells but not normal kidney cells or target cells sensitive to non-MHC-restricted effector cells. In contrast, lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells grown in a high concentration of rIL-2 from the patient's PBL lysed autologous tumor and normal kidney cells in addition to several allogeneic tumors. The TIL could be expanded optimally using an autologous tumor line retrovirally transduced with the human cDNA encoding IL-2. TIL were 20-fold more potent than LAK cells in eliminating the IL-2 expressing tumor cells in vitro. The cultured TIL utilized a restricted number of V alpha gene families, suggesting that they may recognize only a limited number of MHC-peptide complexes presented by autologous tumor cells. HLA-A2 was identified as an MHC restriction molecule for presentation of one tumor-derived peptide to these CTL. Only some allogeneic HLA-A2 RCC tumors were lysed. Sequencing of the second and third exons of the HLA-A2 alleles of these cells revealed that both heterogeneity in MHC and peptide availability influenced CTL recognition. These studies demonstrate that some RCC express common antigenic determinants that can be recognized by MHC-restricted CTL and open the possibility of defining the nature of RCC-derived peptides, which, combined with HLA-A2, can generate specific immune responses.",

Sensitive methods to detect changes in the frequency of TCR subfamilies or clonotypes might be useful in evaluating the efficacy of vaccines against infectious agents, immunotherapy treatments for cancer patients, or the status of autoimmune diseases. Two HLA-A2 restricted CTL clones expressing BV17 were isolated from a tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) culture of a patient with metastatic melanoma. One clone recognized the MART-1(27-35) peptide and the other clone recognized the gp100(209-217) peptide. The frequency of each of these CTL clones in an expanding TIL culture was measured using a novel competitive RT-PCR (cRT-PCR) strategy. cRT-PCR uses a single primer pair to amplify template cDNA simultaneously with a modified DNA competitor molecule. A rapid two-step PCR technique followed by a single cloning step was used to generate a TCR BV17 subfamily specific competitor or competitors specific for the MART-1(27-35) reactive CTL clone (CO-41) and the gp100(209-217) reactive CTL clone (CO-4). Each competitor contained a segment of the TCR BC region that served as an internal reference standard. Using the BV17 competitor we were able to accurately and reproducibly measure cDNA templates at a frequency as low as 1/100,000 using cDNA samples of known TCRBV subfamily composition. This competitor was used to monitor the frequency of BV17 expressing T cells in the TIL and PMBC of a patient with metastatic melanoma. We determined that the frequency of BV17 expressing T cells increased from 4.5% of the culture on day 35 to 60.7% of the culture on day 58. Expansion of the BV17 subfamily was due predominantly to the expansion of the CO-4 clone. This method can be used to meaningfully quantify the precursor frequency of T cell mRNA in prepared samples via TCR subfamily or TCR sequence specific primers.",

The present study demonstrates for the first time that (1) PGE(2) and 2-chloroadenosine (CADO; a stable analog of adenosine) directly inhibit the cytolytic function of human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs); (2) the combination PGE(2) and CADO have additive suppressive effects; and (3) the cooperative immunosuppressive actions of PGE(2) and CADO are mediated via EP2 receptors (EP2Rs) and A(2A) receptors (A(2A)Rs) and are due to amplification of cAMP production, activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and T cell receptor (TCR) inhibitor Csk leading to inhibition of Lck, ZAP-70 and Akt phosphorylation. (4) During ex vivo expansion, TILs undergo three stages of differentiation converting from TILs with high cytotoxic activity and relative resistance to combined EP2R/A(2A)R suppression (stage I) to TILs retaining high cytotoxicity and gaining sensitivity to combined suppression (stage II) and then to TILS that are less cytotoxic and very sensitive to combined suppression (stage III). (5) Finally, we find that pretreatment of TILs with non-inhibitory concentrations of EP2R agonists (such as PGE(2) or butaprost) or A(2A)R agonists (such as CADO or CGS21680) increases their cytotoxic activity and induces resistance to EP2R and A(2A)R inhibitory signaling (cross-resistance) due to homologous and heterologous desensitization and internalization of EP2Rs and A(2A)Rs, thus preventing their inhibitory signaling. We conclude that inducing resistance of TILs to the suppressive effects of PGE(2) and adenosine in the tumor microenvironment could represent a novel strategy for improving the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy.",

Our goal was to correlate PD-L1 mRNA expression with clinical variables in primary breast carcinomas.;The fluorescent RNAscope paired-primer assay was used to quantify in situ PD-L1 mRNA levels in 636 stage I-III breast carcinomas on two sets of tissue microarrays [YTMA128 (n = 238) and YTMA201 (n = 398)]. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were assessed by hematoxylin/eosin stain and quantitative fluorescence.;On YTMA128 and YTMA201, 55.7% and 59.5% of cases showed PD-L1 mRNA expression, respectively. Higher PD-L1 mRNA expression was significantly associated with increased TILs (P = 0.04) but not with other clinical variables. Elevated TILs (scores 2 and 3+) occurred in 16.5% on YTMA128 and 14.8% on YTMA201 and was associated with estrogen receptor-negative status (P = 0.01 on YTMA128 and 0.0001 on YTMA201).

Analysis of the variability of T cell receptors (TCR) in the VIL of one patient revealed that the cytotoxic T lymphocytes consisted of a predominant population of TCRBV21S3+ T cells. Enrichment of this subpopulation to more than 99% by specific anti-TCRBV21S3 monoclonal antibody linked immunomagnetic beads and sequencing of the TCR-beta chain disclosed exactly the same V-D-J junctional sequence in all eight TCRBV21 transcripts from these VIL. The identical sequence was also detected in all eight TCRBV21 transcripts from the patient's tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, indicating that the same CTL clone had infiltrated the tumor, circulated in the peripheral blood, and was amplified at the vaccination site. The TCRBV21S3+ T cells were also found to display an MHC class I restricted cytotoxic activity specifically directed against the autologous tumor cells. At the beginning of treatment these cells were undetectable at the vaccination site and delayed-type hypersensitivity testing was negative, contrasting with the positive results after therapy.

The studies presented in this article were designed to determine the mechanisms involved in this enhanced activity and to support the future clinical testing of intratumoral administration of immunocytokines. Improved survival and inhibition of growth of both local and distant tumors were observed in A/J mice bearing s.c. NXS2 neuroblastomas treated with IT-IC compared with those treated with i.v.-IC or control mice. The local and systemic antitumor effects of IT-IC were inhibited by depletion of NK cells or T cells. IT-IC resulted in increased NKG2D receptors on intratumoral NKG2A/C/E⁺ NKp46⁺ NK cells and NKG2A/C/E⁺ CD8⁺ T cells compared with control mice or mice treated with i.v.-IC. NKG2D levels were augmented more in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes compared with splenocytes, supporting the localized nature of the intratumoral changes induced by IT-IC treatment. Prolonged retention of IC at the tumor site was seen with IT-IC compared with i.v.-IC.

In this study, we offer evidence that SMAC mimetics elicit a proinflammatory cell death in cancer cells that engages an adaptive antitumor immune response. Cancer cells of different histologic origin underwent apoptosis when transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding a cytosolic form of the SMAC mimetic LV-tSMAC. Strikingly, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with LV-tSMAC resulted in the induction of apoptosis, activation of antitumor immunity, and enhanced survival. Antitumor immunity was accompanied by an increase of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes displaying low PD-1 expression, high lytic capacity, and high levels of IFN-γ when stimulated. We also noted in vivo a decrease in regulatory T cells along with in vitro activation of tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells by dendritic cells (DC) isolated from tumor draining lymph nodes. Last, tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells were also found to be activated in vivo. Mechanistic analyses showed that transduction of cancer cells with LV-tSMAC resulted in exposure of calreticulin but not release of HMGB1 or ATP. Nevertheless, DCs were activated upon engulfment of dying cancer cells. Further validation of these findings was obtained by their extension in a model of human melanoma using transcriptionally targeted LV-tSMAC.

Employing the systemic application of recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) in humans, Rosenberg and colleagues from the National Cancer Institute reported the regression of advanced metastatic tumors in approximately 10%-30% of patients treated. The additional adoptive transfer of autologous patient-derived activated lymphocytes was performed to enhance therapeutic efficacy. While the exact mechanisms of IL-2 based immunotherapy in cancer remain unclear, it has been hypothesized that both the IL-2 activated lymphocyte and its secretory products such as interferon-gamma or tumor-necrosis factor beta may contribute to the lysis of tumor cells in vivo. Accordingly, research has been directed toward enhancing both the activation state and the specificity of IL-2 induced killer cells in humans. Based on in vitro and animal data, the retransfusion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes has been shown to mediate the regression of metastatic neoplasms in up to 50% of patients receiving systemic IL-2. Considerable toxicity from the use of high-dose IL-2 has prompted attempts to develop low-dose regimens which allow for the outpatient treatment of patients presenting poor prognosis. While in most clinical trials involving IL-2, patient follow-up has been short, and no or only limited data have become available from controlled prospective and randomized clinical studies, IL-2 has shown some promise in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer or malignant melanoma.

SCCs develop at a significantly higher rate under chronic immunosuppressive conditions, implicating a role of immune surveillance in controlling SCCs. It remains largely unknown how SCCs evade immune recognition. Here, we established a mouse model by injecting tumor cells derived from primary SCCs harboring KrasG12D mutation and Smad4 deletion into wild-type (wt) or CD8-/- recipients. We found comparable tumor growth between wt and CD8-/- recipients, indicating a complete escape of CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses by these SCCs. Mechanistically, CD8+ T cells apparently were not defective in infiltrating tumors given their relatively increased percentage among tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). CD8+ TILs exhibited phenotypes of chronic activation and exhaustion, including overexpression of activation markers, co-expression of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), as well as TCRβ downregulation. Among CD4+ TILs, T regulatory cells (Tregs) were preferentially expanded. Contradictory to prior findings in melanoma, Treg expansion was independent of CD8+ T cells in our SCC model. Unexpectedly, CD8+ T cells were required for promoting NK cell infiltration within SCCs. Furthermore, we uncovered AKT-dependent lymphocyte-induced PD-L1 upregulation on SCCs, which was contributed greatly by combinatorial effects of CD8+ T and NK cells. Lastly, dual blockade of PD-1 and LAG-3 inhibited the tumor growth of SCCs. Thus, our findings identify novel immune evasion mechanisms of SCCs and suggest that immunosuppressive mechanisms operate in a cancer-type specific and context-dependent manner.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Objective clinical responses have been observed in approximately 50% of patients who received non-myeloablative chemotherapy prior to the adoptive transfer of autologous melanoma-reactive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Recent studies carried out through the use of antibodies directed against T-cell-receptor beta chain variable region (TRBV) products, as well as by direct sequencing of the expressed TRBV gene products, indicated that clinical responses in this trial were associated with the level of persistence of adoptively transferred T cells. In an attempt to further characterize T cells that persist in vivo following adoptive transfer, five dominant T-cell clonotypes were identified in TIL 2035, an adoptively transferred TIL that was associated with the complete regression of multiple metastases. The most highly persistent clonotype, which expressed the BV1 TR gene product, recognized the MAGE-6 cancer/testis antigen in the context of HLA-A23. This clonotype was detected in peripheral blood for over 16 months following adoptive transfer, expressed relatively higher levels of the co-stimulatory markers CD28 and CD27, and possessed telomeres that were long relative to other clonotypes present in TIL 2035 that showed only short-term persistence. The long-term persistent BV1 clonotype appeared to differentiate more slowly toward an end-stage effector in vivo than short-term persistent clonotypes, as manifested by the downregulation of CD28, CD27, and CD45RO and upregulation of CD57 and CD45RA expression on these T cells. These results indicated that the differentiation stage and replicative history of individual TIL clonotypes might be associated with their ability to survive and to persist in vivo, and progressive differentiation of the persistent clonotypes occurred following adoptive transfer.",

The purpose of the present study was to test the potential of a series of Ii-Key/HER-2/neu776-790 hybrid peptides to generate increased frequencies of peptide-specific CD4+ T cells over the native peptide in mice transgenic (Tg) for a chimeric human mouse class II molecule (DR4-IE) (H-2b) as well as their antitumor potency. Following in vivo priming, such hybrid peptides induced increased proliferation and frequencies of IFN-gamma producing CD4+ T cells in response to either syngeneic dendritic cells pulsed with native peptide, or HLA-DR4+ human tumor cell lines expressing HER-2/neu. Hybrid peptides were more stable in an off-rate kinetics assay compared to the native peptide. In addition, antigen-specific CD4+ T cells from hybrid peptide immunized DR4-IE Tg mice synergized with HER-2/neu(435-443)-specific CD8+ T cells from HLA-A2.1 Tg HHD (H-2b) mice in producing antitumor immunity into SCID mice xenografted with the HER-2/neu+, HLA-A2.1+ and HLA-DR4+ FM3 human melanoma cell line. High proportions of these adoptively transferred HER-2/neu peptide-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infiltrated FM3-induced tumors (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes; TIL) in SCID mice. CD8+ TIL exhibited long-lasting antitumor activity when cotransferred with CD4+ TIL, inducing regression of FM3 tumors in a group of untreated, tumor-bearing SCID mice, following adoptive transfer.

Combined transfer of IL-2 gene and IL-6 gene was found to elicit inhibitory effects on the growth of B16F10 tumor more significantly and prolonged the survival period of tumor-bearing mice more obviously. We investigated the local immunity in tumor microenvironment and found that IL-2 and IL-6 gene transfer could significantly increase the expression of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and MHC-I molecule on tumor cells freshly isolated from the tumor mass. The NK and CTL activity of TIL increased markedly after the combined transfer of these two cytokine genes. We also observed the systemic antitumor immune response in the tumor-bearing mice and demonstrated that NK and CTL activity of splenocytes and the production of IL-2, tumor necrosis factor and interferon-gamma from splenocytes increased obviously in mice after the combined transfer of IL-2 and IL-6 gene. In conclusion, local and systemic antitumor immunity of the tumor-bearing host could be induced efficiently after the combined gene transfer.

Recently, it has been suggested that T cells that recognize stressed cells may play an important role in immune surveillance. We have examined the proliferative response of anti-CD3-activated TIL cultures from human tumors against heat-stressed (hs) (42.8 degrees C, 25 min) B cell lines (TK6 (HLA-DR7+, -DRw13+, -DRw52+, and -DRw53+) and JY (HLA-DR4+ and -DRw52+)) and the mutant cell line (T2 (no HLA-DR)) by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation. TIL lines from three of four ovarian cancers, two of four lung cancers, one of two renal cell cancers, one of two melanomas, and one of one breast cancer showed a positive proliferative response against hs-TK6 and/or hs-JY, but not against hs-T2. These TIL did not respond to autologous tumor cells. The response to hs-B cells was mediated by CD4+ TIL and inhibited by anti-HLA-DR Ab, but not by anti-HLA class I. Protein analysis revealed a significant increase of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) expression in hs-TK6 and hs-JY. In addition, the CD4+ TIL responded to TK6 that had been pulsed with hsp70. This response could be blocked by anti-HLA-DR Ab. The CD4+ TIL produced IFN-gamma, but not IL-4, in response to hs-TK6. From these results, we conclude that hsp70-reactive CD4+ T cells exist in tumor tissues. Furthermore, these TIL recognize stressed cells and seem to play a Th1-like role that may support antitumor T cell responses at local tumor sites.",

In IL-2-FuP-treated mice, the majority of draining LNCs and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes expressed T-cell activation markers and IL-2, thus being classified as T helper type 1 cells. These cells displayed strong proliferative activity and initiated activation of lymphokine-activated killer cells and CTLS: TNF-FuP supported activation of CTLs and of monocytes as revealed by TNF expression and cytostatic activity. Neither the antibody, nor IL-2, nor TNF, nor the mixture of antibody and cytokines exhibited the full-fledged activational potency of the FUPS: Notably, activation of immune effector mechanisms was much stronger when the FuPs were applied intratumorally. This is the first report to show that FuPs are efficient immunostimulants in vivo for native leukocytes.

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of tumor progression still remain obscure. As we know, tumor microenvironment that can directly influence tumor development and prognosis has attracted much attention of large number of immunologists. Accumulated evidence has suggested that tumor microenvironment is in a hypoxic condition, under which immune cells may exhibit distinct functions compared to those under normal oxygen tension. The article we propose here will offer a novel point of view for understanding tumor microenvironment in order to instruct clinical immunotherapy. Just like the pH buffer system in human body, interactions of immune cells in tumor microenvironment may also constitute a buffer system, the balance of which is of great importance during immunotherapy for tumors. However, many protocols for tumor immunotherapy in clinic at present have not taken it into account, so the therapeutic outcome is often disappointing. In the present study, we have demonstrated the effect of Corynebacterium parvum, a well known immune stimulator, on malignant melanoma. Cell ingredients in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and their anti-tumor effect have been altered when dosage of Corynebacterium parvum is changed. So, to obtain better therapeutic purposes, what we should do first is to detect an index to evaluate immune buffer capacity for the patient during tumor immunotherapy, then to choose appropriate drug doses to augment buffer capacity for their immune buffer system. Taken together, the hypothesis proposed here may help understand the pathogenesis of tumor progression and design more effective strategy for clinical immunotherapy for tumors.",

The obtaining of recombinant cytokine has facilitated the study of its biological properties and its application in the treatment of certain neoplastic and infectious diseases. IL-2 affects the target cells by means of a receptor of great affinity consisting of three independent chains: alpha, beta, gamma. The cytokine is the most important growth factor of lymphocytes T, conditioning their clonal expansion. Antigen stimulation is the condition for the expression of IL-2 does not, however, affect resting lymphocytes T. The expression of the receptor for this cytokine on NK cells is, however, continuous in character but only a very small percentage of these cells has receptors of great affinity. IL-2 plays a great role in adoptive immunotherapy consisting in intravenous administration of cells with cytotoxic properties. Cells obtained from peripheral blood and grown in vitro are called LAK cells (lymphocyte activated killer cells), while cells obtained from neoplasms and grown in similar conditions are named TIL cells (tumor infiltrated lymphocytes). LAK and TIL cells reveal a similar antineoplastic activity in vivo. At present, however, recombinant IL-2 alone is used more often, either intravenously or subcutaneously. The cytokine is effective in the treatment of patients with disseminate cancer of the kidney and melanoma, and in adjuvant therapy of acute myeloid leukemia. Attempts have been made to apply it in the treatment of AIDS and leprosy. The toxic effect of IL-2 depends on the dose and the mode of administration. In the majority of patients parainfluenza symptoms appear. Most undesirable effects are connected with multisystemic syndrome of capillary vessels hyperpermeability leading to the increased fluid retention into extravascular spaces, oedema, hypotonia and oliguria.",

While B7/BB1 is known as a major costimulatory molecule in the induction of T cell responses, its role in T cell recruitment and effector function is still unclear. In this study, we show that introducing a major costimulatory molecule B7/BB1 into a major histocompatibility complex class II-negative tumor cell line, J558, results in a drastic reduction of its tumorigenicity. The tumor rejection depends on CD8 T cells but not CD4 T cells. However, unlike the previous reports on melanoma cell lines, B7/BB1-transfected J558 cells fail to induce cross-protection against parental J558 cells. The B7/BB1-transfected (J558-B7), but not untransfected J558 cells (J558-Neo) induce a CD8 T cell-dominant inflammatory response, and the T cells isolated from the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are polyclonal in terms of their T cell receptor V beta usage. Most surprisingly, the freshly prepared TIL have a potent, CD8 T cell-mediated cytotoxicity on tumor cells without any in vitro stimulation. The cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity can be blocked by anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Interestingly, the CTL lyse J558-B7 about 10- to 80-fold more efficiently than untransfected J558-Neo cells. This preferential lysis cannot be attributed to recognition of B7/BB1-derived antigen by the T cells. This finding, together with the lack of the cross-protection between the J558-B7 and J558-Neo, suggests that B7/BB1 can also function at the effector phase of CTL responses. This notion is confirmed by our findings that the lysis of J558-B7 can be blocked by anti-B7 mAbs. Taken together, our results indicate that not only can the B7/BB1 molecule function as a costimulatory molecule at the initiation of immune response, it can also play a major role in T cell recruitment and effector function. This conclusion has significant implications for immunotherapy of tumors.",

No OX-40R(+) lymphocytes were noted in normal breast tissue. Twenty-one (43%) patients had axillary metastases at the time of resection. High levels of OX-40R expression was seen in 9 (45%) of these 21 axillary node specimens, whereas no such staining was seen in the node-negative specimens (P <0.001). Furthermore, in a patient thought to be without axillary disease, several subcapsular single-cell metastases were retrospectively discovered near a lone cluster of OX-40R(+) lymphocytes.

Furthermore, utilizing PCR, we have documented previously that V beta 2, V beta 3, V beta 6, and V beta 7 are represented in increased proportions in ovarian tumor-specific CTL lines. Therefore, to correlate the interaction of these specific TCR V beta segments with the HLA-A2 molecule and potential tumor-associated Ags (TAA) related to HER2/neu expression, we have utilized available mAbs to V beta 2, V beta 3, and V beta 6. We found that V beta 2+, V beta 3+, and V beta 6+ CTL mediate antitumor activity, and a combination of these mAbs resulted in 83 to 95% inhibition of the cytotoxicity against autologous tumor from three separate patients. These mAbs also were capable of blocking HLA-A2-matched allogeneic cytotoxicity, suggesting that all three V beta families recognize TAA in the context of HLA-A2. An HLA-A2+ melanoma was transfected with the HER2/neu gene and became sensitive to HLA-A2+ ovarian cancer-specific CTL lysis. This cytotoxicity was mediated by V beta 3+ and V beta 6+ CTL, as demonstrated by mAb-blocking studies. FACS-depletion studies confirmed that CTL populations depleted of V beta 3 or V beta 6 no longer could recognize the HER2/neu transfectant. We conclude that V beta 3 and V beta 6 recognize some TAA that are either derived from the HER2/neu protein or induced by the expression of the HER2/neu gene and presented in the context of HLA-A2.

        "Doc_abstract":"The rapid development of both knowledge and techniques in molecular biology have made it possible to engineer genetic constructs and transfer them into cells of individuals with various diseases. Such gene therapies may alleviate or perhaps even cure diseases for which no adequate treatment now exists. One potential application is to treat genetic disease by inserting a normal gene into cells in individuals with a \"malfunctioning\" gene. The added genetic information could allow these cells to function properly and might reduce or eliminate the sequelae of the disease. Such genetic manipulation could also be used to combat other diseases using the same general technique. For example in cancer patients, various cytokine genes inserted into tumor cells may serve as components of a tumor vaccine because such cytokine-secreting tumor cells can induce a significant T-cell response in experimental animal models when compared with non-gene-modified tumors, ultimately leading to a systemic immune response. In addition to treating patients, transferred genes also can serve as markers to obtain important information about the fate of otherwise indistinguishable cells. For example, we used a genetic marker to label tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to monitor their in vivo survival and ability to \"home\" to tumor sites. Gene markers also were transferred into autologous bone marrow cells to study the mechanism of tumor relapse. This review will focus primarily on studies using gene markers to track TILs after transfer. We will focus on the following issues: (a) that TILs are potent antitumor cells, mediating partial and complete responses in patients with melanoma; (b) the importance of the initial gene marked TIL study; (c) safety considerations in the use of gene marking/gene therapy; (d) results of gene-marked TIL studies; and (e) other gene-marked cells.",

The purpose of the present study was to examine the systemic and intra-tumor effects of in vivo T-cell activation with BsAb, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), and beta-glucan in combination with BsAb as a retargeting agent. CL-62 melanoma cells were injected subcutaneously into C3H/ HeN mice. Mice were subsequently treated with BsAb alone or with SEB or beta-glucan plus BsAb. Fresh splenocytes, lymph-node cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were tested for their proliferative response using incorporation of 3H-thymidine, and for their ability to lyse CL-62 cells in the presence or absence of BsAb in 4-hr 51Chromium release assays. Toxicity of treatments was assessed in a D-galactosamine model. BsAb, alone or combined with beta-glucan, had essentially no effect on systemic T-cell cytotoxicity, and essentially no effect on systemic proliferation, unless exogenous IL-2 was provided. At the tumor site, BsAb alone, BsAb plus beta-glucan, and SEB plus BsAb all significantly increased BsAb-mediated TIL cytotoxicity. In contrast to the TIL-limited effects of BsAb and of BsAb plus beta-glucan, SEB plus BsAb markedly increased both systemic and intra-tumor T-lymphocyte activation. Toxicity correlated with measures of systemic activation, with limited effects from BsAb alone and from beta-glucan plus BsAb, and with marked lethality from SEB plus BsAb. Overall, these results suggest moderate intra-tumor activation of TIL, but no measurable systemic activation after in vivo treatment with BsAb or beta-glucan plus BsAb. SEB plus BsAb results in complete T-cell activation in both systemic and intra-tumor compartments, but at the expense of increased systemic toxicity. In conclusion, TIL can be activated in situ with different combinations of in vivo activants. In vivo-activated TIL can be retargeted with bispecific antibodies to lyse tumor cells, and may be an alternative to ex vivo T-cell activation and adoptive transfer therapy.",

After almost one century of considering this phenomenon as a sort of neglected curiosity, some recent studies have first proposed tumor cell cannibalism as a sort of \"aberrant phagocytosis\", making malignant cells very similar to professional phagocytes. Later, further research has shown that, differently to macrophages, exclusively ingesting exogenous material, apoptotic bodies, or cell debris, tumor cells are able to engulf other cells, including lymphocytes and erythrocytes, either dead or alive, with the main purpose to feed on them. This phenomenon has been associated to the malignancy of tumors, mostly exclusive of metastatic cells, and often associated to poor prognosis. The cannibalistic behavior increased depending on the microenvironmental condition of tumor cells, such as low nutrient supply or low pH, suggesting its key survival option for malignant cancers. However, the evidence that malignant cells may cannibalize tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that act as their killers, suggests that tumor cell cannibalism could be a very direct and efficient way to neutralize immune response, as well. Tumor cell cannibalism may represent a sign of regression to a simpler, ancestral or primeval life style, similar to that of unicellular microorganisms, such as amoebas, where the goal is to survive and propagate in an overcrowded and very hostile microenvironment. In fact, we discovered that metastatic melanoma cells share with amoebas a transmembrane protein TM9SF4, indeed related to the cannibal behavior of these cells. This review attempts to provide a comprehensive description of the current knowledge about the role of TM9SF4 in cancer, highlighting its role as a key player in the cannibal behavior of malignant cancer cells. Moreover, we discuss differences and similarities between tumor cannibalism, entosis, phagocytosis and emperipolesis. ",

Enhanced expression of MHC correlated with decreased target susceptibility to lysis by fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and IL-2-augmented PBMCs (aPBL) but not as clearly with cells with lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) activity. These studies revealed maximal MHC enhancement after 48-72 h of incubation in IFN. Resistance to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells was best demonstrated after 72 h. Further, IFN and TNF were synergistic in their effects on MHC expression and induction of resistance of the cultured leukemias K562 and Molt-4 to aPBL effectors. Conversely, LAK susceptibility was usually unaltered after target IFN and TNF treatment. Incubation of fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells with IFN also consistently resulted in MHC class I enhancement and resistance to NK lysis, whereas LAK susceptibility was variably affected. The brief incubation of fresh PBL in IL-2 (4-6 h) resulted in effectors highly lytic toward cultured cells, but with no activity against fresh tumor. Cultured cell lines treated with IFN and TNF were rendered relatively resistant to lysis by these activated cells. Fresh tumor MHC expression and LAK susceptibility was unchanged after IFN incubation. Additionally, there was no correlation between the level of MHC class I or class II expression and LAK susceptibility to any fresh, uncultured melanoma studied. These data suggest that LAK effectors possess different mechanisms of tumor recognition or lysis than cells with NK activity or cells briefly incubated (4-6 h) in IL-2. The ability of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to lyse the cultured autologous tumor target was markedly increased by preincubation of the targets with IFN and TNF. Finally, it appears that IL-2 treatment and the resultant endogenous production of IFN by T-lymphocytes should not adversely affect tumor susceptibility to current immunotherapy using IL-2.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Adoptive immunotherapy of malignancy involves the passive transfer of antitumor-reactive cells into a host in order to mediate tumor regression. Based on animal models, the transfer of immune lymphoid cells can eradicate widely disseminated tumors and establish long-term systemic immunity. Critical for successful adoptive immunotherapy is the ability to isolate large numbers of immune cells. For clinical therapy, it will require the development on in vitro methods to promote the sensitization and propagation of tumor-reactive cells. However, this is a formidable task since human cancers are postulated to be poorly immunogenic because of their spontaneous origins.;Human lymphoid cells for ex vivo activation and subsequent adoptive transfer have been derived from different sources, including peripheral blood, tumor, and lymph nodes. Peripheral blood lymphocytes can be incubated with interleukin 2 to generate lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, which nonspecifically lyse autologous and allogeneic tumor cells in vitro. LAK cell therapy represented the earliest attempt to treat advanced human cancers, with encouraging results documented in patients with renal cell cancer and melanoma. From that experience, the use of more immunologically specific cellular agents with potentially greater therapeutic efficacy has been investigated. One approach uses tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, which have been characterized experimentally to be more specific in tumor reactivity compared with LAK cells. Other techniques have involved the use of lymphoid cells derived from lymph nodes draining tumors or primed by tumor vaccines. In vitro activation of these cells with tumor antigen or anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody results in the generation of T cells that mediate the rejection of poorly immunogenic tumors in animal studies. These alternate methods are currently being evaluated in clinical studies.;Experimentally, cellular therapy is a potent method to eradicate progressive tumors. Initial clinical studies have demonstrated that this form of therapy is technically feasible and can result in meaningful antitumor responses. Advances in this area will require improved methods to sensitize, isolate, and expand tumor-reactive T cells for adoptive transfer.",

The five most prevalent tumor types from which TIL were successfully initiated were melanoma (25 successful initiates in 34 tumor samples, 74% success rate), colorectal cancer (12 of 18, 67%), renal cell carcinoma (9 of 12, 75%), breast (4 of 5, 80%), and sarcoma (5 of 7, 71%). The overall success rate for all tumors was 67 of 94 (71%). There were no instances of contamination from the time of culture initiation through harvesting of the final cell product for clinical use. The mean number of days to reach successful initiation (> 5 x 10(8) cells) was 35 +/- 24 days (mean +/- SD). TIL were then expanded from these successful initiates for either a repeated low-dose therapy (TIL reinfusion numbers of 5 x 10(8)-5 x 10(9) or for a repeated high-dose therapy (> 5 x 10(9)-5 x 10(10). The mean number of days to expand a TIL culture from the time of initiation to treatment for a first low-dose TIL was 59 days (range, 27-94 days) compared with 80 days (range, 33-209 days) for high-dose TIL. For patients who received a second or third high-dose TIL treatment, the average number of days needed to expand TIL was 39 days (n = 10) if there was no intervening cryopreservation of TIL, compared with 49 days (n = 10) if the culture had to be reestablished from cryopreserved TIL. For patients who received a second or third low-dose TIL, the mean number of days needed to expand TIL was 23 days (n = 3) if there was no intervening cryopreservation compared with 42 days (n = 17) if cultures had to be reestablished after cryopreservation of TIL. Low-dose TIL displayed predominantly CD4+ phenotype in 76% of 42 cultures, whereas high-dose TIL displayed predominantly CD8+ phenotype in 84% of 44 cultures. Cells bearing the natural killer (NK) phenotype (CD3-, CD56+) and the lymphokine activated killer (LAK) phenotype (CD3+, CD56+) were present in both low- and high-dose TIL cultures, but these phenotypes were never predominant. Cytotoxicity testing consistently demonstrated the persistence of NK and LAK activity in addition to the killing of allogeneic and autologous melanoma tumor targets. This work confirms that TIL cultures from most tumor types can be successfully established and expanded for therapeutic use, and repeated expansion from continuous TIL culture or cryopreserved TIL for repeated treatments is feasible. Such cultures are predominantly T lymphocytes that are phenotypically heterogeneous, and these phenotypes do not remain constant during prolonged time in culture.",

Therefore, we sought to determine the effect of IL-4 on the growth of human squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) cell lines. Growth of SCCHN cell lines incubated in the presence of various concentrations of IL-4 was measured in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide colorimetric assays and by cell counts. Specific binding of IL-4 to SCCHN cells was demonstrated by flow cytometry with phycoerythrin-labeled IL-4, blocking studies with antibodies to IL-4, and using the radiolabeled ligand 125I-labeled IL-4. Reverse transcription PCR for IL-4 and IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) mRNA was performed. SCCHN tissue biopsies were examined by immunohistology and in situ hybridization for the presence of IL-4 protein and IL-4 mRNA in the tumor, respectively. In contrast to earlier reports, we observed growth stimulatory effects of IL-4 consistently in 6 of 13 SCCHN cell lines tested. Growth stimulation by IL-4 ranged from 20 to 200% of control (P < 0.05) and was IL-4 dose dependent. The growth-promoting effect of IL-4 was inhibited completely by incubation of tumor cells in the presence of antibodies specific for IL-4. Reverse transcription PCR analysis of mRNA obtained from the SCCHN cell lines and ELISA performed with SCCHN cell supernatants respectively indicated that the tumor cells did not transcribe or secrete IL-4 actively. The SCCHN cell lines expressed 260-540 IL-4Rs/cell with a dissociation constant of 100 +/- 8 pM. SCCHN cell lines also contained IL-4R mRNA. Immunostaining of SCCHN tissue biopsies indicated that IL-4 may be produced and secreted within these tumors by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. In situ hybridization for IL-4 mRNA indicated the presence of positive cells in the tumor stroma. Our data suggest that IL-4 may regulate the growth of SCCHN cells by a paracrine mechanism. These data also indicate that immunotherapy with exogenous IL-4 or IL-4 gene therapy to treat head and neck cancer may not be effective, given the potential tumor growth-stimulatory effects of this cytokine.",

This paper (Study #2) is an update of our experience through 1999 in the production of tumor-derived activated cells (TDAC), also called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), from tumor biopsies. TDAC were successfully grown in medium containing Interleukin-2 from 75% of the 366 tumor biopsies tested. There was no significant difference in success (growth to 1 x 10(9) cells) comparing primary and metastatic tumors. Many of the tumors were shipped to the laboratory by overnight delivery from distant sites. Success rate did decrease with the length of time for tumor transport in excess of 24 hours. Certain additional cytokines were tested when cultures did not grow. Interleukin-4 was beneficial in the development of 1 of 4 TDAC cultures which did not grow with IL-2 alone. In order to produce TDAC to treat patients, cells were grown in gas permeable plastic bags or in artificial capillary bioreactor cultures. Approximately 1 x 10(9) were seeded from an initially successful \"feasibility study\" to bulk produce cells for treatment. Harvest was carried out after about 3 weeks. Sixty-three patients were treated at least once with a minimum of 1 x 10(10) TDAC given by intravenous infusion. On the average, the number of cells per treatment was 3 x 10(10) with a viability of 87%. TDAC cultures contained T cells with variable ratios of CD4 to CD8 cells. Secreted granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor, interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha were measured in TDAC conditioned medium. Only 34 patients received the full course of 4 TDAC treatments. The cells were well tolerated with mild fever and dyspnea. Partial responses were observed in 8 patients, including the dramatic regression of scalp nodules in a patient with renal cancer. These results showed that therapeutic amounts of TDAC can be produced in cell culture in a reasonable and cost-effective manner. The cells were well tolerated and responses were seen in renal and melanoma patients resistant to IL-2 with bulky, advanced cancer.",

To characterize further the fate of adoptively transferred TILs, the uptake of the thymidine analog 5-[125I]iodo-2-deoxyuridine ([125I]UdR) into the DNA of dividing cells was used to study the in vivo proliferation and migration patterns of transferred TILs in C57BL/6N mice. Animals received 500 rad of total body irradiation prior to cell transfer to separate incorporation of radiolabel into endogenous lymphoid cells from that into transferred TILs. Mice were subsequently treated with i.v. injections of TILs or no cells followed by i.p. injections of Hanks' balanced salt solution or IL-2. At various time points, mice received [125I]UdR, and 20 h later tissues were removed and counted on a gamma analyzer. A proliferation index (PI) was calculated by dividing the mean cpm of organs of experimentally treated mice by the mean cpm of organs of control mice. Animals receiving TILs alone demonstrated small increases in [125I]UdR in the lungs, liver, and spleen of saline-treated controls (PI = 1.4, 1.6, and 1.7, respectively, on day 4), while animals treated with 50,000 U of IL-2 alone showed greater increases in the lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen (PI = 3.9, 6.1, 3.3, and 15.8). Mice receiving TILs plus IL-2 demonstrated the highest levels of radiolabel incorporation in the same organs (PI = 10.5, 19.4, 10.2, and 22.4). Over a period of 10 days, TIL plus IL-2 treated animals continued to incorporate significantly greater amounts of [125I]UdR for as long as high-dose IL-2 was administered. Animals treated with TILs demonstrated increased incorporation of radiolabel with increasing doses of IL-2. Injection of irradiated TILs did not result in an increased uptake of [125I]UdR into these tissues, thus confirming that TIL proliferation is responsible for the radiolabel uptake in animals receiving TILs alone or TILs plus IL-2. Additionally, fluorescein-labeled anti-Thy-1.1 antibody identified proliferating TILs derived from congenic B6.PL Thy 1a/CY (Thy-1.1) animals in the lungs, spleen, and liver of recipient C57BL/6N (Thy 1.2) mice. In summary, we have demonstrated that adoptively transferred TILs distribute widely after i.v. injection and can proliferate in various tissues especially under the influence of exogenous IL-2.",
