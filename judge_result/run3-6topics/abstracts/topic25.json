        "Doc_abstract":"Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a prognostic factor for patients with stage IV melanoma. To gain insights into the biology underlying this prognostic factor, we analyzed total serum LDH, serum LDH isoenzymes, and serum lactate in up to 49 patients with metastatic melanoma. Our data demonstrate that high serum LDH is associated with a significant increase in LDH isoenzymes 3 and 4, and a decrease in LDH isoenzymes 1 and 2. Since LDH isoenzymes play a role in both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), we subsequently determined using tissue microarray (TMA) analysis that the levels of proteins associated with mitochondrial function, lactate metabolism, and regulators of glycolysis were all elevated in advanced melanomas compared with nevic melanocytes. To investigate whether in advanced melanoma, the glycolysis and OXPHOS pathways might be linked, we determined expression of the monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) 1 and 4. Analysis of a nevus-to-melanoma progression TMA revealed that MCT4, and to a lesser extend MCT1, were elevated with progression to advanced melanoma. Further analysis of human melanoma specimens using the Seahorse XF24 extracellular flux analyzer indicated that metastatic melanoma tumors derived a large fraction of energy from OXPHOS. Taken together, these findings suggest that in stage IV melanomas with normal serum LDH, glycolysis and OXPHOS may provide metabolic symbiosis within the same tumor, whereas in stage IV melanomas with high serum LDH glycolysis is the principle source of energy.",

LDH was defined as the most important serum parameter in disseminated melanoma. The aim of the present study was to compare the prognostic values of serum 5-S-Cysteinyldopa, S-100B and LDH concentrations in Stage III-IV melanoma patients. Serum samples were taken from 179 Stage III-IV melanoma patients at diagnosis. Serum 5-S-CD concentrations were determined by HPLC, S-100B protein by immunoluminometric assay while LDH by UV kinetic method. The mean/median concentrations of LDH, S-100B protein and 5-S-CD in Stage III patients ranged around the normal level. In Stage IV, the markers ranked as S100B = 5-S-CD > LDH for sensitivity, S-100B > LDH > 5-S-CD for specificity and LDH = S100B = 5-S-CD for positive predictive value, respectively. Furthermore, mean marker concentrations of patients with progressive disease differed significantly from nonprogresssive cases (when staging categories have been disregarded). Survival analysis indicated, that the initially elevated LDH and S-100B level in Stage IV disease predicts comparably short survival. Results of our study suggest that these serum marker values correlate well with Stages and disease progression. In Stage IV melanoma, the markers had appropriate sensitivity, high specificity as well as important positive predictive value. Among the studied serum markers S-100B protein and LDH proved to be similarly reliable in respect to the clinical outcome.",

A high expression of the oncoprotein c-Met in primary uveal melanoma is associated with metastatic progression, and c-Met is released as a soluble ectodomain through ADAM10- and ADAM17-mediated cleavage, suggesting a possible role as biomarker.;To determine the potential role of soluble c-Met (sc-Met) as a biomarker of uveal melanoma progression in comparison with S100 and LDH.;Soluble c-Met was studied in the conditioned medium of 9 uveal melanoma cell lines and in the blood serum samples of 24 mice with uveal melanoma xenografts, 57 patients with uveal melanoma (17 patients whose tumors metastasized and 40 patients whose tumors did not metastasize), and 37 healthy donors. We collected blood samples for as long as 5 years after treatment of the primary tumor.

This study was designed to detect and evaluate whether the expression of VEGFR-3 or its soluble form plays a role in metastatic malignant melanoma and to determine the relationship with clinicopathological parameters and patients outcome.;VEGFR-3 expression on melanoma tumour was evaluated by immunohistochemical study. Using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, sVEGFR-3 was measured in sera of 60 metastatic melanoma patients in comparison with 30 healthy controls.;Immunohistochemical study demonstrated a high expression of VEGFR-3 in melanoma cells. Median level of pre-treatment sVEGFR-3 was significantly higher (p=0.00001) in melanoma patients as compared to healthy donors. No association was noted between VEGFR-3 in situ or in sera and gender, age or LDH level. Median serum VEGFR-3 levels were significantly higher in patients with high tumour burden as compared to those with low tumour burden (p=0.013) as well as in non-responding patients (n=33) as compared to responding ones (n=27). Finally, low level of VEGFR-3 was also related positively to disease free survival (X(2)=3.85, p=0.022).;These results suggest that the expression and high pre-treatment sVEGFR-3 level are significantly correlated to poorer prognosis, and may be promising targets for new therapeutic strategies in melanoma disease.",

We assessed whether serum MMP-8 is of prognostic value in malignant melanoma. We studied serum samples of 117 patients, of which 63 were stage I, 13 stage II, 12 stage III and 29 stage IV.

Tendency to increased serum MMP-8 levels in patients with coronary heart disease or type II diabetes mellitus was detected.

In current study, we have evaluated whether LDH(R1) as DNA vaccine delivery carrier can augment the efficacy of DNA vaccine immunization in vivo. Firstly, we found that LDH(R1) was efficient in combining DNA and formed LDH(R1)/DNA complex with an average diameter of about 80-120 nm. Its high transfection efficiency in vivo delivered with a GFP expression plasmid was also observed. After delivery of pcDNA(3)-OVA/LDH(R1) complex by intradermal immunization in C57BL/6 mice, the LDH(R1) induced an enhanced serum antibody response much greater than naked DNA vaccine. Using B16-OVA melanoma as tumor model, we demonstrated that pcDNA(3)-OVA/LDH(R1) complex enhanced immune priming and protection from tumor challenge in vivo. Furthermore, we showed that LDH(R1) induced dramatically more effective CTL activation and skewed T helper polarization to Th1.

In the hybrid cells, under conditions of growth arrest in medium with low serum, ribosomal protein S6 was rapidly phosphorylated in response to insulin or serum. The phosphorylation of the S6 protein increased over a wide range of insulin concentrations, suggesting that insulin stimulated the phosphorylation by interacting with both high- and low-affinity receptors. In contrast, in growth-arrested melanoma cells, an intermediate level of S6 phosphorylation was observed. Insulin caused only a marginal increase and serum caused a small but consistent increase in the level of S6 phosphorylation in the melanoma cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that both cell lines arrested growth to a similar degree in the G1 phase of the cell cycle; thus, the higher baseline level of S6 phosphorylation observed in the melanoma cells was not attributable to less complete growth arrest of these cells in medium with low serum. The S6 phosphorylation results correlate well with previous results suggesting that the hybrid cells, but not the parental melanoma cells, can become growth-limited for processes regulated by insulin.",

The aim of this work was to discover serum biomarkers in patients diagnosed with primary melanoma that identify those at a high risk of developing metastasis during the follow-up period. Proteomic and mass spectrophotometry analysis was performed on serum obtained from patients who developed metastasis during the first years after surgery for primary tumors and compared with that from patients who remained disease-free for more than 10 years after surgery. Five proteins were selected for validation as prognostic factors in 348 melanoma patients and 100 controls by ELISA: serum amyloid A and clusterin; immune system proteins; the cell adhesion molecules plakoglobin and vitronectin and the antimicrobial protein dermcidin. Compared to healthy controls, melanoma patients have high serum levels of these proteins at the moment of melanoma diagnosis, although the specific values were not related to the histopathological stage of the tumors. However, an analysis based on classification together with multivariate statistics showed that tumor stage, vitronectin and dermcidin levels were associated with the metastatic progression of patients with early-stage melanoma.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) catalyzes the reduction of pyruvate to form lactate, and serum level is often raised in aggressive cancer and hematological malignancies. We have assessed the prognostic value of LDH in solid tumors.;A systematic review of electronic databases was conducted to identify publications exploring the association of LDH with clinical outcome in solid tumors. Overall survival (OS) was the primary outcome, and cancer-specific survival (CSS), progression-free survival (PFS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were secondary outcomes. Data from studies reporting a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were pooled in a meta-analysis. Pooled HRs were computed and weighted using generic inverse-variance and random-effect modeling. All statistical tests were two-sided.;Seventy-six studies comprising 22 882 patients, mainly with advanced disease, were included in the analysis. Median cut-off of serum LDH was 245 U/L. Overall, higher LDH levels were associated with a HR for OS of 1.7 (95% CI 1.62-1.79; p < 0.00001) in 73 studies. The prognostic effect was highest in renal cell, melanoma, gastric, prostate, nasopharyngeal and lung cancers (all p < 0.00001).

We have previously demonstrated that the protein melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) is involved in the metastasis of and immunosuppression in malignant melanoma. Recently, we further established MIA as a therapeutic target to inhibit metastatic spread in malignant melanoma. We could show that an inhibition of MIA by a synthetic peptide decreased both the number of metastases as well as immunosuppression in a murine model of malignant melanoma. To control recurrence after surgical resection of a primary lesion, it is paramount to have diagnostic tools available that can detect a relapse due to the strong metastatic potential of melanoma. This follow-up is maintained with periodic re-examinations. Due to high cost and the associated radiation exposure, radiology examinations are avoided if possible. The analysis of prognostic markers in patient serum is therefore attractive. In this review, we focus on the quantitative analysis of the MIA protein as a prognostic tool because it has proven to be a useful serum marker for documenting disease progression of malignant melanoma. The MIA quantification assay itself is readily performed using an ELISA kit and common laboratory equipment. Because analysing MIA serum levels in combination with other established markers such as S100B improves their prognostic value, we feel that the quantification of MIA in the serum, among other markers, should be performed as a general standard of care in patients at risk of developing metastatic melanoma.

Our hypothesis was that MIA serum level will be elevated in patients with metastases or local spreading of the disease before any symptom of such progression is clinically apparent. We compared MIA serum levels in two groups of patients with primary melanoma; those with positive as opposed to those with negative sentinel lymph nodes. In addition, MIA serum levels were studied in two control groups; patients with dysplastic nevi and patients with basal cell carcinoma. A blood sample was obtained from each patient included in the study and MIA levels were assessed using standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Patients with histologically positive sentinel lymph nodes, meaning that tumor cells were found in the lymph nodes, had much higher mean MIA values than any other patient group considered in this study. With mean value of 14.53 ng/ml, it was almost twice as high as mean MIA value in patients with histologically negative sentinel lymph nodes (7.32 ng/ml) and more than twice as high than any of the two control groups (P<0.001). However, neither the classification by Clarke nor the classification by Breslow could be used to distinguish patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes from those with negative sentinel lymph nodes.

The level of antityrosinase antibodies in patients with metastatic melanoma was significantly higher than the level in healthy subjects, but insignificantly higher than the level in patients with no evidence of disease. Patients with melanoma and MAH (melanoma-associated hypopigmentation; vitiligo-like) had the same level of antityrosinase antibodies as the controls or the patients with metastatic melanoma. This observation reflected the possible absorption of antityrosinase antibodies by melanoma antigens, and pointed to the participation of the antibodies in the destruction of normal melanocytes in patients with melanoma, as part of the immune reaction towards this disease. The most interesting observation was the high level of antityrosinase antibodies in patients with vitiligo in comparison with the low level in patients with melanoma, patients with MAH, and patients with NED. Although the cutaneous manifestations of vitiligo and MAH are similar and result from destruction of melanocytes by specific antibodies, the two situations are immunologically different. The serum level of free antityrosinase antibodies could not serve as marker for the state of the disease or disease progression or relapse, as no significant difference could be detected between the levels in patients without evidence of disease to those with metastatic melanoma; nor could the levels of antityrosinase antibodies differentiate between the different sites of the primary lesion.

In this study, we evaluated the possible relationship between serum IL-6 level and overall survival. This retrospective study included 125 patients with MMM. Pretreatment serum IL-6 levels were determined using a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test.

Thirty-five patients were in the low IL-6 group and 76 patients were in the high IL-6 group. Based on this stratification, overall survival was shown to be affected by IL-6 serum level: it was higher (24.6 months) in the low IL-6 group when compared with the high IL-6 group (9.7 months) (P=0.0006).

Although the prognosis for melanoma based on stage is generally good, the disease identified at later stages is associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. The value of MIA testing in early-stage melanoma was the goal of this study. Five thousand three hundred and thirty-four MIA serum values from 1079 consecutive melanoma patients in stages I and II were obtained during routine follow-up at scheduled intervals. Sensitivity and specificity of MIA were calculated. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve and Somers' Dxy rank correlation were assessed. Metastasis occurred in 137 patients with a sensitivity of MIA testing of 67.6% in stage I and 65.6% in stage II patients. The specificity was 76.9% for stage I and 66.7% for stage II patients. The most reliable normal upper limit for MIA was redefined at 12.0 ng/ml, when compared with 8.8 and 15.0 ng/ml. Multivariate analysis revealed significantly more frequent false-positive values in elderly women and in men with an increased Breslow thickness.MIA adapted with a new cut-off level is then a useful serum marker even in the follow-up of not yet relapsed early-stage melanoma patients.

        "Doc_abstract":"Tyrosinase is an enzyme that participates in the process of melanin production in normal melanocytes and melanoma cells. Enzymes are known to be autoantigens in various autoimmune disorders; thus, after the detection of antityrosinase antibodies in patients with vitiligo and melanoma, tyrosinase was defined as an autoantigen in these conditions. In some patients with melanoma the disease is associated with the appearance of \"vitiligo-like\" white patches on the skin, called melanoma-associated hypopigmentation (MAH). In this article, the authors summarize the recent data related to antityrosinase antibodies and expand on their role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo, melanoma, and MAH. In addition, the beneficial clinical applications of antityrosinase antibodies are presented.;An enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay to detect the antityrosinase antibodies in the serum of patients and healthy volunteers was established using mushroom tyrosinase. Employing this method, antityrosinase antibodies were analyzed in a diverse group of patients with melanoma and vitiligo and in mice immunized with tyrosinase.;In patients with melanoma, those with metastatic disease had a higher titer of antityrosinase antibodies compared with healthy subjects, whereas patients with MAH and those with no evidence of disease had similar titers to the control group. The titer of antityrosinase antibodies in patients with metastatic melanoma treated by vaccination with antiidiotypic antibodies mimicking the high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW MAA) initially increased after the vaccination and then decreased. High titers of antityrosinase antibodies were detected in patients with diffuse vitiligo compared with patients with localized disease and with the healthy control group. Mice immunized with tyrosinase generated a high titer of antityrosinase antibodies and after the inoculation of melanoma cells developed a lower number of lung metastases compared with an unvaccinated control group.;The appearance of antityrosinase autoantibodies in the serum of patients with metastatic melanoma and diffuse vitiligo is characterized by these two pathologies. The changes in the serum level of these autoantibodies in patients with melanoma after immunization with another antigen (HMW MAA) may have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

Stable EGF knockdown (EGFkd) in EGF-high (M24met) and EGF-low (A375) expressing melanoma cells was generated. Only in EGF-high melanoma cells, EGFkd led to a significant reduction of lymph node metastasis and primary tumor lymphangiogenesis in vivo, as well as impairment of tumor cell migration in vitro. Moreover, EGF-induced sprouting of lymphatic but not of blood endothelial cells was abolished using supernatants of M24met EGFkd cells. In addition, M24met EGFkd tumors showed reduced vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) expression levels. Similarly, in human primary melanomas, a direct correlation between EGF/VEGF-C and EGF/Prox-1 expression levels was found. Finally, melanoma patients with lymph node micrometastases undergoing sentinel node biopsy were found to have significantly elevated EGF serum levels as compared with sentinel lymph node-negative patients.

Immunohistochemical detection of S100B protein is an acknowledged method for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma, and it has been suggested that rising serum levels of S100B protein are associated with the survival rate of patients with malignant melanoma. In the present study serum levels of S100B protein and urinary concentrations of 5-S-cysteinyldopa and 6-hydroxy-5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid were measured in 91 patients with histopathologically verified malignant melanoma. At the time of sampling 13 patients were in clinical stage I, 13 in stage II and 65 in stage III. The urinary levels of the melanin metabolites were determined by automated high performance liquid chromatography, and the serum levels of S100B protein by an immunoradiometric assay with two monoclonal antibodies. The overall survival rate was most strongly associated with the serum levels of S100B protein (P < 0.001), but there was also a significant correlation to urinary levels of 5-S-cysteinyldopa (P < 0.001). A corresponding association with urinary levels of 6-hydroxy-5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid was found in only a very few patients with extremely high urinary concentrations. A statistically significant increase in relative hazard was found for S100B protein levels exceeding 0.6 microgram/l (P < 0.001), and predictably for patients in clinical stage III (P < 0.001). An analysis of S100B protein levels in patients in clinical stage III showed a significant correlation to survival (P = 0.005).

In addition, common predictive serum biomarkers--lactate dehydrogenase, S100B and melanoma-inhibiting activity--as well as selected investigational serum biomarkers such as TA90IC and YKL-40 are also reviewed.

Interferon alpha (IFN-α) has been tested as adjuvant immunotherapy in high-risk melanoma patients in a number of studies, but its beneficial role is controversial. Although IFN-α treatment can prolong relapse-free survival, the effect on overall survival is not significant. However, a small subset of patients benefits from the treatment, signifying the need for biomarkers able to identify a responding subgroup. Here we evaluated whether serum osteopontin (OPN) could function as a biomarker identifying patients with poor prognosis that might benefit from IFN-α. The choice of osteopontin was based on the knowledge about the dual role of this protein in cancer and immune response, an apparent association between OPN and IFN signaling and a prognostic value of OPN in multiple other tumor types. Serum samples from 275 high-risk melanoma patients enrolled in the Nordic Adjuvant IFN Melanoma trial were analyzed for circulating OPN concentrations and OPN promoter polymorphisms in position -443. The potential relation between serum OPN levels, the genotypes and survival in non-treated patients and patients receiving adjuvant IFN-α was investigated. Although slightly better survival was observed in the treated patients that had high levels of OPN, the difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, serum OPN (its level or the genotype) cannot distinguish melanoma patients with poor prognosis, or patients that might benefit from adjuvant treatment with IFN-α. ",

We analysed a total of 1073 patients, with a mean age of 56.7 years. Men and women experienced similar prevalence, and 91.2% of patients had white skin. The most prevalent subtype was superficial spreading, and the most prevalent anatomic location was the trunk (32.2%), followed by the lower extremities (28%). Of all cases, 567 (52.9%) were assigned to clinical stages I and II, while 382 (32.6%) were stages III and IV. Surgery was the main treatment. Sentinel node biopsy was performed in 373 patients, with 23.8% positivity. Overall actuarial 5-year survival was 67.6%. Multivariate analysis showed that gender, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at diagnosis; anatomic location, TNM stage, and local recurrence were significant prognostic factors.;Overall survival was lower than worldwide rates. The main factors influencing survival were similar to those in other populations. Local recurrence was independently associated with lower survival rates.

The specificity of the reactions was analyzed by absorption experiments using 12 melanoma sera selected for their high binding activity. Pools of human erythrocytes or leukocytes did not remove, except in 1 case respectively, the activity of the sera, suggesting that it was not directed against alloantigens. Quantitative absorption experiments were done with the 2 melanoma lines and with 1 colon carcinoma line. The results, evaluated on the basis of absorption capacity per cell, indicate that the 2 melanoma lines had a similar amount of shared antigens, whereas the colon line was also effective in absorbing out the serum activity, but less frequently and less efficiently. Further experiments performed to analyze the influence of culturing the target cells in presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS), showed that the activity of sera was removed, at various degrees for different sera, by absorption with free FBS, with FBS coupled to Sepharose 4B, and with normal leukocytes cultured overnight with 10% FBS.

The mean serum angiogenin level was 270 ng/ml and the median 236 ng/ml (STD 163 ng/ml). Concentrations were significantly higher among men than in women (P = 0.031), whereas patient's age, site of the primary tumour, Clark's or Breslow's classifications were not associated with angiogenin levels. Patients with only lymph node metastases had markedly lower angiogenin levels than those with metastases at other sites (P = 0.05). High angiogenin levels were significantly (P = 0.015; Kruskal-Wallis) associated with poor treatment response with chemoimmunotherapy. Treatment-related survival (TRS) was shorter (10 months) in patients with above-median values than in those with below-median levels (19 months, P = NS).

The baseline median serum IL-6 level was 16.5 pg/ml. When disease progression was observed, an increase in serum IL-6 level was noted. In order to establish the possible relationship between IL-6 level and TTP, patients were divided into two groups (low and high) using the median IL-6 level (16.5 pg/ml) detected in the pretreatment serum of overall patients as a cut-off. Sixty patients were in the low IL-6 group and 56 patients in the high IL-6 group. Time to progression was calculated from the beginning of treatment to recurrence, and analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients with low IL-6 serum concentration showed a significantly (p<0.00001) higher median TTP than patients with high IL-6 level. Patients maintaining a low IL-6 level during the treatment showed the longest median TTP compared with those supporting high levels (24.4 versus 5.5 months). Taken together, our results showed that serum IL-6 level could be considered a predictive marker of recurrent disease in metastatic malignant melanoma.",

Using subtraction hybridization, cDNAs were identified that display enhanced expression in terminally differentiated and growth arrested human melanoma cells (Jiang and Fisher, 1993; Jiang et al., 1994a). A specific melanoma differentiation-associated (mda) cDNA, mda-6, is described whose expression inversely correlates with melanoma progression and growth. mda-6 is identical to WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 that encodes the M(r) 21,000 protein (p21) that is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Actively growing normal melanocyte, SV40-immortalized human melanocyte and dysplastic nevus cell lines synthesize elevated levels of mda-6 mRNA; whereas, actively proliferating radial and early vertical growth phase primary melanomas as well as metastatic human melanoma cells produce reduced levels of mda-6 mRNA. Treatment of primary and metastatic human melanoma cells with IFN-beta + MEZ results in growth inhibition and an increase in mda-6 expression. mda-6 expression also increases when human melanoma cells are grown to high saturation densities or when grown in serum-free medium. Using anti-p53 and anti-p21 antibodies, an inverse correlation is found between p53 and p21 protein levels during growth arrest and differentiation. Induction of growth arrest and terminal differentiation in H0-1 human melanoma cells by IFN-beta + MEZ results in a temporal decrease in wild-type p53 protein levels with a corresponding increase in p21 levels. In the Matrigel-assisted melanoma progression model, mda-6 expression decreases in early vertical growth phase primary human melanoma cells selected for autonomous or enhanced tumor formation in nude mice. In metastatic human melanoma cells displaying a loss of metastatic potential resulting from introduction of a normal human chromosome 6, mda-6 mRNA levels increase. Taken together, these studies indicate that mda-6 (p21) may function as a negative regulator of melanoma growth, progression and metastasis.",

The first study evaluated the levels of Vitamin D at time of melanoma diagnosis and the second one analyzed the association between VDR genetic variants and risk of having a high nevus number, the strongest phenotypic risk factor for melanoma.;The levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in 81 melanoma patients at diagnosis were measured. In a second group of melanoma patients, including 150 with low and 113 with high nevus number, 11 VDR SNPs were analyzed for their association with nevus number.;In the first study, 68% of patients had insufficient levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (<25 ng/ml). Autumn-winter months and fair phototype were associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 insufficiency; after multivariate analysis, season of sampling remained the only independent predictor of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels. In the second study, VDR variant rs2189480 (P = 0.006) was associated with risk of high nevus number whereas rs2239179 (P = 0.044) and rs7975128 (P = 0.0005) were protective against high nevus number. After Bonferroni adjustment only rs7975128 remained significant.

We have recently reported that mRNA for IL-10 was present in most metastatic melanoma tissues. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether melanoma metastases produce IL-10 protein. Single-cell suspensions were prepared by enzymatic dissociation of 28 lymph node metastases and 7 s.c. metastases and cryopreserved. Of these 35 samples, 30 produced IL-10 after a 24-h incubation (median, 125.1 pg/ml). IL-10 production was slightly diminished after 25 Gy irradiation but almost completely abrogated after modification with the hapten dinitrophenyl. After 7 or 14 days in tissue culture, melanoma cells continued to produce IL-10 but only at about 10% of the levels of freshly dissociated tissues. Moreover, of eight melanoma cell lines established from these cultures, only one produced IL-10 protein. To determine whether IL-10 was produced by melanoma cells or tumor-associated leukocytes, single-cell suspensions were fractionated with anti-CD45 antibody-conjugated magnetic beads. In four of five samples, IL-10 production was increased by depletion of leukocytes, suggesting that the primary source was the melanoma cells themselves. This was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of cytospin preparations and frozen tissue sections. Finally, 10 of 55 patients with clinically evident metastases showed elevations of circulating IL-10; three patients who had been melanoma-free developed high serum IL-10 levels, concurrent with the appearance of distant metastases. These data indicate that production of IL-10 is characteristic of metastatic melanomas and raise the possibility that this cytokine allows tumors to avoid or to modulate immunological attack.",

Expression of cyt-MAA and HMW-MAA was evaluated by flow cytometry in NB cell lines, patients' neuroblasts ((FI)-NB), and short-term cultures of these latter cells (cNB). LGALS3BP gene expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR on (FI)-NB, cNB, and primary tumor specimens. Soluble HMW-MAA and cyt-MAA were tested by ELISA. Cyt-MAA and HMW-MAA were expressed in NB cell lines, cNB, and (FI)-NB samples. LGALS3BP gene expression was higher in primary tumors and cNB than in (FI)-NB samples. Soluble cyt-MAA, but not HMW-MAA, was detected in NB cell lines and cNBs supernatants. NB patients' serum levels of both antigens were higher than those of the healthy children. High cyt-MAA serum levels at diagnosis associated with higher incidence of relapse, independently from other known risk factors. In conclusion, both HMW-MAA and cyt-MAA antigens, and LGALS3BP gene, were expressed by NB cell lines and patients' neuroblasts, and both antigens' serum levels were increased in NB patients. Elevated serum levels of cyt-MAA at diagnosis correlated with relapse, supporting that cyt-MAA may serve as early serological biomarker to individuate patients at higher risk of relapse that may require a more careful follow-up, after being validated in a larger cohort of patients at different time-points during follow-up.

The goal of our study was to analyze the significance of the serum 5-S-CD level for the biochemical detection of metastases in human malignant melanoma (MM) and for monitoring the progression or the immunochemotherapeutically induced regression of MM. From 11 patients with metastatic MM observed between 1991 and 1995, serum samples were collected before and after each cycle of immunotherapy or immunochemotherapy. Samples were analyzed for 5-S-CD by automated high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Cycles of immunochemotherapy consisted of human interleukin 2 and IFN-alpha (four patients) or of human interleukin 2, IFN-alpha, and dacarbazine (seven patients). Serum value of 5-S-CD in our normal controls was 1.9 +/- 0.6 ng/ml. All patients with metastatic MM showed 5-S-CD serum levels above the upper normal limit of 3.2 ng/ml (10 nM) and ranged from 2.3-fold (4.3 +/- 3.9 ng/ml) of the normal control values in early stages of metastases to more than 50-fold (94.3 +/- 220.3 ng/ml) of the normal control values in advanced stages of the disease. In 28 of 41 (68%) immunochemotherapeutical cycles, a decrease of 5-S-CD was seen during therapy, and in 13 cycles (31.7%), an increase was seen. Patients with more than 68% decreasing cycles (defined as responders; n = 5) showed significantly longer survival times (P = 0.008) than patients with less than 68% decreasing cycles (nonresponders; n = 6). High levels of 5-S-CD were also observed in metastasizing amelanotic melanoma.

YKL-40 was an independent prognostic biomarker of OS in melanoma patients stage IIB-III.

The proteoglycan antigen, purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody that specifically detects this antigen, was used to immunize rabbits.

Furthermore, the reactivity patterns of the rabbit serum and of the monoclonal antibodies with a variety of tumor and normal cells were the same. Based on the these data, we conclude that the entire proteoglycan molecule is a melanoma-associated antigen. The monoclonal antibodies and immunoglobulin from the rabbit serum were tested in a double determinant immunoassay for the detection of antigen in a total of 339 sera from patients with various diseases. Elevated levels of circulating proteoglycan antigen were found in 76% of patients with a high metastatic melanoma tumor burden compared to 2% of healthy donors.

In order to compare normal values, we measured urinary excretion and serum concentration of 5-S-CD and 6H5M12C in 33 Japanese normal subjects. The mean values of 5-S-CD and 6H5M12C in urine were 0.45 and 0.39 mumol/day, respectively, and those in serum 4.3 and 3.6 nmol/l. Levels of these markers in urine were much more variable than those in serum. We have adopted 1.5 mumol/day and 10 nmol/l as the upper limits for normal ranges of the urinary excretion and serum concentration, for both markers. No significant differences were found between men and women. There were no correlations among the four markers. The urinary excretion of both markers showed significant decrease in elderly subjects as compared with middle-aged subjects, while the serum concentration showed no age-dependent differences.

Thus, the search for reliable methods to identify patients with high risk of disease progression as early as possible is of major importance. In our study, we analyzed the predictive value of soluble HLA-DR (sHLA-DR) in comparison to S100-beta in serum from 183 melanoma patients of different stages of disease and with or without current therapy using immunosorbent assays. sHLA-DR serum levels of 121 healthy individuals served as controls. We found significantly (p < 0.0005) reduced sHLA-DR serum levels in melanoma patients (0.70 +/- 0.08 SEM microg/ml) compared to controls (1.49 +/- 0.10 SEM microg/ml). Reduced sHLA-DR and increased S100-beta levels were associated with advanced disease stages and tumor load. S100-beta was increased under cytostatic therapy (p < 0.0005), whereas sHLA-DR was not influenced by therapy modalities. Univariate analysis showed an association of sHLA-DR < 0.3 microg/ml and S100-beta > 0.12 microg/l with poor overall (p = 0.021 and p = 0.0009) and progression-free survival (p < 0.0005 and p = 0.0025). Multivariate analysis revealed disease stage (p = 0.0093) and tumor burden (p < 0.0005) as independent predictive factors for overall survival, and sHLA-DR (p = 0.0007) and tumor burden (p = 0.0015) for progression-free survival. In contrast to S100-beta, sHLA-DR serum concentrations < 0.3 microg/ml were strongly associated (p = 0.0001) with poor progression-free survival in a subgroup of 60 nonmetastasized patients. In conclusion, our results suggest sHLA-DR as a potent prognostic serum marker in melanoma patients superior to S100-beta in helping to identify early-stage patients at high risk of disease progression.",

We have already shown that the serum L-dopa/L-tyrosine ratio (an index of tyrosinase functional activity) correlates with the tumour burden and in some cases predicted disease progression in metastatic melanoma patients. We examined the potential value of this ratio for the follow-up, therapy monitoring and prognosis in melanoma compared with a reference marker (S100B, a melanoma-associated antigen). Sixty melanoma patients (24 stage I-II, 18 stage III, 18 stage IV, American Joint Committee on Cancer staging) were entered into the study, sampled two to eight times (before and after therapy) and were followed for up to 30 months. Serum L-dopa and L-tyrosine were determined by high performance liquid chromatography and S100B by an immunoluminometric assay. In stage III patients with elevated marker concentration, lymph node dissection decreased the S100B level (from 0.27 to < 0.13 microg/l, P=0.008), but not the L-dopa/L-tyrosine ratio. Chemotherapy decreased the L-dopa/L-tyrosine ratio by 38% (P =0.04) and the S100B level by 45% (P = 0.02) in stage IV responders. During follow-up, patients with marker levels within normal limits (n=19) had stable disease, except for two stage II patients. In patients with progressive disease (n=20), an increase in one or both markers was observed. Stage IV patients with high L-Dopa/L-Tyrosine ratio (above 20 x 10-5) at inclusion had shorter survival (3 months), while patients with low levels had longer survival (15 months). Levels of S100B had no impact on survival, as all stage IV patients (with levels below or above 0.38 microg/l) had the same survival (5 months). The serum L-dopa/L-tyrosine ratio may be influenced by successful therapy and levels at inclusion may correlate with prognosis in stage IV patients. Levels of these two markers in other biological fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid and tumour exudates may be useful diagnostically and prognostically in difficult cases.",

The patients developed high levels of cytotoxic (CTX) and complement-fixing (CF) antibodies to the UCLA-SO-M14 (M14) cells, one of the three melanoma cell lines in the MCV. Significant rises in CTX and CF antibodies occurred one month post-immunotherapy. While the level of CTX antibodies was maintained for 11 months thereafter, the titer of CF antibodies was sustained for seven months, then gradually declined. When the sera were absorbed with lymphoblastoid (ML14) cells which are autologous to the M14 cells, two residual peaks of CTX antibodies, one and four months postimmunotherapy and two peaks of CF antibodies, one and seven months postimmunotherapy, emerged. Two sera that exhibited high levels of CTX and CF antibodies one month postimmunotherapy were absorbed with ML14 cells and human fetal brain tissue. The reactivity of one serum in both the CDAC and MCF assays were abolished, whereas the reactivity of the other serum was not significantly diminished in either assay. These data indicate that the stage II post-surgical melanoma patients developed a humoral immune response to at least two distinct tumor antigens on the membrane of the M14 cells. One of these antigens appeared to be of fetal origin (OFA), the other M14-associated (TAA).

In order to appreciate a patient's individual prognosis, an attempt is made to find new tumor markers that parallel the disease progression. Objective. To identify if melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) protein could represent a tool for selecting high risk early stages melanoma patients. Method. Between 2008 and 2013, 155 patients with CMM were treated in our clinic. 84 of them were classified into stages I and II, according to TNM 2009. MIA serum concentration was measured in all patients and 50 healthy donors. A cut-off value of 9.4 ng/ml was established using the ROC curve. Results. All patients were followed up by periodic investigations every 6 months. We have noticed that 66% of patients with MIA serum values at diagnosis greater than 9.4 ng/mL have relapsed, while only 5% of patients with MIA serum concentration below the estimated threshold, recurred during the follow-up period (P = 0.000). The death risk was 12 times higher in pathological MIA group of patients (P = 0.0001). Conclusions. Our data suggest that MIA is an independent prognostic factor for patients with localized CMM. ",

Melanoma associated antigen expression and secretion was identical to that of M14 cells grown in parallel in serum supplemented medium. Spent synthetic media was found to be an enriched serum free source for the initial isolation of 100 kilodalton secreted glycoprotein MAA. M14 melanoma cells grown in synthetic media were also shown to be adaptable to the double agar clonogenic assay facilitating the examination of clonal heterogeneity in functional studies of MAA in melanoma tumor biology. Recent investigations from this laboratory have focused on characterizing human melanoma associated antigens (MAA) found either as secreted or cell surface associated glycoproteins in human melanoma cell lines. In these studies, monoclonal and polyclonal antiserums to melanoma cell components have been developed to specifically identify these MAAs immunochemically and provide a means to study the structural biochemistry of these determinants. At this time we have identified two antigens on which our research efforts are targeted: 1) a 100,000 dalton secreted glycoprotein (100K) common to melanoma, sarcoma and neuroblastoma tumor cell lines, and 2) a 250,000 dalton-high molecular weight component glycoprotein-proteoglycan complex which is thus far restricted to melanoma cells. The ultimate goal of our efforts is two-fold. Initially, we hope to develop schemes to isolate these melanoma associated antigens in sufficient quantities to obtain detailed structural information on these molecules, and secondly, we wish to implicate these glycoproteins in functional aspects of the biology of metastatic human melanoma in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

After transfecting melanoma cells with PAK1-shRNA for silencing PAK1 gene, melanin content, tyrosinase activity, and kinase activity of PAK1 were compared between the wild-type and transfectants. We found that (i) PAK1 is significantly activated by melanogenic hormones such as IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methyl xanthine) and α-MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone), (ii) silencing the endogenous PAK1 gene in melanoma cells through PAK1-specific shRNA reduces both melanin content and tyrosinase activity in the presence of both serum and melanogenic hormones to the basal level, (iii) the exogenously added wild-type PAK1 in the melanoma cells boosts the α-MSH-inducible melanin level by several folds without affecting the basal, and (iv) α-MSH/IBMX-induced melanogenesis hardly takes place in the absence of either serum or PAK1, clearly indicating that PAK1 is essential mainly for serum- and α-MSH/IBMX-dependent melanogenesis, but not the basal, in melanoma cells.

The frequency and phenotype of lymphocyte subpopulations were determined by flow cytometry while T cell cytokine secretion was measured by multiplex assays.;Progression-free survival (PFS) as well as overall survival (OS) were similar in patients treated with either BRAFi. High pretreatment LDH was associated with shorter PFS and OS in both groups. During therapy, peripheral lymphocytes decreased by 24.3% (median, P < 0.0001) in vemurafenib-treated patients but remained unchanged in dabrafenib-treated patients (+1.2%, P = 0.717). Differentiation of peripheral lymphocytes of vemurafenib-treated patients showed a significant decrease in CD4(+) T cells (P < 0.05). Within CD4(+) T cells obtained during treatment, an increase in CCR7(+)CD45RA(+) (naïve) and a decrease in CCR7(+)CD45RA(-) (central memory) populations were found (P < 0.01 for both). Furthermore, secretion of interferon-γ and interleukin-9 by CD4(+) T cells was significantly lower in samples obtained during vemurafenib treatment compared with baseline samples.;While both compounds have comparable clinical efficacy, vemurafenib but not dabrafenib decreases patients peripheral lymphocyte counts and alters CD4(+) T cell phenotype and function.

The cell-surface antigens recognized by these antisera were examined using cell-surface labelling with (125)I, followed by immunoprecipitation of soluble extracts of the cells and polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitates in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). Up to 16 cell-surface antigens were recognized by these antisera, and 5 of the melanoma cell lines had a similar profile of cell-surface antigens. Digestion of labelled melanoma cells with neuraminidase before immunoprecipitation revealed that 8 of the larger antigens were sialoglycoproteins. The melanoma antisera produced haemagglutination of human erythrocytes at high dilutions, but the antigens involved could not be detected by iodination. In contrast, absorption of the melanoma sera with lymphocytes and fibroblasts revealed that these cells did contain some cell-surface glycoproteins in common with melanoma cells. The melanoma antisera contained antibodies to foetal calf serum proteins, but the amounts of these proteins on the surface of melanoma-cells were very low. Immunoprecipitation of labelled melanoma cell extracts with monospecific antiserum to β(2)-microglobulin produced 2 bands with mol. wts corresponding to β(2)-microglobulin and the HLA-determinant polypeptide chain. After absorption of melanoma antisera with cross-linked foetal calf serum, erythrocytes, lymphocytes and fibroblasts, antibodies against 10 labelled antigens remained in the absorbed antisera.

The presence of metastases was manifested by a significant increase in the serum levels of both isolated TAA.

In the first, mice were implanted with melanoma and divided into four groups, according to treatment: interferon preparation; interferon control preparation (\"breakthrough fraction\"); phosphate-buffered saline control; and murine serum albumin control. Daily, each mouse was given i.p. injections of 200,000 NIH reference units (hereafter called units) of interferon or of one of the control substances. The second experiment was similar to the first, except that bovine serum albumin was an additional control. In both experiments, the average tumor volume in interferon-treated mice was statistically significantly smaller than that of each control group. Mouse interferon preparations also inhibited the multiplication of B16 malignant melanoma cells in culture. This inhibition was statistically significant from interferon levels as low as 5 to as high as 5000 units/ml. The degree of inhibition markedly increased from 5 up to 500 units, the inhibition reaching its maximum at this concentration. The inhibitory effect of interferon was abrogated by anti-murine interferon serum produced in a rabbit. These findings suggest that the in vivo inhibition of the growth of B16 melanoma demonstrated with polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid and with exogenous interferon probably results, at least in part, from a direct effect of interferon on the tumor cells themselves.",

Overall, the goals of cancer staging are to characterize the status of cancer at a specific moment in time, risk stratify, facilitate prognostication, and inform clinical decision making. The revisions to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) melanoma staging system over time reflect changes in our understanding of the biology of the disease. Since the 1st edition, where tumor thickness was defined anatomically by its relationship to the reticular or papillary dermis (Clark level) as well as tumor thickness (Breslow thickness), there have been significant strides in our use of clinicopathological variables to stratify low- versus high-risk patients. Management of the regional nodal basin has also changed dramatically over time, impacted by techniques such as lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and changes in pathological evaluation of the regional lymph nodes. Additionally, stratification of distant metastases has evolved as survival outcomes have been shown to vary based upon anatomic site of metastases and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. The variables in use in the current (7th edition) AJCC staging system are surrogate markers of biology with validated impact of survival outcomes. Going forward, it is likely that these and additional clinicopathological factors will be integrated with molecular and other correlates of melanoma tumor biology to further refine and personalize melanoma staging.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation of c-kit and the impact of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 was examined in the three uveal melanoma cell lines OCM-1, OCM-3, and 92-1.;Eighty-four of 134 paraffin-embedded samples and six of eight fresh-frozen samples expressed c-kit. c-Kit was strongly expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured uveal melanoma cells compared with cutaneous melanoma cells. Moreover, in contrast to cutaneous melanoma cell lines c-kit maintained a high phosphorylation level in serum-depleted uveal melanoma cells. No activation-related mutations in exon 11 of the KIT gene were found. On the contrary, expression of the stem cell growth factor (c-kit ligand) was detected in all three uveal melanoma cell lines, suggesting the presence of autocrine (paracrine) stimulation pathways. Treatment of uveal melanoma cell lines with STI571, which blocks c-kit autophosphorylation, resulted in cell death. The IC(50) of the inhibitory effects on c-kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation was of equal size and less than 2.5 microM.;The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.",

Dual-lectin affinity chromatography was used to extract glycoproteins from a melanoma cell line. Liquid-based reverse phase separation and microarray platforms were then applied to separate and spot these natural proteins on nitrocellulose slides. The serum autoantibodies were investigated by exposing these proteins to sera from 43 patients that have already been diagnosed to have different stages of early melanoma. The combination of 9 fractions provides a 55% sensitivity with 100% specificity for the detection of node positive against node negative and a 62% sensitivity with 100% specificity for the detection of node negative against node positive. Recombinant proteins were used to confirm the results using a sample set with 79 patients with diagnosed melanoma. The response of sera against recombinant 94 kD glucose-regulated protein (GRP94), acid ceramidase (ASAH1), cathepsin D (CTSD), and lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) shared a similar pattern to the fractions where they were identified.

In our patients, median sEGF-R level was significantly elevated (P < 0.0001) compared with that of healthy controls (173.4 vs. 91.9 fm/ml). Age or sex was not associated with sEGF-R levels. Regarding tumor burden, in contrary to the detected IL-6 levels, we found that median sEGF-R levels were significantly (P = 0.045) lower in patients with high tumor burden (163 fm/ml) than in those with low tumor burden (193.8 fm/ml). An inverse correlation between IL-6 levels and sEGF-R was observed (r =-0.33; P = 0.040). No relationship between sEGF-R and time to progression or overall survival was observed while circulating IL-6 was found as a predictive factor of survival. Our results showed that sEGF-R level was elevated in metastatic malignant melanoma patients but not related to time to progression or survival and demonstrated an inverse correlation between sEGF-R and IL-6 levels.

The serum-mediated suppression was not restricted by major histocompatibility complex and was time-dependent. Addition of 10% human serum from the patients with metastatic melanoma [HS-Pt(m)] to the culture of PBMC with rIL-2 at the same time or 1 day after incubation significantly inhibited LAK activity. However, addition of 10% HS-Pt(m) 2 or 3 days after incubation did not inhibit LAK activity. Incubation of PBMC for 2 h with a high dose (10(4) U/ml) of rIL-2 in the presence of 10% HS-Pt(m), followed by incubation in the absence of either rIL-2 or HS-Pt(m), did not affect LAK cell activity. These results suggest that HS-Pt(m) inhibits the early stage of LAK cell differentiation, rather than the binding of rIL-2 to PBMC or a later stage in the differentiation. In contrast to PBMC, monocyte-depleted peripheral blood lymphocytes exhibited comparable levels of LAK activity when cultured with rIL-2 either in 10% fetal calf serum, 10% human serum from healthy donors or 10% HS-Pt(m). Addition of purified autologous monocytes to the culture of monocyte-depleted peripheral blood lymphocytes with rIL-2 suppressed LAK cell induction when 10% HS-Pt(m) was present. Thus serum-mediated suppression of LAK cell induction is largely dependent on the presence of monocytes, which may produce a secondary inhibitor that acts on lymphocytes. Addition of indomethacin to the culture did not reverse this monocyte-dependent serum-mediated suppression in a majority of cases, suggesting that prostaglandin E2 does not have a major role in the suppression.",

This study links the soluble forms of RAGE (sRAGE and esRAGE) with clinical outcome of melanoma patients. Moreover, tissue expression of RAGE was analyzed using immunohistochemistry on two independent tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 35 or 257 primary melanomas, and 41 or 22 benign nevi, respectively. Serum concentrations of sRAGE and esRAGE were measured in 229 Stage III-IV patients using ELISA and plasma concentrations of sRAGE were analyzed in an independent second cohort with 173 samples of Stage I-IV patients. In this cohort, three well-described SNPs in the RAGE gene were analyzed. RAGE protein expression was highly upregulated in primary melanomas compared to benign nevi in the two TMA (p < 0.001 and p = 0.005) as well as in sun-exposed melanomas (p = 0.046). sRAGE and esRAGE were identified as prognostic markers for survival as diminished sRAGE (p = 0.034) and esRAGE (p = 0.012) serum levels correlated with poor overall survival (OS). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that diminished serum sRAGE was independently associated with poor survival (p = 0.009). Moreover, diminished sRAGE was strongly associated with impaired OS in the second cohort (p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis including the investigated SNPs revealed an independent correlation of the two interacting promoter SNPs with impaired OS. In conclusion, the soluble forms of RAGE and variants in its genetic locus are prognostic markers for survival in melanoma patients with high risk for progression.",

Tumor cells as they become more metastatic, gradually lose their dependence on both adhesion and serum. Thus, in the process of tumor progression cells undergo series of changes that allow them to adapt to different tissue milieu. This implies that during this process, points on the integrin pathway may become constitutively activated. In the present study we investigated the possible role of FAK, being one of the key members of the integrin-signaling pathway, in the multistep progression towards a malignant phenotype in human melanoma. In our study we show that in melanoma cells there is neither an increase in the amount of FAK nor in its phosphorylation capacity, but rather in its levels of constitutive activation. Indeed, in all melanoma cells tested and not in nevus and neuroblastoma cells, we observed various degrees of constitutive activation of FAK. Our results also suggest that FAK constitutive activation is regulated at least in part by the cytoskeleton, implying that steps along the integrin signaling pathway involving FAK could be among the oncogenic mechanisms that operate in melanoma and may account for the highly aggressive, anchorage independent phenotype of this tumor.",

Recent studies have suggested that PDGFR-beta inhibition reduces tumor IFP, and thus increases the uptake of concomitantly administered drugs.;The present study was designed to investigate the potential of imatinib mesylate as a therapy for melanoma or as an adjuvant to chemotherapeutics.;Using in vivo mouse models, the effect of imatinib mesylate on the growth of melanoma with or without dacarbazine was studied.;Imatinib mesylate enhanced the antitumor effect of dacarbazine on in vivo growth and lung metastases of melanoma cells, although treatment with only imatinib mesylate had no effect. We could detect perivascular expression of PDGF beta-receptor in melanoma tumors. Interestingly, dacarbazine uptake in melanoma was more than three-times increased by treatment with imatinib mesylate, while its uptake in serum or bone marrow was not affected by imatinib mesylate.;These data suggest interference with PDGF receptors, or their ligands, as a novel strategy to increase drug uptake and therapeutic effectiveness of chemotherapy for melanoma.",

To this end we have prepared and tested a new alpha-emitting radioimmunoconjugate (RIC) against malignant melanoma. The melanoma antibody 9.2.27 is specific for most melanoma cell lines. This antibody was labelled with an a emitter, bismuth-213 (213Bi), and a positron emitter, terbium-152 (152Tb), which is an analogue of the alpha-emitting radioisotope terbium-149. The chelators cDTPAa (a cyclic anhydride of diethylenetriamine pentacetic acid) and CHX-A\" (a 2-(p-SCN-Bz)-cyclohexyl-DTPA ligand) were used in order to obtain high labelling yields for both isotopes with either chelator. The labelling efficiency with 213Bi was found to be 96% and 92% with cDTPAa and CHX-A\", respectively. With 152Tb it was 93% and 89%, respectively. Serum stability studies showed 20% leaching with 213Bi over a period of 2.5 half-lives. For 152Tb the leaching was 13%. There was no difference in the melanoma cell binding of the labelled and unlabelled antibodies. DNA synthesis data were compared for both isotopes with either chelator. Based on these results, the therapeutic activity ratio for 213Bi a particles and 152Tb positrons for the same endpoint was calculated to be 120. The stability of the bismuth and terbium RICs, together with the outstanding cytotoxicity of the alpha emitter, provides the basis for a new approach to the potential control of micrometastatic melanoma.",

Participants underwent assessments of motor function (Unified PD Rating Scale; keyboard tapping test), olfactory function, colour vision, depressive symptoms, the Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire, and transcranial brain sonography. Raters were blinded to the diagnosis and clinical data of study participants.;Patients with melanoma showed increased frequency of substantia nigra hyperechogenicity and prodromal motor and non-motor features of PD, especially asymmetric motor slowing and apathy. Hyposmia and colour vision disturbance were, however, infrequent. Larger echogenicity of substantia nigra correlated with lower serum iron in patients with melanoma, similar to previously reported findings in PD, and independently from the earlier findings, with lighter skin pigmentation. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, combined with motor asymmetry or hyposmia, was present at baseline in all participants with mild or definite parkinsonism diagnosed after 1 year. Parkinsonism was specifically related to melanoma location at the sun-exposed skin of the head or neck.;History of melanoma was associated with increased prevalence of prodromal markers of PD.

Five months later, the onset of Raynaud's phenomenon together with highly positive Jo-1 antibodies was observed. The following clinical course of scleroderma was correlated to melanoma remission and progression. Finally, the patient developed severe pulmonary fibrosis, massive pleural effusion, severe thoracic scleroderma and necrosis of the fingertips, simultaneously with a progression of melanoma to disseminated lymph node metastases and a small brain metastasis.

In this study, the serum L-dopa/L-tyrosine ratio was compared with serum S100B as a reference marker. A total of 89 melanoma patients were sampled and staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification. Of these, 19 stage III and 28 stage IV patients were evaluated for disease progression at 1.5 years and 6 months post-sampling, respectively. Serum L-dopa and L-tyrosine were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (normal value for ratio < 16 x 10(-5)) and S100B using the LIA-mat Sangtec 100 assay (normal value < 0.10 microg/l). Non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance, Dunn's and Spearman) were used for the statistical analysis. The median serum L-dopa/L-tyrosine ratio was 16.0 x 10(-5) (range 2.7-545.1 x 10-5 and the median S100B level was 0.15 microg/l (range < 0.10-13.8 microg/l), with a sensitivity of 51% for the ratio and 66% for S100B. There was a 47% discordance and no correlation between the two markers (r = 0.149). The ratio was higher in stage IV than in other stages (P < 0.05), as was the S100B level (P < 0.0001). Both markers were higher in patients with evolutive disease (n = 23) than in stable patients (n = 24), with values of 20.8 x 10(-5) versus 13.1 x 10(-5) for the ratio (P < 0.05) and 0.89 microg/l versus 0.16 microg/l for S100B (P < 0.001); for the ratio, this difference was more pronounced in stage III than in stage IV patients. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the markers to predict disease progression were 78% and 67%, respectively, for the ratio, and 74% and 83%, respectively, for S100B (using an ROC cut-off of 0.38 microg/l). In conclusion, the serum L-dopa/L-tyrosine ratio correlates with melanoma progression and has predictive value, especially in stage III patients.

In this study, we performed a complex analysis of various inflammatory factors, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the peripheral blood of patients suffering from malignant melanoma of different stages. We demonstrated that levels of serum IL-1β, IFN-γ and CXCL10 were significantly increased in advanced melanoma patients. In addition, these factors were found to be associated with an increased frequency of MDSCs and Tregs as compared to age- and gender-matched healthy donors. Importantly, advanced melanoma patients with signs of progression displayed markedly elevated concentrations of IL-1β and CXCL10 as compared to patients with stable disease. Moreover, an enrichment of circulating monocytic (Mo)-MDSCs significantly correlated with a decreased progression free survival of these patients. Our data highlight a complex association between circulating inflammatory mediators, Mo-MDSCs and the clinical outcome as well as suggest that their levels in patients with advanced melanoma are of important prognostic value allowing the identification of those with high risk of disease progression.

Interferon (IFN) is commonly used in patients with melanoma who remain at high risk for relapse following surgery; however, the optimal scheduling and dose are not agreed upon. Pegylation of IFN involves conjugation with polyethylene glycol. Following subcutaneous injection of pegIFN, the rate of absorption, renal and cellular clearance, and immunogenicity are reduced. As a result of the extended serum half-life, once-weekly administration is feasible, compared with the daily and/or thrice weekly dosing of IFN. When compared with observation alone in patients with resected stage III melanoma, pegIFN demonstrated a significant increase in relapse-free survival, with a marginal impact on overall survival. The most common adverse events were as expected with IFN and included fatigue, increased liver enzymes, pyrexia, headache, anorexia, myalgia, nausea, chills, depression, and injection site reactions. A large Phase 3 study is underway to further assess outcome and toxicity differences between pegIFN weekly and low-dose IFN thrice weekly.;PegIFN is a modified version of the previously approved interferon indicated for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma.

S100-beta is widely established as a reliable prognostic indicator in patients with advanced metastatic disease but is of limited predictive value in tumor-free patients.

Serum samples from 55 additional patients after complete dissection of regional lymph node metastases (AJCC stage III), with 28 of 55 patients relapsing within the first year of follow-up, were analyzed in an attempt to predict disease recurrence. Serum S100-beta was measured using a sandwich immunoluminometric assay.;Analysis of 205 stage I/IV serum samples, utilizing a training set of 94 of 205 and a test set of 15 of 205 samples for 32 different ANN models, revealed correct stage assignment in 84 (88%) of 96 of a blind set of 96 of 205 serum samples. Forty-four (80%) of 55 stage III serum samples could be correctly assigned as progressors or nonprogressors using random sample cross-validation statistical methodologies. Twenty-three (82%) of 28 stage III progressors were correctly identified by MALDI-ToF combined with ANN, whereas only six (21%) of 28 could be detected by S100-beta.;Validation of these findings may enable proteomic profiling to become a valuable tool for identifying high-risk melanoma patients eligible for adjuvant therapeutic interventions.",

Here we compare the expression of MARCKS in human tumor-derived choroidal melanoma cells (OCM-1) and in primary cultures of normal choroidal melanocytes. We found an important down-regulation of the protein in the melanoma cell line. Stable transfection of these cells with the cDNA coding for MARCKS led to the selection of several clones expressing variable levels of the protein. Proliferation experiments performed with four of these clones revealed that cell growth was reduced by 35-40% when compared with control cells. Upon serum starvation, cell proliferation was almost abolished when the expression level of MARCKS was high, whereas it was only partially reduced in the controls. MARCKS overexpression induced a higher percentage of cells in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle upon serum starvation, as well as the inhibition of colony formation in soft agar. Finally, the expression of the CDK inhibitor p27 was increased in the cells presenting a high level of MARCKS protein. Altogether, these data suggest that the expression of this protein kinase C substrate affects the proliferation and partially reverts the transformed phenotype of the OCM-1 cells.",

The melanoma nature of the cells growing in MoAb 225.28S coated dishes is indicated by the specific reactivity with anti-HMW-MAA MoAb, by its detection in spent culture medium and by morphological criteria. The specificity of the procedure is proven by the lack of growth of cells seeded in fetal calf serum (FCS) coated dishes, as well as of cells lacking the HMW-MAA in MoAb 225.28S coated dishes.

The antigen, detected by autologous serum S150, was found to be broadly represented on melanoma, glioma, renal cell carcinoma, neuroblastoma and head and neck carcinoma cell lines. S150 did not react with bladder or colon carcinoma, fetal fibroblasts, pooled platelets, lymphocytes and red blood cells, autologous cultured lymphocytes or fetal calf serum. To further characterize the antigen, spent tissue culture media, obtained from autologous melanoma cell line, Y-Mel 84:420, was separated by an isoelectric focusing column. Unabsorbed control serum S150 was noted to have a maximum titer of 1:2040 against autologous melanoma cells as measured by protein A hemadsorption. Following isoelectric focusing the greatest decrease in autologous antibody titer (30-fold) occurred with fractions having a pI between 2 and 3. Further resolution of the antigen was accomplished with high-pressure ion-exchange chromatography. One of these fractions showed a significantly higher concentration of antigen and was distinctly resolved from bulk serum albumin. Subsequent Western blot analysis, with autologous antibody, of the isolated antigen-containing fraction, confirmed the presence of a single 66 kDa band. Exposure of the antigen, purified by high-pressure ion-exchange chromatography, to neuraminidase ablated recognition by autologous antibody and suggests that sialic acid is present on the protein and may be part of the antigenic epitope. Binding of antigen, obtained following DEAE anion exchange chromatography, was noted to lectins derived from Triticum vulgaris, Dolichos biflorus and Lycopersicon esculentum. Preparative purification of the antigen was accomplished by anion exchange followed by lectin affinity chromatography with a Dolichos biflorus column. Antigen obtained following lectin affinity chromatography subjected to SDS-PAGE and silver stain revealed a single band at 66 kDa. We conclude that a melanoma-associated antigen detected by autologous antibody in spent tissue culture media is an unusually acidic glycoprotein (pI 2-3).",

However, little is known about the origin of IL-6 and the pattern of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) expression. In this report, we studied the expression of IL-6R and intracellular IL-6 using flow cytometry in tumour cells provided by fine-needle aspiration of lymph nodes and palpable metastatic lesions from 14 patients refractory to biochemotherapy and six responder patients. Moreover, we established the relationship between these parameters and the serum IL-6 level. Our results demonstrated that, following treatment, the percentage of HMB45-positive (HMB45+) cells expressing functional IL-6R, intracellular IL-6 or both IL-6R and IL-6 significantly decreased in patients refractory to biochemotherapy. In contrast, in responder patients the percentage of HMB45+ cells expressing IL-6R increased and those expressing IL-6 remained stable. Regarding the serum IL-6 level, an 11-fold increase was observed in the patients refractory to biochemotherapy, but only a 1.8-fold increase in the responder patients. In conclusion, in metastatic malignant melanoma patients with a poor prognosis, the endogenous production of IL-6 is concomitant with a decrease in functional IL-6R and intracellular IL-6 expression, suggesting the involvement of an IL-6/IL-6R complex.",

We studied circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in ipilimumab-treated patients to detect alterations in the myeloid cell compartment and possible correlations with clinical outcome. Lin(-) CD14(+) HLA-DR(-) monocytic MDSC were enriched in peripheral blood of melanoma patients compared to healthy donors (HD). Tumor resection did not significantly alter MDSC frequencies. During ipilimumab treatment, MDSC frequencies did not change significantly compared to baseline levels. We observed high inter-patient differences. MDSC frequencies in ipilimumab-treated patients were independent of baseline serum lactate dehydrogenase levels but tended to increase in patients with severe metastatic disease (M1c) compared to patients with metastases in skin or lymph nodes only (M1a), who had frequencies comparable to HD. Interestingly, clinical responders to ipilimumab therapy showed significantly less lin(-) CD14(+) HLA-DR(-) cells as compared to non-responders. The data suggest that the frequency of monocytic MDSC may be used as predictive marker of response, as low frequencies identify patients more likely benefitting from ipilimumab treatment.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy on metastatic melanoma patients with HLA-A2 or A24 genotype. METHODS: Nine cases of metastatic melanoma were enrolled into a phase I study of monocyte-derived dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy. HLA-genotype analysis revealed 4 cases of HLA-A*0201, 1 of A*0206 and 4 of A*2402. Enriched monocytes were obtained using OptiPreptrade mark from leukapheresis products, and then incubated with GM-CSF and IL-4 in a closed serum-free system. After pulsing with a cocktail of 5 melanoma-associated synthetic peptides (gp100, tyrosinase, MAGE-2, MAGE-3 and MART-1 or MAGE-1) restricted to HLA-A2 or A24 and KLH, cells were cryopreserved until used. Finally, thawed DCs were washed and injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the inguinal region in a dose-escalation manner. RESULTS: The mean percentage of DCs rated as lin-HLA-DR+ in melanoma patients was 46.4 +/- 15.6 %. Most of DCs expressed high level of co-stimulatory molecules and type1 phenotype (CD11c+HLA-DR+), while a moderate number of mature DCs with CD83 and CCR7 positive were contained in DC products. DC injections were well tolerated except for transient liver dysfunction (elevation of transaminases, Grade I-II). All 6 evaluable cases except for early PD showed positive immunological responses to more than 2 melanoma peptides in an ELISPOT assay. Two representative responders demonstrated strong HLA-class I protein expression in the tumor and very high scores of ELISPOT that might correlate to the regression of metastatic tumors. Clinical response through DC injections was as follows : 1CR, 1 PR, 1SD and 6 PD. All 59 DC injections in the phase I study were tolerable in terms of safety, however, the maximal tolerable dose of DCs was not determined. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that peptide cocktail-treated DC-based immunotherapy had the potential for utilizing as one of therapeutic tools against metastatic melanoma in Japan.",

An additional study of antigenic modulation was performed in 23 nonanergic and seven anergic melanoma patients, tested simultaneously with melanoma TAA prepared from primary and metastatic tumors, which had been obtained from one patient at different time periods. The results of pilot clinical trials are reported, including toxicity, timing and dosage studies in 20 patients and subsequent studies of patients with metastatic melanoma treated at three separate centers, using a single lot of purified, allogeneic melanoma TAA. The results of these latter studies in 51 patients with Stage III (distantly metastatic) melanoma and in five patients with earlier stages of disease indicate that: (1) when the interval from primary therapy to recurrence is greater than one year and when liver, bone and brain are not involved, partial or total clinical regression may be noted in up to 25% of patients with metastatic disease receiving immunochemotherapy; (2) when total regression does occur, the effect usually lasts from one to three years; (3) cytoreductive (debulking) surgery, when possible, in cutaneous, nodal retroperitoneal, and visceral regions may enhance the response to specific active immunochemotherapy, although some debulked patients had less tumor burden and this factor alone may lead to an improved prognosis in patients undergoing any subsequent treatment; (4) when circulating inhibitory factors are modified through preimmunization chemotherapy, an enhanced host response may be seen; and (5) Cancer Serum Indices (CSI) may be useful in predicting recurrence and in following tumor load and response to therapy. Information obtained from these studies suggest the need for further trials to determine the effect of immunization on patients with earlier stages of disease where recurrence rates remain high, and to evaluate the mechanisms of tumor rejection or tumor progression in the face of immune stimulation.",

This report describes the purification of that mitogen, termed MGSA for melanoma growth stimulatory activity, from serum-free conditioned medium from the Hs0294 cultures. MGSA has been purified from acetic acid extracts of lyophilized conditioned medium by gel filtration, reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and preparative electrophoresis, resulting in a greater than 400,000-fold purification. MGSA bioactivity resides in acid- and heat-stable polypeptides of high and low molecular weight (24-28 kd and less than 14-16 kd). However, the majority of the activity is reproducibly associated with the approximately 16-kd moiety eluting from RP-HPLC at approximately 35% acetonitrile. Reduction with dithiothreitol or B-mercaptoethanol results in a loss of biological activity but does not convert the 24-28-kd moieties to the less than 14-16-kd forms of MGSA. 125I-MGSA that has been purified by preparative electrophoresis (16 kd) specifically binds to Hs0294 melanoma cells and retains 100% of the growth-stimulatory activity. The 16-kd MGSA stimulates the proliferation of Hs0294 cells at concentrations of 0.3-30 pM. The electrophoretic mobility of MGSA is also unaltered by the preparative electrophoresis procedure, further demonstrating that this procedure does not alter the biochemical integrity of the growth factor. Purified MGSA does not enable anchorage-independent growth of normal rat kidney (NRK) cells and is therefore different from the previously described transforming growth factors. The amino acid composition of MGSA differs from that of other previously described growth factors. These data demonstrate that MGSA represents a separate class of growth factors with biological and biochemical properties different from other growth factors.",

Moreover, the synergistic anti-tumor effect of TNF and anti-angiogenic agent TNP-470 suggested a cooperative activity of both substances on tumor vasculature. Microscopically, the effect of TNF injections was expressed by an increase in the amount of tumor cells with nuclear pyknosis and karryorrhexis. In vitro assays indicated a direct cytotoxic effect of TNF against Ab melanoma cells, most probably as an outcome of apoptosis.

Markers related to carcinogenesis and angiogenesis in particular have effect on the course of the disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical utility of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), and YKL-40 in serum of melanoma patients at pathological stages I-III. We included 148 adult patients with melanoma. The median follow-up was 40 months. Disease recurrence was observed in 43 patients; 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 71.7%; 35 patients died; and the 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was 85%. Concentrations of VEGF, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and YKL-40 were measured by ELISA kits. VEGF, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and YKL-40 were significantly higher in group of patients than in controls. Increased concentrations of TIMP-1 were related to patient survival, which in the group of lower and increased TIMP-1, disease-free survival amounted to 81 vs. 61% (p = 0.014) and overall survival -88 vs. 82% (p = 0.050), respectively. An increased concentration of YKL-40 was observed in 59% of patients with ulceration and in 26% of patients without ulceration (p = 0.012). We have found a clinically significant correlation between YKL-40 and MMP-9 (rho = 0.363; p = 0.004) as well as YKL-40 and VEGF (rho = 0.306; p = 0.018). In melanoma patients at stages I-III, the high concentrations of TIMP-1 in serum predicted adverse prognosis.

When antibodies directed against human fibroblast IFN were incorporated into the media of high-density cells stimulated to proliferate with serum, the cells entered the cell cycle earlier than did the controls. In investigating the biochemical basis for this finding, we have found that there is an inverse relationship between the (2'-5')oligoadenylate synthetase levels and the percentage of cells in S in untreated cultures. Upon IFN treatment, the relationship is obliterated and (2'-5')oligoadenylate synthetase levels increase throughout all phases of the cell cycle. This increase in enzyme levels correlates well with the decreased probability of the IFN-treated cells to cycle.

A paraneoplastic autoimmune manifestation of this disease is melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR). MAR has been associated with prolonged survival and may be an early marker of tumor progression. By screening a retina and a melanoma cDNA phage library by SEREX using sera of patients suffering from melanoma and, in some cases, clinical symptoms of MAR, we identified 20 new antigens (HD-MM-28-47), of which 14 clones had high homology to well-known genes. Six of these genes had previously been associated with retina: rhodopsin, visual arrestin, MEK1, SRPX, BBS1 and galectin-3. Individual clones were recognized by up to 43% of patients' sera, while sera of healthy volunteers were negative except in 2 cases. The expression profile of the antigens identified on the basis of homologous EST database entries in healthy tissues was ubiquitous to differential. Using RT-PCR, we found frequent expression of preselected antigens in melanoma cell lines. For rhodopsin, this could be quantified by quantitative PCR. Retinal proteins were recognized by serum antibodies of melanoma patients but not healthy controls. The role of these antigens in MAR awaits further investigation.

The results were related to simultaneously performed microcytotoxicity (MC) tests, HL-A typing, plasma membrane fluorescence and B:T cell ratios in the peripheral blood. Furthermore, lymphocytes from six melanoma patients were tested in CMC and ADCC assays against autologous tumour cells. The following results were obtained. (1) A large number of healthy controls possessed lymphocytes which readily lysed M1 target cells in CMC and MC assays. (2) CMC activity of lymphocytes from melanoma patients was generally lower than that of control lymphocytes and decreased further with progression of the disease. (3) CLL lymphocytes were virtually non-toxic for M1 cells, even at high aggressor:target cell ratios. (4) ADCC assays with a heterologous rabbit-anti-M1 serum showed generally higher isotope release than CMC assays; this was particularly pronounced in the melanoma group and in the group of patients with other tumours. (5) No tumour-specific blocking factor could be detected in melanoma sera, as judged by the capacity of the sera to block CMC activity. (6) No obvious correlation was found between the results obtained in short-term CMC and long-term MC assays.

Thirty-one patients (22 men, nine women) with high-risk malignant melanoma received eight 6-week cycles of rIL-2 and rIFN-alpha. Serum samples of all patients were screened for the presence of antibodies against IFN-alpha by a solid enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Specimens testing positive in the EIA were assessed for their ability to neutralize the antiviral effects of IFN-alpha in vitro in an antibody-neutralizing bioassay (ANB). Furthermore, serum levels of neopterin, beta 2-microglobulin, soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), anticardiolipin and antithyroglobulin were evaluated. Of 31 patients, 11 (36%) developed binding antibodies; three (27%) of them had antibodies with neutralizing capacities (range, 350-28,000 INU/ml). Of male patients, 8 (36%) of 22 versus 1 (11%) of nine female patients developed antibodies. Statistical analysis (unpaired t test) revealed that all patients with antibody titers showed significant (p < 0.04) lower serum levels of beta 2-microglobulin and reproducible decreases in sIL-2R levels, whereby those with neutralizing antibodies showed significantly (p < 0.0001) lower values than did those with binding antibodies. Elevations of anticardiolipin (17 of 31) and antithyroglobulin (one of 31) were not correlated to the presence of IFN antibodies. Our results show the in vivo significance of antibodies against rIFN-alpha, especially of those with neutralizing capacities.

The oncofetal antigen GPC3 is a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored membrane protein and may be secreted. It is a novel tumor marker for human HCC: GPC3 protein was present in sera from 40-50% of HCC patients, but was not detected in sera from patients with liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis, or in sera from healthy individuals. alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) and PIVKA-II (protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II), are well known major tumor markers for HCC. Generally, AFP shows high positivity for HCC but also high false-positivity in detection assays. Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) is a recently described marker of HCC. Detection of AFP-L3 shows a much higher specificity than AFP, but a lower sensitivity. On the other hand, detection of PIVKA-II shows a lower false-positivity, but is not always sensitive enough to detect low levels secreted by small HCCs. There was no correlation between the three tumor markers, AFP, PIVKA-II, and GPC3 in terms of their presence in HCC cells. All three tumor markers showed similar positivity in patients with HCC, detecting 80% of patients with the disease. GPC3 is also a novel tumor marker for the diagnosis of human melanoma, especially in the early stages of the disease. Expression of GPC3 mRNA and protein was evident in tumor cells from >80% of patients with melanoma and melanocytic nevus, which is a common benign lesion. GPC3 protein was detected in sera from 40% (36/91) of melanoma patients, but not in sera from those with large congenital melanocytic nevus, or from healthy donors. Surprisingly, we detected serum GPC3 even in patients with stage 0, in situ melanoma. The positive detection rate of serum GPC3 at stage 0, I, and II (44.4%, 40.0%, 47.6%, respectively) was significantly higher than that of 5-S-cysteinyldopa, a well known tumor marker for melanoma (0.0%, 8.0%, and 10.0%, respectively). Interestingly, GPC3 was highly immunogenic in mice and elicited effective anti-tumor immunity with no evidence of autoimmunity. Thus, GPC3 is useful for diagnosis of HCC and melanoma and may also have a role in immunotherapy or tumor prevention. However, studies in humans are warranted.",

To evaluate whether serum IL-6 is a useful disease marker in metastatic malignant melanoma (MMM), we studied the time course of endogenous IL-6 secretion in 41 patients treated with cisplatinum, IL-2, and IFN-alpha. Furthermore, the relationship of endogenous IL-6 concentrations to the tumor burden and/or the clinical response was also evaluated. The baseline serum IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients with MMM than in the control group (P = 0.002). When tumor burden was taken into consideration, we found that IL-6 levels were higher in patients with high tumor burden than in patients with low tumor burden. During treatment in the whole patient population, a higher serum IL-6 level was observed in nonresponding as compared to responding patients at days 7 (P = 0.0005), 21 (P = 0.002), and 35 (P = 0.009). The follow-up of serum IL-6 in patients with MMM according to the tumor burden and clinical response demonstrated that: (a) IL-6 levels were significantly higher at days 7 and 21 in patients with high tumor burden as compared to those with low tumor burden; and (b) IL-6 levels remain significantly higher in nonresponding patients as compared to responding patients regardless of the tumor burden. From these results, we can conclude that endogenous IL-6 may play a role in the failure of IL-2 therapy in such patients, since the very early IL-6 increase is correlated with the tumor mass and nonresponse to biochemotherapy. Therefore, it seems that the early detection of endogenous IL-6 may represent valuable information for monitoring the response to biochemotherapy in patients with MMM.",

Although GRO alpha has been identified as a high affinity ligand for the IL-8 receptor beta (IL-8R beta) in recombinant systems, the receptor mediating its action in melanoma cells has been a matter of debate. Here, we show by reverse transcription and PCR expression of IL-8R beta, mRNA transcripts in different melanoma cell lines and in normal human melanocytes. To characterize the role of the IL-8R beta in melanoma cells, antiserum was raised in rabbits against a fusion protein containing the NH2-terminal portion of the receptor. Its specificity was shown by flow cytometry with IL-8R beta-transfected HL60 cells. A specific epitope could be mapped with IL-8R beta mutants to the peptide sequence between ASP-4 and ASP-14 of this receptor. Binding studies with [125I]GRO alpha in IL-8R beta transfectants indicated ligand antagonistic properties of this Ab. Expression of IL-8R beta protein at the cell surface of various melanoma cell lines could be shown by flow cytometry with F(ab')2 fragments of the IL-8R beta antiserum. Moreover, anti-IL-8R beta Ab partially blocked specific binding of [125I]GRO alpha in various melanoma cell lines. Addition of F(ab')2 fragments of the IL-8R beta antiserum or of neutralizing anti-GRO alpha mAb to different melanoma cell lines identified this GRO alpha-IL-8R beta interaction as a major component required for serum-independent melanoma cell growth.",

In this paper we used a large population-based cohort to replicate two published gene signatures for melanoma classification. We assessed the signatures prognostic value and explored their biological significance by correlating them with factors known to be associated with survival (vitamin D) or etiological routes (nevi, sun sensitivity and telomere length). Genomewide microarray gene expressions were profiled in 300 archived tumors (224 primaries, 76 secondaries). The two gene signatures classified up to 96% of our samples and showed strong correlation with melanoma specific survival (P=3 x 10(-4)), Breslow thickness (P=5 x 10(-10)), ulceration (P=9.x10-8) and mitotic rate (P=3 x 10(-7)), adding prognostic value over AJCC stage (adjusted hazard ratio 1.79, 95%CI 1.13-2.83), as previously reported. Furthermore, molecular subtypes were associated with season-adjusted serum vitamin D at diagnosis (P=0.04) and genetically predicted telomere length (P=0.03). Specifically, molecular high-grade tumors were more frequent in patients with lower vitamin D levels whereas high immune tumors came from patients with predicted shorter telomeres. Our data confirm the utility of molecular biomarkers in melanoma prognostic estimation using tiny archived specimens and shed light on biological mechanisms likely to impact on cancer initiation and progression.",

However, the intratumoral injection of AdRGD causes limited transgene expression in healthy normal tissue, due to unwanted vector spread. Herein, we describe our attempt to overcome this limitation related to the safety of HSVtk/GCV treatment by using AdRGD carrying either melanoma-specific tyrosinase (Tyr) promoter or tumor-specific telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter instead of universal cytomegalovirus promoter. Our in vitro study revealed that Tyr promoter-regulated AdRGD exhibited high transgene expression specificity for melanoma cells, and that TERT promoter-regulated AdRGD could induce efficient gene expression in tumor cells, but was relatively quiescent in normal cells. Anti-B16BL6 melanoma effects in mice injected intratumorally with AdRGD-Tyr/HSVtk or AdRGD-TERT/HSVtk, after which GCV was injected intraperitoneally for 10 days, were comparable to those in mice injected with AdRGD-CMV/HSVtk at 10 times less vector dosage. On the other hand, AdRGD-Tyr/HSVtk and AdRGD-TERT/HSVtk did not induce severe adverse effects even when they were intravenously injected into mice at 10(9) plaque-forming units (PFU), whereas mice injected with AdRGD-CMV/HSVtk at 10(8) PFU exhibited body weight reduction and serum level increase of biochemical enzymes for hepatotoxicity. These results indicate that AdRGD combined with transcriptional regulation using Tyr or TERT promoter is a potentially useful and safe vector system for suicide gene therapy for melanoma.",

Beneficial effects are widely documented concerning the treatment of neoplastic diseases in vivo as well as reductions in viability of cultured cells from melanoma, one of the most aggressive cancers in humans. However, studies of its effects on non-tumor cells in vitro have not focused on viability, except for experiments aiming to protect against oxidotoxicity or other toxicological insults. Furthermore, there is no agreement on the range of effective melatonin concentrations in vitro, and the mechanisms that reduce cell viability have remained unclear. Tumor cell-specific increases in the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) may provide a possible explanation. Our aim was to analyze the potential inhibition of tumor  (B16 melanoma 4A5) and non-tumor cell (3T3 Swiss albino) viability using a wide range of melatonin concentrations (10-11-10-2 M), and to determine whether intracellular ROS enhancement was involved in this process. In the absence of fetal bovine serum (FBS), low melatonin concentrations (10-9-10-5 M) reduced the proliferation of melanoma cells with no effect in fibroblasts, whereas, in the presence of FBS, they had no effect or even increased the proliferation of both fibroblast and melanoma cells. Melatonin concentrations in the upper millimolar range increased ROS levels and reduced the viability of both cell types, but more markedly so in non-tumor cells. Thus, low melatonin concentrations reduce proliferation in this specific melanoma cell line, whereas high concentrations affect the viability of both tumor (B16 4A5 melanoma) and non-tumor (3T3 fibroblasts) cells. Increased ROS levels in both lines indicate a role for ROS production in the reduction of cell viability at high-but not low-melatonin concentrations, although the mechanism of action still remains to be elucidated.",

MTf is expressed at very low levels in normal tissues and in high amounts in melanoma cells although its function remains elusive. To understand the function of MTf, we utilized whole-genome microarray analysis to examine the gene expression profile of five models after modulating MTf expression. These models included two new stably transfected MTf hyper-expression models (SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma and LMTK- fibroblasts) and one cell type (SK-Mel-28 melanoma) where MTf was down-regulated by post-transcriptional gene silencing. These findings were compared with alterations in gene expression identified using the MTf-/- mice. In addition, the changes identified from the microarray data were also assessed in a new model of MTf down-regulation in SK-Mel-2 melanoma cells. In the cell line models, MTf hyper-expression led to increased proliferation, whereas MTf down-regulation resulted in decreased proliferation. Across all five models of MTf down- and up-regulation, we identified three genes modulated by MTf. These included ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 5, whose change in expression mirrored MTf down- or up-regulation. In addition, thiamine triphosphatase and transcription factor 4 were inversely expressed relative to MTf levels across all five models. The products of these three genes are involved in membrane transport, thiamine phosphorylation and proliferation/survival, respectively. This study identifies novel molecular targets directly or indirectly regulated by MTf and the potential pathways involved in its function, including modulation of proliferation.",

Serum specimens were collected from 49 patients who developed recurrence (n = 25) or remained free of recurrence (n = 24) without evidence of disease following complete resection (AJCC stage I and II). Follow-up was longer than 5 years. Serum proteins were denatured and applied onto two protein chip chemistry surfaces (weak cationic WCX2; metal-binding, IMAC3-Cu). SELDI ProteinChip mass spectrometry was then performed. SELDI data were analyzed, protein peak clustering and classification were performed, and a supervised classification algorithm was employed to classify the dataset. Multiple protein peaks ranging from 3.3 to 30 kDa were identified between patients with recurrence and those without recurrence, and the expression pattern differences of three proteins were used to generate the discriminating classification tree. The biomarkers were expressed with a high degree of reproducibility. In this early characterization study, melanoma recurrence was predicted with a sensitivity of 72% (18/25) and a specificity of 75% (18/24).

The CTL lines generated were found to kill not only autologous melanoma, but also allogeneic melanomas having class I HLA-A antigens shared or \"cross-reactive\" with autologous HLA-A. These CTL lines were poor killers of melanomas bearing non-shared or non-cross-reactive HLA-A. Cold-target inhibition assays demonstrated this CTL cross-reactivity to allogeneic melanoma specificity. Epstein-Barr-virus-transformed autologous and allogeneic B lymphoblastoid cell lines failed to block autologous melanoma killing, indicating that CTL were not recognizing major histocompatibility complex antigens, serum proteins or culture medium products as the primary target antigen. HLA-A2 was the major shared HLA-A antigen recognized by CTL lines on the melanoma lines studied. CTL lines also recognized shared HLA-A11 and A24 on allogeneic melanoma. There were no CTL lines showing restriction to HLA-B. These results suggest that common tumor-associated antigens are present on melanomas and are recognized in association with distinct HLA-A epitopes by CTL.",

Angiogenesis has been considered important in melanoma progression, and endostatin is an angiogenesis inhibitor with antitumor activity that has shown promising results in murine model systems, prompting investigation of a formulation of rh-Endostatin (EntreMed, Rockville, Maryland, USA) alone and with interferon in metastatic melanoma. Patients were randomly assigned to receive interferon alpha2b (Schering-Plough) 10 million units/m(2) subcutaneously three times a week plus rh-Endostatin 45 mg/m(2) subcutaneously every 12 h (arm A) vs. rh-Endostatin alone (arm B). Twenty-one patients (age range 31-77 years, median age 54, 12 men and nine women, 17 cutaneous, and four ocular melanomas) were enrolled. No antitumor responses were observed, and no significant differences were noted in time to progression or overall survival. Two patients had stable disease enduring more than 30 weeks on treatment. Serum endostatin levels increased significantly 4 weeks after treatment in both groups. Basic fibroblast growth factor levels in urine were significantly lower following treatment in patients on arm B (P=0.043). The percentage of circulating endothelial cells was increased in five evaluable patients 4 weeks after treatment. Low titer (<or=1:25) IgG antibodies against the rh-Endo formulation were detected in two patients (one per arm) in cycle 4. In conclusion, interferon did not improve response rate of rh-Endo although prolonged disease stability was observed in two patients. Better laboratory correlates of antiangiogenic response are needed, and the predictive value of circulating endothelial cells warrants further evaluation.",

In the intracellular region of the melanoma cells, TPI activity was localized mainly in the cytosol fraction. The difference in specific activities between the intracellular and extracellular TPI and the TPI accumulation in the culture media indicated that cultured melanoma cells release TPI. Partial purification and characterization of the TPI by column chromatography using Sephadex G-150, papain-Sepharose, and Sephadex G-50, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed two distinct TPIs with molecular weights of 56,000 and 9,800 to 10,800. The latter (main) TPI had a high specificity for thiol proteases and was heat stable (60 degrees for 60 min), like previously reported normal human TPIs. The inhibitor, however, differed from normal human TPIs in that it had a lower molecular weight than any normal TPI, was unable to inhibit bromelain, and exhibited a mosaic pattern; namely, the low-molecular-weight TPI resembled liver-type TPI but the pH stability curve resembled serum-type TPI.

These sublines were used to identify the production of substances by other melanoma cells in culture that would supplement or replace the requirement for serum. Most of the sublines showed higher colony-forming efficiency in medium conditioned by one of several cell types in the presence of a low concentration of serum (2.5%) compared with fresh medium containing a high concentration of serum (10%). The conditioning factor(s) were found to be moderately heat-stable, nonlipophilic, and to be of low molecular weight (less than or greater than 400). Screening of a variety of non-essential low molecular weight nutrients, which have been reported to potentiate the growth of a variety of cell types in low-density culture, was positive for the MM96 sublines only for pyruvate. In particular, L-alanine, L-serine, putrescine and alpha MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone) were ineffective. Despite the problems of comparing conditioned media with fresh medium, a reasonable correlation between the stimulatory effect and the cell content of added 2-oxocarboxylates was apparent. As would be anticipated, MM96 cultures showed a population density-dependent enhancement of growth up to a cell density of 2 to 4 x 10(4) cells cm-2. Further increase in the initial cell density of these cultures led to a decline in growth rate. An important additional observation was that simple dilution of the ingredients of RPMI1640 with phosphate-buffered saline or Hanks' balanced salt solution led to a reversal of growth inhibition accompanying a serum shift-down.",

The two cell lines failed to arrest in G0 following serum deprivation, and responded to INS and MSA but not to EGF, PDGF or FGF. Only MeWo-LC1 cells divided persistently in completely serum-free medium, and formed a high percentage of spheroids in agarose supplemented or not with serum or individual growth factors. The conditioned media of serum-free cultures of MeWo and MeWo-LC1 cells exhibited mitogenic activities. These were detected without prior concentration, fractionation or acid treatment. They stimulated DNA replication into sparse monolayers of autologous (MeWo, MeWo-LC1) or homologous (SK-MEL28 melanoma) cells and into NRK-49F normal rat fibroblasts, and acted in synergy with INS in a dose-dependent manner. Over a period of 5 days in culture, MeWo-LC1 cells produced bioactive material at a 2 to 3-fold higher rate than MeWo cells, in both the absence and presence of INS. MeWo-LC1-conditioned medium promoted or enhanced colony formation of MeWo and NRK-49F cells plated in serum-free (+/- INS) agarose. The two cell lines expressed the same amount of NGF and EGF receptors. On the basis of these results we suggest that: (i) MeWo and MeWo-LC1 melanoma cells have obviated allocrine stimulation of the division process characteristic of normal cells by responding to their own mitogens; (ii) some of these mitogens are akin to TGFs; (iii) the less efficient synthesis of autostimulatory factors by MeWo cells may account for their weaker proliferative capacity in vitro, and possibly in vivo.",

Interferon alpha2b (IFNalpha2b/IFNalpha2) has been used in high doses to treat melanoma.

Pegylation has been used to overcome this, but in itself possesses a host of other issues such as decrease receptor binding, nonspecific chemical derivatization, low overall yields, and additional purification steps. An alternative to this produces IFN as arabinogalactan fusion proteins in plant cells. These IFN analogs bind to IFN receptors and follow the IFN-induced Janus Kinase 1-signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling pathway. Here, we show that these fusion proteins of higher molecular weight also cause similar growth inhibition and affect cell cycle distribution in melanoma cells M92-047 and SK MEL-28.

In normal subjects serum melatonin ranges from 0.47 to 0.65 nmol/l or 1.44 to 2.14 pg/mg serum protein. In contrast, in melanoma patients melatonin content of the serum varies between 2.07 to 6.20 nmol/l or 9.70 to 20.86 pg/mg serum protein.

In melanoma patients, the melatonin level was 1.65 +/- 0.10 nmol/l serum or 9.82 +/- 1.02 pg/mg protein.

The various components of the linear Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway have been implicated in various tumours. We therefore investigated the role of Raf-1 and the MEK/ERK module in the proliferation of human normal choroidal melanocytes (NCM) and cells from the ocular choroidal melanoma (OCM-1) cell line. OCM-1 cells proliferated four times faster than NCM. High basal activation of the MEK/ERK module was observed in unstimulated OCM-1 cells, whereas rapid and persistent activation was detected after serum stimulation, throughout the 24-h period of culture. In contrast, the activation of MEK/ERK was barely detectable in unstimulated NCM and occurred late (6 h) after the stimulation of cell proliferation. Inhibition of Raf-1 and MEK1/2 activation by pharmacological approaches and of the production of Raf-1 and ERK1/2 by antisense oligonucleotide approaches demonstrated that Raf-1 and the MEK/ERK module controlled proliferation in OCM-1 cells, but not in NCM. OCM-1 cells produced very low levels of p27Kip1, whereas NCM produced constant, high levels of p27Kip1. The inhibition of Raf-1 or MEK1/2 induced a large increase in p27Kip1 in OCM-1 cells, associated with an arrest of cell proliferation. Levels of c-Myc production were high and constant in OCM-1 cells and low in NCM, in contrast to what was observed for p27Kip1. The inhibition of both Raf-1 and MEK1/2 induced a decrease in c-Myc production and downregulated c-Myc activity by preventing c-Myc phosphorylation in OCM-1 cells. We conclude that Raf-1 and the MEK/ERK module control the production of both p27Kip1 and c-Myc, and the activation of c-Myc for OCM-1 cell proliferation.",

Soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) is an immunological marker that may also serve as an indicator of tumour progression. Normal and neoplastic cells are capable of releasing these molecules into circulation. We evaluated the association between pretreatment serum levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1) and sIL-2R and metastases and survival in 50 patients with advanced melanoma. The patients with liver and/or bone metastases had significantly higher sICAM-1 levels than those with soft tissue and/or lung involvement (P=0.002). In addition, there was a trend towards higher sIL-2R levels in patients with more metastatic sites (P=0.07). In univariate analysis, the number of metastatic sites (P=0.0001, odds ratio (OR) 3.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7-5.3), the metastatic site (P=0.01, OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.2-4.4) and the levels of sICAM-1 (P=0.011, OR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.2-5.0), sVCAM-1 (P=0.036, OR 2.1, 95% CI: 1.0-4.3) and sIL-2R (P=0.0016, OR 3.0, 95% CI: 1.5-6.0) were found to be statistically significant prognostic factors for survival. In multivariate analysis, the number of metastatic sites was the dominant prognostic indicator. After it was excluded from the analysis, the sIL-2R level and the metastatic site were found to be significant. It can be concluded, that high sICAM-1 levels suggest liver metastases and sIL-2R seems to serve as a marker of tumour load in metastatic melanoma. Furthermore, the sIL-2R level appears to add to clinical data predicting the patient's outcome.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancer patients undergoing treatment with systemic cancer chemotherapy drugs often have abnormal growth factor and cytokine profiles. Thus, serum levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8) are elevated in patients with malignant melanoma. In addition to IL-8, aggressive melanoma cells secrete, through its transcriptional regulator hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes angiogenesis and metastasis of human cancerous cells. Whether these responses are related to adenosine, a ubiquitous mediator expressed at high concentrations in cancer and implicated in numerous inflammatory processes, is not known and is the focus of this study. We have examined whether the DNA-damaging agents etoposide (VP-16) and doxorubicin can affect IL-8, VEGF, and HIF-1 expressions in human melanoma cancer cells. In particular, we have investigated whether these responses are related to the modulation of the adenosine receptor subtypes, namely, A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3). We have demonstrated that A(2B) receptor blockade can impair IL-8 production, whereas blocking A(3) receptors, it is possible to further decrease VEGF secretion in melanoma cells treated with VP-16 and doxorubicin. This understanding may present the possibility of using adenosine antagonists to reduce chemotherapy-induced inflammatory cytokine production and to improve the ability of chemotherapeutic drugs to block angiogenesis. Consequently, we conclude that adenosine receptor modulation may be useful for refining the use of chemotherapeutic drugs to treat human cancer more effectively.",

To determine if tumour selectivity results from a preferential uptake or prolonged retention of photosensitizers, intravital fluorescence microscopy and chemical extraction were used. Amelanotic melanoma (A-Mel-3) were implanted in a skin fold chamber in Syrian Golden hamsters. Distribution of the porphyrin mixture Photofrin and three porphycenes, pure porphyrinoid model compounds, was studied quantitatively by intravital fluorescence microscopy. Extraction of tissue and blood samples was performed to verify and supplement intravital microscopic results. Photofrin accumulated in melanomas reaching a maximum tumour:skin tissue ratio of 1.7:1. Localisation of the different porphycenes was found to be highly tumour selective (3.2:1), anti-tumour selective (0.2:1), and non-selective (1:1) with increasing polarity of the porphycenes. The two non-tumour selective porphycenes had distinctly accelerated serum and tissue kinetics; serum halflife times being as short as 1 min. The specific localisation of the slowly distributed, tumour selective photosensitizers, occurred exclusively during the distribution from serum and uptake into tissues. For the most selective porphycene, the tumour selection process had a halflife of 260 +/- 150 min and led to a strongly fluorescent tumour edge edema. Accumulation of porphyrines by the amelanotic melanoma (A-Mel-3) can be attributed to an enhanced uptake rate for lipophilic molecules in this subcutaneously growing neoplasm. The slow distribution of the two tumour specific photosensitizers and the strong fluorescence of these hydrophobic molecules in the tumour compartment with a high water content indicate a carrier role of serum proteins in the selection process. Enhanced permeability of the tumour vasculature to macromolecules appears to be the most probable reason for the tumour selectivity of these two sensitisers.",

White blood cells (WBCs) and lymphocyte numbers, lymphocyte subpopulations, serum concentrations of IFN-alpha and anti-IFN-alpha antibodies, and the serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-8, and basis fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) concentrations were determined over time in resected, recurrence-free patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage III melanoma with one or less (LN+ < or = 1, n = 7) or more than one (LN+ > 1, n = 8) lymph nodes involved, and AJCC stage IV resected disease (n = 7).

C57BL mice received a subcutaneous injection of B16 melanoma cells to induce formation of tumors, prior to antitumor treatments with native and immobilized BSAO. The enzyme was immobilized in a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) biocompatible matrix. Antitumor treatments consisted of a single injection of enzyme into the tumor. When immobilized BSAO (2.5mU) was injected into the tumor, there was a marked decrease of 70% of the tumor growth. This was compared with a decrease of only 32% of tumor size when the same amount of native BSAO was administered. The type of cell death was analysed in tumors that were treated with native or immobilized BSAO. When tumors were treated with immobilized BSAO, there was induction of a high level of apoptosis (around 70%), compared to less than 10% with the native enzyme. Apoptotic cell death was assessed by nuclear chromatin condensation using Hoechst staining and labelling of externalized phosphatidylserine using Annexin V. However, native BSAO, probably due to a burst of cytotoxic products, induced a high level of necrosis of about 40%, compared to less than 10% with immobilized BSAO. In conclusion, the advantage is that immobilized BSAO can act by allowing the slow release of cytotoxic products, which induces tumor cell death by apoptosis rather than necrosis.",

Liposomes containing muramyl tripeptide (MLV MTP-PE) can activate monocytes from cancer patients in vitro and in vivo, making them cytotoxic such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the levels of sICAM-1 and their possible correlation with serum inflammatory cytokine levels in melanoma patients treated with MLV MTP-PE.;The sera from 9 patients with metastatic melanoma treated with MLV MTP-PE, 4 mg i.v. twice a week for 12 weeks, were tested in ELISA system to detect sICAM-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6, Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) before, and 2 and 24 h after the 1st, 12th and 24th infusion of MLV MTP-PE.;Baseline levels of sICAM-1 were elevated in all patients (median 540 ng/ml: range 400-1030 ng/ml). Twenty-four h after the 1st infusion of MLV MTP-PE, we observed 6 increases in sICAM-1 levels, 1 decrease and 2 stable values (median 720 ng/ml: range 410-1820; P = 0.060). Twenty-four h after the 12th infusion, sICAM-1 increased in 3 patients and did not change in 4 (median 790 ng/ml: range 495-1650 ng/ml; P = 0.069). At the 24th infusion, sICAM-1 increased in 4 of 6 evaluable patients and remained stable in 2 (median 802 ng/ml: range 510-1450 ng/ml; P = 0.045). To better analyze the variations in sICAM-1, the patients were arbitrarily divided into two groups according to their clinical behavior: 4 presented stabilization (all lesions, n = 2; some lesions, n = 2) (Group A); 5 presented progressive disease (Group B). In Group A, sICAM-1 levels remained stable or showed a modest increase during treatment (except in 1 patient, who exhibited a substantial variation after the 12th infusion). In contrast, in Group B very high levels of sICAM-1 were observed at the beginning of the study therapy in 1 patient and after the 1st infusion in 3 patients; these values remained high until the 24th infusion. In most of the patients, TNF-alpha and IL-6 increased after the 1st infusion, but not thereafter. IFN-gamma was never detected; IL-1 beta was detectable in a few cases, but only before the infusions.;baseline levels of sICAM-1 were elevated in all patients and further increased during treatment only in patients with more aggressive disease. No correlation was found between sICAM-1 and inflammatory cytokines.

In the present study the relationships between daily or seasonal UV radiation doses and vitamin D status, dietary vitamin D intake and CMM incidence rates at different geographical latitudes were investigated. North-South gradients of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) generation and CMM induction were calculated, based on known action spectra, and compared with measured vitamin D levels and incidence rates of CMM. The relative roles of UVA and UVB in CMM induction are discussed. Latitudinal dependencies of serum 25(OH)D levels and CMM incidence rates can only partly be explained by ambient UV doses. The UV sensitivity is different among populations with different skin color. This is well known for CMM, but seems also to be true for vitamin D status. The fact that UV-induced vitamin D may reduce the risk of CMM complicates the discussion. To some extent high dietary vitamin D intake seems to compensate low UV doses. ",

One hypothyroid patient had elevated serum antimicrosomal antibody titres before the start of treatment and two others responded similarly during therapy. Three of the sixteen euthyroid patients also developed elevated titres of this antibody. Partial or complete remission was observed in seven of the patients--three of the four with hypothyroidism showed tumour regression. Thus IL-2 and IFN-alpha 2 can cause hypothyroidism, presumably via induction or exacerbation of autoimmune thyroid reactions. The occurrence of hypothyroidism may be mediated by high-dose IL-2 (rather than by LAK cell therapy as previously suggested) and potentiated by IFN-alpha 2.",

However, the short half-life of recombinant IL-2 protein in serum requires repeated high-dose injections, resulting in severe side effects. Although adenovirus-mediated IL-2 gene therapy has shown antitumor efficacy, the host antibody response to adenoviral particles and potential biosafety concerns still obstruct its clinical applications. Here we report a novel nanopolymer for IL-2 delivery, consisting of low molecular weight polyethylenimine (600 Da) linked by β-cyclodextrin and conjugated with folate (named H1). H1 was mixed with IL-2 plasmid to form H1/pIL-2 polyplexes of around 100 nm in diameter. Peritumoral injection of these polyplexes suppressed the tumor growth and prolonged the survival of C57/BL6 mice bearing B16-F1 melanoma grafts. Importantly, the antitumor effects of H1/pIL-2 (50 μg DNA) were similar to those of recombinant adenoviruses expressing IL-2 (rAdv-IL-2; 2 × 10(8) pfu). Furthermore, we showed that H1/pIL-2 stimulated the activation and proliferation of CD8+, CD4+ T cell, and natural killer cells in peripheral blood and increased the infiltration of CD8+, CD4+ Tcells, and natural killer cells into the tumor environment. In conclusion, these results show that H1/pIL-2 is an effective and safe melanoma therapeutic with an efficacy comparable to that of rAdv-IL-2.

The tests for S-100beta were most frequently positive in the first 3 months after surgery. Results of the assays did not show a strong correlation with clinical stage of the disease. Studies on a cohort of 147 patients who had been followed for a minimum of 2 years post-surgery were carried out to assess the sensitivity of the assays for identifying patients who develop recurrence of their melanoma. The LIA-mat and IRMA assays detected S-100beta in the serum of 47.5% and 23%, respectively, of the subset of 61 patients who developed recurrence of disease. By Kaplan Meler analysis, patients positive for S-100beta by LIA-mat assay in the first 3 months post-surgery were shown to have an approximately 2.7 times shorter disease-free survival (DFS) period than patients negative for S-100beta. This was significant by log rank analysis. Multivariate analysis indicated that the presence of S-100beta was an independent prognostic determinant of DFS, and was independent of tumour thickness and lymph node status. This prospective analysis in a large number of patients suggests that assays for S-100beta in patients following surgical resection of AJCC stage I-III melanoma are of limited value for identifying patients who will develop recurrence of their disease.

This method of immunization induced a significant but transient fall in the specific inhibitory effects of the sera on tumour directed cytotoxic activity of the patients' lymphocytes. In a pilot group of 30 patients with disseminated malignant melanoma being treated with chemotherapy (DTIC and vincristine) the immunotherapy was given midway between courses of the cytotoxic drugs. There was a correlation between the effects on circulating inhibitor and clinical outcome. The number of objective regressions occurring in this small pilot group was surprisingly high (17/30) and these clinical effects, although obtained in a series without concurrent controls, are presented for discussion.

The downside risks related to testing are cost and patient anxiety. Therefore, it must be critically considered which examinations are useful and feasible. After a diagnosis of primary cutaneous melanoma, many physicians in Germany perform lymph node ultrasound to detect occult regional metastasis. Whole-body imaging techniques, except the physical examination, are unlikely to detect distant occult metastasis. In tumors that have an intermediate or high risk of recurrence (> 1 mm tumor thickness), baseline whole-body imaging may serve as a reference for ongoing evaluation. During follow-up care, physical examination alone is appropriate when there is a low risk for recurrence (up to 1-mm tumor thickness). In patients whose tumors are > 1 mm thickness, regular lymph node ultrasound examinations and determination of serum tumor marker S-100beta protein are commonly used by physicians in Germany. Whole-body imaging techniques are useful in patients who have locoregional and/or distant metastasis. For consideration of surgical resections in stage IV disease, more advanced examinations techniques such as positron emission tomography-computed tomography or whole body magnetic resonance imaging may be used. Early detection of limited disease using these methods may be helpful for patients who have locoregional metastases and for 10-20% of patients who have distant metastases and whose limited disease may be amenable to surgical resection.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The stimulation of protoporphyrin (PP) biosynthesis in B16 melanoma cells in order to facilitate photodynamic cell killing was studied. Biosynthesis and accumulation of PP in the melanoma cells was increased from 8 to 15 pmol/mg protein by the use of dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO), a differentiation-inducer. Treatment of the cells with the porphyrogenic agent allylisopropyl-acetamide (AIA) stimulated an additional PP increase. The most remarkable enhancement of intracellular PP was achieved by the supplementation of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) to the growth medium following the addition of DMSO and AIA during the induction phase. The intracellular concentration of PP exceeded 21,950 pmol/mg protein following combined stimulation by DMSO/AIA and 5-ALA. The porphyrins produced in the incubated cells, in serum-depleted medium, consisted of 95% PP; 88% of it was recovered from the cells and only 7% was excreted into the medium. Photosensitization of the B16 melanoma cells containing high PP concentrations was effective even at low light doses. Potassium (K) efflux was the first measurable sign of cell damage determined by X-ray microanalysis (XRMA) following fast liquid-nitrogen fixation. During a 1 min interval, 70% of cellular K was lost. After 5 min illumination, complete cell destruction was detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and XRMA. The photodamaged cells showed influx of Na, Cl and Ca ions accompanying the immediate K losses. Ultrastructural cell damage was manifested by disintegration of the outer membrane. Total cell death of B16 melanoma cells was achieved by chemical induction of endogenous PP and photosensitization.",

Because ipilimumab targets T lymphocytes and not the tumor itself, efficacy may be uniquely sensitive to immunomodulatory factors present at the time of treatment. We analyzed serum from patients with metastatic melanoma (247 of 273, 90.4%) randomly assigned to receive ipilimumab or gp100 peptide vaccine. We quantified candidate biomarkers at baseline and assessed the association of each using multivariate analyses. Results were confirmed in an independent cohort of similar patients (48 of 52, 92.3%) treated with ipilimumab. After controlling for baseline covariates, elevated chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 11 (CXCL11) and soluble MHC class I polypeptide-related chain A (sMICA) were associated with poor OS in ipilimumab-treated patients [log10 CXCL11: HR, 1.88; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.14-3.12; P = 0.014; and log10 sMICA quadratic effect P = 0.066; sMICA (≥ 247 vs. 247): HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.02-3.01].

The addition of fetal bovine serum to melanoma and astrocytoma cells growing in synthetic medium (insulin-transferrin-selenium) resulted in reactivity with Ab32-27M. As antibody 32-27M detects N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc)-containing gangliosides, the effect of adding a number of different gangliosides to melanoma and astrocytoma cells cultured in the synthetic medium was studied. Only the addition of NeuGc-GM3 resulted in the development of Ab32-27M reactivity. The identity of the antigenic structures developed after addition of fetal bovine serum or NeuGc-GM3 was determined by analysis of the gangliosides from both samples. The major component detected in melanoma cell lines was shown to be N-acetylneuraminic acid-NeuGc-GD3. Another, slower moving component, present in some melanomas and in astrocytomas may be N-acetylneuraminic acid-NeuGc-GD2. The cell type specificity for these processes can be most readily explained by postulating that all cells can take up exogenous gangliosides but only melanoma and astrocytoma cells have sufficiently high levels of GM3 alpha 2----8-sialyltransferase for the conversion of added NeuGc-GM3 to disialogangliosides to be effective. These results demonstrate a novel pathway for exogenous glycolipid processing that can lead to novel Ag expression but may also play a role in normal glycolipid metabolism and function.",

Response rates and duration of response following ILI are similar to those after ILP. Previously we have shown that more significant limb toxicity is not associated with a higher response rate or improved patient outcome. In this study we sought to determine factors predicting toxicity following ILI.;From our prospective database 185 patients with advanced metastatic melanoma of the limb treated with a single ILI between 1992 and 2007 were identified. In all patients a cytotoxic combination of melphalan and actinomycin D was used. Drug circulation time was 20-30 min under mild hyperthermic conditions (38-39 degrees C). Limb toxicity was assessed using the Wieberdink scale.;The average patient age was 74 years (range 29-93 years) and 62% were female. Most patients (134/185) had MD Anderson stage III disease (satellites and in-transit metastases). Toxicity grade I (no reaction) occurred in 3 patients, grade II (slight erythema and edema) in 105 patients, grade III (considerable erythema and edema +/- blistering) in 72 patients, and grade IV (threatened or actual compartment syndrome) in 5 patients. No patient developed grade V toxicity (requiring amputation). On univariate analysis high peak and high final melphalan concentrations were found to be predictive factors for grade III/IV limb toxicity as well as the area under the curve of the melphalan concentration. Surprisingly, a greater rise in the CO(2) level during the procedure was associated with lower toxicity in the univariate analysis. Increased serum creatine phosphokinase (CK) postoperatively was related to higher toxicity score. In the multivariate analysis high final melphalan concentration and shorter tourniquet time were independent predictive risk factors for developing grade III/IV limb toxicity.;ILI is a safe alternative to the more invasive and laborious ILP technique to treat melanoma confined to a limb. Regional acute toxicity following ILI is mild to moderate in most patients. Based on the predictive factors found in this series, altering melphalan dose and tourniquet time may allow further reductions in post-ILI toxicity without compromising effectiveness.",

Among 40 cell lines, the eight lines that revealed neither BRAF nor NRAS mutations showed even higher levels of BRAF mRNA expression than the 32 mutated lines, although DNA amplification at 7q33-q34 was not detected in every lines overexpressing BRAF. MM cells that carried wild-type BRAF and NRAS showed constitutive overexpression of B-Raf protein and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), even after serum starvation. Not only downregulation of the endogenously overexpressed wild-type B-Raf by antisense oligonucleotide but also a treatment with an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK, MEK) reduced phosphorylated ERK1/2 and cell growth, whereas the exogenously expressed wild-type B-Raf promoted cell growth in MM cells.

When cultured in a chemically defined medium containing EGF, transferrin, and selenium, IGR39 cells display many neurite-like extensions. Following these morphological changes, the specific [125I]VIP binding is increased four- to fivefold after 6 days in culture. This phenomenon is reversible and is the result of an increased number of VIP binding sites available at the cell surface, without modification of their affinities. The molecular mass of the binding sites is also unchanged whatever cell culture conditions. Increase in [125I]VIP binding is inversely correlated to the serum concentration in the culture medium. When added to the chemically defined medium, sera from various origins as well as some serum substitutes reduce [125I]VIP binding to the same extent as that of the serum. The total cAMP production by VIP-stimulated IGR39 cells is enhanced by a factor of six to seven when cells are cultured in serum-free medium, in good correlation with the increase of VIP binding capacity.

The FD determinant is carried by a Mr 90,000 glycoprotein (gp90) that binds to concanavalin A but not to lentil lectin or wheat germ agglutinin. After treatment with endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, the antigen no longer bound to concanavalin A. These and other properties indicate the gp90 carries mainly high mannose or hybrid N-linked carbohydrate chains. gp90 was partially purified from a detergent-solubilized membrane preparation by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, chelating Sepharose, and lectin-agarose columns. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of the final preparation revealed three major components, one of which was identified as the FD antigen since it was specifically removed by precipitation with serum from patient FD. Immunization with the partially purified antigen preparation elicited anti-gp90 antibodies in two of four mice as demonstrated by sequential radioimmunoprecipitation experiments. Absorption experiments demonstrated that the mouse antibodies could, unlike human FD serum, be absorbed by a number of different cell types. Based on these results it is proposed that gp90 in SK-MEL-131 cells has two distinct epitopes, one, unique, detected by autologous FD serum, and another, common epitope or epitopes, detected by the polyclonal mouse sera. The common epitope(s) is present on gp90 in a variety of cells, including allogeneic melanomas and FD-B cells. These findings, which are compared with those on mouse tumor rejection antigens, have clear implications for the understanding of the nature of tumor antigens.",

Attempts to grow the cells in glass spinners in Dulbecco's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum produced cell aggregates growing in suspension. When calcium-free suspension culture media (Joklik, DME-S, McCoy 5A-S) were used, single cell suspension cultures were obtained and high Epo production observed. When attempts were made to scale up the small glass spinners, poor growth or Epo production occurred unless the vessels were aerated. This was shown to be because of the drop in pH, possibly due to CO2 accumulation, rather than due to oxygen depletion. It was shown that a semi-continuous operation could be achieved in aerated 8-1 spinners fitted with either a conventional stirrer or a vibromixer agitator. The system was scaled up to a 100-1 stainless steel vessel fitted with a vibromixer agitator. This system was operated for over 4 months with weekly harvests producing over 100 million units of Epo in about 1000-1 of culture fluid.

At least one of them seemed to be a small acidic and basic stable peptide without disulfide bounds but not heat stable. The synthesis of at least one of these cytotoxic factors was inhibited by cycloheximide and the cytotoxic activity was partially destroyed by pronase and trypsin, but not by pepsin.

In 43 of these melanoma patients, sequential determination of antibody titer was made and correlated with clinical course. Low titers of antibody to BCG were found frequently in normal volunteers and in melanoma patients prior to BCG immunotherapy. The typical response to BCG immunotherapy was a rapid rise of antibody titer to high levels. Six of 19 patients with recurrence had disappearance of antibody preceding clinical recurrence by up to 5 months. In 13 of 40 patients receiving BCG, serum antibody was a better indicator of the patient's response than measurement of delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity to purified protein derivative. These results suggest that measurement of the antibody response to BCG may be useful in developing an optimum mode of BCG immunotherapy as well as predicting clinical recurrence in patients with melanoma.",

Recent studies have suggested that mild hyperthermic (38 degrees C) ILI might be the best initial treatment for extensively recurrent limb melanoma given its simplicity, low morbidity and a complete response rate of 30 - 40%.;Since 1994 when ILI was first described by Thompson et al., the procedure has been adopted by several centres around the world; research and improvements in the technique have resulted in reduction in limb toxicity without reducing its clinical efficacy. The pharmacokinetics of melphalan and the clinical efficacy and adverse effects of ILI from various centres are summarised. Minor but possibly important differences in the ILI techniques used in different institutions may be important in improving its efficacy and reducing the toxic effects.;An understanding of the efficacy and toxicity associated with ILI with cytotoxic drugs in melanoma patients and of methods to optimise regional therapy for malignant disease in a limb.;ILI with mild hyperthermia (38 degrees C) is well tolerated with tumour remission rates in melanoma patients similar to those achieved by isolated limb perfusion. Mild (grade I - II) and moderate/severe (grade > or = III) limb toxicities occur in 58 - 68% and 32 - 41% of patients, respectively, but long-term morbidity is rare. A high peak and high final melphalan concentration in the infusate, the AUC of melphalan concentration in the infusate and an increased postoperative serum creatine phosphokinase concentration are factors predictive of acute regional toxicity. Drug dose adjusted for ideal body weight and gender may reduce acute toxicity following ILI. It has been suggested that the use of papaverine prior to the infusion of melphalan might increase its efficacy, but it may also increase toxicity. Large prospective studies are needed to more accurately define the perioperative factors that influence acute regional toxicity after ILI and to establish strategies to optimise clinical outcome.",

We previously showed that high concentrations of the CXCR4 ligand, wild-type CXCL12 (wtCXCL12), could inhibit colorectal cancer metastasis in vivo, and we have hypothesized that wtCXCL12 dimerizes at high concentration to become a potent antagonist of CXCR4. To address this hypothesis, we engineered a covalently locked, dimeric variant of CXCL12 (CXCL122). Herein, we show that CXCL122 can not only inhibit implantation of lung metastasis of CXCR4-B16-F10 melanoma cells more effectively than AMD3100, but that CXCL122 also blocks the growth of established pulmonary tumors. To identify a basis for the in vivo efficacy of CXCL122, we conducted Western blot analysis and ELISA analyses, which revealed that CXCL122 was stable for at least 12 hours in serum, whereas wtCXCL12 was quickly degraded. CXCL122 also maintained its antagonist properties in in vitro chemotaxis assays for up to 24 hours in serum, whereas wtCXCL12 was ineffective after 6 hours. Heat-inactivation of serum prolonged the stability and function of wtCXCL12 by more than 6 hours, suggesting enzymatic degradation as a possible mechanism for wtCXCL12 inactivation. In vitro analysis of amino-terminal cleavage by enzymes dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV/CD26) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) resulted in 25-fold and 2-fold slower degradation rates, respectively, of CXCL122 compared with wtCXCL12. In summary, our results suggest CXCL122 possesses greater potential as an antimetastatic drug as compared with AMD3100 or wtCXCL12, potentially due to enhanced serum stability in the presence of N-terminal degrading enzymes.",

(1991). Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88, 164-168]. Separate lines of these animals differ genetically only in the number of copies and chromosomal site of integration of the transgene. Skin melanocytes from young mice with no apparent skin lesions were established in continuous culture from hemizygous donors with low, medium and high numbers of transgene copies, and from a homozygous offspring of the low-copy mouse line. The standard culture conditions enable C57BL/6 wild-type melanocytes to become stably immortalized without transformation. The transgenic cell lines all changed over time in an orderly progression. However, with greater numbers of transgene copies, the cells more rapidly displayed shorter doubling times, increased anchorage independence, reduced serum and growth factor requirements, decreased tyrosinase expression and melanin content, increased oncogene expression, and capacity to form malignant melanomas when tested by grafting. Melanocytes with the lowest number of transgene copies were of special interest. They grew more rapidly than the wild-type cells from the outset, but did not become tumorigenic until an apparently small number of still-unknown genetic changes had spontaneously occurred, or until the number of transgene copies was increased slightly by homozygosity. In contrast to the hemizygous low-copy cells, the homozygous counterparts underwent striking and rapid transformational changes and early conversion to malignancy. Thus such low-copy transgenic melanocyte lines afford an exceptional opportunity for molecular analysis of somatic genetic evolution toward malignant melanoma.",

B16 mouse melanoma expresses GM3 and constitutes an appropriate model for the development of novel GM3-based vaccines. Recently, we hydrophobically incorporated purified GM3 into the outer membrane protein complex from Neisseria meningitidis to form very small size proteoliposomes (GM3/VSSP). We have examined the antitumour properties of GM3/VSSP vaccine and compared it with GM3 incorporated in very low density serum lipoproteins (GM3/VLDL). Immunization with four doses of GM3/VSSP vaccine (120 microg of ganglioside) plus Freund's adjuvant or Montanide ISA 51 significantly increased the overall survival of mice inoculated in the subcutis with 103 B16-F1 cells, whereas the GM3/VLDL immunogen was ineffective. The non-transient character of tumour protection was confirmed in animals surviving the first challenge and re-inoculated with 5 x 103 cells. GM3/VSSP vaccine also reduced the subcutaneous growth of highly aggressive B16-F10 cells. The importance of ganglioside structure in the tumour-protective effect of GM3/VSSP vaccine was confirmed using GM3 containing N-glycolylneuraminic acid, a ganglioside absent in melanoma cells. Immunostaining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments showed a high specificity of immune sera against GM3 and the presence of all four IgG subclasses, with a preponderance of IgG2b and IgG3. In addition, a strong anti-B16 complement-mediated cytotoxicity was induced by vaccination with GM3/VSSP. The present data indicate the molecular specificity of GM3/VSSP vaccine as well as the adjuvant-dependent and non-transient character of tumour protection in the B16 mouse model. These findings suggest that an appropriate GM3 vaccine may be capable of inducing prolonged tumour protection in melanoma patients.",

Here, we evaluated the antitumor activity of adoptively transferred human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) genetically engineered to secrete single-chain IL12 selectively at the tumor site.;Thirty-three patients with metastatic melanoma were treated in a cell dose-escalation trial of autologous TILs transduced with a gene encoding a single-chain IL12 driven by a nuclear factor of the activated T cells promoter (NFAT.IL12). No IL2 was administered.;The administration of 0.001 to 0.1 × 10(9) NFAT.IL12-transduced TILs to 17 patients resulted in a single, objective response (5.9%). However, at doses between 0.3 and 3 × 10(9) cells, 10 of 16 patients (63%) exhibited objective clinical responses. The responses tended to be short, and the administered IL12-producing cells rarely persisted at 1 month. Increasing cell doses were associated with high serum levels of IL12 and IFNγ as well as clinical toxicities, including liver dysfunction, high fevers, and sporadic life-threatening hemodynamic instability.;In this first-in-man trial, administration of TILs transduced with an inducible IL12 gene mediated tumor responses in the absence of IL2 administration using cell doses 10- to 100-fold lower than conventional TILs. However, due to toxicities, likely attributable to the secreted IL12, further refinement will be necessary before this approach can be safely used in the treatment of cancer patients.",

Normally expressed CAMs, such as E-cadherin, are lost, while others, i.e., ICAM-1, VCAM-1, NCAM, and E-selectin, are altered and overexpressed in progressive disease and metastases. Abnormal levels of these latter CAMs have been observed in melanoma and carcinomas of the colon and breast, and NCAM is overexpressed in small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). The objective of this study was to determine if serum levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, NCAM, and E-selectin could differentiate patients with benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH) from those with prostate carcinoma (CaP) and identify prostate cancers with high potential for progression to metastatic disease.;Serum levels of these CAMs were determined by ELISA in serum from normal males and females and from patients with BPH and CaP before and after treatment. Sera from patients with breast carcinoma, colon carcinoma, melanoma, and small-cell lung carcinoma were also evaluated, as soluble CAMs have been reported to be elevated in these cancer patients.;ICAM-1 levels were elevated in sera from patients with breast carcinoma (P = 0.0004) and melanoma (P = 0.0001). VCAM-1 levels were elevated in sera from patients with colon carcinoma (P = 0.0001). NCAM levels were elevated in the sera of patients with SCLC (P = 0.0001). Normal levels of ICAM-1, E-selectin, and NCAM were found in both BPH and pretreatment CaP patients. Median NCAM levels in hormone-refractive CaP patients were significantly greater than in BPH (P = 0.0005) and CaP patients with pathologically determined organ-confined (P = 0.0014) or nonorgan-confined disease (P = 0.0385). VCAM-1 levels were significantly elevated in both BPH patients (P = 0.0002) and CaP patients (P = 0.0002) when compared with levels for normal age-matched donors. None of the CAMs were found to offer an advantage over prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) for monitoring CaP patients following definitive radiotherapy, radical prostatectomy, or hormonal therapy.;The results of this study indicate that serum ICAM-1, VCAM-1, NCAM, and E-selectin are not clinically useful biomarkers for differentiating CaP from BPH, for predicting progression, for identifying metastatic potential, or for monitoring treatment.",

Total melanoma gangliosides in micelles inhibited proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated by various mitogens, modulated lymphocyte surface molecules CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5 and CD8 and inhibited the production of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and IL-6 by stimulated adherent cells. Most of these effects were abrogated in the presence of serum. Purified serum lipoprotein fractions were tested for their ability to allow or inhibit the immunomodulatory effects of gangliosides. Melanoma gangliosides bound to very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) were shown to be as potent modulators of the immune response in vitro as when they were presented to cells in the form of micelles. Gangliosides bound to low-density lipoproteins were less active and gangliosides bound to high-density lipoproteins or the lipoprotein-free fraction had no immunomodulatory effects. Given the fact that gangliosides are predominantly bound to lipoproteins in serum, we conclude that lipoproteins are important determinants of the immunomodulating potential of tumor gangliosides, and that the immunomodulatory effects of melanoma gangliosides observed in vitro may also occur in vivo.",

A serum-free, chemically defined medium has been developed that allows continuous growth of established nevus cultures for up to several months. Like primary melanoma cells, nevus cells in high-calcium-containing W489 medium require insulin for growth. In contrast to melanoma cells, nevus cells in serum-free medium require the presence of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which enhanced intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. In contrast to the requirements of normal human melanocytes from newborn foreskin, congenital nevus cells grow with less dependency on basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Nevus cultures contain bFGF-like activity, and they express bFGF mRNA. Nevic cells of compound nevi also express bFGF mRNA in situ but only in the junctional areas. These results indicate that bFGF plays an important growth regulatory role for nevus cells in vitro and in vivo.",

To identify the pattern of tumor lymphatic drainage and the SLN, lymphoscintigraphy has been performed using primarily 99mTc-sulfur colloid (SC). In this study, we compare the efficacy of SLN biopsy using 99mTc-human serum albumin (HSA) with SLN biopsy after SC-based lymphoscintigraphy.;One hundred and six patients with localized cutaneous melanoma were studied. Lymphoscintigraphy was performed after intradermal injection of HSA in 85 patients and SC in 21 patients. Four patients underwent lymphoscintigraphy twice, once with SC and once with HSA. Dynamic images were acquired for up to 1 h, followed by high-count images of the SLN in various projections so that the most likely site was marked on the skin for biopsy. Intraoperatively, blue dye was injected around the primary site. Twenty-four patients underwent SLN dissection directed by preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and vital blue dye mapping; in the remaining 80 patients, a gamma probe was added intraoperatively to the localization procedure. Two patients underwent mapping with gamma probe alone.;Draining lymphatic basins and nodes were identified by lymphoscintigraphy in all patients. The SLN was identified in 95% of patients when both blue dye and intraoperative gamma probe were used. When 99mTc-HSA was used for imaging, 98% of the SLNs ultimately identified were radiolabeled, and 82% were both hot and blue. Of the SLN recovered with SC, all the nodes were radiolabeled; however, there was only 58% hot and blue concordance. Greater numbers of SLNs were removed in the SC group (median 2.0 versus 1.0, P = 0.02); however, the incidence of micrometastasis was statistically similar in both HSA and SC cohorts. In the 4 patients examined with both tracers, SLN mapping was similar.;Although SC has been the radiotracer of choice for SLN mapping in melanoma, HSA appears to be a suitable alternative, with identical success rates. In fact, the higher concordance between hot and blue nodes using HSA suggests superiority of this tracer for this purpose.",

The results were compared with those of 16 cirrhotic patients and 12 patients whose liver tissues were pathologically normal. MAGE-3 mRNA positive PCR products were DNA sequenced in 3 HCC patients. The sequenced fragments of MAGE-3 cDNA were used as template by which a [alpha(32)P] labeled probe was synthesized and employed for Southern blot analysis. HLA class I-A and -B typing of 43 HCC patients were assayed by ELISA.;Of the 45 HCC samples, 35 (78%) expressed MAGE-3 mRNA and six HCC adjacent tissues were also positive in MAGE-3 expression. Pathological examination showed cellular heteromorphism in these adjacent tissues. The non-HCC liver tissues from cirrhosis and normal liver samples were not MAGE-3 mRNA detectable. The DNA sequence confirmed that the target gene fragment in all of the 3 samples of PCR products was MAGE-3 cDNA. Southern blotting result confirmed that of RT-PCR assay.

Native u-PA purified from urine induced a mitogenic response in quiescent IF6 and M14 cells that ranged from 25 to 40% of the mitogenic response obtained by fetal calf serum. The half-maximum response in M14 and IF6 cells was reached at u-PA concentrations of approximately 35 and 60 nM, respectively. Blocking the proteolytic activity of u-PA resulted in a 30% decrease of the mitogenic effect, whereas inhibition of plasmin activity did not alter the mitogenic effect. No mitogenic response was elicited by low molecular weight u-PA, lacking the growth factor domain and the kringle domain. The ATF domain of u-PA induced a mitogenic response that was similar to complete u-PA. Defucosylated ATF and recombinant u-PA purified from Escherichia coli lacking all post-translational modifications did not induce a mitogenic response. Blocking the interaction of u-PA with u-PAR, using a specific monoclonal antibody, did not alter the mitogenic effect induced by u-PA. The binding of radiolabeled u-PA to M14 and IF6 cells was characterized by high affinity binding mediated by u-PAR and low affinity binding to an unknown binding site. These results demonstrate that proteolytically inactive u-PA is able to induce a mitogenic response in quiescent melanoma cells in vitro by a mechanism that involves the ATF domain but is independent of high affinity binding to u-PAR. Furthermore, it suggests that u-PA is able to bind with low affinity to a hitherto unidentified membrane associated protein that could be involved in u-PA-induced signal transduction.",

The profiles of serum antibody reactivity can be generated by using a high throughput sequencing of peptide-coding DNA from combinatorial random peptide phage display libraries selected for binding to serum antibodies. Here we demonstrate that the targets of immune response, which are recognized by serum antibodies directed against sequential epitopes, can be identified using the serum antibody repertoire profiles generated by high throughput sequencing. We developed an algorithm to filter the results of the protein database BLAST search for selected peptides to distinguish real antigens recognized by serum antibodies from irrelevant proteins retrieved randomly. When we used this algorithm to analyze serum antibodies from mice immunized with human protein, we were able to identify the protein used for immunizations among the top candidate antigens. When we analyzed human serum sample from the metastatic melanoma patient, the recombinant protein, corresponding to the top candidate from the list generated using the algorithm, was recognized by antibodies from metastatic melanoma serum on the western blot, thus confirming that the method can identify autoantigens recognized by serum antibodies. We demonstrated also that our unbiased method of looking at the repertoire of serum antibodies reveals quantitative information on the epitope composition of the targets of immune response. A method for deciphering information contained in the serum antibody repertoire profiles may help to identify autoantibodies that can be used for diagnosing and monitoring autoimmune diseases or malignancies.

The distribution of melphalan within tumour nodules and normal tissues was similar for both Krebs-Henseleit buffer and Hartmann's solution; however, tissue concentrations of melphalan were significantly higher for a perfusate containing 2.8% dextran 40 than for one containing 4.7% BSA. The melphalan concentration in the tumour was one-third of that found in the skin if the perfusate contained 4.7% BSA. In conclusion, this study has shown that a high perfusion flow enhances the delivery of melphalan into implanted tumour nodules and normal tissues, and a perfusate with low melphalan binding (no albumin) is preferred for maximum uptake of drug by the tumour.",

Three growth inhibiting polypeptides, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and oncostatin M, were isolated from the acid-soluble fraction of serum-free T cell-conditioned medium and purified by gel permeation chromatography and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography in volatile solvents at acid pH. The purification was monitored in a growth inhibition assay. The release of TGF-beta 1 biologic activity by and the purification of IFN-gamma from the medium of activated human peripheral blood T lymphocytes have been reported. We now describe the isolation of oncostatin M from the conditioned medium of activated human T cells. The concentration of oncostatin M required for half-maximal inhibition of A375 melanoma cells was approximately 4 pM when assayed in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. The purified oncostatin M had an apparent m.w. 28,000 and an amino-terminal sequence that was identical with the sequence of oncostatin M isolated from supernatants of macrophage-like cells. Suboptimal concentrations of TGF-beta 1 in combination with suboptimal concentrations of IFN-gamma or oncostatin M resulted in synergistic antiproliferative responses for A375 cells (1.9 and 3.1 times the expected additive responses, respectively). Combinations of oncostatin M and IFN-gamma added simultaneously to A375 cells caused an additive growth inhibitory response. These results demonstrate that oncostatin M is a novel lymphokine, and its interaction with other cytostatic polypeptide growth inhibitors may play a role in the immune regulation of tumor cell growth.",

The aim of this study was to establish markers for the prediction and early diagnosis of RP-ILD associated with JDM.;The clinical records of 54 patients with JDM were retrospectively reviewed: 10 had RP-ILD (7 died, 3 survived), 19 had chronic ILD and 24 were without ILD. Routine tests included a high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan of the chest and measurement of serum levels of creatine phosphokinase, ferritin and Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6). Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) antibodies and IL-18 levels were measured by ELISA.;No differences were found in the ratio of juvenile clinically amyopathic DM between the three groups. Initial chest HRCT scan findings were variable and could not distinguish between RP-ILD and chronic ILD. Anti-MDA5 antibodies were positive in all 8 patients with RP-ILD and 10 of 14 with chronic ILD, but none of the patients without ILD. Serum levels of anti-MDA5 antibody, ferritin, KL-6 and IL-18 were significantly higher in the RP-ILD group than in the chronic ILD and non-ILD groups. Serum levels of IL-18 positively correlated with serum KL-6 (R = 0.66, P < 0.001).;High serum levels of IL-18, KL-6, ferritin and anti-MDA5 antibodies (e.g. >200 units by ELISA) are associated with RP-ILD. These can be used as an indication for early intensive treatment. Both alveolar macrophages and autoimmunity to MDA5 are possibly involved in the development of RP-ILD associated with JDM.",

We have studied here possible tumor-derived molecular signals that could activate GSH release from hepatocytes. GSH efflux increases in hepatocytes isolated from mice bearing liver or lung metastases, thus suggesting a systemic mechanism. Fractionation of serum-free conditioned medium from cultured B16-F10 cells and monoclonal antibody-induced neutralization techniques facilitated identification of interleukin (IL)-6 as a tumor-derived molecule promoting GSH efflux in hepatocytes. IL-6 activates GSH release through a methionine-sensitive/organic anion transporter polypeptide 1- and multidrug resistance protein 1-independent channel located on the sinusoidal site of hepatocytes. Specific siRNAs were used to knock down key factors in the main signaling pathways activated by IL-6, which revealed a STAT3-dependent mechanism.

Genes expressed only in cancer tissue will be useful molecular markers for diagnosis and may also be good therapeutic targets. However, little is known about cancer-specific genes, at least in GC. In this study, we searched for GC-specific genes by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) data analysis and quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Comparing GC SAGE libraries with those of various normal tissues in the SAGEmap database, we identified 54 candidate GC-specific genes. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of these candidates revealed that APin protein (APIN), taxol resistance-associated gene 3 (TRAG3), cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily W, polypeptide 1 (CYP2W1), melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA), matrix metalloproteinase-10 (MMP-10), dickkopf homolog 4 (DKK4), GW112, regenerating islet-derived family, member 4 (REGIV), and HORMA domain-containing 1 (HORMAD1) were expressed much more highly in GC than in 14 kinds of normal tissues. Immunohistochemical staining for MIA, MMP-10, and DKK4 was found in 47 (31.1%), 68 (45.0%), and two (1.3%) of 151 GCs, respectively, and staining for both MIA and MMP-10 was correlated with poor prognosis in advanced GC (P=0.0001 and 0.0141, respectively). Moreover, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed high levels of MMP-10 (65/69, 94.2%) in serum samples from patients with GC. Levels of MIA were raised in a small proportion of serum samples from patients with GC (4/69, 5.8%). In Boyden chamber invasion assays, MIA-transfected GC cells were up to three times more invasive than cells transfected with empty vector. Taken together, these results suggest that MMP-10 is a good marker for the detection of GC and that MIA and MMP-10 are prognostic factors for GC. As expression of MIA and MMP-10 is narrowly restricted in cancer, these two molecules may be good therapeutic targets for GC.",

High-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy is known to induce the same cytokines in patients with advanced cancer. Therefore, we examined renal cell carcinoma (RCC; n = 5) and malignant melanoma (MM; n = 7) patients for evidence of cytokine-inducible NO synthesis. Activity of this pathway was evaluated by measuring serum and urine nitrate (the stable degradation product of NO) during IL-2 therapy. IL-2 administration caused a striking increase in NO generation as reflected by serum nitrate levels (10- and 8-fold increase [P less than 0.001, P less than 0.003] for RCC and MM patients, respectively) and 24-h urinary nitrate excretion (6.5- and 9-fold increase [both P less than 0.001] for RCC and MM patients, respectively). IL-2-induced renal dysfunction made only a minor contribution to increased serum nitrate levels. Metabolic tracer studies using L-[guanidino-15N2]arginine demonstrated that the increased nitrate production was derived from a terminal guanidino nitrogen atom of L-arginine.

One obstacle has been that some of the gangliosides that are overexpressed in human cancers are poorly immunogenic in humans. A case in point is GD3, a prominent ganglioside of human malignant melanoma. Using an approach that has been effective in the construction of bacterial carbohydrate vaccines, we have succeeded in increasing the immunogenicity of GD3 in the mouse by conjugating the ganglioside with immunogenic carriers. Several conjugation methods were used. The optimal procedure involved ozone cleavage of the double bond of GD3 in the ceramide backbone, introducing an aldehyde group, and coupling to aminolysyl groups of proteins by reductive amination. Conjugates were constructed with a synthetic multiple antigenic peptide expressing repeats of a malarial T-cell epitope, outer membrane proteins of Neisseria meningitidis, cationized bovine serum albumin, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and polylysine. Mice immunized with these conjugates showed a stronger antibody response to GD3 than mice immunized with unconjugated GD3. The strongest response was observed in mice immunized with the keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate of the GD3 aldehyde derivative and the adjuvant QS-21. These mice showed not only a long-lasting high-titer IgM response but also a consistent high-titer IgG response (predominantly IgG1), indicating recruitment of T-cell help, although the titers of IgM and IgG antibodies following booster immunizations were not as high as they are in the response to classical T-cell-dependent antigens. This method is applicable to other gangliosides, and it may be useful in the construction of immunogenic ganglioside vaccines for the immunotherapy of human cancers expressing gangliosides on their cell surface.",

However, tumor oxygenation is heterogeneous and cannot be sufficiently described by a single parameter. It is influenced by several factors including microvessel density (MVD), blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), blood oxygen saturation, tissue pO(2), oxygen consumption rate, and hypoxic fraction. The goal of this investigation was to integrate these measurements to obtain a comprehensive profile of tumor oxygenation. Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule immunohistochemistry, the recessed oxygen microelectrode, color and power Doppler ultrasound (DUS), and diffuse light spectroscopy (DLS) were used to measure tumor oxygen status using vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-transfected hypervascular human melanoma xenografts and their nontransfected counterparts as a model. NIH1286 human melanoma cells were transfected with a retroviral vector +/- a 720-bp fragment of human VEGF(121). High VEGF-producing clones were selected by ELISA. Oxygen consumption rate was measured in NIH1286/VEGF+ [VEGF-transfected cells (VEGF+ cells)] and NIH1286/Vec cells [cells transfected with vector alone (Vec cells)] using a standard Clark oxygen electrode. Athymic nude 6-8-week-old mice received s.c. injection in the right flank with 5 x 10(6) VEGF+ or Vec cells. When tumors were 10-14 mm in maximum dimension, serum was analyzed for VEGF by ELISA. Cryopreserved tumor tissue sections were immunostained for platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule, and MVD measurements were made. Tumor-bearing mice were anesthetized, and pO(2) measurements were made using Eppendorf pO(2) histograph or the recessed oxygen microelectrode. Tumor BF and BV were measured by quantitative analysis of DUS images. DLS was used to measure tumor BF and blood oxygen saturation variation. VEGF+ cell supernatants had 15,500 pg/ml VEGF, and Vec cells had 10 pg/ml. VEGF+ and Vec cells had equivalent oxygen consumption rates. VEGF+ tumors had a faster growth rate than Vec tumors. Serum from VEGF+ tumor-bearing mice showed 4,211 pg/ml VEGF, whereas VEGF was undetectable in the serum of control mice. MVD values were 74 +/- 11 in VEGF+ tumors and 39 +/- 4 in control tumors at x200 magnification/0.95-mm(2) area. The median pO(2) values were 3.5-fold higher in VEGF+ tumors than in Vec tumors by the recessed oxygen microelectrode and 18-fold higher by Eppendorf pO(2) histograph. DUS showed a 3.3-fold higher mean BF and a 5.5-fold higher BV in VEGF+ tumors than in Vec tumors. DLS showed a 3.2-fold higher mean BF and 1.7-fold higher oxygen saturation in the hypervascular tumors as compared with the control tumor type, consistent with increased BF and BV data by DUS.

        "Doc_abstract":"alpha 2-Macroglobulin (alpha 2-M) is known as a wide-spectrum proteinase inhibitor and to bind covalently certain growth factors. We have previously characterized tumor-associated alpha 2-M synthesized and secreted by human tumor cell lines. Of the cell lines studied, the melanoma cell line HMB-2 produced the largest amount of this glycoprotein. Immunofluorescence staining of cultured HMB-2 cells suggested that the cell population is heterogeneous with respect to alpha 2-M production. We have now isolated clones from the parental HMB-2 cells and characterized eight representative ones in detail. They varied considerably in the quantity of alpha 2-M secreted, from 4.2 to 46.5% of total protein. No relationship between the production of alpha 2-M by these clones and their pigmentation or tumorigenicity in nude mice was found. However, statistically there was a strong correlation between the modal chromosome number and population doubling time (r2 = 0.88, P less than 0.001) and also between the modal chromosome number and alpha 2-M production (r2 = 0.73, P less than 0.01). The growth rate of the clones correlated with the level of alpha 2-M in culture medium (r2 = 0.69, P less than 0.01). Clones with lower alpha 2-M production had a proportionally shorter population doubling time than the clones with intermediate or high production. Northern hybridization indicated quantitative variation in the alpha 2-M mRNA expressed by the parental cells and the clones, that was comparable but not identical with the quantity of alpha 2-M in the respective culture media; both parental cells and clones expressed platelet-derived growth factor A-chain mRNAs with little difference in levels. Serum-free medium from low alpha 2-M producer clones stimulated normal stationary fibroblasts significantly more than clones producing intermediate or high amounts of alpha 2-M. alpha 2-M decreased and anti-alpha 2-M IgG increased the stimulation. These results suggest that production of tumor-associated alpha 2-M is related to both autocrine and paracrine growth-stimulating activity of the tumor cells.",

We then used a library of random heptapeptides displayed at the surface of the filamentous M13 phage as fusion protein to the NH2-terminal portion of the minor coat protein III. After three rounds of selection on the bound mAb, several phages displaying related binding peptides were identified, yielding the consensus sequence Val-His-Leu-Asn-Tyr-Glu-His. Competitive ELISA experiments showed that this peptide can be specifically prevented from binding to mAb 763.74 by an anti-idiotypic MK2-23 mouse:human chimeric mAb and by A375 melanoma cells expressing the antigen MCSP. We screened the amino acid sequence of the MCSP molecule for a region of homology to the consensus sequence and found that the amino acid sequence Val-His-Ile-Asn-Ala-His spanning positions 289 and 294 has high homology. Synthetic linear peptides corresponding to the consensus sequence as well as to the MCSP-derived epitope inhibit the binding of mAb 763.74 to the phages displaying the consensus amino acid sequence. Finally, the biotinylated consensus peptide absorbed to streptavidin-microtiter plates can be used for the detection of mAb 763.74 in human serum.

Previously, we reported that GD3+ cells show stronger tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), p130(Cas), and paxillin when treated with fetal calf serum than GD3- cells. In this study, we analyzed the changes in the signals mediated by the interaction between integrins and extracellular matrices (ECM) to clarify how GD3 enhances cell signals in the vicinity of the cell membrane. An adhesion assay with a real time cell electronic sensing system revealed that GD3+ cells had stronger adhesion to all extracellular matrices examined. In particular, GD3+ cells attached more strongly to collagen type I and type IV than controls. Correspondingly, they showed stronger tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin during adhesion to collagen type I. In the floating pattern of detergent extracts, a high level of integrin beta1 was found in glycolipid-enriched microdomain (GEM)/rafts in GD3+ cells before adhesion, whereas a smaller amount of integrin beta1 was detected in the GEM/rafts of controls. Some phosphorylated forms of FAK as well as total FAK were found in GEM/rafts during cell adhesion only in GD3+ cells. Another signal consisting of integrin-linked kinase/Akt was also activated during adhesion more strongly in GD3+ cells than in controls. In double stained GD3+ cells, GD3 and integrin beta1 co-localized at the focal adhesion with a punctate pattern. All these results suggested that integrins assembled and formed a cluster in GEM/rafts, leading to the enhanced signaling and malignant properties under GD3 expression.",

High levels of soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) had been reported in melanoma and some epithelial tumors, especially in colorectal carcinoma. The concentrations of the sE-selectin were investigated in serum samples of 64 patients (32 men and 32 women) with colorectal cancer and 16 healthy subjects. Median age was 57 (range 20-75). Nineteen patients were staged as Dukes D, 9 of whom had liver metastasis. Serum levels of sE-selectin were determined by ELISA. In the study group, sE-selectin concentrations (mean+/-SE, ng/ml) were not significantly elevated, compared with the control group (41.09+/-4.57 in the control group and 43.80+/-1.88 in patients, p>0.05). Mean sE-selectin levels were 42.27+/-1.85 in non-metastatic and 47.42+/-4.57 in metastatic patients (p>0.05). Serum concentrations of sE-selectin were significantly elevated in patients with colorectal cancer metastatic to liver (59.07+/-7.52) in comparison to other patients without liver metastasis (p=0.013). There were no significant correlations between sE-selectin levels and other parameters such as age of patients, stage of disease, histopathological differentiation or localization of primary tumor. Elevated sE-selectin levels were confirmed as correlating with poor overall survival. In conclusion, sE-selectin concentrations may not be used as a predictive marker of metastasis in colorectal carcinoma, but high levels of sE-selectin may support diagnosis of liver metastasis.",

To further analyze the genetic control of GIF we have studied the growth-inhibitory activity of normal mouse serum from 8 different mouse strains and their F1 hybrids. A sensitive method using a chromogenic substrate for an endogenous lysosomal enzyme was used to measure the inhibitory activity of normal mouse serum on the mouse B16 melanoma. The highest level of GIF was found in old mice, lower activity in serum of young animals and no activity in suckling mice. To compare the genetic control of GIF and NK, spleen NK activity against B16 as well as YAC-1 targets was measured in parallel in the same animals. Confirming previous results we found the H-2k strains CBA and C3H to have high levels of GIF as well as NK activity, while the strain A/Sn and the A congenic strain A.SW had low levels of both activities. Experiments with H-2d and H-2b strains, however, showed that GIF and NK had a different genetic control; thus the DBA/2 and Balb/c strains had considerably higher GIF activity than the C57B1 and Leaden strains, while the reverse was true for NK activity. In F1 hybrid crosses between strains with high and low activity, high activity was inherited as a dominant trait for both GIF and NK. A backcross analysis in (A X CBA) X A backcross mice, segregating for NK and GIF showed that the two activities did not cosegregate. These studies therefore demonstrate that GIF and NK activity are under different genetic control, and do not support any direct or simple relationship between GIF and NK cells.",

The two most often used techniques to impart these qualities are lactam bridge construction and disulfide bond formation. While these techniques have been demonstrated to be effective, orthogonal protection/deprotection steps can limit achievable product yields. In the work described in this chapter, new α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) peptide analogs were synthesized and cyclized by copper-catalyzed terminal azide-alkyne cycloaddition \"click\" chemistry techniques. The α-MSH peptide and its cognate receptor (melanocortin receptor subtype 1, MC1R) represent a well-characterized model system to examine the effect of the triazole linkage for peptide cyclization on receptor binding in vitro and in vivo. Four new DOTA-conjugated α-MSH analogs were cyclized and evaluated by in vitro competitive binding assays, serum stability testing, and in vivo imaging by positron emission tomography (PET) of tumor-bearing mice. These new DOTA-conjugated click-cyclized analogs exhibited selective high binding affinity (<2 nM) for MC1R on melanoma cells in vitro, high stability in human serum, and produced high-contrast PET/CT images of tumor xenografts. (68)Ga-labeled DOTA bioconjugates displayed rapid pharmacokinetics with receptor-mediated tumor accumulation of up to 16 ± 5% ID/g. The results indicate that the triazole ring is an effective bioisosteric replacement for the standard lactam bridge assemblage for peptide cyclization. Radiolabeling results confirm that Cu catalyst is sufficiently removed prior to DOTA chelator addition to enable insertion of radio metals or stable metals for molecular imaging and therapy. Thus, these click-chemistry-cyclized variants show promise as agents for melanocortin receptor-targeted imaging and radionuclide therapy.",

DCs induced an immune response to control antigens in 16/18 patients. An enhanced immune response to 1 or more melanoma antigens (MelAgs) was seen in these 16 patients.

Six out of seven patients with immunity to two or fewer MelAgs had progressive disease 10 weeks after study entry, in contrast to tumour progression in only 1/10 patients with immunity to > two MelAgs. Since tumour immunotherapy targets autologous antigens we can learn from systemic autoimmunity such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). As opposed to normal monocytes, SLE monocytes induce proliferation of allogeneic CD4+ T cells. SLE sera induce monocyte differentiation towards DCs in an IFNalpha-dependent mechanism. Spiking autologous serum with IFNalpha reproduces DC differentiation. 50% of SLE patients have high serum levels of IFNalpha, which could explain T/B lymphopenia.

Relatively high levels of c-myc, c-fos and c-H-ras oncoproteins were also detected in 8- to 12-day-old embryos.

Murine myeloid leukemias and melanoma B 16 secrete a substance immunologically cross reactive with insulin (SICRI) both in vivo and in serum-free media. In culture, the DNA synthesis rate per leukemic or melanoma cell is proportional to cell density and is reduced by antiinsulin serum in case of leukemic cells. Human hemangiosarcoma secrete IGF I, which also plays a role as an autocrine factor. Purified IGF I efficiently induce c-myc and c-fos mRNA, which is among the earliest events following growth factor stimulation, leading to mitosis.

It contains an unusual E-pent-1-en-4-yne 5-carbon bridging unit with two distal catechol groups to which the glucose moieties are attached. It is non-toxic for BL6 mouse melanoma cells in tissue culture on condition that the fetal calf serum in the medium is heat-inactivated for 1 hour at 56 degrees C in order to destroy endogenous beta-glucosidase activity. The latter catalyses hypoxoside conversion to its cytotoxic aglucone, rooperol, which, when tested as a pure chemical, caused 50% inhibition of BL6 melanoma cell growth at 10 micrograms/ml. Light and electron microscopy revealed that the cytotoxic effect of rooperol manifested as vacuolisation of the cytoplasm and formation of pores in the plasma membrane. Indications of apoptosis were also found. Pharmacokinetic studies on mice dosed intragastrically with hypoxoside showed that it was deconjugated by bacterial beta-glucosidase to form rooperol in the colon. Surprisingly, no hypoxoside or rooperol was detectable in the serum. Only phase II biotransformation products (sulphates and glucuronides) were present in the portal blood and bile. In contrast, however, in human serum after oral ingestion of hypoxoside, the metabolites can reach relatively high concentrations. Rooperol metabolites isolated from human urine were non-toxic for BL6 melanoma cells in culture up to a concentration of 200 micrograms/ml. In the presence of beta-glucuronidase, which released rooperol from the metabolites, 50% growth inhibition was achieved at a 75 micrograms/ml metabolite concentration.

We show that IFN-alpha and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (p-I:C) synergize with the \"classical\" type-1-polarizing cytokine cocktail [tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)/IL-1beta/IFNgamma], allowing for serum-free generation of fully mature type-1-polarized DCs (DC1). Such \"alpha-type-1-polarized DC(s)\" (alphaDC1) show high migratory responses to the CCR7 ligand, 6C-kine but produce much higher levels of IL-12p70 as compared to TNFalpha/IL-1beta/IL-6/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-matured DCs (sDC), the current \"gold standard\" in DC-based cancer vaccination. A single round of in vitro sensitization with alphaDC1 (versus sDCs) induces up to 40-fold higher numbers of long-lived CTLs against melanoma-associated antigens: MART-1, gp100, and tyrosinase. Serum-free generation of alphaDC1 allows, for the first time, the clinical application of DCs that combine the key three features important for their efficacy as anticancer vaccines.",

The glycoprotein contained approximately 25% of serine and threonine plus equimolar amounts of glucosamine and galactosamine, indicating both N- and O-linked oligosaccharide chains. Neuraminidase treatment released approximately 60% of the glycoprotein's 3H radioactivity as N-acetylneuraminic acid.

Alkaline borohydride released 61% of the glycoprotein's radioactivity as oligosaccharide alcohols that were mainly tetrasaccharides (75%) with some branched trisaccharides (10%) from the O-linked structures. Hydrazinolysis and analysis of the alkaline borohydride-resistant portion of the glycoprotein indicated the presence of mainly triantennary, complex-type structures (N-linked) containing three sialic acids residues plus L-fucose. Serial lectin-affinity chromatography of the hydrazine-released saccharides with concanavalin A-agarose, pea lectin-agarose, L-PHA-agarose, and E-PHA-agarose, indicated the absence of high-mannose or hybrid-type structures and further confirmed the presence of triantennary, complex-type units.",

We recently reported that the induction of profound unresponsiveness in a T cell clone by melanoma cells expressing MHC class II antigens may provide a mechanism for these tumor cells to escape immunosurveillance. Here we demonstrate that two T cell clones (sTC3 and sTS5) produced high amounts of IL-10 after being rendered anergic by autologous melanoma cells. Co-culture of these T cell clones with melanoma cell transfectants expressing B7, which failed to induce anergy, resulted in a significantly lower production of IL-10. IL-10 production by the anergic T cell clones correlated with an impaired ability to produce IL-2 in response to TCR mediated activation. Neutralization of IL-10 reduced the duration of T cell unresponsiveness from 14 to only 4 days, but inhibition of IL-10 production during initiation of anergy showed no effect on it. Induction of the unresponsive state, as well as the subsequent IL-10 production in sTC3 cells, could be prevented by the addition of cyclosporin A to the primary co-culture of sTC3 and the autologous melanoma. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-10 is important for maintenance of T cell anergy induced by contact with nonprofessional antigen presenting cells such as MHC class II+ melanoma cells. Furthermore, we were able to detect IL-10 in serum from melanoma patients and IL-10 mRNA in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes isolated from melanoma metastases, suggesting an in vivo relevance of our in vitro findings.",

However, whether cells with self-renewal potential actually contribute to disease is unknown. Here we investigated the tumorigenic potential and fate of cancer cells in an in-vivo melanoma model. We examined cell lines which were derived from the same parental line: a non-metastatic cell line (K1735/16), a metastatic cell line (K1735/M4) and a cell line which was selected in non-adherent conditions (K1735/16S). All cell lines exhibited similar proliferation kinetics when grown on culture plates. K1735/16 cells grown in soft agar or in suspension non-adherent conditions failed to form colonies or spheroids, whereas the other cell lines showed prominent colonogenicity and spheroid formation capacity. By using sphere limiting dilution analysis (SLDA) in serum-free media, K1735/16S and K1735/M4 cells grown in suspension were capable of forming spheroids even in low frequencies of concentrations, as opposed to K1735/16 cells. The tumorigenic potential of the cell lines was determined in SCID mice using intra footpad injections. Palpable tumors were evident in all mice. In agreement with the in-vitro studies, the K1735/M4 cell line exhibited the highest growth kinetics, followed by the K1735/16S cell line, whereas the K1735/16 cell line had the lowest tumor growth potential (P<0.001). In contrast, when we repeated the experiments in syngeneic C3H/HeN mice, the K1735/16 cell line produced macroscopic tumors 30-100 days after injection, whereas K1735/M4 and K1735/16S derived tumors regressed spontaneously in 90-100% of mice. TUNEL analysis revealed significantly higher number of apoptotic cells in K1735/16S and K1735/M4 cell line-derived tumors compared to K1735/16 tumors (P<0.001).

These sera contained large amounts of IgG-BF as compared with controls. In the case of mice bearing IgG2a- or IgG2b-secreting hybridomas or lymphomas, serum IgG-BF increased progressively with tumour size and serum monoclonal IgG concentration, reaching 4-12 times the normal levels. A less than three-fold increase was found in mice bearing an IgG1-secreting hybridoma or tumours which do not secrete IgG (IgA-secreting hybridoma, non-immunoglobulin-secreting lymphoid tumours or melanoma) or in mice injected with 9 mg of monoclonal IgG2a. The enhancement of serum IgG-BF levels was independent of the expression of Fc gamma R by the tumour cells, suggesting that the majority of IgG-BF secreted in response to tumours was produced by the host rather than by the tumour.

One of the presumed pathophysiological mechanisms is an effect on tryptophan metabolism. As tryptophan is the precursor of serotonin, decreased availability of tryptophan to the central nervous system could result in serotonin deficiency. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH((4))) is a cofactor for one of the enzymes synthesizing serotonin. We conducted an exploratory study into the serum concentrations of large neutral amino acids (AA), biopterin (BIOP) and neopterin (NEOP), of 67 patients with high-risk melanoma, who were either treated with two different doses of IFN-alpha or were part of an observation-only control group. We found evidence for IFN-alpha to decrease concentrations of all AA except phenylalanine. The decrease in tryptophan concentration was most prominent and consistent. These changes persisted throughout a year of maintenance treatment. Concentrations of NEOP rose sharply, whereas, those of BIOP did not change. Except for the increase in NEOP and the increase in the ratio between phenylalanine (PHE) and tyrosine (TYR), no support for derangement in BH((4)) metabolism was found. The increase in the ratio between PHE and TYR suggests inhibition of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Patients with IFN-alpha induced anxiety and depression had higher pretreatment concentrations of NEOP. Changes in tryptophan metabolism may play a role in the pathophysiology of the neuropsychiatric side effects of IFN-alpha, and further research into the predictive potential of NEOP is warranted.",

In this study, we investigated whether GN8P also modulates tumor-specific B cell responses. Serum anti-B16F10 melanoma IgG levels, IgG2a mRNA expression, antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and counts of plasma as well as antigen presenting B cells were evaluated in tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice treated with GN8P and in respective controls. To reveal the mechanism of GN8P effects, the synthesis of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-4 (IL-4), cytokines involved in regulation of immunoglobulin class switch, was determined. The GN8P treatment significantly elevated IgG, and particularly IgG2a, response against B16F10 melanoma, which led to augmented ADCC reaction. The significant increase in production of IFN-γ, which is known to support IgG2a secretion, was observed solely in NK1.1 expressing cell populations, predominantly in NK cells. Moreover, GN8P raised the number of plasma cells, and promoted antigen presenting capacity of I-A/I-E-positive B lymphocytes by up-regulation of their CD80 and CD86 co-stimulatory molecule expression. These results indicate that GN8P-induced enhancement of tumor-specific antibody formation is triggered by NK cell activation, and contributes to complexity of anticancer immune response involving lectin-saccharide interaction.",

With subsequent therapy, serum levels of these cytokines, NK, T cells and eosinophils decreased, whereas serum IL-10 levels progressively increased with maximum levels achieved after the fifth week of treatment, suggesting that it may be involved in dampening the inflammatory response induced by IL-2.

Parental, low, and high GM-CSF-producing cells were injected subcutaneously into syngeneic and into nude mice.

These peptides were evaluated for their ability to block angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. A D-amino acid peptide with high serum stability (ST100,059) was found to have the most potent activity in vitro as indicated by inhibition of VEGF stimulation of endothelial cells. It was also found to be the most active of the series in blocking VEGF-mediated activity in vivo, as measured in Matrigel-filled angioreactors implanted in mice.

In in vivo studies, treatment of female C57BL/6 mice inoculated with B16 mouse melanoma cells with ST100,059 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in tumor volume and lung metastasis as compared to control groups of animals receiving vehicle alone. These studies demonstrate that by using MPD, peptides can be identified with enhanced affinity relative to those discovered using phage display.

In the present study, based on novel IgG antibody-measuring ELISA and antibody gene copy number-quantitative PCR, a human single B cell RT-PCR-mediated IgG monoclonal antibody (mAb) gene cloning method was established, and CMVpp65-specific human mAbs were successfully identified. Quantitative PCR for the human IgG mRNA copy number per cell demonstrated that the detection range was 10-250copies/cell.

Her medical history included the excision of a melanoma from the right ankle more than 20 years before. Ultrasound, CT and positron-emission tomography showed the mass in the right knee but no other lesions. The process was drained. Histological examination ofa subcutis biopsy indicated malignancy. Due to deterioration in her clinical condition amputation of the right leg was performed after which her leucocyte count normalized. The pathology specimen revealed a high-grade undifferentiated soft tissue tumour of unclear origin. Preoperatively assessed serum levels of granulocyte-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin 6 and interleukin 8 were elevated to 241, 91 and 82 pg/ml respectively. After the amputation these levels returned to almost normal. This extreme leucocyte count may be explained by a paraneoplastic leukemoid reaction. It is hypothesized that the tumour cells produce G-CSF and other cytokines causing leucocytosis. Normalisation of the cytokine levels postoperatively supports this hypothesis.",

One set of patients (designated \"type 1\"; n = 9) was characterized by low plasma IL-6 levels (48 to 1,700 pg/mL) as measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for IL-6. In the second set of patients (designated \"type 2\"; n = 6), IL-6 ELISAs showed high levels of plasma IL-6 (50 to 600 ng/mL). Neither group had detectable B9 hybridoma cell growth factor activity associated with the IL-6 in their pretreatment plasma or serum. Plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were markedly elevated in type II patients suggesting that the circulating IL-6 was biologically active in vivo. In both groups of patients there was a small but significant increase in B9 activity in the plasma within three hours after rIL-6 administration (n = 5). Gel filtration profiles showed that circulating IL-6 in type 1 patients, 15 to 120 minutes after rIL-6 administration was of approximate mass 20 to 40 kD, whereas in type 2 patients, the IL-6 before and after exogenous rIL-6 administration was indistinguishable and was of an approximate mass of 200 kD. IL-6 immunoaffinity purification of the 200 kD complexes showed these to contain multiple isoforms of IL-6 (14 to 31 kD) and the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R; 50 to 55 kD). A distinguishing clinical history was that all of the type 2 patients had been actively immunized with an anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody (MoAb) (MK2-23) 3 to 12 months before initiation of this study for advanced melanoma. An analysis of the plasma IL-6 content in other melanoma patients (n = 16) during antiidiotypic MoAb immunization indicated that marked (up to 600 ng/mL) and sustained (several months) elevations of circulating \"chaperoned\" IL-6 were induced by active immunization regimens.",

This dose was given as a bolus to 42 other rabbits either subconjunctivally (21 animals) or intravenously (21 animals). In both groups the dacarbazine concentrations in the ocular humours, serum and urine were measured by means of high-pressure liquid chromatography at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours, three animals being assessed at each interval. The peak serum levels of the drug were similar with the two routes of administration. The mean peak dacarbazine levels in the aqueous humour and vitreous humour after subconjunctival administration were 250 to 380 times those achieved after intravenous administration. The bioavailability of the drug over 24 hours was 107 micrograms/h.mL in the aqueous and 34 micrograms/h.mL in the vitreous after subconjunctival administration, compared with 0.65 and 0.14 micrograms/h.mL respectively after intravenous administration.

In this study, we investigated whether these processes can be promoted by s.c. administration of low-dose (0.5 microg/kg) recombinant human interleukin-12 (rHuIL-12) to metastatic melanoma patients. A striking burst of HLA-restricted CTL precursors (CTLp) directed to autologous tumor was documented in peripheral blood by a high-efficiency limiting dilution analysis technique within a few days after rHuIL-12 injection. A similar burst in peripheral CTLp frequency was observed even when looking at response to a single tumor-derived peptide, as documented by an increase in Melan-A/Mart-1(27-35)-specific CTLp in two HLA-A*0201+ patients by limiting dilution analysis and by staining peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) with HLA-A*0201-melanoma antigen-A/melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (Melan-A/Mart)-1 tetrameric complexes. The CTLp burst was associated, in PBLs, with enhanced expression of T-cell adhesion/homing receptors CD11a/CD18, CD49d, CD44, and with increased proportion of cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA)-positive T cells. This was matched by a marked increase, in serum, of soluble forms of the endothelial cell adhesion molecules E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecules (VCAM)-1 and intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM)-1. Infiltration of neoplastic tissue by CDS+ T cells with a memory and cytolytic phenotype was found by immunohistochemistry in eight of eight posttreatment metastatic lesions but not in five of five pretreatment metastatic lesions from three patients. Increased tumor necrosis and/or fibrosis were also found in several posttherapy lesions of two of three patients in comparison with pretherapy metastases. These results provide the first evidence that rHuIL-12 can boost the frequency of circulating antitumor CTLp in tumor patients, enhances expression of ligand receptor pairs contributing to the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1/ICAM-1, very late antigen-4/VCAM-1, and CLA/E-selectin adhesion pathways, and promotes infiltration of neoplastic lesions by CD8+ memory T cells in a clinical setting.",

In the present work, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity in the effective microvascular permeability constant, P(eff), of an 82 kDa macromolecule in an attempt to identify possible causes of the inadequate and heterogeneous uptake. Tumors of two human melanoma xenograft lines (A-07 and R-18) were included in the study. Human serum albumin with 30 gadopentetate dimeglumine units per molecule was used as a model molecule of macromolecular therapeutic agents. P(eff) was measured in manually defined regions of interest, corresponding to a whole tumor (ROI(WHOLE)) or to subregions of a tumor (ROIs(SUB)). The P(eff) of the ROI(WHOLE) of individual tumors ranged from 1.4 x 10(-7) cm/s to 2.8 x 10(-7) cm/s (A-07) and from 7.7 x 10(-8) cm/s to 3.2 x 10(-7) cm/s (R-18). P(eff) decreased with increasing tumor volume in R-18, but was independent of tumor volume in A-07. The intratumor heterogeneity in P(eff) exceeded the intertumor heterogeneity in both tumor lines. Some ROIs(SUB) showed P(eff) values that were similar to or slightly higher than the P(eff) values of albumin in normal tissues. Our observations suggest that inadequate and heterogeneous uptake of macromolecular therapeutic agents in tumor tissue is partly a result of low and heterogeneous microvascular permeability. However, the microvascular wall is probably not the major transport barrier to macromolecules in A-07 and R-18 tumors, as most individual tumors and individual tumor subregions showed high P(eff) values, i.e. values that are up to 10-fold higher than those of normal tissues.",

Because interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) was observed to cause hyperferritinaemia in three healthy people without increase of other APPs, we hypothesized that IFN-alpha stimulates specifically the synthesis of ferritin. To test this hypothesis, we studied ferritin and other APP levels in patients treated with IFN-alpha.;Fifteen patients treated with IFN-alpha-2b 3-5 times a week, as adjuvant treatment after excision of a high-risk melanoma, were compared with six patients without adjuvant treatment (controls). Serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) were measured using ELISA. Levels of ferritin, alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) and albumin were determined by nephelometry.;CRP was decreased significantly after 4 weeks (P < 0.01) in the patients treated with IFN-alpha compared with the nontreated patients, after 6 months of treatment it was still decreased although not significantly. Ferritin increased significantly in the IFN-alpha-treated patients: 187% of pretreatment value after 4 weeks and 217% after 6 months (P < 0.01), while ferritin levels decreased in the nontreated patients. AAG increased significantly in IFN-alpha-treated patients (107, 114%) compared with the control-patients (91, 76%) but differences were less compared with CRP and ferritin. sPLA2 had a variable course, while albumin remained constant within the normal range in both patient groups.;IFN-alpha induced a significant increase in ferritin, with a significant decrease in CRP, little increase in AAG, varying response of sPLA2 and no change in albumin. This finding suggests a specific role for IFN-alpha in the synthesis or secretion of ferritin. This mechanism may also be involved in the marked hyperferritinaemia in adult onset of Still's disease.",

In the standard serum-free transfection environment, MLP could effectively transfect glioblastoma, melanoma and hepatocarcinoma cells. A high transfection efficiency was maintained in the presence of serum. Apart from its high transfection efficiency, MLP was found to have negligible cytotoxicity over a wide range of concentrations and to exhibit a low membrane disruptive capacity ex vivo.

This protocol consistently resulted in an increase in the circulating IgG levels of all patients but had a variable effect on their IgA, IgM and IgE levels. Increases in the concentration of all 4 IgG subclasses contributed to the overall increase in IgG levels and these changes ranked IgG2 greater than IgG1 greater than IgG3 = IgG4. It also had an inconsistent effect upon the levels of alpha-macroglobulin in pregnancy but the levels of normal serum alpha2-macroglobulin were virtually unchanged. Pre-existing antibodies to C. parvum were noted in all the patients. Titres rose appreciably following C. parvum administration and remained at high, though fluctuating levels, throughout the 100-day period of observation.

C3471 cells suppress tumor formation only in immunocompetent hosts; mixtures of B559 and C3471 cells or C3471 cells alone form tumors in antithymocyte serum (ATS)-treated mice. Explants of C3471 tumors grown in ATS-treated mice form tumors in immunocompetent mice, most of which regress. Inability of C3471 or mixtures of C3471 with malignant cells to grow in normal mice, as contrasted with ability to grow in immunosuppressed mice, indicates that host response is involved. Both tumorigenic clones have high plasminogen activator activity, whereas nontumorigenic clone C3471 has none. Mixture of either tumorigenic clone with C3471 cells decreases plasminogen activator in vitro. C3471 tumor explants from ATS-treated mice initially express plasminogen activator, but lose the capacity to express this activity upon prolonged cultivation in vitro. Explants from B559 tumors retain plasminogen activator in long term culture. Close physical contact between C3471 and B559 cells appears essential both for inhibiton of plasminogen activator expression by B559 cells in vitro, and for tumor suppression in vivo.

In the course of studies designed to assess the ability of constitutive VEGF to block tumor regression in an inducible RAS melanoma model, mice implanted with VEGF-expressing tumors sustained high morbidity and mortality that were out of proportion to the tumor burden. Documented elevated serum levels of VEGF were associated with a lethal hepatic syndrome characterized by massive sinusoidal dilation and endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. Systemic levels of VEGF correlated with the severity of liver pathology and overall clinical compromise. A striking reversal of VEGF-induced liver pathology and prolonged survival were achieved by surgical excision of VEGF-secreting tumor or by systemic administration of a potent VEGF antagonist (VEGF-TRAP(R1R2)), thus defining a paraneoplastic syndrome caused by excessive VEGF activity. Moreover, this VEGF-induced syndrome resembles peliosis hepatis, a rare human condition that is encountered in the setting of advanced malignancies, high-dose androgen therapy, and Bartonella henselae infection. Thus, our findings in the mouse have suggested an etiologic role for VEGF in this disease and may lead to diagnostic and therapeutic options for this debilitating condition in humans.",

Candidate biomarkers should fulfil the key features of the OMERACT (Outcome Measures in Rheumatology) filter, that is, truth, discrimination, and feasibility. A number of biomarkers are currently being investigated in psoriatic disease for important clinical outcomes. Serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, interleukin 6 (IL-6), osteoprotegerin, matrix metalloprotease-3 (MMP-3), and the ratio of C-propeptide of type II collagen (CPII) to collagen fragment neoepitopes Col2-3/4 (long mono) (C2C) show promise as serum biomarkers that distinguish subjects with PsA from those with psoriasis alone. Serum MMP-3 and melanoma inhibitory activity, synovial fluid IL-1, IL-1 receptor-α, IL-6, IL-8, and chemokine CCL3 and synovial tissue CD3-positive T cells may prove useful as biomarkers of PsA activity. Circulating osteoclast precursors, Dickkopf-1, macrophage colony stimulating factor, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand, and bone alkaline phosphatase are strong candidates as biomarkers of radiographic change.

Many patients with similar histopathological features show significantly different clinical outcomes, and these differences are primarily related to metastases undetected by current diagnostic methods. There is no useful serological marker for metastatic disease. We investigated the cellular apoptosis susceptibility (CSE1L/CAS) protein in comparison with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a marker for metastatic colorectal cancer. Using serum from 103 patients with stage I, II, III, and IV disease, CSE1L was detected in 36.0% (9 of 25), 57.7% (15 of 26), 71.4% (30 of 42), and 88.9% (8 of 9) of patients, respectively; a pathological CEA level was found in 16.0% (4 of 25), 42.3% (11 of 26), 47.6% (20 of 42), and 77.8% (7 of 9) of patients, respectively; a combined CSE1L/CEA assay was detected in 48.0% (12 of 25), 65.4% (17 of 26), 88.1% (37 of 42), and 100% (9 of 9) of patients, respectively. Lymphatic metastasis is an important predictor of poor prognosis and crucial for determination of therapeutic strategy. Serum CSE1L was detected in 74.5% (38 of 51) of patients with lymph node metastasis, whereas a pathological CEA level was found in only 52.9% (27 of 51) of the same patients (P < 0.001); the combined CSE1L/CEA assay increased sensitivity to 90.2% (46 of 51). Animal experiments showed CSE1L reduction in B16-F10 melanoma cells correlated with decreased metastasis to the colorectal tract in C57BL/6 mice. These results indicate that assay of serum CSE1L may facilitate diagnosis of colorectal cancer lymphatic metastases; furthermore, CSE1L is a possible therapeutic target.",

Besides antigens known to elicit T-cell responses, such as MAGE-1 and tyrosinase, numerous additional antigens that were overexpressed or specifically expressed in tumors of the same type were identified. Sequence analyses suggest that many of these molecules, besides being the target of a specific immune response, might be of relevance for tumor growth. Antibodies to a given antigen were usually confined to patients with the same tumor type. The unexpected frequency of human tumor antigens, which can be readily defined at the molecular level by the serological analysis of autologous tumor cDNA expression cloning, indicates that human neoplasms elicit multiple specific immune responses in the autologous host and provides diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to human cancer.",

Nineteen children with solid tumors and eight children with hematologic malignancies were entered into the study. The maximum tolerated dose was 3 x 10(6) U/m2/day, with dose-limiting toxicities occurring in five of seven patients treated at the 5 x 10(6) U/m2/day dose level. Dose-limiting toxicities included hypotension, hyperbilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary/pleural effusion, and nephrotoxicity. Serum IL-2 levels were detectable at the higher dose levels and were comparable to those observed in adult patients. Hematologic changes at the higher dose levels included rebound lymphocytosis occurring within 48 h of discontinuation of IL-2, eosinophilia, and decreased platelet counts.

Ig is currently used to treat patients with diverse autoimmune conditions. Autoimmunity and malignancy co-exist frequently, and share etiological and pathological mechanisms. Since the two diseases are similarly treated, we studied the efficacy of i.v. Ig as a treatment for malignant conditions. The administration of i.v. Ig to mice inoculated i.v. with melanoma or sarcoma cells induced a statistically significant inhibition of metastatic lung foci and prolongation of survival time. Similar results were seen with SCID mice inoculated with SK-28 human melanoma cells. In a different model, melanoma was induced in the foot pad, followed by leg amputation, after the development of the tumor lesion. A lower number of melanoma recurrences and prolongation of survival time were demonstrated in the i.v. Ig-treated groups. In vitro studies revealed that i.v. Ig was found to stimulate the production of IL-12, an anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic cytokine. Moreover, it enhanced NK cell activity, thus explaining its beneficial effect in SCID mice (which lack B and T but possess NK cells). The results indicate that i.v. Ig acts as an anti-tumor agent.

Serum transferrin (Tf) contains two iron (Fe)-binding sites and plays a vital role in Fe transport. However, human MTf has only a single, high affinity, Fe-binding site. Furthermore, while isolated MTf can bind Fe, it plays little role in Fe uptake by cells and its function remains elusive. To further understand the biological role of this molecule, we examined the expression profile of mouse MTf (mMTf) and human MTf (hMTf) and the splice variant of the latter. Analysis of mMTf in 18 normal mouse tissues and 4 embryonic stages (7-17 days) using an RNA dot blot demonstrated it was expressed at high levels in the pancreas, salivary gland and epididymis of the adult, while embryonic tissues showed low expression. The expression pattern was very different from that of mouse transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) mRNA, which was found at high levels in the spleen and embryo. Using the more sensitive RT-PCR technique, mMTf expression was demonstrated across all 24 normal mouse tissues assessed. Analysis of the mMTf genomic sequence predicted only one mMTf transcript, although two putative transcripts were found in the testis using Northern blotting. An alternate hMTf transcript, h delta MTf, has been identified by others, although its tissue distribution was not previously examined. In human heart and skeletal muscle, three putative hMTf transcripts were identified at approximately 2, 3 and 4 kb, the smallest transcript being consistent with h delta MTf. The two larger transcripts were also found in 10 other human tissues. The h delta MTf transcript was detected using RT-PCR and Southern blotting in tumour-derived cell lines, with the highest expression being identified in melanoma cells. Immunohistochemistry showed that hMTf was expressed primarily within epithelia. In fact, the most pronounced expression was within the epidermis of the skin, tubules of the kidney and the ducts of sweat and salivary glands. The distribution of MTf and its splice variants may provide clues to their possible biological roles.",

Here, we investigated the effect of triptolide on regulatory T cells and on the level of IL-10, transforming growth factor-β, and vascular endothelial growth factor in tumor-bearing mice. Fifty male C57BL/6 mice were randomly grouped as follows: normal control group, model group with B16-F10 cells implanted, and three treatment groups with cyclophosphamide, triptolide-high dose, triptolide-low dose. The proportion of regulatory T cells in the spleen and axillary lymph nodes was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis. Production of cytokines IL-10, transforming growth factor-β, and vascular endothelial growth factor in serum was measured using enzyme-labeled immunosorbent assay kits. The mRNA levels of Foxp3, IL-10, and transforming growth factor-β in the spleen and vascular endothelial growth factor in tumor tissue were detected by real-time PCR. The results showed that triptolide significantly decreased the proportion of regulatory T cells and lowered the Foxp3 level in the spleen and axillary lymph nodes of tumor-bearing mice. Production of IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β in peripheral blood, and the mRNA level of IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β in the spleen were also decreased. Additionally, triptolide could remarkably inhibit production of vascular endothelial growth factor in tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that triptolide might inhibit tumor growth by inhibiting regulatory T cells and some cytokines such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β, as well as production of vascular endothelial growth factor.

In B16 melanoma and P815 mastocytoma models, antitumor efficacy of IL-12 protein therapy appeared to be slightly higher than that of IL-12 gene therapy; however, the protein therapy protocol in this comparative study resulted in a high level of mortality of mice. It was also demonstrated that IL-12 gene therapy, in contrast to the IL-12 protein therapy, was not associated with weight loss, splenomegaly, increased Ly6 antigen expression in the spleen, or visible signs of toxicity, such as fur ruffling and lethargy. Moreover, serum levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induced in response to IL-12 gene therapy were 300-1000 times lower than those induced by the systemic IL-12 protein administration. Together, these results suggest that gene gunmediated in vivo delivery of IL-12 cDNA may be considered as a safer alternative to IL-12 protein therapy for certain human cancers.",

Here it functions as a pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic signaling receptor via NH(2)-terminal domain ligation. Auto-antibodies to this domain may appear in cancer patient serum where they are a poor prognostic indicator. Conversely, GRP78 COOH-terminal domain ligation is pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative. There is no method to disrupt cell-surface GRP78 without compromising the total GRP78 pool, making it difficult to study cell-surface GRP78 function. We studied six cell lines representing three cancer types. One cell line per group expresses high levels of cell-surface GRP78, and the other expresses low levels (human hepatoma: Hep3B and HepG2; human prostate cancer: PC3 and 1-LN; murine melanoma: B16F0 and B16F1). We investigated the effect of Escherichia coli subtilase cytoxin catalytic subunit (SubA) on GRP78. We report that SubA specifically cleaves cell-surface GRP78 on HepG2, 1-LN, and B16F1 cells without affecting intracellular GRP78. B16F0 cells (GRP78(low)) have lower amounts of cleaved cell-surface GRP78. SubA has no effect on Hep3B and PC3 cells. The predicted 28-kDa GRP78 COOH-terminal fragment is released into the culture medium by SubA treatment, and COOH-terminal domain signal transduction is abrogated, whereas pro-proliferative signaling mediated through NH(2)-terminal domain ligation is unaffected. These experiments clarify cell-surface GRP78 topology and demonstrate that the COOH-terminal domain is necessary for pro-apoptotic signal transduction occurring upon COOH-terminal antibody ligation. SubA is a powerful tool to specifically probe the functions of cell-surface GRP78.",

To discover disrupters of aberrant STAT3 signaling pathways as novel anticancer drugs, we developed a phosphotyrosine STAT3 cytoblot. Using this high throughput 96-well plate assay, we identified JSI-124 (cucurbitacin I) from the National Cancer Institute Diversity Set. JSI-124 suppressed the levels of phosphotyrosine STAT3 in v-Src-transformed NIH 3T3 cells and human cancer cells potently (IC(50) value of 500 nM in the human lung adenocarcinoma A549) and rapidly (complete inhibition within 1-2 h). The suppression of phosphotyrosine STAT3 levels resulted in the inhibition of STAT3 DNA binding and STAT3-mediated but not serum response element-mediated gene transcription. JSI-124 also decreased the levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated Janus kinase (JAK) but not those of Src. JSI-124 was highly selective for JAK/STAT3 and did not inhibit other oncogenic and tumor survival pathways such as those mediated by Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, or c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase. Finally, JSI-124 (1 mg/kg/day) potently inhibited the growth in nude mice of A549 tumors, v-Src-transformed NIH 3T3 tumors, and the human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-468, all of which express high levels of constitutively activated STAT3, but it did not affect the growth of oncogenic Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 tumors that are STAT3 independent or of the human lung adenocarcinoma Calu-1, which has barely detectable levels of phosphotyrosine STAT3. JSI-124 also inhibited tumor growth and significantly increased survival of immunologically competent mice bearing murine melanoma with constitutively activated STAT3.

Our previous studies demonstrated that recombinant human plasminogen kringle 1-5 (K1-5) has superior antitumor activity compared with angiostatin. In addition, optimization of recombinant K1-5 with three amino acid substitutions enhances its antitumor effect. The current study was thus undertaken to evaluate prolonged expression of optimized K1-5 as cancer gene therapy. The recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector was used to express a secreted form of the optimized K1-5 (AAV-sK15tm) to improve its pharmacokinetic profile, which was considered to be the hurdle in angiostatin treatment of cancer. We successfully generated high-titer recombinant AAV vectors and observed sustained transgene expression for 567 days after a single injection of virus. The treated animals did not display any visible signs of abnormalities and showed normal serum biochemistry. The therapeutic potential of this treatment modality was demonstrated by both a strong inhibition of lung metastasis in the mouse B16F10 melanoma model and significant growth retardation of Lewis lung carcinoma xenografts in C57BL/6N mice as well as human A2058 melanoma xenografts in NOD/SCID (nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient) mice.

Rat hindlimbs were perfused with Krebs-Hen-seleit buffer containing 4.7% bovine serum albumin at 37 or 41.5 degrees C at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Concentrations of melphalan in perfusate and tissues were determined by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The concentration of melphalan in perfusate and tissues was linearly related to the input concentration. The rate and amount of melphalan uptake into the different tissues was higher at 41.5 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. A physiological pharmacokinetic model was validated from the tissue and perfusate time course of melphalan after melphalan perfusion. Application of the model involved the amount of melphalan exposure in the muscle, skin and fat in a recirculation system was related to the method of melphalan administration: single bolus > divided bolus > infusion. The peak concentration of melphalan in the perfusate was also related to the method of administration in the same order. Infusing the total dose of melphalan over 20 min during a 60 min perfusion optimized the exposure of tissues to melphalan whilst minimizing the peak perfusate concentration of melphalan.

Here, we investigated whether sTNF-R shedding in response to HT occurs during HILP.;The serum levels of sTNFR-1 were measured in 23 patients with HILP by obtaining serum from the extracorporeal and central circuits. The samples were taken from the patients under normothermic (37°C) and hyperthermic (39°C) conditions. Additionally, cell cultures of HUVEC, human fibrosarcoma cells and peripheral blood cells were used to confirm the effects of HT on sTNF-R1 shedding by ELISA and western blot.;Under HT, levels of sTNF-R1 increased 23.5% in the extracorporeal circuit, but this increase was not observed in the systemic circuit. However, we could not confirm this effect using the cell culture model, where cellular TNF-R1 and sTNF-R1 of culture supernatants, respectively, were not significantly different between NT and HT conditions.;HT is associated with an increase of sTNF-R1 in the extracorporeal circuit of perfused limbs.

This included two 5 min sessions of direct social interaction with their resident cagemates (which had been selected for consistent levels of aggression). The subjects' behavior was videotaped and assessed. Corticosterone, IL-2, IL-12 and splenic cell proliferation responses to Con-A were determined 1h and 3 days post-stress. Lung metastatic foci numbers were determined 21 days after inoculation (15 days post-stress). Social stress increased the number of pulmonary metastases and the serum level of corticosterone but decreased the splenic proliferative capacity. No direct relationship could be established between the development of the metastases and the assayed interleukin response. A combination of cluster and discriminant analyses established that there were three types of coping strategies.

Although cancer is increasingly controlled as a chronic disease, true cures of patients with metastatic epithelial malignancies have rarely been obtained with currently available systemic therapies. For example, administration of high-dose recombinant interleukin 2 (IL2), enhancing cytolytic immune cell proliferation and delivery, promotes complete antitumor responses in < 10% of treated individuals. Means to reduce the toxicity, attributed to a cytokine storm and an associated \"systemic autophagic syndrome\" as well as enhance efficacy and increase the potential set of malignancies in which it is applied (currently patients with renal cancer and melanoma) would be of great interest. IL2 promotes both T-cell and NK cell induction of immune cell-mediated autophagy (iC-MA) in tumor targets. We have demonstrated that HMGB1 is detected at high levels in the serum of IL2-treated mice with translocation to the cytoplasm from the nucleus in the liver, consistent with HMGB1's release in response to stress, and ability to sustain autophagy. Limiting autophagy in mice with coadministration of chloroquine (CQ) diminishes serum levels of HMGB1, cytokines (IFNG and IL6 but not IL18), and autophagic flux, attenuating weight gain, enhancing DC, T-cell and NK cell numbers, and promoting long-term tumor control in a murine hepatic metastases model. Autophagy (programmed cell survival) is a metabolic process associated with promotion of late cancer growth. In tumor cell lines, CQ treatment limits ATP production through inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and promotion of apoptosis. CQ increases autophagic vacuoles and LC3-II levels in tumor cells, associated with increased annexin V(+)/PI(-) cells, cleaved-PARP, cleaved-CASP3, and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. These observations, limiting toxicity and prolonging antitumor effects, with a combination of IL2 and autophagy inhibition in murine models are now being tested by the Cytokine Working Group in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.",

ReCCMSH has been derivatized with a 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) chelate so that it can be labeled with a wide variety of radionuclides for imaging and therapeutic applications. This study involved optimization of the in vivo biological properties of DOTA-ReCCMSH (S), through modification of the structure of the metallopeptide. Several DOTA-ReCCMSH analogues, Ac-Lys(DOTA)-ReCCMSH (4) DOTA-ReCCMSH(Arg(11)) (6), DOTA-ReCCMSH-OH (8), and DOTA-ReCCMSH-Asp-OH (10), were synthesized using solid phase peptide synthesis followed by rhenium cyclization. The IC(50) values of the metallopeptides were determined through competitive binding assays against (125)I-(Tyr(2))-NDP. Radiolabeling of the DOTA-rhenium-cyclized peptides with (111)In was carried out in NH(4)OAc (0.1 M; pH 5.5)-buffered solution for 30 min at 70 degrees C. The stability of the radiolabeled complexes was evaluated in 0.01 M, pH 7.4, phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% bovine serum albumin solution. After separation of the radiolabeled peptide from the unlabeled peptide by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography, the biodistribution of the radiolabeled complex was performed in C57 mice bearing B16/F1 murine melanoma tumors. All radiolabeled complexes showed fast blood clearance (2 h postinjection (pi): (111)In-S, 0.07 +/- 0.03% ID/g; (111)In-4, 0.09 +/- 0.06% ID/g; (111)In-6, 0.21 +/- 0.08% ID/g; (111)In-8, 0.11 +/- 0.10% ID/g; and (111)In-10, 0.05 +/- 0.03% ID/g), and their clearance was predominantly through the urine (4 h pi: 93.5 +/- 1.7, 87.8 +/- 6.5, 89.8 +/- 4.2, 93.3 +/- 1.1, and 93.8 +/- 1.8 (% ID) for (111)In-labeled S, 4, 6, 8, and 10, respectively).

In this study, PKC activity, immunoreactive protein, and phorbol ester-binding kinetics were examined in primary cultures of normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) in order to elucidate the relationship between PKC and NHEK proliferation and differentiation. NHEK were maintained in a proliferative phase in serum-free low-calcium (0.15 mM) medium, and then were exposed to high calcium (1.6 mM) in order to stimulate growth arrest and differentiation. Staurosporine was inhibitory to Ca(++)-induced differentiation. Scatchard analysis of phorbol binding indicated that exposure to high calcium for 24 h increased the number of binding sites (Bmax) by fivefold. In correlation with the ligand-binding results, PKC activity was extremely low in proliferating (low-calcium) NHEK compared to differentiating cells (high calcium). When assayed after 24, 48, and 72 h, high calcium induced tenfold or greater increases in Ca++/phospholipid-dependent phosphotransferase activity. Immunoblot analysis of NHEK PKC using antibodies directed against the hinge region of PKC alpha/beta also indicated that exposure to high calcium resulted in higher levels of immunoreactive protein. Therefore, PKC in NHEK appears to be upregulated under conditions of Ca(++)-induced growth arrest and differentiation. In addition, NHEK and other human skin cell particulate fractions contain a protein of approximately 116 kDa that is highly immunoreactive to an antibody to PKC alpha/beta, which coelutes from DEAE-sephacel under the same buffer conditions as the 80-kDa PKC.",

Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine whether prolonged incubation of cells in FBS, for more than standard 5 min, can lead to increased transfection efficiency and improved cell survival. Different murine melanoma and murine and human endothelial cell lines were transfected with plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein and then incubated for different periods of time in FBS (5-30 min). Transfection efficiency was determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy and cell survival by cell viability assay. Prolonged incubation of cells in FBS after gene electrotransfer had varying effect on cell survival, which was decreased in melanoma cell lines B16F1 and B16F10, minimally affected in SVEC4-10 and HUVEC cells and increased in 2H11 cell at 30 min of incubation time in FBS. On the other hand, transfection efficiency of gene electrotransfer was not affected by long incubation of cell in FBS, regardless of the cell line used.

These cells mediate very efficient antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against human melanoma and neuroblastoma cell lines in the presence of two murine IgG3 mAbs (3F8 and R24). They also mediate antibody-independent cytotoxicity (or cytostasis) to a lesser extent. Human serum had an inconsistent effect on ADCC, but often induced similar high levels of ADCC. Cytotoxicity was measured using a novel ELISA to detect surviving tumor cells after ADCC. Two conventional isotope-release assays (51Cr and [3H]TdR) underestimated or entirely failed to detect ADCC by M-CSF-activated monocytes. Optimal activation occurred with 100-300 U/ml of M-CSF, and required 9-11 d for completion. Most of the M-CSF cultured monocytes expressed the low-affinity Fc receptor (CD16).

In MGM, none of these interferons inhibited the growth of normal melanocytes at concentrations 1-10,000 international units (IU)/ml over a period of 5 d. Only nIFN-beta, dose dependently, inhibited melanocyte proliferation in CMM and RMM in a 6- and 12-d assay (growth inhibition at 10,000 IU/ml; 77-80% of the controls, p less than 0.001). In contrast, rIFN-alpha and rIFN-gamma exerted no (RMM), or minor effects (CMM) on melanocyte proliferation (only in 12-d assays at 10,000 IU/ml: 24% and 21% of the controls respectively, p less than 0.01). In parallel experiments performed on melanoma cells, all three interferons were potent inhibitors of proliferation in a 5-d serum-free assay (growth inhibition at 10,000 IU/ml; rIFN-alpha 59%, nIFN-beta 78%, rIFN-gamma 56%, all p less than 0.001). In addition, nIFN-beta and also rIFN-gamma caused striking morphologic changes of normal melanocytes in vitro. Especially under greater than or equal to 10 IU/ml rIFN-gamma cytoplasmic spreading and flattening of the cultured melanocytes and their nuclei were seen, thus resembling melanoma cells in vitro. Untreated human melanocytes grown in MGM showed high expression of the melanoma-associated antigens HMB-45 (95-100%) and K.1.2 (40-100%), whereas the progression marker A.1.43 was present only on less than 5% of the cells.

The IgG induced strong lysis of all seven target cell types. However, lysis of the five urothelial lines was significantly stronger than that of the control tumors. Conversely, antisera to either of the control tumors induced a significantly stronger lysis of the homologous tumors than of the urothelial cells. All antisera contained antibodies to fetal bovine serum but removal of these by absorption did not change the specificity of the ADCC reactions. When the anti T-24 serum was exhaustively absorbed with glutaraldehyde-fixed spleen homogenate, the cytotoxicity to the control tumor targets was abolished. Although absorption reduced the antibody titer of the IgG preparation, ADCC to the TCC targets remained at a high level. There was no difference in the degree of lysis of the three TCC targets. Lysis of the two target lines from normal urothelium was slightly lower than that of the tumor cells. The results indicate that the anti-TCC serum contained antibodies to one or several antigens shared by five urothelial cell lines but not by the control tumors.

To explore the possibility that interactions between tumor cells and host fibroblasts stimulate hyaluronate synthesis, human tumor cells were grown separately from and in coculture with normal human fibroblasts. Stimulation was observed with each of the three types of tumor cells used: LX-1 lung carcinoma, DAN pancreatic carcinoma, and TRIG melanoma. The interaction between LX-1 cells and fibroblasts was studied in detail. Under serum-free conditions, cocultures of LX-1 and fibroblasts synthesized 3-fold more hyaluronate than the sum of that produced by LX-1 and fibroblast cultures grown separately. This stimulation was linear over 72 hr and hyaluronate represented 80% of the glycosaminoglycan synthesized. Maximum stimulation occurred at a ratio of fibroblasts to LX-1 cells of 1-2:1. Quantitation of unlabeled glycosaminoglycans by HPLC analysis of disaccharides generated by digestion with chondroitin ABC and AC lyases (EC 4.2.2.4 and 4.2.2.5) demonstrated that net accumulation of hyaluronate increased 2-fold and that hyaluronate represented 80% of total chondroitinase-sensitive glycosaminoglycan produced by the cocultures. The disaccharide patterns obtained showed that accumulations of chondroitin-4- and chondroitin-6-sulfates were stimulated proportionately to that of hyaluronate in these cocultures. Similar levels of stimulation due to coculture were obtained in serum-containing and serum-free media. Stimulation was not effected by addition of LX-1-conditioned medium to fibroblast cultures or by culturing LX-1 and fibroblasts under conditions where they shared the same medium but were physically separated.

ADCC relies on the interaction of the antibody's Fc portion with Fc-gama receptors (FcgammaR) on immune effector cells. The anti-tumor activity of human IgG1 antibodies is frequently assessed in mouse models. Binding of human IgG1 to murine FcgammaRs is however of reduced affinity. We here show that ADCC of adecatumumab (MT201), a fully human IgG1 antibody specific for epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM/CD326), is drastically lower if human peripheral blood mononuclear cells are replaced by murine splenocytes as effector cells. When the variable domains of adecatumumab were genetically fused to a murine IgG2a backbone (yielding mu-adecatumumab), ADCC with murine effector cells was much improved, but at the same time significantly reduced with human effector cells. The serum half-lives of adecatumumab and mu-adecatumumab were determined in mice and dosing schedules established that gave similar serum trough levels during a 4-week antibody treatment. The anti-tumor activities of adecatumumab and mu-adecatumumab were then compared side-by-side in a lung metastasis mouse model established with a syngeneic B16 melanoma line expressing human EpCAM at physiologically relevant levels. Treatment of mice with mu-adecatumumab led to an almost complete prevention of lung metastases, while the human version of the antibody was much less active. This shows that adecatumumab has high anti-tumor activity when tested in a form that is better compatible with the species' immune system. Moreover, our data suggest to routinely compare in mouse models human IgG1 and murine IgG2a versions of antibodies to properly assess the contribution of ADCC to overall anti-tumor activity.",

The heparin-conjugated liposomes (heparin-liposomes) were prepared by fixation of the negatively charged heparin to the positively charged liposomes. The existence of heparin on the liposomal surface was confirmed by measuring the changes in the particle size, zeta potential and heparin amount of the liposomes. The stability of the heparin-liposomes in serum was higher than that of the control liposomes, due to the heparin-liposomes being better protected from the adsorption of serum proteins. The DOX-loaded heparin-liposomes showed high drug levels for up to 64 h after the intravenous injection and the half-life of DOX was approximately 8.4- or 1.5-fold higher than that of the control liposomes or polyethyleneglycol-fixed liposomes (PEG-liposomes), respectively. The heparin-liposomes accumulated to a greater extent in the tumor than the control or PEG-liposomes as a result of their lower uptake by the reticuloendothelial system cells in the liver and spleen. In addition, the DOX-loaded heparin-liposomes retarded the growth of the tumor effectively compared with the control or PEG-liposomes. These results indicate the promising potential of heparin-liposomes as a new sterically stabilized liposomal delivery system for the enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents.",

In this study, we labeled a novel GLP-1 analogue, EM3106B, with (18)F and performed PET imaging to visualize insulinoma tumors in an animal model. A GLP-1 analogue that contains multiple lactam bridges, EM3106B, was labeled with (18)F through a maleimide-based prosthetic group, N-2-(4-(18)F-fluorobenzamido)ethylmaleimide ((18)F-FBEM). The newly developed radiotracer was characterized by cell based receptor-binding assay, cell uptake and efflux assay. The stability in serum was evaluated by radio-HPLC analysis. In vivo PET imaging was performed in nude mice bearing subcutaneous INS-1 insulinoma tumors and MDA-MB-435 tumors of melanoma origin. Ex vivo biodistribution study was performed to confirm the PET imaging data. EM3106B showed high binding affinity (IC(50) = 1.38 nM) and high cell uptake (5.25 ± 0.61% after 120 min incubation). (18)F-FBEM conjugation of EM3106B resulted in high labeling yield (24.9 ± 2.4%) and high specific activity (>75 GBq/μmol at the end of bombardment). EM3106B specifically bound and was internalized by GLP-1R positive INS-1 cells. After intravenous injection of 3.7 MBq (100 μCi) of (18)F-FBEM-EM3106B, the INS-1 tumors were clearly visible with high contrast in relation to the contralateral background on PET images, and tumor uptake of (18)F-FBEM-EM3106B was determined to be 28.5 ± 4.7 and 25.4 ± 4.1% ID/g at 60 and 120 min, respectively. (18)F-FBEM-EM3106B showed low uptake in MB-MDA-435 tumors with low level of GLP-1R expression. Direct tissue sampling biodistribution experiment confirmed high tracer uptake in INS-1 tumors and receptor specificity in both INS-1 tumor and pancreas. In conclusion, (18)F-FBEM-EM3106B exhibited GLP-1R-receptor-specific targeting properties in insulinomas. The favorable characteristics of (18)F-FBEM-EM3106B, such as high specific activity and high tumor uptake, and high tumor to nontarget uptake, demonstrate that it is a promising tracer for clinical insulinoma imaging.",

However, there is a strong preclinical rationale that supports this autoimmune toxicity. We describe for the first time the case of an adult patient who developed autoimmune diabetes likely as a consequence of PD-1 inhibition with pembrolizumab. The presence of high serum titres of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies together with a suggestive clinical presentation, age of the patient and preclinical data strongly support an autoimmune aetiology of the diabetes. Moreover, the patient was found to have a well-known high-risk human leucocyte antigen type for the development of type 1 diabetes in children, so the PD-1 inhibition is very likely to have triggered the autoimmune phenomenon.

A failure in the development of Valpha14iNKT cells occurs in the LckCrePten thymus between stage 2 (CD44(high)NK1.1(-)) and stage 3 (CD44(high)NK1.1(+)), resulting in decreased numbers of peripheral Valpha14iNKT cells.

Following interaction with dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with alphaGalCer, Pten-deficient Valpha14iNKT cells demonstrate activation of PI3K. Indeed, the effects of the Pten mutation require intact function of the PI3K subunits p110gamma and p110delta. In vivo, LckCrePten mice display reduced serum IFNgamma after alphaGalCer administration. Importantly, Valpha14iNKT cell-mediated protection against the metastasis of melanoma cells to the lung was impaired in the absence of Pten.

Pericytes have close contact with endothelial cells and are probably involved in the regulation of endothelial cell functions. Previous studies suggested a role for pericytes in microvascular proliferation in tumors. To study this cell type, we isolated human brain pericytes from microvessel segments derived from autopsy brain tissue. These cells were characterized in vitro using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Human brain pericytes were reactive with monoclonal antibodies directed against the high molecular weight-melanoma associated antigen and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, but only a minority of the cells expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA, 0 to 10%) or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (10 to 50%). In histologically normal human brain microvessels in situ, pericytes consistently lacked staining for these four markers. Tissue with microvascular proliferation, however, showed a marked pericyte staining for both alpha-SMA and high molecular weight-melanoma associated antigen. The expression of alpha-SMA in vitro could be slightly up-regulated by incubation with serum-containing medium. An increase in alpha-SMA expression up to 40% of the total cell population was seen when pericytes were treated with transforming growth factor-beta 1, whereas basic fibroblast growth factor slightly inhibited alpha-SMA expression. Incubation with other factors (platelet-derived growth factor-AA, heparin, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) had no effect on the alpha-SMA expression at all. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 thus induces smooth muscle-like differentiation in pericytes in vitro and might play a role in the activation of pericytes during angiogenesis in vivo.",

We examined death in cultured periodontal fibroblasts, connective tissue cells that are exposed to heavy applied forces in vivo. Static tensile forces (0.48 piconewtons/microm2 cell area) were applied through magnetite beads coated with collagen or bovine serum albumin. There was a time-dependent increase of the percentage of propidium iodide-permeable cells in force-loaded cultures incubated with collagen but not bovine serum albumin beads, indicating a role for integrins. Cells exhibited reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, increased caspase-3 activation, nuclear condensation, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick end labeling staining, and detachment from the culture dish. The caspase-3 inhibitor acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde reduced detachment 3-fold. There was a rapid (<10-s) decrease in plasma membrane potential after force application, which, in filamin A-deficient melanoma cells, contributed to irreversible cell depolarization. In fibroblast cultures, cells with increased permeability to propidium iodide exhibited approximately 2-fold less filamin A content than impermeable cells. Fibroblasts transfected with antisense filamin A constructs or with filamin A constructs without an actin-binding domain exhibited 2-3-fold increased proportions of dead cells relative to controls.

Many malignant tumours express high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on their membranes. Therefore, LDL may be used as a carrier to obtain selective delivery of anti-neoplastic drugs to tumours. The present study was performed to investigate the feasibility of the murine B16 tumour/mouse model for the evaluation of LDL-mediated tumour therapy. LDL binds with high affinity to LDL receptors on cultured B16 cells (Kd, 5.9 +/- 2.3 micrograms ml-1; Bmax 206 +/- 23 ng LDL mg-1 cell protein). After binding and internalisation, LDL was very efficiently degraded: 724 +/- 19 ng LDL mg-1 cell protein h-1. Chloroquine and ammonium chloride completely inhibited the degradation of LDL by the B16 cells, indicating involvement of lysosomes. LDL receptors were down-regulated by 70% after preincubation of B16 cells with 300 micrograms ml-1 LDL, indicating that their expression is regulated by intracellular cholesterol. To evaluate the uptake of LDL by the B16 tumour in vivo, tissue distribution studies were performed in C57/B1 mice inoculated with B16 tumours. For these experiments, LDL was radiolabelled with tyramine cellobiose, a non-degradable label, which is retained in cells after uptake. At 24 h after injection of LDL, the liver, adrenals and the spleen were found to be the major organs involved in LDL uptake, with tissue-serum (T/S) ratios of 0.82 +/- 0.08, 1.17 +/- 0.20 and 0.69 +/- 0.08 respectively. Of all the other tissues, the tumour showed the highest uptake of LDL (T/S ratio of 0.40 +/- 0.07). A large part of the LDL uptake was receptor mediated, as the uptake of methylated LDL was much lower. Although the LDL uptake by the liver, spleen and adrenals is higher than that by the tumour, the LDL receptor-mediated uptake by these organs may be selectively down-regulated by methods that do not affect the expression of LDL receptors on tumour cells. It is concluded that the B16 tumour-bearing mouse constitutes a good model to evaluate the effectiveness of LDL-mediated delivery of cytotoxic (pro)drugs to tumours in vivo.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The cancer-testis antigens are a group of unrelated proteins aberrantly expressed in various cancers in adult somatic tissues. This aberrant expression can trigger spontaneous immune responses, a phenomenon exploited for the development of disease markers and therapeutic vaccines. However, expression levels often vary amongst patients presenting the same cancer type, and these antigens are therefore unlikely to be individually viable as diagnostic or prognostic markers. Nevertheless, patterns of antigen expression may provide correlates of specific cancer types and disease progression. Herein, we describe the development of a novel, readily customizable cancer-testis antigen microarray platform together with robust bioinformatics tools, with which to quantify anti-cancer testis antigen autoantibody profiles in patient sera. By exploiting the high affinity between autoantibodies and tumor antigens, we achieved linearity of response and an autoantibody quantitation limit in the pg/mL range-equating to a million-fold serum dilution. By using oriented attachment of folded, recombinant antigens and a polyethylene glycol microarray surface coating, we attained minimal non-specific antibody binding. Unlike other proteomics methods, which typically use lower affinity interactions between monoclonal antibodies and tumor antigens for detection, the high sensitivity and specificity realized using our autoantibody-based approach may facilitate the development of better cancer biomarkers, as well as potentially enabling pre-symptomatic diagnosis. We illustrated the usage of our platform by monitoring the response of a melanoma patient cohort to an experimental therapeutic NY-ESO-1-based cancer vaccine; inter alia, we found evidence of determinant spreading in individual patients, as well as differential CT antigen expression and epitope usage.

The physical stability of emulsions was monitored by particle size changes in both the mean droplet diameter and 99% cumulative distribution.

Conjugation of 4-nitrophenyl-(RS)-2-[(18)F]fluoropropionate provided [(18)F]FProp-Cys(*)-Arg-Arg-Glu-Thr-Ala-Trp-Ala-Cys(*)-OH in high radiochemical purity (>95%) and a radiochemical yield of approx. 55%. In vitro evaluation showed α(5)β(1) binding affinity in the nanomolar range, whereas affinity to α(v)β(3) and α(IIb)β(3) was >50 μM. Cell uptake studies using human melanoma M21 (α(v)β(3)-positive and α(5)β(1)-negative), human melanoma M21-L (α(v)β(3)-negative and α(5)β(1)-negative), and human prostate carcinoma DU145 (α(v)β(3)-negative and α(5)β(1)-positive) confirmed receptor-specific binding.

Radiolabelled r-BHD was tested for affinity towards avidin and for stability in saline or in human serum with and without ascorbic acid. Pharmacokinetic data were collected and organ biodistribution evaluated in a tumour-bearing pretargeted animal model. A pilot study was performed in a metastatic melanoma patient and dosimetry was estimated.;High radiochemical purity (>99%) was routinely achieved with (90)Y or (177)Lu in sodium acetate buffer (1.0 M, pH 5.0) at a specific activity of 2.6 MBq/nmol. Both (90)Y- and (177)Lu-r-BHD were also prepared at higher specific activities. Radiolabelled r-BHD was stable up to 96 h in human serum and saline with the addition of ascorbic acid. The structural modifications proposed for the r-BHD stabilised it against enzymatic degradation while retaining high binding affinity for avidin. Renal clearance appeared to be the main route of excretion in animals, and high tumour uptake was observed in the pretargeted animals. The patient study showed a total body clearance of approximately 85% in 24 h, with a kidney absorbed dose of 1.5 mGy/MBq.

Mechanisms by which the antibodies induce tumor suppression, however, have not been systematically studied. To investigate this point, we produced and characterized C57BL/6 mice transgenic for IgM antibody to ganglioside GD2. The transgenic (TG) mice showed high IgM, but not IgG antibody titers against GD2 in their sera. No significant clinical symptoms were observed. When EL4 cells, syngeneic T lymphoma that express ganglioside GD2, were injected into TG mice, prolonged survival was observed. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) of EL4 cells was mediated with TG mice sera. Neither antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity with their sera nor cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity to EL4 cells was shown in TG mice. Spleen lymphocytes from TG mice had increased numbers of natural killer (NK) cells, but not T cells, B cells, or macrophages compared with wild-type mice. Depletion of NK cells with anti-asialo GM1 rabbit serum reduced or abrogated the observed anti-tumor effects, suggesting that NK cells play a major role in tumor eradication or suppression. NK cell activity in TG mice was much higher than wild-type mice. Moreover, TG mice showed prolonged survival after injection with syngeneic B16 melanoma cells, which express GM3, but not GD2 or GD3. Taking these results together, our studies demonstrate that the TG mice have significant anti-tumor characteristics, probably due to CDC and NK cell expansion and activation with anti-ganglioside GD2 antibody.",

IgG4 plays a protective role in allergy by acting as a blocking antibody, and inhibiting mast cell degranulation, but a deleterious role in malignant melanoma, by impeding IgG1-mediated anti-tumor immunity. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the interaction between IgG4 and Fcγ receptors. Despite a wealth of structural information for the IgG1 subclass, including complexes with Fcγ receptors, and structures for intact antibodies, high-resolution crystal structures were not reported for IgG4-Fc until recently.

RT-PCR specific for Tenascin C and EGFR was performed on RNAs extracted from blood samples of 60 patients affected by colon or bladder cancer. We then investigated the statistical association between Tenascin C, EGFR expression and disease-free survival using the Kaplan-Meier method. Furthermore, in order to select which variable between EGFR and Tenascin C was the most predictive for recurrence, a Cox model for proportional risk was applied. Among all patients analysed, a significantly higher disease-free time was found in the group negative for both EGFR and Tenascin C expression; EGFR expression was significantly correlated to disease progression in stages III and IV, whereas in all patients with stage I and II disease Tenascin C correlated better with prognosis. Negative expression of both EGFR and Tenascin C identifies a group of patients with poor tendency to disease recurrence and longer relapse-free time.

Many factors are associated with a worse outcome; examples include late diagnosis, low resection rate, aggressive tumor behavior and a lack of an effective chemotherapy regimen. Owing to the low prevalence of pancreatic cancer relative to the diagnostic accuracy of present detection methods and the absence of promising treatment modalities, even in early stages, it is currently neither advisable nor cost effective to screen the general population. Efforts are focused on early screening of selected high-risk-cohorts, who account for approximately 10% of patients with pancreatic cancer. These include patients with chronic pancreatitis, individuals with a family history of pancreatic cancer, patients with hereditary pancreatitis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, cystic fibrosis or familial atypical multiple mole melanoma. At present, a multimodal-screening approach of endoscopic ultrasound, computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography appears to be the most effective method to screen for pancreatic cancer in high-risk patients. Continued efforts are needed to elucidate effective testing to identify patients with nonhereditary risk factors who will benefit from screening protocols.

        "Doc_abstract":"We have developed a totally implanted drug delivery system capable of maintaining constant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug levels through continuous intraventricular infusion in outpatients. This system was used to infuse methotrexate (MTX) intraventricularly in seven patients with incurable CNS malignancies. One patient with meningeal diffuse histiocytic lymphoma, five patients with grade III--IV astrocytomas, and one patient with melanoma metastatic to the brain were treated with this system for 4--40+ weeks. The system consists of an Infusaid pump (Metal Bellows Corp, Sharon, MA), implanted subcutaneously in the infraclavicular fossa, which delivers a drug-containing solution at a set rate (3--5 mg/day) through a subcutaneous silastic catheter to a Rickham ventriculostomy reservoir and into a lateral ventricle. System placement and maintenance were readily tolerated. Constant MTX infusion at rates of 0.5--10 mg/day generated corresponding constant CSF drug levels in the range of 2--30 microM. Simultaneous serum MTX levels were undetectable (less than 0.01 microM), indicative of a 200- to 3000-fold selective regional concentration advantage for this approach. CNS toxic effects included transient meningism and fever (four patients), transverse myelitis (one), and the development of a diffuse hypodensity of the white matter on computerized tomographic scan which was not associated with any neurologic deficit (two). The usual systemic toxic effects (myelosuppression and mucositis) of MTX were not seen. The patient with meningeal lymphoma has had a complete remission of meningeal disease continuing past 10 months. Computerized tomography showed that three of the five high-grade astrocytomas had 25% size reductions in tumors lasting 2--6 months. This system may provide a means for improved treatment of meningeal tumor although its role in the treatment of intraparenchymal brain tumors is less clear. Of greater consequence, however, is the demonstrated ability of this system to maintain a controlled CSF drug level which should prove useful in many areas of therapeutic research.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The major problem associated with ELISA of serum antiganglioside antibodies is the high background values (absorbancy of sera added to wells without ganglioside), which interfere with the accurate assessment of the fine specificity and sensitivity of these antibodies. This investigation identifies factors elevating the background values and/or decreasing the fine specificity, and describes strategies to minimize their influence. Using sera of neuropathy and melanoma patients, we found that highest background values were observed with the polystyrene 'tissue culture' microtiter plates; of the various 'non-tissue culture' microtiter plates tested, the lowest background values (> 0.060) were observed with Costar-3590 (H), Immunolon-3, Immunolon-1, Falcon-3915 (in increasing order). Background artifact of polystyrene microtest plates was significantly reduced by gamma irradiation (at 40 kRad) and/or use of detergent Tween-20 (0.1%) in the washing step. Even after controlling the background values, the fine specificity, namely, the ability of the antibody to distinguish between the target epitope of an antigen and epitopes of related antigens (when moles of antigen/well is constant) varied with different microtiter plates. Using sera with high affinity and specificity for GM2, GD3 or GM3, we observed that Immunolon-1, Immunolon-3 and particularly Falcon-3915 were superior for assessing the abilities of the antibodies to distinguish closely related epitopes found on other gangliosides. The reactivity of antiganglioside antibodies was more consistent after detergent treatment. The reactivity of antibodies to GD3 is significantly enhanced after treatment with Tween-20, but that of antibodies reacting to GM1 and GM2 is reduced. Fine specificity of the antiglycolipid antibodies was resolved better by coating glycolipids in mol/well rather than by weight/well. Based on these results, a protocol for a sensitive and reproducible ELISA for serum antiganglioside antibodies is recommended. The protocol takes into consideration the suitability of polystyrene plates, coating based on the number of molecules, pertinency of the solvent for coating, use of human serum albumin for blocking, dilution and washing steps and use of 0.1% Tween-20 to further minimize the background absorbancy.",

In this report, a model N-S-N(Py) ligand (3) and a cysteine-derived α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) peptide (6) were used as novel demonstrations of a widely applicable chelation strategy for incorporation of the [M(I)(CO)(3)](+) (M = Re, (99m)Tc) core into peptide-based molecules for radiopharmaceutical applications. The structural details of the core ligand-metal complexes as model systems were demonstrated by full chemical characterization of fac-[Re(I)(CO)(3)(N,S,N(Py)-3)](+) (4) and comparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis between 4 and [(99m)Tc(I)(CO)(3)(N,S,N(Py)-3)](+) (4a). The α-MSH analogue bearing the N-S-N(Py) chelate on a modified cysteine residue (6) was generated and complexed with [M(I)(CO)(3)](+) to confirm the chelation strategy's utility when applied in a peptide-based targeting agent. Characterization of the Re(I)(CO)(3)-6 peptide conjugate (7) confirmed the efficient incorporation of the metal center, and the (99m)Tc(I)(CO)(3)-6 analogue (7a) was explored as a potential single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) compound for imaging the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) in melanoma. Peptide 7a showed excellent radiolabeling yields and in vitro stability during amino acid challenge and serum stability assays. In vitro B16F10 melanoma cell uptake of 7a reached a modest value of 2.3 ± 0.08% of applied activity at 2 h at 37 °C, while this uptake was significantly reduced by coincubation with a nonlabeled α-MSH analogue, NAPamide (3.2 μM) (P < 0.05). In vivo SPECT/X-ray computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging and biodistribution of 7a were evaluated in a B16F10 melanoma xenografted mouse model. SPECT/CT imaging clearly visualized the tumor at 1 h post injection (p.i.) with high tumor-to-background contrast. Blocking studies with coinjected NAPamide (10 mg per kg of mouse body weight) confirmed the in vivo specificity of 7a for MC1R-positive tumors. Biodistribution results with 7a yielded a moderate tumor uptake of 1.20 ± 0.09 percentage of the injected radioactive dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g) at 1 h p.i. Relatively high uptake of 7a was also seen in the kidneys and liver at 1 h p.i. (6.55 ± 0.36% ID/g and 4.44 ± 0.17% ID/g, respectively), although reduced kidney uptake was seen at 4 h p.i. (3.20 ± 0.48% ID/g). These results demonstrate the utility of the novel [M(I)(CO)(3)](+) chelation strategy when applied in a targeting peptide.",

Through an immunological cascade, anti-idiotypic antibodies bearing the internal image of epitopes of the nominal antigen (Ab2 beta) are produced that themselves can induce cellular and humoral cytotoxic effects against the antigen-expressing tumor cell. Formation of such antibodies has been shown to be associated with prolonged survival of melanoma, colorectal, and ovarian carcinoma patients. We studied anti-idiotypic antibody (Ab2) responses and clinical outcome of 31 ovarian cancer patients receiving the monoclonal antibody (MAb) B72.3, which targets the ovarian carcinoma associated antigen TAG-72. All patients were treated by surgery and polychemotherapy, which was followed by repeated (mean of 4) injections of 1 mg of the MAb B72.3. A remarkable anti-idiotypic anti-B72.3 response arose in 19 patients, with 9 of them showing a major response with Ab2 serum concentrations greater than 1,000 U/ml (\"high-responders\"). The median disease-free survival time, as well as the median survival time of these high-responders, was increased as compared to the low- or no responders.

To further characterize the bovine pituitary alpha TGF, it was compared to a human alpha TGF partially purified from the conditioned medium of a human melanoma cell line. An anti-alpha TGF monoclonal antibody, MF9, was produced from hybridomas derived from mice immunized with a 17-residue synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal sequence of rat alpha TGF. The hybridoma supernatants were initially screened for the ability to immunoprecipitate 125I-peptide and then tested for recognition of human alpha TGF. Only 2 of 36 antipeptide antibodies recognized the native alpha TGF. The binding of 125I-peptide to MF9 was displaced by human alpha TGF but not by EGF. Bovine pituitary alpha TGF also displaced the binding of 125I-peptide to MF9 in a similar manner to human alpha TGF. Both iodinated human and bovine pituitary alpha TGF were immunoprecipitated by MF9 whereas 125I-EGF was not. Recognition of alpha TGF by MF9 was strongly dependent on sulfhydryl reduction of the growth factors, suggesting that synthetic peptides representing sulfhydryl-rich protein are not ideal immunogens. Tryptic digests of both 125I-alpha TGFs chromatographed to give a single, indistinguishable peak of iodinated material on a reverse-phase C18 high performance liquid chromatography column when eluted with two different solvent systems, suggesting the generation of a single and identical tyrosine-containing tryptic peptide from both alpha TGFs. The comparisons of the bovine pituitary and human melanoma alpha TGF using a sequence-specific monoclonal antibody and peptide mapping suggest that these alpha TGFs are related and that alpha TGF production is not limited to transformed or fetal sources.",

Monoclonal antibodies to tumor-associated antigens facilitate the characterization of molecular differences between tumors and normal cells. Labelled with gamma-emitting radioisotopes like I-131, I-123, In-111, and Tc99M, these antibodies can be used for in-vivo imaging. Radioimmunoscintigraphy does not compete with morphological modalities like CT and ultrasound, but provides additional information based on its functional principle. Hidden lesions may be detected. Target-to-background ratios, however, are still rather low hampering scintigraphic imaging. The use of Single Photon Emissions Computed Tomography (SPECT) in addition to planar scintigraphy resolves background activities thus providing better visualization and localization of tumors, and increasing sensitivity. The high cost of these time-consuming studies is still a limiting factor to its wider use. Its preliminary indication is founded on the suspicion of tumor progression, based on clinical findings and/or increasing serum tumor markers (CEA, CA 19-9, CA 12-5).

The presence of CML66-specific antibody in patient serum was confirmed by Western blot and the development of high titer IgG antibody specific for CML66 correlated with immune induced remission of CML in a patient who received infusion of normal donor lymphocytes for treatment of relapse.

The c-fms gene is itself a macrophage differentiation marker. In whole mount analyses of mRNA expression in embryos, c-fms is expressed at very high levels on placental trophoblasts. It is detectable on individual cells in the yolk sac around 8.5 to 9 days postcoitus, appears on isolated cells in the head of the embryo around 9.5 dpc, and appears on numerous cells throughout the embryo by day 10.5. The extent of c-fms expression is much greater than for other macrophage-specific genes including lysozyme and a macrophage-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase. Our studies of the cis-acting elements of the c-fms promoter have indicated a key role for collaboration between the macrophage-specific transcription factor, Pu.1, which functions in determining the site of transcription initiation, and other members of the Ets transcription factor family. This is emerging as a common pattern in macrophage-specific promoters. We have shown that two PU box elements alone can function as a macrophage-specific promoter. The activity of both the artificial promoter and the c-fms promoter is activated synergistically by coexpression of Pu.1 and another Ets factor, c-Ets-2. A 3.5kb c-fms exon 2 promoter (but not the 300bp proximal promoter) is also active in a wide diversity of tumor cell lines. The interesting exception is the melanoma cell line K1735, in which the promoter is completely shut down and expression of c-fms causes growth arrest and cell death. The activity of the exon 2 promoter in these nonmacrophages is at least as serum responsive as the classic serum-responsive promoter of the c-fos gene. It is further inducible in nonmacrophages by coexpression of the c-fms product. Unlike other CSF-1/c-fms-responsive promoters, the c-fms promoter is not responsive to activated Ras even when c-Ets-2 is coexpressed. In most lines, production of full length c-fms is prevented by a downstream intronic terminator, but in Lewis lung carcinoma, read-through does occur, and expression of both c-fms and other macrophage-specific genes such as lysozyme and urokinase becomes detectable in conditions of serum deprivation.",

The reactivity of patients with clinically localized tumors was compared with that of cured patients and a large normal population. Patients with squamous carcinomas of the head and neck region and female pelvic organs displayed higher incidences of impaired cellular immune competence than patients with malignancies of other histologic types. Among cured patients, those previously treated for squamous carcinoma were unique in that they displayed cellular immune defects and serum suppressants of in vitro immune reactivity similar to tumor-bearing patients. Antibodies to herpes simplex virus nonvirion antigen was found in high incidence only among patients with squamous carcinomas, and the incidences in tumor-bearing and cured patients were similar. The persisting immune defects in cured squamous carcinoma patients give importance to the determination of the role of genetic and environmental factors in the induction of these tumors. The associations made between herpes virus and squamous carcinoma offer an explanation for the defects and also an approach for the definition of the factors involved in squamous carcinogenesis. The findings are clinically relevant to the isolation of population groups at high risk for the development of squamous carcinoma, as a rational basis for the development of prophylactic measures, and as a basis for more effective therapeutic regimens.",

Human BT-20 breast and ME-180 cervix cancer cells were growth-inhibited by rTNF, whereas two other cell lines were not significantly inhibited. However, when protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide, rTNF was cytotoxic for these cells but not for BT-20 cells. This finding suggested that different mechanisms are responsible for the cytostatic and cytotoxic activity of rTNF. The sensitivity of different cell lines to rTNF could not be correlated with a high number or affinity of rTNF receptors. Occupancy of only a few receptors was sufficient for rTNA cytotoxicity, but an increase in receptor number after treatment with interferon-gamma, or a decrease after pretreatment with cycloheximide, correspondingly enhanced or depressed the cytotoxicity of rTNF. It seemed possible that some cells could be protected from this effect of rTNF by synthesizing \"protective\" proteins. While searching for such proteins, we observed that rTNF induced the synthesis of two polypeptides in SK-MEL-109 melanoma cells, but not in other cancer cells. Actinomycin D added with rTNF abolished synthesis of these polypeptides, suggesting that rTNF induced transcription of the corresponding mRNAs. Surprisingly, rTNF stimulated growth of SK-MEL-109 cells cultured in medium with low serum.",

At concentrations of 10 nM or less, AMF stimulated the random or directed motility of the producer cells. However, AMF is not an attractant for neutrophils. Amino acid analysis of the purified AMF protein revealed a high content of serine, glycine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid residues. The activity of AMF was not replaced or blocked by known growth factors such as epidermal growth factor or type beta transforming growth factor. Mechanistic studies showed that AMF stimulated the incorporation of [3H]methyl into cell membrane phospholipids after incubation with [methyl-3H]methionine with a sustained increase in the methylation of phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine. In contrast, AMF did not affect the incorporation of [1,2-14C]choline into phosphatidylcholine. AMF was produced in large amounts by three different clones of ras oncogene-transfected metastatic NIH 3T3 cells but not by the nontransformed parental cells.

In this work three gold(III) complexes of the fluoroquinolones antimicrobial agents norfloxacin (NOR), levofloxacin (LEVO) and sparfloxacin (SPAR) were prepared and characterized with physicochemical and spectroscopic techniques. In these complexes, NOR, LEVO and SPAR act as bidentate neutral ligands bound to gold(III) through the nitrogen atoms of the piperazine ring, which is an unusual mode of coordination for this class of compounds. Two chloride ions occupy the remaining coordination sites. The cytotoxic activity of the fluoroquinolones and their gold(III) complexes was tested against the A20 (murine lymphoma), B16-F10 (murine melanoma) and K562 (human myeloid leukemia) tumor cell lines as well as the L919 (murine lung fibroblasts) and MCR-5 (human lung fibroblasts) normal cells lines. All complexes were more active than their corresponding free ligands. Complex [AuCl(2)(LEVO)]Cl was selected for DNA fragmentation and cell cycle analysis.

Integrin α5β1 and αvβ3 affinities were determined in enzyme linked immune sorbent assay on immobilized integrins, using fibronectin and vitronectin, respectively, as competitors. M21 (human melanoma)-bearing severe combined immunodeficient mice were used for biodistribution, PET imaging, and determination of in vivo metabolization. The expression of α5 and β3 subunits was determined by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections of M21 tumors.;(68)Ga-aquibeprin shows high selectivity for integrin α5β1 (50% inhibition concentration [IC50] = 0.088 nM) over αvβ3 (IC50 = 620 nM) and a pronounced hydrophilicity (log D = -4.2). Severe combined immunodeficient mice xenografted with M21 human melanoma were found suitable for in vivo evaluation, as M21 immunohistochemistry showed not only an endothelial and strong cytoplasmatic expression of the β3 integrin subunit but also an intense expression of the α5 integrin subunit particularly in the endothelial cells of intratumoral small vessels. Ex vivo biodistribution (90 min after injection) showed high uptake in M21 tumor (2.42 ± 0.21 percentage injected dose per gram), fast renal excretion, and low background; tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios were 10.6 ± 2.5 and 20.9 ± 2.4, respectively. (68)Ga-aquibeprin is stable in vivo; no metabolites were detected in mouse urine, blood serum, kidney, and liver homogenates 30 min after injection. PET imaging was performed for (68)Ga-aquibeprin and the previously described, structurally related c(RGDfK) trimer (68)Ga-avebetrin, which shows an inverse selectivity for integrin αvβ3 (IC50 = 0.22 nM) over α5β1 (IC50 = 39 nM). In vivo target specificity was proven by cross-competition studies; tumor uptake of either tracer was not affected by the coadministration of 40 nmol (∼5 mg/kg) of the respective other compound.;(68)Ga-aquibeprin and (68)Ga-avebetrin are recommendable for complementary mapping of integrins α5β1 and αvβ3 by PET, allowing for future studies on the role of these integrins in angiogenesis, tumor progression, metastasis, and myocardial infarct healing.",

Here, random peptide bacteriophage display libraries were used to identify sequences that bound the cancer-associated Thomsen-Friedenreich glycoantigen (T antigen). The T antigen, present on most malignant cells, contains an immunodominant Gal beta1 --> 3GalNAc alpha disaccharide unmasked on the surfaces of most carcinomas. This antigen has been postulated to be involved in tumor cell aggregation and metastasis. Two 15 amino acid random peptide bacteriophage display libraries were affinity selected with glycoproteins displaying T antigen on their surfaces. Sequence analysis revealed that many of the peptides shared homology with sugar recognition sites in several carbohydrate-binding proteins. A comparison of affinity selected sequences from both libraries yielded a common motif (W-Y-A-W/F-S-P) rich in aromatic amino acids. Four peptides, corresponding to the affinity selected sequences, were chemically synthesized and characterized for their carbohydrate recognition properties. The synthetic peptides exhibited high specificities and affinities to T antigen displayed on asialofetuin or conjugated to bovine serum albumin (Kd = 5 nM for MAP-P30 binding to asialofetuin) as well as free T-antigen disaccharide in solution (Kd = 10 microM for MAP-P30, 20 microM for P10). Two peptides, P30 and P10, demonstrated high affinities and specificities for both asialofetuin and T antigen in solution. Iodination of a lone tyrosine residue in each sequence dramatically reduced their abilities to bind T antigen, suggesting that the tyrosine residue plays an important role in carbohydrate recognition. That these peptides are of functional significance is evidenced by the ability of both P30 and P10 to inhibit asialofetuin-mediated melanoma cell aggregation in vitro and to compete with peanut lectin for binding to T antigen displayed on the surface of MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells in situ.",

Suppression could be achieved with tumor cell:PBMC ratios as low as 1:50 when tumor cells were derived from melanoma and colorectal cancer (G361, COLO320, HT-29), but suppression was not observed with cells from the breast cancer cell line SKBr3. No suppression of LAK generation was observed with normal epithelial cells from colon or breast, with autologous or allogeneic lymphoblasts, or with allogeneic vascular endothelial cells. Suppression was independent of the removal of adherent cells from PBMC, could not be prevented by indomethacin and was not attributable to interleukin 2 absorption/adsorption by tumor cells. The suppressive activity of some tumor cells could be augmented by preculture in recombinant gamma interferon. Serum-free supernatants from G361, COLO320 and HT-29 (but not SKBr3 or endothelial cells) were also highly suppressive towards the generation of LAK cells.

Since such restorative activity was seen even against the subline of B16 F1 which had been made resistant to its direct antiproliferative effect, alpha A/D seems to exert its effect indirectly through host defense systems.

        "Doc_abstract":"Our specific aim in a 10-year prospective study of 772 Cincinnati firemen (predominantly aged 26 to 46 years) was to determine the prevalence, attributes, and etiology of persistent hypobetalipoproteinemia, defined by entry low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) less than 75 mg/dL. A second specific aim was to cross-sectionally assess hypocholesterolemia (defined by total serum cholesterol [TC] < 130 mg/dL) in 1,314 white and 165 black men aged 26 to 46 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I). The 141 black and 631 white firemen had 4,973 person-years of follow-up time (median, 7.1 yr/man). Of 772 men, 44 (5.7%) had entry LDL levels less than 75 mg/dL; they had a mean follow-up time of 7.3 yr/man. Of these 44 men, there were 12 (1.8% of the cohort) with entry LDLC less than 75 mg/dL, and at least 67% of their follow-up LDLC levels were less than 75. Their mean entry TC and LDLC levels were low (130 and 58 mg/dL), mean triglyceride (TG) was low (63 mg/dL), and mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) was high (60 mg/dL), LDLC remained at less than 75 mg/dL in 81% of their follow-up samples. Their mean entry and follow-up cholesterol and LDLC did not differ (P > .1, 130 v 133 mg/dL and 58 v 63 mg/dL). Compared with 32 men with entry LDLC less than 75 mg/dL but with less than 87% of follow-up LDLC less than 75 mg/dL, the 12 men with persistently low LDLC had lower mean Quetelet indices and diastolic blood pressure at entry (2.36 v 2.58, P = .056; 73 v 80 mm Hg, P = .03) and on follow-up study (2.45 v 2.69, P = .04; 72 v 79 mm Hg, P = .05). Of 12 men with persistently low LDLC, two had truncated apolipoprotein (apo) B (familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, two had the apo E genotype 2/3, and two had acquired hypobetalipoproteinemia that antedated mortality from melanoma by 9 years and from alcoholism by 2 years. Comparable to white and black firemen aged 26 to 46 years, 2.9% and 3.6% of whom had entry serum TC less than 130 mg/dL, of 1,314 white and 165 black men in the NHANES I study (aged 26 to 46), 1.8% and 3.6% had hypocholesterolemia (entry TC < 130 mg/dL). Daily mean calorie, fat, and protein intake (grams per day) did not differ (P > .05) in men with entry TC less than 130 mg/dL compared with those with TC 130 to 230 or greater than 230 mg/dL. Hypocholesterolemia in white and black men in NHANES I could not be attributed to hypocaloric intake or to protein, fat, or carbohydrate undernutrition. There appear to be racial differences in the prevalence of hypocholesterolemia. Blacks comprised 18% of the firemen's cohort but 42% of those with persistent hypobetalipoproteinemia; among NHANES I subjects, 3.6% of blacks were hypocholesterolemic versus 1.8% of whites. Unless persistent hypobetalipoproteinemia reflects an underlying disease, alcoholism, etc., it is often heritable, and may be associated with a reduced likelihood of coronary heart disease (CHD) and with increased longevity.",

        "Doc_abstract":"To review and synthesize the literature in the following areas: the association of specific circulating 25(OH)D concentrations with bone health outcomes in children, women of reproductive age, postmenopausal women and elderly men; the effect of dietary intakes (foods fortified with vitamin D and/or vitamin D supplementation) and sun exposure on serum 25(OH)D; the effect of vitamin D on bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture or fall risk; and the identification of potential harms of vitamin D above current reference intakes.;MEDLINE(R) (1966-June Week 3 2006); Embase (2002-2006 Week 25); CINAHL (1982-June Week 4, 2006); AMED (1985 to June 2006); Biological Abstracts (1990-February 2005); and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2nd Quarter 2006).;Two independent reviewers completed a multi-level process of screening the literature to identify eligible studies (title and abstract, followed by full text review, and categorization of study design per key question). To minimize bias, study design was limited to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) wherever possible. Study criteria for question one were broadened to include observational studies due to a paucity of available RCTs, and question four was restricted to systematic reviews to limit scope. Data were abstracted in duplicate and study quality assessed. Differences in opinion were resolved through consensus or adjudication. If clinically relevant and statistically feasible, meta-analyses of RCTs on vitamin D supplementation and bone health outcomes were conducted, with exploration of heterogeneity. When meta-analysis was not feasible, a qualitative systematic review of eligible studies was conducted.;167 studies met our eligibility criteria (112 RCTs, 19 prospective cohorts, 30 case-controls and six before-after studies). The largest body of evidence on vitamin D status and bone health was in older adults with a lack of studies in premenopausal women and infants, children and adolescents. The quality of RCTs was highest in the vitamin D efficacy trials for prevention of falls and/or fractures in older adults. There was fair evidence of an association between low circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and established rickets. However, the specific 25(OH)D concentrations associated with rickets is uncertain, given the lack of studies in populations with dietary calcium intakes similar to North American diets and the different methods used to determine 25(OH)D concentrations. There was inconsistent evidence of an association of circulating 25(OH)D with bone mineral content in infants, and fair evidence that serum 25(OH)D is inversely associated with serum PTH. In adolescents, there was fair evidence for an association between 25(OH)D levels and changes in BMD. There were very few studies in pregnant and lactating women, and insufficient evidence for an association between serum 25(OH)D and changes in BMD during lactation, and fair evidence of an inverse correlation with PTH. In older adults, there was fair evidence that serum 25(OH)D is inversely associated with falls, fair evidence for a positive association with BMD, and inconsistent evidence for an association with fractures. The imprecision of 25(OH)D assays may have contributed to the variable thresholds of 25(OH)D below which the risk of fractures, falls or bone loss was increased. There was good evidence that intakes from vitamin D-fortified foods (11 RCTs) consistently increased serum 25(OH)D in both young and older adults. Eight randomized trials of ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation (artificial and solar exposure) were small and heterogeneous with respect to determination of the exact UV-B dose and 25(OH)D assay but there was a positive effect on serum 25(OH)D concentrations. It was not possible to determine how 25(OH)D levels varied by ethnicity, sunscreen use or latitude. Seventy-four trials examined the effect of vitamin D(3) or D(2) on 25(OH)D concentrations. Most trials used vitamin D(3), and the majority enrolled older adults. In three trials, there was a greater response of serum 25(OH)D concentrations to vitamin D(3) compared to vitamin D(2), which may have been due to more rapid clearance of vitamin D(2) in addition to other mechanisms. Meta-analysis of 16 trials of vitamin D(3) was consistent with a dose-response effect on serum 25(OH)D when comparing daily doses of <400 IU to doses >/= 400 IU. An exploratory analysis of the heterogeneity demonstrated a significant positive association comparable to an increase of 1 - 2 nmol/L in serum 25(OH)D for every 100 additional units of vitamin D although heterogeneity remained after adjusting for dose. Vitamin D(3) in combination with calcium results in small increases in BMD compared to placebo in older adults although quantitative synthesis was limited due to variable treatment durations and BMD sites. The evidence for fracture reduction with vitamin D supplementation was inconsistent across 15 trials. The combined results of trials using vitamin D(3) (700 - 800 IU daily) with calcium (500 - 1,200 mg) was consistent with a benefit on fractures although in a subgroup analysis by setting, benefit was primarily in elderly institutionalized women (fair evidence from two trials). There was inconsistent evidence across 14 RCTs of a benefit on fall risk. However, a subgroup analysis showed a benefit of vitamin D in postmenopausal women, and in trials that used vitamin D(3) plus calcium. In addition, there was a reduction in fall risk with vitamin D when six trials that adequately ascertained falls were combined. Limitations of the fall and fracture trials included poor compliance with vitamin D supplementation, incomplete assessment of vitamin D status and large losses to follow-up. We did not find any systematic reviews that addressed the question on the level of sunlight exposure that is sufficient to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations but minimizes risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. There is little evidence from existing trials that vitamin D above current reference intakes is harmful. In most trials, reports of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria were not associated with clinically relevant events. The Women's Health Initiative study did report a small increase in kidney stones in postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years whose daily vitamin D(3) intake was 400 IU (the reference intake for 50 to 70 years, and below the reference intake for > 70 years) combined with 1000 mg calcium. The increase in renal stones corresponded to 5.7 events per 10,000 person-years of exposure. The women in this trial had higher calcium intakes than is seen in most post-menopausal women.;The results highlight the need for additional high quality studies in infants, children, premenopausal women, and diverse racial or ethnic groups. There was fair evidence from studies of an association between circulating 25(OH)D concentrations with some bone health outcomes (established rickets, PTH, falls, BMD). However, the evidence for an association was inconsistent for other outcomes (e.g., BMC in infants and fractures in adults). It was difficult to define specific thresholds of circulating 25(OH)D for optimal bone health due to the imprecision of different 25(OH)D assays. Standard reference preparations are needed so that serum 25(OH)D can be accurately and reliably measured, and validated. In most trials, the effects of vitamin D and calcium could not be separated. Vitamin D(3) (>700 IU/day) with calcium supplementation compared to placebo has a small beneficial effect on BMD, and reduces the risk of fractures and falls although benefit may be confined to specific subgroups. Vitamin D intake above current dietary reference intakes was not reported to be associated with an increased risk of adverse events. However, most trials of higher doses of vitamin D were not adequately designed to assess long-term harms."},

        "Doc_abstract":"Peripheral blood monocytes can be induced by stimuli such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to secrete an array of cytokines. We have studied the effects of interleukin 7 (IL-7) on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and found that IL-7 is a relatively potent inducer of IL-6 secretion IL-6 protein levels were determined either by the B9 hybridoma growth factor assay or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and mRNA for IL-6 was analyzed by Northern hybridization. Detailed examination revealed that, among PBMC, monocytes, rather than lymphocytes, were secreting IL-6 in response to IL-7. In contrast to the low concentrations of IL-7 required to stimulate T cell growth and differentiation (as low as 0.1 ng/ml), relatively high concentrations of IL-7 were necessary to induce IL-6 secretion by monocytes (at least 10 ng/ml). An optimal concentration of IL-7 (100 ng/ml) induced monocytes to secrete 10-fold more IL-6 than an optimal concentration of IL-1 beta (10 ng/ml), and almost as much as LPS. However, significantly more IL-7 than IL-1 beta was required to induce detectable levels of IL-6. The kinetics of IL-6 secretion by monocytes were identical in response to IL-7, IL-1 beta, or LPS, with IL-6 protein detectable in culture supernatants as early as 2 h after the initiation of culture. IL-4 was found to markedly inhibit the ability of IL-7 or LPS to induce IL-6 mRNA and IL-6 secretion. In addition to promoting IL-6 production, IL-7 induced the secretion of immunoreactive IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by monocytes. IL-7 also induced monocyte/macrophage tumoricidal activity against a human melanoma cell target, an activity that may be related to the secretion of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha. Finally, we used a whole blood culture system as a bridge to in vivo analysis to demonstrate that IL-7 induces cytokine secretion in the absence of culture medium, fetal calf serum, and adherence to plastic. Our data suggest that IL-7, in addition to regulating lymphocyte growth and differentiation, has potent effects on cells of the monocytic lineage. Thus, IL-7 may be an important mediator in inflammation and in the macrophage immune response to tumors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancer growth and development is associated with the stimulation of the innate immune system, including enhanced interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) expression in immune cells and its shedding into the circulation in a soluble form of sIL-2Ralpha. In most haematological malignancies, including different types of leukaemias and lymphomas, sIL-2Ralpha has been found to be released directly from the surface of neoplastic cells thus reflecting the tumour bulk, turnover and activity. Several studies have proved that not only lymphoid cancer cells, but also some non-lymphoid cancer cells, express IL-2R on their surface. They include malignant melanoma and carcinomas of the kidney, head and neck, oesophagus and lung. It is suggested that in most malignant solid tumours, elevated levels of sIL-2Ralpha are likely to be the product of normal peripheral mononuclear cells activated in response to the neoplasm's growth or that they are released from activated lymphoid cells infiltrating neoplastic tissues. This latter hypothesis has been proved by discovering the high expression of CD25 on the cell surface of most of these cells. Although the precise source and biological role of sIL-2Ralpha has not been clarified definitively, pretreatment serum levels of sIL-2Ralpha have been shown to reflect the activity, advancement and biological aggressiveness of many types of cancer in adults and children as well as to correlate with prognosis and overall survival. The possibility of enriching the diagnostic tools of oncologists with a new biochemical marker of activity of neoplasms resulted in numerous studies and reports concerning the clinical usefulness of sIL-2Ralpha measurements in adult and, less frequently, in paediatric malignancies. This article presents the actual knowledge concerning the structure, source and biological function of sIL-2Ralpha in patients with haematological and non-haematological malignancies. The authors review the published data on clinical applicability of soluble IL-2Ralpha determination in terms of diagnostics, prognosis and treatment monitoring of particular types of malignant disorders both in adults and in children. They also provide an insight into the clinical usefulness of sLL-2Ralpha-blocking antibodies in patients with cancer, and in those who reject organ transplants, develop graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and are affected with autoimmune disorders.",

Neither the clinical activity of anti-PD-1 nor the incidence of an immunoresponsive tumor microenvironment has been described for GCTs. A patient initially diagnosed with melanoma via fine needle aspiration was treated with one dose of antibody to PD-1. A core needle biopsy was subsequently performed to acquire sufficient tissue for molecular analysis, which led to a change in diagnosis to metastatic embryonal carcinoma. The testicular GCT cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas was analyzed using a T-cell gene signature associated with benefit from immunotherapy. Primary tumors (N = 134) were categorized as high (T-cell-inflamed), medium, or low (non-T-cell-inflamed) by their T-cell signature derived from RNAseq data. Anti-PD-1 induced decreases in serum markers and a 33% reduction in tumor volume. Gene expression revealed a T-cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment in 47% of testicular GCTs, including seminoma (83%) and nonseminoma (17%) tumor subtypes. Expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) RNA correlated with lack of the T-cell signature, with increasing AFP RNA inversely correlating with the inflamed signature and expression of IFNγ-associated genes.

Three cell types, including chicken embryonic cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus, human malignant melanoma cell line LOX, and human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231, retain the invasive phenotype in vitro, express invadopodia, degrade and enter into a fibronectin-rich collagenous matrix. We suggest that invadopodium-associated proteases are ideal targets for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer as their presence in association with primary tumors may signal increased metastatic potential. An approach toward the development of new prognostic markers for breast malignancy involved production of monoclonal antibodies directed against membrane proteases in a mixture of glycoproteins. Double immunofluorescent technique using a known invadopodium marker is designed to select specific monoclonal antibodies colocalizing at the invasion front, on invadopodia of cancer cells. Membrane protease accessibility at the cell surface can therefore be exploited for therapeutic advances by the development of specific antibodies and inhibitors that block their activities, and by the use of monoclonal antibodies to target cytotoxic molecules to micrometastases. Also, this same accessibility may potentially be used to detect surface proteases on micrometastases or to detect components shed by micrometastases in serum.",

The time course of melphalan concentrations in perfusate and tissues during a 60-min melphalan perfusion and 30-min drug-free washout in the single-pass perfused rat hindlimb was examined using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model. The rat hindlimbs were perfused with Krebs-Heinseleit buffer containing 4.7% bovine serum albumin (BSA) or 2.8% dextran 40 at a constant rate of 3.8 ml/min. The concentration of melphalan in perfusate and tissues was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The tissue concentrations of melphalan were significantly higher with the perfusate containing dextran than BSA during the 60-min perfusion. During the washout period, the melphalan concentration in the perfusates decreased rapidly in first few minutes, followed by a slower monoexponential decline. The estimated half life (t1/2) for melphalan removal from skin and fat was 59 +/- 2 min for both BSA and dextran perfusates. However, the estimated t1/2 for melphalan removal from muscle was 79 and 96 min for BSA and dextran washout perfusates, respectively. The predicted concentration-time profiles obtained for melphalan with BSA and dextran perfusates appear to correspond closely to the observed data. This study showed that the uptake of melphalan into perfused tissues is impaired by the use of perfusates in which melphalan is highly bound. Melphalan washout from muscle, but not skin and fat, was facilitated by the use of perfusates in which melphalan is highly protein bound.",

Genetic association studies over databases offer an attractive starting point for gene discovery.;The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Phenome Genome Integrator (PheGenI) tool was enriched for pancreatic cancer-associated traits. The genes associated with the trait were characterized using diverse bioinformatics tools for Genome-Wide Association (GWA), transcriptome and proteome profile and protein classes for motif and domain.;Two hundred twenty-six genes were identified that had a genetic association with pancreatic cancer in the human genome. This included 25 uncharacterized open reading frames (ORFs). Bioinformatics analysis of these ORFs identified putative druggable proteins and biomarkers including enzymes, transporters and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling proteins. Secreted proteins including a neuroendocrine factor and a chemokine were identified. Five out of these ORFs encompassed non coding RNAs. The ORF protein expression was detected in numerous body fluids, such as ascites, bile, pancreatic juice, milk, plasma, serum and saliva. Transcriptome and proteome analyses showed a correlation of mRNA and protein expression for nine ORFs. Analysis of the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database revealed a strong correlation across copy number variations and mRNA over-expression for four ORFs. Mining of the International Cancer Gene Consortium (ICGC) database identified somatic mutations in a significant number of pancreatic patients' tumors for most of these ORFs. The pancreatic cancer-associated ORFs were also found to be genetically associated with other neoplasms, including leukemia, malignant melanoma, neuroblastoma and prostate carcinomas, as well as other unrelated diseases and disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Crohn's disease, coronary diseases, attention deficit disorder and addiction.;Based on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), copy number variations, somatic mutational status and correlation of gene expression in pancreatic tumors at the mRNA and protein level, expression specificity in normal tissues and detection in body fluids, six ORFs emerged as putative leads for pancreatic cancer. These six targets provide a basis for accelerated drug discovery and diagnostic marker development for pancreatic cancer.",

The effect of DPPE and verapamil on the intracellular concentration of daunorubicin in MDR+ cells was compared. For the clinical study, subjects with progressive malignancy received a weekly infusion of a maximally tolerated dose of DPPE (240 mg/m2) over 80 or 440 minutes, in conjunction with a single chemotherapy drug to which, in most cases, the patient's tumor was previously resistant.

In an effort to improve the tolerance and therapeutic effectiveness of this cytokine, we investigated the influence of giving a single dose of recombinant murine IL-12 (rmIL-12) a week prior to daily cytokine administration (predosing) on its toxic and antitumor effects. These studies were performed in C3H/HeN mice, in which a course of rmIL-12 at standard doses without predosing induced rejection of syngeneic K1735 melanomas in 33%, and in A/J mice, in which treatment induced rejection of syngeneic B7-1+ SCK (SCK.B7-1) mammary carcinomas in 63%. Administration of a predose of rmIL-12 markedly reduced cytokine toxicity in a dose-dependent manner and allowed safe administration of up to 8-fold higher doses of daily rmIL-12 in C3H/HeN mice and 4-fold higher doses of rmIL-12 in A/J mice. Predosing followed by either standard or high daily doses of rmIL-12 did not significantly alter most end points of rmIL-12 treatment of K1735 or SCK.B7-1 tumors (survival, death from tumor, development of protective immunity, and so on), but they appeared to attenuate early control of tumorigenesis by rmIL-12. Evidence for the latter comes from a shortening of the characteristic rmIL-12-induced delay in tumor appearance and in the frequent appearance of tumors that subsequently regress. However, higher doses appear to produce better therapeutic results than standard doses of rmIL-12 after predosing. Predosing severely blunted induction of serum IFN-gamma levels by rmIL-12, which probably accounts for many of the effects of predosing on rmIL-12 toxicity and efficacy. Thus, predosing desensitizes mice to the toxic effects of rIL-12 and allows much higher doses to be given but, despite this, it does not improve and, by some criteria, it attenuates rIL-12 therapeutic outcome. Our results do not support the use of predosing as a way to enhance the effectiveness of rIL-12 in cancer clinical trials.",

During studies of the chemistry of a gold complex of this group [(AuCl)2(DPPE)], it was observed that this complex readily underwent ring closure on reaction with DPPE to form the tetrahedral complex [Au(DPPE)2]+. Various counterion forms (e.g., Cl-) of this cation were isolated and were found to exhibit a remarkably high stability in solution. Evaluation of [Au(DPPE)2]Cl in mice bearing i.p. P388 leukemia demonstrated that the compound produced an average of 87% increase in life span at its maximally tolerated dose (2-3 mumol/kg/day for 5 days). Activity was also seen in i.p. M5076 reticulum cell sarcoma (60% increase in life span) and s.c. mammary adenocarcinoma 16/c. Modest activity was evident in i.p. B16 melanoma and L1210 leukemia. A subline of P388 leukemia resistant to cisplatin was not cross-resistant to [Au(DPPE)2]Cl. In addition, combination therapy of [Au(DPPE)2]Cl and cisplatin against i.p. P388 demonstrated an advantage over single-agent therapy. In vitro studies of [Au(DPPE)2]Cl showed that the compound: is cytotoxic to tumor cell lines; is only minimally inhibited in its cytotoxic activity by the presence of serum; produces DNA protein cross-links and DNA strand breaks in cells; and inhibits macromolecular synthesis with a preferential inhibitory effect on protein synthesis relative to DNA and RNA synthesis. 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that the compound is stable in the presence of serum proteins, thiols, or disulfides and that it reacts with Cu(II) resulting in the formation of a Cu(I)DPPE complex. The results of these in vivo and in vitro experiments suggest that the contrasting pharmacological profile of [Au(DPPE)2]Cl with respect to other gold(I) phosphine complexes may be related to both the kinetic stability of the complex and its stability in the presence of thiols.",

As a consequence, malignant cells are often less dependent on external growth factors and may be refractory to differentiation signals. Consistent with this view, we here show that 5 of 9 human bladder carcinoma cell lines (5637, HU549, SD, TCCSuP and T24) as well as a colon carcinoma line, HCT-8, and the melanoma line, HS294T, could be adapted to grow continuously in medium without serum or any other source of protein. The cells grown under these conditions displayed a longer generation time and were more dependent on a high initial cell concentration for survival and outgrowth. However, in most other respects, including cell morphology, growth pattern and antigenic phenotype, the cells were very similar to the original cultures. Conditioned medium from all the cell lines of bladder tumor origin as well as the HCT-8 colon carcinoma line was shown to contain autocrine growth stimulatory activity. Furthermore, criss-cross experiments showed that supernatants stimulated not only proliferation of the autologous cell line but also growth of the other cell lines, suggesting the production of a common autocrine factor/s in bladder tumor cells. Incubation of cells with radioiodinated supernatant allowed the identification of several candidate molecules for this factor activity. The study supports previous observations of autocrine stimulation as a mechanism for tumor cells to acquire autonomous growth capacity and indicates that this may be an important element in the oncogenesis of bladder tumors.",

The use of targeted therapies, especially tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), in specific groups of patients has dramatically improved the prognosis of this disease, although inevitably some patients will develop resistance to these drugs during active treatment. The most common cancer-associated acquired mutation is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Thr790Met (T790M) mutation. During active treatment with targeted therapies, histopathological transformation to small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) can occur in 3-15% of patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) tumors. By definition, SCLC is a high-grade tumor with specific histological and genetic characteristics. In the majority of cases, a good-quality hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain is enough to establish a diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is used to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other neoplasia such as sarcomatoid carcinomas, large-cell carcinoma, basaloid squamous-cell carcinoma, chronic inflammation, malignant melanoma, metastatic carcinoma, sarcoma, and lymphoma. A loss of the tumor-suppressor protein retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) is found in 100% of human SCLC tumors; therefore, it has an essential role in tumorigenesis and tumor development. Other genetic pathways probably involved in the histopathological transformation include neurogenic locus notch homolog (NOTCH) and achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1). Histological transformation to SCLC can be suspected in NSCLC patients who clinically deteriorate during active treatment. Biopsy of any new lesion in this clinical setting is highly recommended to rule out a SCLC transformation. New studies are trying to assess this histological transformation by noninvasive measures such as measuring the concentration of serum neuron-specific enolase. ",

As there were no metastases, external complementary radiotherapy was not used. Four months after surgery, a large recurrence was detected; surgical excision proved impossible but revealed a grossly pigmented tumor from which several samples were taken. The patient died 11 months after the first consultation. No autopsy was performed. Morphological study was done on the initial biopsy, on the uterine tumor and on the recurrent tumor, using histological, cytological, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical techniques. Flow cytometry and biochemical study were also carried out on the recurrent tumor. All the samples studied histologically revealed uniform tumor morphology showing a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with an irregular distribution of melanin pigmentation (Fontana +). Electron microscopy confirmed the epithelial nature of the tumor, showing differentiated apical poles with villosities, linked by desmosomes. Basement membranes were irregularly present. Electron microscopy also demonstrated the melanotic nature of the pigmentation with melanosomes and premelanosomes. A few membrane-bound neurosecretory granules were seen. Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor contains no S 100 protein and that no staining was obtained with monoclonal antibodies against malignant melanoma. Hormonal secretion and chromogranin were not detected. Tumor cells contained neither GFAP nor neurofilaments. Positive staining was obtained for neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin. Tumor cells contained three types of intermediate filament proteins = Vimentin, cytokeratins and peripherin (peripherin is an intermediate filament protein identified in 1984 by Portier, of the college of France, who very kindly supplied the antiserum and was good enough to do most of the biochemical study. Peripherin is considered to be characteristic of the peripheral nervous system. This case is the first example of demonstration of peripherin in a tumor). The biochemical study gave the following results: Cytosol assays for estrogen and progesterone receptors were negative. Vimentin, cytokeratins and peripherin were demonstrated by a study carried out in the Collège de France. No GFAP was found.

The human HT1080 fibrosarcoma and Bowe melanoma cells, which rapidly digest collagenous proteins in vitro, failed to dissolve them when cocultivated with bovine endothelial cells. This inhibition was not dependent on the ability of endothelial cells to form a monolayer separating the tumor cells from the collagenous substrate. In contrast, little collagenolysis inhibitory activity was detected in bovine vascular smooth muscle cells and human fibroblasts when compared to endothelial cells. Serum-free medium conditioned by endothelial cells inhibited tumor cell-mediated collagenolysis. Our data further suggest that this inhibition was mediated by secreted collagenase inhibitors, since endothelial cell-conditioned medium did not suppress the production of metalloproteinases by the tumor cells but inhibited the activities of collagenases derived from tadpole, rabbit, and human fibroblasts. Treatment of the endothelial cells with cycloheximide suppressed the collagenase inhibitory activity, demonstrating active production of collagenase inhibitors by the cells. Gel filtration chromatography of endothelial cell-conditioned medium allowed the separation of two distinct peaks with inhibitory activities for vertebrate collagenase in the molecular weight range of 70,000 to 75,000 and 30,000 to 35,000, respectively. While the inhibitor with an approximate molecular weight of 30,000 to 35,000 shared many properties with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, the high-molecular-weight inhibitor demonstrated characteristics not yet described for any collagenase inhibitor. The production and secretion of inhibitors of vertebrate collagenase by bovine endothelial cells may be of importance in the local control of collagen turnover under physiological as well as pathological conditions.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Betulinic acid is under development as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma. In support of pharmacokinetic and toxicological evaluations, a robust assay based on liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was developed for the quantitative analysis of betulinic acid. Sample preparation consisted of deproteinization of the plasma by the addition of three volumes of acetonitrile and one volume of methanol followed by centrifugation. Aliquots of the supernatant were analyzed using an isocratic reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system coupled to a negative ion electrospray mass spectrometer. Deprotonated molecules of betulinic acid and the isomeric internal standard oleanolic acid were detected using selected ion monitoring at m/z 455. The limit of detection of betulinic acid was 0.5 pg (1.1 fM) injected on-column (50 pg/mL, 10 microL injection volume), and the limit of quantitation was 2 pg (4.4 fM, 200 pg/mL, 10 microL injection volume). Betulinic acid was stable in plasma samples at -20 degrees C for at least 3 weeks. The intra-day and inter-day coefficients of variation of the assay were < or =6.4 and < or =9.0%, respectively. The utility of the assay was demonstrated by analyzing betulinic acid spiked into mouse, rat and dog plasma, by determining the extent of binding of betulinic acid to plasma proteins, and by measuring betulinic acid in mouse and rat plasma following intraperitoneal or intravenous administration in vivo. At 15 and 25 microg/mL in mouse, rat or dog plasma, betulinic acid was 99.99% bound to serum proteins, and, at 5 microg/mL, betulinic acid was > or =99.97% bound.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Xenogeneic immunization of freshly-prepared human glioma extracts into goats has yielded a polyclonal antiserum, which after multiple absorptions specifically identifies antigenic entities only in glioma extracts, and not in appropriate controls, both by radioimmunoassays (RIAs) and Western immunoblots. The results from the absorbed polyclonal antiserum have been confirmed by the successful generation of six stable murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which recognize a subset of the same antigens with high specificity on immunoblots and with no apparent cross-reactivities by RIA to normal brain, serum, liver, muscle, kidney, spleen, or melanoma tissues. Moreover, the tested murine MAbs (B12C4) reveal a striking and abundant glial filament protein, possibly related to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or other intermediate filament proteins, by frozen-section immunofluorescence. This is seen only in gliomas and is absent, or dramatically reduced, in normal human cortex. Use of potent immortalizing strain (FF41) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to establish antibody-secreting human lymphoblastoid lines, and the generation of mouse-human chimeric fusions, have yielded lines possessing variable supernatant human antibody secretion. Radioimmunoassays using culture supernatants, and sera from glioma patients and an normal individual, have demonstrated surprisingly similar reactivity profiles, even after a sensitive sandwich RIA employing the B6C6 murine MAb. These results suggest that, although human glioma-associated antigens, including possibly the up-regulation of GFAP expression, clearly exist, there seems to be a muted humoral response as evidenced by a paucity of tumor-specific B-cells. This may be due to antigenic shielding by the blood-brain barrier, or due to a form of immunological compromise in patients harboring these malignancies.",

NY-ESO-1 seropositivity was significantly positively associated with an active smoking history in patients with NSCLC but not in smokers from the control group. In tumors, the frequency of NY-ESO-1 mRNA expression was 6.3% (in four of 64 patients), the frequency of human epidermal growth factor 2/neu (HER 2/neu) expression was 11.9% (five of 42), and the frequency of MAGE-A4 expression was 35.1% (20 of 57). MAGE-A4 expression in tumors correlated with smoking status and male sex in patients with NSCLC. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma displayed higher expression of NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A4 in tumors than did patients with adenocarcinoma. On the other hand, 94.7% of nonsmoking patients in our study had adenocarcinoma (of whom 73.7% were women).;These results confirm the reported high immunogenicity of NY-ESO-1 and suggest that a smoking-induced chronic inflammatory state might potentiate the development of NY-ESO-1-specific immune responses. Moreover, smoking might contribute to the expression of other cancer/testis antigens such as MAGE-A4 at early stages of NSCLC development.",

Twenty-seven patients with metastatic cancer were treated with escalating doses of s(CHO) IL-1R at 1, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 55 mg/m2 i.v. on days -6 (except cohort 2), 1, and 15 and IL-2 at doses of 300,000 IU/kg (cohort 1) and 600,000 IU/kg (cohorts 2-7) i.v. every 8 h on days 1-5 and 15-19. No toxicity directly attributable to s(CHO) IL-1R was observed. The median number of IL-2 doses was 23. Hypotension and neurotoxicity were the major dose-limiting toxicities for the IL-2/s(CHO) IL-1R combination. Of the 24 patients treated with full-dose IL-2, there were six responses, three complete and three partial (response rate, 25%). Three patients developed thyroid dysfunction, and all 3 responding melanoma patients exhibited vitiligo. The t1/2 of s(CHO) IL-1R alone was 24-30 h and was not significantly altered by coadministration with IL-2. Whole-blood functional assays indicated that sufficient s(CHO) IL-1R was present in the circulation at top dose levels to inhibit the in vitro effects of IL-1beta on IL-8 induction; however, no effect on IL-2-induced IL-8 induction, or on the IL-1beta- or IL-2-induced tumor necrosis factor production, was observed. Suppression of IL-2-mediated tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-6 induction in vivo during the first 24 h after IL-2 administration was observed, and the neutrophil chemotactic defect normally seen with IL-2 was not observed. IL-1R antagonist induction far exceeded that seen previously with IL-2 alone. No inhibition of either serum C-reactive protein induction or enhanced urinary nitrate excretion and no consistent effect on IL-2-related changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell phenotype or endothelial adhesion molecule expression were seen. The coadministration of s(CHO) IL-1R produced no apparent reduction in IL-2 clinical toxicity manifested by either the ability to administer more IL-2 than anticipated or a reduction in the toxicity associated with a given amount of IL-2. Therefore, no effective biological dose could be identified for the s(CHO) IL-1R.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) can be defined as remote effects of cancer that are not caused by the tumor and its metastasis, or by infection, ischemia or metabolic disruptions. PNS are rare, affecting less than 1/10,000 patients with cancer. Only the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is relatively frequent, occurring in about 1% of patients with small cell lung cancer. PNS can affect any part of the central and peripheral nervous system, the neuromuscular junction, and muscle. They can be isolated or occur in association. In most patients, the neurological disorder develops before the cancer becomes clinically overt and the patient is referred to the neurologist who has the charge of identifying a neurological disorder as paraneoplastic. PNS are usually severely disabling. The most common PNS are Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), subacute cerebellar ataxia, limbic encephalitis (LE), opsoclonus-myoclonus (OM), retinopathies (cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR) and melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR), Stiff-Person syndrome (SPS), chronic gastrointestinal pseudoobstruction (CGP), sensory neuronopathy (SSN), encephalomyelitis (EM) and dermatomyositis. PNS are caused by autoimmune processes triggered by the cancer and directed against antigens common to both the cancer and the nervous system, designated as onconeural antigens. Due to their high specificity (> 90%), the best way to diagnose a neurological disorder as paraneoplastic is to identify one of the well-characterized anti-onconeural protein antibodies in the patient's serum. In addition, as these antibodies are associated with a restricted range of cancers, they can guide the search for the underlying tumor at a stage when it is frequently not clinically overt. This is a critical point as, to date, the best way to stabilize PNS is to treat the cancer as soon as possible. Unfortunately, about one-third of patients do not have detectable antibodies and 5% to 10% have an atypical antibody that is not well-characterized. As PNS are believed to be immune-mediated, suppression of the immune response represents another treatment approach.",
