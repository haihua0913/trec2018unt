Thus, investigation of mechanisms involved in metastasis is essential to control this tumor. However, the angiogenesis regulators that are biologically relevant for melanoma are still unknown. We have previously reported that high levels of soluble VEGF in metastatic malignant melanoma (MMM) patients may represent a useful biomarker to predict the effect of biochemotherapy in terms of clinical response. In this study, we evaluate whether soluble levels of angiogenin, transforming growth factor-1 and VEGFR-1 and -2 play a role in metastatic malignant melanoma patients and to determine if they have any relationship with clinicopathological parameters. Methods', ' Using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, angiogenin TGF-1, VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 were measured in sera of 70 patients with a fully documented history of metastatic malignant melanoma in comparison with 30 healthy controls. Results', ' Pretreatment circulating angiogenin, TGF- 1 VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 were detectable, variable in all samples from either melanoma patients or healthy donors Only serum transforming growth factor- 1 levels was significantly higher (p=0.005) in patients compared to healthy controls. No relationship was observed between sex, age or LDH level and all studied parameters. When tumor burden has been taken into consideration, a significant relationship was established between high circulating serum TGF-1 (p= 0.001) levels and tumor burden were found, Similarly, higher serum VEGFR1 levels were correlated with tumor burden (P = 0.02). Conclusions', ' The presence of high circulating TGF-1 and VEGF-R1 in metastatic malignant melanoma patients may prospectively identify high-risk patients with a worse prognosis.

CAVATAK is a novel bio-selected formulation of CVA21, which displays potent oncolytic activity against in vitro cultures of cancer cells and in vivo xenografts of a number of cancers. In addition, in vivo tumor challenge studies in immune-competent mouse models have shown that CVA21 lysed tumor cells can induce a secondary systemic host-generated anti-tumor immune response. In this report, advanced melanoma patients were administered multiple intralesional injections of CAVATAK and monitored for markers of host anti-tumor activity on metastatic non-injected lesions.Methods', ' The Phase II CALM (CAVATAK in Late stage Melanoma) study is investigating the efficacy and safety of intratumoral CAVATAK in 54 advanced melanoma patients.

CAVATAK-mediated immune anti-tumor activity was assessed by monitoring reductions in non-injected lesions (CT-scan and callipers) and assessing the relative serum levels of a panel of immune inflammatory cytokines. In addition, levels of serum CAVATAK and anti-CAVATAK neutralizing antibodies were assessed on multiple occasions prior to intralesional injections.Results', ' Intralesional CAVATAK injections resulted in significant responses in a number of melanoma lesions. However, in addition to melanoma tumor responses directly from CAVATAK-mediated oncolysis, a number of non-injected metatastic lesions displayed significant reductions or even complete destruction. Such anti-tumor activity in non-injected lesions is highly suggestive of being mediated via a host generated anti-tumor immune response. Such responses have occurred at times when no circulating infectious CAVATAK was detected in patient serum and in an environment of high levels of anti-CAVATAK neutralizing antibody. In further support of the generation of CAVATAK-mediated immune anti-tumor activity is the identification a possible novel serum cytokine signature of elevated levels of IL-8 and -IFN in treated patients linked to systemic tumor response. IL-8 is known to be secreted by activated macrophages, while -IFN is produced by stimulated cytotoxic T-cells / NK cells.Conclusion', ' With a number of patients in the Phase II CALM study displaying reductions in non-injected lesions, together with elevated serum levels of the immune inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and -IFN, at times with no detectable levels of circulating infectious CAVATAK, we conclude the generation of a targeted CAVATAK-mediated host anti-tumor response acting on metastatic melanoma lesions is highly likely.

These proteins were shown to be elevated in supernatants of an independent panel of high autophagy melanoma cell lines compared with low autophagy cells, suggesting a mechanistic link between autophagy level and secretion of these proteins. In addition, secretion of these proteins increased when melanoma cells with intrinsically low autophagy levels were treated with an autophagy-inducing tat-Beclin 1 peptide. Further supporting a mechanistic link, Atg7 silencing in an intrinsically high autophagy cell line resulted in significantly decreased secretion. Finally, serum collected from untreated metastatic melanoma patients with high tumor autophagy levels exhibited higher levels of these proteins than serum from low autophagy patients.

In the current study, melanoma cells with high autophagy and the BRAF V600E mutation (1205Lu) were treated with the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720, the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), PLX4720+HCQ, and the autophagy inducer rapamycin. The increase in autophagic flux upon the addition of PLX4720 or rapamycin was confirmed by western blotting and tandem fluorescently tagged LC3 (mCherry-eGFP-LC3). Secretomes were compared using quantitative proteomics, which resulted in identification of 1154 proteins with a false discovery rate of less than 1%. Hierarchical clustering and principal components analysis showed that secretomes from cells treated with the autophagy inducers rapamycin or PLX4720 correlated more closely with each other than those treated with HCQ either alone or in combination. A panel of proteins involved in extracellular matrix modification, cell-cell adhesion, and inflammation (including FAM3C and LIF) significantly increased in the supernatants of cells treated with PLX4720 or rapamycin and decreased in supernatants from cells treated with HCQ or HCQ+PLX4720. These results demonstrate that autophagy plays an active role in modifying the molecular composition of the tumor secretome. Proteins specifically shed in response to BRAF inhibitors and/or autophagy inhibition may have utility in the clinic for diagnostic and pharmacodynamic applications.']",

        "Background":"['Establishing the mechanism by which S100B affects ERK and its downstream signaling provided insight into how S100B affects the progression of malignant melanoma and could aid in developing new pharmacological drugs. S100B is a 21.5 kDa symmetric homodimer that is highly conserved and expressed in a number of tissues and cell lines, including melanocytes. Generally, low levels of S100B have trophic effects, while higher levels can have dire consequences, as is the case in human malignant melanoma. S100B is an effective and widely used prognostic marker for malignant melanoma, with its increased level in serum being predictive of disease stage, increased recurrence, and low overall survival. More recently, S100B has been investigated as a potential contributor to cancer progression, which may be related to how it impacts cell signaling, including the MAPK pathway (BRAF-MEK-ERK). To further evaluate its significance, S100B knock-down clones were created from the WM115 melanoma cell line, and a positive correlation was found between S100B expression and cell viability, as measured by MTT assays. It was also discovered that cells with suppressed S100B expression showed significantly lower levels of ERK phosphorylation. Likewise, over-expression of S100B in the human melanoma cell line, 501-MEL, showed the reciprocal effect, with the introduction of high levels of S100B leading to increased cell viability and ERK phosphorylation. However, the phosphorylation status of ERK does not translate to all of its downstream targets. For example, increased RSK phosphorylation was observed in the S100B knock-down clones, and correspondingly, RSK phosphorylation was decreased with over-expression of S100B. Additionally, over-expression of a mutant S100B construct (E31A + E72A) that was incapable of binding calcium yielded neither effect, indicating that the effect of S100B on RSK phosphorylation was calcium-dependent. To determine if S100B interacted directly with RSK, pull-down assays were performed next. Consistent with the calcium-mutant data, RSK was detected in S100B pull-downs in the presence of calcium, but not in the presence of the calcium chelator EDTA. Changes in RSK localization was also observed, where RSK was enriched in the nucleus of WM115 cells when S100B was knocked down and diffuse in control cells. Together these data are consistent with a mechanism in which elevated S100B binds directly to RSK, preventing its phosphorylation by ERK and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus. Thus, the calcium-binding protein S100B affects MAPK signaling by increasing levels of phosphorylated ERK while simultaneously decreasing phosphorylated RSK. Together, these two effects of S100B on MAPK signaling could impact cancer progression.']",

RNAseq and immunohistochemical analysis ofCDH19 in human samples confirmed its over-expression in >60% of melanoma, whereas normal expression primarily occurred in tissues derived from the neural crest such as nerve fibers and autonomic ganglia. CD3 based bi-specific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) were used to determine if redirected lysis of T-cells against CDH19 would drive anti-tumor efficacy. In vitro, the CDH19 BiTEs were high affinity binders to both human and cyno CDH19, and were able to induce specific T-cell activation and cytotoxicity against a panel of melanoma cell lines. In addition, soluble CDH19 levels were detected in human serum and the effects of BiTE cytotoxicity toward melanoma cells in the presence of soluble CDH19 was investigated. In vivo studies were conducted to confirm the specificity and activity of CDH19 BiTEs in xenograft models of melanoma. The CDH19 BiTE AMG-CDH19X was able to cause tumor growth inhibition in models expressing as few as 250 receptors per cell, and inhibition of tumor growth was enhanced by the addition of a blocking antibody against PD-L1. Immunohistochemical analysis of post-treatment xenograft samples suggested that anti-PD-L1 the persistence of tumor reactive T cells, and provided rationale for combining a BiTE against CDH19 with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in melanoma. In summary, targeting CDH19 presents a promising novel opportunity for BiTEs in the treatment of melanoma, both alone and in combination with current standard of care.']",

        "Background":"['New effective therapies are greatly needed for uveal melanoma, the most common ocular malignancy, which has a very poor prognosis with a median survival of less than one year when metastatic disease develops. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is expressed in 94% of uveal melanomas but is not expressed in normal tissues of concern for toxicity. Previously, we developed an MC1R specific ligand (MC1RL) with high affinity and selectivity for MC1R. We used the MC1RL as a targeting scaffold for development of a radiopharmaceutical by conjugation of 225Ac chelate to form 225Ac -MC1RL-DOTA. 225Ac is a therapeutic alpha-emitting radionuclide. 225Ac -MC1RL-DOTA was synthesized with high radiochemical yield and purity (>95 and >99 % respectively) with an excellent in vitro stability, i.e. 90% after 10 days in human serum at 37ºC. An MTT cytotoxicity study demonstrated MC1R specific antiproliferative effect in cutaneous, ocular and uveal melanoma cell lines. A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) study was completed, where a range of 0-148 kBq (0-4 µCi) of 225Ac -MC1RL-DOTA was administered to groups of BALB/c mice. The radiopharmaceutical was well tolerated at even the highest doses and animals did not reach any clinical endpoints, such as weight loss, loss of kidney function or abnormal pathology. Biodistribution studies on MC1R expressing tumor bearing mice revealed tumor selectivity and a combination of renal and hepatic clearance with minimal retention in other normal tissues. A blood PK study in rats showed rapid clearance of the agent from the blood in <60 min. To determine radiodosimetry, gamma spectra were acquired for tumors, blood and other tissues and organs over a 21-day time period and activity curves generated for each tissue for 225Ac and other gamma-emitting daughter products in the decay chain. An exponential line-fitting of these curves allowed the estimation of clearance kinetics, tissue biological half-life and total absorbed dose (Gy) for each tissue. Doses were highest in MC1R positive tumors and clearance organs (liver, kidney and spleen) and low in all other tissues. In vivo efficacy studies were performed in human A375/MC1R cutaneous and MEL20 uveal melanoma tumors in SCID mice, or syngeneic mouse B16 melanoma tumors in C57BL/6 mice (n=10/group) injected with either 225Ac -MC1RL-DOTA, 225Ac-scrambled-MC1RL-DOTA, La-MC1RL-DOTA (non-radioactive control agent) or saline. In every case a tumor growth delay was observed in treated mice relative to controls, and a percentage of mice bearing the human tumors had complete remission. In conclusion, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo properties of 225Ac-MC1RL-DOTA in this study. This agent demonstrated a significant MC1R-specific in vivo therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model of uveal melanoma with low systemic toxicity.']",

Median duration of response was 33 mos, being significantly longer in M1a than in M1c (44 versus 28 mos). Median PFS was 32.5 mos; median OS was not reached. All pts experienced at least 1 adverse event (AE); the AEs were moderate or severe in 22% of cases. 19 pts underwent dose reduction, but no discontinuation due to AEs was observed.

The same pts after 1 mo of tx showed lower plasma levels of CCL2, a marker of acquired resistance to Vb. Conclusions', ' Vb can induce LTRs in a subset of pts with mm also in presence of unfavorable prognostic factors, though M1a pts are more likely to obtain prolonged benefit.

Hence, new targeted therapies are needed. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is expressed in 94% of uveal melanomas but is not expressed in normal tissues of concern for toxicity. We have developed a MC1R specific ligand (MC1RL), conjugated imaging contrast agents to it, demonstrated high selectivity for MC1R expressing tumors in mice, and demonstrated rapid systemic clearance, without retention in tissues of concern for toxicity. The aim of this study is to use MC1RL as a targeting scaffold for development of a radiopharmaceutical by conjugation of 225Ac chelate. 225Ac is a therapeutic alpha emitting radionuclide. A targeted approach to deliver 225Ac to uveal melanoma without causing toxicity in normal tissues would provide clinicians with a novel and powerful therapeutic option for treatment of metastatic disease.Here, we conjugated 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclo-dodecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) to the MC1R specific scaffold (DOTA-MC1RL) and chelated the nonradioactive surrogate 139La (substitute for 225Ac) and demonstrated high binding affinity to MC1R (0.2 nM Ki). We anticipate that the radioactive conjugates will have comparable affinities. We also synthesized 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL and showed a radiochemical yield greater than 95% and high radiochemical purity (99.8%) as determined by radio-TLC, radio-HPLC, and gamma-counter quantification. Moreover, 225Ac -DOTA-MC1RL showed excellent in vitro stability, i.e. 90% after 10 days in human serum at 37C.

Animals were followed for 120 days and there were no signs of altered behavior among the groups. The group that received the highest dosage had a slightly but significantly lower increase in body weight over the course of the study, suggesting that 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL is tolerated extremely well. Blood work and organ pathology did not show any significant deleterious effects even at the highest dose.

        "Background":"['DNA copy number variation (CNV) has been identified in many cancers. Recent studies have shown that CNV data, in combination with other high-throughput techniques, can provide novel biological insight to tumor biology. Although a number of CNV whole-genome studies have been performed on melanoma using cell lines and frozen tumors, very few have used formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE)-derived material. Melanoma tumors are small and rarely frozen, which means that FFPE tumor blocks would be a very valuable source of genomic material to be used for CNV analysis if the methodologies were adequately developed. It has been shown that reliable next generation sequencing data can be produced from FFPE-derived DNA in lung cancers (Wood et al., 2010). Here, we report a study showing that DNA from FFPE melanoma tumor blocks can be used for CNV detection on a next generation sequencing platform. DNA from 20 FFPE melanoma samples was used to prepare genomic libraries, which were sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx instrument. Successful library preparation occurred at DNA levels of at least 30ng, while current protocols generally suggest 50ng with high quality material and 1g generally. The use of SPRIworks (Beckman Coulter) and Bravo (Agilent) robots was compared with the manual method for library preparation with input DNA mass of 30-150ng. Libraries prepared manually were always of better quality and yield. We also investigated means of improving library preparation. Melanin co-purifies with DNA and inhibits downstream reactions, and indeed lower coverage was seen in our samples if they were heavily pigmented. To overcome the adverse effects of melanin, 10 DNA samples (5 pairs) were used for library preparation with and without bovine serum albumin (BSA). BSA has been shown to bind to melanin, and as a result the melanin does not inhibit the DNA polymerase reaction. All 5 libraries with BSA were of higher quality and yield when compared to those prepared without BSA. All comparisons were made after running the libraries on an Agilent DNA chip.Currently available data from the GAIIx were used to develop the analysis pipeline. The first 10 samples were multiplexed together and run twice, while the remaining 10 were multiplexed at 5 samples per lane and run once. The average coverage obtained was 0.10x with a range of 0.03x-0.11x. We observed a strong effect on mapping quality based upon the end-cycle quality scores, leading us to adopt an aggressive data trimming procedure. More samples from the Leeds Melanoma Cohort will soon be prepared and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument. We aim to identify if tumors with driver BRAF mutations have different genomic signatures when compared to those with NRAS mutations. Finally, genomic data will be combined with clinical data and we will check for the prognostic significance of CNV changes identified in our samples.']",

Recently, we have reported substantial overexpression of Nox5 in several human cancers including those of prostate, ovary and melanomas; expression in most non-malignant tissues was weak to modest. Despite being upregulated in many human cancers and implicated in promoting cell proliferation, the molecular mechanisms regulated by Nox5 are poorly understood. In this study, the functional significance of Nox5 was assessed in human UACC-257 melanoma cells by generating stable Nox5-overexpressing clones and knockdown clones. Overexpression of Nox5 in UACC-257 cells resulted in enhanced cell growth, increased BrdU positive cells and decreased phosphatase activity. Additionally, these cells had increased normoxic Hif-1 expression and decreased p27Kip1 expression. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous Nox5 in UACC-257 cells resulted in decreased cell growth, decreased BrdU positive cells, decreased Hif-1 expression and increased p27Kip1 expression. Cadherin switch, loss of E-cadherin expression and upregulation of N-cadherin was observed in Nox5 overexpressing cells indicative of an invasive phenotype; conversely, an upregulation of E-cadherin expression in Nox5 knockdown cells was noted. Cell invasion assay through matrigel-coated membranes also demonstrated enhanced invasion by Nox5 overexpressing cells. Additionally, 3D cultures of Nox5 overexpressing cells exhibit an amoeboid morphology compared to that of the Nox5 knockdown cells that were mesenchymal, suggestive of an amoeboid - mesenchymal (AMT) transition. Strikingly, cells that overexpress Nox5 were able to proliferate in serum-free conditions for over a month. In summary, our findings suggest that Nox5 expression in human melanoma UACC-257 cells could contribute to cell proliferation, invasion, amoeboid morphology, and the ability to grow in the absence of serum or growth factors in part due to the generation of high local concentrations of extracellular ROS that modulate multiple signaling networks that regulate Hif-1, p27Kip1, and the cadherin switch.']",

AM0010 alone has established tolerability and anti-tumor activity in a phase 1 study. Objective responses were observed in 4 of 15 pts with RCC, one patient with uveal melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma, each. Methods', ' 25 melanoma pts who had progressed on prior anti-CTLA4 and on prior anti-PD-1 containing regimen were treated with AM0010 (20mg/kg qd, SQ) and pembrolizumab (2mg/kg, q3wk IV). Patients had a median of 3.5 prior therapies (range 2-6) and a median of 2 prior immune therapies (range 1-6). Tumor responses were monitored following irRC. Immune responses were measured by analysis of serum cytokines, activation of blood derived T cells and peripheral T cell clonality. Results', ' AM0010 plus pembrolizumab was well tolerated. All treatment related adverse events (TrAE) were reversible. DLTs and SAEs leading to study discontinuation were not observed. G3/4 TrAEs were observed in 11 of 25 pts and included fatigue (8) thrombocytopenia (6), anemia (4), rash (1) and hypertriglyceridemia (1). There were no objective tumor responses. 9 of 20 evaluable pts had stable disease (DCR = 45%). As of Jan. 31 2017, the mPFS was 2.0 mo. and the mOS was not reached, with a mFU of 15.5 mos (range 10.0-18.4). AM0010 plus pembrolizumab increased Th1 cytokines as well as the number and proliferation of PD1+ Lag3+ activated CD8 T cells in the blood while reducing inflammatory cytokines and TGFb. A de-novo oligoclonal expansion of T cell clones in the blood and an increase of tumor infiltrating Granzyme+ PD1+ CD8+ T cells in tumor biopsies of treated patients was observed. Conclusions', ' AM0010 in combination with anti-PD1 is well-tolerated in refractory melanoma pts. The clinical activity and the observed CD8+ T cell activation may suggest to study AM0010 in combination with an anti-PD-1 in melanoma patients with less prior treatments.

        "Background":"['Melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, has a high incidence of forming metastases with a poor prognosis and median survival of less than 12 months. Tumor metastasis depends on cell interaction with vascular endothelial cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) regulated by adhesion molecules such as integrin transmembrane receptors. Integrin v (vitronectin receptor) has been implicated in the metastatic cascade of many cancers, and blocking v integrin with intetumumab (fully humanized monoclonal antibody) decreases the formation of breast cancer brain metastases and inhibited human melanoma tumor growth in a rat xenograft model. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that v integrins are crucial for the cell migration and invasion characteristics of melanoma cells that are involved in metastasis. Human A2058 melanoma cells pretreated with hexadimethrine bromide were transduced with lentiviral clones of anti-v integrin shRNAs. Stable cell lines were selected with puromycin showing 75% knockdown (A2058-75KD) or 40% knockdown (A2058-40KD) of the v-integrin protein as determined with western blotting. Using the Cell Titer-Glo luminescence cell viability assay, we determined that the A2058-75KD cells have a 60% decreased rate of proliferation compared to control cells, and grow as large cell aggregates in suspension unlike adherent monolayer of control cells. The A2058-75KD cells demonstrate an ECM-dependent growth pattern. In a 3-dimensional matrix of Matrigel, the cell clumps dissociate and grow as infiltrating single cells, however, after harvesting from the Matrigel, cells revert back to non-adherent suspension clumps under 2-dimensional culture conditions. In comparison, the A2058-40KD cells with 40% v integrin knockdown showed no difference in the rate of proliferation compared to control cells and also grow as adherent monolayer under standard culture conditions. A transwell invasion assay was performed to assess migration through a barrier of Matrigel (2mg/ml) ECM for 72h using 10% fetal bovine serum media as the chemoattractant. A2058-40KD cells showed 50% decreased invasion compared to control cells. Using an ibidi 2-dimensional cell migration assay, we found that A2058-40KD cells showed markedly reduced migration at 6 days after plating, which was significantly reduced compared to control A2058 cells. Blocking v integrin with intetumumab decreased the migration of the control A2058 cells. Further experiments are underway to investigate the effect of v integrin knockdown on cell adhesion under dynamic fluid flow conditions and the specific  integrins involved in v-mediated effects in melanoma. We conclude that v integrins play a crucial role in the invasiveness of metastatic melanoma cells.']",

Difficulties were linked to the strong impact that many, if not all, pre- and post- analytical variables (i.e. tissue preparation, storage condition, extraction method, quantification technique, normalization approach) have on the final result.In this study, we used currently available high-throughput technologies to identify miRNAs present in plasma and serum of patients with breast, colorectal, lung and melanoma tumors, and healthy controls.

The conventional pathological assessment of the tumor is to date the better pronostic factor. Non invasive biomarkers are needed to assess the aggressivity of the tumor. Many serum biomarkers were assessed in melanoma, but due their low sensitivity and reduced specificity, their clinical significance remains a matter of debate.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non small coding RNAs with regulatroy roles on gene expression which are involved in a broad spectrum of physiological and pathological processes. The miRNAs have been described to circulate in highly stable, cell-free forms in blood and to have potential of useful non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of therapeutic response in cancer.Initially we performed a miRNA array (576 human miRNAs) using plasma samples from metastatic melanoma patients and healthy controls. 25 miRNAs upregulated were selected for further analysis along with 21 miRNAs described in litterature to be dysregulated in melanoma cells and tissues. We screened expression of these miRNAs in plasma samples of a training cohort (16 controls and 29 metastatic melanoma patients) using the BioMark 96.96 Dynamic Array (Fluidigm Corporation) for real-time qPCR was used to simultaneously test up to 96 samples against 96 microRNAs primers in a single experiment at nanoliter scale. Then miRNAs of interest were then validated in an independent cohort of 43 controls and 31 patients. After these processes, 5 miRNAs (Let-7b, miR-20a, miR-185, miR-338 and mir-1246) displayed significantly different expression levels in melanoma compared with controls. These miRNas had high sensitivity and specificity but the combination of miR-185 and miR-1246 was extremely more sensitive (90.5%) and specific (89.1%) than each individual miRNA to accurately discern patients and healthy donors. Moreover among these miRNAs, we observed that miR-185 expression is associated with a significant increase in survival and may have a protective effect, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.43, showing that miR-185 level could serve as an important marker for predicting the survival rate independently of other clinical and pathological factors.All our results showed that co-detection of miR-185 and miR-1246 profile in the plasma may be used as a biomarker for monitoring of patients with high recurrence-risk melanoma.

Several studies have correlated a negative prognosis in cancer with a high level of IL-6 in patient serum. Triple (i.e. progesterone, human epidermal growth factor-2, and estrogen receptor) negative breast cancer has been reported to be highly aggressive and invasive. MDA-MB-231, a triple negative breast cancer cell line, expresses high basal levels of IL-6. Recently our laboratory demonstrated that phenylmethimazole (C10), a novel toll-like receptor inhibitor, diminishes basal expression of IL-6 in pancreatic cancer and melanoma cells as well as their growth and migration. Based on these observations, we sought to test the hypothesis that C10 inhibits IL-6 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here we report that triple negative breast cancer cells express considerably higher levels of IL-6 than estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells and that C10 significantly reduces IL-6 expression in the triple negative breast cancer cells. This inhibition was observed at both the RNA and protein level. Given the importance of IL-6 in cancer progression, and our finding that C10 attenuates IL-6 expression in the MDA-MB-231 cell line, this study suggests that C10 may have therapeutic potential for triple negative breast cancers.

The engineered TCR portion of the drug targets and binds the gp100 peptide 280-288 antigen, which is over-expressed and presented by HLA-A2 on the surface of melanoma cells. The anti-CD3 scFv portion captures and redirects T cells to kill the melanoma cells, while normal antigen negative tissues are unaffected. Here, we present data which provides the foundation for the clinical observations. In vitro, IMCgp100 is demonstrated to potently redirect T cells from late stage cancer patients to target melanoma tumors exhibiting HLA-down regulation, even in the presence of high numbers of regulatory T cells. Target cell killing is observed within hours and is specific for gp100. In addition killing is associated with the release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as cross-presentation of gp100 and other melanoma-associated antigens by dendritic cells. Thus, IMCgp100 demonstrates the potential to elicit potent short-term responses and trigger longer-term anti melanoma activity in vivo.IMCgp100 is undergoing Phase I clinical testing in patients with advanced malignant melanoma; with the maximum tolerated dose having been established. The drug is well tolerated with evidence of tumor shrinkage. Analyses of serum samples obtained from patients on the trial demonstrate T cell mobilisation and transient drug mediated increases in various cytokines and chemokines, some of which are reported to play a key role in anti-melanoma responses.

An intertissue flow of GSH, where the liver is the main reservoir, increases GSH content in metastatic cells and promote their growth. We studied possible tumor-derived molecular signals that could activate GSH release from hepatocytes. GSH efflux increases in hepatocytes isolated from mice bearing liver or lung metastases, thus suggesting a systemic mechanism. Fractionation of serum-free conditioned medium from cultured B16-F10 cells and monoclonal antibody-induced neutralization techniques facilitated identification of interleukin (IL)-6 as a tumor-derived molecule promoting GSH efflux in hepatocytes. IL-6 activates GSH release through a methionine-sensitive/organic anion transporter polypeptide 1- and multidrug resistance protein 1-independent channel located on the sinusoidal site of hepatocytes. Specific siRNAs were used to knock down key factors in the main signaling pathways activated by IL-6, which revealed a STAT3-dependent mechanism. Our results show that IL-6 (mainly of tumor origin) facilitates GSH release from hepatocytes and its interorgan transport to metastatic growing foci. Metastatic tumor activated the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, thus increasing expression of hypothalamic corticotropin releasing factor and plasma levels of adrenocorticotropin hormone, corticosterone, and cathecolamines. Corticosterone and norepinephrine increased IL-6 expression and synthesis in metastatic cells, thus promoting the interorgan GSH/IL-6 cycling activity.

We and others have shown that malignant tumor cells can shed MICA/B to down regulate NKG2D expression and negatively impact NK and CD8 T cell function in cancer patients. Increased tumor-specific shedding of cell surface NKG2D ligand, MHC I chain related molecule (MIC), is associated with advanced stage and metastasis in many types of epithelial cancer. High serum levels of soluble MIC (sMIC) insults the immune system not only by down-regulating NKG2D expression on natural killer (NK) cells and effector T cells but also perturbing NK cell peripheral maintenance. Whether sMIC is an effective cancer therapeutic target has not been addressed due to the lack of specific sMIC-blocking reagent and clinically relevant pre-clinical animal models. Using a humanized clinically relevant spontaneous prostate carcinoma TRAMP/MIC bi-transgenic mouse model and multiple engineered syngeneic transplantable tumor models, we unprecedentedly show that therapy with a sMIC-specific monoclonal antibody induced rapid regression of primary tumors and metastasis without systemic toxicity. The therapy revamped a myriad of anti-tumor immune responses including NK cell homeostatic renewal and function, CD4 T cells to Th1 and Th17 responses. Using the well-defined melanoma model, we further show that anti-sMIC therapy augments Pmel-1 antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses. Notably, depletion of NK cells mitigated the therapeutic effect of anti-sMIC antibody and the effector function of both CD4 and CD8 T cells.

HGF-c-Met signaling is involved in a wide variety of human malignancies including colon, gastric, bladder, breast, ovarian, pancreatic, kidney, liver, lung, head and neck, thyroid, and prostate cancers, as well as sarcomas, hematological malignancies, melanoma and central nervous system tumors. In recent years, multiple agents have been developed directed to interfere at different levels in the HGF-c-Met signaling pathway, and some are currently being tested in Phase II and/or III clinical trials.Nanobodies are therapeutic proteins based on the smallest functional fragments of heavy chain antibodies, occurring in the Camelidae family. Importantly, they retain the full antigen-binding capacity of the original heavy chain only antibodies and are highly stable. In this study, we examined the anti-cancer effects of an anti-c-Met Nanobody in vitro using human multiple myeloma as a model system. The anti-c-Met Nanobody comprises of two Nanobody moieties, one targeting c-Met and one binding to human serum albumin for half-life extension. HGF is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma in different ways, as HGF is a pivotal growth and pro-migratory factor and inhibits osteoblastogenesis in vitro suggesting that HGF may contribute to the development of myeloma bone disease. Elevated levels of HGF in serum of multiple myeloma patients are correlated with a poor prognosis.We show that the anti-c-Met Nanobody effectively inhibited the proliferation of ANBL-6 human multiple myeloma cells via inhibition of an HGF autocrine growth loop, as well as the proliferation of INA-6 cells induced by exogenously added HGF. In addition, the HGF-induced migration of INA-6 cells was completely and specifically blocked following treatment with the Nanobody at a concentration of 1 M. The Nanobody also inhibited the HGF-induced adhesion of multiple myeloma cells to fibronectin, but did not affect stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha-induced adhesion. Furthermore, the Nanobody abolished the inhibiting effect of HGF on bone morphogenetic protein-2-induced ALP-activity and the mineralization of human mesenchymal stem cells. Finally, we show that the Nanobody reduced the HGF mediated phosphorylation of the c-Met Tyrosine (Y) residues Y1349, Y1234/1235 and Y1003 and the phosphorylation of the downstream proteins MAPK and Akt in INA-6 cells.In conclusion, the anti-c-Met Nanobody inhibited c-Met signaling with high specificity and potency resulting in inhibition of multiple myeloma cell migration, proliferation and adhesion, and in blocking of the HGF mediated inhibition of osteoblastogenesis. Given the potential of Nanobodies to surpass drawbacks of antibodies, this anti-c-Met Nanobody might represent a potential novel therapeutic agent in the treatment of multiple myeloma and other cancers driven by HGF-c-Met signaling.']",

The tumor and its microenvironment, produce cascades of information that enrich the blood proteome with potential cancer biomarkers that could be highly informative about the establishment, progression and metastatic dissemination of cancer. Nevertheless, the identification of low abundance and labile cancer specific biomarkers in blood remains extremely challenging. Low abundance markers are masked by high abundance proteins such as albumin, and by non-specific markers whose changes accompany many diseases. In this study, we analyzed a large cohort of human serum samples from a wide-range of cancer conditions and benign states, and utilized a rapid and powerful nanoparticle-based biomarker capture technology. METHODS- We utilized isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) core shell hydrogel particles, functionalized with two chemical baits, Cibacron blue F3GA and vinylsulfonic acid, for biomarker capture from 450 serum/plasma samples. Twenty age and stage-matched cancer and 20 to 40 benign/inflammatory controls were processed for each of the 7 cancer types, and proteins eluted from the particles were analyzed by high resolution LC-MS/MS analysis using an LTQ-Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher). All specimens were analyzed in a randomized, batch fashion, followed by an accurate comparison of the results in order to 1) identify a panel of biomarkers for each cancer type and distinguish protein which are involved in commons cancer mechanism and proteins which could uniquely indicate a particular cancer type and 2) avoid the technological bias that could be associated with the comparison of separated studies. RESULTS', ' For each cancer type we obtained a panel of hundreds of candidates biomarkers, a large number of them not previous identified by MS and/or never measured in plasma.

Characterization of these antibodies shows that they exhibit an extensive range of bioactive mechanisms. Unfortunately, there is not yet a reliable method by which to produce these important antibodies. Human antibodies may not require any molecular modification for therapeutic application and have a much faster pipeline to clinical studies than animal-derived antibodies. Lymph nodes are the primary destination of tumor or vaccine antigens. In the node, B cells undergo clonal expansion and somatic hypermutation, leading to the affinity-matured populations of effector B cells secreting antibodies that bind to the tumor or vaccine. The cancer vaccine-draining node is the ideal source of B cells that produce anticancer antibodies. Despite multiple human cancer vaccine studies, very little research has been done to recover the B cells responsible for vaccine-induced anticancer antibodies. In the present study, we used mononuclear cells from surgically removed vaccine-draining lymph nodes of melanoma patients vaccinated with 6 melanoma peptides derived from cancer-testis antigens and from melanocytic differentiation proteins for generating anti-vaccine peptide antibodies. The lymph node draining the vaccination site was localized by lymphatic mapping with a radiotracer. The development and maturity of B cells were assessed by determining phenotypic characters of lymph node cells using multicolor flow cytometry. The results showed that these vaccine-draining nodes contain high numbers of class-switched (CD19+CD27+IgD-IgM-) B cells and plasmablasts (CD19+CD38+IgM-). B-cell ELISpot assay was used to quantify the proportion of B cells in vaccine-draining lymph nodes that secrete anti-melanoma peptide antibodies. Positive ELISpot responses were observed in patients who also showed serum antibody-reactivity towards the vaccine peptides. The identification of lymph node cell samples exhibiting strong B-cell responses allows efficient generation and screening of hybridomas that secrete antibodies against cancer vaccine antigens. This study establishes a step-wise protocol for generating anti-cancer antibodies from vaccine-draining lymph nodes. We anticipate that the ability to reliably generate in vitro the same antibodies observed in the blood of vaccinated patients will further stimulate research to understand mechanisms of human antibody activity.']",

Importantly, progression to obesity can largely be slowed or reversed with aggressive lifestyle changes, thus also having the potential to mitigate cancer onset. A mouse model of environmental enrichment (EE) to improve motosensory, cognitive, and social stimulation by increasing physical engagement and social interaction triggers vast improvements in overall health. These include reducing adiposity, promoting the white to brown fat transition, mitigating diet-induced obesity (DIO), and decreasing progression of multiple cancer types including colon cancer and melanoma. We have elucidated the primary mechanism of the EE-induced phenotype to be the activation of the hypothalamic-sympathoneural-adipocyte (HSA) axis, a specific neuroendocrine route in which the brain communicates with adipose tissue. These benefits may also be partially attributable to the sharp drop in serum leptin levels following EE which has been implicated in diminishing tumorigenesis, invasiveness, and metastasis. Here we investigated the effects of EE on breast tumorigenesis in all body mass states and menopause-associated hormone conditions. Our preliminary studies showed that EE delayed the cancer onset in the MMTV-PyMT spontaneous mouse model of breast cancer. In addition the role of leptin signaling in the EE-induced effects on breast tumorigenesis was investigated by utilizing obese models with varied leptin signaling including leptin receptor-defective db/db mice that express extremely high levels of leptin, leptin-defective ob/ob mice that do not express leptin but are leptin-sensitive, and a diet-induced obesity (DIO) model with elevated leptin but intact leptin signaling. These obese mice were housed in EE or control housing until significantly attenuated weight gain was observed followed by implantation of primary PyMT-derived mammary tumor cells. EE was highly effective at reducing adiposity in each of these obesity models, regardless of leptin signaling. However, the effects of EE on mammary tumor progression were dependent on leptin signaling. EE decreased leptin level and inhibited mammary tumor growth in DIO mice. In contrast EE failed to attenuate tumor progression in ob/ob mice in the absence of leptin, suggesting that leptin is a key mediator of the EE anti-cancer effects on breast cancer. The elucidation of mechanisms of EE and the HSA axis-induced improvement in overall health will provide effective prevention as well as therapeutic strategies for metabolic syndromes and associated cancer types.']",

Pre- and post-therapy pharmacodynamic [PD] evaluation included total and free CCL2 in serum, circulating tumor and endothelial cell enumeration, cytokine profiles, mandated paired tumor biopsies (n=6) for tumor CCL2, CCR2 and macrophage subtypes and exploratory diffusion contrast-enhanced computed tomography (n=6). Results', ' 44 pts (21M/23F) were treated with CNTO 888', ' 21 pts in dose-escalation cohorts (0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 15 mg/kg) and 23 pts in 2 dose-expansion cohorts (10 and 15 mg/kg). Reversible grade (G) 3 liver enzymes elevation was seen in 1 pt with progressive liver metastases. No other drug-related G3-4 adverse events (AEs) or dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was seen. G1-2 AEs included fatigue, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, rash, and headache. PK data showed a dose-proportional increase in mean Cmax and AUC with bi- exponential decline and t1/2 of 4.4-6.9 d. Doses of 10 mg/kg q14d achieved steady-state concentrations required for antitumor activity as defined in preclinical models. Dose-dependent increases in bound CCL2 levels of >1,000-fold were demonstrated. Antitumor activity was observed in 4 pts; CA125 response and RECIST stable disease (SD) for 10 months (m) in ovarian cancer, PSA response and SD for 5m in prostate cancer, 7m SD in ocular melanoma and 15m SD in neuroendocrine tumor. Conclusions', ' CNTO 888 is well tolerated with no DLT. PKs are dose proportional, with evidence of PD target modulation and antitumor activity. The recommended phase II dose for single-agent CNTO 888 is 15 mg/kg q14d. Phase II studies are ongoing in prostate and planned in ovarian cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', \" The use of liquid biopsies, where limited or no tumor tissue is available, is increasingly important for molecular demographics, diagnostics and pharmacodynamic monitoring of patients during therapy.The ICE COLD-PCR (ICP) technique preferentially amplifies sequence alterations in samples having either vast excesses of wild-type sequence or when sample DNA quantity is sub-optimal. ICP delivers unbiased, high-level enrichment of gene regions enabling determination of point mutations and insertions/deletions using Sanger sequencing, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) or droplet digital PCR (ddPCR).This is especially important when sample DNA, e.g. from circulating free DNA, exosomes and circulating tumor cells (CTCs), is insufficient for multiplexed analysis.A critical limitation of mutational analysis of such samples is the need for increasing amounts of DNA for detecting very low-level mutations. A range of 100 to330 ng of substrate DNA is usually needed for reliable detection of alterations present at 0.01% in the sample DNA; this is not feasible with the limited quantities of blood/plasma/serum from clinical trials. ICP's ability to enrich alterations can provide a 100-fold increase in Sanger, NGS and ddPCR sensitivity.Materials and Methods\", ' To increase throughput, address the limiting amounts of DNA present in these samples and provide enriched amplification from many different gene regions in a single DNA sample, a multiplex ICP approach has been developed (MX-ICP). This MX-ICP method provides enrichment of any alteration present in all targeted genes from a single sample of DNA. When MX-ICP products are analyzed by Sanger, NGS or ddPCR, lower quantities of sample DNA can be used for detection of mutations at 0.01%.We compared detection of low-level of mutations in limiting amounts of DNA, with or without the use of MX-ICP prior to NGS and ddPCR, using digitally verified chromosomal DNA mixtures from Horizon Diagnostics. The alterations analyzed were from (1) CTC and NSCLC patients plasma, (2) longitudinal sampling of melanoma patients and (3) CTCs isolated from NSCLC patients. In all cases, use of MX-ICP, prior to analysis using NGS or ddPCR, enabled very sensitive detection with low amounts of input DNA.Conclusion', ' MX-ICP is a key component of procedures for sensitive detection and monitoring of genetic alterations in multiple targets using a single DNA sample. Coupling MX-ICP with platforms such as NGS and ddPCR enables the use of these powerful technologies for high sensitivity detection and monitoring of liquid biopsies from cancer patients. The combination of MX-ICP with NGS and ddPCR platforms means that they can be used efficiently for detection of alterations at0.01% in samples with <100 ng DNA. This enables monitoring and detection of alterations in the low volumes of liquid biopsies obtained from patients and clinical trials.']",

        "Background":"['Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) accounts for approximately 2% of diagnosed malignancies in canines. The majority of canine TCCs are invasive, intermediate to high grade tumors sharing similarities with human muscle invasive TCCs in risk factors, histology, sites of metastasis, and therapeutic response to single agents. Whole exome sequencing of canine TCC tumors was performed to identify somatic mutations in known cancer driver and repressor genes that could potentially contribute to canine TCC pathogenesis. A valine to glutamic acid mutation in BRAF homologous to the activating V600E mutation identified in human melanoma, colorectal and thyroid cancers was identified in 70% of sequenced tumors. Sensitivity to the BRAFV600E inhibitor Vemurafenib was tested in three BRAF mutant canine TCC cell lines (Bliley, Tyler1 and Tyler2) and two BRAF wild type canine TCC cell lines (Angus1 and Kinsey). All five canine TCC cell lines exhibited IC50s greater than 10μM, with BRAF mutant cell lines being slightly more sensitive. These sensitivity ranges are similar to those of some mutant human colorectal cancer cell lines, indicating that additional mechanisms may contribute to Vemurafenib resistance. Western blot analysis was performed to measure relative abundance of pERK, a downstream target of BRAF, in canine TCCs in response to serum starvation. All TCC cell lines showed sustained pERK expression in the absence of serum, indicating constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. The five canine TCC lines were treated with 15μM Vemurafenib for 6 and 24 hours and their lysates were analyzed for pERK protein expression. pERK abundance was decreased in only the BRAF mutant cell lines after 6 hours of treatment. However, this decrease was less pronounced after 24 hours, suggesting that resistance mechanisms are bypassing BRAF to activate ERK. Sequence analysis of an additional panel of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded canine TCCs also revealed a mutation in RanBP2 in 31% of samples. Strikingly, the RanBP2 mutation appeared to be mutually exclusive to BRAF V to E mutant tumors with only two of the analyzed samples carrying both mutations. Significant tumor heterogeneity was implicated due to low level mutant amplification in these samples. It has been reported that loss of RanBP2 is synthetic lethal in BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer. Since RanBP2 forms complexes with CRM1 at the nuclear pore complex for nuclear export and at the kinetochore during mitosis, canine TCC cell lines were treated with KPT-185, a CRM1 inhibitor. BRAF mutant TCC cell lines had IC50 values ranging from 45nM to 65nM and were approximately ten-fold more sensitive than wild type cell lines. Overall, this data indicates that the pathogenesis of canine TCC likely depends on driving factors in addition to constitutive BRAF signaling, but Vemurafenib resistant BRAF mutant tumors can be targeted through inhibition of the nucleopore complex.']",

Therefore, the aim of the current study is to assess AFP, MAGE1 and MAGE 3, CK, and HCC cancer stem cell (CSC) markers (CD133, CD90, CD44) as potential biomarkers for HCC patients.Patients and Methods. This study was conducted on the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of one 130 participants involving 70 patients with HCC, thirteen patients with chronic hepatitis (CH) and 30 normal controls. For those patients, serum AFP was tested by ELISA. Telomerase, MAGE 1, and MAGE 3, CD90 and CD44 RNA expression was detected by qualitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). CD133 and CK expression was measured by flowcytometry (FCM) and qPCR analysis in 10 ml of PBL of each patient.Results. All CH and HCC patients were positive for HCV antibodies. The number of cells expressing CD 133 in the patients PBL was significantly lower in HCC patients than other groups while that of CD90 and CD44 was significantly higher in HCC than in the other groups (p<0.01). Also, MAGE-1,MAGE-3, AFP, CD90 and CD44 expressions by qPCR were significantly higher (p<0.001) in HCC group than in chronic hepatitis and normal control groups. There was a highly significant difference (p<0.001) between groups for telomerase gene expression, which was detected in 10% and 42.3% of CHC and HCC patients respectively. The expression levels of AFP, CD44 and CD90 correlated significantly with HCC stage (r=.461, p=0.001), grade and multicentricity (r=.244, p=0.02) while CD133 showed a significant correlation with tumor size (r=.455, P=0.006) but not significantly correlated with multicentricity and HCC stage.

An anti-GPNMB antibody drug conjugate, Glembatumumab Vedotin (CDX-011), is currently in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of metastatic TNBC patients, with promising outcomes. Positron Emission Tomography using radiolabeled antibodies could be advantageous in stratifying patients who may benefit from CDX-011, tracking the biodistribution of CDX-011, and assessing GPNMB expression in vivo. To this end, we radiolabeled the naked antibody, Glembatumumab (CR011), with the positron-emitting 89Zr (half life = 3.3 days). We characterized the stability, affinity, rate of cellular internalization, and specificity of 89Zr-CR011 using various cell-binding assays in human TNBC cell lines. We determined that 89Zr-CR011 is stable in serum solution for up to 5 days, binds specifically to GPNMB+ TNBC cells with high affinity (KD = 16 nM), and internalizes rapidly (50% within 30 - 60 min). We conducted a biodistribution study from 1 - 12 days post administration via tail vein in GPNMB+ MDA-MB-468 xenografts to determine the time point at which we achieve the optimal tumor-to-nontarget ratios. A subset of mice was administered a blocking dose of unlabeled CR011 (100-fold excess, 1 mg/mouse), where we observed a 2.5-fold reduction in 89Zr-CR011 tumor uptake, confirming the specificity of 89Zr-CR011 for GPNMB+ TNBC tumors.

IDO1 inhibition has shown promising clinical benefit as well as exacerbated toxicity in the treatment of melanoma, when combined with the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab.We have discovered a novel class of highly selective small molecule inhibitors of IDO1 which surpass the potency of the compounds currently in clinical development. These compounds potently inhibit IDO1 activity in IFN- stimulated HeLa cells with single digit nM potency. Importantly, they also retain their potency in the presence of human serum, with IC50 values ranging between 5 and 15 nM in this more physiologically relevant media. Consistent with the role of IDO1+ dendritic cells in the suppression of T cell proliferation, this series of molecules is capable of restoring the proliferative capacity of human T cells (which is inhibited by allogeneic IDO1+ dendritic cells) with EC50 values of 2-3 nM. The molecules exhibit preclinical PK characteristics that are suitable for assessing the contribution of IDO1 to tumor growth in murine models, both alone and in combination with other therapeutic agents. The compounds have high metabolic stability against cultured human hepatocytes and exhibit preclinical PK and ADME characteristics consistent with once-daily dosing in humans.

Autoantibody signatures have value in the diagnosis and management of autoimmune disorders and may be valuable for detection of cancers. Previous groups have applied several techniques to identify cancer-specific autoimmune responses with varying degrees of success. A lack of high throughput methods to rapidly screen large numbers of patient samples and validate multiple antigens of interest is an important bottleneck in the development of autoantibodies as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis.We tested normal and cancer patient sera against protein arrays generated using a gene library capable of expressing full-length human proteins. Autoantibodies against proteins in these arrays were identified using electrochemiluminescence detection technology from MSD, a proven technology for high-throughput, array-based measurements. This approach offers key advantages over existing array-based approaches by providing a high-throughput, sensitive, and specific assay platform, with large-scale protein arrays. This approach also enables a rapid transition from antigen discovery to clinical validation using small focused arrays on the same diagnostic platform.Protein arrays containing 7,000 unique (non-redundant) full-length human proteins were generated using a eukaryotic expression system. This set of proteins represents a significant portion (28-35%) of the human proteome. We estimate that greater than 80% of autoantibodies recognize unmodified epitopes on single protein antigens; the protein arrays, therefore, should be highly representative of the vast majority of autoantigens. These proteome-scale arrays were used to screen for cancer-specific autoantibodies in patient serum samples. Patient samples were initially screened as pools (n=5) followed by screening of individual patient samples.Initial screening was done using samples from patients with breast, lung, ovarian, prostate, colon, kidney, melanoma, and pancreatic cancers. Control samples included samples from normal patients as well as those with benign breast disease, bronchial dysplasia, benign ovarian disease, and benign prostate hyperplasia. Samples from patients with breast, lung, ovarian, and prostate cancers were sub-divided into additional groups based on clinical findings. In total we screened 22 different groups of patients.We validated this approach with the recovery of well-established tumor antigen p53 and additional antigens. Ovarian cancer yielded the highest percentage of positive autoantibody responses with 21% for p53, 8% for DEK, and 6% for GMPR2. Further evaluation of this approach using sets of molecularly classified patient samples may improve the discovery of diagnostic autoantigens in cancer, especially in combination with patient-specific protein arrays determined from tumor whole-genome sequencing data.']",

Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying HCC metastasis remain largely unclear. Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) is a master regulator of tumor metastasis. We previously reported that FoxM1 promoted metastasis and indicated poor prognosis in HCC. Using a cDNA microarray, we found that FoxM1 upregulated a number of metastatic-related genes expression. Of particular interest was Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5 (ACP5). ACP5 has been shown to be significantly upregulated in breast cancer and melanoma and is a useful serum marker for extensive bone metastasis. We hypothesize that FoxM1-mediated ACP5 expression may play a role in HCC metastasis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic significance of ACP5 in HCC and the potential role of ACP5 in FoxM1-mediated invasiveness and metastasis. Methods', ' This study employed a tissue microarray containing samples from 406 HCC patients who underwent curative resection to examine the expression of ACP5 and its correlation with clinicopathological characteristics. The effect of ACP5 on FoxM1-mediated invasiveness and metastasis were performed by transwell assays and an orthotopically metastatic model. Results', ' Serial deletion, site-directed mutagenesis, and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that ACP5 is a direct transcriptional target of FoxM1. ACP5 expression was markedly higher in HCC tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues. ACP5 overexpression was correlated with microvascular invasion, poor differentiation, and higher tumor-node-metastasis stage. HCC patients with positive ACP5 expression had poorer prognosis than those with negative ACP5 expression. A multivariate analysis revealed that ACP5 expression was an independent and significant risk factor for disease recurrence and reduced patient survival following curative resection. Transwell assays and an orthotopic metastatic model showed that the upregulation of ACP5 promoted HCC invasion and lung metastasis, whereas ACP5 knockdown inhibited these processes. ACP5 promotes cell motility through the inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation at Tyr397. The knockdown of ACP5 significantly attenuated FoxM1-enhanced invasion and lung metastasis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that ACP5 expression was positively correlated with FoxM1 expression in human HCC tissues. Patients with positive coexpression of FoxM1 and ACP5 had shorter overall survival and higher recurrence times than those with negative coexpresssion of FoxM1 and ACP5.
