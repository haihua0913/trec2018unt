        "Background":"['Background', ' Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) originates from parafollicular C cells of the thyroid gland, and are associated with activating constitutional or somatic mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. The common somatic mutation of codon 918 is associated with a less favorable clinical outcome. The catalytic component of telomerase, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) has been found to be reactivated in most human tumors. Objective', ' In this study, we aimed to investigate telomerase involvement in relation the RET mutational status in MTC. Design', ' Our study includes 43 cases of MTC from the Karolinska University Hospital. RET mutations were identified by sequencing of the hot spots in exons 10,_11-,_15-, and 16. Expression of the TERT gene, telomerase activity and telomere length were quantified. Result', ' Among the 43 cases, 18 carried a RET point mutation in exon15 or exon16 (Group I), 5/43 had a point mutation in exon 10 or 11 (Group II), and 20 were wild-type (Group III). Telomerase activity and TERT expression were closely associated. The TERT gene was expressed in 13/18 cases in Group I, in 0/5 in Group II and in 10/20 of Group III. The median telomerase activity was higher in Group I as compared to Groups II and III. Group I tumors showed the shortest relative telomere length. With regard to follow-up, cases with high telomerase activity and TERT gene expression in Group I had less favorable outcome. Conclusion', ' The findings suggest that TERT/telomerase activity may contribute to aggressive MTC in addition to, or as a consequence of, RET codon 918 mutations. The very low telomerase activity and TERT expression revealed in several of the MTC cases suggest the involvement of alternative mechanisms for telomere stabilization in the MTC entity.']",

The down-regulation of RET with berberine also results in the suppression of cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest and activation of apoptosis in TT cells.

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' CR8 (ManRos Therapeutics) is a novel inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that selectively targets CDK1/2/3/5/7/9. CDK inhibitors have already shown potent antitumoral activity. Recently, vandetanib (Astra Zeneca), a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC). The absence of complete tumor responses justifies the development of new therapeutic options. The aim of this study was to investigate the preclinical activity of CR8 alone and in combination with vandetanib in a MTC model. Materials and Methods', ' The human MTC TT cell line, bearing a RETC634W activating mutation, was cultured in the absence or the presence of CR8 (10-10 000 nM) and/or vandetanib over 6 days. Cell proliferation was assessed by WST-1 assay. Activation of RET, PP1 and oncogenic pathways (PI3K/AKT, MEK/p44-42) was analyzed by western-immunoblotting. Calcitonin secretion in cell culture media was measured by ELISA. Results', ' Both CR8 and vandetanib when used alone strongly inhibit TT cell proliferation at day 3 of treatment. Addition of CR8 (10 nM) enhances the antiproliferative activity of low vandetanib concentrations. As expected, vandetanib alone inhibits RET, MAPK and AKT phosphorylation and CR8 inhibits PP1. Interestingly, CR8 alone induces activation of RET, MAPK and AKT phosphorylation, and the addition of vandetanib (>100 nM) inhibits RET signalling pathways. At day 3 of treatment, vandetanib (>100 nM) and CR8 (100 nM) reduced and induced calcitonin secretion, respectively. Conclusion', ' CR8 displays an antiproliferative effect on TT cells and enhances the antiproliferative activity of vandetanib. CR8 acts by inhibiting PP1 and, surprisingly, induces an activation of RET and stimulates calcitonin production. These results suggest that the combination of vandetanib with CDKs inhibitors such as CR8 may be of value to improve therapeutic response.']",

        "Background":"['RET (REarranged during Transfection) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (TK), which plays pivotal roles in regulating cell survival, differentiation, proliferation, migration and chemotaxis. Activating mutations in RET (C634W and M918T) have been identified in both familial and sporadic forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and correlate with aggressive disease progression, validating RET as a classical oncogene. Furthermore the recent identification of RET fusions (CCDC6-RET and KIF5B-RET) present in 1% of lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) patients has renewed interest in the identification and development of more selective RET inhibitors lacking the toxicities associated with the current treatments.At present, there are no known specific RET inhibitors in clinical development, although many potent inhibitors of RET have been identified opportunistically through selectivity profiling of compounds initially designed to target other TKs. Such secondary RET inhibitors include the clinical agents Vandetanib and Cabozantinib, both approved for use in MTC, but additional pharmacological activities (most notably inhibition of KDR) lead to dose-limiting toxicity.Using a robust screening cascade developed in house, we have measured RET and KDR inhibitory activity in vitro and in relevant cell line models to assess compound potency and selectivity. Anti-proliferative activity and off-target toxicity of these agents have also been measured. Although these competitor compounds displayed reasonable RET potency in cellular assays and this translated into anti-proliferative effects in our MTC and LAD disease models, as expected none met our target candidate criteria, clearly highlighting the need for therapeutic agents with improved selectivity.Guided by structure-based drug design, we have identified and optimised a novel series of potent and selective inhibitors of the RET kinase domain. These agents met our stringent criteria for enzyme and cell selectivity and, whilst potent in a RET-driven cell line, display little overt toxicity in a matched non-RET driven cell line. Herein, we describe the chemical optimisation of these agents and, using structural information, rationalise their improved selectivity.']",

In order to explore this link, we have investigated the expression of RET in a large cohort of over 400 thyroid tumour samples of multiple histologies, ranging from benign lesions through to aggressive, metastatic disease by immunhistochemistry using a thyroid tissue microarray. Our data suggest that RET expression may correlate with more aggressive phenotype across a broader spectrum of tumours than previously predicted. We are currently investigating this association further; first by examining the expression of two major RET protein isoforms, RET9 and RET51, in this panel of tumours, and second, by investigating the coexpression of RET with another group of proteins associated with tumour progression, the integrin family.

        "Background":"[\"One of the hallmarks of human cancers is the intrinsic or acquired resistance to apoptosis. Apoptosis resistance contributes to carcinogenesis, tumor progression, and treatment resistance. Patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) have been shown to be resistant to standard chemotherapy and conventional radiotherapy. Dominant activating mutations in the RET protooncogene are the cause of hereditary MTC and are found in more than 40% of sporadic cases. Despite an ever-growing wealth of information about RET's role in cell survival/proliferation, a detailed understanding of how this tyrosine kinase receptor acts to prevent cell death in tumorigenesis remains elusive. We hypothesized that activated RET prevents apoptosis by repressing the transcription of the proapoptotic gene Noxa in the nucleus in response to genotoxic or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.Here we report that activated RET translocates to the nucleus in cultured MTC cells as well as MTC primary tumor tissues. RET is recruited to the Noxa promoter and is able to repress its transcription. The formation of the RET-Noxa promoter complex depends on RET expression and requires the tyrosine kinase activity of RET. Additionally, stable depletion of RET in MTC cells, using lentiviral shRNA, sensitizes MTC cells to genotoxic or endoplasmic reticulum stress. We specifically show that RET is recruited to the Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) binding site on the Noxa promoter. RET physically interacts with ATF4 and phosphorylates ATF4 leading to the blockage of its transcriptional activity. Moreover, RET knockdown is associated with increased ATF4-dependent expression of Noxa. Inhibition of RET kinase activity by sunitinib results in ATF4 activation, induction of Noxa expression and apoptosis. Conversely, silencing of ATF4 in MTC cells decreased sunitinib-mediated Noxa induction and apoptosis. ATF4 protein levels markedly decreased and/or localized in the cytoplasm of 60% of primary MTC (n=40) and associated with poor overall survival.Our data suggest that RET activating mutations confers resistance to chemotherapeutic agents by preventing apoptosis through inhibition of ATF4 activity and repression of proapoptotic gene Noxa. These findings reveal the importance of nuclear localization of RET, as newly discovered modulator of nuclear gene expression. This newly identified interaction between RET kinase and ATF4 has important implication for MTC and other RET/ATF4-mediated cancer types. Since ATF4 transcription is induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress, and activation of ATF4 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, the concept of promoting endoplasmic reticulum stress in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors could be considered as a therapeutic strategy for cancer.\"]",

The transcriptional inhibitor of the RET gene was initially screened from the NCI chemical libraries using the cell-based luciferase reporter gene assay, which has a promoter sequence identical to the RET promoter. As a result of our screening effort, a small molecule, nonactin, has been identified as a potential lead compound, downregulating the transcriptional activity of the RET gene promoter. The effect of this molecule in the downregulation of the RET mRNA levels and the protein levels was confirmed by RT-PCR and western blotting respectively. We also observed that Egr1 expression is downergulated in a dose dependent manner by this small molecule, which is in correlation with the RET downregulation. The RET promoter has a highly conserved GC rich region, which acts as a binding site for Egr-1, which is involved in the transcription of many growth factor genes.

Since these mutations are known to induce oncogenic activation of RET tyrosine kinase, various therapeutic strategies interfering with the oncogenic function of RET protein have been developed and tested for treating RET-associated cancers in several preclinical and clinical studies. Our previous study has demonstrated that the G-rich strand in the polypurine/polypyrimidine (pPu/pPy) region of the RET proximal promoter is capable of forming intramolecular G-quadruplex structures in vitro in the presence of K+, which can be further stabilized by a G-quadruplex interactive agents. Thus, the detailed mechanism by which G-quadruplex structures regulate RET transcription has been studied using mutation analysis and promoter reporter assays together with a detailed analysis of transcription factor binding to the RET promoter in vivo. To this end, we have explored the Flp-In cell system using homologous recombination, which allows integration of a single copy of a wild type or G-quadruplex-mutant RET promoterluciferase construct into a specific genomic recombination locus (FRT site) in a host Flp-In the human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell line. Thus, differences in reporter expression levels from isolated isogenic cell clones can be ascribed more confidently to promoter-specific effects, rather than enhancer/silencer artifacts due to variations in integration sites.

        "Meeting_name":" RET and integrin crosstalk provides functional plasticity",
        "Background":"['The RET receptor tyrosine kinase is an important mediator of cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. RET becomes activated upon formation of a complex with the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligand and GDNF-family receptor (GFRa), which leads to activation of multiple downstream signalling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, MEK/ERK, STAT3, and SRC. Constitutive activation of RET, through translocations or missense mutations, leads to papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), respectively. Also, RET expression has been detected in pancreatic and breast cancers, and has been linked to increased metastatic potential. In order to clarify the underlying role of RET in tumour progression, we examined the relationship between RET and two integrin subunits, 1 (ITGB1) and 3 (ITGB3). Integrin proteins are important for cell attachment to the extracellular matrix and focal adhesion (FA) formation. Functionally, integrins are important for cell-adhesion and migration as they provide traction and leverage for cell movement. Previously, we have shown that RET is able to increase cell-migration and adhesion, and that both ITGB1 and ITGB3 are important for these processes. Here, we show that RET-mediated cell-migration is persistent over 24 hours, and that patterns of cell-adhesion fluctuate over this time, predictably representing different forces needed to move across the microenvironment. Cell-adhesion is increased upon 1 hour of GDNF treatment, but is lost between 3-12 hours of GDNF treatment. Interestingly, we observed that ITGB1 activation downstream of RET, detected by co-immunoprecipitation with paxillin, is transient, and lasts for 1 hour. Conversely, ITGB3 activation downstream of RET, detected using an active heterodimer-specific antibody, is sustained between 1-12 hours of GDNF treatment. These results demonstrate unique functional roles for ITGB1 and ITGB3 downstream of RET. We also examined the importance of signalling pathways downstream of RET for integrin activation, and found that, in a 2D collagen environment, PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK are important for RET-mediated FA formation. However, in a 3D collagen environment where cells formed spheroids, PI3K/AKT and STAT3 are important for cell-outgrowth, downstream of RET activation. This likely represents different cellular responses needed to overcome environment-specific obstacles. Finally, we showed evidence for a relationship between RET, ITGB1 and ITGB3 in tumour progression using a cohort of various clinically annotated thyroid cancer samples. Ultimately, we have shown a role for in activation of two integrin subunits, ITGB1 and ITGB3, downstream of RET and how each of these proteins may contribute to metastatic events, particularly those involved in thyroid cancer.']",

Animal models do not faithfully recapitulate the full clinical spectrum of the disease. Moreover, it has been suggested that primitive malignant stem cells could be at the origin of resistances and relapses in patients treated with standard chemotherapy. In order to modelling MEN2A malignant primitive stem cells, we have induced to pluripotency MEN2A peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients who developed medullary thyroid carcinoma harboring high risk or moderate risk RET mutation.MethodsPBMC from patients with germline RETC620R and RetC634Y mutations were reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells using Sendai-virus mediated Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc gene transfer. An isogenic IPSC line was generated by genome editing, using CRISPR-Cas9 to correct the high risk RETC634Y mutation. Hallmarks of pluripotency, genotype and phenotypes were characterized.ResultsPluripotency behaviour of each IPSC line was confirmed in vitro (EBs, and pluripotent markers) and in vivo (teratoma assay in immunodeficient mice). Genome edition of the RETC634Y iPSC led to the generation of the RETY634C isogenic control iPSC. Ret expression was confirmed on both RETC634Y and RETY634C. In order to determine the accuracy and absence of off-target effects, we have performed a whole exome sequencing of both RET-mutated and RET-corrected IPSCs. These experiments revealed some off target effects of the CRISPR-mediated gene edition. Gene-array datas revealed an increased expression of neuronal development-related set of genes in RETC634Y iPSC, as compared to RETY634C control, that may account for the development of certain MEN2A features. Treatment of IPSC with vandetanib, a Ret inhibitor, led to a decrease of iPSC colonies formation in RETC634Y mutated iPSC compared to RETY634C, suggesting that RET-iPSC could serve as a plateform drug screening model. The comprehensive pathological assessment of IPSC RET-mutated and corrected derived-teratoma did not reveal, at this point, any neuroendocrine tumor-reminiscent structure.ConclusionWe report here the first MEN2A-iPSC from high risk RETC634Y iPSC and its genome-edited isogenic normal IPSC, with their genomic profiling by whole exome sequencing. These well caracterized RET-IPSC will allow to develop cell-based assays in high throughput screening for drug discovery and to model MEN2A.']",

There are two distinct isoforms of RET, RET9 and RET51, with in vitro evidence indicating isoforms induce unique phosphorylation patterns on select tyrosine residues, possess different cell transforming and differentiation abilities, and bind/activate a unique set of substrates. However, these processes are challenging to dissect in complex organisms because both RET isoforms are ubiquitously co-expressed. We have generated a novel Caenorhabditis elegans model for RET expression to dissect the role of individual RET isoforms. C. elegans do not encompass a homologue of RET, thus we injected chimeric constructs in which human RET isoform sequences were fused to a N-terminal myristoylation signal for membrane targeting and expressed under the control of the C. elegans mechanosensory neuron-specific promoter, mec-4. The resultant transgenic animals were scored for phenotypes of RET-expressing neurons. We found that RET9 expressing animals have near WT phenotype, while RET51 expressing animals exhibited an axon termination phenotype where the PLM mechanosensory neuron of the tail fails to migrate to its correct location. This is indicative of early neuron terminal differentiation attributed to RET downstream signalling. Furthermore, strains harboring constitutively active oncogenic versions of RET9 or RET51 had severe PLM axon defects, with the RET51 phenotype being significantly more penetrant. Through generating strains with point mutations at select tyrosine residues and assessing the resulting phenotype, we have determined Y1062 and Y1096 to be main signalling hubs contributing to the RET-mediated phenotype in C. elegans. We are currently testing known kinase inhibitors, assessing efficacy and toxicity of potential RET inhibiting therapeutics. Using C. elegans as a platform to model RET is a quick and efficient system to gain insight on RET isoforms, delineate molecular events contributing to cancer progression, and investigate therapeutic agents that can be used to treat RET associated cancers.']",

        "Background":"['RET, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) expressed mainly in neural crest-derived tissues, plays a role in cell growth and differentiation and its physiological activation depends upon binding to the GDNF family. Genetic aberrations leading to constitutive RET activation are well-established as oncogenic events. Activating point mutations of RET, for example, are present in ca. 70% of medullary thyroid carcinoma patients including all hereditary cases, while RET gene rearrangements resulting in production of activated RET fusion proteins occur in approximately 10% of sporadic papillary thyroid carcinomas. More recently, recurring RET gene rearrangements have also been found in 1-2 % of lung adenocarcinomas and subsets of other solid tumors including colorectal and salivary gland carcinomas. Thus RET kinase represents an actionable therapeutic target in multiple clinical settings with high medical need. Consequently several small-molecule inhibitors targeting this kinase have been explored in clinical settings. A common feature of most advanced agents is their lack of selectivity and in particular their potent cross-reactivity against VEGFR2, an RTK whose inhibition is associated with serious, dose-limiting cardiovascular toxicity. Indeed, the high homology between the two kinases renders identification of ATP competitive compounds that selectively inhibit RET over VEGFR2 a highly challenging task. Here we describe the preclinical activity of NMS-E668, a potent and selective ATP-competitive RET inhibitor characterized by favorable activity, selectivity and ADME profiles. Biochemically, NMS-E668 has an excellent selectivity profile against a panel of >50 kinases, notably including >10-fold selectivity over VEGFR2. Selectivity of NMS-E668 for RET vs. VEGFR2 was confirmed in NIH-3T3 cells engineered to express activated forms of these kinases. NMS-E668 potently (IC50 circa 50 nM) and selectively inhibited proliferation of RET-dependent tumor cells, including TT medullary carcinoma cells harboring a RET C634W activating point mutation and LC2/ad lung carcinoma cells bearing the oncogenic fusion protein CCDC6-RET. NMS-E668 also potently inhibited IL3-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing KIF5B-RET, the RET rearrangement that is most commonly found in lung adenocarcinomas. Cellular mechanism studies confirmed that NMS-E668 inhibits RET autophosphorylation and downstream signaling at doses consistent with antiproliferative activity. Tested in vivo against KIF5B-RET-driven Ba/F3 tumors, NMS-E668 displayed >90% tumor growth inhibition accompanied by target modulation following oral administration at 10 and 20 mg/kg, with prolonged tumor regressions observed at the higher dose. Thus NMS-E668, a potent and VEGFR2-sparing RET inhibitor is an innovative and highly promising candidate for further development.']",

        "Background":"['The RET (REarranged in Transfection) receptor tyrosine kinase is crucial for the normal development of the kidneys and enteric nervous system, as well as the regulation of neural-crest cell behaviours, including migration, proliferation, differentiation and survival. RET is also a potent contributor to clinically challenging cancers. Activating mutations in RET can lead to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, a cancer syndrome characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma. Increased activation of wildtype RET receptors has been linked to aggressive breast cancers, and enhanced invasion and perineural spread in pancreatic carcinoma. Two distinct isoforms of the growth factor receptor arise through alternative splicing of the 3 exons, and are termed RET9 and RET51 to denote the number of amino acids in each C-terminal tail. These isoforms induce unique transphosphorylation patterns on intracellular tyrosine residues, differentially bind downstream signalling proteins, and possess different intrinsic abilities to cause cellular transformation. Here, we explore the differential subcellular localization and trafficking of the two isoforms in human cell line models to better understand RET-mediated cancers. We have observed that RET51 is efficiently matured and localized to the cell membrane, while immature RET9 matures more slowly, leading to lower relative expression on the plasma membrane. Subsequent to RET activation, both isoforms at the cell surface are internalized through AP2-adaptor interactions and the clathrin coated-pit pathway into endosomes. Although RET51 is internalized more rapidly than RET9, a portion of RET51 molecules recycles back to the plasma membrane, maintaining high expression levels at the cell surface. We have shown that RET51 interacts with the sorting protein GGA3, which may allow the long isoform to travel back to the cell surface. Recycling prevents efficient degradation of RET51, allowing for prolonged downstream signaling relative to RET9. Since RET51 has a longer residency time in an endosomal compartment, where sustained Erk1/2 signaling promotes mitogenesis, this may in part explain the greater transforming potential of RET51. Together, our data suggest that differences in RET isoform subcellular localization and trafficking would lead to differences in signal transduction and may in part explain the functional differences observed between RET isoforms.']",

Oncogenic mutations of the RET proto-oncogene are found in all hereditary MTC and 45% of the sporadic cases. However, it is clear that additional genetic lesions contribute to the development of both RET-dependent and RET independent MTC. We analyzed 30 primary medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) tumors by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays (Agilent 244K) and a subset of those tumors by ultra-high-resolution SNP arrays (Affymetrix SNP6.0). A consistent finding with both arrays was a loss localized to 22q13.1 in 40% of tumors. This region contains the ATF4 gene and loss of this gene was validated by real time PCR.ATF4 is a central mediator of integrated stress response pathway and activates expression of a cohort of downstream target genes known to be involved in cell survival, apoptosis, autophagy and senescence. We hypothesize that the loss of ATF4 expression contributes to MTC progression through mechanisms involving aberrant proliferation and escape from apoptosis. We present several findings to support this. First, ATF4 protein levels were found downregulated in 50% MTC tumor tissues (n = 43) and low ATF4 expression was associated with poor overall survival in MTC patients (HR = 5.015, 95% CI', ' 1.38-10.64), P = 0.013). A negative correlation was observed between RET and ATF4 protein expression in MTC tumors (r = -0.89, R square = 0.799, p<0.0001). Second, we showed that targeted heterozygote and homozygous deletion of Atf4 in mice causes C cell hyperplasia, a precancerous lesion preceding MTC. Third, ATF4 overexpression inhibits proliferation and survival of MTC derived cell lines. ATF4 decreases RET protein levels by inducing ubiquitination and degradation of activated RET. In contrast, ATF4 depletion upregulates RET protein levels as well as RET autophosphorylation. Finally, combination treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (sunitinib) and eeyarestatin that stimulates ATF4 transcription, induces apoptosis of the MTC cells in a synergistic manner through activation of ATF4 and its target genes NOXA and PUMA as well. These results suggest ATF4 as a potential tumor suppressor gene in MTC. We postulate that inactivation of ATF4 is a central impediment to induction of apoptosis in MTC tumors. Therefore, strategies to upregulate ATF4 during TKI therapy would render tumor cells exquisitely sensitive to stress induced apoptosis, offering a novel synergistic treatment.']",

We identified glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptor alpha 4 (GFR4), which associates with the RET receptor tyrosine kinase, as a putative antigenic target for CAR-based therapy of MTC. Using RNA in situ hybridization (RNAscope) and quantitative RT-PCR, we show that GFR4 is highly expressed in MTC. Normal tissue expression of GFR4 mRNA is restricted to parafollicular cells (C-cells) within the thyroid, the normal cell type from which MTC originates, and normal thymus.Based upon the highly restricted expression, we generated two high affinity single chain variable fragments (scFvs) targeting GFR4 isoforms a and b by selecting a nave rabbit antibody library by phage display. Second generation CARs bearing the CD137 costimulatory domain were constructed using these GFR4-specific scFvs. GFR4-specific CARTs trigger antigen-dependent cytotoxicity and cytokine production in vitro, and they are able to control pre-established TT cell tumors in an immunodeficient mouse xenograft model of MTC.

Ponatinib has recently been found to potently inhibit the common NSCLC fusion variant, KIF5B-RET at clinically-achievable concentrations.We have established large collection of colorectal patient derived xenografts (PDXs)4,5. Two of the poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, CR1520 and CR2518, contain two different chromosome 10 in-frame RET-fusions, CCDC6-RET (CR2518) and NCOA4-RET (CR1520), as revealed by RNAseq and Sanger Sequencing6. Both models have also demonstrated over-expressing ret gene at mRNA levels. More importantly, they both responded Ponatinib significantly along with dephosphorylation of RET and downstream AKT, confirming these two types of Ret fusions as oncogenic drivers in these two models6. In addition, we also observed that Ponatinib treatment also rapidly drives CR2518 into its resistance (The resistant derivative is called CR2545). To investigate the underlying mechanism of the resistance, we performed RNAseq analysis of CR2545, which revealed retaining of the ret-fusion, but also the introduction of a previously described gate-keeper mutation, V804M, at ret kinase domain. V804M, a mutation frequently found in familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), introduces bulky amino acid at position 804 and found to resistant to vandetanib. This may contribute to the resistance. However, this notion apparently contradicts to the previous observation/claim that V804M is sensitive to Ponatinib7, and ponatinib should be used to treat RET-V804M/L cancers. It is possible that the described V804M containing vandetanib resistant cells are sensitive to ponatinib, but via a non-RET mechanism for the multi-kinase inhibition nature of ponatinib; or in our case, there are other non-RET Ponatinib resistant mechanisms been introduced in CR2545 where RET is no longer the key oncogenic driver.

Based on the somatic variants identified, we describe the evolutionary pathway of the case, showing that bone marrow metastasis occurred separately to other metastatic sites. The presence of disease-associated SNPs within the RET proto-oncogene supports their inclusion as part of routine genetic testing for MTC cases. The copy number aberrations and chromothripsis-like pattern affected a much broader range of genes than single mutations and may have led to the widespread chromosomal instability evident, possibly contributing to the rapid fatal course of the case.

It typically presents late and does not respond to TSH inhibition or radio-iodine. Approximately 20% of MTCs are associated with one of three inherited syndromes (multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A, MEN 2B and familial medullary thyroid cancer) caused by germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, and all patients with MTC should be screened for RET mutations. Unaffected individuals who carry a germline RET mutation should undergo prophylactic thyroidectomy. We investigated referral rate for germline RET testing in an Irish MTC population.  Methods', '    The total number and type of thyroid cancers diagnosed in Ireland from 1998-2012 was obtained from the National Cancer Registry. The majority of germline genetic testing data in Ireland is completed through the National Centre of Medical Genetics (NCMG) and data on all RET tests ordered was extracted from NCMG records. These two databases were compared to determine the number of RET tests ordered on MTC cases during this time period.  Results', '  A total of 80 cases of MTC were diagnosed in Ireland during a 14 year period. Thirty-five RET full sequencing tests were requested during this time period. Additional RET mutation tests may have been ordered independent of NCMG. Eighteen cases of MTC were diagnosed in those under the age of 40, of these six had RET mutation testing performed.  Conclusions', '    Optimal prevention of MTC requires routine RET mutation testing of all affected individuals. This study suggests that not all Irish patients with MTC were offered RET mutation testing. A protocol of reflex referral of all cases for genetic testing should be implemented.']",

        "Background":"[\"Neuroendocrine (NE) cancers originate from secretory cells of the body's various endocrine structures. Surgical resection is the primary treatment for these tumors. However, the majority of NE cancers are metastatic at the time of detection and no effective adjuvant therapies exist for primary NE tumors or their metastases. Patients often develop two or more NE cancers, a syndrome termed multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN). DNA sequencing has lead to breakthroughs in the identification of the causes of familial forms of the four types of MEN syndromes. Mutations in a protein of unknown function, menin, are associated with MEN1. Mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase RET are linked to MEN2 and MEN3. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, CDNK1B, is mutated in MEN4. Unfortunately, a large percentage of NE cancers are sporadic, resulting from somatic mutations, and a high percentage of these do not harbor menin, RET, or CDNK1B mutations. Due to the lack of development of successful adjuvant therapies there has been little improvement in survival rates of NE cancer patients in the past several decades. Thus, there is a great need for the elucidation of signaling molecules that promote NE tumorigenesis in order to guide the development of novel and effective treatments for this family of cancers.Our laboratory has found that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is an important tumorigenic signaling molecule in sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), a type of NE cancer that originates from calcitonin-producing C cells in the thyroid. New data supports a role for Cdk5 in multiple types of NE cancer and provides a new prospective from which to explore their causes. Cdk5 is expressed in many NE cancers and inhibition of Cdk5 activity blocks growth of NE cancer cell lines. Phosphoproteomic analysis of growing versus arrested MTC tumors, induced by expression of the Cdk5 activator p25 in our transgenic mouse model of MTC, revealed elevation of over 200 phosphorylation sites. We have used short interfering peptides (SIPs) to selectively target a set of these phosphorylation sites and found that 15 of these SIPs blocked growth of NE cancer cell lines. Phosphorylation state specific antibodies were generated to several of these sites and phosphorylation levels were confirmed to be decreased in arrested MTC tumors. In conclusion, 1) multiple types of NE cancer cells are dependent on Cdk5 activity for growth, 2) phosphorylation of multiple signaling proteins is elevated downstream of Cdk5, and 3) select inhibition of these pathways blocks growth of NE cancer cells.Future studies will focus on analysis of these phosphoproteins in human NE tumors to validate of them as biomarkers for targeted cancer therapies as well as exploration of these phosphoproteins as direct targets for developing new therapeutics that are effective against NE cancers.\"]",

RET mutations are found in 50-95% of MTCs, with mutations at C634R (extracellular domain) and M918T (kinase domain) predominating. Recently, a translocation that results in formation of a KIF5B-RET fusion gene has been identified in 1-2% of NSCLCs. Ponatinib (AP24534) is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with potent activity against BCR-ABL being investigated in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Previously, ponatinib has been shown to potently inhibit the in vitro kinase activity of RET and the viability of Ba/F3 cells transformed to IL-3 independence through expression of a RET kinase domain artificially-activated via fusion to the TEL dimerization domain. Here, the activity of ponatinib was examined in Ba/F3 cells transformed with the most common, naturally-occurring activated variants of RET found in MTC and NSCLC. In addition, the activity of ponatinib was compared to that of 4 other multi-targeted TKIs with anti-RET activity in clinical development', ' vandetanib, cabozantinib, sunitinib and sorafenib.Results', ' Ponatinib potently inhibited viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing RETC634R, RETM918T and KIF5B-RET, with IC50s of 2, 3, and 11 nM, respectively. Consistent with these effects being due to inhibition of RET, ponatinib inhibited RET phosphorylation with similar potency in each respective cell line (IC50s of 4, 2, and 9 nM). The TKIs vandetanib (IC50', ' 448, 357 and 773 nM, respectively), cabozantinib (226, 100 and 292 nM), sunitinib (299, 312 and 570 nM) and sorafenib (>1000, 372 and 861 nM) also inhibited viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing RETC634R, RETM918T and KIF5B-RET, however the potency of all 4 TKIs was substantially reduced compared to that of ponatinib. Importantly, trough ponatinib concentrations (64 nM) observed in patients treated once daily with ponatinib (45 mg) substantially exceed IC50s for inhibition of each of the mutationally-activated RET variants. Additional studies to further evaluate the anti-RET activity of ponatinib and other TKIs, including their susceptibility to mutation-based resistance, are ongoing and will be presented.Conclusion', ' Ponatinib is a highly potent inhibitor of activated variants of RET found in MTC and NSCLC. The potency of ponatinib substantially exceeds that of other TKIs with anti-RET activity that are being evaluated in clinical trials.

        "Background":"['Background. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is associated with RET mutations and activation of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling pathways. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) contributes to functional stabilization of PI3K/AKT signaling and is required for growth factor inducible activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. A recent study showed that HSP90 is a molecular target for HIV protease inhibitor Nelfinavir (NFV). Treatment with NFV is associated with growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in breast, ovarian and prostate cancer cell lines. Objectives. We hypothesized that NFV-inducible inhibition of HSP90 would lead to down-regulation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways and induction of apoptosis in MTC cells. Methods. MTC-derived cells (TT cells) harboring the RET C634W mutation were treated with NFV at concentrations from 1M to 10M. Activation of MAPK/ERK and AKT/ mTOR/p70S6K/pS6 signaling was assessed by Western blot using specific phospho-antibodies. Apoptosis was determined by Western Blot with antibody against cleaved caspase 3. Cell growth and viability were determined by Vi-Cell analyzer and Alamar blue assay. HSP90 expression was examined in 12 human MTC tumor samples by immunostaining. HSP90 expression was correlated with pAKT and pERK level. Results. Treatment with NFV (1M to 10M for 48 hours) did not affect expression of HSP90 or levels of total AKT and ERK. In contrast, pAKT and pERK were inhibited in TT cells after treatment with NFV (5M and 10 M). Since both AKT and ERK pathways contribute to regulation of p70S6K/pS6 activity, we examined activation of this signaling axis. NFV (10M) decreased the level of p-p70S6K, p-pS6 and down-regulated Cyclin D1. Growth experiments demonstrated that the number of viable cells decreased by 30% and 85% after treatment with NFV at concentration 5M and 10M, respectively. Microscopy showed that exposure to NFV was associated with cell rounding and nuclear fragmentation, suggesting induction of apoptosis. Western blot analysis revealed that NFV induced caspase 3 cleavage in TT cells. In addition, treatment with NFV was associated with induction of H2AX, indicating DNA damage. Immunostaining of human MTC showed increased expression of HSP 90 in 5/12 of examined MTCs compared to corresponding normal thyroid tissue. The highest level of cytoplasmic HSP90 was detected in 3 cases of MTC harboring RET mutation, and co-localization staining showed that cells with high level of HSP90 expression also exhibited prominent pAKT and pERK. Conclusion. Treatment of MTC cell with clinically achievable concentrations of NFV results in down-regulation of AKT and ERK signaling and inhibition of MTC cell growth. Expression of HSP90 in human tumors suggests that it has a role in maintenance of anti-apoptotic signaling in MTC cells. Together these data support the potential utility of NFV for the treatment of patients with MTC.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis through the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) signaling and oncogenic RTK signaling is a promising therapeutic target in thyroid cancer. Lenvatinib mesilate (LEN) is the selective inhibitor of VEGFR1-3, and other proangiogenic and oncogenic pathway-related RTKs including fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1-4), the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) , KIT, and RET. We studied the antitumor and antiangiogenic activity of LEN by using various thyroid cancer models.Methods', ' Roles of RTK signaling pathways in 11 thyroid cancer (differentiated (DTC), medullary (MTC), and anaplastic (ATC)) cells were examined by testing antiproliferative activity of selective RTK inhibitors. Mutation profiling of DTC cells was done by MassARRAY systems. Antitumor and antiangiogenic (immunohistochemical staining of the endothelial cell marker CD31) activity of LEN was tested in s.c. xenograft models. Phosphorylation of molecules in the FGFR1 and RET signaling pathways was evaluated through Western blotting (WB). Pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker analyses of VEGF and FGF signaling pathway in xenograft models by treatment of LEN were performed.Results', 'DTC', \" Molecular profiling in DTC cells showed K1 cells had BRAF V600E and PIK3CA mutation (E542K). Other DTC cells didn't have active tumor driver mutations. Among 5 DTC cells, only RO82-W-1 (W1) cell showed the selective sensitivity against LEN and FGFR selective inhibitors (PD166866 and PD173074). W1 cells overexpressed FGFR1 and LEN inhibited bFGF-induced phosphorylation of FGFR1, FRS2, MEK and ERK in W1 cells in vitro. LEN inhibited in vivo tumor growth and decreased microvessel density (MVD) in 5 human DTC xenografts. LEN decreased phosphorylation of FRS2, which a substrate FGFR, in W1 xenografts.MTC\", ' TT cells were reported to have activated mutation in RET. The IC50 value of LEN was 0.078 M. Oral administration of LEN at dose of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg inhibited in vivo tumor growth but did not decrease MVD in TT xenograft model. LEN inhibited phosphorylation of RET within TT xenograft at the same doses to show antitumor activity. ATC', ' LEN did not show anti proliferative activity against 5 ATC cells in vitro (IC50 value > 10 M). LEN showed the both antitumor and antiangiogenic activity in 5 ATC xenografts.Conclusion', ' LEN showed the antitumor activity in 11 human thyroid cancer xenografts through antiangiogenic activity based on inhibition of VEGFR2 whereas inhibition of FGFR and RET signaling pathway contributes antitumor activity of LEN in some of DTC and MTC preclinical models. These data suggest that LEN provides therapeutic benefits in various human thyroid cancer models through VEGFR/FGFR/RET inhibitory activity.']",
