Preclinical and Phase 1 clinical data show the drug has minimal activity in tumors lacking BRAF mutations, creating a need for an accurate diagnostic test to identify appropriate patients for therapy. Methods', ' To assess eligibility for BRIM-2, a Phase 2 trial of V in patients with BRAFV600 mutation-positive metastatic melanoma,  tumor samples were screened with an investigational PCR assay (cobas 4800 BRAF  V600 Mutation Test) designed to detect the canonical V600E (1799T>A) mutation. 328 samples were tested of which 327 samples gave valid results. BRAF mutations were detected in 184 (56.3 %); 132 patients with BRAF-mutation positive melanoma were enrolled into the trial based on clinical eligibility criteria. Sanger sequencing was performed retrospectively on DNA samples from all  enrolled patients. Results', ' Fifteen samples (11.4%) gave invalid Sanger results. Sanger detected a V600E mutation in 97 samples (73.5%), V600K mutation in 9 samples (6.8%)  and a wild-type (WT) result in 11 cases (8.3%). Samples were also subjected to deep sequencing with a quantitative picotiter plate pyrosequencing method (454 GS-Titanium) to resolve differences between PCR and Sanger results. Using 454 sequencing of  samples with invalid Sanger results revealed a V600E mutation in 14 cases and a V600K mutation in 1 case. Of 11 samples with a WT Sanger result, 454 sequencing detected a V600E mutation in all cases, with a median percentage of mutant alleles of 8%;  ten of the 11 samples had a percentage < 25%. The presence of a V600K mutation was confirmed by 454 sequencing in all 9 samples identified as having V600K mutations by Sanger. Conclusions', ' 1) the investigational PCR test had a low failure rate; 2) the PCR test was more sensitive in the detection of V600E mutations than Sanger sequencing, which may miss mutations in cases with low % mutant alleles; 3) the PCR test detects V600K mutations, and 4) in all 132 cases, a codon 600 mutation was confirmed by Sanger and/or 454 sequencing. Robust, rapid and accurate molecular testing was achieved in this multi-center clinical trial.']",

However, the inter and intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity for BRAF status has been described supporting the need for testing multiple sites for the same patient. Circulating DNA is considered a promising non-invasive tool for cancer monitoring. The objective of our work was to determine the potential of plasma DNA to detect BRAF mutations, particularly in patients presenting discordant BRAF status from different tumor sites.  Methods', '  Plasma DNA was extracted using the iPrep PureLink Virus Kit on an iPrep purification system (Invitrogen). BRAF mutations were detected using the Therascreen BRAF RGQ kit (Qiagen).  Results', '  Ninety-nine patients were included, and plasma was collected at baseline. Nine stage III melanoma patients presenting a mutant BRAF (6 V600E, 2 V600K and 1 V600D) were tested and for 4 of them we detected the corresponding mutation (including the V600D and both V600K) in circulating DNA (sensitivity 44.4 %). Similarly, 20 stage IV patients were tested (17 V600E, 2 V600K and 1 V600R). The corresponding mutation (including the V600R and both V600K) was detected in 15 of these patients (sensitivity 75.0%). Interestingly, 4 stage IV patients included in our series presented discordant BRAF mutation status on different sites (1 patient with a WT primary tumor (PT) and a V600E lymph node (LN) metastasis; 1 patient with a V600E PT and WT LN metastasis; 2 patients with a V600E PT, V600E LN and WT liver metastasis). We were able to detect the expected BRAF mutation in circulating DNA for all these patients.  Conclusions', '  The sensitivity of our procedure, based on approved kits, suggests a high interest for use in clinical practice, even for non-V600E mutations. Plasma DNA might be less sensitive to heterogeneity between tumor samples, and therefore might represent an interesting alternative source of DNA to detect BRAF mutations in clinical setting.']",

BRAF mutations have been identified approximately 50% of melanoma. V600 mutations increase BRAF kinase activity promoting melanoma growth. Approximately 90% of all identified BRAF mutations are V600E and 5%-12% are V600K amino acid substitutions. Targeted agents that inhibit BRAF kinase activity have improved progression-free survival when used in BRAF mutant melanoma. RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways are key players in melanoma progression and drug resistance. CLART CMA BRAF-MEK1-AKT1 is a novel diagnostic assay to evaluate the BRAF V600E/K mutation in order to screen patients for treatment with inhibitor of BRAF kinase activity. Moreover this is able to identify mutations in MEK1 and AKT1 genes that could be related with resistance to inhibitors of BRAF kinase activity. Methods', ' Specific ARMS-primers and hybridization probes for detecting mutations BRAF V600E and V600K, MEK1 I111S, P124S and E203K, and AKT1 Q79K were designed. Clinical testing was performed using 155 samples which contained the targets of this assay and samples with wild type alleles. The results were cross checked by comparison to Sanger sequencing methodology. Results', ' Analytical sensitivity was assessed using recombinant plasmids, results ranged in 1000 copies/l for the most prevalent BRAF V600E mutation. For the rest of mutations in BRAF, MEK1 and AKT1 results ranged in 10000 copies/l.

In these rare BRAF mutants, the effects of vemurafenib (Vem) and other MAPK pathway inhibitors on signaling, growth rate and clinical course are not well understood. In cell lines with rare BRAF mutations, we investigated the effect of Vem, inhibitors of Pan-RAF (Amgen 2112819), MEK (trametinib), ERK (MERK SCH772984), Pan-RAFi+ MEKi and ERKi+Vem on growth and signaling. These results were compared to the clinical responses to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in patients with the original tumors. Regardless of the mutation, no paradoxical activation of MAPK pathway by Vem was observed and the Pan-Rafi decreased levels of pMEK in all the cell lines. A heterozygous V600K mutated cell line was sensitive to Vem and more sensitive to the other drugs. Clinically, the duration of response to Vem in the patient the cell line was derived from was 7 months, and an additional 3 months to the combination of Vem and MEKi upon progression on Vem. In contrast, a homozygous V600K mutated cell line was resistant to Vem but sensitive to other MAPK inhibitors. The patient the cell line was derived from had a 5 month response to Vem followed by a 2 month response to the addition of a MEKi. BRAF L597S cell line was only sensitive to ERKi and G466K and V600R mutated cell lines were resistant to all the drugs. In general, Vem was the least effective followed by Pan-RAFi with ERKi stronger than both in most cell lines. The combination of Vem and ERKi showed similar or slightly higher growth inhibition than ERKi alone. In conclusion, MAPK inhibitors are not as effective in melanoma cell lines with rare BRAF mutations. However, more growth inhibition can be achieved by MEKi-Pan-RAFi combination.

Previous observations have additionally suggested that specific copy number profiles may be associated with BRAF, NRAS and WT/WT status. The randomized, phase III clinical trial E2603', ' carboplatin, paclitaxel, +/- sorafenib (CP vs. CPS) offers the largest available collection of tumor samples from patients with well annotated clinical outcome to evaluate these associations. We evaluated copy number variants (CNVs) using array Comparative Genomic Hybridization in melanoma tumor samples from patients treated on this trial. Genomic DNA was hybridized on SurePrint G4 human CGH microarrays 2 x 440 K (Agilent). Copy number gains and losses were  0.3 or  -0.3 on a log2 scale, respectively (Nexus BioDiscovery, Inc). In 119 melanoma tumor samples, 45% had BRAF mutations, 24% NRAS mutations, and 24% without either (designated WT), CNVs were evaluated in an initial set of 26 genes known to be involved in melanoma pathogenesis. Overall genomic instability, as measured by number of genes with CNVs, was associated with poor ECOG performance status (P=0.007) and marginally significant for more organs with metastatic involvement (P=0.06), and is consistent with other studies suggesting that genomic instability is a predictor of worsened outcome. We further explored the association between copy number and somatic mutation status. Not surprisingly, BRAF gene amplification was observed in 91% of BRAF mutant melanoma tumor samples (P<0.001, as compared to 66% of NRAS/WT samples). The average value of BRAF copy number was higher in tumor samples with BRAF V600K mutations compared to samples with BRAF V600E mutations (1.11 v 0.55, P<0.001). MET, also on chr 7, was found to be amplified in 59% of BRAF mutated melanoma tumor samples. The average value of MET copy number was also higher in BRAF V600K mutant compared to BRAF V600E mutant melanoma (0.53 v 0.27, P=0.04), which may contribute to the differing clinical behaviors of melanomas with the two mutations. Patients with BRAF copy number gain had a trend towards lower overall response rate to either treatment compared to diploid (15.2% v 29.6%, OR=0.37, P=0.08). Patients with NRAS copy number gain receiving CPS had significantly improved overall survival compared to patients receiving CP alone (HR=0.35, P=0.03) in multivariable Cox model. We had previously found a trend suggesting an improved clinical response and PFS in patients with NRAS mutant melanoma treated with CPS as compared to CP. Our present study demonstrates an association between CNVs and treatment response to CP or CPS, as well as an association with somatic mutations. In addition, distinct cooperating genomic events identified in somatic mutation cohorts, such as MET and BRAF V600K gain, may contribute to the pathogenesis of melanoma tumors.']",

        "Background":"['IntroductionActivating mutations in the BRAF gene are common in skin and colorectal tumors. In more than 90% of the cases, these mutations are located in the BRAF V600 codon (V600E and V600K). Targeted therapies like vemurafenib and dabrafenib have shown objective response rates in up to half of metastatic melanomas harboring these BRAF V600 mutations. Tumor mutation status is usually assessed starting from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue shavings. Typically, the test involves shipment of the paraffin block from the local pathology lab to a specialized molecular lab, where several steps need to be performed.MethodsThe Biocartis molecular diagnostics (MDx) prototype platform is a novel, random access, sample-in result-out automated qPCR system. It uses a disposable cartridge which can simultaneously detect and quantify up to 30 molecular markers from a wide range of solid and liquid sample types, including blood, feces, and sputum. For FFPE-based assays, a single curl or shaving is directly placed into the cartridge. The complete process time for sample preparation, PCR and reporting is less than 90 min, with <2 minutes hands-on time. We hereby present a concordance study of the Biocartis BRAF V600 Mutation prototype assay (which detects BRAF V600E, V600K, V600R, V600E2, V600D and V600M) with the Roche cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test (Cobas). Sixty-four FFPE samples from melanoma and other tumors, with varying amounts of melanin, % tumor, and % BRAF V600 mutated tumor cells were randomly selected and tested. Both the Biocartis MDx prototype platform and the Biocartis BRAF V600 Mutation prototype assay were used for research use only purposes. Deep sequencing was performed using MiSeq (Illumina) with over 5,000-fold coverage and sensitivity of 1% of minority species for each sample.ResultsOne sample was not eligible for Cobas testing because of low tumor content. Three other samples failed on both platforms. For the remaining 60 samples, results on the Biocartis MDx platform and Cobas were concordant in 58 (96.7%) samples (44 BRAF V600 WT and 14 BRAF V600 mutant samples, of which 36 samples were randomly selected and confirmed by deep sequencing). In 2 (3.3%) samples, no BRAF V600 mutation was detected by Cobas, while a BRAF V600 mutation was detected by both the Biocartis MDx platform and by deep sequencing. Both were melanoma samples (one of which was highly pigmented), excised in 1993 and 2005, and contained 4.6% V600E and 5.6% V600K (as determined by deep sequencing), respectively.ConclusionsThe new MDx platform is a fast and reliable method for BRAF V600 mutation testing directly on FFPE tumor shavings with superior analytical sensitivity, ease of use, and turnaround time compared to existing diagnostic tests. The BRAF V600 Mutation prototype assay provided excellent concordance with both Cobas (96.7%) and deep sequencing (100%).']",

The QS3D digital PCR system concluded on the presence of a BRAF mutation in only 20/34 samples (PPA = 58.8%) mostly because of an insufficient number of circulating DNA copies to reach a relevant statistic value. Conclusions', ' The Qiagen and the Entrogen assays are based on allele-specific amplification, a technique easy to use without a specific training, unlike dPCR which requires specific equipment and training to acquire technical and interpretation skills. The unexpectedly low PPA of dPCR was attributed to the limited amount of DNA extracted from some samples. These findings suggest that the Qiagen and Entrogen plasma tests are more adapted as a screening tool for non-invasive assessment of BRAF mutation in metastatic melanoma but could be complemented with dPCR as an absolute quantification tool for follow-up.

Here, we report 5-y landmark analyses for BREAK-2 and BREAK-3. Methods', ' BREAK-2, a single-arm, phase 2 study, evaluated dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily in pts with stage IV BRAF V600E/Kmutant MM. BREAK-3, an open-label, randomized (3', '1), phase 3 study, assessed dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily vs dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks in pts with previously untreated BRAFV600Emutant unresectable stage III or stage IV MM. Updated analyses were performed to describe  5-y outcomes in each study. Results', ' BREAK-2 enrolled 92 pts (V600E, n = 76; V600K, n = 16), of whom most (90%) had prior systemic anticancer therapy. At data cutoff (17 Jun 2016), all pts had discontinued, mostly due to progression (84%). In V600E pts, 5-y progression-free survival (PFS) was 11%, and 5-y overall survival (OS) was 20%. Postprogression immunotherapy was received by 22% of enrolled pts. In BREAK-3 (data cutoff, 16 Sep 2016), median follow-up was 18.6 mo for the dabrafenib arm (n = 187) and 12.8 mo for the dacarbazine arm (n = 63). Follow-up for the 37 dacarbazine-arm pts (59%) who crossed over to receive dabrafenib was based on the initial assignment of dacarbazine. The 5-y PFS was 12% vs 3% and 5-y OS was 24% vs 22% for the dabrafenib and dacarbazine arms, respectively. A subset of pts in each respective arm received postprogression antiCTLA-4 (24% vs 24%) and/or antiPD-1 (8% vs 2%) therapy, whereas 31% vs 17% did not receive any further therapy following study treatment. No new safety signals were observed in either study with long-term follow-up. Additional characterization of pts using cfDNA analysis will be presented. Conclusions', ' These data provide the longest reported PFS and OS follow-up for BRAF inhibitor monotherapy in BRAF V600mutant MM.

        "Background":"['Background', ' The most common of all activating BRAF mutations (T1799A point mutation) leads to a substitution of valine (V) to glutamic acid (E) at the position 600 of the amino acid sequence. This oncogenic mutation in the BRAF gene constitutively activates the MAPK signaling pathway and results in increased proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. BRAF V600E mutation was described in approximately 8% of all solid tumors (43% melanomas, 39-67% papillary thyroid carcinomas and 12% colorectal adenocarcinomas). However, it is challenging to identify patients with this mutation. Currently, the gold standard is sequencing of the tumor DNA, but this method is not practical for routine practice. In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a relatively easy diagnostic tool to detect proteins in paraffin-embedded tissues. The major goal of this study was to compare detection of BRAF V600E by sequencing and IHC using anti-BRAF V600E (VE1) antibody. This clone is mutation specific and can distinguish the V600E mutation in BRAF from the wild type BRAF protein.Methods', \" Tissues from sixty-nine patients with colon cancer (N=40) and thyroid cancer (N=29) were evaluated for the BRAF V600E mutation. Genomic DNA was extracted from 20 m tissue sections and analyzed by PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing. Primers were designed to cover the BRAF coding sequences at mutation site and a few nucleotides in the intron on both ends (BRAF-ex15F-TGCTTGCTCTGATAGGAAAATG; BRAF-ex15R-AGCATCTCAGGGCCAAAAAT). Both forward and reverse strands were sequenced on an Applied Biosystem's 3730xl DNA Analyzer. Immunohistochemical staining using anti-BRAF V600E (VE1) antibody was done on VENTANA BenchMark XT platform with OptiView DAB IHC Detection Kit.Results\", ' All cases (22/22, 100%) that were negative for BRAF V600E mutation by IHC were confirmed to be BRAF V600E negative by sequencing. Out of 47 cases staining positive for BRAF V600E (VE1) 43 cases were confirmed by sequencing. Of the four discordant cases, one case was weakly positive by IHC (score 1), two cases that were negative by sequencing showed stronger BRAF V600E (VE1) staining (score 2) and one case contained a different mutation at codon 600 (V600K). Overall, there was high concordance between IHC and DNA sequencing. Using the sequencing as the reference standard, negative predictive value was 100%, positive predictive value was 91% with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 85%. Overall percentage agreement across all cases was 94% (65/69 cases). Next-generation sequencing will be used to evaluate discordant cases for BRAF V600 mutation status.Conclusion', ' Detection of the BRAF V600E mutation is emerging as an important biomarker with diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive potential. Importantly, our data suggests that there is high concordance between sequencing and IHC using anti-BRAF V600E (VE1) antibody.']",

        "Background":"['Dysregulation of ERK signaling is a common event in malignancy. Receptor activation of RAS leads to dimerization and activation of RAF kinase, which in turn activates ERK. Physiologic activation of the pathway is limited by ERK dependent feedback inhibition of RAS activation and other components of the pathway. Oncogenic mutations and translocations of RAF family members have been identified in many human tumors and serve as drivers of tumor growth. We now show that these mutants are active despite feedback inhibition of RAS and that this is associated with dysregulated ERK output. All translocations and almost all of the RAF mutants tested so far form RAS-independent constitutive dimers, the activity of which is dependent on their dimerization. Mutations at one site, V600E and V600K allow RAF to function as a monomer in cells with low RAS activity and as a RAS-dependent dimer in cells with adequate RAS activity. In tumors expressing any of these mutants, RAF/MEK/ERK activity is elevated despite feedback inhibition of RAS. Currently available RAF inhibitors bind to one protomer of the RAF dimer and cause negative cooperativity of binding to the second site. This is sometimes associated with transactivation of the unbound protomer. These inhibitors cannot be used to inhibit ERK signaling in tumors in which ERK is driven by RAF-dimers (those with mutant RAS, NF1 loss, atypical RAF mutations, RAF translocations.) In contrast, in tumors with V600E BRAF mutations, ERK causes strong feedback inhibition of RAS and V600E BRAF exists as a monomer that is inhibited by these drugs. Acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors usually results from a molecular lesion that causes RAS-dependent or independent dimerization of V600E (NRAS mutation, V600E BRAF amplification, V600E aberrantly spliced isoform.) Current RAF inhibitors inhibit V600E BRAF dimers at concentrations 10-100 fold greater than those required to inhibit the corresponding monomer in cells. We take this as a provisional measure of the degree of negative cooperativity of binding to the second site. We have now identified inhibitors that inhibit V600E dimers at concentrations close (1-3 fold higher) than those required to inhibit the monomer. They do not cause dissociation of dimers and their inhibition is abolished by gatekeeper mutations. Phenotypically, therefore, binding of these compounds to dimers is associated with only minimal negative cooperativity. These drugs inhibit ERK signaling and the proliferation of tumor cells with atypical BRAF mutations and translocations as well as V600E melanoma models with acquired resistance to Vemurafenib. However, they are much less active in cancer cells with KRAS mutation or receptor-dependent activation of RAF. Selective inhibitors of subsets of RAF dimers may allow effective ERK inhibition of large subset of tumors without inhibiting signaling in normal cells.']",
