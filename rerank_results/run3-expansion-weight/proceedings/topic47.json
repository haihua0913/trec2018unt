In-vitro studies suggest that loss of PTEN expression and resulting PI3K pathway activation drive cholesterol ester accumulation in aggressive prostate cancers through sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and acyl coenzyme A-cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT1) activity. In two prospective cohorts, we studied whether lower PTEN expression is associated with cholesterol metabolism and how this relates to lethal prostate cancer.METHODS', ' We analyzed men with prostate cancer from the prospective prostatectomy Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Physicians Health Study. 105 men had lethal cancer and 284 men non-lethal disease without metastases at 8 years of follow-up. Whole-transcriptome mRNA expression profiling data was available from diagnostic prostate tumor specimens. Linear regression models were used to assess continuous and categorical associations, and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of lethal prostate cancer.RESULTS', ' Both lower PTEN and higher SQLE expression were associated with higher Gleason grade (p trend < 0.001 each).

SREBF2 was correlated with SQLE (r = 0.33, p < 0.001) but not with ACAT1 (r = -0.01, p = 0.8). Low PTEN was associated with lethal cancer (OR, 1.50 per 1 standard deviation [SD] decrease; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.87; p = 0.001). High SQLE was associated with lethal cancer (OR 2.13 per 1 SD increase, 95% CI, 1.63 to 2.79; p < 0.001). SREBF1, SREBF2, and ACAT1 were not associated with lethal cancer (all p > 0.05).

In this study, we demonstrate that Pten-depleted cells suffer from mitotic stress, and that nuclear function of Pten, but not its phosphastase activity, is required to reverse this stress phenotype. Further, depletion of Pten results in elevated expression of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a key regulator of the cell cycle. We found that elevated Plk1 is critical for Pten-depleted cells to adapt to mitotic stress for survival, and that re-introduction of wild-type Pten into Pten-null prostate cancer cells reduces the survival dependence on Plk1. We further show that Plk1 confers the tumorigenic competence of Pten-deleted prostate cancer cells in a mouse xenograft model. In order to evaluate the clinical relevance of our finding, we examined the expression level of Plk1 in human prostate cancer tissue assay which includes normal tissue samples, prostate hyperplasia samples and malignant tumor samples. A correlation between overexpression of Plk1 and genetic inactivation of Pten was observed during prostate neoplasia formation.

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men. Protein kinase C epsilon (PKC), a member of the PKC family of phorbol ester/diacylglycerol receptors, has been shown to be up-regulated in human prostate cancer specimens. We recently demonstrated that mice that specifically overexpress PKC in prostate under the control of the probasin promoter (PB-PKC) develop hyperplasia and PIN lesions. However, PKC overexpression was insufficient to drive neoplastic changes in the mouse prostate. In the present study our goal was to determine whether PKC overexpression can cooperate with Pten deficiency, one of the most common genetic alterations in human prostate cancer. We stably overexpressed PKC in two pairs of isogenic mouse prostate epithelial lines that are either heterozygous (P2, P8) or homozygous (CaP2, CaP8) for Pten deletion. PKC overexpression led to significant enhancement in cell proliferation compared to the respective control cells and this effect is more pronounced in CaP2 or CaP8 cells. Moreover, assays of colony formation in liquid medium revealed that anchorage-dependent growth was augmented in PKC-overexpressing cells relative to control cells. A significant elevation in phospho-Akt levels was observed in PKC overexpressing cells relative to respective controls. To further elucidate the cooperativity between PKC overexpression and Pten loss we intercrossed the PB-PKC transgenic mice and Pten+/ mice. Strikingly, the resulting compound mutant mice overexpressing PKC and haploinsufficient for Pten (PB-PKC; Pten+/) developed fully invasive adenocarcinoma at 12 months of age. Very strong phospho-Akt, phospho-S6 and phospho mTOR staining could be detected in adenocarcinomas from PB-PKC; Pten+/ mice. Furthermore, we detected enhanced p-Erk, Cox-2, STAT3, NF-B and cyclin D1 signaling in adenocarcinomas from PB-PKC;Pten+/ mice than in lesions from each monogenic model. These data thus suggest that PKC overexpression cooperates with a defined oncogenic input to promote prostate tumorigenesis. These findings also suggest a crucial role of PKC in survival.']",

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men, other than skin cancer, in the United States. When the cancer enters into the metastatic castration resistant stage (mCRPC), few treatment options are currently available and the disease is considered incurable. The purpose of this study is to investigate a new, targeted therapy against prostate cancers, including mCRPC. Talazoparib is a novel PARP inhibitor with up to 100-fold higher potency and PARP affinity when compared to PARP inhibitors such as olaparib, veliparib, and rucaparib. Current literature suggests that PTEN mutants have high sensitivity to talazoparib. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that is commonly lost in prostate cancers. A murine prostate cancer cell line, Myc-CaP, which has been modified to overexpress the oncogene Myc, was edited by the CRISPR-Cas9 system to knock out the PTEN gene. Myc-CaP and Myc-CaP PTEN KO cells were treated with olaparib, an FDA approved, first generation PARP inhibitor, and talazoparib. Talazoparib decreased cell viability significantly more in PTEN KO cells versus PTEN wild-type (WT) cells. No such trend was observed when these cells were treated with olaparib. In addition, IC50 values in prostate cancer cell lines with heterozygous or homozygous deletion of PTEN were up to 20 times lower with the talazoparib treatment when compared to olaparib. Not only does this indicate that talazoparib is much more potent than olaparib, but also preferentially impairs cell growth in PTEN mutants. PTEN’s signal transduction prevents the phosphorylation of AKT, which is necessary for cell proliferation. When cells were treated with an AKT inhibitor, MK2206, alone or in combination with talazoparib, pAKT protein levels decreased, but the greatest effect was seen when MK2206 was used in combination with a low dose of talazoparib in the Myc-Cap cell line with wt PTEN. Western blot analysis showed that PTEN was upregulated following talazoparib treatment. These results indicate synergy of talazoparib and MK2206 in reducing the phosphorylation of AKT in a dose-dependent manner. Talazoparib is by far the most potent PARP inhibitor developed to date. With talazoparib potentially acting on prostate cancer with PTEN mutations, talazoparib treatment may expand current PARP inhibitor treatment in advanced prostate cancers and thereby elicit a response in as many as 80% of patients. Thus, talazoparib has vast therapeutic potential in prostate cancer.']",

We have used genetically engineered mouse models of prostate cancer to show the treatment efficacy of monotherapy with the AKT inhibitor AZD5363 and the MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY142886). We hypothesized that a rational combinatorial approach utilizing both of these inhibitors would improve treatment efficacy compared to single agent monotherapy. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the treatment effects of AZD5363 and selumetinib in preclinical models of prostate cancer. In vitro experiments were carried out using a panel of human prostate cancer cell lines, and mouse prostate cancer cell lines, derived from PTEN-deficient castration-nave prostate cancer (CNPC) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Treatments with AZD5363 and selumetinib demonstrated a synergistic combination effect in both human and mouse prostate cancer cell lines. We evaluated the antitumor effects in vivo by comparing the effects of AZD5363 and selumetinib alone or in combination in PTEN-deficient mice. Our studies show that combination therapy of AZD5363/selumetinib was well-tolerated by the mice and demonstrated significantly improved inhibition of tumor growth compared to single agent therapy. In the CNPC model, mice showed 16.7, 10.0 and 24.9% reductions in tumor burden after treatments with AZD5363, selumetinib and AZD5363/selumetinib, respectively (P<0.001).

Establishing immunocompetent and clinically relevant models that predict treatment response is essential for the development of novel immunotherapies. To gain better insights into the preclinical evaluation of novel immunotherapeutic strategies, we used genetically engineered mouse models of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer. We first analyzed the transcriptome in castration-naïve prostate tumors and the progression to castration-resistant disease. Comparative analyses were performed between age-matched normal prostate and PTEN-/- prostate tumor samples from castration-naïve mice and, at 4 weeks (castration-sensitive) and 10 weeks (castration-resistant) post-surgical castration. Pathway and gene-set enrichment analysis indicated that abnormal tumor immunity was strongly associated with the progression to castration resistance. Chemokine signaling, B cell receptor and T cell receptor signaling pathways were among the top dysregulated pathways, and gene signatures of suppressed tumor immunity were enriched in castration-resistant tumors. Higher expression patterns of the programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) were observed in castration-resistant tumors compared to castration-naïve tumors. We also characterized immune expression profiles in more aggressive tumors from PTEN/P53 double knockout (DKO) mice. PD-L1 was strongly expressed cancer cells, but a higher presence of PD-1+, CD45+ and F4/80+ stromal infiltrating immune cells in was observed in castration-resistant tumors. PD-1/PD-L1 blockade with antibodies against mouse PD-L1 increased CD45+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in an early model of PTEN/P53-deficient castration-resistant prostate cancer. PTEN/P53-DKO mice with advanced castration-naïve prostate cancer tended to experienced longer overall survival after treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade compared to vehicle and isotype controls, median survival 23, 14 and 11 days, respectively, P=0.458. A higher number of CD45+ TILs was observed in tumors of mice receiving the anti-PD-L1 treatment. Interim analysis of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade on a model of advanced PTEN/P53-deficient castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has thus far shown that mice receiving treatment experience significantly longer survival (P=0.017, median survival not yet reached). Our findings show that castration-resistance promotes tumor immune suppression in mouse PTEN-deficient prostate cancer and suggest that this phenomenon can be reversed pharmacologically with anti-PD-L1 blockade.

Novel therapeutic strategies targeting the alternative splicing machinery are being developed and tested. Here, characterized the conditional PTEN-deficient mouse model of prostate cancer to determine its relevancy as preclinical tool for the development and efficacy determination of novel therapeutic strategies targeting aberrant alternative splicing.

Clustering analysis revealed genes enriched with the functions involved in mRNA splicing and processing in mice with prostate tumors. Moreover, alternative splicing events were more prevalent in castration-sensitive tumors (>2.5-fold) compared to castration-nave and castration resistant tumors. Exon skipping (cassette exon), was the most common splicing event observed in all conditions. Additionally, alternative splicing was observed in several genes frequently associated with human prostate cancer including CD44, AR, p53, Bcl2l1 and Klf6 among others.

To detect ERG rearrangement and PTEN deletion simultaneously, we developed a four-color multiplex ISH assay using non-organic quantum dots (QD).

The automated QD ISH assay allows adequate delivery of QDs to nuclear targets and reproducible detection of ERG and PTEN gene targets.

Protein kinase C epsilon (PKC), a member of the PKC family of phorbol ester/diacylglycerol receptors, has emerged as an oncogenic kinase and shown to be up-regulated in human prostate cancer specimens. We recently demonstrated that PKC is an upstream regulator of NF-B activation in prostate cancer (JBC, 287', '37570-37582, 2012) and that transgenic overexpression of PKC in mice prostate under the control of the probasin promoter (PB-PKC) leads to hyperplasia and PIN lesions but was insufficient to drive neoplastic changes (Cell Cycle, 10', '268-277, 2011). Notably, when we intercrossed PB-PKC mice with mice haploinsufficient for Pten, another common genetic alteration in human prostate cancer, the resulting compound mutant mice (PB-PKC;Pten+/- mice) developed fully invasive adenocarcinoma with elevated NF-B levels. In the present study, we aim to delineate the mechanism underlying the observed cooperativity between PKC overexpression and Pten deficiency and to explore the consequences of this cooperativity on the transcription factor NF-B signaling, a pathway known to be highly dysregulated in prostate tumorigenesis. To this end, we stably overexpressed PKC in mouse prostate epithelial lines that are either heterozygous (P8) or homozygous (CaP8) for Pten deletion. We observed a striking synergism between PKC overexpression and Pten loss in conferring enhanced proliferative, migratory and invasive phenotype. Moreover, LPS or TNF stimulation of these cells led to increased NF-B activation as evident from the elevated IB phosphorylation, NF-B nuclear translocation and transactivation of a NF-B luciferase reporter. These effects were much more pronounced in CaP8 cells. Of note, PKC overexpression and Pten loss also cooperates to augment levels of the NF-B regulated gene, COX-2. Stable overexpression of PKC and Pten depletion in normal immortalized RWPE1 cells also resulted in significant enhancements in TNF-induced NF-B activation and COX-2 induction. Furthermore, NF-B inhibition by parthenolide significantly retarded the growth of CaP8-PKC tumors in athymic nude mice.

Conditional inactivation of both PTEN and P53 results in the development of aggressive tumors compared to PTEN K/O mice. Homozygous PTEN/P53-mutants mice grow prostate tumors at a faster rate and experience dramatically reduced survival. Homozygous double K/O mice also developed a higher frequency and number of metastases. Furthermore, haploinsufficient P53 gain of function mutations contributed to an invasive cancer phenotype compared to P53 loss of function haploinsufficient tumors.

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in males after lung cancer in the USA. Under normal conditions, the essential role of androgen through the androgen receptor (AR) is to support prostate epithelial cell growth, functional differentiation and survival. However, the androgen and AR-mediated signaling pathways can also promote genesis, progression and metastasis of prostate cancer. Thus, androgen deprivation or abrogation of the AR signaling remains the first-line treatment for human advanced prostate cancer. Unfortunately, these prostate cancers develop resistance to these therapies and progress to androgen-independent or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with an average latency period of 18 months. Docetaxel chemotherapy and newly developed androgen synthesis blocker or AR signaling inhibitors have been demonstrated to be efficacious against CRPC. However, the median increase in survival was only four to five months. Thus, identification of molecular targets contributing to the initiation and progression of CRPC is a critical step to develop effective mechanism-based prostate cancer therapies. Recent studies provided compelling genetic evidence that Pten deletion, the most frequent genetic alterations identified in 70% of human advanced prostate cancers, promotes PCa progression to CRPC in preclinical mouse models. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying Pten deletion-driven CRPC, we established an AR-positive prostate cancer cell line derived from an aggressive prostate tumor developed in a genetic mouse model carrying deletion of Pten only in prostate epithelium. Our initial characterization studies show that these cancer cells proliferated and grew well in an anchorage-independent growth assay either in the absence of androgen or genetic depletion of AR in vitro. In support of this notion, we found that these cancer cells formed tumors in female NOD/SCID IL2RG null mice. Interestingly, the tumors grow faster and larger in female NOD/SCID IL2RG null mice than in their male counterparts. These observations promoted us to further examine the role of estrogen in the development of CRPC. Genetic and pharmacologic studies suggested that estrogen, through its receptor alpha (ER)-FOXA1-mediated signaling pathway, increased cancer cell proliferation in vitro and promoted prostate tumor development in xenografts in female SCID mice. Furthermore, we found that these cancer cells display features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as characterized by the loss of E-cadherin and CK8 coupled with an increase in N-cadherin, vimentin, and twist expression. Collectively, our data suggest that (ER)-FOXA1-mediated signaling pathway and EMT play an important role in Pten deficiency-driven CRPC.

To determine the prevalence and clinical significance of different mechanisms of PTEN inactivation, we analyzed 4,699 hormone-nave and 57 hormone-refractory prostate cancers by fluorescence in situ hybridization for PTEN deletion. In addition, PTEN mutations and promoter methylation were analyzed in subsets of 149 and 34 tumors. PTEN deletions were present in 20.2% (458/2,266) of prostate cancers harboring and heterozygous (8.1%) and homozygous (12.1%) deletions. Deletions of PTEN were linked to advanced tumor stage (p<0.0001), high Gleason grade (p<0.0001), presence of lymph-node metastasis (p=0.0002), hormone refractory disease (p<0.0001), presence of ERG gene fusion (p<0.0001), and nuclear p53 accumulation (p<0.0001). PTEN deletions were also associated with early PSA recurrence in univariate (p<0.0001) and multivariate analysis (p=0.0158) if compared to the established risk factors pT stage, Gleason grade, and preoperative PSA level. The PTEN deletion had the identical prognostic impact in both in ERG fusion-positive and -negative tumors. PTEN mutations were found in 4 of 26 (15%) of cancers with heterozygous PTEN deletion, but in only 1 of 59 (2%) of cancers without PTEN deletion (p=0.0183). Analysis of the PTEN promoter for methylation changes in 34 tumors revealed no aberrations. The results of this study demonstrate that biallelic inactivation of PTEN, either by homozygous deletion or by deletion of one allele and mutation of the second one, occurs in the majority of prostate cancers with PTEN alteration and is characteristic feature for a particularly aggressive subset of metastatic and hormone-refractory prostate cancers.']",

STAT3 can promote CRPC growth by activating the androgen receptor signaling pathway. It can also promote survival by modulating tumor cell proliferation, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and immune response. However, recent preclinical data suggests that STAT3 may also act as a tumor suppressor in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of AZD1480, a potent JAK1/2 inhibitor, in genetically engineered mouse models of prostate cancer driven by the loss of PTEN and PTEN/P53. In vivo pharmacodynamic studies using conditional PTEN-deficient mice demonstrated that AZD1480 strongly inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation. Moreover, AZD1480 monotherapy in PTEN-deficient mice harboring castration-nave or castration-resistant prostate tumors resulted in tumor growth reductions of 24.8%, P<0.001 and 15.8%, P<0.001, respectively, compared to vehicle treated control mice. Mice treated with AZD1480 also exhibited reduced levels of tumor cell proliferation and microvessel density, and increased apoptosis compared to controls.

Although aberrant ATF3 expression was often found in human cancers, the role of ATF3 in tumorigenesis is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that ATF3 suppresses the development of prostate cancer induced by knockout of the tumor suppressor Pten in mouse prostates. Whereas oncogenic stress caused by Pten loss induced ATF3 expression in prostate epithelium, we found that ATF3 deficiency increased cell proliferation but inhibited apoptosis, leading to early onset of mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and the progression of prostate lesions to invasive adenocarcinoma. Importantly, loss of ATF3 appeared to promote activation of the oncogenic AKT signaling evidenced by high levels of phosphorylated AKT and S6 proteins in ATF3-null prostate lesions. In line with these in vivo results, knockdown of ATF3 expression in human prostate cancer cells by sgRNA-mediated targeting activated AKT, elevated NF-KB nuclear translocation and increased expression of a broad of matrix metalloproteinase such as MMP-9, MMP-10. By zymography and q-PCR assays, we found that MMP-9 expression increased in ATF3-knockdown DU145 and PC3 cells. Also from luciferase reporter result, we further confirmed that loss of ATF3 could elevate MMP-9 expression via activating NF-KB. And in vivo immunochemistry results also show increased MMP9 expression and discontinuous a-SMA staining along prostate glands. These results were well anticipated that ATF3 deficiency leads to activated AKT signaling, which further activates IKK-A to increase nuclear translocation of NF-KB, which in turn binds to the MMP-9 promoter and induces MMP-9 expression in ATF3-downregulated prostate cancer cells, then promotes invasion in Pten-lost mouse prostates. Our results thus link ATF3 to the AKT signaling, and provide the first genetic evidence supporting that ATF3 is a tumor suppressor for a subset of prostate cancers harboring dysfunctional Pten.']",

AZD5363 has demonstrated strong anti-tumor activity against human prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Genetically engineered mouse models mimic the genetic and biological evolution of human prostate cancer and address deficiencies encountered with xenograft models.

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer (PCa) is a heterogeneous disease and the development of a molecular classification is critical to distinguish lethal from indolent tumors and reduce overtreatment. Genomic alterations of the PTEN and ETS genes (e.g., ERG) are among the most common in PCa and there is a huge interest in exploiting these alterations for risk assessment. We have found that PTEN loss is associated with PCa death most strongly in patients whose tumors do not carry an ERG rearrangement, contradicting findings from mouse models.Despite technological advances have enabled extraordinary insight into PCa molecular alterations, our understanding of the interaction between PTEN and ETS genes during PCa progression remains very limited. Hence, we have analyzed a large collection of multi-omics datasets to characterize the molecular underpinnings of PTEN loss in the context of ETS-negative versus ETS-positive tumors and further investigate their role in driving PCa prognosis.First we have developed a classification approach for PCa stratification based on dichotomized gene expression of PTEN and ETS family members. We have then validated this approach using TCGA DNA copy number variation and rearrangement status information. Our results confirmed that transcriptome analysis can be used for detecting PTEN and ETS alterations, and that in the absence of ERG rearrangements, tumors with PTEN loss frequently overexpress alternative ETS genes.Next, we examined whether somatic mutation profiles might differ by PTEN/ETS status, providing an potential explanation for the lethal behavior of ERG-negative/PTEN-negative tumors. As expected SPOP mutation was found to be mutually exclusive with ERG expression, but it did not vary significantly by PTEN status. Most interestingly, TP53 mutation - the most frequently altered gene in lethal metastatic PCa - was significantly enriched among PTEN-negative tumors irrespective to ERG- status. Collectively these findings suggest that known prognosis-driving somatic mutations do not explain the aggressive behavior of ERG-negative/PTEN-negative tumors.Finally, we analyzed differential gene expression associated with PTEN loss in the presence or absence of ERG gene expression and identified the associated biological processes and signaling pathways. This analysis failed to confirm the correlation between ERG/ETV1 expression and higher androgen signaling output previously reported in murine models. Furthermore, our findings revealed that MYC targets and the genes involved in cell cycle progression are the most up-regulated by PTEN loss in ETS-negative tumors, while genes involved in cell differentiation, response to DNA damage, and TNF signaling are the most induced by PTEN loss in ERG-positive tumors.Overall, our analysis clarified some important aspects of the role of PTEN/ETS network in PCa progression, suggesting a number of promising targets for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.']",

        "Background":"[\"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer and a major cause of cancer related deaths in men in North America. The phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) is frequently inactivated in PCa. Approximately 40% of primary and 70% of metastatic PCa's have genomic alterations in the PI3K-signaling, mostly through the loss of PTEN. Majority of metastatic PCa associated with PTEN loss are treated with docetaxel; an FDA approved therapy for recurrent PCa. However, in PTEN null PCa docetaxel treatment enhances senescence and does not significantly impact tumor volume. These findings were further confirmed in PCa patients with decreased levels of PTEN. In order to understand the global impact of docetaxel in PTEN null PCa we performed an unbiased RNA-seq of prostate tissues harvested from docetaxel treated prostate specific PTEN null mice. Data analysis showed strong enrichment of chromatin modifying enzymes reactome, mainly PRC2 as one of the top ranked categories. Among them EZH2, an oncogenic methyltransferase was found to be significantly upregulated. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed statistically significant upregulation of EZH2 in docetaxel treated mice compared to vehicle control. EZH2 upregulation was independent of androgen levels as both androgen dependent and independent cells showed striking upregulation of EZH2 when treated with docetaxel. Next, we confirmed the nature of the upregulated EZH2 (catalytic or non-catalytic) by docetaxel. EZH2 methyltransferase activity assay data showed significant induction of methyltransferase activity by docetaxel in both androgen dependent and independent conditions and in PTEN null mouse tissues. Further, we measured other methyltransferase marks i.e. H3K27me1&2, H3K4me3, H3K9me3 in the presence of docetaxel and found only specific upregulation of H3K27me3, confirming upregulation of only catalytic EZH2 by docetaxel. These data suggested a need for co-targeting EZH2 during docetaxel treatment in PTEN null PCa conditions. In order to provide a proof-of-principle we performed a tumor xenograft study in nude mice implanted with PTEN null PC3 cells. Combination of DZNeP (an EZH2 inhibitor) and docetaxel significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to each agent alone. Results obtained from the xenograft studies prompted us to perform a preclinical study in prostate specific PTEN null mice. Data obtained from this study clearly showed a significant reduction in number of high grade lesions in PTEN null tumors in combination group when compared to either docetaxel or DZNeP treated mice. We also observed clearance of senescent cells and accumulation of CD8+ T cells and classical dendritic (CD8+ Clec9a+ positive) cells. Our data suggests the necessity of designing a combination therapy of targeting EZH2 during docetaxel treatment specifically, which will likely increase the efficacy of docetaxel in PTEN null PCa.\"]",

Inhibition of both 5alpha-reducatase enzymes with dutasteride was effective in reducing the incidence of prostate cancer in high risk patients. This suggests that suppression of DHT with dutasteride may have a potential therapeutic effect on prostate cancer. In this study, we examined the antitumor effects of dutasteride in vivo using a preclinical model of prostate cancer that is based on the PSA-Cre mediated inactivation of PTEN. Our findings show that monotherapy with dutasteride significantly inhibited prostate tumor growth by approximately 25%. Furthermore, the combination of dutasteride with the mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, improved tumor growth suppression compared to monotherapy with either drug. Treatment with dutasteride had a minimal effect on tumor cell proliferation; however, it significantly increased the apoptotic rate in tumors. Interestingly, treatment with dutasteride resulted in increased activation of PI3K/mTOR signaling and a reduction of STAT3 pathway activation. Moreover, increased activation of MAPK, which occurs after treatment with mTOR inhibitors, was effectively reduced with the co-administration of dutasteride.

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Chemokines are a family of cytokines known to regulate the migration of cells. The chemokine CXCL12, also known as SDF-1, and its receptor CXCR4 are associated with prostate cancer bone metastasis. The tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) is a critical regulator of growth factors and inhibitor of PI3K. Loss of PTEN is frequently observed in cancer, resulting in the deregulation of cell survival, growth, and proliferation. Previous studies have found that PTEN is lost or mutated in 30-80% of primary prostate cancer, and 50% of prostate cancer bone metastases. In mouse models of prostate cancer, it has been shown that loss of PTEN is critical for tumor initiation, and the level of PTEN expression is inversely associated with prostate tumorigenesis. Murine epithelial cells from PTEN-deficient prostate tumors also display increased expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12. We hypothesize that loss of PTEN and subsequent activation of Akt, frequent occurrences in prostate cancer, regulate the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis in prostate cancer progression.Methods', ' Prostate-specific deletion of floxed exon 5 of PTEN was achieved by Cre recombinase expressed under the control of an androgen-responsive probasin promoter. Stable cell lines were developed from PTEN+/+, PTEN+/, and PTEN/ murine prostate epithelial cells isolated from prostates of corresponding mice at 8 weeks of age. PTEN status in these cell lines was confirmed by genotyping and immunoblot analyses. Human prostate cancer cell lines BPH-1, C4-2B, PC3, and DU145 were also utilized. Gene expression and invasion were analyzed in the presence or absence of Akt inhibitor. Additionally, DU145 with overexpressed HA-tagged Akt1 was also utilized in a subcutaneous injection model.Results', ' Loss of PTEN resulted in increased expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12, suggesting that loss of PTEN may play a key role in the regulation of these chemokines in prostate cancer. Upon treatment of PTEN-null cells with Akt inhibitor, the induction of CXCL12/CXCR4 was reversed, further demonstrating the role of the PTEN regulated pathway in the expression of these genes. Akt inhibition also resulted in decreased invasion in response to CXCL12. Overexpression of Akt1 in DU145 resulted increased CXCR4 expression, as well as increased proliferation and cell cycle progression. Subcutaneous injection of these cells also resulted in increased tumor growth as compared to neo controls.Conclusions', ' These results suggest the basis for activation of CXCL12 signaling through CXCR4 in prostate cancer driven by the loss of PTEN and subsequent activation of Akt.']",

We have shown in human tumor xenografts that the combination of IGF-IR inhibition with the human mab IMC-A12 in combination with androgen deprivation (ADT) was more efficacious than ADT alone. In a subsequent neoadjuvant study with IMC-A12, responses were at least as efficacious in hi-grade disease (Gleason 7 (4+3), 8, and 9) when compared to ADT alone. In order to determine predictors of response to IMC-A12 plus ADT (surgical castration) in human prostate cancer, we examined the response of 21 human prostate cancer xenografts (LuCaP series) grown in SCID mice for responses to castration, IMC-A12 40mg/kg ip 3x a week for four weeks, or castration followed by four weeks of IMC-A12. At the end of the IMC-A12 treatment animals were followed until tumor recurrence. When all animals were completed tumor growth was analyzed. The main differences in growth rates, as expected based on previous studies, occurred in mice receiving IMC-A12 plus castration compared to castration alone. Responses were segregated into three groups', ' Major Response - slope of tumor growth was negative in the IMC-A12 + Castration group compared to castration alone; Moderate Response - slope of combined treatment is flat and castration alone is positive; No-response - no differences in slope between castration and castration plus IMC-A12. We then examined the association of response to IMC-A12 to potential effectors of IGF-IR expression and signaling in the prostate including AR and AR splice variants and PTEN status. Tumor transcript profiles were generated on all xenografts prior to treatment and gene sets predictive of response determined. None of the PTEN null tumors showed a strong response to IMC-A12 and all PTEN null tumors expressed the AR-splice variant ARv567es. Of the 3 xenografts with one copy of PTEN, non- or partial responders either expressed no AR (neuroendocrine tumor) or expressed ARv567es. Of xenografts with 2 or more copies of PTEN, non- or moderate responders expressed AR-variants. Finally, transcript profiles provided a gene signature that was highly predictive of response to IMC-A12. These data indicate that PTEN insufficiency or the presence of an AR-splice variant that cannot increase IGF-IR via non-genomic activity are associated with resistance to IMC-A12. Further, a gene signature has been developed from the 21 xenografts that is predictive of response to IMC-A12 and castration.']",

The lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN negatively regulates the PI3Kinase-AKT signaling pathway, which controls numerous downstream targets such as cell cycle checkpoints, DNA damage repair with maintenance of chromosomal stability and integrity. ERG is a member of the ETS transcription factor family, whose members are implicated in numerous cellular processes including membrane remodelling, angiogenesis, differentiation, proliferation, and tumourigenesis. Emerging evidence suggests that formation of the fusion gene may promote prostatic tumourigenesis, progression, and invasive disease by elevating motility and invasiveness. The simultaneous manifestation of both PTEN loss and TMPRSS2', 'ERG fusion is associated with poor prognosis. This study is addressing pathways downstream of PTEN and effectors of ERG over-expression to identify additional biomarkers of prognostic and therapeutic potential. In silico genomic copy number analyses demonstrated that patient samples harboring a genomic deletion of PTEN have a greater number of genomic aberrations, in keeping with the model that loss of PTEN leads to heightened genomic instability. Mining of publically available gene expression datasets have been performed to further examine signalling pathway aberrations specific to each rearrangement. PTEN loss and ERG over-expression are being modeled in the histologically normal prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1 using shRNA knockdown or transgene directed ectopic over-expression, respectively. Biochemical, proliferation, migration and invasion assays will be performed to determine if knockdown of PTEN leads to the expected AKT activation and increased proliferation; whereas over-expression of ERG in RWPE-1 cells correlates with heightened motility and invasive potential.

The reactive stromal microenvironment of PCa facilitates tumor growth through cytokine and chemokine-mediated cell signaling. STAT1, a transcription factor, induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and modulates immune and inflammatory response through IFN-/ cytokine activation. IFN-/ may be secreted in response to PI3K/AKT activation, since this pathway is associated with JAK/STAT signaling. In addition, the PI3K/AKT pathway can become activated when the PTEN prognostic biomarker is deleted in PCa. The rationale for this project is that the immediate stromal microenvironment of PCa may become pro-tumorigenic as a result of induction of inflammatory cytokines caused by PTEN deletions and activation of PI3K/AKT. We performed FISH analysis of the PTEN gene on 172 cores on a PCa tissue microarray (TMA) derived from 43 patients with intermediate risk disease. Analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear STAT1 in both the tumor and stromal compartments was performed on each TMA core using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine whether the tumor PTEN deletion status was associated with STAT1 expression. In each core, tumor and stromal cell histologies were evaluated independently to estimate the percentage area that was stained positive by IHC. The staining was graded as percentage of positive cells with 0 (negative), 1 (less than 10%), 2 (11% to 50%), and 3 (more than 51%). We found that STAT1 expression in stroma was increased when the PTEN gene in the adjacent tumor was homozygously deleted (p = 0,04).

PTEN is one of the most commonly lost tumor suppressors in human cancer; in fact, up to 40% of men with prostate cancer are estimated to have lost a copy of the PTEN gene at the time of diagnosis. Slides stained with CymogenDx's PTEN del-TECT FOUR COLOR probe, developed for reliably detecting PTEN deletion, are scanned using 3DHISTECH's Panoramic 250 FLASH II digital slide scanner and the resulting whole slides are subsequently analyzed using 3DHISTECH's FISHQuant software. The ability to capture fluorescent signals from 9 independent channels and up to 29 different Z layers with perfect co-localization enables the creation of multiple labelled fluorescent slides. 3DHISTECH's Extended Focus feature creates a single in-focus image where all the in-focus parts of each captured layer is merged into one composite image. This enables the use of automated algorithms to evaluate different FISH probes in tissue and cytology whole slide samples. The FISHQuant software segments nuclei and spots automatically and scores the resulting data. For PTEN deletion, it measures the deletion clusters for the 3 colors involved. It also uses the control to check for numerical deviation of the 10th chromosome's signals. These two measurements are run automatically and displayed on a two-dimensional HistoPlot. This proof of concept study, using prostate core needle biopsies, demonstrates that the PTEN deletion FISH signals captured on a digital slide and overlaid in bright field and fluorescence modes can be subsequently analyzed using automated algorithms. The ability to identify tumor heterogeneity in a prostate core biopsy (and other sample preps) thus becomes possible. Extended focus and the patent pending PTEN del-TECT FOUR COLOR probe limits truncations artifact and makes a huge difference as sections get thinner due to other tests needing to be performed.

Here we characterize Pten loss induced cellular senescence (PICS) as a novel type of senescence. Additionally, we show that compounds which target PTEN and MDM-2 can be used alone or in combination to potentiate the senescence pathway in tumors of genetically engineered mouse (GEM) and human xenografts models. Methods', ' Cell growth inhibition, western blot analysis and senescence assay (SA) were performed on LnCAP, MDA-PCa2b and PC3 cancer cell lines.

Results', ' PICS, represents a distinct type of senescence response that can be targeted for cancer therapy.

Pharmacological inhibition of PTEN drives senescence in vitro and inhibits tumourigenesis in vivo in a human xenograft model. We also find that PICS is associated with enhanced mTOR-dependent p53 translation. In agreement with these mechanistic findings, N dramatically potentiate senescence and strongly inhibits tumorigenesis in Ptenpc-/- mice. Combination of V and N acts synergistically in inducing senescence in vitro and reducing cell growth. Conclusions', ' Taken together, our data identify a type of cellular senescence that can be triggered in non-proliferating cells in the absence of DNA damage . On the basis of this concept, we define a molecular framework for \"pro-senescence\" therapy against cancer.']",

        "Background":"['One of the common contributors to the pre-disposition of most human cancers is inappropriate activation of AKT due to loss of its negative regulator PTEN. Activated AKT regulates changes in metabolic processes such as acetyl-CoA production that impacts chromatin. AKT phosphorylates a wide variety of histone modulating enzymes including acetyltransferases and methyltransferases resulting in their hyperactivation or inhibition. Therefore, understanding the impact of AKT inhibition on global histone modification would be ideal to identify novel histone modifiers regulated by AKT. We performed unbiased and comprehensive profiling of histone modifications in prostate specific PTEN knockout mice treated with an AKT inhibitor (Perifosine, 10mg/kg body weight daily for 4 weeks) and observed that AKT inhibition significantly induces di and tri methylation of H3K4, concomitant with reduction acetylation of H3K9. Changes in other histone modifications such as H3K36 and H3K79 methylation and acetylation were not observed. Mechanistically, we observed that AKT inihibiton reduces the expression of H3K4 methylation related histone demethylases KDM5 family, especially KDM5B expression at transcriptional level. Similar observations were noted at translational level also. To further understand the transcriptional regulation of KDM5B by AKT we focused on miR-137 and miR-138 as these have been shown to transcriptionally regulate H3K4 demethylases. We observed that AKT activation negatively regulated miR-137 but not miR-138 levels, which further transcriptionally represses KDM5B expression. Overexpression of miR-137 significantly reduced KDM5B and increased H3K4 di and tri methylation levels but failed to change AKT phosphorylation. Genetic knockdown of AKT or inhibition of AKT phosphorylation increased miR137 and reduced both KDM5B levels. Overall, we observed that AKT transcriptionally regulates KDM5B mainly via repression of miR137. Our data identify a mechanism by which PI3K/AKT signaling modulates the prostate cancer epigenome through regulating H3K4 methylation and KDM5B expression. Additional studies that assess the impact of AKT inhibiton on genome occupancy of H3K4 methylation will help in the identification of targets and devise novel strategies to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of PI3K/AKT inhibitors that are currently in clinical development.']",

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer affects one in three men over the age of 60. Loss of expression or function of PTEN is the most commonly observed molecular defect in human prostate cancer. Thirty to 70% of clinical cases exhibit loss of this critical tumor suppressor. PTEN is an essential negative regulator of PI3K/Akt signaling. Together with the mTOR pathway, the PTEN/PI3K/Akt cascade forms a network for cellular responses to growth factors and nutrients. Studies in mice have demonstrated that small changes in PTEN dose can influence cancer development. Thus, understanding the regulation of PTEN expression and function is key to understanding tumor progression. We have previously reported that signaling through the Notch-1 receptor pathway results in increased transcriptional expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN. We further reported that Notch-1 signaling was lost in the tumor foci of clinical prostate cancer cases as compared to the surrounding benign tissue. Herein, we report that Notch-1 signaling alters the pool of active, unphosphorylated PTEN in the human metastatic prostate tumor cell line DU145. Retroviral transduction was used to generate DU145 cells that express constitutively active Notch-1 (DU/ICN1). In cells with constitutively active Notch-1 (DU/ICN1), the pool of unphosphorylated PTEN was increased roughly 2.5 fold compared to the vector only control. Constitutive Notch-1 signaling also resulted in decreased mTOR signaling as determined by a decrease in phosphorlyated 4E-BP1 and phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein. Decreased expression of Raptor and Rictor and decreased phosphorylation of mTOR were also observed in the presence of constitutively active Notch-1. To test if Notch-1 signaling influences tumor engraftment and growth in a syngeneic model, the tumorigenic C2 cell line, derived from TRAMP mice, was transduced with constitutively active Notch-1. C2/ICN1 and parental C2 cells were engrafted into C57/BL6 mice. All recipients of the parental C2 cell line developed tumors within 46 days, whereas none that received cells expressing constitutively active Notch-1 (C2/ICN1) had developed tumors. Only after 61 days did one of the four mice that received C2/ICN1 cells develop tumors. We next tested if loss of Notch-1 expression promotes characteristics associated with tumorigenicity by using lentiviral transduction to knock down endogenous Notch-1 expression in DU145 cells (DU/shN1). DU145 cells with loss of Notch-1 (DU/shN1) exhibited decreased expression of PTEN protein and a decreased ability to migrate in transwell experiments as compared with control cells expressing endogenous Notch-1. Collectively, these data indicate a role for Notch-1 receptor signaling in modulating the activity of PI3K/Akt and mTOR axis through regulation of the PTEN tumor suppressor, and suggest a mechanistic basis for Notch-1 tumor suppressive activity in prostate cells.']",

Deletions of PTEN e.g. in prostate cancers are associated with tumor aggression and poor outcome, and up to 70 percent of prostate cancer patients have lost one copy of the PTEN gene at the time of diagnosis. Recent pharmacologic and genetic studies have identified the  isoform of PI3K to be required for growth of PTEN-deficient tumors in vivo and highly potent compounds are currently being explored in the clinic. These clinical candidates, however, are either limited by poor bioavailability or moderate selectivity against the delta isoform, thus warranting more selective compounds with better exposure. We have undertaken a comprehensive knowledge-based discovery of selective inhibitors of PI3K with admissible pharmacokinetic and drug like properties. We have successfully identified a chemical series with potency ranging as low as 2.5 nM for PI3K with >100 - fold selectivity for PI3K. The  and  isoform selectivity was around 1000 and 500 fold respectively. Compounds did not decrease insulin sensitivity and T cell proliferation thus mitigating the PI3K and PI3K mediated side effects of nonselective inhibitors. In vitro biochemical potency translated into cell survival assay and pAKT target engagement in recombinant and wild type mammalian cell lines. In vivo tumor regression was observed in xenograft models of prostate cancer. The series did not show any observable hERG or CYP liabilities.

We show here that a selective inhibitor of PI3K beta inhibits the AKT/mTOR pathway in tumors with defective PTEN function, but is ineffective in those where the pathway is driven by receptor tyrosine kinases. However, inhibition of PI3K signaling by PI3K beta inhibitors is limited by relief of AKT/mTOR dependent feedback and reactivation of IGF1R and other receptors. This results in activation of PI3K alpha and a rebound of PI3K-AKT signaling. This rebound is suppressed and tumor cell inhibition is enhanced with combined inhibition of PI3K alpha and beta. Combined administration of isoform selective PI3K inhibitors may more effectively inhibit the pathway than pan-PI3K inhibitors because of the greater selectivity and decreased off-target toxicity of the former.In PTEN deficient models of prostate cancer, triple therapy with PI3K alpha and beta selective inhibitors combined with a potent androgen receptor inhibitor suppresses the reciprocal feedback activation of both pathways and results in marked (complete) eradication of tumors in vivo.']",

These drugs are also capable of producing antitumor effects in preclinical cancer models. In addition to mediating antitumor effects by impairing autophagy in certain cancer cells types, these agents have also been shown to effect antitumor responses independent of autophagy inhibition. Treatment strategies using CQ and its derivative alone or in combination with other anticancer drugs are being considered for clinical applications. However, the safety and long-term effects of CQ therapy for the treatment of cancers are unknown. In this study, we investigated the safety and efficacy of long-term CQ therapy in a PTEN-deficient model of prostate cancer. Twenty-eight-week-old tumor-bearing PTEN conditional knockout mice (PSA-CRE+/PTENf/f) were treated with CQ in the drinking water. Based on daily water consumption, the daily oral dose was adjusted to 100 mg/kg in distilled water. Timed sacrifices were scheduled 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 weeks after the initiation of treatments and subset of mice was used for survival analysis. Mice receiving CQ were healthy in appearance and normal in demeanor. Compared to controls, mice receiving CQ began to exhibit lower body weights over the course of treatment beginning at 5 weeks after the initiation of treatment. At the completion of the study, mice receiving CQ averaged 27.3 grams of bodyweight compared to 33.8 grams in the control group (P<0.001). However, chronic treatment with CQ for 32 weeks inhibited tumor burden by 18.4% (P = 0.0118). For the long-term survival studies, median survival for control and CQ treated mice was 83.4 and 82.0 days, respectively (P = 0.782).

Tumor burden at time of death decreased from 15.9% 5.9 of bodyweight in control mice to 2.5% 0.6 in CQ-treated mice (P<0.05). In summary, our studies show that long-term chronic administration of CQ was capable of inhibiting growth of PTEN-deficient tumors, however, CQ was poorly tolerated by mice and did not improve overall survival. Thus, caution should be exercised to carefully assess the safety and tolerability of this drug when using it long-term in human clinical trials.']",

Therefore, the prostate-specific PTEN-deletion driven prostate cancer mouse model resembles many features of human prostate cancer including disease progression to metastasis. Due to its high clinical relevance, this model is gaining wider utility for prostate cancer chemoprevention and therapeutic studies. Very recently, our collaborative team found that oral administration of methylseleninic acid (MSeA), a second-generation selenium compound, significantly inhibited PTEN-loss driven prostate tumorigenesis in vivo. In particular, the efficacy was associated with a super-activation of p53-p21 senescence pathway (PTEN-loss induced cellular senescence, PICS). To gain insights into additional molecular targets, we profiled the prostate proteome of PTEN-deletion mice. Whole prostates from PTEN-deletion mice (12-15 weeks of age) and their wild type littermate were obtained from the NCI Mouse Model Repository. Homogenate from 4 prostate pairs (Pten/ and wild type) was prepared and digested individually and the peptides were labeled with 8-plex iTRAQTM reagents. Labeled peptides were pooled and analyzed by 2D-LC-MS/MS (LTQ Orbitrap Velos, Thermo Scientific). Out of 949 proteins identified, we further analyzed 152, the expressions of which were significantly and concordantly changed in all four pairs of mice. Among them, we detected enrichment of proteins related to cellular senescence (chitinase-3 like protein3 [CH3L3], cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide [Camp]), p53 (S100-A8, sorbitol dehydrogenase [DHSO]) and molecular targets involved in AKT signaling pathway (lipocalin 2, CH3L3), in line with the well-described AKT driven p53-mediated senescence in Pten-deficient prostate cancer mouse model. We also found decreased protein expression of GRP78 (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein), endoplasmin, probasin and TGM4 (transglutaminase4), same as we reported in the TRAMP model. Some of these protein changes (over or under) were predicated by published changes of their mRNA levels in prostates (probasin, TGM4, etc) and/or protein levels in sera (probasin, endoplasmin, GRP78, etc). Moreover, the congruence on some proteins (DHSO, S100-A8, etc) between the mouse model and clinical specimens (e.g. by C. Sawyers) highlights the clinical relevance of the model.

Previous studies with non metastatic prostate cancer (mCaP) cells have reported low Rad51 levels in cells with loss of PTEN or under hypoxia, which then led to their sensitivity to PARPi. Given intra tumor hypoxia and loss of PTEN is common in mCaP, we test PAPRi, ABT888 and DNA damaging topoisomerase I inhibitor, CPT11, either alone or in combination in mCaP preclinical models. Methods', '  mCaP cell lines with functional PTEN (DU145) and loss of PTEN (PC3) were grew under normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (0.2% O2).

Results', '  Despite of its low levels of expression under hypoxia, up regulation of Rad51 was observed soon after treating hypoxic PC3 and Du145 cells with ABT888 or SN38, an active metabolite of CPT11. Such Rad51 up regulation led to less DNA damage and apoptosis under hypoxia compared to normoxia. Inhibiting RAD51 expression with siRNA overcame PC3 and Du145s resistance to SN38.

The PCa xenografts were derived from PCas in the prostate or direct extensions to adjacent organs (21) or from metastases to bone (4), lymph node (3), liver (6), thyroid (1), testis (1), adrenal gland (2), brain (3), and unusual sites (skin, chest wall, soft tissue) (4) or ascites (3), and pleural effusions (3). 81% of xenografts derived from prostatic adenocarcinomas were AR positive (27/33); 16 were small-cell, poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas or ductal adenocarcinomas and did not express AR. One sarcomatoid and 1 ductal adenocarcinoma expressed AR; 77% of evaluable tumors had a deletion in PTEN (31/40); 48% of AR-positive tumors expressed recurrent gene fusions (eg, ERG, ETV1, ETV5) (13/27). Together, these results in this cohort_AR and recurrent gene fusion expression and PTEN deletion_nicely correlate with findings in human PCa. We next assessed whether PCa xenografts maintained histopathologic and molecular fidelity with the human tumor of origin in selected cases (n=16). Histopathologic pattern and recurrent gene fusion expression were the same in the paired human and mouse tissue. The AR and PTEN status were the same in most paired human and mouse samples. In 4 cases, AR expression was lost or PTEN deleted in the PCa xenograft, suggesting that selection for more aggressive genotypes may occur during xenograft development and that PCa xenografts develop by selecting cells drivers of cancer progression. In conclusion, we have developed a protocol for xenograft development that has fidelity with human PCa. This approach has provided a repository of clinically annotated samples that can be linked prospectively to clinical progression/response to therapy and thus will help identify therapy responders.']",

PTEN is a well-characterized tumor suppressor gene that is lost or mutated in many human cancers including ~50% of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Reintroduction of functional PTEN for mCRPC treatment has proven difficult. Methods', ' PTEN mRNA was synthesized by in vitro transcription method and modified with ARCA capping and enzymatic polyadenylation, and then substituted with Pseudo-UTP, 5-Methyl-CTP. A robust self-assembly approach was employed to prepare PTEN mRNA nanoparticles (NPs) using cationic lipid-like compound G0-C14 and PLGA polymer coated with lipid-PEG shell. PTEN expression in tumors and PI3K-AKT pathway were confirmed by IHC and western blot, respectively. Apoptosis was checked by flow cytometry and Tunel assays. In vivo toxicity was studied by hematologic and histologic tests, and immune response. Results', ' We successfully restored PTEN mRNA to PTEN-null prostate cancer (PCa) cells via systemic delivery of mRNA NPs. These mRNA NPs are stable in serum, demonstrate minimal toxicity, and provide highly effective transfection in PCa cells (substantially higher HA-PTEN expression than plasmid PTEN transfection) and PCa xenograft tumors, leading to ~85% inhibition of tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We also confirm mRNA NP-mediated systemic restoration of PTEN function in PTEN-null PCa and delineate its tumor suppression through inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway and enhancement of apoptosis. Conclusions', ' The work provides proof of principle for the systemic reintroduction of mRNA-based tumor suppressor genes to tumors in vivo. Because PTEN loss is frequent in late-stage PCa, this approach may have feasibility in this patient population. Considering the strong potential of mRNA therapy and the lack of systemic studies of in vivo mRNA transfection of tumors, this study sheds light on the useful application of NP-mediated mRNA delivery for validating tumor suppressors (e.g., PTEN) as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment where loss of a tumor suppressor contributes to the underlying genetic mechanism of cancer.']",

The antitumor effects of AZD5363, a pan AKT inhibitor, and AZD1208, a highly potent Pim kinase inhibitor, were investigated as monotherapy or in combination on mice harboring castration-naïve prostate tumors and mice that developed castration-resistant disease. Mice were randomized treated for four weeks. Safety and tolerability was assessed by bodyweight changes. Antitumor activity was determined by differences in tumor burden, proliferation and apoptosis and histology. Molecular activity was assessed by examining the phosphorylation of common substrates by western blot analysis. Treatments were well-tolerated and no significant differences in bodyweight changes were observed. In castration-naïve prostate tumors, treatments with AZD5363, AZD1208 and AZD5363/AZD1208 resulted in 11.9%, 13.5% and 36.9% reductions of tumor burden compared to vehicle treated controls, respectively, P<0.001.

Traditional approaches for the development of novel androgen deprivation therapies have focused on inhibition of AR activity by blocking the production or binding of androgens to the AR. These novel treatment strategies have shown improvements, however, patients still develop castration-resistant disease. Continued AR activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) may be the result of ligand dependent or ligand independent mechanisms. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) have the ability to block specific genes inhibiting the associated proteins thus providing an alternate treatment strategy for CRPC. Here, we investigated the in vivo antitumor effects of a generation 2.5 ASO targeting the mouse AR in a PTEN-deficient mouse model of prostate cancer. Pharmacodynamic analysis demonstrated strong inhibition of target RNA by the AR-ASO in prostate tumor tissues. The AR-ASO also exhibited strong suppression of AR protein levels in prostate tumors as demonstrated by western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed reduced levels of AR expression and transcriptional activity in tumor tissue. Furthermore, AR was also inhibited in normal tissues of the accessory sex glands. The treatment efficacy of the AR-ASO was evaluated in pharmacological intervention trials in mice with castration-nave prostate cancer (CNPC) and CRPC. Treatments effects in CNPC were also compared to androgen deprivation by surgical castration. Compared to saline treated controls, tumor growth was significantly inhibited by the AR-ASO (34%) and was comparable to that of surgical castration (38%). In the CRPC model, significant suppression of tumor growth (10% vs control) was also observed in mice treated with the AR-ASO. Furthermore, strong inhibition of AR expression and activity was observed in AR-ASO-treated mice harboring either CNPC or CRPC, but not in mice treated with surgical castration. Gene expression profiling using the Fluidigm Biomark platform revealed that 40 AR-dependent target genes were significantly altered in CNPC after treatment with the AR-ASO; 34 of these genes were also significantly changed following castration. A decrease of ERK phosphorylation in was observed in AR-ASO-treated mice in both CNPC and CRPC intervention models and was associated with decreased protein levels of AR.

Chemopreventive and anticancer effects of Res may be exerted in part by modulating various components of the epigenetic machinery. We recently demonstrated that Res represses nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) co-repressor complex by inhibiting metastasis associated protein 1/ histone deacetylase 1 (MTA1/HDAC1) subunit, which plays an essential role in governing deacetylation of histone and non-histone proteins. Since Res-induced upregulation of tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is concomitant with MTA1-downregulation, we hypothesized that in the absence of Res MTA1 works in cooperation with PI3K/Akt survival pathways. We further hypothesized that Res-induced restoration of PTEN expression and function may occur by dual mechanism through MTA1/HDAC inhibition and regulation of miRNA network. Our data indicate that shRNA-mediated MTA1 knockdown in Du145 cells (wt PTEN) enhances acetylation of PTEN, and that HDAC inhibitor trichostatin (TSA) further potentiates PTEN acetylation. We also showed that Res treatment simultaneously decreases MTA1 and pAkt levels in LNCaP cells, the effect which is enhanced in combination with PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and BEZ235. To further understand Res-induced MTA1-mediated epigenetic alterations, we analyzed MTA1-associated and Res-induced microRNA (miRNA, miR) changes in LNCaP cells expressing and silenced for MTA1 (shMTA1). Interestingly, Res downregulated miRs (oncomiRs) included members of miR17-92 cluster (miRs-17, 20a, 20b) and miRs 106a and 106b which target PTEN. These findings were further confirmed by real time PCR analysis which showed that Res specifically down-regulated these miRNAs in PCa cells (LNCaP and Du145) but not in normal prostate cell line RWPE-1. Direct interaction of miR-17, miR-20a and miR-106b with PTEN 3UTR were analyzed in the presence and absence of Res using pmiRGLO luciferase reporter.

For proteomics, 4 pairs of whole prostates from Pten-KO mice (12-15 weeks of age, corresponding to high grade PIN) and their wild type littermate housed in same cages were obtained from the NCI Mouse Model Repository and analyzed by 8-plex iTRAQTM. For transcriptomic/microarray and metabolomic analyses, 3 additional matched pairs of prostate/tumor specimens at older age (22-20 weeks) were used.

Similar to the manual annotation approach, each network analysis of 203 genes and 22 proteins (≥ 2- fold changes) by a bioinformatics software, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed that inflammatory response, cellular movement, immune cell trafficking, immunological disease, and cancer were top 5 disease and biological functions in Pten-KO mice. Using references from PubMed, we manually assigned the unmapped prostate metabolites to functional categories, which included altered methionine-cysteine cycle fluxes and purine metabolites, increased nucleotide pools, cholesterol and polyamine synthesis and suppressed pools of sugar and choline derivatives, glycolysis intermediates, and purine bases. IPA network analysis of 25 metabolites (≥ 2- fold changes) revealed the biological functions related to molecular transport, amino acid metabolism, and small molecule biochemistry. In addition, we integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data sets to identify latent biological relationships and to gain a comprehensive understanding of Pten-deficient prostate carcinogenesis. The integrative analysis predicted activation of inflammatory response and several central signaling nodes, such as IRF7, NF-κB, and IL-6.

Here we explored a novel strategy of simultaneous inhibition of AR and activation of GR signaling for prostate cancer treatment using non-steroidal AR/GR modulator Compound A (CpdA) in combination with proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (BZ). We and others found that CpdA acts as anti-inflammatory anti-androgen. It inhibits basal and DHT-induced AR activity; does not induce GR dimerization and transactivation but induces GR transrepression via inhibition of several transcription factors, including NF-kB, AP-1, and others. We also previously reported that CpdA has high anti-PC potential (Yemelyanov et al., 2008). It is known that GR and AR are controlled by proteasomal degradation. Here we show that prolonged exposure of prostate carcinoma (PCa) cells PC3 (AR-/GR+), DU145 (AR-/GR+), LNCaP (AR+/GR-), and LNCaP-GR (AR+/GR+), to BZ caused AR degradation and GR accumulation. BZ enhanced CpdA ability to inhibit AR and to augment GR transrepression. We also found that CpdA+BZ cooperatively inhibited PCa cell growth and survival and induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) as was indicated by up-regulation of BIP/HSPA5, ATF2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and by induction of downstream pro-apoptotic ERS effector CHOP/GADD153. In contrast, glucocorticoid fluocinolone acetate and androgen DHT down-regulated cytoplasmic and nuclear CHOP, pointing to the ability of the androgens and glucocorticoids to counteract ERS in PC cells. Using ChIP we showed that BIP/HSPA5 and CHOP regulation was due to effects of CpdA and CpdA+BZ on GR loading on their promoters. Since CHOP/GADD153 was differentially activated by CpdA and BZ+CpdA via GR, we analyzed its role in anti-cancer effect of CpdA+BZ. The cooperative CpdA+BZ growth suppression and induction of apoptosis were significantly stronger in LNCaP-GR-CHOP compared to LNCaP-GR cells with low endogenous CHOP expression. Growth suppression and apoptosis induction by CpdA+BZ were drastically diminished in LNCaP-GR-shCHOP cells with depleted endogenous CHOP. Finally, we found that AR and GR are abundant in advanced PCa from patients treated by androgen ablation and/or chemotherapy', ' 56% of carcinomas from treated patients expressed both receptors, and the other 27% expressed either GR or AR.

Since PTEN is yet to be effectively targeted with drugs, its downstream target Akt may provide more viable therapeutic strategies. The essential role of Akt in PTEN-null tumor initiation has been demonstrated in a number of studies. However, the role of Akt in the maintenance of established PTEN-deficient tumors is not known. Moreover, whether PTEN-null tumors depend on a specific Akt isoform for survival signaling remains elusive.In this study, we have developed a tet-on inducible system for expressing Akt1/2/3 shRNAs to determine the role of Akt isoforms in PTEN-deficient cancer progression. Three-dimensional (3D) matrigel cultures are employed to better recapitulate tumors growing in vivo. Administration of doxycycline (dox) in Akt1 or Akt2 shRNA PTEN-null prostate tumor cells at the start of culture resulted in the inhibition of spheroid formation, suggesting an important role of both Akt1 and Akt2 in the initial growth of spheroids. Conversely, when spheroids were allowed to form for 7 days, followed by dox for further 10 days, no difference was observed between Akt1-depleted and control spheroids. In contrast, silencing of Akt2 resulted in complete disintegration of spheroids. Confocal microscopy studies show a significant induction of active caspase-3 and fragmented nuclei in Akt2-silenced cells. Moreover, whereas Akt1 is uniformly expressed, Akt2 is localized in the cytoplasm and/or on the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the differences of effect of Akt isoforms on cell survival in conventional 2D culture are considerably more modest. The exclusive requirement of Akt2 for survival is also observed in other PTEN-deficient solid tumors, including breast cancer and glioblastoma. Importantly, shRNA silencing of Akt2 but not Akt1 promotes regression of prostate cancer xenografts. Mechanistically, we show that Akt2 silencing up-regulates p21 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and downregulates the insulin-like growth factor receptor-1. We also show that p21 is an effector of Akt2 in mediating prostate tumor cell survival.These results indicate that Akt2, but not Akt1, plays a critical role in PTEN-deficient tumor maintenance, and provide a rationale for developing therapeutics targeting Akt2. Current efforts are aimed at identifying novel Akt isoform-specific substrates that contribute to cancer progression using a genome-wide proteomic screen.

        "Background":"['Autophagy (also referred to as macroautophagy) is a self-catabolic process that maintains intracellular homeostasis and prolongs cell survival by the autophagosomic-lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic contents during metabolic stress or nutrient starvation. Inactivation of PTEN tumor suppressor function is a common characteristic of human prostate cancer that leads to the upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and has emerged as promising candidate for targeted therapies. mTOR is one of the upstream regulators of autophagy, therefore, inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis putatively stimulates autophagy. However, the role of autophagy in cancer is complex, acting both as a tumor suppressor and promoter, and its role in prostate tumorigenesis remains to be defined. Here we demonstrate that prostate cancer is dependent on autophagy for its growth and progression through the use genetically modified mouse models of prostate cancer.We had previously reported a conditional knockout mouse model in which homozygous deletion of PTEN lead to the stage-specific development of invasive adenocarcinoma. Characterization of tumors from the mice showed that although autophagy was suppressed early in tumor development, tumors eventually restored autophagic function despite increased PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. To determine the effect of defective autophagy on prostate cancer progression, we generated prostate-specific conditional double knockout mice harboring both inactivated PTEN and ATG7, a key regulator for the formation of autophagosomes. Prostate-specific inactivation of ATG7 function alone did not result in changes to the development or function of the prostate gland. Prostate-specific inactivation of both PTEN and ATG7 led to the early development of prostate adenocarcinoma similar to homozygous PTEN-mutant mice.

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer (PCa) arises from progression of pre-invasive lesions such as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to adenocarcinoma and metastatic disease. Due to the very long latency of lesion progression, chemoprevention of prostate adenocarcinogenesis is recognized as a plausible and essential approach to win the war against PCa. Whereas the results from recent clinical trials (SWOG 9917 and SELECT) did not support the protective function for seleno-methionine (SeMet) supplement in healthy men with or without high grade PIN, we and others have shown that supra-nutritional supplement of methylseleninic acid (MSeA), which differs, both chemically and metabolically, from SeMet, suppressed tumor growth in human prostate cancer xenografts, and in the transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. However, the former models did not mimic primary prevention, and the TRAMP mice vastly differ from the etiology and adenocarcinogenesis nature of the human prostate cancers. Therefore, a mouse model that closely recapitulates the clinic pathological features of human prostate cancer will be essential and necessary to predict the preventive efficacy and mechanisms of MSeA in men. As the loss of tumor suppressor gene Pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) plays a causal role in human prostate cancers, the prostate epithelial-specific Pten-knockout mouse is such a preclinical model of choice. Here we utilized Probasin-Cre (Pb-Cre) transgenic mice expressing Cre to delete Pten in prostate epithelium to investigate whether administration of MSeA inhibited prostate tumorigenesis. We treated Pten-knockout and age-matched wild type male mice from 8 weeks of age with water or MSeA at a dose of 3 mg/kg body weight five times a week (Monday through Friday) for 27 weeks and sacrificed them for analyses. Our results show that MSeA significantly suppressed prostate tumorigenesis as evidenced by (1) suppression of tumor progression to high grade PIN or/and adenocarcinoma; (2) a 50% reduction in prostate tumor weight (P<0.01); (3) a significant reduction in cellular proliferation determined by ki67 immunostaining (P<0.01); and (4) attenuation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Mechanistically, we found that MSeA induced a super-activation of p53, p21 and cellular senescence. Because intact p53 signaling is preserved in most early prostate lesions, our findings provide compelling rationale to consider MSeA as a bioactive dietary supplement to activate p53-p21 mediated senescence as a barrier to prevent PIN from progressing to advanced prostate cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Mutations of multiple tumor suppressor genes, such as PTEN and p53, have been proposed to play important roles in the development of prostate cancer. Loss of one allele of PTEN occurs in 70-80% of human primary prostate tumors and homozygous inactivation of PTEN is associated with advanced disease. Similarly, p53 is found completely lost or mutated almost exclusively in advanced human prostate cancer. Thus, selective killing of prostate cancer cells harboring mutations of PTEN and p53 may prove to be a promising strategy for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. The Warburg effect of aerobic glycolysis has now been generally accepted as a key metabolic hallmark of cancer. In this study, we investigated the molecular target leading to the Warburg effect in the growth and aggressiveness of prostate cancer cells harboring inactivation of PTEN and p53 and delineated the underlying mechanism. We identified that expression of hexokinase II (HK2), an enzyme involved in the first step of glycolysis, is preferentially elevated in human prostate cancer cells bearing mutations of both PTEN and p53 (PC3). Functional studies demonstrated that HK2 expression is crucial for the Warburg effect in PC3 cells and knockdown of HK2 inhibits tumor growth in PC3 xenograft mouse model. These novel findings prompted us to test whether 2-de-oxyglucose (2-DG), an inhibitor of HK2, could potentially suppress prostate cancer growth by targeting the Warburg effect. We found that an induction of AMPK-dependent autophagy prevents cancer cells from apoptosis upon 2-DG treatment, thereby limiting therapeutic efficacy on prostate cancer in vivo. Consistent with cell survival function of autophagy, its inhibition by chloroquine (a small molecule inhibitor of autophagy) or individual knockdown of the essential genes involved in autophagy (Atg5, Atg7, Beclin1, and ULK1) induced massive cell death when combined with 2-DG. This cell death can be rescued by overexpression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 or downregulation of pro-apoptotic protein Bax in PC3. More importantly, we demonstrated that combination of chloroquine and 2-DG could specifically kill prostate cancer cells, leaving normal prostate epithelial cells untouched. This specificity is due to the preferential induction of HK2 through the activated Rictor-AKT-mTOR pathway in cancer cells. Finally, combination of chloroquine and 2-DG caused synthetic lethality in prostate cancer cells and effectively suppressed tumor growth in PC3 xenograft mouse model. Towards therapeutic translation, we have observed that expression of HK2 by staining primary human prostate tumor samples with HK2 antibodies correlated with the stages of prostate cancer. Given our findings, we therefore propose that targeting the Warburg effect and autophagy pathways may serve as an effective and selective treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer, in particular those with PTEN and p53 mutations.']",

While an overwhelming increase in ROS trigger cell/tissue damage and death, a slight pro-oxidant state on the other hand serves as a secondary messenger for cell survival and proliferation. Recent evidence also indicates crosstalk between cellular redox status and the PI3K/Akt axis. Consistent with this, in an attempt to understand the survival pathways induced by a slight increase in cellular pro-oxidant status, in particular superoxide anion, we investigated the effect of an altered redox status on the expression of the death inhibitory protein cFLIP. We show that an increase in superoxide resulted in an increase in cFLIP promoter activity as well as protein expression. Interestingly, overexpression of Akt1 or Akt 2 also resulted in cFLIP induction. Of note, the increase in cFLIP promoter activity measured by a luciferase expression system was significantly suppressed when PTEN was restored by over expression. On the other hand, co-expression of Akt1 and Akt2 abrogated PTEN mediated down regulation of cFLIP, further demonstrating the positive regulatory effect of Akt species on cFLIP transcription. More interestingly, the effect of Akt on cFLIP correlated with its ability to increase intracellular superoxide levels (measured by dihydroethidium (DHE) staining as well as Lucigenin-based chemiluminescence), which was in turn blocked upon overexpression of PTEN. Phosphorylation-inefficient mutant AKt construct (dominant negative Akt for S473 and T308 residues) lost 50% of its activity to upregulate cFLIP transcription, indicating that Akt phosphorylation/activation is required for ROS production and cFLIP transcriptional activation. Using functional mutants of PTEN (generously provided by Donald J. Tindall, Mayo Foundation, MN) we further show that the lipid phosphatase function of PTEN is required for its regulation of cFLIP expression. Furthermore, PTEN mediated down regulation of FLIP transcription was rescued by over expression of c-Jun and wild type CREB in a concentration dependent manner, which was corroborated by the observation that pCREB level was lower upon enforced PTEN expression. Finally, to provide a functional relevance of these findings, we demonstrate that PTEN restoration in PTEN-/- LnCaP cells resulted in enhanced sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, which could be rescued by over expression of isoforms of cFLIP, viz., cFLIPs and cFLIPL. Taken together, our preliminary data suggest that loss of PTEN leads to up-regulation of cFLIP transcription via redox dependent mechanisms, thus contributing to survival and chemoresistance in prostate cancer cells.']",

        "Background":"['Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is one of the most commonly lost tumor suppressors in human cancers. Frequent genetic inactivation of PTEN occurs in glioblastoma, endometrial cancer, and prostate cancer; and reduced expression is found in many other tumor types such as lung and breast cancer. PTEN is mostly found in the cytosol and it transiently associates with the inner surface of the plasma membrane and removes a phosphate group from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and by this, it regulates various cellular functions. However in the nucleus, PTEN mediates phosphatase independent functions and is believed to be important for its tumor suppressive roles. Functional studies further confirm the transcriptional regulatory role of the PTEN; however, the process by which PTEN acts as a potential modulator of chromatin structure and histone modification is unexplored. We observed that the enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase is upregulated in PTEN null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as compared to wild type counterparts, which suggested an inverse relation between EZH2 expression and PTEN expression. We further observed that phospho EZH2 levels (pEZH2ser21) were specifically upregulated in the PTEN null cells and coincided with the high pEZH2', 'EZH2 ratio in these settings, indicating that the majority of the upregulated EZH2 exists in the phosphorylated form. We also found that the pEZH2ser21 is mainly localized in the nucleus and only a small fraction exists in the cytoplasm, suggesting additional roles for pEZH2ser21 after partnering with cytoplasmic proteins. However, the non-phosphorylated form of the EZH2 is totally a nuclear protein under these conditions. Interestingly in PTEN null MEFs, transcriptional repression mark such as H3K27Me3 expression was downregulated with the simultaneous upregulation of H3K4Me3, an active transcription mark. Also, the increased expression of EZH2 primarily linked with the pause of active transcription, was associated with corresponding decrease in the H3K27Me3 repression mark which subsequently influenced the expression of various genes including senescence associated genes such as p21. Since, these aberrant histone methylation marks are hallmarks of various cancer pathologies, targeting EZH2 or its phosphorylation component could be a potential therapeutic strategy in cancers involving loss of PTEN. Taken together, these results demonstrate that in PTEN null processes, the pEZH2ser21 is capable of translocation, altering the histone marks and influencing genes associated with transcriptional repression and senescence. We also suggest that EZH2 could serve as important target for novel chemotherapeutics against cancers that are associated with loss of PTEN.']",

        "Background":"['In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that ROS accumulation correlates with increasing aggressiveness of prostate cancer cells, and increased expression of oncogenic molecules, such as CXCR4. CXCR4 is a G-Protein Coupled Receptor that is heavily implicated in the metastatic dissemination of prostate tumor cells to bone marrow. In cancer and other cell models, CXCR4 expression and activity increases in response to hypoxic environments and/or oxidative stress. Cells react by inducing expression of a HIF1 transcription factor, which enhances expression of targeted genes involved in adjusting to oxidative stress and cell survival. HIF1 has been shown to directly induce the expression of CXCR4 in prostate cancer cells. Therefore, generation of ROS in tumor tissues may critically influence CXCR4-mediated expression and functions, ultimately encouraging cancer progression. In this study, we elucidate a mechanism by which ROS induces CXCR4 expression and function in prostate cancer cells. We initially investigated the role of ROS on the phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT) and ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) in DU145 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines. Using H2O2 as our model of ROS, we found that H2O2 induced a gradual expression of p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 by western blot analysis, which was abrogated by the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). It has been shown that PTEN is a negative regulator of AKT and ERK1/2 signaling, and that ROS accumulation inactivates PTEN phosphatase function; hence, we determined whether the increase in p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 expression was due to loss of PTEN function. By performing a phosphatase assay, we found that H2O2 inhibited PTEN catalytic activity compared to untreated cells, while NAC abrogated these effects in both cell lines. The increase in ROS and loss of PTEN has been shown to correlate with CXCR4-mediated function; therefore, we determined the role of H2O2 on CXCR4 expression. We found that H2O2 induced CXCR4 expression in DU145 cells, but not in 22Rv1 cells. Furthermore, we investigated whether ROS-mediated induction of CXCR4 was HIF1 dependent. Interestingly, H2O2 induced expression of HIF1 in DU145 cells, which was abrogated by siRNA for HIF1. HIF1 expression decreased in 22Rv1 cells, which correlated with apoptosis, as confirmed by Annexin-V analysis. Finally, we observed that the H2O2-mediated increase in CXCR4 enhanced transendothelial invasion and migration in DU145 cells in a CXCR4 dependent manner. Our study suggests that ROS differentially regulates CXCR4 expression and function in prostate cancer cells, suggesting that ROS plays a differential role on heterogeneous tumor mass.']",

Primary cells revealed that loss of Pten/ Trp53 triggers secretion of the Il6 cytokine when these genes are deleted together, but not separately. Il6 then communicates a downstream program of Stat3-mediated Myc activation, which drives cell proliferation. Abrogation of Myc activity by Myc inhibition with the JQ1 bromodomain inhibitor, Myc-RNAi, and Myc-CRISPR/ Cas9 approaches inhibited proliferation. We validated these findings in vivo, where peak proliferation in Pten/ Trp53 mutant primary and metastatic PC did not correlate with activated Akt, but with Stat3/ Myc activation instead. Most notably, we found that Myc strongly activates the Akt phosphatase Phlpp2 in primary cells and RapidCaP metastasis, and showed genetically that Phlpp2 is essential for dictating proliferation and Myc-mediated suppression of Akt.Collectively, our data reveal competition between two proto-oncogenes', ' Myc and Akt, which ensnarls the Phlpp2 gene to facilitate Myc-driven metastasis.']",

PKC is up-regulated in most epithelial cancers, including prostate cancer. We recently showed that transgenic PKC overexpression in the mouse prostate under the control of probasin (PB) promoter leads to hyperplasia and prostatic intraepithelial neoplastic lesions but is insufficient to drive neoplastic changes. Strikingly, when we intercrossed the prostate-specific PKC transgenic mice with mice haploinsufficient for Pten, a common genetic alteration in human prostate cancer, the resulting compound mutant mice (PB-PKC;Pten+/- mice) developed fully invasive adenocarcinoma (unpublished observation). In the present study, to explore the mechanistic aspects of the observed cooperativity between PKC overexpression and Pten deficiency, we stably overexpressed PKC in mouse prostate epithelial lines that are either heterozygous (P8) or homozygous (CaP8) for Pten deletion. PKC overexpression led to significant enhancement in cell proliferation as well as enhanced the levels of phospho-Akt, phospho-Erk and phospho-mTOR; these effects are more pronounced in CaP8 cells. Moreover, migration, invasion, clonogenic and soft agar colony formation assays revealed a striking synergism between PKC overexpression and Pten loss. Furthermore, analysis of global gene expression by microarray revealed significant changes in gene related to EMT, adhesion, metabolism, and invasiveness following PKC overexpression, Pten loss or both. In particular, a chemokine CXCL13 was found to be majorly up-regulated in CaP8-PKC cells. Measurement of CXCL13 mRNA by qPCR or CXCL13 release to the conditioned medium (CM) by ELISA showed increased levels in PKC overexpressing or Pten depleted cells, and these effects were synergistically enhanced in CaP8-PKC cells. Remarkably, CM from CaP8-PKC cells led to significant induction in growth and motility of P8 cells. Importantly, CXCL13 RNAi depletion reduced the proliferative and migratory capacity of CaP8-PKC cells, thereby establishing the potential relevance of CXCL13 in the phenotypic effects of PKC overexpression and Pten loss. Concurrently, the growth and motile activity of P8 cells were enhanced in response to exogenously added CXCL13.

Treating CRPC with second generation androgen -ablation based therapies like enzalutamide and abiraterone exhibit only a short window of therapeutic benefit resulting in chemoresistance. Hence, there is an immediate need for identification of novel targets to eradicate CRPC effectively. We and others have reported targeting AKT activation could efficiently suppress the growth of CRPC cells; in fact a number of clinical trials have shown some promise that AKT could be an attractive target for CRPC. In fact, clinical studies from our lab have suggested that AKT activation predominantly occurs in Gleason stage specific manner suggesting identification of novel drugs to inhibit AKT activation is imperative. Our earlier finding suggests that Withaferin-A (WA), an herbal molecule effectively inhibits the growth of CRPC cells by downregulating AKT activation and its downstream pro-survival events. Present study investigated whether oral administration of WA may inhibit tumor development in Pten conditional knockout mice [(Pten-loxp/loxp', 'PB-Cre4+) (Pten-KO)] which will be a unique and appropriate preclinical model to study the AKT driven prostate tumor. Oral administration of WA for 45 weeks effectively prevented the tumor growth without any significant signs of toxicity to organs in Pten-KO mice. Vehicle and WA (5mg/kg body weight) were orally given up to 45 weeks. Gross pathological studies suggested a significant inhibition of growth and micro metastasis in WA-treated mice as compared to the vehicle treated mice.

All the organs were completely submitted for histological evaluation. None of the WA-treated mice organs showed any metastatic lesion on the other hand, we found discrete metastasis to lungs in the control tumors. Our ongoing immunohistochemistry analysis may corroborate our in vitro findings that down regulation of AKT and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers such as -catenin, snail, and vimentin in WA treated tumors as compared to the control mice.

Mounting evidence suggests that IL-6 contributes to prostate cancer progression. Activated IL-6 has been shown to be elevated in the sera from patients with metastatic prostate cancer and it appears that the prostate tissue itself is a source of IL-6 and its receptor. Experimental data suggests that the IL-6/IL-6R signaling axis is an autocrine and paracrine growth factor in androgen independent prostate cancer cell lines and can activate a variety of signal transduction cascades, some of which may activate androgen receptor activity. In the present study we examined the role of IL6-induced Stat3 activation in the development and progression of prostate cancer and its possible role as a target for the treatment of prostate cancer using the prostate-specific conditional targeting PTEN knockout mouse model. In PTEN-mutant mice, elevated levels of IL6/IL-6R correlated with increased cellular proliferation in non-castrate and castrate prostate cancer (CRPC). Similar to human prostate cancer, mice with CPRC showed elevated levels of IL-6 and IL6-R in both serum and prostate tissue. To establish a therapeutic role for IL6/IL6R inhibition, we conducted a series of pharmacodynamic studies using an anti-mouse IL-6R antibody (MR-16) in tumor bearing homozygous PTEN-mutant mice. Our data shows that STAT3 activation was inhibited in a dose dependent manner during acute IL6-R blockade. Inhibition of STAT3 activity after chronic IL-6R blockade was transient. However, at day 45 of treatment, tumor cell proliferation was inhibited and apoptosis was induced.

Although inhibition of this enzyme using a pharmacological inhibitor is postulated to enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging cytotoxic chemotherapy, this has not been profoundly studied in lung cancer. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) is a tumor-suppressor gene deactivating PI3K downstream of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) signaling. Approximately 2% to 9% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are considered to have PTEN loss, and a recurrent gross-mutation of the PTEN gene is identified in lung cancer with deficient DNA double-strand break repair. We hypothesize that there is a cellular threshold for error-free DNA-repair in lung cancer cells and that the absence of PTEN can sensitize these cells to a concurrent treatment of a DNA-damaging agent (cisplatin) and a PARP inhibitor (olaparib). To investigate the effect of olaparib and cisplatin on PTEN deficient lung tumors, two EGFR mutant (deletion in exon19) NSCLC cell lines, PC-9 (PTEN wild type) and NCI-H1650 (PTEN loss) were used.

Restoration of PTEN in the H1650 cells decreased sensitivity to olaparib and cisplatin (CI >1). Ablation of PTEN in PC-9 cells increased sensitivity to olaparib and cisplatin (CI <1). We also examined the effectiveness of the cisplatin (5 mg/kg/week) and olaparib (50 mg/kg/day) in a xenograft model using H1650 cells. The combination of cisplatin with olaparib was more effective than each agent individually. This effect was not observed in a xenograft model using PTEN transfected H1650 cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that PTEN-deficiency caused a reduction in radiation-induced nuclear RAD51 focus formation and activation of Chk1 S345. Thus, genetic inactivation of PTEN led to suppression of DNA repair. The combination of cisplatin with olaparib in PTEN deficient lung tumors should be further pursued.']",

All cancers were analyzed with dual-labeling probes including PTEN (10q23), TP53 (17p13.1), FOXP1 (3p14.1), CHD1 (5q21) and MAP3K7 (6q15) together with their respective centromere probes. In addition, ERG fusion status and tumor cell proliferation (Ki67 labeling index) of all cancers were determined by immunohistochemistry. Deletions were seen for PTEN in 17.9% of 6,122, TP53 in 14.7% of 7,604, FOXP1 in 9.2% of 6,059, CHD1 in 9.9% of 7,026, and for MAP3K7 in 18.7% of 3,528 interpretable cases. All deletions were strongly linked to the ERG status (p<0.0001 each).

The frequency of all these deletions increased significantly with tumor stage and grade. This was most prominently true for TP53, PTEN and MAP3K7 (p<0.0001 each).

There was a dose dependent relationship between the number of deletions and PSA recurrence. Tumors with no deletion had the best clinical outcome followed by cancers, with one, two, and three or more deletions (p<0.0001). Particular strong prognostic information was obtained by combining PTEN and p53 deletions. Patients with none of these alterations had 17% PSA recurrence while the respective figure was 40% on patients with both deletions.In summary, these data show, that chromosomal deletions are tightly linked with ERG status in prostate cancer and that most of these deletions have clinical relevance.

This has led to major efforts in developing anti-cancer drugs targeting the Akt pathway. Although the role of Akt in tumorigenesis has been studied extensively, little is known regarding isoform-specificity, and it is largely assumed that Akt isoforms play redundant roles in regulating cancer cell survival.In this study, we have developed a tet-on inducible system for expressing Akt1/2/3 shRNAs to determine the role of Akt isoforms in prostate cancer progression. Three-dimensional (3D) matrigel cultures are employed to better recapitulate tumors growing in vivo. Administration of doxycycline (dox) in Akt1 or Akt2 shRNA PTEN-deficient LNCaP cells at the start of culture resulted in the inhibition of spheroid formation, suggesting an important role of both Akt1 and Akt2 in the initial growth of spheroids. Conversely, when spheroids were allowed to form for 7 days, followed by dox for further 10 days, no difference was observed between Akt1-depleted and control spheroids. In contrast, silencing of Akt2 resulted in complete disintegration of spheroids. Confocal microscopy studies showed a significant induction of active caspase-3 and fragmented nuclei in Akt2-silenced cells. Moreover, whereas Akt1 is uniformly expressed, Akt2 is localized in the cytoplasm and/or on the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the differences of effect of Akt isoforms on cell survival in conventional 2D culture are considerably more modest. The exclusive requirement of Akt2 for survival is also observed in PC3 prostate cancer cells, which are also PTEN-deficient. Importantly, our preliminary data indicated that Akt2, but not Akt1 knockdown, led to tumor regression in the LnCaP xenograft model.These results indicate that Akt2, but not Akt1, plays a critical role in prostate cancer maintenance. Current efforts are aimed at identifying novel Akt isoform-specific substrates that contribute to prostate cancer progression using a genome-wide proteomic screen.

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer remains the second-leading cause of cancer death in men. The first line treatment for advanced prostate cancer is hormone deprivation therapy (ADT), which although it is initially effective, usually leads to progression to more aggressive and often lethal castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Nonetheless, CRPC remains dependent on androgen receptor (AR) signaling through various mechanisms. Therefore, drugs that target androgen synthesis or AR signaling, such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, have been employed as second line therapy. Despite the fact that both drugs improve the overall survival for CRPC patients, neither of them is curative, suggesting intrinsic or acquired resistance. Here we have focused on elucidating resistance mechanisms for abiraterone acetate, an inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis, using preclinical analyses of relevant genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs).Given the high frequency of co-alteration in PTEN and p53 in mCRPC, we generated conditional GEMMs based on deletion of either PTEN alone or PTEN plus p53 to obtain the NP and NPp53 GEMMs, respectively. Both NP and NPp53 mice develop CRPC, and cross-species gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggests that they have molecular programs that are well-conserved with human CRPC. In preclinical studies, we find that the NP mice are highly responsive to tumor inhibition by abiraterone, whereas the NPp53 mice do not respond. In fact, the NPp53 mice display a marked acceleration of tumor progression following abiraterone treatment. The disparate phenotypic responses of the NP and NPp53 mice to abiraterone are evident by analyses of their tumor histology, immunohistochemical staining, as well as the change in tumor volume by MRI imaging. We further validated the results in a genetically modified human prostate cancer cell line. In particular, a xenograft model based on 22RV1 cells that are depleted for both PTEN and p53 also displayed an acceleration of the tumor phenotype following abiraterone treatment. Notably, expression profiling of the abiraterone- or vehicle-treated responder NP tumors versus non-responder NPp53 tumors identified a unique set of cancer driver genes that are enriched for genes found in human neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). These findings were confirmed by immunohistochemistry, which demonstrated a significant increase in synaptophysin-expressing cells in CRPC in the NPp53 mice but not the NP mice.Our findings suggest that loss of p53 in the context of PTEN deletion promotes resistance to abiraterone while CRPC in the NPp53 mice partially resemble human NEPC. Given the high prevalence of co-alteration of PTEN and p53 in advanced human mCRPC, and observed occurrence of treatment induced NEPC-like phenotypes observed following treatment with AR targeting agents in patients, our finding suggest that abiraterone may not be suitable for patients with alterations in both PTEN and p53.']",

Microarray probesets mapping to exons of PTEN were benchmarked to identify a representative exon whose loss of expression was highly correlated to FISH analysis for PTEN deletion (PTEN-loss) performed on an independent dataset. ERG overexpression (ERG+) was determined similarly and the microarray probesets that best correlate with the FISH status (in independent dataset) were used to annotate the ERG status of the samples in this study. Receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC), and multivariable regression analysis were used to assess GC performance for predicting metastasis in subsets of patient tumors with genomic alterations.ResultsUsing the microarray method 42% of the tumors had ERG overexpression, 23% had PTEN-loss and 11% had both events. ERG+ and PTEN-loss were not on their own predictive of metastasis with AUCs of 0.52 (CI', '0.44-0.6) and 0.47(CI 0.39-0.56), respectively. In ERG+ tumors GC had an AUC of 0.82 (p=4e-7) and high GC score ERG+ patients had a hazard ratio (HR) of 100 (p=6e-7) for metastasis. Similarly, in PTEN-loss tumors GC had an AUC of 0.83 (p=7.9e-5) and high GC score PTEN-loss patients had an HR of 62 (p=1.8e-4) for metastasis.

To better understand the effects of increased dietary fat in prostate carcinogenesis, we developed a preclinical model using prostate-specific PTEN conditional knockout mice.

We previously showed that consumption of a high-fat diet (13.6% high fat plus N-nitroso-N-methylurea) for 75 weeks augmented prostate cancer progression in PTEN-mutant mice resulting increased metastases and decreased survival. To determine the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor promotion we randomized PTEN-mutant mice with non-castrate and castrate refractory prostate cancer to a high fat diet for 50 weeks.

Inhibition of autophagy can promote senescence resulting in decreased tumor growth. Genetic alterations of PTEN and p53 are frequently present in advanced human prostate cancer and are associated with poor prognosis. In mouse models, the inactivation of PTEN leads to the development of prostate tumors that progress slowly, in part due to the induction of PTEN-(loss)-induced cellular senescence. Concomitant inactivation of both PTEN and P53 in prostate leads to the development of an aggressive cancer phenotype that can overcome PTEN-(loss)-induced cellular senescence and is characterized with accelerated growth, metastatic development and decreased survival. Published findings show that in some cancer models, the effects of autophagy inhibition are dependent on p53 status. In this study we assessed the effects of pharmacological inhibition of autophagy with chloroquine (CQ) on the growth and progression of mouse prostate tumors driven by the concomitant inactivation of PTEN and p53. CQ is a lysosomotropic agent that has widely used to impede autophagy and inhibit the growth of human tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.

        "Background":"['Androgen ablation therapy is the standard treatment for advanced prostate cancer. While tumors initially respond to androgen deprivation, they almost always recur with an androgen-independent phenotype termed castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Castration-resistant tumors are incurable with current therapy regimens and account for most prostate cancer mortality. Better understanding of their biology is therefore critical for devising novel treatment options. Steroid Receptor Coactivator 3 (SRC-3) is a nuclear receptor coactivator that promotes growth of endocrine tissues. It enhances proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines and is highly expressed in advanced human prostate tumors. Despite this, the role of SRC-3 in CRPC is not well studied. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in most human prostate cancers. Mice harboring PTEN deletion in prostatic epithelial cells develop cancer that arises from progenitors in the luminal epithelial and basal compartments. Tumors histologically mimic advanced human disease and are castration-resistant. We hypothesized that, in prostate tumors caused by PTEN deletion, SRC-3 is a critical mediator for accelerating the development of CRPC. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice in which floxed PTEN and SRC-3 genes were concomitantly deleted in prostate epithelial cells via a Cre recombinase driven by the Probasin promoter. We first compared tumor mass, histology and biomarkers in these PTENf/f/SRC-3f/f/ARR2PBiCre (pten3cko) mice vs. PTENf/f/ARR2PBiCre (ptencko) mice. We found that while tumor growth in pten3cko mice was slightly inhibited at 9 wks of age, tumor histology and cellular composition were not markedly different. We then castrated mice of both genotypes at 9-wks-old and harvested tumors at 12wks. Interestingly, castrated ptencko mice had significantly worsened tumor aggressivenessas indicated by increased proliferation index, reduced differentiation (increased p63; decreased K5 and K8) and increased reactive stroma (double staining of SMA and vimentin)versus their non-castrated counterparts. Amazingly, in addition to significantly reducing tumor size, SRC-3 ablation reversed all changes comprising the aggressive phenotype seen in the post-castration tumors. Further investigation showed SRC-3 deletion decreased mTOR signaling. Together, these data show that castration induces a worse tumor phenotype in the setting of PTEN deletion and that SRC-3 promotes this process by inducing epithelial cell proliferation and enhancing the growth-promoting effect of these cells on the stroma. Therefore, SRC-3 may serve as a potential target for controlling CRPC development.']",

Metastasis is a major driver of mortality and morbidity in prostate cancer, the most common cancer type in men and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the western world. To recapitulate the metastatic process in genetically engineered mice, we have developed the RapidCaP system, which uses prostate-directed viral infection to trigger focal loss of Pten and Trp53. Using luminescence and fluorescence, the RapidCaP system allows us to track disease progression in real-time and isolate metastases in distant tissues. This system provides a powerful platform for the identification and validation of candidate driver genes and for the efficient testing of novel therapeutics. Using this system, we have recently identified Myc as a critical, spontaneously activated driver in Pten-negative metastatic prostate cancer. Preliminary trials indicate that the Myc-suppressing Brd4 inhibitor JQ1 is ineffective towards primary disease, but induces metastatic regression. This specificity correlates with a switch from AKT-driven primary disease to MYC-driven metastatic disease. Our current efforts seek to determine how, when and why targeting of Myc using JQ1 and the PI 3-Kinase pathway using NVP-BKM120 can be best used to treat nave and castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.

        "Background":"['Critical loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) beside increased insulin signaling often results in mTOR activation which is associated with progression of lethal prostate cancer (PCa). Recently mTOR was shown to control de novo pyrimidine synthesis via S6K which directly phosphorylates Ser1859 on CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamoylase, dihydroorotase), the enzyme that catalyzes the first three steps of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. We assessed the CAD expression and phosprylation at Ser1859 in different in-vitro and in-vivo models of PCa and also tested the potential efficacy of fisetin, an agent which we previously established as a dual PI3K/AKT and mTOR inhibitor. We observed upregulation of CAD both at transcriptional and translational levels in PCa cell lines when compared with the non-tumorigenic prostate cells. However, a highly significant upregulation of CAD phosphorylation at Ser1859 was evident in PTEN deficient cells when compared with wild type PTEN cells. To confirm, we assessed the CAD phosphorylation at Ser1859 in PTEN knockout mice samples and observed significant increase in the CAD phosphorylation at Ser1859 but not in total CAD levels, suggesting high demands of de novo pyrimidine synthesis in PTEN deficient tumors. In another model of spontaneous PCa (TRAMP) an inverse association between CAD phosphorylation at Ser1859 and PTEN was observed. Based on the facts that PTEN deficient cells have high mTOR activity that is prerequisite for CAD phosphorylation we tested the efficacy of fisetin to inhibit CAD phosphorylation at Ser1859 in different PCa models. Fisetin significantly suppressed the CAD phosphorylation in tumorigenic PCa cells in-vitro. In-vivo efficay of fisetin for inhibition of CAD phosphorylation was also established in the xenograft study. However, decrease in abundance of CAD mRNA and protein in xenograft samples suggested fisetin additionally suppressed other mechanism(s) important for CAD expression. Next we determined the effect of fisetin to inhibit the growth factors (insulin/IGF-1/EGF) stimulated CAD oligomerization in PCa cells important for CAD activity. Fisetin significantly suppressed the growth factors induced CAD oligomerization as observed by electron microscopy and density gradient based western blotting. However, we did not find significant S-phase blockage by fisetin under similar conditions. Based on these data we suggest that PTEN deficient PCa epithelial tumors possess heightened de novo pyrimidine requirements, satisfied by growth factor stimulated and mTOR regulated CAD phosphorylation and oligomerization. Fisetin inhibits both CAD phosphorylation at Ser1859 and oligomerization and thereby limits pyrimidine sufficiency in PTEN deficient PCa cells. Our results add additional mechanistic insight in the fisetin mediated inhibition of PCa and suggest the use of fisetin in PTEN deficient PCa incidents.']",

        "Background":"['Background', '  Pten loss-induced cellular senescence (PICS) is characterized by the absence of hyper-replication, as well as lack of DNA damage response. Therapeutic enhancement of cellular senescence in tumors triggers an irreversible cell growth arrest and activation of a tumor immune response that can be used for cancer therapy. Currently, there are only a limited number of targeted therapies that act by increasing senescence in cancers but these therapies are not selective for cancer cells.  Methods', '  We developed a combined chemical and shRNA screening platform to identify compounds that selectively enhance senescence in Pten deficient cells without affecting normal cells. By using this approach, we identified several Casein Kinase II (CK2) inhibitors as highly effective and selective pro-senescence compounds in Pten null cells and tumors.  Results', '  We have identified CK2 inhibitors through our chemogenomic platform and furthur validated using shRNA kinase library. These compounds have enhanced the cellular senescence in Pten deficient cells. Mechanistically, we find that CK2 mRNA and protein levels are strongly up regulated in Pten null cells and PML is downregulated. Interestingly, CK2 transcription depends on the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, STAT3 that is highly phosphorylated in Pten null tumors. Treatment of Pten null prostate tumors with CK2 inhibitors has lead to the stabilization of PML thereby restoring its tumor suppressor activity; which then prompts more cells to enter senescence leading to tumor regression.   Conclusions', '  Using our novel platform technologies we have discovered better pro-senescence compounds and systematically validating them in vitro and in vivo.

Here, we present our findings from a preclinical study of increased dietary fat consumption and its effects on prostate tumor growth and progression using genetically engineered mouse models of prostate cancer. We determined the effects of a high fat diet on tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis in vivo using a well-established mouse model of prostate cancer. Twenty-week-old mice, with conditional biallelic deletion of PTEN, harboring castration-nave or castration-resistant prostate tumors were randomized and assigned to a standard laboratory diet (4% fat) or a high-fat diet (HFD, 13.6% fat) for 8 weeks. In both tumor models, mice fed a HFD had increased expression levels of proteins associated with proliferation and decreased levels of apoptosis markers. To determine the long term effects of a HFD, we used a mouse model of advanced prostate cancer. Mice with concomitant inactivation of PTEN and p53 develop tumors that progress quickly and are characterized with increased metastatic development and decreased survival compared to PTEN knockout mice. PTEN/p53 double knockout mice were randomized and assigned to control or HFD experimental groups after weaning. Our findings revealed that mice fed a HFD resulted in obesity that led to decreased progression-free survival and overall survival rates compared to mice fed a standard diet.

We also observed increased expression of ETS2 at both mRNA and protein levels in prostate tissues from the prostate-specific MTA1 transgenic mice.

Interestingly, the prostate-specific Pten heterozygous mice, when fed with diet supplemented with pterostilbene, a natural pharmacological inhibitor of MTA1, showed a decrease in ETS2 mRNA and protein levels, perhaps due to decreased recruitment of MTA1 onto the ETS2 promoter.

The Jak/Stat pathway (Jak - Janus kinase, Stat - signal transducer and activators of transcription) is an important signaling cascade in prostate cancer. Stat3 seems to play a fundamental role in the regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and hormone-resistance in prostate cancer. Although there has been evidence for an oncogenic function of Stat3, observations from several laboratories suggest the opposite. Under certain conditions activation of Stat3 leads to decreased growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro (LNCaP) and can exert an inhibitory effect on prostate cancer xenografts. To elucidate the role of IL-6/Stat3 signaling in prostate cancer (PCa), we have established Pten-deficient (Ptenpc-/) PCa mouse models with additional deletion of IL-6 or Stat3. Ablation of IL-6 in Ptenpc-/ mice led to increased tumor formation and signs of massive chronic inflammation. In addition, Ptenpc-/- IL-6/- mice showed decreased expression of p53-dependent cellular senescence markers when compared to PCa in Ptenpc-/- mice. The concomitant Pten and Stat3 inactivation (Pten/Stat3pc-/) enhanced cell proliferation and accelerated the prostate cancer progression as well as production of inflammatory cytokines.

Indeed, high doses of estrogen, in combination with androgens, can initiate prostate cancer. This effect is attributed to the activity of the estrogen receptor  (ER), but a paucity of suitable models means that the precise role of ER in prostate cancer is still poorly understood.In this study we observed increased ER expression in three different models of prostate cancer, PTEN null mice, Hi-Myc mice, and high grade human tumor specimens. Within the PTEN null prostate, there was a consistent pattern of ER expression', ' low in benign glands, moderate in tumors within the dorsal, lateral and ventral lobes, and high in tumors within the anterior prostate. This pattern significantly correlated with the levels of the proliferative marker Ki67. There was also a significant correlation between ER and Ki67 within individual malignant glands in the anterior prostate. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ER sustained the in vitro proliferation of cells derived from a PTEN null tumor in 2D and 3D assays. There was a significant decrease in proliferation in cells treated with TPSF, a non-competitive ER antagonist, or with ER-specific shRNA. Loss of ER caused a significant decrease in the levels of MYC and other ER target genes. It also reduced the activity of both the PI3K and MAPK pathways as measured by decreased levels of phosphorylated erk1/2, S6 kinase and other downstream factors. This effect was reversed in rescue experiments with expression constructs for both full length ER, capable of genomic and non-genomic actions, and membrane-only ER, only able to trigger rapid non-genomic signalling.Collectively, these results demonstrate that ER levels increase in prostate cancer, which promotes proliferation through classical genomic and rapid non-genomic signalling.']",

Deletions in the gene Chromodomain Helicase DNA Binding Protein 1 (CHD1) are among the most frequent genomic alterations in prostate cancer. CHD1 is a ATPase-dependent helicase mediating a variety of biological processes by modifying chromatin structure. In hormone sensitive prostate cancer, loss of CHD1 has been associated with increased genomic instability and aggressiveness. Here we monitor CHD1 status during the progression from hormone sensitive (HSPC) to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). To molecularly stratify this patient subgroup we correlate CHD1 status with markers of prostate cancer including AR, ERG, PTEN and Ki67. Finally, we analyze the impact of alterations in CHD1 on outcome and response to therapy of CRPC patients. We retrospectively identified 52 patients of whom HSPC and CRPC tissue was available for immunohistochemical analysis of CHD1, ERG, PTEN, AR and Ki67 as well as for CHD1 fluorescence in situ hybridization. Relationship with outcome was analyzed using univariate Cox regression and log-rank analyses. By using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a cohort of 52 men who developed CRPC, we show that the frequency of loss of CHD1 does not change during disease progression (7.7% in HSPC vs 9.6% in CRPC). Homozygously deleted tumors demonstrate a tendency towards poorer prognosis but this observation lacks statistical power in our cohort. Interestingly, in patients that show CHD1 protein expression in their hormone nave sample, a decrease of expression in the matched CRPC sample correlates with poorer overall survival (OS) (p = 0.03). Although preclinical data suggest a role for CHD1 in androgen receptor (AR) activity, CHD1 expression did not correlate with AR protein level. Additionally, Ki67 expression did not show correlation with CHD1 levels of expression. Further molecular stratification confirms a known mutual exclusive relationship with the expression of the ERG transcription factor (p = 0.048). Clinically, although decreased CHD1 protein expression during disease progression correlated with worse outcome (overall survival (p = 0.03) and survival from diagnosis of CRPC (p = 0.02)), no significant impact on survival after docetaxel or abiraterone treatment was measured.Here we monitor CHD1 deletion during prostate cancer progression. Our results show that this genomic marker defines a distinct molecular subgroup of prostate cancer. In addition, loss of CHD1 protein expression during disease progression is associated with poorer clinical outcome.']",

CQ can also block autophagy, an essential cellular process that is implicated with resistance to chemotherapy. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the anticancer effects of CQ and hydroxychloroquine when used in combination with other anticancer agents suggesting that blocking autophagy inhibits therapeutic resistance. However, recent data shows that CQ can have antitumor effects independent of autophagy. Furthermore, given the specific roles of autophagy during tumorigenesis, the therapeutic effects of CQ observed in xenograft studies may differ than those in an autochthonous tumor model. The aim of our study was to investigate the antitumor effects of CQ in an autochthonous tumor model and to determine if CQ could reverse therapeutic resistance through the induction of autophagy. To test this hypothesis we tested the therapeutic administration of CQ in a genetically engineered mouse model of prostate cancer driven by the conditional inactivation of PTEN. We also characterized the combinatorial effects of CQ in combination with additional molecular targeting that included mTOR (everolimus), AKT (AZD5363), MEK (Selumetinib; AZD6244/ARRY142886), 5-reductase (dutasteride) inhibitors. Oral administration of CQ demonstrated antitumor activity and moderately, but significantly, inhibited growth PTEN-deficient prostate tumors in a drug intervention model. However, combination therapy with CQ did not enhance therapeutic efficacy over inhibitor monotherapy alone. Mice with PTEN-mutant castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are resistant to treatment with everolimus. Therefore, we tested whether blocking autophagy could restore sensitivity to everolimus in CRPC. Mice with mutant PTEN and ATG7, an autophagy regulatory gene, CRPC demonstrated increased sensitivity and activity to everolimus suggesting that defective autophagy restored resistance to everolimus. On, the contrary, the treatment the combination of CQ and everolimus failed to produce any treatment effects in PTEN-deficient/ATG7-wildtype CRPC. Our findings suggest that combinatorial strategies with CQ lack therapeutic efficacy in autochthonous tumors and might be ineffective in the clinical setting.']",

Herein, we investigated whether δ-T is able to inhibit the development of prostate adenocarcinoma in prostate-specific Pten-/- (Ptenp-/-) mice, in which the activation of AKT resulted from loss of Pten is the driver. By feeding Ptenp-/- mice with the AIN93M or 0.2% δ-T supplemented diet starting at the age of 6 or 12 weeks, we found that, at the age of 40 weeks, δ-T treatment reduced the number of invasive prostate adenocarcinoma by 53.3% (p<0.005) and 42.7% (p<0.001), respectively. By immunohistochemical analysis, the activation of AKT via phosphorylation of AKT(T308) was found reduced in the prostate of the mice on δ-T diet. Consistently, proliferation was reduced and apoptosis was increased in prostate of the mice on δ-T diet. We also determined oxidative stress by immunohistochemical staining of 8-OH-dG and nitro-tyrosine, and found that these markers were not altered during prostate tumorigenesis, nor they were affected by δ-T. A 0.2% α-tocopherol diet was also used to feed Ptenp-/- mice, but did not inhibit the development of prostate adenocarcinoma, consistent with previous data demonstrating that α-tocopherol did not inhibit the activation of AKT.

Oncogenic mutations and loss of tumor suppressor genes that cause uncontrolled cell-cycle progression are required events in tumor development. Nevertheless, many of these genetic alterations retain an intrinsic tumor-suppressive potential that gives rise to oncogene-induced senescence and tumor suppressor loss-induced senescence. Interestingly, many evidences support the idea that a strong interplay occurs between senescence, cancer cells, and tumor infiltrating immune populations, thus opening at the possibility to tune such interplay for cancer treatment. Indeed, tumor infiltrating T helper 1 cells can drive senescence in cancers in a cytokine-induced manner, by secreting IFN and TNF in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, we recently described a model where Pten loss induced senescence is hindered in prostate tumor by non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. Our study support a model where tumor-infiltrating CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid cells paracrinally triggers tumor senescence evasion in the prostate of Pten null mice, eventually promoting tumor progression. These findings well be discussed. Interestingly, we will present new evidences from our lab indicating that M1 macrophages are polarized to the M2 phenotype in both Pten pc-/- and that treatments that interfere with the M1-M2 polarization and switch the skewing to the M1 polarization profile can induce senescence in Pten; Trp53pc-/- invasive prostate cancer tumours thereby arresting tumour progression.

MTA1/HDAC unit is a part of the multi-protein nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex. In our previous studies we found that MTA1 expression is significantly increased in prostate-specific Pten-null model, and that potent natural analog of resveratrol, pterostilbene (PTER), exerts its anti-tumorigenic effects by blocking MTA1-associated inactivation (deacetylation) of tumor suppressors.

Although the association between dietary factors and the occurrence of prostate cancer has been studied extensively, there is yet to be a published study on the relationship between diet and disease progression among prostate cancer patients. Circulating levels of most adipokines are positively correlated with obesity and exert a variety of biologic effects on prostate cancer cells modulating a variety of cellular processes. This would suggest that the presence of obesity may promote the progression of established prostate cancer rather than being a risk factor for the development of prostate cancer; however, a direct link has yet to be established. Recognizing adipose tissue as a metabolically active endocrine organ and identifying tumor promoting adipokines would support such an association.To better understand the effects of increased dietary fat in prostate cancer, we used the prostate-specific PTEN conditional knockout mouse model to show that consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) promoted prostate-specific cancer progression and decreased survival. Molecular analysis identified elevated levels of leptin as a likely molecule involved in driving tumor progression. In this study we provide data from in vitro experiments show that leptin promoted invasiveness, motility and adhesion of PC3, human prostate cancer cells.

Several therapies are currently approved for use against CRPC, consisting mostly of androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibitors and toxic anti-microtubule chemotherapeutics that do not score long-term durable responses. Recent deep-sequencing analysis studies have elucidated the complex and heterogeneous landscape of CRPC, highlighting the necessity to develop effective targeted therapies against specific CRPC subtypes or therapies effective against numerous subtypes of CRPC. PTEN and p53 are two of the most frequently altered genes in CRPC, and are associated with therapy resistance and a poor clinical prognosis. The objective of this study was to identify and subsequently validate therapeutic targets against models of advanced PCa, specifically in the absence of PTEN and p53. Using non-biased high throughput screening technology, we identified HSP90 inhibitors to be potent and efficacious against a model of PTEN/p53 null PCa. HSP90 is a critical regulator of prostate cancer cell signaling homeostasis, and recently developed second generation compounds targeting HSP90 are effective against genotypically heterogeneous panels of cancer cell lines and have favorable safety parameters in the clinic. Screening results and subsequent validation efforts in vitro identified ganetespib as the most potent HSP90 inhibitor, with efficacy that translated into established human PCa cells lines. Ganetespib also displayed strongly inhibitory activity against PTEN/p53 null progenitor cells, a plastic subpopulation of PCa believed to be partly responsible for therapy resistance. In vivo, ganetespib completely inhibited progression of PIN to invasive adenocarcinoma in the Pten/Tp53 null PCa mouse model, leading to a significant reduction in tumor weight. Expanding from the mouse model to clinically predictive PDX-derived LuCaP models of human PCa, we found that ganetespib displayed a range of activity against a genotypically diverse array of 11 LuCaP organoids ex vivo. Furthermore, the PTEN null/p53 altered LuCaP 136 displayed a robust response to ganetespib in vivo, with ganetespib causing a significant reduction in tumor growth. Mechanistic interrogation in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo revealed ganetespib induced effects to be multifactorial and model specific, with unifying trends being inactivation of PI3K signaling and modulation of cell cycle regulatory proteins. In all, these data indicate that inhibition of HSP90 is a novel therapeutic to treat advanced PCa via multifactorial perturbation of growth regulatory pathways.']",

In this study we performed immunohistochemistry staining, immunofluorescence imaging, immunoprecipitation, shRNA and Western blotting analysis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), mouse models, and cultured human prostate cancer cells. As a result, we discovered that SKP2 modulates JARID1B and H3K4me3 levels in vitro in PTEN null prostate cancer cells and in vivo in Pten/Trp53 mouse models. We demonstrated that levels of SKP2, JARID1B and H3K4me3 are strikingly elevated in vitro and in vivo when both PTEN and P53 are inactivated. Importantly, SKP2 inactivation resulted in a reduction of cell growth, cell migration and malignant transformation of Pten/Trp53 double null MEFs, and further restrained prostate tumorigenesis of Pten/Trp53 mutant mice. Mechanistically, JARID1B is ubiquitinated by E3 ligase TRAF6 through the K63-linkage in prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, SKP2 contributes to JARID1B ubiquitination machinery as a non-E3 ligase regulator by decreasing TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination of JARID1B. SKP2 deficiency resulted in an increase of JARID1B ubiquitination and in turn a reduction of H3K4me3, and induced senescence through JARID1B accumulation in nucleoli of PCa cells and prostate tumors of mice. Furthermore, we showed that the aberrant levels of SKP2, JARID1B, and H3K4me3 are associated with malignant features of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in mice.

This transition is emerging as an important mechanism of treatment resistance. This cell plasticity is characterized by loss of androgen receptor (AR) and prostate specific antigen (PSA), and significant over-expression and gene amplification of MYCN (encoding N-Myc). While N-Myc is a bona fide driver oncogene in several rare tumor types, the molecular mechanisms that underlie N-Myc driven NEPC have yet to be characterized.Integrating a novel genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model of prostate specific N-Myc overexpression, human prostate cancer cell line modeling, and human prostate cancer transcriptome data, we found that N-Myc over-expression leads to the development of poorly differentiated, invasive prostate cancer that is molecularly similar to human NEPC tumors. To determine if N-Myc plays a causal role in driving the NEPC phenotype, we generated GEM lines that carry a CAG-driven lox-stop-lox human MYCN gene integrated into the ROSA26 (LSL-MYCN) locus and either a Tmprss2 driven tamoxifen-activated Cre recombinase (T2-Cre) or probasin (Pb)-Cre. Since PTEN deletion is a frequent alteration in CRPC and PI3K/AKT signaling can enhance N-Myc protein stability we also engineered the mice with a floxed Pten locus. N-Myc over-expression in the context of Ptenf/+ at 3 months post-induction leads to focal mouse high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mHGPIN). T2-Cre; Ptenf/f; LSL-MYCN+/+ mice develop highly proliferative, diffuse mHGPIN which consists of proliferations of cells with nuclear atypia that expand the glands, imparting irregular borders and inducing a mild stromal response, mitotic figures, and incipient necrosis.

At 6 months, Pb-Cre; Ptenf/f; LSL-MYCN+/+ mice develop poorly differentiated, highly proliferative, invasive prostate cancer.Based on the RNAseq data from the N-Myc GEM line, GEM-derived mouse prostate cancer organoid cultures and isogenic cell lines, we found that N-Myc regulates a specific NEPC-associated molecular program that includes a repression of AR signaling, enhanced AKT signaling and repression of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 target genes. We further showed that N-Myc interacts with AR and this interaction depends on Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2). Finally, N-Myc expressing cell lines and organoids displayed an enhanced sensitivity to inhibitors targeting the AKT pathway, EZH2 and Aurora-A.Altogether, our data shows that N-Myc drives the neuroendocrine phenotype in prostate cancer and provides rationale for the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating this aggressive subtype of prostate cancer.']",

We found that MMP7 expression was significantly decreased in RC prostates compared to RC+ prostates, suggesting that lack of MMP7 expression is likely responsible for the observed phenotype. Furthermore, we found that IL17 treatment induced MMP7 mRNA and protein expression in exvivo cultured RC+ prostate tissues but not in RC prostate tissues, suggesting that MMP7 is a downstream target gene of IL17 signaling.

We present here for the first time that dietary plumbagin (PL) inhibits tumor development in intact as well as castrated Pten-KO mice. PL was mixed in an antioxidant free basal powdered diet and was given at two dose levels (200 and 500 ppm). Mice (4 wks old) were divided into three groups (Control (n=40), PL (200 ppm) (n=20), and PL (500 ppm) (n=40). Mice were sacrificed at 15 and 30 wks of age. To determine the prostate tumor volume, we carried out micro-PET/CT analysis of control and PL treated groups mice at 30 wks using a tumor selective radiopharmaceutical agent 124I-NM404. PL treatment (200 and 500 ppm) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease (p<0.01) in prostate tumor volume. PL treatment also resulted in a significant (P<0.001) decrease in weights of prostate tumors and urogenital apparatus at 15 and 30 wks. Histopathological analyses revealed inhibition of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to invasive adenocarcinoma at 15 and 30 wks. PL treated mice also showed a significant (P<0.01) inhibition of small invasive adenocarcinoma with cystic change at 30 wks. To determine the effects of PL in castrated resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), we castrated 26 Pten-KO mice at 10 wks and divided into 2 groups. PL treatment was started one wk after castration and continued until 50 wks. At 50 wks, castrated control Pten-KO mice illustrated atrophy of prostate tumors. PL treatment (500 ppm) further resulted in a significant decrease of prostate tumors weight of castrated Pten-KO mice. Histopathological analysis of PL treated mice prostate tumors showed significant decrease of both invasive adenocarcinoma and cystic change. Biochemical analyses of Pten-KO mice prostate tumors elicited a constitutive activation of AKT, protein kinase C epsilon (PKC), signal transducer and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3) and increased COX2 expression compared to wild type mice. PL treatment resulted in decreased expression of PKC, Stat3 and COX2 compared to control mice. We also observed that PL targets tumor associated macrophages (TAM) in prostate tumors. Prostate tumors of PL treated mice showed an increased infiltration of M1 macrophages and inhibition of M2 macrophages, as analyzed by immunohistochemical staining of F4/80, iNOS and L-arginase. PL treatment also inhibited the expression of vimentin and slug, the markers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate tumors. In summary, the results indicate that dietary PL inhibits growth of both primary and CRPC, which was accompanied inhibition of EMT and modulation of tumor microenvironment. We conclude that PL may be worthy of evaluation for the prevention and treatment of human PCa (Support', ' CA138761).']",

Analysis by HPLC-PDA and by direct infusion analysis of these fractions by FTICR-MS revealed the J-I consisted of mostly phenolics including the three anthocyanins in its mono- and di-glycoside forms. P-I consisted mostly of punicalin and, the punicalagins A and B, while P-II and J-II consisted mostly of ellagitannins and free ellagic acid.

The availability of these models would facilitate studies to elucidate the molecular events underlying disease progression, and would be invaluable for evaluating new treatment efficacy. Within extant mouse models, metastasis is rare and typically occurs at an advanced age. Using a bacterial artificial chromosome-based transgenic approach, we generated mice in which Hoxb13 regulatory elements drive expression of human MYC (Hoxb13MYC+) or Cre recombinase (Hoxb13Cre+). Hoxb13Cre+ mice were bred to mice carrying floxed Pten (Ptenfl) alleles to generate focal loss of Pten in the prostate epithelium. We then generated mice carrying both the Hoxb13MYC+ and Hoxb13Cre+ transgenes that also harbored two Ptenfl alleles. Phenotypic analyses of Hoxb13MYC+|Hoxb13Cre+| Ptenfl/fl males revealed pervasive low-grade mouse-PIN (mPIN) in all prostate lobes emerging at two weeks of age that became pervasive that progressed to high-grade mPINby four weeks. The lesions bore hallmarks of human PIN including increased nuclear and nucleolar size and dispersed chromatin. Immunostaining revealed MYC and androgen receptor expression and focal Pten loss within the epithelial compartment. mPIN incidence high-gradewas higher in ventral and anterior lobes. By twelve weeks, lesions progressed to cribriform mPIN/intraductal carcinoma was widespread and scattered intraductal carcinoma lesions were observed. At sixteen weeks, in all animals, large frank invasive adenocarcinoma lesions involving multiple prostate lobes were was present as well as, and histological analyses confirmed the presence of invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Interestingly, by 16 weeks, metastasis to pelvic and peritoneal lymph nodes occurred with 100% penetrance. In survival analyses, all Hoxb13MYC+|Hoxb13Cre+| Ptenfl/fl mice (N=12) reached criteria for euthanasia within 28 weeks. Liver and lung metastases were observed with high penetrance (>80%). In one case, metastatic spread to a thoracic vertebra was observed, which may represent the first hematogenous metastasis to bone in a mouse prostate cancer model. Copy number analyses using array-based comparative genomic hybridization revealed clonal gene gains and losses in primary prostate cancers and matched metastatic lesions, indicative of genomic instability. The incidence of aggressive cancer and the reproducible chronology of events will enable this model to serve as a robust platform to test strategies to interfere with disease initiation and progression.

We sequenced the genomes of 55 primary prostate tumors and matched normal tissues to catalogue somatic alterations and to study how they accumulate during oncogenesis and progression. By implementing an algorithm to identify genomic alterations that arise together, we found abundant sets of DNA rearrangements and deletions that may occur simultaneously in a single cell. This phenomenon, which we term chromoplexy,\" frequently accounts for the dysregulation of prostate cancer genes including PTEN, NKX3-1, TP53 and CDKN1B. The somatic fusion of TMPRSS2 and ERG, which occurs in approximately half of prostate cancers, predominantly arises with additional genomic rearrangements in the context of chromoplexy. We further demonstrate that TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive tumors display a unique profile of chromoplexy, with complex chains of rearrangements that may fuse DNA from four or more distinct chromosomes.In prostate cancer and other neoplasms, chromoplexy induces considerable genomic derangement in a series of relatively few events. In several instances, multiple cancer genes from non-contiguous regions of the genome appear to be disrupted simultaneously by this process, suggesting a model of punctuated progression during cancer evolution.

Reciprocal feedback regulation between the PI3K and androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathways helps maintain survival. We hypothesized that combined PI3K and AR pathway inhibition would improve the therapeutic outcome. Using an in vivo model of prostate cancer, we assessed the rational therapeutic combination of the mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, and the anti-androgen, chlormadinone acetate (CA), in PTEN deficient tumors. Treatment efficacy was examined in conditional PTEN-mutant mice that developed CRPC after surgical castration. Drug efficacy was evaluated by comparing differences in tumor burden, inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Treatment-specific responses were measured by downstream PI3K signal molecules, nuclear translocation of AR and activation of compensatory signaling pathways. Mice treated with everolimus or CA alone did not show a significant reduction in tumor burden compared to controls, however, the combination of everolimus and CA significantly inhibited tumor burden. Combination therapy also significantly inhibited cellular proliferation and increased apoptosis. PI3K pathway activation was effectively suppressed by everolimus as measured the levels of phosphorylated S6. No significant differences were noted in the nuclear translocation of the AR between control and treatment groups. Mice treated with the combination therapy demonstrated suppression of MAPK pathway activation. Interestingly, all treatments resulted in an increase of STAT3 activation. In summary, our findings show that AR re-challenge can sensitize CRPC to PI3K inhibition.

The system provides a powerful platform for identification and validation of candidate driver genes and for efficient testing of novel therapeutics. Using this approach, we have recently identified Myc as a critical, spontaneously activated driver in Pten-negative metastatic prostate cancer. In agreement, our previous trials indicated that the Myc-suppressing Brd4 inhibitor JQ1 is ineffective towards primary disease, but causes metastatic regression. Mechanistically, this specificity correlates with the switch from Akt-driven primary to Myc-driven metastatic disease.Intriguingly, however, advanced metastases in RapidCaP do not express the androgen receptor, in spite of being of epithelial origin as shown by the Nkx3.1 prostate marker. As a consequence, metastatic disease often shows little to no response to castration therapy and invariably results in lethal disease.

First, we used quantitative proteomic technologies to identify 785 glycoproteins from sera and prostate tissue of wild-type and prostate-specific PTEN-null mice. Second, following bioinformatic prioritization, we quantified 48 human orthologue candidate biomarkers in sera of patients with PCa or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

PTK6 is activated at the plasma membrane in PTEN-deficient mouse prostate tumors where the concentration of PIP3 is high due to PTEN loss of function. Membrane-associated PTK6 induces cell transformation, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and tumor cell metastasis. In human prostate cancer, active PTK6 associates with the plasma membrane and its increased expression correlates with metastasis and poor survival. Our studies aimed to characterize how the mislocalization and activation of PTK6 in prostate cancer is regulated.Results', ' Based on our observation that loss of PTEN induces accumulation of PTK6 at the membrane, we hypothesized that PTK6 binds to the plasma membrane secondary messenger phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). Amino acid sequence alignment predicts H52, Y53, and K54 of PTK6 as a potential PIP3 binding site, which resembles the lipid-binding HYK domain of tyrosine kinases BTK and Abl. Using NMR saturation transfer difference (STD) experiment, we observed that the SH2 domain of PTK6 contains a binding site for inositol trisphosphate (IP3) a soluble PIP3 mimic. As predicted, statistical analysis identified Y53 of the PTK6 HYK motif within the SH2 domain as a residue with substantial chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) induced by independent titrations with PIP3 analogs IP3, IP4, and 1,2-dihexanoyl PIP3 in 15N HSQC, as compared to controls. Using autophosphorylated and unphosphorylated PTK6, NMR STD experiments show that only active (pY342) PTK6 binds to IP3.

We have previously shown that CD8+ effector function is transiently increased following castration of prostate-specific Pten-/- mice. To determine inhibitory mechanisms responsible for the transient increase in effector function, we evaluated the role of myeloid cells in this model. We observed a heavy Gr-1+ cell infiltrate in the primary tumors which was markedly increased early after castration. Phenotypic profiling of tumor-infiltrating Gr-1+ cells from intact and castrated mice showed uniform CD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G+ marker expression and neutrophil morphology. To determine the functional importance of these tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), we administered anti-Ly6G antibody to intact Pten-/- mice. We found that depletion of TANs slightly increased tumor burden prior to castration. In addition, the number of regulatory T cells was elevated in the tumor after neutrophil depletion, and the proportion of functional CD8+ T cells was unchanged. In contrast, concomitant castration and neutrophil depletion did not change tumor weight, early (2.5 wk) or late (5 wk) after castration. Although the total number of CD8+ T cells in the tumor was increased by neutrophil depletion early after castration, the proportion of functional CD8+ T cells was unchanged. A striking increase in regulatory T cell (Treg) numbers was also observed. In contrast, the number of CD8+ T cells and the percentage of functional cells were increased late after castration and neutrophil depletion. Furthermore, depletion of neutrophils decreased intratumoral Tregs at 5 weeks post-castration. These data suggest that TANs modulate the tumor microenvironment, rendering it increasingly immunosuppressive late after castration. We have found that castration increases systemic Tregs in Pten-/- mice. To determine whether Tregs regulate neutrophil function in prostate tumors, we administered -CD25 antibody along with castration. Neutrophil numbers in castration-resistant prostate tumors increased, and expression of TNF, IL4R, iNOS, Arg, IL-6 and IL-12 by the neutrophils was also augmented. Concomitantly, an increase in the proportion of functional CD8+ T cells was observed. Interestingly, depletion of neutrophils abrogated the augmentation of CD8+ CTL activation following Treg depletion, suggesting that cross-talk between neutrophils and Tregs regulates CD8 effector function. Thus, TANs in Pten-/- prostate tumors have anti-tumor potential and can modulate both CD8+ effector T cells and Tregs within the tumor. Our long-term goal is to understand how TANs control effector and inhibitory arms of the immune system in order to improve outcomes following immunotherapy.']",

However, reports on the specific role of the immune system are contradictive since both suppression and acceleration of disease progression have been described. Overexpression of MYC and loss of PTEN are frequent genetic lesions in prostate cancer. It has been shown that these lesions induce chemokine expression, attraction of immune cells and subsequent angiogenesis and disease progression in cancer models.In this study we address the role of the adaptive immune system in prostate cancer progression in two independent spontaneous prostate cancer mouse models; the FVB/HiMYC mouse model in which prostate cancer formation is driven by transgenic expression of human MYC under control of the ARR2/probasin promoter, and the PB-Cre;PTENF/F mouse model in which prostate cancer formation is initiated by loss of PTEN expression. Both mouse models develop Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PIN) from the age of 4 weeks on. FVB/HiMYC mice develop invasive carcinoma from the age of 24 weeks and PB-Cre;PTENF/F mice from the age of 12 weeks on. To address the functional significance of lymphocytes in prostate cancer development, FVB/HiMYC and PB-Cre;PTENF/F were crossed to lymphocyte deficient RAG-1/ mice. Preliminary data suggest that both mouse models crossed to RAG-1/ have a longer latency of invasive carcinoma development and less extensive lesions than RAG-1+/ mice, suggesting an important role of the adaptive immune system in prostate cancer initiation and/or progression.Marked inflammation and increased nuclear BrdU incorporation was found in concert with prostate cancer development using immunohistochemistry. Flow cytometry confirmed an increase in CD45 positive cells in the prostate, which was not observed in blood. Studies to identify the lymphocyte population with a key role in prostate cancer development and to dissect the exact mechanism of growth promotion are currently ongoing. In addition, we will verify whether the identified immune cells and soluble mediators in the in vivo models are also found in human prostate cancer samples.In conclusion', ' Our study provides insight into the role of the adaptive immune system in prostate cancer development.

Growth factors mediate such signaling pathways that include the PI3K/Akt/PTEN/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK as well as other essential pathways. However various mitigating factors such a genetic variation, molecular diversity, diverging and converging of signaling pathways make it improbable that treatment with any single agent will result in any long-term enhanced tumor. To overcome such problems we investigated the toxicity and antitumor effects of combined targeted therapy with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the mulitkinase inhibitor sorafenib in a prostate-specific PTEN conditional knockout mouse model of human prostate cancer. Non-castrated and castrated (castrate-resistant prostate cancer model, CRPC) PSACre;PTENloxP/loxP mutant mice, harboring prostate tumors, were treated with everolimus and sorafenib alone or in combination for 4 weeks beginning at 16 weeks of age. All mice appeared healthy and there were no significant differences in body weights, appearance or histological findings between treatment and control groups at the end of the experiment. Our analysis shows that combination therapy has a significant additive inhibitory effect on tumor growth in non-castrate prostate cancer model (8.8 mm2, 7.7 mm2, 7.1 mm2 and 5.2 mm2 in control, everolimus, sorafenib and combination treatment groups, respectively, p=0.005). Ki67 expression was decreased and positive TUNEL apoptotic bodies was increased in combination treatment groups compared to everolimus and sorafenib monotherapy in both non-castrated and CRPC treatment groups. We also show that combination therapy, but not monotherapy, cooperated to inhibit phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B).

        "Background":"[\"Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a key cytokine in inflammation, which has been shown to play critical roles in development of prostate cancer, skin cancer, colon cancer, and breast cancer. We have previously demonstrated that IL-17 promotes prostate carcinogenesis, accompanied with increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) in the mouse prostate. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether MMP7 mediates IL-17's action and the underlying mechanisms. Mmp7 knockout (Mmp7/) mice were crossbred with phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) conditional knockout mice (Ptenpc-/, prostate-specific through probasin promoter-driven Cre recombinase). The prostate tumor phenotypes were analyzed among Mmp7+/+;Ptenpc-/, Mmp7+/;Ptenpc-/, and Mmp7/;Ptenpc-/ mice. MMP7-overexpression or MMP7 knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA) was generated in human prostate cancer LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines to explore the molecular mechanisms of MMP7's actions. We found that Mmp7/;Ptenpc-/ mice displayed prostates that were smaller than Mmp7+/+;Ptenpc-/ or Mmp7+/;Ptenpc-/ mice. Mmp7/;Ptenpc-/ mice developed a reduced number of invasive prostate adenocarcinomas with lower rate of cellular proliferation and higher rate of apoptosis than Mmp7+/+;Ptenpc-/ or Mmp7+/;Ptenpc-/ mice. In addition, the invasiveness of prostate tumor cells isolated from Mmp7/;Ptenpc-/ mice was significantly reduced compared to those isolated from Mmp7+/+;Ptenpc-/ mice in Matrigel invasion assays. Expression of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, such as -catenin, vimentin, Snail, and Slug, was dramatically reduced in Mmp7/;Ptenpc-/ mice compared to Mmp7+/+;Ptenpc-/ or Mmp7+/;Ptenpc-/ mice. In contrast, expression of the epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and claudin was increased in Mmp7/;Ptenpc-/ mice compared to Mmp7+/+;Ptenpc-/ or Mmp7+/;Ptenpc-/ mice. MMP7 cleaved E-cadherin and disrupted E-cadherin/-catenin complex to increase cytoplasmic and nuclear -catenin levels in the prostate cancer cells, thus up-regulating EMT transcription factors. In addition, IL-17 receptor C (Il-17rc) and Pten double knockout (Il-17rc/;Ptenpc-/) mice echoed the reduction of EMT in Mmp7/;Ptenpc-/ mice, compared to Il-17rc+/+;Ptenpc-/ mice. Further, IL-17 treatment induced MMP7 expression in LNCaP and C4-2B cells, leading to increased expression of EMT markers. In contrast, MMP7 knockdown inhibited IL-17-induced expression of EMT markers.

Stat3 has also been shown to induce the metastatic behavior of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Activation of Stat3 occurs by the binding of various cytokines to its receptors leading to the activation of the JAK/Stat3 signaling pathway. Of these cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been implicated in regulating growth of various malignant tumors and activated IL-6 has been shown to be elevated in the sera from patients with metastatic prostate cancer. In the present study we examined the IL6-induced Stat3 transcriptional activation in the development and progression of prostate cancer and its possible role as a target for the treatment of prostate cancer using the prostate-specific conditional targeting PTEN knockout mouse model. Homozygous PTEN-mutants develop prostate cancer in a stage-specific manner and have the ability to grow and develop castration-resistant prostate cancer after total androgen ablation by castration. ELISA assays revealed increased expression of soluble IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) in tissue lysates from prostate tumors in non-castrated and castrated mice (77.0  6.17 vs 23.75  5.17 ng/g of tissue, p<0.001, respectively) at 32 wks of age. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed correlated expression of with Stat3 transcriptional activation, proliferation and androgen receptor in tumors from castrated mice. To determine the role of IL-6R induced transcriptional activation of Stat3, non-castrated and castrated tumor bearing mice were treated with an anti-mouse IL-6R antibody (MR-16). Mice treated with MR-16 showed downregulation of phosphorylated Stat3, however, treatment failed to inhibit tumor development and cellular proliferation. However, it was discovered that therapeutic doses of MR16 treatment resulted in increased phosphorylation of Erk1/2. Our data suggests that inhibition of IL-6R-induced Stat3 activation is insufficient to suppress tumor growth; however, further studies need to be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of horizontal combination strategies targeting Stat3 and MAP kinase signaling cascades.']",

Current treatment for metastatic disease is initially hormone treatment and chemotherapy. While this produces a response in the vast majority of patients, it is not curative. Novel therapeutic agents could provide a further treatment strategy and it is therefore important to understand the molecular pathways which contribute to this disease. The RUNX family of genes have been implicated as both oncogenes and tumor suppressors, with their role being context dependent. It has been reported that RUNX2 may have a tumor suppressor role in early stage prostate cancer but that this may switch to an oncogenic role in later stage disease. Methods', ' This project examines the expression of both RUNX1 and RUNX2 in a tissue microarray (TMA) of human prostate cancers. In parallel to the human studies both RUNX1 and RUNX2 were investigated in murine models of prostate cancer. Results', ' Analysis of the TMA showed that increasing levels of RUNX2 were associated with increasing Gleason grade, shorter time to relapse and poorer survival; the opposite effect was seen in RUNX1, where low levels of protein expression correlated with shorter survival. In concordance with the human results, reducing levels of RUNX2 in mouse models was associated with delayed tumor initiation, and smaller, less cystic tumors at endpoint. The opposite effect was seen with Runx1 where low levels resulted in more aggressive and invasive disease. Finally, when loss of both genes was combined in a model with loss of Pten and stimulation of WNT, survival was significantly reduced compared to controls.

        "Background":"['The development and progression of prostate cancer involves deregulation of several signaling pathways including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The mTOR kinase forms an important component of PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN are observed at high frequency during the development of prostate cancer and often accompanied by activation of AKT and mTOR pathways. We initiated studies to identify polyphenols from dietary sources that could interact with the mTOR receptor and in silico studies showed that fisetin physically interacts with mTOR. Fisetin is a tetrahydroxyflavone, found in strawberry, apple, persimmon, kiwi, onion and cucumber where it serves as a coloring agent. Blind docking of fisetin to the mTOR target was performed with Autodock4 using the NMR structure 2NPU from the Protein Data Bank. Results placed fisetin in two clustered sites located between and on either side of the 4 helices. The binding energies were in the -7 to -8 Kcal/mol range for the binding constant. The binding on one site included hydrogen bonding to a glutamate by two hydroxyl groups. The second site was mostly hydrophobic, with the ring of fisetin stacking on rings from the peptide. We used a unique family of human prostate epithelial cell lines, derived from RWPE-1 by exposure to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) to study the effect of fisetin on mTOR signaling. The MNU cell lines, in order of increasing malignancy and phenotype are; WPE1-NA22, WPE1-NB14, WPE1-NB11, and WPE1-NB26 and mimic multiple steps in the process of prostate carcinogenesis. We observed that transformed cells exhibited increase in the activity and phosphorylation of mTOR, PI3K, Akt, Erk and p-S6 that was associated with gradual loss of PTEN and decrease in the levels of p-AMPK, a negative regulator of mTOR. We treated cells with fisetin (0-80 M) for 24-72 hours and observed that transformed cells exhibited greater sensitivity to fisetin induced cell death. As cells transform from a normal phenotype to a malignant phenotype they acquire higher mTOR expression and become more susceptible to fisetin induced cell death. In presence of fisetin, cells expressing higher mTOR levels formed less number of colonies that were also smaller in size. Fisetin treatment resulted in inhibition of PI3K, p-Akt and p-Erk. Treatment of cells with fisetin, downregulated components of mTOR including Raptor, Rictor, PRAS40 and GL leading to loss of mTOR complexes 1/2. Fisetin also activated the mTOR repressor TSC2 through inhibition of Akt, activation of AMPK and PTEN. It is noteworthy that mTOR and Erk/MAPK signaling pathways function cooperatively to promote development of advanced prostate cancer. Our observations suggest that fisetin, through its ability to inhibit mTOR signaling, could be developed as a novel non-toxic agent for slowing the progression of the disease and as an adjuvant for the management of advanced prostate cancer.']",

No available prostate cancer cell lines harbor endogenous SPOP mutations, making model systems a critical need. Here, we describe a new mouse model with conditional transgenic expression of SPOP-F133V in the mouse prostate.Experimental Design', ' We generated a conditional mouse with the SPOP-F133V transgene knocked in to the Rosa26 locus (R26F133V); these mice were crossed with Pb-Cre4 mice to express SPOP-F133V specifically in the prostate.  Since PTEN deletion is known to drive prostate cancer progression, we crossed Pb-Cre4; R26F133V mice with Ptenf/f mice to study the impact of SPOP mutation in the background of conditional heterozygous (f/+) and homozygous (f/f) loss of Pten. Organoid lines were derived from transgenic mouse prostates and infected with inducible Cre-ERT2 to serve as in vitro platforms, 2D as well as 3D, for additional studies. RNA-Seq was performed on independently induced samples.Results', ' Pb-Cre4;R26F133V mouse prostates showed a minimal histological phenotype, with rare cytological changes of atypical nuclei (p<0.005) in one year old mice. In combination with Ptenf/+, SPOP-F133V expression resulted HG-PIN in 80% (n = 6) of mice, age 6 month, compared to only 20% (n = 8) in control mice. In addition, the HG-PIN in R26F133V;Ptenf/+ mice showed a distinct phenotype with strong nuclear atypia absent in controls. In the background of Ptenf/f, SPOP-F133V leads to poorly differentiated, invasive cancer (n = 8 out of 9) compared to control mice (Ptenf/f), which displayed only HG-PIN (n = 6). Organoids with expression of SPOP-F133V showed increased proliferation and increased ki67 staining. To define signaling pathways controlled by mutant SPOP in the prostate, we performed RNA-seq on mouse organoids expressing SPOP-F133V and controls. We interrogated the gene space nominated by the mouse F133V mutation to the human prostate cancer TCGA transcriptome. Unsupervised clustering demonstrated a highly significant enrichment of ETS negative human prostate cancer (p<2.21016), supporting the relevance of our transgenic models to human prostate cancer.Summary', ' Mutation in SPOP causes an early onset of HG-PIN in the prostate of Ptenf/+ mice, and progression to poorly differentiated invasive cancer in Ptenf/f mice. HG-PIN shows a very distinct histological phenotype with strong nuclear atypia. Gene expression in murine prostate organoids expressing SPOP-F133V strongly correlates with human tumors, providing relevance for this novel mouse model in defining the biology and therapeutic vulnerability of this subclass of prostate cancer.']",

Identifying mechanisms that are related to the rapid progression of the disease could result in development of appropriate intervention strategies. We analyzed protein and mRNA expression of Grb10 (also known as insulin receptor-binding protein) in various PCa cell lines and found a significant decrease when compared to normal prostate epithelial cells. We also analyzed the expression pattern of Grb10 in a human PCa tissue array and found significant loss of Grb10 mRNA in more than 90% of the samples. Based on Gleason Score, the loss of Grb10 mRNA correlated with the stage and grade of the disease. These initial observations led us to hypothesize that Grb10 may act as a tumor suppressor whose expression is lost during the progression of human PCa. Using immuno-histochemical analysis of human PCa tissue samples we found loss of Grb10 protein with increasing tumor grade. We next analyzed various components of insulin signaling, based on the evidence that Grb10 expression is negatively correlated with insulin signaling. We observed significant increase at both mRNA and protein levels of IR, IGF-1R, IRS-1 and IRS-2 in PCa cells and tissues that directly correlated with loss of Grb10. Recently, Grb10 expression was shown to be negatively correlated with PTEN levels in different cancer types including PCa. We determined the expression pattern of Grb10 mRNA in prostate tissue samples from 15-weeks old PTEN wild type (WT) and PTEN knockout (KO) mice and observed that Grb10 levels were significantly down-regulated in PTEN-KO mice suggesting that loss of PTEN results in loss of Grb10. Further analysis suggested increased insulin signaling in PTEN-KO mice compared to PTEN-WT mice confirming negative regulation of Grb10 with insulin signaling. To further understand the role of Grb10 in PCa, we overexpressed Grb10 in human PCa DU145 (PTEN-mutated) cells. Overexpression of Grb10 resulted in decrease in colony formation, migration and invasion that was associated with down-regulation of insulin signaling. In summary, our findings suggest that Grb10 is a negative regulator of insulin signaling whose expression is lost in PCa in humans and correlates well with disease progression and aggressiveness. We conclude that Grb10 is a tumor suppressor in human PCa whose loss promotes rapid progression of the disease. Identification of this novel role of Grb10 could open up new strategies for the management of human PCa.']",

        "Background":"['A central challenge in prostate cancer is identification of those men with prostate cancer whose disease will eventually progress to the lethal castration-resistant stage. Understanding molecular events leading to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and identifying new disease markers are critical for the development of improved therapies for such patients. Chromosomal rearrangements involving ETS transcription factors, such as ERG and ETV1, occur frequently in prostate cancer (PCa). It is widely presumed that ectopically expressed ETV1 (mainly due to gene fusions) plays a similar role in prostate tumorigenesis to that of ERG. However, we found that high levels of ETV1 expression are often associated with more advanced PCa in patient cohorts tested, whereas ERG overexpression is mainly associated with localized PCa and with elevated androgen receptor (AR) signaling. These data suggest that ETV1 and ERG may play different roles in prostate tumorigenesis. To address this question, we have generated Tmprss2-ERG (T-ERG) and Tmprss2-ETV1 (T-ETV1) knockin mouse models, targeting the two most prevalent ETS family members involved in fusions in PCa. Although, male mice carrying ERG or ETV1 targeted to the endogenous Tmprss2 locus alone are normal, either factor cooperated with Pten-loss, leading to localized cancer. Interestingly, only ETV1 supported development of advanced adenocarcinoma under Pten-loss background. To learn the molecular insights underlying this difference, we then focused mechanistic studies on the identification of chromosomal targets directly bound by ERG and ETV1. We showed that ERG and ETV1 control a common transcriptional network but largely in an opposing fashion. In particular, while ERG negatively regulates the AR transcriptional program, ETV1 cooperates with AR signaling by favoring its activation. Then, we performed microarray gene expression profiling for mouse prostate epithelial cells carrying T-ETV1 knockin allele alone. Strikingly, by gene set enrichment analysis, we found in T-ETV1 prostate cells (compared to controls), most top enriched gene sets from the KEGG pathway database are related to steroid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Consistent with this, when we castrated T-ETV1 knockin males, we found a significant portion of ETV1 expressing prostate cells (tracked by GFP expression) could survive castration long-term. Moreover, we found that ETV1 expression, but not that of ERG, promotes autonomous testosterone production. These data suggest that ETV1 may reprogram metabolism toward steroid synthesis, which may promote progression to castration-resistant state. Lastly, patient data confirmed association of ETV1 expression and androgen metabolism. Thus, the distinct biology of ETV1-associated prostate cancer suggests that this disease class may require new therapies directed to the underlying programs controlled by ETV1.']",

        "Background":"['Protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6) is an intracellular tyrosine kinase that is evolutionarily related to Src kinases. In the normal prostate, total and active PTK6 is localized within the nucleus, but nuclear localization is lost in prostate tumors. While the majority of total PTK6 is localized within the cytoplasm of PC3 cells, a human prostate cancer cell line, the active pool of PTK6 that is phosphorylated on tyrosine residue 342 is membrane associated. Ectopic expression of membrane targeted PTK6 leads to enhanced activation of PTK6 at the membrane and formation of peripheral adhesion complexes and increased migration of PC3 cells. Ectopic expression of PTK6 in SYF cells, a nontransformed mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking Src, Yes, and Fyn kinases leads to cell transformation and tumor growth in vivo. Ectopic expression of active membrane-targeted PTK6 in PC3 cells promotes the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). PTK6 regulates the EMT through AKT, as knockdown of AKT or inhibition of AKT activity by knockdown of p130CAS partially rescues the phenotype. PC3 cells expressing active membrane targeted PTK6 exhibit increased migration in vitro and form more metastases in a xenograft mouse model, while knockdown of PTK6 promotes an epithelial phenotype and impairs tumorigenesis in vivo. In prostates of Probasin-Cre, Pten flox/flox mice, striking activation of endogenous mouse PTK6 is observed at the membrane in Pten-null prostates, and this is accompanied by deregulated expression of E-cadherin and vimentin. We found a reverse correlation between PTK6 and E-cadherin expression in normal and metastatic human prostate cancer samples, and show PTK6 is activated at the membrane in some high-grade prostate tumors. Our studies reveal novel functions for PTK6 in prostate cancer, and define it as a potential therapeutic target.']",

        "Background":"['Despite significant progress in developing effective strategies for management of localized prostate cancer, the 5-year survival for metastatic castrate-resistant disease is less than 30%. Previous studies from our own and other laboratories showed the anti-tumorigenic potential of 2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME2) in various tumor models. Although variety of mechanisms including anti-angiogenic, pro-apoptotic, cell cycle deregulation has been reported to contribute to 2-ME2-mediated biological effects, the precise mechanism is unclear. To explore the role of 2-ME2, we carried out gene expression array analysis and discovered Recepteur dOrigine Nantais (RON) as one of the most significantly down regulated gene in response to 2-ME2 treatment. Subsequently, RON was found to be significantly upregulated in advanced-stage PCA cell lines, which do not express androgen receptor (AR); and high-grade human prostate tumors. Stable silencing of RON in androgen independent, PTEN-/- PC3 cells showed noticeable changes in cell morphology, actin filament organization, as well as markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In PTEN wild type DU145 cells, RON knockdown caused an increase in AR expression and promoter activity but decreased the transcriptional activation and expression of AR target genes such as PSA. In contrast, RON overexpression in androgen-responsive LNCAP cells leads to a suppression of the transcriptional activation of both AR and its downstream targets, including PSA. Furthermore, we found that RON silencing decreases expression and promoter activity of the anti-apoptotic protein FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) that is accompanied by the induction of apoptosis. In addition, intervention with 2-ME2 reduced tumor growth that is accompanied with decreased RON expression in the prostate in transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. These observations implicate RON as a hijacker of AR signaling that contributes in part to PCA growth. Therefore, restoration of native AR signaling via RON targeting could possibly be exploited in combination with antiandrogenic therapy to prevent recurrence of castrate-resistant prostate cancer.

The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of PTEN status on duration of response/time to progression in the expansion cohort, and to evaluate the impact of B on a PI3-kinase activation fingerprint in metastatic bone or lymph node tissue samples.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Integrin-mediated cellular adhesion to extracellular matrix components is a crucial regulator of tumor cell survival and chemoresistance. The integrin alpha 5 (ITGA5) plays a vital role in the migration and adhesion of prostate cancer (PCa) cells to fibronectin secreted by bone-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (Joshi, 2015), architects of a metastatic niche (Shiozawa, 2011). Hypothesis', ' The mechanism(s) whereby ITGA5 regulates the survival and chemoresistance in PCa may define novel therapeutic approaches. Methods and Results', ' To assess the pro-survival function of ITGA5 in PCa, we found that ITGA5 shRNA reduced bcl-2 and bcl-xl expression, and induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. In these PTEN-mutant (mt) AR-negative(-) cells, pharmacological inhibition of the PI3K signaling pathway (BKM120) in combination with ITGA5 knockdown synergistically induced apoptosis as assessed by induction of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP. Similarly, BKM120 in combination with pharmacological inhibition of bcl-2/bcl-xL (ABT263) also induced apoptosis in synergistic fashion in PC-3 cells. Synergistic apoptosis with PI3-kinase inhibitors (BKM120, pictilisib) and ABT-263 was restricted to PTEN-mt PC-3 and LNCaP cells and was not observed in PTEN-wt, AR- DU145 cells. The pan-Akt-inhibitor GDC-0068 in combination with ABT263 induced apoptosis specifically in PTEN-mt AR+ LNCaP and C4-2B cells. By contrast, there was diminished evidence of synergy of PI3-Kinase inhibitors and bcl-2 specific inhibition with ABT199 pointing toward the requirement of bcl-xl inhibition. However, resistance to longer-term therapy with PI3K and bcl-xl/bcl-2 inhibition was observed in PC-3 but not LNCaP cells. Although single-agent PI3K inhibitor therapy downregulates ITGA5 expression in PC-3 cells, by contrast bcl-2/bcl-xl inhibitor therapy, alone or in combination with PI3K inhibitor therapy, strongly upregulates ITGA5 expression together with Akt activation suggesting that ITGA5 represents a pathway of resistance to combinatorial therapy through feedback loop signals generated with bcl-xl inhibition. In support of this hypothesis, ITGA5 knockdown together with BKM120 and ABT263 combinatorial therapy blocked the upregulation of ITGA5 and associated Akt activation, further reduced bcl-xl expression, and enhanced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. In PTEN-wild type AR-positive VCAP cells, evidence for synergistic apoptosis with PI3K and bcl-2/bcl-xl inhibition was also obtained suggesting that the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion may phenocopy the pro-survival pathways of PTEN-deficient cells.

During past the 20 years we have established and characterized a large series of LuCaP prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Herein, we present a summary of the biological and molecular characterization of these PDX LuCaP models.LuCaP PCa PDX models were derived from primary PCa and various sites of metastases. The histology of the LuCaP PDXs is similar to the originating clinical specimen, and the unsupervised gene expression array clustering analyses revealed an association between the xenograft and the originating specimen. Twenty four of the lines are adenocarcinoma and four exhibit a neuroendocrine phenotype. Characterization of the LuCaP PDX tumors includes expression arrays, RNASeq, exome sequencing, and IHC for multiple markers. Some of the models show Rb deletion, TMPRSS2/ERG translocation, PTEN deletion, PI3K activation and other critical characteristics detected in clinical specimens and associated with PCa progression. In vivo characterizations show responses to androgen suppression spanning the range of responses to this therapy seen in patients; differential levels of serum PSA, tumor-doubling time, and responses to docetaxel. Furthermore, seven of our models elicit an osteoblastic reaction when implanted in the bone.In summary the diversity of phenotypes and responses of the LuCaP PDXs to therapy are representative of responses seen in the clinical setting.

MAPK has also been shown to increase the transcription of androgen-dependent (AR) genes, independently of androgens by phosphorylation of the AR or its cofactors. Thus, MAPK signal inhibition has the potential to be a therapeutic target for prostate cancer. To determine the clinical benefit of MAPK inhibition, we used the highly selective MEK inhibitor, AZD6244, in a prostate-specific PTEN-conditional knockout mouse model of prostate cancer. In this model, prostate tumors from mice exhibit increased levels of p-Erk1/2 expression that correlates with tumor progression. Acute pharmacodynamic responses, after a single dose of AZD6244, showed a strong inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation that was maintained for at least 24 hours after drug administration. Levels of cellular proliferation decreased, and apoptosis was induced shortly after the administration of AZD6244. However, apoptosis was suppressed after 8 hours. To further characterize the responses to MAPK signal inhibition, we examined the activity of downstream molecules of the PI3K/Akt and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways. While PI3K/Akt activity decreased mildly, activation of JAK/STAT3 was transiently but strongly increased. To determine tumor responses to chronic administration of AZD6244, Pten-mutant mice harboring prostate tumors were treated with AZD6244 for 4 a period of 4 weeks. 2-D morphometric analysis of tumor surface area showed a reduction of 10.9% (P =0.035) in treated mice.

The clinical success of PD-L1 inhibitors has accelerated the development of drugs also targeting PD-L2 and B7-H3.

Here, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of PD-L1, PD-L2 and B7-H3 in our large prostate cancer prognosis tissue microarray (TMA) containing tissue samples from more than 17,000 patients. Normal prostate glands were negative for PD-L1 and B7-H3, but positive for PD-L2. We found that 47% of 12,808 interpretable cancers showed B7-H3 expression, and 92% of 9,463 cancers showed PD-L2 expression, while expression of PD-L1 was virtually absent (0.2% of 17,392 tumors) in epithelial cells. Stroma cells and immune cells were entirely negative for PD-L1 and B7-H3, while some faint staining of lymphocytes was occasionally observed for PD-L2. In cancers, PD-L2 and B7-H3 staining had different prognostic impact, which depended on the ERG status', ' B7-H3 expression was linked to young patient age, advanced stage, high Gleason grade, lymph node metastasis (p<0.0001 each), presence of PTEN deletion (p<0.0001), and poor prognosis in ERG negative cancers (p<0.0001), while PD-L2 expression was linked to beneficial tumor features and good prognosis exclusively in tumors with ERG fusion (p<0.0001). In a multivariate analysis including pT stage, Gleason grade, nodal stage, resection margin and preoperative PSA level, B7-H3 expression was an independent prognostic factor (p=0.0004). In summary, the results of our study identify a subset of young patients with ERG negative aggressive prostate cancers that might benefit from anti-B7-H3 therapy in the future. PD-L2 expression appears to protect tumors from progression and does not seem to be suitable as a potential target in prostate cancer.

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer is highly dependent on androgen receptor (AR) and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways for survival and disease progression. Preclinical evidence suggests that combinatorial approaches targeting both AR and PI3K/AKT activity improves treatment efficacy. However, sustained responses from traditional and next-generation anti-androgen therapies targeting AR remain elusive in clinical practice due to inherent/acquired resistance resulting in lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Mechanisms for continued AR transcriptional activity may be ligand dependent or independent but still require AR gene expression. Persistent AR gene expression is a key feature of CRPC. Thus, blocking AR gene expression by antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) is a logical approach to CRPC. We previously showed that monotherapy with ISIS581088, a generation 2.5 ASO targeting mouse AR, demonstrated strong antitumor activity in a transgenic mouse model of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer. In this study we show the antitumor effects of combined therapy of ISIS581088 and AZD5363, a potent AKT inhibitor and demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of combination therapy in a clinically relevant mouse model of CRPC. Sixteen-week-old mice with PTEN-/- castration-naïve prostate tumors were treated with ISIS581088 and AZD5363 alone or in combination for four weeks. Tumor growth inhibition rates were 41.2%, 20.2% and 54.4% for ISIS581088, AZD5363 and ISIS581088/AZD5363 treatment groups, respectively, P<0.001. In a model of mouse CRPC, 16-week-old mice with PTEN-/- castration-resistant prostate tumors (eight weeks post castration) experienced reduced tumor burden with all treatments but no enhancement was observed when the compounds were administered in combination compared with monotherapy drug treatments. In a randomized trial of advanced CRPC in PTEN/P53 double knockout mice, combination therapy significantly increased overall survival. Median survival were 18, 17 21, 22, and 38 days for control vehicle, control ASO, ISIS581088, AZD5363 and ISIS581088/AZD5363 treatment groups, respectively, P=0.041. In conclusion, our data shows that combination therapy significantly reduced tumor burden in mice with castration-naïve tumors compared to those treated with monotherapy.

Still, combination therapy demonstrated a clear advantage in prolonging overall survival in a long-term randomized mouse trial of PTEN/P53-deficient CRPC. Thus, our data provides preclinical evidence to support that next generation ASOs targeting AR in combination with AKT inhibition is a potentially effective treatment approach for CRPC.']",

A phase II randomized discontinuation trial of cabo showed clinical activity in CRPC patients. However, not all patients responded to cabo, and most of the responding patients eventually experienced disease progression. The objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of cabo in a preclinical setting using xenograft models of CRPC with differential phenotypes to obtain insight into which tumor types might be sensitive to cabo, and to investigate mechanisms of action of this agent.We used LuCaP 35CR, a PTEN- ERG+ Rb+ CRPC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) that exhibits amplification of the androgen receptor (AR); LuCaP 96CR, a PTEN+ ERG- Rb+ CRPC PDX with high levels of intra-tumoral androgens; LuCaP 86.2, a PTEN- ERG+ Rb- CRPC PDX that expresses the AR v5-7 variant and is not responsive to endocrine therapy; and LuCaP 93, a PTEN- ERG- Rb- neuroendocrine CRPC PDX. Expression of cabo targets in these models was determined by qPCR. Animals were treated with 30 mg/kg cabo p.o. for six weeks (5d on/2d off), and tumor volume (TV), serum PSA and body weights were monitored. IHC and expression arrays were used to analyze effects of cabo. Cabo was effective in halting tumor growth in all four PDXs. Significant inhibition of TV was evident after one week of cabo treatment compared to control groups. PSA values were also significantly lower after one week of the treatment in all three adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, cabo treatment resulted in significant survival benefits in LuCaP 35CR, LuCaP 96CR and LuCaP 93 without significant decreases in body weight. IHC analysis showed decreased microvessel density in all cabo-treated groups vs control groups, suggesting effects on tumor environment. qPCR analysis showed that all models expressed some cabo targets though at different levels, but we did not observe any associations between magnitude of cabo effects and levels of the its targets in the tumors; inhibition of LuCaP 93, which expresses the highest levels of cabo targets, was similar to that of LuCaP 96CR, which expresses low levels of cabo targets. Our analyses of expression profiles of tumors following cabo treatment showed very little overlap between the models. However, E2F1 signaling, was inhibited by cabo in Rb- PDXs LuCaP 93 and LuCaP 86.2, but not in the Rb+ PDXs LuCaP 35CR and LuCaP 96CR. Also, expression of genes regulated by androgen was increased in the Rb- tumors and decreased (LuCaP 35CR) or was not altered (LuCaP 96CR) in the Rb+ tumors, and the levels of nuclear AR showed a similar pattern.

The Canadian Prostate Cancer Genome Network (CPC-GENE) - a member of the International Cancer Genome Consortium - aims to identify multi-modal prognostic and predictive signatures of therapeutic outcome based on intrinsic tumour genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, which are being incorporated into novel clinical trials of treatment escalation/de-escalation for image-guided radiotherapy and/or radical prostatectomy. Herein we report the results of the largest prostate cancer whole-genome sequencing study to date, consisting of 194 patients and whole-exome sequencing of 479 patients with localized, potentially curable disease; a sample size that allows for saturating discovery of genes mutated at 1% frequency. We show that tumours treated by curative local therapy have a paucity of clinically-actionable mutations relative to high-risk localized or metastatic disease, but instead harbor a significant number of recurrent non-coding aberrations and genomic rearrangements, including a novel inversion - and an associated reduction in gene expression - of the PTEN tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 10. The median tumour contains three distinct driver mutations, with >86% of tumours possessing at least one known driver. Importantly, multiple driver aberrations are associated with patient outcome, including copy number aberrations and methylation events, but notably excluding well-described recurrent events such as TMPRSS2', 'ERG fusions and SPOP point mutations. Localized hypermutation events (e.g. kataegis) were detected in >20% of tumours, and were strongly enriched for aggressive disease. Taken together, these data provide a comprehensive analysis of the genomic landscape of localized, non-indolent prostate cancer. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that specific molecular aberrations may serve as useful biomarkers for improved pre-treatment stratification of patients with localized, low/intermediate risk disease into escalation/de-escalation protocols, and support the development of clinical trials to assess this hypothesis, based on patient-specific molecular profiles.']",

We aimed to molecularly characterize novel CTC candidates utilizing the Epic Sciences platform, which performs no physical selection.  Methods', '  Blood from 10 healthy volunteers (HV) and 39 patients (pts) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) were collected and shipped to Epic Sciences, where all nucleated cells were plated onto glass slides and subjected to immunofluorescence (IF) staining and CTC identification by fluorescent scanners and algorithms.

Candidate CK- CTC populations were identified as CK-CD45- that were morphologically malignant. Small nuclear size candidate CTCs were identified as CK+CD45- cells with diameters similar to or smaller than that of a typical white blood cells (WBCs).

We have previously reported that loss or reduce of OLFM4 expression is associated with the progression of human prostate cancer. We further found that loss of Olfm4 leads to prostate neoplastic progression in the Olfm4-knockout mouse model.To study the clinical impacts of OLFM4 gene in the prostate cancer, we have performed bioinformatics analysis from the published datasets, GSE35988, GSE21032 and TCGA as well as immunohistochemical analysis with prostate cancer tissue arrays by using OLFM4 antibody. The copy number variations (CNV) of OLFM4 gene were significantly associated with Gleason scores of prostate cancer.

We have observed consist reduce or loss of mRNA expression in the castrate resistant and metastatic prostate cancer patient samples. To study the relationship between OLFM4 expression and prostate cancer recurrence, we performed Kaplan-Meier Plots and Log-rank statistic analysis for GSE21032 and TCGA data sets. Overall, there was no significant relationship between OLFM4 expression and prostate cancer recurrence. However, when analysis was restricted to the lower quartile of OLFM4 expression, we obtained a highly significant inverse relationship (p = 0.02) between OLFM4 expression and recurrence. We also observed that alteration of CNV and expression of OLFM4 gene has no relationship with the level of (patient) serum prostate specific antigen (PSA).We performed immunohistochemical analysis with prostate cancer tissue arrays by using OLFM4, PSA and E-cadherin antibodies. Lower or loss of expression of OLFM4 protein is associated with advanced Gleason scores of prostate cancer specimens.

While studies in large cohorts of prostate cancers treated by radical prostatectomy have demonstrated that ERG fusion alone has no impact on patient outcome, there is growing evidence that the prognostic relevance of many other biomarkers may be different in cancers with and without ERG fusion. In order to better understand the impact of the ERG status on the prognostic relevance of prostate cancer biomarkers, we took advantage of our molecular database obtained from immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses of more than 50 markers with respect to expression levels and gene copy number changes in 13,665 prostate cancers that had been assembled in a tissue microarray (TMA) format. Markers with strongest associations to presence of ERG fusion included CRISP3, HOOK3, RBM3, LPCAT1, BAZ2A, and deletions of 3p and PTEN (p<0.0001 each). Markers with strongest associations to absence of ERG fusion included SPINK1 and deletions of 6q and 5q (p<0.0001 each). Alterations of 47 markers were linked to reduced time to biochemical recurrence if all cancers were analyzed regardless if the ERG status. However, subset analyses revealed, that the prognostic relevance of 18 (38%) of these 47 markers was driven either by the subset of ERG positive (n = 7) or ERG negative cancers only (n = 11). Combined analysis of these markers identified ERG status dependent molecular classifiers that provided prognostic information exclusively in ERG negative or in ERG positive prostate cancers. Multivariate modeling indicated that the classifiers were independent of established prognostic factors, including pre-surgical (PSA, Gleason grade on biopsy, clinical stage) and post-surgical (pT stage, Gleason of the radical prostatectomy, nodal stage, resection margin stage) parameters. In conclusion, the results of our study demonstrate that the impact of many candidate prognostic markers in prostate cancer strongly depends on the ERG status. Our growing molecular database attached to more than 13,000 prostate cancers allows for the continuous validation of candidate prognostic markers and their impact in molecularly defined subsets of the disease.']",

To accomplish this goal, we carried out a series of experiments using a genetically engineered mouse model of prostate cancer driven by the conditional inactivation of PTEN. High levels of Pim-1 were observed during the early stages of the tumorigenesis process which decreased as tumors progressed. Expression of Pim-1 was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), well-differentiated, and moderately-differentiated tumors. In poorly-differentiated tumors, Pim-1expression was heterogeneously expressed at lower levels and was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm of cancer cells. Levels of Pim-1 expression were increased in tumors from mice after surgical castration. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of Pim-1as a target for prostate cancer, we tested the antitumor effects of AZD1208, a highly potent Pim kinase inhibitor, on a panel of cell lines derived from castration-nave and castration-resistant mouse prostate cancer.

Dietary composition, in addition to other factors, may contribute to this geographic disparity. Cholesterol, the precursor for de novo steroid hormone synthesis, has been hypothesized to promote PC growth via multiple pathways including intratumoral steroidogenesis. While lowering serum cholesterol slows xenograft PC growth, this has not been tested in transgenic models, which allow testing of PC prevention as well as modulating PC growth in an orthotopic position. We determined the effect of cholesterol uptake inhibition, using ezetimibe, on PC growth in Hi-Myc and PTEN transgenic mice.Methods', ' We randomized 50 c-myc/wt (Hi-Myc) mice and 30 PTENloxP/loxP-Cre+ (PTEN) to one of two diets', ' high fat high cholesterol (HFHC; 40% fat, 17% protein, 43% carbohydrate, 1.25% cholesterol), or HFHC with ezetimibe (30 mg/kg food) (HFHC+Z). Mice were fed ad libitum starting right after weaning and body weights measured twice weekly. Prostate, liver, spleen, adipose tissue and serum were harvested from Hi-Myc and PTEN mice at age 6 and 4 months, respectively.

In PTEN mice, there was no difference in body weights between groups, but prostate weight was significantly lower in the HFHC+Z group, relative to the HFHC group (p=0.046). In Hi-Myc mice, while serum T levels did not vary between groups (p=0.93), tumor T, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and androstenedione concentrations were significantly reduced in the HFHC+Z group, relative to the HFHC group (p=0.01, p=0.01, p=0.006, respectively).Discussion', ' Reduction of serum cholesterol levels using cholesterol uptake inhibitor, ezetimibe, significantly reduced prostate weight in PTEN mice consuming a HFHC diet. Furthermore, supplementation of the HFHC diet with ezetimibe significantly reduced tumor concentrations of T, DHT and androstenedione in Hi-Myc mice, although there was no effect on prostate weight. These findings highlight a potentially critical role for cholesterol in PC progression by providing evidence that reduction of hypercholesterolemia may reduce intratumoral de novo steroidogenesis and slow PC growth.

The current study was undertaken, to determine whether (and how) factoring in molecular markers could further improve the predictive power. We selected deletions of PTEN and 6q (by FISH analysis) as well as DNA ploidy information obtained by flow cytometry as examples for established molecular prognostic markers that provided strong and independent prognostic information in our study cohort of more than 17,000 prostate cancers. A “molecular score” was established for these markers including “penalty” points for presence of deletions/aneuploidy and “bonus” points for lack of deletions/diploid DNA status. Penalty and bonus points were separately determined for each parameter based on differences in the recurrence rate between cancers with and without deletions or aneuploidy. The “penalty” points were then added to the IQ-Gleason score points while the “bonus” points were subtracted from the IQ-Gleason in order to obtain the MiQ-Gleason score. The MiQ-Gleason provided strong prognostic information in univariate analysis (p<0.0001) and in multivariate models including PSA level, pT / pN stage, and status of the resection margin. Comparison of Reciever Operator characteristics (ROS) between the MiQ-Gleason and the quantitative Gleason or classical Gleason revealed only a slight increase of the prognostic power for the MiQ-Gleason (AUC=0.781) as compared to the IQ-Gleason (AUC=0.771), while a massive difference was found as compared to the classical Gleason grade groups (AUC=0.719). In summary, our data demonstrate the power of quantitative Gleason scoring strategies as compared to classical Gleason grade groups. That adding selected molecular features improved predicitive power only slightly demonstrates how difficult it is for molecular markers to compete with optimized morphological grading systems.

By utilizing carefully annotated specimens, this study focused on the discovery of recurrent genomic alterations in CaP of AA men in comparison to Caucasian Americans (CA).METHODS', ' Genomic DNA from clinically localized primary prostate tumors (Gleason 6 or 7 with primary pattern 3) and matched peripheral blood lymphocytes of seven AA and seven CA patients, were analyzed by paired-end sequencing on Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx to a depth of 30x. Following alignment to reference genome, somatic alterations on tumor DNA that include single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion and deletions (Indels), structural variations, copy number variations, and inter- and intra-chromosomal translocations of tumor DNA sequence were identified. To confirm prevalent genomic deletions we performed FISH analysis on a tissue microarray constructed from 42 AA and 59 CA tumor and normal samples of an independent cohort. Frequently deleted loci were further validated by analysis of TCGA CaP SNP array data from 41 AA and 279 CA prostate tumors.RESULTS', ' A comparative evaluation of whole genome sequences of AA and CA CaP revealed a prevalent deletion of the LSAMP locus of chromosome 3q13.31 in AA CaP.

In contrast to higher frequency of LSAMP deletion, significantly lower frequencies of PTEN and ERG alterations were noted in CaP of AA men. Furthermore, CaP genomes of AA men displayed a higher rate of inter-chromosomal rearrangements than those from CA men.CONCLUSIONS', ' We highlight distinct features of AA and CA CaP genomes including common CaP driver genes (TMPRSS2- ERG, PTEN) and define a novel recurrent deletion of the LSAMP locus.

Tumor initiating cells (TICs) are capable of self-renewal and comprise a subset of the tumor mass. These cells are proposed to drive the growth and metastasis of tumors, and are considered to be resistant to traditional cytotoxic and targeted therapies. Several studies have shown that NF-κB signaling is increased in recurrent prostate cancer and enriched in prostate TICs. We sought to determine the potential of an IKK/NF-κB-driven mechanism for inherent or acquired resistance by IKK-mediated control of a subset of prostate tumor initiating cells. These studies were performed by using established prostate cancer cell lines, murine prostate organoids, and a murine prostate cancer animal model. We have found that inhibition of IKKα and IKKβ, upstream regulators of noncanonical and canonical NF-κB signaling, block self-renewal of several PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we have also found that IKK is important for tumorigenicity and stemness seen in prostate cancer cells as measured by colony formation and extreme limiting dilution assays. Loss of canonical NF-κB (p65/RelA) decreased stemness while loss of noncanonical did not alter tumorsphere formation. Interestingly, Pten-/- tumors with loss of Ikkα or Ikkβ displayed decreased levels of self-renewing cells as measured by CD49fhigh expression, a known prostate basal cell marker. Isolated murine Pten-/- cells were 2x more efficient than Pten-/-Ikkα-/- or Pten-/-Ikkβ-/- cells in forming prostate organoids suggesting that loss of Ikk decreased the number of self-renewing cells needed for formation. Taken together, we conclude that IKK-mediated signaling is important for maintenance of prostate tumor initiating cells and further studies will address whether IKK-mediated signaling provides a mechanism for evading current therapies.']",

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer (CaP) is the most commonly diagnosed non-cutaneous cancer and the second highest contributor to cancer-related deaths in U.S. men. Localized CaP has a 5-year survival rate of approximately 100%, but disseminated, metastatic disease (mCaP) dramatically reduces 5-year survival to <30%. A known driving force in the progression of CaP is activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway through loss of PTEN, with widespread effects on cell proliferation and migration. Additional genomic changes, such as the loss of TP53 or RB1, or the upregulation of MYC, correlate with increased incidence and aggressiveness of mCaP. However, only a fraction of men with high levels of circulating and disseminated CaP cells progress to overt, macro-metastatic disease - the lethal phenotype in CaP. Importantly, little is known regarding the drivers of indolent vs. aggressive mCaP. We used two transgenic (Tg) mouse models of mCaP with clinically relevant genetic alterations which exhibit Akt activation and Rb1 loss, yet one produces indolent mCaP and the other, systemic aggressive mCaP. Specifically, mice lacking Rb1 and the metastasis-suppressor, SSeCKS/Akap12, develop high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN) and disseminated disease in the lymph nodes whereas those lacking Pten and Rb1 develop CaP and aggressive mCaP. The metastasis-suppressing functions of Akap12 relates to its ability to scaffold Src and PKC, thereby attenuating their oncogenic signaling pathways. We will show data suggesting that the pathological differences between these two Tg models is based on the differential use of PI3K-p110 and Akt isoforms, with aggressiveness correlating with the downregulation of Smad4, a known metastasis-suppressor in Tg CaP models. Additionally, differences in Akt isoform usage likely controls the expression of neurogenesis genes that are especially upregulated in castration-recurrent CaP that fails second-line androgen receptor antagonist inhibitors such as enzalutamide. By comparing the differential transcriptomes and signaling networks in primary-site tumors, lymph node metastases, and CaP cell lines derived from these two Tg models, several new potential therapeutic targets have been identified that could be exploited to prevent or treat aggressive mCaP.']",

The real-time PCR results indicated that the expression levels of genes Pten, LIPA, and ABCA1 are obviously lower in high grade than in low grade PCa (not obviously for ACAT1).

Strikingly, genetic ablation of IL-6 strongly promoted prostate cancer initiation, progression and metastasis in Pten-deficient mice. Mechanistically, IL6/Stat3 signaling regulates p19Arf-p53-induced senescence by modulating expression of the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 in pre-neoplastic cells.

Furthermore, ROS contributes to the delicate balance between tumor cell survival and death. However, the mechanisms by which tumor cells decide to elicit survival or death signals during oxidative stress are not completely understood. We have previously reported that ROS enhanced tumorigenic functions in prostate cancer cells, such as cell migration and invasion, which depended on CXCR4 and AKT signaling. Here, we report a novel mechanism by which ROS facilitated cell death through activation of AKT. We initially observed that ROS increased expression of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) in 22Rv1 human prostate cancer cells. The tumor suppressor PTEN, a negative regulator of AKT signaling, was rendered catalytically inactive through oxidation by ROS, although the expression levels remained consistent. Despite these events, cells still underwent apoptosis. Further investigation into apoptosis revealed that expression of the tumor suppressor pVHL increased, with concomitant decreased expression of HIF1. Further investigation into pVHL during apoptosis revealed that the tumor suppressor becomes phosphorylated at S111 prior to activity; S111 is within a target motif (RXXS) forphosphorylation by AKT kinase. We then determined that pVHL and p-AKT associated in vitro via co-immunoprecipitation assay. Moreover, knockdown of pVHL by siRNA rescued HIF1 protein expression and rescued cells from apoptosis, which was determined by Annexin-V and cleaved-PARP. Collectively, our study suggests that in the context of oxidative stress, activatedAKT facilitated apoptosis by inducing pVHL function. Moreover, our studies suggest a novel paradigm for AKT-that it may participate in tumor suppressor rather than oncogenesis.']",

Increasing evidence also suggests that autophagy is induced during therapeutic stress and is believed to promote drug resistance limiting the treatment efficacy of anticancer drugs. Our goal was to define the role of autophagy during prostate cancer tumorigenesis and determine the consequences of pharmacological intervention. We used a genetically engineered mouse model of prostate cancer that is based on the PSA-Cre driven inactivation of PTEN to show that autophagy is induced during tumor progression and the transformation to castration resistant prostate cancer. We also report that inhibition of autophagy by the conditional inactivation of ATG7, a gene essential for autophagosome formation, does not contribute to initiate prostate cancer. However, simultaneous inactivation of ATG7 and PTEN leads to suppressed tumor progression in castration-nave and CRPC models. Additionally PTEN/ATG7 double gene knockout mice were more sensitive to targeted mTOR inhibition than PTEN single gene knockouts. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy using the lysomotropic agent chloroquine synergized with everolimus to inhibit survival of human and mouse prostate cancer cells in vitro. Despite a strong antitumor activity in vitro, the combinations of everolimus and chloroquine failed to demonstrate any meaningful improvement over everolimus alone when tested in vivo with PTEN-mutant mice. In summary, our findings demonstrate that autophagy is required for prostate cancer progression and contributes to therapeutic resistance; however, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy, using a lysomotropic agent, was ineffective in producing a meaningful antitumor benefit in an autochthonous cancer system.

However, it invariably acquires resistance to androgen withdrawal leading to the recurrence of the castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Androgen receptor (AR) activity that is necessary for the normal prostate development remains active through both phases of the disease. Even at castrate levels of androgen AR remains functional, possibly through several non-mutually exclusive mechanisms including expression of constitutively active AR variants (ARVs). The full-length of AR (ARFL) is a 110 KDa nuclear hormone receptor composed of an N-terminal domain (NTD, exon1), DNA-binding domain (DBD, exon 2 and 3), a hinge region (exon 4), and the C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD, exon 4-8). To date up to 15 different ARVs lacking LBD have been identified in human prostate cancer cell lines or specimens. It is thought that the altered biological properties of these ARVs may be, in part, correlated to the development of castration resistance. ARVs remain understudied in mouse prostate cancer cell lines; detection of only two ARVs was reported in a mouse cell line. A better definition of ARVs in distinct phases of this cancer in an appropriate mouse model should be valuable for insights into the role of ARVs in therapy and disease progression.To this end, by using cell lines established from the conditional Pten deletion mouse model of prostate adenocarcinoma, we detected low molecular weight AR protein species (50 kDa - 80 kDa) besides the presence of the 110 kDa full-length. We performed 3RACE and subsequent Sanger sequencing on cell lines derived from both ADCa (E-series) and CRPC stages (cE-series) and identified three different ARVs which we named as mARV-abc. Structurally, mARVa is analogous to the previously reported mAR-V4 and the human ARV567es which only lacks LBD domain retaining exon 1-4 followed by the inclusion of a cryptic exon 4 from intron 4 at the 3-terminal sequence. More interestingly, we identified two novel ARV isoforms (mARV-b and -c) which merely contains the NTD encoded by exon 1 before the addition of specific sequences from different positions of intron 1. Although these mARVs occur in all the murine cell lines tested, their proportion appears to vary with respect to the stage of the disease from which the cell lines originated. In cE-series established from a CRPC tumor, novel ARVb and ARVc are more abundant than that in E-series from an ADCa tumor; in parallel, ARVa displays an opposite expression profile. These new findings together with the results of ongoing experiments, including the single cell expression analysis and on their biological activities of the splice variants will be discussed.']",

Multiple approved therapies target the androgen signaling axis in this metastatic disease, however, after advancing to the androgen-independent stage, PCa is unresponsive to androgen ablation therapy and is refractory to further curative treatment. Recent advances have demonstrated that two intracellular signaling pathways promote prostate cancer progression, one is the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) pathway included multiple FGFs and 4 kinds of FGF receptors (FGFR), which remains activated in the cancer cells, the other is the oncogenic PI3K/AKT pathway, which is constantly active due to the loss of an important tumor suppressor gene. Targeted inhibition of FGF and AKT signaling pathways has shown promising both in vitro and in vivo studies. However, FGFR or AKT inhibitor, as a single agent, would result in a reciprocal feedback loop. Therefore, it is imperative that both pathways be targeted simultaneously in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. In this study, we evaluated the effect of combined treatment of FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 and AKT inhibitor AZD5363 on PCa progression. Proliferation assay shows that AZD4547 just weakly, or not inhibits PCa cell proliferation, AZD5363 significantly inhibits PCa cell proliferation; the combined treatment of AZD4547 and AZD5363 shows similar inhibition effect to AZD5363. Both AZD4547 and AZD5363 inhibit PCa cell anchorage-independent growth and invasion, which are synergistically decrease by the combined treatment. AZD4547 significantly inhibits phosporylation of FGFR1 and FGFR4 in PCa cells; AZD5363 increases FGFR1 and FGFR4 phosphorylation, which was significantly repressed in combined treatment. The activation of FGFR2, MEK1/2, and Erk1/2 in PCa cells was remarkably inhibited by AZD4547 but increased by AZD5363, and synergistically inhibited by the combined treatment.

Its locus at 13q21 is frequently deleted in human prostate cancer, suggesting a tumor suppressor function. Our previous study showed that TGF-beta, which is a differentiation signal for normal proliferating progenitor cells, acetylates KLF5 to reverse its function. Unacetylated KLF5 (unAc-KLF5) is pro-proliferative but acetylated KLF5 (Ac-KLF5) works with TGF- to inhibit cell proliferation. Here we generated a Klf5-floxed mouse strain in which exons 2 and 3 of Klf5 are flanked by loxP sequences. By crossing Klf5-floxed mice with PB-Cre4 transgenic mice, we were able to delete the Klf5 gene specifically in prostatic epithelial cells. Because knockout of both Pten alleles induces prostate carcinoma, we also crossed Klf5-floxed mice with Pten-floxed mice to investigate Klf5 function in tumor progression. At different time points, prostates were collected and histological and molecular analyses were performed. We found that knockout of one Klf5 allele mainly increased cell proliferation and caused epithelial hyperplasia but was insufficient to initiate prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). On the other hand, knockout of both Klf5 alleles mainly induced apoptosis in prostate epithelia. When combined with Pten knockout, the apoptosis was prevented due to the activation of PI3K survival signaling, making Klf5 null cells survive. With the deletion of one Pten allele, Klf5 deletion significantly increased cell proliferation and promoted the development of hyperplasia and PIN. When both Pten alleles were deleted, Klf5 deletion significantly enhanced tumor development, as indicated by increased tumor size and elimination of luminal structures. Immunohistochemical staining proved that cell cycle regulator p15 was downregulated in Klf5 knockout mice. Deletion of Klf5 also significantly induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 MAPK and further increased Akt activity. In normal prostates, total Klf5 was detected in both luminal and basal cells of the prostate, while unAc-Klf5 and Ac-Klf5 were detected in basal and luminal cells respectively. In addition, oncogenic signals, such as Pten knockout, reduced Ac-Klf5 in differentiated luminal cells. In conclusion, deletion of Klf5 promotes cell proliferation and makes cells susceptible to other factor-induced carcinogenesis in the prostate, probably because of impaired proliferation-inhibitory function of Ac-Klf5.']",

        "Background":"['Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective treatment for metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa), but patients eventually relapse with ADT resistant disease. Well-characterized mechanisms of ADT resistance include AR amplification, intra-tumoral androgen synthesis, AR splice variants, and growth receptor bypass. All of these mechanisms function to maintain sufficient AR signaling for tumor growth and survival. Improved ADT like abiraterone acetate (AA) and enzalutamide (Enza) were developed to combat such resistance mechanisms associated with alterations in androgen receptor or androgen metabolism. While AA and Enza extend survival, clinical benefits are short-lived. A new form of resistance is increasingly appreciated in patients relapsing from AA or Enza, histologic transformation of prostate adenocarcinoma (PADC) to neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) variants. NEPC is lethal and the survival time is less than a year as effective targeted therapy is unavailable. NEPC typically exhibits reduced AR expression, increased expression of neuroendocrine markers, and visceral metastasis in the absence of rising PSA. Of note, NEPC possesses the similar genome rearrangements with adjacent PADC cells, indicating they share clonal origin. Thus, NEPC may arise by histologic transformation of PADC. Underlying mechanisms of histologic transformation are not understood and experimental models are limited, hindering development of effective remedies. RB1 loss is common in NEPC, but rare in PADC; genetic profiling shows human NEPC exhibit elevated levels of several epigenetic modifiers. We hypothesize that transdifferentiation from PADC to NEPC in the context of RB1 loss is due to epigenetic alterations and can be reversed or blocked by epigenetic targeted therapies. We established several genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) to test the role of Rb1, and we find Rb1 loss causes metastatic progression of PADC initiated by Pten deficiency. This Rb1/Pten deficient (DKO) PADC exhibits expression markers for both PADC and NEPC as seen in human patients. Yet, these tumors are sensitive to ADT but relapse with low AR expression and acquired Trp53 mutations. RNA profiling demonstrates the phenotype of DKO tumors is similar to human NEPC. Both human and mouse NEPC is accompanied by increased expression of epigenetic reprogramming factors like Sox2 and Ezh2. Clinically relevant Ezh2 inhibitors GSK126 and EPZ6438 can restore Enza sensitivity by reversing neuroendocrine transformation. This finding has been genetically validated using short-hairpin RNA(shRNA) in vitro. These results uncover genetic mutations driving prostate cancer lineage plasticity and suggest an epigenetic approach for extending the clinical benefits of ADT.']",

However, there are no clinical tests or factors that can reliably predict treatment responses for the advanced prostate cancer patients. Examination of tumor component in circulation, also known as liquid biopsy, has shown promise for predicting treatment outcomes and survival. To capture the tumor-derived genomic alterations and decrease the surrogacy of using PSA measurements as is currently performed, we propose a Plasma Genomic Abnormality (PGA) score and Treatment Efficacy (TEff) index based on copy number variations as estimated by cell free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma. We first performed whole genome and targeted sequencing (NimbleGen comprehensive cancer panel) to examine plasma cfDNA for tumor-associated genetic and genomic aberrations in 10 HSPC patients receiving ADT and 10 CRPC patients receiving chemotherapy. For each patient, we tested plasma from two time points', ' pre-treatment and 4 months post-treatment. We then calculated the PGA score by summing the most significant genomic abnormalities with higher PGA score indicating greater tumor DNA content in cfDNA. TEff index was derived from comparison of PGA score difference between treatments with higher TEff index reflecting a better treatment response. The sequencing-based copy number analysis revealed locus-specific gains or losses including those previously reported in prostate cancers, such as 8q gains, AR amplifications, PTEN losses and TMPRSS2-ERG fusions. We found that overall PGA score was significantly higher in CRPC patients than in HSPC patients (p<0.0005), possibly reflecting increased tumor burden during the disease progression. Patients with low TEff index often demonstrated poor response to treatments, and patients with high initial PGA score or low TEff index tended to have poor overall survival. As examples of the PGA-based TEff associations with outcome we presented three CRPC patients including two with neuro-endocrine origin (small cell carcinoma). Comparison of mutational profiles between pre- and post-treatments showed that treatments caused more diverse gene mutations, in particular, in the genes involving androgen biosynthesis, AR activation, DNA repair and chemotherapy resistance, suggesting subclonal evolution of heterogeneous tumor genomes in response to these treatments. Our results strongly support the feasibility of using non-invasive liquid biopsy as a potential powerful tool to study biological mechanisms underlying therapy-specific resistance and monitor disease progression in the advanced prostate cancer.

Hormonal therapy such as androgen ablation often fails as cancer cells utilize alternative mechanisms for survival and eventually progress to castrate resistant PCa. Currently, understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying castrate resistant PCa development is limited. Strong evidence demonstrates that castrate resistant PCa continues to depend on androgen receptor signaling. Novel compounds targeting androgen receptor activity and androgen synthesis are currently under investigation in preclinical and clinical studies; however alternate therapeutic approaches for castrate resistant PCa are needed. Heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an abundant molecular chaperone and plays a crucial role in structural formation and folding of a variety of proteins including androgen receptor, Akt, and other oncogenic proteins. Inhibition of Hsp90 creates the potential to suppress tumor activity as enforced disassociation induces proteosomal degradation of Hsp90 client proteins. This study utilized four genetically defined murine PCa epithelial cell lines, MYC-CaP (AR+ amplified, Pten +), MYC-Cap css (Castrate resistant, AR= amplified, Pten+), Pten-CaP E2 (Androgen sensitive, AR+, Pten null), and Pten-CaP cE2 (Castrate resistant, AR+, Pten null) to investigate the cellular response to Hsp90 inhibition. Cells were exposed in vitro to NVP-AUY922, a novel Hsp90 inhibitor at increasing concentrations for 24 and 48 hours. Results demonstrated that AUY922 treatment induced reduction in overall growth in all cell lines, with Pten-CaP and castrate resistant Pten-CaP being more sensitive (IC50 = 10nM) than MYC-CaP and MYC-Cap css (IC50 = 25nM) cells. Inhibition of cell growth was also indicated by induced cell cycle arrest in all cell lines, though AUY922 treatment did not result in significant increase in cell membrane permeability. Overall, our preliminary data indicates that AUY922 exhibits strong anti-growth effects in PCa cell lines and warrants further investigation as a potential novel targeted therapy to treat advanced and castrate resistant PCa.']",

Selinexor is an orally bioavailable XPO1 inhibitor that represents a novel class of small molecule compounds with potent activity against a wide variety of cancers. Here we report the activity of Selinexor against Castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).CRPC progression is mediated by activation of various adaptive Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling pathways. These pathways are currently being targeted by novel anti-androgen therapies such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide with favorable outcomes. However, resistance to anti-androgen therapy can be developed through deregulation of tumor suppressor pathways. XPO-1 is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and therefore we tested the effects of Selinexor on CRPC cells and tumors models. Treatment of the C4-2B prostate cancer cell line with Selinexor in vitro significantly inhibited cell proliferation and resulted in nuclear accumulation of p53 and p21. In addition, Selinexor inhibited expression of the tumor-promoting gene Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme E2C (UBE2C), which is activated by AR in these cells. Selinexor was also tested in tumor graft models of two patient tumors in castrated male mice. The MDA-PCa-133 tumor is an adenocarcinoma derived from a clinical CRPC bone metastasis. Subcutaneous MDA-PCa-133 tumors in castrated male mice express full-length AR and Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) but lack expression of p53. The MDA-PCa-144-13 tumor is a small cell carcinoma derived from a lethal variant of prostate cancer with anaplastic clinical phenotype and does not express AR or PSA but expresses a gain-of-function p53 mutant. Vehicle or Selinexor treatment (10 mg/kg p.o. QoDX3 M/W/F) of MDA-PCa-133 tumors for 34 days resulted in almost complete inhibition of tumor growth with a 30-fold reduction of PSA (p<0.001). Treatment of MDA-PCa-144-13 tumors for 22 days also resulted in significant reduction of tumor volume (>8 fold compared to vehicle only; p<0.0047). Immunohistochemical analysis of MDA-PCa-133 tumors showed that Selinexor induced nuclear accumulation of XPO1 cargos FOXO3a and p27 with concomitant reduction in the proliferation marker KI67.In conclusion, Selinexor demonstrated robust inhibition of CRPC tumor growth and activated multiple tumor suppressors in prostate cancer cells. Selinexor is now being evaluated in Phase 1 clinical studies in patients with advanced hematological and solid tumor cancers, and preliminary results show adequate tolerability with evidence of anti cancer activity.

AKT and pAKT (ser473) were measured in prostate tumor tissues (Normal = 23, Grade I=13, Grade II-24 and Grade III=26) by immunohistochemistry analysis. Phosphorylated AKT is significantly higher in tumors (Grades-I, II and III) as compared to the normal/hyperplastic tissues; however, there no significant differences were seen in AKT expression between normal and tumor tissues. In CRPC cell lines, stable expression of AKT increases proliferation, epithelial mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis in cancer cells. Injection of over expressed AKT, CRPC cells resulted in tumor growth in athymic mice as compared to vector cells. We observed AKT tumors grow rapidly, are larger in size and showed 100% tumorigenecity as compared to the control tumors (40%), which had slow growth, as well as small tumors. Interestingly, subcutaneous injection of AKT/CRPC cells in athymic mice showed hyperplasia in anterior and a ventral lateral lobe of the prostate, which was absent in control tumors. We also found that AKT tumors are highly vascularized than the control tumors; however no micrometastasis were observed in our H &E analysis.Our in vitro studies have revealed that treatment of Withaferin-A, an herbal compound inhibits AKT activation and up regulates Par-4 mediated apoptosis by activating caspase cascades in CRPC cells.

Similarly, oral administration of WA (4mg/kg) significantly inhibited the growth of both control and AKT over expressed tumors (P< 0.001). Currently, we are observing tumor regrowth after stopping the WA treatment and immunohistochemistry analysis to confirm AKT mediated pro-survival signaling and EMT markers in the tumor tissues.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) analyses from the mouse prostate tissues showed MTA1 occupancy of several potential oncogenic miRNA target promoters including miR-22. Retrospective investigation of microRNA microarray experiments revealed downregulation of these candidate miRNAs in LNCaP cells silenced for MTA1 expression (shMTA1). Real time PCR evaluation of shMTA1 cell lines, LNCaP, DU145 and PC3M attested the microarray findings. Using miRNA-mRNA target prediction algorithms, miRanda, miRDB and Targetscan, E-cadherin (CDH1) was identified as a potential target with high context score for miR-22. Interestingly, E-cadherin, which has a pivotal role in preventing Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) of tumor cells was also identified as a MTA1 target gene by ChIP-Seq analysis. Further, qRT-PCR and western blot experiments validated that MTA1 levels had an inverse correlation with E-cadherin expression in these cell lines. Transient transfection of miR-22 mimics diminished E-cadherin levels while this expression was restored by miR-22 sponge inhibitors showing that miR-22 can control E-cadherin expression. Ongoing experiments aim to address the direct targeting of E-cadherin 3UTR by miR-22 using Dual-Glo luciferase reporter assay and the functional consequences of miR-22 promoter regulation by MTA1 utilizing chromatin and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Our studies reveal a novel and previously unrecognized role for MTA1-mediated miR-22 regulation of E-cadherin.']",

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Inflammatory processes have been related to cancer progression and metastasis. Macrophage inflammatory protein 1 or CCL-4 has been reported as a differentially expressed chemokine among patients that showed PCa recurrence after radical prostastectomy. The aim of this study is to determine the role and mechanism of CCL-4 in the progression of PCa using in vitro and in vivo models. PC3 (androgen-independent) and 22RV1 (androgen-dependent) cell lines were treated in vitro with CCL-4 at concentrations of 0.001ng/mL and 0.1ng/mL and subjected to migration (Wound Healing) and invasion (Boyden Chamber) assays. The role of CCL-4 in PCa tumor progression was evaluated using a xenograft model in which the anterior prostate lobes of SCID mice were ortothopically injected with 250,000 22RV1 cells or 500,000 PC3 cells. CCL-4 was administered bi-weekly at concentrations of 0.001ng/mL and 0.1ng/mL with intraperitoneal injections during 4 weeks (22RV1) or 8 weeks (PC3). Tumor volumes were calculated using a caliper and tissue was collected, fixed and processed for gross examination, immunohistochemical, and gene expression analysis. In vitro studies indicated that PC3 cells treated with CCL4 had significantly increased migration when compared to control (P<0.05). Additionaly, in vivo, CCL-4 increased tumor volume when compared with tumors generated in mice treated with vehicle. Tumors developed with CCL-4 showed an increased expression of desmin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (-sma), and phospho histone 3 (pH3). Gene expression analysis showed that CCL-4 modulates the expression of several genes involved in PCa progression including PTEN, -Catenin, and matrix metalloproteinases. Real-Time PCR confirmed increased expression of MMP-11. This study shows that CCL4 alters migration of PC3 cells and 22RV1 cells in vitro. Additionally, CCL4 treatment induces tumor growth in vivo using a SCID mouse orthotopic model. Interestingly tumors treated with CCL4 were associated with increased levels of alpha smooth muscle actin, proliferation as well as increased levels of matrix metalloproteinases. Our results indicate that CCL4 may promote tumor growth and metastasis in vivo by increasing proliferation and altering migration.']",

        "Background":"['Deletion and mutation of tumor suppressor genes (PTEN and p53) may play an important role in the carcinogenesis of prostate cancer (CaP). Constitutive activation of Akt promotes cell proliferation and survival by regulating a number of transcription factors/genes in many cancer cells including CaP. Activation of AKT negatively regulates the pro-apoptotic functions of Fork head transcription factor (FOXO3a) and prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) in CaP cells. In our studies, we found a molecular interplay between FOXO3a and Par-4 in CaP cells and more precisely, how, FOXO3a regulates Par-4 function in CaP cells. Knockin and knockout assays in CaP cells suggest that FOXO3a is upstream of Par-4 and FOXO3a may responsible for the transactivation of Par-4 and its pro-apoptotic function in CaP cells. Further, Immunofluorescence assays suggest during apoptotic stimuli, Par-4 and FOXO3A colocalization in nucleus, which in turn initiates pro-apoptotic signaling and induction of apoptosis. These results were further confirmed by pull down assays, which supports the physical interaction of these two proteins. These findings encouraged us to explore the FOXO3a binding sites in the promoter region of Par-4. We identified four FOXO3a binding sites at -2075 to -2069, -1810 to -1804, -1561 to -1555, and -1340 to -1334 in the promoter region of Par-4 gene. Luciferase reporter constructs of Par-4 promoter (2.1 kb) spanning the FOXO3a binding sites and sequentially deleted constructs were utilized to identify the crucial FOXO3a binding site for the regulation of Par-4. Sequential deletion of FOXO3a binding sites in Par-4 promoter resulted in inhibition of Par-4 function and induction of apoptosis in CaP cells. Further, confirm the role of FOXO3a, we specifically activated Par-4 function by small molecules and simultaneously co-transfect with dominant-negative FOXO3a constructs. As expected dominant negative FOXO3a abrogates Par-4 function in CaP cells, confirming FOXO3a is an upstream of Par-4 signaling and it is required for Par-4 induced apoptosis in CaP cells. We believe, these results decipher the mechanisms associated with FOXO3a induced Par-4 gene activation and apoptosis in CaP cells and activating of FOXO3a may result Par-4 mediated apoptosis in CaP cells.Citation Format', ' Trinath P.

        "Background":"[\"Inhibition of the androgen receptor (AR) results in activation of the PI-3K/mTOR pathway in PTEN deficient prostate cancer cells by reciprocal feedback inhibition (Carver BS, 2011). Enzalutamide or PI-3K/mTor inhibition result in feedback activation and combined inhibition abrogated this effect. We explored AR inhibition in CRPC cell lines with low, intermediate and high AR expression in the context of PI-3K/mTor inhibition to identify biomarkers of response and resistance. We utilized no/low (DU145, PC3), intermediate (LNCaP) and high (22Rv1,VCap) AR expressing prostate cancer (PC) cell lines to evaluate anti-tumor activity with 4 pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (GDC-0980, GDC-0941, LY294002, PF-04691502), enzalutamide and abiraterone as single agents or various in combinations at clinically relevant doses. Cytotoxic activity of enzalutamide was more potent than abiraterone (IC50's was < 1M and > 10M) in LNCaP cells, however, the opposite was seen in DU145 and PC-3 cell lines. High AR expressing cells (22Rv1, VCap) were more sensitive to AR inhibition. PI-3K/mTor SMIs GDC-0980, GDC-0941 or PF-04691502 had IC50's in the range 50-500nM while LY294002 had an IC50 16-24 M except for DU145. This cell line had increased IC50 values comparatively for PI-3K/mTor SMIs GDC-0980, GDC-0941 or PF-04691502 (1.5-3.75 M) and LY29002 (48.5 M). The combination index (CI) isobologram method indicated significant synergism for PI-3K/mTOR SMIs plus enzalutamide or abiraterone in all PC cell lines irrespective of AR status. Combination treatments were associated with increased apoptosis (Annexin-V staining and PARP-cleavage assay) in LNCaP and VCaP > 22Rv1 > DU145 and PC3. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry demonstrated that enzalutamide induces G1 arrest in LNCaP and DU145 cells and G2/M arrest in PC3 cells. PI-3K inhibition induces S arrest in LNCaP and DU145 and G2/M arrest in PC3 cells. The combination of enzalutamide plus PI-3K inhibition enhanced S arrest in LNCaP while in DU145 and PC3, G0/G1 arrest was prominent. PI-3K SMI plus enzalutamide completely inhibited pAkt308/473, pS6 and p4EBP1 in LNCaP cells, pAkt473 in PC3 cells and pS6 and p4EBP1 in 22Rv1 cells. Enzalutamide alone or in combination with PI-3K inhibition also suppressed AR expression in 22Rv1 cells. A 22Rv1 mouse xenograft model is evaluating safety and efficacy of the combination.

        "Background":"['Recently, FDA approved the Enzalutamide as a drug for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Recent studies reported patient populations which are non-responsive to the Enzalutamide therapy. Notably, African-American patients do not fare well for the castration-therapies (Bicalutamide and Enzalutamide). To identify a new therapeutic strategy for such populations, it is very important to understand the mechanism underlying the resistance to Bicalutamide or Enzalutamide. This would involve the use of an appropriate Bicalutamide or Enzalutamide-resistant model. We hypothesized that heterogeneous sub-populations contribute to Enzalutamide and bicalutamide resistance. In this study, we generated cell models representing Bicalutamide- and Enzalutamide-resistant phenotypes of primary prostate tumor of African-Americans. We next isolated subpopulations of Enzalutamide RC-Enz; Eht-Enz) and bicalutamide-resistant (RCbc; Eht-bc) cells. The cell sub-populations were ranked into three major classes viz., (1) highly stem-cell like (expressing several stemness markers BMI1 & CD133), (2) less stem-cell like (express one stemness marker BM1), and (3) non-stem cell like (negative for BMI1 and CD133). Notably, African-American primary CaP cells exhibited higher number of stem cell-like populations than Caucasian primary (22R1) and metastatic cells (PC3). When compared, the African-American Enzalutamide/Bicalutamide-resistant stem cell-like (RC-EnzCD133+/BM1+, RC-bcCD133+/BM1+, Eht-bcCD133+/BM1+ & Eht-EnzCD133+/BM1+) cells exhibited increased rate of proliferation, invasiveness and migration than Enzalutamide-resistant Caucasian stem cell-like cells(LNCaP95EnzCD133+/BM1+). We show that RC-EnzCD133+/BM1+ and RC-bcCD133+/BM1+ cells resistant cells exhibit increased (i) promoter activity of BMI1 gene, (ii) localization of BMI1 protein on PTEN gene, and (iii) physical interaction of BMI1 tumor to E4F1 tumor suppressor protein. This was validated in prostatic tumors of African-Americans. We provide evidence that E4F1 under normal conditions negatively regulates the activity of Androgen receptor (AR)-associated signaling and inhibits growth of cells. We show that BMI1 protein sequesters E4F1 protein and inhibits its check-point type or negative regulation of AR-pathway in Enzalutamide and Bicalutamide-resistant cells. This leads to the growth of stem-cell like tumor cells during the Enzalutamide and Bicalutamide therapies. To conclude, we suggest that (1) E4F1-regulated AR-signaling plays an important role in prostate cancer, particularly in African-Americans, (2) ratio of E4F1 and BM1 expression has the potential as a biopsy biomarker for deciding the disease phenotype and (3) E4F1/BMI1 as a therapeutic target could be exploited to increase the sensitivity to Enzalutamide and Bicalutamide therapies in African-Americans.']",

        "Background":"['The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is essential for tumor growth, proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis. AKT, a central switch in this pathway, is deregulated in a broad range of refractory and primary tumors. Importantly, activation of AKT is one of the major mechanisms by which tumors escape from and become resistant to chemo-, radio- and targeted therapies. We report on preclinical studies of BAY 1001931, a highly selective and potent allosteric AKT1/2 inhibitor. In biochemical assays, BAY 1001931 inhibits AKT1 and AKT2 with similar potency (IC50 = 16 nM) while it displays weak activity against AKT3 (IC50  1 M) and is inactive against 230 other protein/ lipid kinases. Mechanistically, BAY 1001931 blocks AKT signalling by inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT at both Thr308 and Ser473 (IC50 = 3.3 / 5.5 nM) as well as downstream phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (IC50 = 70 nM). The strong inhibition of cellular p-AKT translates to a selective inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in vitro. Cell lines carrying defects in the tumor suppressor PTEN or oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA are most sensitive to BAY 1001931 treatment. Moreover, characterization of BAY 1001931 in a broader breast and prostate cancer cell line panel indicated strongest anti-proliferative efficacy in luminal and HER2 positive breast cancer cell lines and in androgen sensitive prostate cancer cell lines. In vitro combination profiling showed synergistic anti-proliferative effects with anti-hormonal therapeutics in breast and prostate cancer cell lines. When dosed orally in human xenograft tumor models, BAY 1001931 induced strong pharmacodynamic inhibition of AKT phosphorylation that correlated with drug exposure. BAY 1001931 was highly efficacious in multiple xenograft tumor models of different histological types with PIK3CA mutations or PTEN deletions. In tumor models predicted to be dependent on activated AKT signalling such as the KPL4 breast tumor model (PIK3CA H1047R and HER2 overexpression), daily oral treatment with BAY 1001931 induced tumor stasis or regression at well tolerated doses. Most importantly, when combined with anti-hormonal therapies such as tamoxifen in PIK3CA breast cancer xenograft models or bicalutamide or abiraterone acetate in PTEN deleted prostate cancer xenograft models, enhanced anti-tumor efficacy with durable tumor regressions were observed. In conclusion, BAY 1001931 is a highly selective, potent allosteric AKT1/2 inhibitor with strong in vitro and in vivo activity in tumor models with activated AKT signalling and strong synergistic activity in combination with anti-hormonals in breast and prostate cancer.']",

Dose response curves over a dynamic range of nanoPARPi therapy on several cell lines were generated using various customized assays and EC50's were determined. The synergism due to radiosensitization was studied for both therapies using isobolograms. The efficacy of combination PARPi and Pt therapy with nanoparticle platform was determined on GEMM models of endometrial cancers. The functionality of nanoPARPi formulations, reflected by inhibition of PARylation, and cleaved PARP was determined by immunoflourescence assays.Results\", ' NanoPARPi inhibitors were assayed on atleast 8 ovarian cancer cells using various cell based assays. NanoBMN was the most potent PARP inhibitor which is not functionally dependent on BRCA sensitive cells lines whereas nanoOlaparib, seems to be sensitive towards triple negative GEMM derived Ovarian cells (403, 404). PTEN deficient prostate cancer cells were more susceptible to radiosensitization with both nanoPARPi inhibitors (Olaparib, BMN-673), achieving significant long-term cell kill. In all studies NanoBMN-673 showed better efficacy in combination with radiation than NanoOlaparib. In vivo studies with irradiation are underway.Conclusions', ' Robust nanoformulations, NanoOlaparib and nanoBMN-673 have been successfully demonstrated.

        "Background":"['SIRT1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylase, is a member of multigene family of Sirtuins. Traditionally SIRT1 is a known player in enhancing longevity. SIRT1 can target both histone and non-histone proteins to regulate diverse activities including cellular stress resistance, genomic stability, energy metabolism and tumorigenesis. Disruption of SIRT1 in the prostate results in the formation of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions, suggesting a role for SIRT1 in the development of PIN, a precursor lesion for prostate cancer (PCA). Paradoxically, an oncogenic role for SIRT1 was reported as evidenced by development of micro-invasive prostate carcinomas in Pten+/-/Sirt1tg mice. Therefore, SIRT1 may possess both oncogenic and tumor suppressor activities in a context-dependent manner and its role in human cancer remains controversial. To address these paradoxical findings, we examined the role of SIRT1 in prostate pathogenesis using stably silenced for SIRT1 prostate cancer cell lines. Silencing SIRT1 in androgen responsive LNCaP cells resulted in (i) morphological changes indicative of clustering and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT); (ii) significant reduction in their ability to form colonies on soft agar; and (iii) increased autophagic flux. Similarly, silencing SIRT1 resulted in reduced proliferative, colony forming and migratory ability of androgen independent PC-3 cells. Furthermore, notably, genes involved in nuclear receptor (PXR/RXR/FXR/PPAR) and kinase (AMPK, MSP-RON, and RhoA) signaling are significantly altered as evidenced by RNA-seq analysis in these cells. Remarkably, SIRT1 KD cells showed decreased expression of AR and its target genes including PSA, TMPRSS-2, FKBP-5 and PMEPA1. Interestingly, SIRT1 KD reduced PSA-luciferase activity under both normal physiological and androgen deprivation growth conditions with no significant effect on nuclear or cytosolic levels of AR. More importantly, SIRT1 KD cells showed increased sensitivity to growth under androgen deprivation conditions. Intervention with resveratrol (RES, known SIRT1 activator) reduced incidence of HGPIN in prostate specific PTEN KO mouse model with no significant differences in the expression of AR or SIRT1. Consistent with these in vivo observations, SIRT1 had no significant impact on RES-induced growth inhibition. Taken together, these data indicate that SIRT1 could potentially contribute to androgen independence, independent of classical AR signaling. Our study demonstrates that SIRT1 may not play an essential role in mediating RES-induced tumor growth inhibition and that SIRT1 may confer resistance to androgen deprivation therapy and sustains cell survival, suggesting that combination of SIRT1 inhibitors and ADT might be a potential strategy for advanced PCA treatment.

It is known that insufficient nutrient supply combined with high proliferation keeps solid tumors including prostate under hypoxic and metabolic stress. Tumor cells adapt to survive under such conditions through activation of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). AMPK has been reported to be activated in prostate tumors. Therefore targeting AMPK and associated signaling pathways will be a promising approach for prostate cancer management. Accordingly we investigated the role of AMPK in RES-induced growth inhibitory effects using multiple human prostate cancer cell lines and preclinical animal model. These data show that RES treatment (50 M, 24 h) results in activation of SIRT1, significant inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation and cell survival in human prostate cancer cells (RWPE-1, LNCaP, C42B and DU145). The observed molecular changes were associated with induction of apoptosis and autophagy following treatment with RES. Further dietary administration of RES (0.1 and 2%) to 4-5 week old prostate-specific PTEN knockout mice for 11 and 14 weeks showed prevention of HGPIN development. Interestingly intervention for 7 weeks showed prevention of HGPIN development at lower dose but not at high dose. On the other hand, 28-week intervention had no significant effect on the development of HGPIN lesions. Immunohistochemical evaluation showed modulation of AMPK, pS6K and SIRT1 in the prostate. Overall these data provide novel insights into RES-induced prevention of HGPIN development via AMPK/SIRT1/mTORC1 axis. Supported in part by NIH (CA 137518 and 135451 APK).']",

        "Background":"['Purpose of StudyPancreatic cancer is an overwhelming fatal disease with less than 5% of patients surviving beyond 5 years. The most prominent histopathological hallmark of pancreatic cancer is its uniquely dense stromal reaction as evidenced by recent reports that highlight the significant role of stromal fibroblasts on pancreatic tumor cell biology. We used novel mouse models to show that genetic inactivation of Smoothened (Smo) in stromal fibroblasts accelerated Kras-initiated tumorigenesis.Research MethodWe used a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer that relies on constitutive activation of the Kras oncogene in the epithelium. We simultaneously employed cre-loxP technology to conditionally delete Smo exclusively in the fibroblast compartment of the pancreas, thus disrupting the crucial hedgehog paracrine signaling loop between pancreatic tumor cells and fibroblasts.Novel FindingsWe showed that deletion of Smo in stromal fibroblasts accelerated pancreatic tumorigenesis through a mechanism involving destabilization of fibroblast PTEN protein. An unbiased genetic screen revealed the ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzyme UBE2K as a PTEN destabilizer and knockdown of UBE2K blocked the degradation of PTEN protein. Down-regulation of PTEN enhanced TGF- production in stromal fibroblasts, and increased epithelial cell transformation and proliferation through epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR). A selective SMO inhibitor also decreased PTEN in a Kras mouse model as well as in human primary pancreatic cancer associated fibroblasts. Importantly, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patient samples, low PTEN expression correlated with low SMO expression and with reduced overall survival. These results define a pathway that reprograms stromal fibroblasts from a tumor suppressive phenotype to a tumor promoting phenotype, thus highlighting the dual functions of stromal fibroblasts in pancreatic cancer and the molecular consequences of loss of the hedgehog pathway. Thus, a more comprehensive understanding of tumor-stroma interactions is required to assure effective implementation of targeted therapies.Conclusions & ImplicationsRecent pre-clinical reports suggest the pancreatic tumor microenvironment functions predominantly to inhibit tumor growth, challenging the concept of tumor stroma as a therapeutic target. Our results provide molecular insight into how the balance between the opposing activities of tumor stromal fibroblasts is maintained, and potentially identifies targets for restoring stromal tumor suppressive functions. In summary, we demonstrate that ablation of paracrine hedgehog signaling in SMA-positive fibroblasts leads to proteasome-mediated degradation of the PTEN tumor suppressor protein and subsequent activation of oncogenic pathways.']",

Cells undergoing EMT may lack or express low levels of epithelial markers such as EpCAM and cytokeratins (CK) and experience a cadherin switch from epithelial to mesenchymal.

We previously showed that PCa cells expressing the mesenchymal (osteoblast-lineage) marker Cad11 are more likely to home to and colonize bone (Cancer Res 2010). Whether Cad11+ PCa CTC lose CK expression is uncertain. Since Cad11 is an EMT marker relevant to the bone tropism of PCa, we characterized its expression in CTC from patients (pts) with bone metastasis.  Methods', '  Blood from PCa pts (n=86) with different extents of bone involvement was analyzed employing Biocepts microfluidic CTC technology.

To ascertain malignant identity of CK/CD45/DAPI+cells, we used FISH to characterize androgen receptor [AR], Myc and PTEN status.  Results', '  Among 69 pts with detectable CK+ CTC, 39% had at least 1 cell co-expressing Cad11. Very rare CKCad11 CTC displaying different degrees of aneuploidy were also observed, but only in 4 pts.

Here, we describe the cell line screening efforts and xenograft studies that provide rationale for a predictive biomarker strategy both for single agent studies and combinations with chemotherapeutic agents. Methods', ' Cell line screening using GDC-0068 as a single agent and in combination with other agents provided a means of identifying predictive markers across various indications and drug combinations. Single agent screens were performed with GDC-0068 in 9 prostate, 54 breast, and 18 ovarian cell lines. We evaluated combination activity of GDC-0068 with docetaxel, doxorubicin, rapamycin and MEK inhibitor in a panel of 24 cell lines and combination activity of GDC-0068 with 5FU/Cisplatin (Folfox) in a panel of 11 gastric and 15 head and neck cancer cell lines. We also evaluated both single agent activity and combination activity in select xenograft models. Results', ' Single agent screens identified PTEN loss, PIK3CA activating mutations, and RTK activation (HER2 in breast) as key predictive markers in breast, ovarian and prostate cell lines. Similarly, in prostate cancer xenograft models, the highest tumor growth inhibition was seen in models with PI3K pathway activation, e.g. via PTEN loss. In the GDC-0068 combination studies, MEK inhibitors provided the most significant synergy across different targeted and chemotherapy agents tested (rapamycin, docetaxel, doxurubicin). In combination with 5FU/Cisplatin, we observed additive effects in gastric and head and neck cell lines and this response was best observed in cell lines with pathway activation', ' PTEN loss, PI3K mutations or amplifications, and/or high pAKT.

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the leading causes of death in men across the world. Despite the initial success of androgen ablation therapy, resistance to anti-androgen therapy manifests by progression to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is the end stage that accounts for the majority of PCa patient deaths. Docetaxel (DTX) is an approved drug for the treatment of CRPC. However, development of DTX resistance and toxicity are the major limitations in the use of DTX in the treatment of CRPC. Now we investigated to determine whether these limitations may be overcome by combining DTX with plumbagin (PL). PL is a quinoid constituent isolated from the root of Plumbago zeylanica L. The roots of Plumbago zeylanica L. have been used in Indian medicine for more than 2500 years for treatment of various ailments. We were the first to report that PL inhibits the growth and PCa metastasis. Now we present that PL', ' 1) sensitizes CRPC cells to DTX and thus reduces its effective therapeutic dose to prevent DTX resistance and toxicity, and 2) inhibits the viability and growth of DTX resistant cells (22Rv1R). In combination therapeutic experiments, the effects of different concentrations of PL (0, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 M) alone or in combination with DTX (0.25 nM and 0.5 nM) on colony formation in 22Rv1 and C4-2 prostate cancer cells, was determined. Combined treatment of PL and DTX has more than additive inhibitory effects on colony formation. This synergism of PL and DTX on colony formation can be explained on the basis of unique mechanism of action of PL and DTX. PL-induced inhibition of PCa growth and metastasis involves inhibition of the expression of multiple targets including PKC, which correlates with the aggressiveness of PCa and plays roles in both androgen independent androgen receptor (AR) activation and promotion of PCa cell survival. DTX targets microtubules, impairs AR signaling, and inhibits cell division. To determine the effects of PL on DTX resistant PCa cells, we established DTX-resistant 22Rv1 cell line (22Rv1R). 22Rv1R overexpresses multidrug resistant protein 1 (MDR1, also known as P-glycoprotein). MDR1 is overexpressed in many tumors and thus causing intrinsic drug resistant. Transcription factor NF-KB, which is linked to cell proliferation and survival, is also activated in 22Rv1R. PL inhibited the colony forming efficiency of 22Rv1R cells which accompanied inhibition of MDR1 expression and NF-KB activation. In summary, the results presented here and the ones reported by us previously with preclinical mouse models (TRAMP and PTEN knockout mice) of PCa indicate that PL has the potential to prevent as well as treat PCa. PL is a potential natural agent worthy of investigation for prevention and treatment of human PCa. (Support', ' NIH grant CA102431).']",

        "Background":"['Introduction and Objective', ' Androgen receptor (AR) plays critical roles in prostate growth and differentiation and prostate tumorigenesis. Our recent investigations have discovered a novel mechanism of AR degradation in CaP cells involving PMEPA1 and NEDD4-1 which is independent of MDM2. Previously we have shown that PMEPA1 is a highly androgen-inducible gene in CaP cells that recruits the NEDD4-1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, to degrade AR. In an independent study NEDD4-1 has been identified as an E3 ligase controlling the levels of PTEN. We hypothesize that decreased or loss of PMPEA1 expression that is frequently observed in human prostate tumor cells may lead to enhanced AR functions. Elevated AR levels may increase NEDD4-1 and in turn destabilize PTEN in prostate cancer cells. Here, we further investigate the co-operation between PMEPA1 and NEDD4-1 to alter AR and PTEN protein levels. Methods', ' PMEPA1 and NEDD4-1 were ectopically expressed in androgen responsive LNCaP and VCaP cells by pCMV-XL4 and pcDNA3.1 vectors, respectively. AR, PMEPA1, NEDD4-1, MDM2 and PTEN were silenced by using specific siRNAs. Cell growth was monitored in response modulation of PMEPA1, NEDD4 and AR. Protein levels of AR, PMEPA1, NEDD4-1, PTEN and PSA were assessed by immunoblot assays. Results', ' Decreases in AR protein levels, inhibited AR signaling and cell growth in response to heterologous expression of NEDD4-1. Consistent with this observation, inhibition of NEDD4-1 by siRNA resulted in elevated AR protein levels, AR signaling and increased cell growth. Reduced cell growth by AR knock-down or by heterologous expression of NEDD4-, were rescued by the knockdown of PMEPA1. It was also shown that AR up-regulates the expression of NEDD4-1 in hormone responsive CaP cells. In VCaP cells, overexpression of NEDD4-1 resulted in decreased PTEN protein levels. Remarkably, PMEPA1 knockdown resulted in elevated AR and NEDD4-1 levels and the downregulation of PTEN protein. Conclusions', ' NEDD4-1 mediated AR degradation in hormone responsive CaP cells requires PMEPA1. The frequently observed decreased expression of PMEPA1 results in elevated AR protein levels and may facilitate NEDD4-1 mediated degradation of PTEN in CaP. Our findings revealed a complex interplay of the AR, PMEPA1, NEDD4 and PTEN underscoring the impact of the loss of PMEPA1 to increased AR and decreased PTEN, both proteins critical in prostate tumorigenesis.

It is presently unknown how ERG and ETV1 function leads to prostate tumorigenesis, and whether the factors play similar roles in this process. To address this, we focused on identification of their direct chromosomal targets relevant for prostate cancer initiation and progression. We also generated Tmprss2-ERG and Tmprss2-ETV1 knockin mouse models to interrogate the in vivo roles of these two most prevalent gene fusions. To investigate the transcriptional program regulated by ERG and ETV1, we performed siRNA silencing experiments in prostate cancer cells and overexpression studies in normal prostate immortalized cells. With the aid of a biotin-tagging approach, we also identified chromatin sites occupied by ERG and ETV1 in prostate cells. Cross-referencing ETV1 and ERG gene promoter binding to global expression profiling data permitted characterization of ERG and ETV1 -regulated programs in prostate cells. These combined transcriptional studies revealed that a common transcriptional network regulated by ERG and ETV1 but in an opposite fashion. Indeed, ETV1 enhanced the androgen receptor (AR) pathway, favoring tumor growth, while ERG showed a negative effect over the same pathway. Consistent with this, in the mouse models, ERG and ETV1 also exhibited differential regulation of common pathways', ' exogenous expression of ERG from the endogenous Tmprss2 promoter was much lower than that of ETV1, possibly due to a negative regulation of AR target genes (including Tmprss2) by ERG; however, transgenic overexpression of a mutated version of AR was able to break this negative regulation and significantly upregulated Tmprss2-ERG expression in vivo. In contrast, Tmprss2-ETV1 expression alone was able to upregulate expression of AR targets in vivo. Moreover, although ectopic expression of either ERG or ETV1 from the endogenous Tmprss2 locus alone in mouse prostate was insufficient to initiate prostate tumorigenesis in vivo, Tmprss2-ETV1 cooperated with Pten loss to enhance the prostate cancer phenotype, whereas Tmprss2-ERG failed to significantly affect the prostate phenotype induced by Pten-loss. Finally, analysis of patient data supported a differential outcome based on the presence of ERG or ETV1 fusions. In summary, we conclude that ERG and ETV1 play different roles in prostate tumorigenesis, and accordingly prostate cancers with ERG or ETV1 fusions should be considered different molecular subtypes. These findings have important implications for the development of targeted therapy for ERG- and ETV1-associated prostate cancers.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction and Objectives', ' Bicalutamide induces a rapid and sustained hypoxia in growing LNCaP prostatic tumors. This treatment-induced hypoxia (>14 days) increases synthesis of the CXC-chemokine Interleukin-8(CXCL8) co-incident with increasing oxygen tension and the restoration of tumor vascularisation1. Consequently, our current hypothesis is that hypoxia induced CXCL8 signalling underpins resistance to bicalutamide-treated tumors and facilitates the adoption of more aggressive cancer cells.Results', \" Culturing of LNCaP (PTEN null) and 22Rv1 (PTEN wt) cells under hypoxic conditions (mimicking a bicalutamide-treated tumor microenvironment) increased transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR), Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF-1) and NF-kB, inducing expression of downstream target genes associated with survival, metabolic adaptation and angiogenesis. The magnitude and duration of these responses was greater in PTEN-null LNCaP cells. Experiments were conducted to determine how bicalutamide-mediated inhibition of AR signalling would affect hypoxia-induced potentiation of AR, HIF and NF-kB transcription. Bicalutamide or an AR-targeted siRNA failed to reduce expression of pro-angiogenic, pro-survival and metabolism-associated genes. However, concurrent knockdown of both HIF-1 and NF-kB activity using gene-targeted siRNA's repressed expression of these hypoxia-induced disease-progressing genes. Amongst the genes up-regulated in hypoxic and PTEN-deficient LNCaP cells was expression of CXCL8 and its receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, which we have previously shown to be regulated by HIF-1 and NF-kB activity. Potentiation of CXCL8 signalling under hypoxia was found to sustain AR, HIF and NF-kB transcription. Combination of bicalutamide with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib attenuated hypoxia-induced AR expression and transcriptional activity and decreased HIF-1 activity but failed to reduce NF-kB activity. In contrast, only direct inhibition of CXCL8 signalling was shown to repress activity of AR, HIF-1 and NF-kB in hypoxic LNCaP cells and increased LNCaP cells sensitivity to bicalutamide.Conclusion\", ' Our data suggests that targeting CXCL8 signalling may therefore be a relevant strategy to enhance tumor response to anti-androgen therapies. Inhibiting signalling of this chemokine attenuates key transcriptional approaches induced in the hypoxic microenvironment of bicalutamide-treated tumors. Moreover, inhibition of CXCL8 signalling may prevent the re-vascularization previously observed in hypoxic LNCaP tumors.']",

PARP inhibitors (PARPi) such as Olaparib and Talazoparib exploit the concept of synthetic lethality by selectively targeting cancer cells with defective DNA repair pathways. These drugs are currently only available in oral form which results in limited bioavailability, poor tumor accumulation, and systemic toxicity. Here we report the development of novel nanoformulations of Olaparib and Talazoparib to allow intravenous or intraperitoneal delivery, providing greater bioavailability and tumor accumulation, while limiting systemic toxicities.Methods', ' Nanoparticle formulations of Olaparib and Talazoparib were synthesized and tested in vitro and in vivo. Short-and long-term dose response with a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines were conducted. These cell lines include KURAMOCHI, SKOV3, OVSAHO, JHOS2, PA1, COV318, 403 and 404, derived from BRCA2-/-, PTEN-/-, TP53mut mice, and 4306 and 4412, developed from conditional LSL-K-rasG12D/+, PTENloxP/loxP mice. Radiosensitization with NanoOlaparib was tested in the radiation resistant prostate cancer cell line FK01, derived from Ptenpc-/-;Trp53pc-/- mice. In vivo, NanoOlaparib was tested in an IP spread model using 404 cells. Animals were treated IP with NanoOlaparib alone, and in combination with cisplatin. Radiosensitization with NanoOlaparib in vivo was tested in a xenograft model using FK01 cells to mimic castration resistant prostate cancer. Animals were treated biweekly with NanoOlaparib before and after radiation treatment.Results', ' The murine cell lines 403 and 404 were highly sensitive to this treatment due to the mutations in BRCA2, PTEN, and TP53. 4412 and 4306 showed comparable sensitivity, suggesting that a PTEN deletion confers similar sensitivity to PARP inhibitors as a BRCA2 deletion. PA1 demonstrated high sensitivity to NanoOlaparib which may be attributed to genetic instability. NanoTalazoparib is more potent than NanoOlaparib, resulting in a similar relationship in cell line sensitivity with overall lower IC50s. Strong synergistic radiosensitization was observed in FK01 cells with NanoOlaparib.Bioluminescence imaging illustrated that NanoOlaparib administered IP daily resulted in a greater inhibition of tumor growth than those treated with oral Olaparib daily. The FK01 xenografts are highly radioresistant with little difference between untreated and radiation only animals. NanoOlaparib delays tumor growth, while the combination of radiation and NanoOlaparib clearly shrinks tumors.Conclusions', ' Robust nanoparticle formulations of NanoTalazoparib and NanoOlaparib have been successfully developed for in vitro and in vivo studies. These results show that NanoOlaparib and NanoTalazoparib amplify the therapeutic efficacy of PARP inhibition and imply a very promising role for the nanoformulation in ovarian and prostate cancers.']",

Highly aggressive PCa most often does not come to surgery preventing access to frozen sample for high-throughput studies. The purpose of this study is to determine the spectrum of mutations in a subgroup of highly aggressive PCa and to evaluate for targetable molecular alterations using a novel mutation analysis platform from archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. Methods', ' 21 PCa (of which 9 were Gleason 5, 8 metastatic), 18 Neuroendocrine PCa (NEPC), and 18 benign FFPE prostate samples from 35 unique cases were evaluated and 77 high-density foci were selected for DNA extraction and sequencing library construction. Hybridization-based capture of 3230 exons and 37 intronic intervals of 189 cancer-related genes was performed, followed by deep, massively-parallel sequencing. Sequence data were analyzed for single nucleotide variants (sub), small insertions and deletions (indels), significant copy number changes, and selected re-arrangements/fusion genes. Results', ' 5/8 biopsies and 62/65 (overall 93%) of prostate or metastatic foci yielded sufficient DNA (50 ng) for analysis from 40 of FFPE tissue. Average uniquely-mapping sequence coverage was 885x. 133 mutations were identified in 30 genes with 58/67 samples containing at least one mutation. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion was present in 31% of cases. Recurrent high confidence cancer alterations included', ' gain of MYC (9%), gain or sub/indel of AR (43%), deletion or sub/indel of PTEN (23%), RB1 (20%), BRCA2 (11%), and sub/indel of TP53 (40%), CTNNB1 (11%), PIK3CA (6%), ATM (6%).

There was high concordance between NEPC and PCa foci in mixed tumors, as well as between primary tumor and metastases. Conclusions', ' This study demonstrates feasibility of in-depth DNA analysis using FFPE tissue, and even biopsy material. The spectrum of driver mutations observed highlights potential value of comprehensive genomic profiling for targeted therapy selection in clinical care. These analyses have laid the foundation for ongoing comparison with indolent PCa, and have identified potential new drug targets (e.g., PARP inhibitors for ATM and BRCA2 mutations), with a goal towards better defining biomarkers that distinguish aggressive and indolent PCa and designing more effective treatment approaches for patients with lethal PCa.']",

        "Background":"['Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a robust technique when used with appropriate interpretative guidelines, and the assay can yield consistent results that provide diagnostically and prognostically useful information to help guide patient therapy. The establishment of quality control standards in clinical laboratories using routine FISH analysis of formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections in different tumor types for fusion and break-apart strategies and gene amplifications have been developed for both analysis and reporting, but at the present time there are no comprehensive guidelines for the analysis of genomic deletions using FFPE sections. The use of FISH on archival FFPE samples is technically demanding and becomes more challenging when applied to paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays. The evaluation of FISH signals in interphase nuclei of FFPE sections is affected by truncation and overlapping of the nuclei due to varying cell density, tissue architecture differences and histological forms. In this study we report a generalizable four-color deletion FISH approach to assist interpretation problems arising when evaluating FISH signals. The guidelines will help address interpretative dilemmas associated with overlapping and truncated nuclei in FFPE prostate cancer sections. The four-color FISH approach was developed using the PTEN tumor suppressor gene deletion model in prostate cancer. The PTEN assay was based on a robust bioinformatics analysis of 311 published human genome array datasets and comprises a centromeric chromosome enumeration probe, a specific PTEN gene probe, and control flanking probes either side of the target probe. The sensitivity and specificity parameters of the four-color PTEN probe set were further characterized using a large number of well-characterized tumors and stringent scoring criteria. The incorporation of flanking control probes allowed the analysts to determine if the chromosomal region was subject to truncation loss. A minimum threshold for apparent deletion frequency was set to address the heterogeneous and homogeneous nature of tumor histology. In addition the approach facilitated analysis of genotypic heterogeneity and varying clonality within different foci of tumor in the prostate. Overall the approach provided robust and highly reproducible results that minimized inter- and intra-assay variability. The four-color FISH deletion assay reduced the frequency of misinterpretation and improved both the quality and throughput of FISH analyses using clinical samples. Moreover the use of established controls and conservative cut-offs for assigning deletions will facilitate more coherent approach to developing reporting standards for deletion assays as more tumor suppressor genes of clinical importance are discovered by next generation sequencing methods.']",

The evidence for increased protein levels of B7-H1/PD-L1 comes largely from immunohistochemistry analysis of surgical and biopsy specimens. While several studies attempt to correlate B7-H1/PD-L1 expression with poor prognosis, there are studies that conclude no correlation based on technical difficulties associated with detecting B7-H1/PD-L1 protein expression on the cell surface. We were able to quantifiably measure soluble B7-H1/PD-L1 in conditioned medium from tumor cell cultures using two new immunoassays, a Quantikine® ELISA and a Simple Plex™ Assay. We show that breast, prostate, glioma, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cells express various levels of B7-H1/PD-L1 which correlate to their PTEN or proliferation status. This is in agreement with previous findings showing that increases in B7-H1/PD-L1 expression levels are frequently coincident with loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor or increased activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K) pathway. The androgen-responsive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line does not exhibit measurable B7-H1/PD-L1 in any instance, while the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line PC-3 expresses measurable B7-H1/PD-L1 that is further inducible with PMA treatment. In all cell lines included in our study, incubation with PMA increases the level of B7-H1/PD-L1 released into the culture media, while pretreatment with the PI 3-K inhibitor, LY294002, abrogates this increase. Importantly, the Simple Plex platform is able to quantify very low levels of B7-H1/PD-L1 that are below detection by ELISA.

ERG overexpression abrogates cell differentiation, promotes cell invasion and epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and additional Pten loss or AKT up-regulation enhances the transformation into well-differentiated prostate adenocarcinoma. Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is a calciumdependent phospholipidbinding protein that regulates cell adhesion, cellular junction formation, actin remodeling and genesis of cell polarity. Evidence from a variety of malignancies suggests that ANXA2 is vital for promoting adhesion, migration and metastasis in cancer cells. In CaP, ANXA2 expression is lost or reduced, however, is increased in high grade tumors. Microarray gene expression studies have shown an inverse correlated ERG and ANXA2 expression. We examined the cancer associated functions of ERG and ANXA2 such as cell invasion, cell migration and cell polarity in CaP cell lines.Methods', ' ANXA2 and ERG cellular localization were monitored using fluorescence microscopy. The prostate specific transcriptional initiation site of ANXA2 was defined by 5RACE. Ch-IP Assay was used to show the recruitment of ERG to the ANXA2 promoter. Cases consisting of well differentiated and poorly differentiated CaP with and without TMPRSS2-ERG fusion were stained with ANXA2 and ERG antibodies to determine correlation in expression.Results', ' The inverse correlation between ERG and ANXA2 protein expression was confirmed by ERG knockdown experiments in VCaP cells. ERG overexpression in prostate adenocarcinoma is correlated with the loss ANXA2 expression in 90% of cases examined. A subset of ERG positive tumors exhibit small clusters of cells with clonal expression of ANXA2. We evaluated the patterns of ERG-ANXA2 expression against available clinical-pathological features.Conclusions', ' Our findings suggest that the expression of ANXA2 and its function in establishing cell polarity and cellular junctions may be disrupted by ERG overexpression through the transcriptional repression of ANXA2. We hypothesize that the reemergence of ANXA2 expression in advanced tumors reflects the accumulation of genetic hits that resulted in a more aggressive tumor with higher metastatic capacity. An IHC based assay with combined ERG and ANXA2 antibody cocktail could enhance the pathological evaluation of prostate tumors discern the re-expression of ANXA2 in ERG positive tumors and improve the prognosis and treatment of CaPs.This research was in part supported by the National Cancer Institute R01CA162383 grant to S.

        "Background":"['The majority of kinase inhibitors in cancer clinical trials have been evaluated in the context of cell autonomous induction of apoptosis. However, apoptosis can result in protumorigenic immunosuppression, which limits the durability of an anti-tumor response. Recent clinical trial data shows striking clinical and radiographic responses with kinase inhibitor cabozantinib (XL-184) in metastatic solid tumors, particularly in the context of bone metastases. However, the mechanism responsible for this robust antitumor response remain unknown. Here we show that cabozantinib eradicates poorly differentiated invasive cancer that develop in the context of prostate-specific PTEN and p53 loss, respectively, within 48 hours of cabozantinib treatment. This rapid tumor clearance was temporally associated with infiltration of mature polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the tumor bed. These anti-tumor effects of cabozantinib appear to be MET-independent, since the MET inhibitor PF-04217903 did not phenocopy the effects of cabozantinib in the prostate-specific PTEN/p53 deficient mouse model in vivo. Unexpectedly, in vitro treatment of PTEN/p53 deficient cell lines derived from murine tumors showed insignificant apoptosis, but robust extracellular release of HMGB1, a neutrophil chemoattractant, and marker of immunogenic cell death. To elucidate the relevance of an immunogenic anti-tumor mechanism in vivo, we performed RNA-seq profiling and quantitative RT-PCR analysis, which showed an acute increase in anti-tumor inflammatory cytokine gene expression signature and neutrophil activation/chemotaxis markers following acute cabozantinib treatment. Critically, blockade of neutrophil chemotaxis/trafficking with dexamethasone or depletion with anti-Ly6G antibody, reversed the effects of cabozantinib towards eradication of advanced PTEN/p53 deficient tumors. Finally, cytokine array profiling of supernatant from bone marrow metastases from castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients showed increased neutrophil markers and decreased IL-6 levels within the bone microenvironment following 6 weeks of cabozantinib treatment., thus polarizing the neutrophils into N1 effector cells. Collectively, these results shed light on a novel anti-tumor immunogenic mechanism for cabozantinib within the tumor microenvironment of PTEN/p53 deficient tumors, which unleashes a profound innate anti-tumor immune response. These findings suggest the possibility of combination therapies of cabozantinib with T-cell checkpoint blockade or vaccine-based approaches, to augment immunologic responses in advanced cancers.']",

Four are neuroendocine, 12 are castration resistant (CR) sublines and 7 are abiraterone or MDV-3100 resistant sublines. Comprehensive characterization studies have been done on 24 lines. All lines histologically resemble the originating clinical specimen. Unsupervised gene expression array clustering analyses revealed (a) association between the xenograft and the originating clinical specimen, (b) pairing of androgen-sensitive lines with their CR sublines, (c) a distinction between adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine phenotypes and (d) insignificant drift over a 2-5 year period of serial passage.

Cix, a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody, specifically targets IGF-IR with high affinity and antagonizes IGF-I and IGF-II ligand binding and signaling. It inhibits the IGF-IR pathway by effecting internalization and degradation of IGF-IR. In vitro and in vivo, cix inhibits proliferation of a variety of human tumor cell lines (Cancer Res. 2003;63', '8912; Clin Cancer Res. 2005;11', '3065). Temsirolimus inhibits mTOR, (Oncogene 2007;26', '1932) and has been shown to inhibit growth of histologically diverse tumor cells. Since activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTor signaling is associated with negative feedback on IGF-1R and other upstream pathways, it is hypothesized that relief of this negative feedback with a rapamycin-analog may paradoxically activate IGF/AKT signaling, thus attenuating antitumor effects. Inhibition using an IGF-1R antibody in addition to mTOR inhibition may restore antitumor activity (Cancer Res 2006;66', '1500). Prostate cancer, despite a high frequency of PTEN loss (>50%) and AKT/mTOR signaling, is relatively insensitive to single agent mTOR inhibition and is an ideal setting to test an IGF-1R antibody in combination with mTOR inhibition.

It has been hypothesized that CTCs could be used as a liquid biopsy to obtain repeat molecular characterizations and provide dynamic insight into the biology of an underlying cancer. However, due to the low abundance of CTCs and technical limitations in the single-cell sequencing, it had been very difficult to characterize CTCs on a whole genome scale. The surrogacy of CTCs for conventional tumor tissues has never been demonstrated beyond targeted genomic alterations such as shared ETS fusions in prostate cancer (PC), EGFR mutations in lung cancer and BRAF mutations in melanoma. With recent technical advances in single-cell sequencing and single-CTC isolation technologies, we present the first study using whole genome sequencing (WGS) of isolated serially-collected single CTCs in a PC patient.Method\", ' By combining NanoVelcro CTC Chip with laser microdissection, we developed a robust platform for single-CTC isolation. Subsequent WGS was performed after the multiple displacement amplification of our single-CTC DNA. From a PC patient, we performed WGS on four of his CTCs on two different time point, his primary prostatectomy tissue and liver metastasis along with WBC and normal adjacent tissue from the prostatectomy as controls. Copy number variations, single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and structural variations (SVs), including rearrangements were identified for comparison.Results', ' We successfully performed WGS on isolated single CTCs, achieving 30X depth and >95% coverage. SNV analysis reveals that 33.5% (289/863) of founder somatic mutations (defined as mutations shared between primary and metastatic tumors) can be found in CTCs. Looking into the mutational landscape of CTCs, 48% of the CTC mutations can be traced back to either primary or metastatic tumor. Per SV analysis, we found and validated an intrachromosomal rearrangement in chr3 and an interchromosomal rearrangement between chr13 and chr15. These rearrangements are shared between both tumor tissues and most of the CTCs, but not discovered in WBC and normal adjacent tissue. At the same time, highly heterogeneous short SVs were discovered in PTEN, RB1 and BRCA2 in all tumor samples, suggesting a continuous evolution of SVs in these important tumor suppressor genes.Conclusion', ' Based on our capability to obtain high-quality WGS from single-CTCs, we validate the genomic surrogacy of CTCs by the detection of shared SNVs and rearrangements between CTCs and tumor tissues. The heterogeneous mutational landscapes of SNVs and SVs are also discovered in single-CTCs, indicating the value of our single-CTC WGS approach. We envision our single-CTC WGS approach will be utilized for studying tumor heterogeneity and the biological evolution of cancer during disease progression, even during anticancer therapy.']",

We have previously reported that ChK decreases Akt activation and modulates key downstream Akt/mTOR pathway effectors in tumorigenic cells. The down-regulation of Akt activation by ChK is independent of class I PI3K enzyme inhibition or the upstream mediators PDK1, PTEN, and mTORC2. The purpose of these studies was to investigate the effect of ChK on the proliferation and migration of prostate carcinoma cells of various metastatic potential and PTEN status. The activation of Akt was monitored to assess the ability of ChK to inhibit Akt in prostate carcinoma cells. In these studies, MTT assays were used to measure the number of viable PC3, DU145, and LNCaP cells treated with ChK. Scratch wound and transwell migration assays were utilized to examine the effect of ChK on cell migration. To assess Akt activation, western blot analysis was performed to measure changes in Akt phosphorylation at the ser473 and thr308 sites after cells were treated with ChK or vehicle. ChK was found to inhibit the number of viable PC3, DU145, and LNCaP cells with IC50 values in the 3-5M range. ChK inhibited migration of PC3 cells into the wound space at 1M by approximately 60% after 72 hours as compared to vehicle treated controls. ChK inhibited transwell migration of PC3 cells by greater than 90% compared to controls after 5 hours. Additionally, ChK treatment lowered Akt phosphorylation at key activation sites. In summary, ChK inhibits the proliferation, migration, and Akt activation of prostate carcinoma cells in vitro.

Telomeres are maintained by the enzyme telomerase, which is made up of a reverse transcriptase encoded by TERT, and an RNA template encoded by TERC. The telomere structure itself is composed of proteins encoded by ACD, ACYP2, BICD1, DKC1, DCLRE1B, MPHOSPH6, NAF1, NOLA1, NOLA2, NOLA3, OBFC1, PIK3C3, POT1, RTEL1, TEP1, TERF1, TERF2, TERF21P, TINF2, TNKS/PINX1, TPP1 and ZNF208.

We systematically characterized the patterns of association between variants in these 25 telomere structure and maintenance genes and risk across five cancer types in the Genetic Association and Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON) consortium.We performed a subset-based meta-analysis (ASSET) of 209,367 directly measured and imputed SNPs, one megabase up- and downstream of these genes, across genome-wide association studies of colorectal (5,100 cases, 4,831 controls), lung (12,160 cases, 16,838 controls), breast (15,748 cases, 18,084 controls), ovarian (4,369 cases, 9,123 controls) and prostate (14,160 cases, 12,724 controls) cancers. Correlations (r2) between SNPs were examined in Haploview using the 1000 Genomes Project CEU population.A total of 87 TERT, 123 TERC and 26 DCLRE1B SNPs were associated with cancer risk at gene-level Bonferroni-corrected p-values of 4.2-7.8106.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Patients presenting with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have the poorest prognosis of all breast cancer (BC) subtypes and there are limited treatment options, with no efficacious targeted therapies. Therefore, improved approaches to treatment of these cancers are an unmet need. Several molecular targets including', ' epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), and Src family tyrosine kinases are under clinical investigation for the treatment of this disease (De et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2013). Src family tyrosine kinases play a critical role in signal transduction downstream of growth factor receptors and integrin family members. Preclinical studies have established a role for Src family kinases in proliferation, angiogenesis and invasion in prostate cancer model (Varcaris et al., 2014). Dasatinib is an rally-active ATP-competitive small molecule kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits Abl kinase, Src family kinases and other kinases (Lombardo et al., 2004), and has shown its anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effectiveness against TNBC in both preclinical and clinical studies (Finn et al., 2011). Recently, PARP inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy have shown promising results in TNBC in clinical and preclinical studies (Tutt et al., 2010; De et al., 2014). We hypothesize that the inhibitor of Src family of kinases (dasatinib) in combination with PARP inhibitor (ABT888) plus standard cytotoxic agent (carboplatin) will attenuate the growth of TNBC cell lines. Methodology', ' BT-20 (PIK3CA mutated, H1047R), HCC70 (PTEN null), HCC1937 (PTEN null), MDA-MB-231 (KRAS/BRAF mutated), MDA-MB-468 (PTEN null) and SUM149PT (BRCA1 mutated, PTEN null) cells were used for this study. Growth inhibition, survival/proliferation, colony formation and apoptosis were examined using MTT assay, 2D proliferative/growth assay, 3D-ON-TOP assays, and annexinV staining respectively. Results', ' Our data showed that 1) High anti-proliferative activities were observed following the treatment of dasatinib along with ABT888 plus carboplatin in both 2D proliferation assay and 3D-ON TOP colony formation assay. 2) In the same line, dasatinib in combination with ABT888 plus carboplatin inducing early stage apoptosis was seen by Annexin V staining in all tested cell lines. 3) Our MTT data showed that anti-proliferative activity of dasatinib as a single agent is highly variable in different genetic background of TNBC cell lines. Conclusion', ' Our data suggest that the combination of Src inhibitor may enhance the antitumor activity of PARP inhibitor plus standard cytotoxic agent in TNBC models. Mechanistic studies are ongoing, the results of which will be presented in the meeting.']",

Increased levels of cholesterol esters (CE) have been reported in breast cancer, leukemia, glioma and prostate cancer, but not exploited in detail in ovarian and endometrial cancers. Inside cells, excess free cholesterol is esterified by acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) and stored as cholesteryl ester (CE) in lipid droplets (LDs). Cholesteryl ester accumulation may be a consequence of loss of tumor suppressor PTEN and subsequent activation of PI3K/AKT pathway as observed in pancreatic cancer. In the present study, we focused on the role of ACAT and cholesterol esters in altered cholesterol metabolism in ovarian/endometrial cancer cell lines.']",

        "Background":"[\"AZD8186 inhibits Pi3K isoforms Pi3K and , with selectivity over Pi3K and . In solid tumours Pi3K drives tumour growth when the tumour suppressor PTEN is deleted, mutated or downregulated. It also mediates signals from specific GPCR receptors. Pi3K signals downstream of the B-cell receptor, creating potential for targeted treatment of haematological malignancies such as CLL, MCL & indolent NHL and possibly DLBCL. AZD8186 is differentiated from many other agents that target Pi3K family members as it isn't likely to impact glucose control. AZD8186 has single agent activity in a range of models, although maximal benefit is anticipated when used in combination. Loss of PTEN mediated control, and hence dependency on PI3K occurs in many solid tumour types, and is altered in up to 40-50% of tumours in some individual disease states. Commonly PTEN dysregulation is associated with other activation of other signaling pathways. To explore this we have combined AZD8186 with a number of different agents. In HCC70 (triple negative breast cancer) and PC3 (prostate cancer) xenografts combination of AZD8186 (25mg/kg bid) with single dose docetaxel (15mg/kg) gives >90% tumour growth inhibition (TGI), compared to 40-50% with docetaxel alone. AZD8186 also combines with other targeted agents. In HCC70, AZD8186 (25mg/kg bid) combined with selumetinib (10mg/kg) gave 94% TGI compared to 66%, and 47% with each single agent. In combination with AZD2014 (mTORC1/2 inhibitor) (15mg/kg qd) in HCC70 xenografts AZD8186 (25mg/kg bid) gave regressions (-23%) compared to TGI of 87% and 77% for each agent alone. In 786-0 (renal cancer) xenografts AZD8186 (12.5mg/kg bid) and AZD2014 (15mg/kg qd) gave regression of -82% compared to TGI of 33% and regression of -39% with each agent alone. This data establishes the potential for AZD8186 to be used in combination with a number of different agents including the ability to customise dose and schedule to optimise both tolerability as well as anti-tumour effects. Further exploration of the combination opportunities for AZD8186 with other molecular targeted agents would inform on the potential for inhibitors of Pi3K and  to give benefit in different tumour types.\"]",

Methods\", ' We performed laser capture microdissection to isolate pure foci of residual tumor cells from 19 patients who underwent RP following 24 weeks of leuprolide plus AA. We also isolated 19 foci of matched benign glands as germline controls. In 15 of the 19 cases, we dissected 2 spatially-distinct foci of residual tumor. We then performed whole exome sequencing to assess somatic mutations and copy number variations (CNVs). Results', ' A diversity of genomic resistance mechanisms were observed. Resistance to AA as predicted by mutation of the ligand binding domain of AR was observed in only one case. In contrast, the majority residual tumor foci harbored CNVs coinciding with gain of oncogenes or loss of tumor suppressor genes. Importantly, only a limited number of alterations were shared between foci from the same case, as most mutations were unshared. Shared CNVs frequently included arm-level single copy losses of 10q (PTEN), 13q (BRCA2), 5q (CHD1), 17p (TP53), 16q (ZFHX3) and 8p (NKX3-1), and gain of 8q (MYC). Mutations not shared by foci in the same case included further biallelic inactivation of PTEN, BRCA2 and TP53, as well as point mutations and single copy losses of BRCA1 and RB1. Distinct, focal gains included AR, PIK3CA and BRAF, and mutations also accumulated in KMT2B, KMT2C and KMT2D. Conclusions', ' By sampling multiple foci of residual tumor, we identified mutations that likely emerged by subclonal selection by ADT, which cooperated with the shared, clonal mutations that contributed to de novo development of the index lesion.

The objective of our studies was to establish and characterize multiple novel PCa xenografts to enable the use of multiple models in preclinical studies leading to the generation of clinically and biologically relevant data. We have established 28 novel PCa xenografts and our characterization studies show that these models portray the characteristics and reflect the diversity of the disease observed in patients. We have established xenografts from primary PCa and PCa metastases from which 24 are adenocarcinomas and 4 are neuroendocrine models. Unsupervised gene expression array clustering analyses revealed (a) association between the xenograft and the originating specimen, (b) pairing of androgen-sensitive lines with their castration-resistant offspring, (c) a distinction between adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine phenotypes and (d) that gene expression profiles were not significantly altered by continuous passage in vivo for 2-8 years. Furthermore, we have performed extensive characterization of these models that includes', ' (a) basic histology, (b) serum PSA levels, (c) tumor doubling time, (d) expression of multiple biomarkers by immunohistochemistry (IHC), (e) oligo array profiles, (f) expression of the androgen receptor (AR) and its splice variants, (g) bone response, and (h) response to therapy, i.e. androgen ablation and docetaxel.

        "Background":"['The AGC kinase AKT is a key component of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which is frequently deregulated in cancer, making AKT a target of major therapeutic interest. However, PI3K signaling through both AKT-dependent and AKT-independent mechanisms involving other AGC kinases, such as p70S6K, PKA, SGK and ROCK, is important in a range of cancers. Hence, the pharmacological inhibition of these multiple AGC kinases may increase response rates and minimize clinical resistance compared with targeting AKT alone. The clinical drug candidate AT13148 is a multi-AGC kinase, ATP-competitive inhibitor, identified utilizing high-throughput X-ray crystallography and fragment-based lead discovery techniques. Screening of this oral small molecule against a panel of kinases at 10M revealed >80% inhibition of the structurally related AGC kinases AKT, PKA, ROCK2, p70S6K, MSK, RSK1/2, and SGK. We demonstrate that AT13148 has antiproliferative activity in a range of in vitro models harboring relevant genetic abnormalities, including PTEN, KRAS, PIK3CA and HER2 aberrations. AT13148 caused substantial blockade of AKT, p70S6K, PKA, ROCK and SGK substrate phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis in both a concentration and time-dependent manner in cancer cells with clinically relevant genetic defects both in vitro and in vivo. Antitumor efficacy in HER2-positive, PIK3CA-mutant BT474 breast, PTEN-deficient PC3 human prostate cancer and PTEN-deficient MES-SA uterine tumor xenografts was demonstrated. We show for the first time that induction of AKT phosphorylation at serine 473 by AT13148, as reported for other ATP competitive inhibitors of AKT, is not a therapeutically relevant reactivation step for this compound. We used gene expression microarray studies to characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms of action of AT13148 and the selective AKT inhibitor CCT128930, and observed the induction of upstream regulators including insulin receptor substrate-2 and PIK3IP1 due to compensatory feedback loops, consistent with blockade of AKT signaling. These studies also showed that AT13148 and CCT128930 have distinct molecular effects in cancer cells', ' AT13148 had a predominant effect on apoptosis genes and caused a greater apoptotic phenotype, while CCT128930 modulated genes in the network regulating cell cycle. This finding emphasizes the functional differences of AT13148 as a multi-AGC kinase inhibitor in contrast to a more AKT-selective inhibitor. In view of the potential mechanistic advantages detailed above, and the potent antitumor activity observed at well tolerated doses against established human tumor xenografts with clinically relevant genetic drivers, the clinical utility of such an AGC kinase inhibitor strategy will now be assessed in a first-in-human Phase I trial of AT13148.']",

        "Background":"['The mTOR pathway is frequently over-activated in human cancers. However, classic allosteric mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and its analogs only exert limited clinical benefits in patients. It has been shown that many tumors either fail to respond to rapamycin initially or are able to acquire resistance after the initial treatment of rapamycin. Such primary and secondary resistances remain as major concerns in rapamycin-based anti-cancer therapies that may inevitably lead to therapeutic failure. We have previously shown that the ATP-competitive dual mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055 can significantly inhibit malignant behaviors however its functional efficacies in the rapamycin-resistance setting remains unclear.Cancer cells with wildtype PTEN were selected as models of primary rapamycin resistance since the mTOR pathway is usually less abnormal in these cells. To establish cells with acquired rapamycin resistance, PTEN-null prostate cancer PC-3 cells were gradually treated with increasing concentrations of rapamycin (up to 10 M) until the cells were completely unresponsive to rapamycin (PC-3RR). Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay and clonogenic survival was tested by colony formation assay. m7G pull-down assay was employed to detect the cap-dependent translation. mTOR downstream pathways, including p-S6K (T389)/p-S6 (S235/236), p-4EBP1 (T37/S46) and p-Akt (S473) were detected by Western Blotting.PTEN wildtype and PC-3RR cells essentially failed to respond to rapamycin; IC50 values were greater than 100 nM in PTEN wildtype cells and 1 M in PC-3RR cells. However, for both cell types AZD8055 suppressed proliferation at the nanomolar level in a dose dependent manner, with IC50 values less than 30 nM. Similarly, cellular clonogenic capacity was impaired by AZD8055 to a greater extent than was the case for rapamycin. At the molecular level, AZD8055, but not rapamycin, strongly prevents the dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E, therefore blocking cap-dependent translation. Further, while the p-S6K and p-S6 pathway was potently inhibited by both agents, AZD8055 displayed more striking inhibition on p-4E-BP1 and p-Akt than did rapamycin in all cells tested. Interestingly, similar to rapamycin, AZD8055 slightly increased p-Akt (T308), suggesting the existence of the PI3K-mediated feedback loop. However, the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin did not further sensitize cells to AZD8055, implying such feedback-dependent activation is less responsible for weakening the drug efficacy.These findings indicate that AZD8055 significantly inhibits malignant functions in cancer cells that are highly resistant to rapamycin. Such effects are likely to be associated with the deactivation of rapamycin-insensitive mTOR downstream components such as Akt and 4E-BP1, but not the upstream feedback pathway. These data provide in vitro evidence in support of future evaluation of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors in cancer models that are resistant to rapamycin analogs.']",

The present work investigated the inhibition of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP)-induced prostate carcinogenesis in CYP1A-humanized (hCYP1A) mice by -TmT. Male hCYP1A mice, maintained on the AIN93M diet or the same diet supplemented with 0.3% -TmT, were treated with a dose of PhIP (200 mg/kg, i.g.). At week 40 after PhIP treatment, all mice developed high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (hgPIN) in the dorso-lateral glands. The hgPIN was associated with elevated levels of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), DNMT1, COX-2 and p-AKT, as well as with loss of expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN, E-cadherin, GSTP1 and Nrf2 in the dorso-lateral glands. In the -TmT group, the number of glands with hgPIN (per 100 glands) was significantly lower than the control group (14.6  4.87 vs. 34.81  3.87, p < 0.01). The -TmT treatment also prevented the elevation of 8-oxo-dG, COX-2 and p-AKT and the loss of PTEN and Nrf2. The -TmT treatment significantly increased the plasma levels of -T and -T (to 1.7 and 0.8 M, respectively) as well as their side-chain degradation metabolites, carboxyethyl hydroxychromans and carboxymethylbutyl hydroxychromans (to 2.6-4.0 M, higher than their parent tocopherols). In a short-term experiment, PhIP-treatment elevated levels of 8-oxo-dG, H2AX and DNMT1, and caused gene expression changes in several p53-associated genes, including p53bp1, p21WAF1/CIP1, cyclin D1, Bax, Igf1 and cyclinG1 at 1 and/or 3 days after PhIP treatment. Dietary -TmT treatment partially prevented the elevation of 8-oxo-dG, H2AX and DNMT1. This action may contribute to the prostate cancer preventive effect of tocopherols. The presently observed inhibitory activities of -TmT against prostate carcinogenesis are hypothesized to be due to the decrease of oxidative stress and inhibition of AKT phosphorylation by - and -tocopherols, and this hypothesis remains to be tested further (supported by NIH grants CA159361 & CA133021).']",

Characteristic abnormalities such as 8p loss, 8q gain, trisomy 7, PTEN microdeletions and TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions appear to mediate mechanisms to increase neoplastic transformation in prostate cancer. Current evidence suggests that telomere dysfunction is a likely causative factor for some of these abnormalities on the basis of its relationship to mechanisms such as the break-fusion-bridge cycle that can lead to the onset of chromosomal instability. Methods', ' In this study, we correlated telomere length in various prostatic histologies by quantitative FISH with genomic markers of chromosomal instability by standard FISH and immunohistochemical measures of proliferation in 3 whole mount prostatectomies. Results', ' After analysing approximately 25,000 cells, we found that telomere shortening was correlated with an increase in the number of cells with abnormalities on chromosome 8, such as an increase in the average number of c-myc signals (r~0.35, p~0.02). However, there were no significant correlations with abnormalities such as trisomy 7 or abnormalities of the PTEN locus in any sample. Additional findings included; associations found with the probability of C-MYC aberrations in stroma with greater proximity to cancer (<1,000 um), a correlation between telomere length in a number of prostatic histologies (normal, atrophy, HPIN and cancer) with the adjacent stroma, and a lack of correlation between the Ki67 index of various histologies and their telomere length - all suggesting the importance of microenvironmental effects on telomere maintenance in the prostate. Finally, we also report significant telomere shortening in BPH in 2 cases, a phenomenon that has not been noted previously.

Methods', ' 9225 CTCs from 319 blood samples from 179 mCRPC pts were detected and digital phenotypically profiled using the Epic Sciences platform.

Next, 856 CTCs representing each subtype were individually whole genome sequenced for copy number variation and genomic instability, to define phenogenomic single cell profile and taxonomy. Tx outcomes were associated with CTC profiles. Results', ' Pre-therapy identification of certain CTC phenotypic subtypes was associated with poor overall survival (OS) following ARSi and/or taxanes. 5/15 subtypes existed primarily in pts w/ high CTC het (84-94%, Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05, permutation test), and linked to amp of AR and cMYC, and loss of TP53 and PTEN. Clusters of genomic events were linked to phenotypic features (i.e. small cell CTC w/AuroraK & nMYC amp) and provide single cell phenogenomic associations with pathways such as AR/PTEN feedback and DNA repair machinery.

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (over 30% of all cancer in men) and the second leading cause of cancer death in men. Statins, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are potent cholesterol lowering drugs. Recent epidemiology suggests that statins prevent aggressive PCa development. In previous cell experiments we have shown that statins can down-regulate nuclear Akt responses to insulin (J Biol Chem 2010; 285, 27900). We showed that atorvastatin decreases nuclear phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) levels in pancreatic and lung cancer cell lines within minutes. These effects were mediated by the P2X7 receptor, and its natural ligand, extracellular ATP, induced the same effects as statins. Our published work also implicates PTEN, PHLPP1 and 2 and other phosphatases, which form protein complexes. Akt has oncogene activity in PCa and many other cancer types, and we have now tested the possibility that the P2X7-Akt pathway is of importance for the anticipated anticancer effects of statins in the prostate. We performed SNP analysis of two cohorts of PCa patients (Cgems and Gasp). We found significant associations for SNPs in Akt1, Caveolin1, P2X7, NEDD4-1 and EHBP1 genes. NEDD4-1 negatively regulates PTEN. EHBP1 is a previously shown risk factor for aggressive PCa, and has been implicated in plasma membrane trafficking. A signaling pathway analysis (Hum Hered 2011; 71, 11) also indicated significant associations to PCa (p = 0.043). EHBP1 showed the strongest influence. In additional cell studies we employed PCa cells and found that knock down of EHBP1 or p110 (previously shown to have oncogenic activity in PCa; Nature 2008; 454, 776) prevented depletion of nuclear Akt. In further long term cell experiments (several weeks) we found that high concentrations of statins resulted in a decreased expression of p110. We also overexpressed a mutated NEDD4-1 and this treatment inhibited the effect of statin on nuclear pAkt in PCa cells (DU145). Taken together this study provides evidence for a role of a putative P2X7-EHBP1-Akt axis in PCa development. As this pathway is negatively regulated by statins it may have a role in the indicated chemo-preventive effect of statins.']",

        "Background":"['Podoplanin (PDPN) is a mucin like type-1 transmembrane protein consisting of 162 amino acids, which comprises a highly glycosylated extracellular domain and a nine amino acid intracellular domain. The specific expression of PDPN on lymphatic but not on blood vascular endothelial cells has established application as a histological marker for lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic vessels in different species. PDPN is highly expressed in tumors of different origin, including squamous cell cancers, germinal neoplasia and tumors of the central nervous system. Recently, we found strong overexpression of PDPN in human astrocytic brain tumors, specifically in primary glioblastoma multiforme (GB). Regulation of PDPN expression involves increased PI3 kinase activation, subsequent activation of protein kinaseB/Akt and the downstream transcription factor AP-1. Activation of this pathway is mediated by loss of PTEN function, consistently, mice lacking Pten exhibit elevated Pdpn protein levels in the subventricular zone of the brain tissue. Additionally, PDPN expression is subject to negative transcriptional regulation by promoter methylation in human GB and in glioma cell lines. In patients high expression of PDPN is associated with poor prognosis. Silencing of PDPN results in a decrease in proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cell lines in vitro and slows down the migration in orthotopic brain slices. Consistently, tumor formation after injection of PDPN knock-down cells into SCID mice is significantly reduced compared to tumors after injection of parental cells. These data highlight a functional role of PDPN in glioma progression and suggest targeting of PDPN expression as a promising strategy for the treatment of patients with primary GB.']",

AKT, a central element in the pathway, is essential for tumor growth, proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis. Activation of AKT is a key mechanism in resistance to chemo-, radio- and targeted therapies. Thus, AKT is considered an attractive drug target. Herein, we report on the preclinical profile and combinability of BAY 1125976, a potent, highly selective, allosteric AKT1/2 inhibitor, which is particularly effective in models with PI3K-AKT pathway aberrations. In biochemical assays, BAY 1125976 demonstrates equal potency against AKT1 and AKT2 in the low nanomolar range (IC50  10 nM) while it displays weaker activity against AKT3 (IC50  500 nM) and is inactive against 230 other protein/ lipid kinases (IC50 > 1 M). Mechanistically, BAY 1125976 blocks AKT signalling by inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT at both Thr308 and Ser473 (IC50 < 1 nM), as well as downstream phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (IC50 < 50 nM). The strong inhibition of cellular p-AKT and downstream signalling translates to a broad inhibition of tumor cell proliferation in vitro. In particular, tumor cell lines carrying defects in the tumor suppressor PTEN, or oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA are most sensitive to BAY 1125976 treatment. Daily oral dosing of BAY 1125976 in human xenograft tumor models induces strong pharmacodynamic inhibition of AKT phosphorylation that correlates with drug exposure. In vivo, BAY 1125976 demonstrates dose-dependent anti-tumor efficacy in multiple xenograft tumor models of different histological types with PIK3CA mutations or PTEN deletions while being well tolerated. BAY 1125976 can be effectively combined with various anti-cancer therapies. In vitro combination profiling shows synergistic anti-proliferative effects with anti-hormonal therapeutics in breast and prostate cancer cell lines, which translates to enhanced anti-tumor efficacy with durable tumor regressions in vivo. Furthermore, in vivo combination of BAY 1125976 with external beam radiation results in strong additive to synergistic efficacy and significant tumor growth delay. Moreover, the combination of BAY 1125976 with the bone-targeting agent Radium 223 in a breast cancer bone metastasis model results in reduced tumor and metastases burden and increased necrotic and fibrotic bone area. In conclusion, BAY 1125976 is a highly selective, potent allosteric AKT1/2 inhibitor with strong in vitro and in vivo activity in tumor models with activated AKT signalling and strong synergistic activity in combination. Targeting AKT might also provide a promising strategy for overcoming chemo/radio-resistance and increasing radio-sensitization and radio-potentiation.']",

In addition, whether resveratrol intervention suppresses the development and progression of PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) is unknown. In this study, we examined the role of SIRT1 and the underlying mechanism involved in resveratrol-mediated biological effects. Our results show that although resveratrol significantly inhibited proliferation of multiple prostate cell lines including RWPE-1, C42B, PC3 and DU145 at higher concentrations (> 50 M); however, at lower concentrations (< 25 M), resveratrol prompted cell proliferation. Interestingly androgen responsive LNCaP cells exhibited resistance to resveratrol-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation. Under these experimental conditions, we also observed significant increase in autophagy without remarkable increase in apoptosis. Given the role of Akt/mTOR signaling pathway as a negative regulator of autophagy, we investigated whether resveratrol induce autophagy via modulation of Akt/mTOR signaling. Our data indicate that resveratrol-induced autophagy was associated with decreased levels of mTORC1 activity and increased SIRT1 expression. Knockdown of SIRT1 enhanced prostate cell proliferation and attenuated resveratrol-induced autophagy. Using prostate specific PTEN/ mice, we found that dietary administration of resveratrol reduced the incidence of high-grade PIN lesions significantly.

In addition, gene expression can be altered during the course of the disease and is accelerated under the influence of therapy. This imposes the need for a tumor biopsy each time therapeutic intervention is required.Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) represent a unique opportunity for a real time liquid biopsy. Current available CTC counting technologies are hampered by inefficiency to isolate individual CTC for further molecular characterization to unveil the best treatment strategy. Here we introduce a simple solution to obtain and analyze the genetic make-up of individual CTC from a CTC enriched cell suspension.Methods Healthy donor blood is drawn into CellSave tubes and spiked with cells of the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Samples are processed between 24 and 96 hours using the CellSearch system. The full content of the CellSearch cartridge is transferred to a self-sorting nanowell plate. After identification on a fluorescence microscope single and multiple LNCaP's and WBC are punched out of the plate using a needle and deposited into tubes by using an automated X,Y stage. The DNA is amplified using the Ampli-1 kit from Silicon Biosystems (SB).Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) products are labeled with Cy-3 and Cy-5 and hybridized to an Agilent sureprint microarray slide. Data was analyzed with the Agilent Genomic workbench software. To show the compatibility with different WGA kits, Self Sorting Nanowell plates with mixed and sorted, differentially stained LNCaP, PC-3 and SKBR3 cells were prepared. Single cells were punched into wells and amplified with three WGA kits\", ' New England Biolabs (NEB) Single Cell WGA kit, the GE Genomiphi kit and the SB Ampli-1 Kit. Evagreen was added to follow the reactions in realtime. Specificity of the system was shown by Sanger sequencing of each cell line for two specific mutations in the ROBO-1 and Pten genes.ResultsCells that are captured, stained and quantified by the CellSearch system have been isolated using self-sorting nanowell Plates. Array CGH using the Ampli-1 WGA products of these cells shows the identification of the LNCaP cell line for amplified single cell and multi cell samples.

Melanoma has been the tumor of choice for the evaluation of a wide variety of therapeutic approaches that rely on stimulation of the immune system to combat cancer. The striking responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors noted in some melanoma patients have now been observed in several other malignancies, including renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. These findings are very encouraging, however the specific mechanisms of response and reasons why only a subset of patients respond to therapy are not known. The extraordinary potential of immune therapies in cancer suggests that human-relevant mouse models of cancer are required to understand mechanisms of response and to optimize therapy so that a larger proportion of patients respond.We have generated and evaluated a series of genetically engineered mouse models driven by alterations in Braf, Pten, Cdkn2a, beta catenin, p53, and Nras that reflect the genetic diversity of the vast majority of human melanoma. We have backcrossed 6 of these models to C57Bl/6, generated tumors, and isolated a series of over 20 congenic mouse melanoma cell lines. Several independent lines have been isolated for each melanoma genotype generated. Injection of these lines into C57Bl/6J mice results in reproducible tumor formation in the absence of co-injection of Matrigel. We are in the process of characterizing the tumor microenvironment in each of the models using flow cytometry and a novel quantitative imaging approach of histological sections, which produces flow cytometry-like data, but retains spatial and morphologic information that can be utilized to characterize much smaller tumors.

Dasatinib, an oral inhibitor of SFKs and other kinases, is active in preclinical CRPC models and in a subset (~20%) of CRPC patients. These results support the use of dasatinib as a targeted therapy for CRPC, but highlight an unmet need to qualify predictive biomarkers of sensitivity to the drug to guide treatment selection. Methods', ' A novel statistical approach for determining characteristically expressed genes (biomarkers) and optimal clustering of discretized expression profiles was applied to a published gene expression dataset of PC cell lines with variable sensitivity to dasatinib (GSE9633) and to a panel of 150 banked primary and metastatic PC specimens. Results', ' We identified 68 unique transcripts, each predicting in vitro sensitivity or resistance to dasatinib with 100% accuracy. Many of the transcripts identified regulate transcription, TGF, Myc, Akt/PTEN and hormone-independent signalling, and have established roles in CRPC pathophysiology, supporting the biological relevance of the signature. Moreover, 56/131 (43%) primary and 5/19 (26%) metastatic tumor specimens were predicted to be sensitive to dasatinib. Applying this PC-derived signature to a panel of breast cancer cell lines predicted in vitro sensitivity to the drug with 78% accuracy, suggesting the presence of common biological pathways. Conclusions', ' The predicted frequency of sensitivity to dasatinib in metastatic PC specimens was comparable to the PSA decline rate in phase II trials enrolling unselected CRPC patients. We are currently quantifying the expression of these transcripts by multiplex qRT-PCR in circulating tumor cells harvested from CRPC patients that will be enrolled in a clinical trial to generate evidence to qualify the signature as a noninvasive predictive biomarker of sensitivity to dasatinib in patients with CRPC.']",

Extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of this novel scaffold showed that the best analog in this series, ABI-231, has an average IC50 = 5.2 nM against panels of melanoma and prostate cancer cell lines, is orally bioavailable, and strongly suppress melanoma tumors in vivo. Analyses of the potential binding pose of ABI-231 at the colchicine binding pocket suggested small substitutions to the indole moiety in ABI-231 could further increase its interactions to tubulin.Based this hypothesis, we have established an efficient synthetic method for the synthesis of ABI-231 analogs by either rotating the indole ring or introducing substituents on the indole of ABI-231. Using this method, we synthesized and tested 27 analogs of ABI-231. Several of the compounds show excellent potency against a panel of melanoma cancer cell lines with a diverse genomic background (mutations in BRAF, TP53, CDKN2A and PTEN) that are frequently encountered in clinical metastatic melanoma tumors. Additionally, they are not substrates for the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) efflux pump and therefore strongly inhibited the multidrug resistant cell lines. The potency of the compounds was further verified by their potent growth inhibition of cancer cell colonies. Results from cell cycle analysis, apoptosis evaluation and tubulin polymerization inhibition are consistent with their expected mechanisms of action. Potential off-target analyses performed by Eurofins Cerep-Panlabs SafetyScreen 44 indicated that they are clean and does not inihibt any of the tested off-targets at 100 fold of its IC50 value in melanoma cells, suggesting the good safety profile for this compound and the probably these scaffold in general.

Selective pressures (including multiple lines of therapy) can lead to tumor evolution through step-wise accumulation of genomic alterations. CTCs from mCRPC pts have shown phenotypic heterogeneity in size, shape, CK expression (exp) and AR exp. Heterogeneity increases with multiple lines of therapy and is associated with treatment resistance. Defining CTC genotype to phenotype correlation may enable identification of emerging resistant clones for which a change in tx may be needed. We performed NGS whole genome CNV analysis at the single CTC level to detect driver somatic alterations associated with CTC epithelial & AR exp profiles.  Methods', '  147 CTCs were individually sequenced from 9 mCRPC pt blood samples and classified as traditional, CK-, or small CTCs and analyzed for AR exp. CTCs were individually isolated, lysed, WGA, library constructed, sequenced, aligned, parsed, normalized, and subtracted from germline CNV. Each pt CTC CNV profile was used to identify distinct sub-clonal populations and characterize CTC genomes. The genomic alterations were associated with CTC phenotypes.  Results', '  Within each pt, 2-5 clonal populations were identified. On average, 11 CNV events were detected per CTC, with an intra-patient CTC correlation of 30-59%.

Two of the principal molecular mechanisms of progression to the castrate-resistant state include loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor pathway and alterations in androgen receptor signaling through mutation or amplification. These pathways contribute to increased PI3K/mTOR signaling and AR-dependent signaling, respectively, which leads to progressive tumor growth, survival, treatment resistance, and metastasis.

        "Background":"[\"The paralogous C-terminal binding proteins (collectively CtBP) 1 and 2 are evolutionarily conserved transcriptional co-regulators which demonstrate oncogene-like properties such as allowing for the progression of EMT and cellular invasion/migration, and supporting cellular survival through suppression of tumor suppressors (PTEN, p16, E-cadherin, BRCA-1) and pro-apoptotic genes (Bik, Puma, Noxa). Overexpression of CtBP is found in colon, ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers, and often correlates with loss of the tumor suppressors ARF and APC and with poorer prognosis for the patient. CtBP is also an emerging cancer drug target, encoding a dehydrogenase domain that can be targeted with small molecule inhibitors to kill cancer cells. CtBP appears to fit the criteria for a driver oncogene, though has never been fully characterized as such. To investigate the hypothesis that CtBP is a transforming oncogene, we subjected CtBP2 to multiple assays for cellular oncogenic activity including loss of contact inhibition, invasion, and anchorage independent growth. Previously immortalized NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts expressing CtBP2 or mutant H-Ras as a positive control were analyzed for focus formation, Matrigel-invasion, and soft agar colony formation. Consistent with the hypothesis that CtBP exhibits properties of an oncogene, CtBP2 potently induced focus formation, Matrigel-invasion, and soft agar colony formation with similar potency to oncogenic mutant H-Ras. Moreover, CtBP2 cooperated with the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein but not H-Ras to transform primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Taken together, the 3T3 and MEF transformation data suggest CtBP2 acts as a Ras-like oncogene in rodent cell transformation assays. Previous research from our lab has shown that CtBP's ability to induce migration in HCT116 cells depends in part on its activation of T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (Tiam1). Work is ongoing to characterize critical downstream targets for CtBP's transforming activity. Targeting CtBP and its dehydrogenase domain in cancers where the protein is found to be overexpressed, or where its regulators, ARF and APC are found to be inactive, could lead to a therapeutic approach specific for an emerging driver oncogene.\"]",

        "Background":"['The PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling cascade is activated in human cancers by elevated membrane receptor activity, mutation, amplification, and deletion of genes encoding components of the pathway. An oncogenic, single hotspot mutation in the AKT1 gene, G49A', 'E17K, in the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT1, was described in human cancers with highest relative incidence in breast cancer. The E17K mutation in AKT1 results in PI3K-independent membrane recruitment of AKT1.Recently we reported the development of a highly selective, potent allosteric AKT1/2 inhibitor BAY 1125976 with strong in vitro and in vivo activity in tumor models with activated AKT signaling and strong synergistic activity in combination.The efficacy of BAY 1125976 was evaluated in tumor models carrying activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway by either deletion of PTEN or activating mutation in PI3K.We investigated whether BAY 1125976 can also inhibit AKT signaling in cell lines carrying an activating mutation in AKT. To this extend, KU-19-19 (AKT1E17K; NRASQ61R) bladder cancer as well as LAPC4 (AKT1E17K) prostate cancer cell lines both bearing the AKT1E17K mutation were profiled. BAY 1125976 potently inhibited AKT activation as well as downstream signaling in KU-19-19 and LAPC4 cells.Furthermore, anti-tumor efficacy of BAY 1125976 was tested in the patient-derived anal cancer xenograft AXF 984 (AKT1E17K). BAY 1125976 shows dose-dependent potent pathway activity in AKT1mut patient derived tumor model with inhibition of pAKT473 as well as downstream targets p- PRAS40 and p-FOXO3a compared to selected PI3K, AKT and mTOR inhibitors.Continuous daily treatment of AXF 984 (AKT1E17K) mouse xenografts with 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg QD p.o. BAY 1125976 resulted in very potent statistically significant anti-tumor efficacy. All animals of these treatment groups exhibited tumor shrinkage or disease control with response rates of 88% and 83%, respectively. Furthermore, for animals treated with 50 mg/kg BAY 1125976 the delay of reaching a relative tumor volume of 600% was statically significant compared to the vehicle-treated control group.In summary, BAY 1125976 showed superior anti-tumor activity in AKT1E17K mutated models compared to PI3K and mTOR inhibitors.

Accumulating studies have witnessed the malfunction of many chemotherapeutic regimens and the current standard-of-care therapy, gemcitabine (GEM), enhances patient survival by only few months. Cucurbitacins, naturally occurring dietary tetracyclic triterpenoid compounds, have shown promising anti-cancer activities. Herein, we investigated the potency and anti-cancer efficacy of a novel analogue of cucurbitacin (Cuc D) in pancreatic cancer cell lines and in a xenograft mouse model. Additionally, we determined efficacy of this analogue on MicroRNAs (miRNAs) which are important regulators of genes that have crucial roles in pancreatic tumorigenesis.Methods', ' The effect of Cuc D on the growth of pancreatic cancer cells was determined by cell proliferation assay using six pancreatic cancer (MiaPaCa-2, CaPan-1, HPAF-II, Panc-1, BxPC-3 and AsPc-1) cells. Cell growth kinetic assay was carried out at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. The clonogenic potential of cancer cells was also studied using the colony formation assay. Tumor suppressor miR-145, which is downregulated in pancreatic cancer, directly target MUC13. Thus the effect of Cuc D was also investigated on the expression of miR-145 through qPCR analysis. Immunoblotting techniques were performed to study the known direct targets of miRNA-145 and its associated proteins. The anti-cancer potential of Cuc D in pancreatic cancer was also evaluated in vivo using a xenograft mouse model.Results', ' Our results demonstrate potent anticancer effects of Cuc D on pancreatic cancer cells. Cuc D induces dose and time dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in a panel of gemcitabine sensitive/resistant pancreatic cancer cell line models at nanomolar concentrations (100-500 nM). It also inhibits colony formation and invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, Cuc D blocks the cell cycle progression in G2/M phase and decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential in pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, Cuc D significantly increases the expression of tumor suppressor miR-145 in HPAF-II cells as observed by qPCR. Furthermore, Cuc D decreases the expression of MUC13 and its associated proteins including pAKT and HER2. In addition, it restores the expression of p53 level as studied by immunofluorescence technique. The expression of key oncogenic proteins including NF-B, STAT3 (Tyr-705) and Mcl-1 were also downregulated. The levels of PTEN and p27 (Kip1) tumor suppressor genes were increased after Cuc D treatment. Additionally, in vivo administration of Cuc D effectively inhibited pancreatic tumor growth in xenograft mouse model.Conclusion', ' Overall, this study suggests that Cuc D modulates the expression of key oncogenes and tumor suppressors, thus it can be a promising therapeutic modality for pancreatic cancer prevention and treatment.']",

The average number of genomic alterations (likely but not confirmed to be somatic) detected was five per patient from a panel of 320 genes. Molecular modifications that are linked to a treatment option were observed in 44% of patients. Twenty four of 144 patients (17%) had mutations in at least one DNA repair gene potentially benefiting from platinum or PARP inhibitor-based therapies, including BRCA2 (5%), ATM (4%), BAP1 (4%), SMARCA4 (3%), FANC (1%), CHEK2 (1%), and PALB2 (<1%). Other actionable molecular phenotypes observed include anti-HER2 therapies targeting ERBB2 amplifications (3%) and mTOR inhibitors suitable for patients with mutations in STK11/LKB1 (7%), PTEN (3.5%), PIK3R1 (<1%), or PIK3CA (3%). Actionable alterations identified with a low frequency (<2%) include RET fusions, amplifications of FGFR, CRKL, AXL, and mutations in NTRK3, MEN1 (PNET), and BRAF. One patient harbored the BRAF V600E mutation, prompting consideration of off label melanoma-approved therapy. Overexpression of ALK by IHC was observed in one patient who chose to enroll in a ceritinib clinical trial. Six percent of patients were PDL-1 positive, and 22% were positive for PD-1 from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, suggesting possible activity from immune checkpoint inhibitors.To date, 7 of the 152 patients have enrolled in a clinical trial, 4 were treated with an off label treatment, 67 have yet to make their next treatment decision, and 53 are known to be deceased.

Often, targeted therapies require prior knowledge of a patient's somatic mutational status and overall tumor heterogeneity at therapeutic decision points for optimum efficacy. CTCs are a product of tumor metastasis and their heterogeneity is reflective of tumor clonal evolution in response to treatment decisions and/or sequence. We sought to develop a method to characterize genomic heterogeneity of CTCs by NGS mediated CNV analysis. Typically, CTC detection platforms enrich CTCs by epithelial cell surface markers or physical properties in pools of CTCs. The loss of cells without typical CTC characteristics and the lack of single cell resolution may bias clonal evolution monitoring. The Epic Sciences CTC platform is a non-selective method for the detection and characterization of CTCs with single cell resolution, enabling individual phenotype to genotype comparisons. Characterization of CTC sub-populations at this level, prior to therapeutic decisions and in response to targeted therapy may represent a paradigm shift in the treatment of cancer.Methods\", ' 2 healthy donor blood samples were spiked with 1 of 3 prostate cancer cell lines (n = 6).

        "Background":"[\"Studies of genetic variation in solid tumors have revealed massive cell-to-cell heterogeneity within single tumors, leading to a surge of interest in reconstructing processes of tumor progression at the cellular level. These efforts are hindered by a lack of accurate quantitative models of tumor evolution processes and computer algorithms to analyze tumor heterogeneity data with respect to these models. We have previously developed algorithms to infer likely tumor phylogenetic trees from single-cell fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) gene copy number data, which has the advantage of making it practical to profile thousands of single cells and thus to survey hundreds of cells per tumor across tens of tumors. We have further shown that these phylogenetic reconstructions of a tumor's past evolution have significant predictive power for future progression of those tumors in a variety of cancer types. In the present work, we address the need for accurate models of tumor evolution through new methods to infer FISH-based tumor phylogenies while simultaneously learning tumor-specific models of evolution by copy number variation at the single gene, single chromosome and whole genome scales.We have applied these algorithms to four FISH data sets\", ' i) cervical cancers collected from paired primary and metastasis from 16 patients and probed at for four genes (LAMP3, PROX1, PRKAA1 and CCND1) measured for up to 250 cells per tumor, ii) tongue cancers collected from 65 patients at four tumor stages and probed at for four genes (TERC, CCND1, EGFR and TP53) measured for up to 250 cells per patient, iii) prostate cancers collected from 6 non-progressive and 7 progressive carcinomas and probed at six genes (TBL1XR1, CTTNBP2, MYC, PTEN, MEN1 and PDGFB) measured in up to 407 cells per patient, and iv) ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast collected as paired samples from 13 patients and probed at eight genes (COX2, MYC, CCND1, HER2, ZNF217, DBC2, CDH1 and TP53) and measured on up to 220 cells per tumor. Statistical analysis of inferred cervical cancer trees allowed us to distinguish progressing from non-progressing primary tumors with 86% accuracy, while similar statistics derived from tongue cancers allowed us to significantly classify tumors with good versus bad prognosis with respect to overall (P-value = 0.0000394) and disease-free (P-value = 0.000117) survival, independent of tumor stage and smoking behavior. These results improve on our best prior accuracies for each of these tasks, providing validation for the model inference approach while also providing new methods relevant to the problem of predicting future progression of tumors.']",

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in men. While some of the causes of prostate neoplasia are subject of intensive research, the influence of genetic predisposition as well as diet and other environmental factors are not well studied. Recently it has been shown that prenatal exposure to ethanol makes the offspring more susceptible to the development of childhood cancers. However, it is not known whether prenatal ethanol induces fetal programming for prostate neoplasia. In order to test this, we fed pregnant rats a liquid diet containing alcohol, some were pair-fed with isocaloric liquid diet, or other were fed ad libitum with rat chow between gestational days 7 and 21. A group of male offspring rats were sacrificed at 7 to 8 months of age and their prostates were removed for histopathology. Another group of male offspring rats were treated with N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU) and testosterone to induce prostate neoplasia. After the tissue was processed, the ventral, lateral, and dorsal parts of the epithelium were viewed under a microscope to determine whether the tissue exhibited normal histology, or abnormalities in the form of atypia, low-grade, or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Additionally, levels of various cellular proteins associated with prostate pathology were determined by immunohistochemistry. The prostates of most (77%) of the alcohol exposed animals, but not ad lib-fed or pair-fed animals, demonstrated atypical hyperplasia, atypia-dysplasia characterized by nuclear stratification, and epithelial evagination with intense inflammatory infiltration in the ventral prostate gland. Furthermore, a significant number of in utero alcohol exposed animals developed high-grade PIN, whereas control animals developed hyperplasia and low grade PIN during adulthood in response to NMU and testosterone treatments. We also found increased levels of estradiol receptor (ER)-alpha, decreased levels of androgen receptor (AR) in the dorsal and ventral prostate, and low levels of circulating testosterone in alcohol-fed offspring who were not treated with carcinogens. In addition, these rats showed a decreased level of E-cadherin and increased Ki-67 in the ventral prostate. Fetal alcohol exposed rats treated with carcinogens showed increased levels of Ki-67 with concomitant decreased levels of PTEN and Nkx3.1 in the ventral prostate epithelium. The protein data corroborates well with the increased neoplastic transformation of the ventral prostatic cells in fetal alcohol exposed rats. These results suggest for the first time that prenatal ethanol exposure induces pre-malignant lesions in prostatic cells and increases the susceptibility toprostate cancer.

        "Background":"['We describe computational methods to compute likely evolutionary histories from tumor single-cell copy number data and next generation sequencing data and apply the methods to data collected from diverse types of tumors. Experimental techniques for assessing heterogeneity in tumor cell populations have undergone great advances, but these improvements have created a great need for more sophisticated computer algorithms capable of making sense of these data sources in terms of coherent models of tumor evolution. We have addressed this problem by developing computer algorithms for building phylogenetic trees describing evolution of individual tumors based on copy numbers of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes from single cells in these tumors. These algorithms reconstruct evolutionary trees for observed cell populations so as to heuristically minimize the number of mutational events needed to explain the observed combinations of probe counts by evolution from a common diploid ancestral cell. We have extended this work from initial simple evolutionary models of evolution by single copy number changes to account for distinct mechanisms of evolution at the gene, chromosome, or whole-genome scale, with potentially different rates of evolution by mutation type. We have applied these algorithms to several FISH data sets, including cervical cancers probed for four genes (LAMP3, PROX1, PRKAA1 and CCND1) measured for up to 250 cells of paired primary and metastatic samples from 16 patients, head-and-neck cancers probed for four genes (TERC, CCND1, EGFR and TP53) measured on up to 250 cells per patient for 65 patients at four tumor stages, prostate cancers probed for six genes (TBL1XR1, CTTNBP2, MYC, PTEN, MEN1 and PDGFB) measured for up to 407 cells in 6 non-progressive and 7 progressive carcinomas, and breast cancers probed for eight genes (COX-2, MYC, CCND1, HER-2, ZNF217, DBC2, CDH1 and TP53) measured on up to 220 cells of paired of ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal carcinoma samples from 13 patients. We have then applied statistical and machine learning analysis to examine the ability of these trees to classify tumors by stage or potential for progression. The evolutionary tree models reveal robust features of evolutionary processes distinguishing progression stages and predicting future progression that lead to improved classification accuracy relative to predictions from cellular heterogeneity data alone.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Urine excretion is the primary route for arsenic elimination. The bladder may thus be exposed to higher concentrations of arsenic due to the bioconcentration of urine by the kidneys. The molecular etiology of cancer linked to arsenic exposure is complex and multiple factors have been described as playing a role in this process. Although there is extensive epidemiologic evidence of increased risk for the development of urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) associated with arsenic exposure, the mechanisms by which arsenic participates in tumorigenesis are not fully elucidated. Materials and Methods', ' To prepare in vitro model we chronically exposed immortalized normal human bladder cell line (HUC-1) to arsenic. Briefly, HUC1 cells were cultured in 25cm flask in F12K complete medium with or without 1M As2O3. Medium and arsenic was changed every two days. Cells were sub-cultured as necessary and frozen down each month for future studies. Morphology differences were monitored over the entire treatment schedule, using a light microscope. Cell growth was monitored by MTT assay. Tumorigenic properties were analyzed by soft agar and invasion assay. Expression of several key molecules of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway was determined by western blot analysis. Results', ' At 6 months arsenic treated HUC1 cells started to became more rounded and had a tendency to pile on to one another. MTT was performed for each month of treatment in order to determine any changes in cell proliferation due to arsenic treatment. As expected the growth of the HUC1 cells was increased in a time dependent manner after arsenic treatment. Anchorage independent growth was evaluated using soft agar assay. Colonies were observed only in arsenic treated cells and the number of colonies was gradually increased with longer period of treatment. Similarly invaded cells were determined only in arsenic treated cells after 8 months. Withdrawal of arsenic for 2.5 months from 8 and 10 months arsenic treated cells does not reverse the tumorigenic properties. Western Blot analysis of AKT pathway genes, PTEN decreased and AKT and mTOR increased in arsenic treated HUC cells. Conclusion', ' Our study suggests that the exposure of HUC-1 to arsenic rapidly induces a multifaceted dedifferentiation program characterized by increased cell proliferation, anchorage independent growth and invasion, a motive that is also present after the end of the arsenic treatment indicating that such a manifestation seems to be irreversible. Further studies are needed in order to delineate the molecular effect of arsenic exposal to primary urothelial cancer tissue collected from patients exposed to arsenic.

        "Meeting_name":" Increased MMPs activity in MDM2 overexpressing cancer cell lines.",
        "Background":"['The matrix metalloprotenases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidase and have proteolysis activity which found to impact several physiological and pathophysiological conditions including cancer. In cancer, over 20 types of MMPs promote invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, and proliferation. For instance, MMP-9 is involved in many processes such as wound healing, tissue remodeling and regulation of inflammation. So far, several studies have also shown that MMP-9 is associated with poor clinical outcome. MMP-9 can facilitate angiogenesis and metastasis by releasing cytokines, pro-angiogenic and pro-metastatic factors. Conversely, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1) is a well-known negative regulator of MMPs which can also modulate other biological functions independent of MMPs regulation. TIMP-1 dysregulation has been shown to impact ECM integrity and potentiate metastatic ability also. Similarly, MDM2 (Murine Double Minute) has been recognized as an important multi-domain protooncogene which is overexpressed in many types of cancer and is associated with poor prognosis in different tumor types including sarcomas and carcinomas. Previously, our group reported that MDM2 overexpression is regulating MMP-9/TIMP-1 axis in LNCaP and LNCaP-MST (MDM2 transfected) prostate cancer cells. In order to further analyze the status of MMP in MDM2 overexpressing cancers the fluorescence activity assay and the zymography assay were used for measuring the activity of MMPs including MMP-9. Immunoblotting analysis were also used to correlate the expression levels of MDM2, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 in MDM2 overexpressing cell lines with and without Nutlin-3 (20 uM) treatment. Our results indicated that MMP activity is elevated by 97.3 % in LNCaP-MST cells compared to LNCaP. This may be possibly due to the near knockdown levels of TIMP-1 that was observed in LNCaP-MST cells. However, the Nutlin 3 treatment was able to decrease the MMP-9 levels and activity only marginally, without elevating TIMP-1 levels. This suggests that, in addition to MDM2, the PTEN loss in LNCaP-MST cells may also play a role in regulating the levels of TIMP-1 and consequently the activity of MMP-9. Furthermore, in order to verify our original speculation, we analyzed the levels of TIMP-1 in SJSA1 and GI-101A cell lines, which are known to overexpress MDM2 and impart aggressive metastatic abilities. Interestingly, the levels of TIMP-1 were found to be elevated in both SJSA1 and GI-101A cell lines compared to LNCaP-MST cells. This finding indicates that TIMP-1 may paly dual role depending on cancer types and the gene expression status in the tumor microenvironment. Further studies are required to fully delineate the interplay between MDM2 and pro-metastatic mechanisms, including the expression of TIMP-1 and MMP-9.

The prostate cancer cell line LNCAP, expressing most of these genes, was used for spiking experiments. 10 ml blood of eight healthy donors (HDs), five HDs spiked with 10 LNCAP cells and 25 MBC patients were selected for CTC using AdnaTest BreastCancerSelect (AdnaGen AG) resulting in cDNA1. Subsequently, the same sample (with removed target cells) was processed again using the same procedure resulting in cDNA2. cDNA1 and cDNA2 were gene specifically preamplified using TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix according to in house designed assays. qPCR was performed using Bio-Rad SYBR Green Mix. If the CD45 deltaCt was > zero, deltaCt value of a given gene was calculated as the difference between Ct (cDNA2) and Ct(cDNA1). A gene with a deltaCt > zero was considered positive.Results', ' When HDs were tested for all genes, no false positive findings were observed except for AKT2, CD24L4, CD44 (n=3 cases). All of the genes except for TWIST, ER and PR could be positively detected in samples spiked with 10 LNCAP cells. In patient samples, at least one of all studied markers was detected in 21/25 (84%) of the patients. The distribution of the markers across all patients was highly variable. However, PI3K expression was observed most frequently (n=8/21 patients), followed by the expression of CD44 (n=6/21 patients), HER2 (n=5/21 patients) and TWIST, KRAS, mTOR and EpCAM (4/21 patients), respectively. No expression was observed for MUC1, PR and CD45. In general, EMT- and stem cell-like CTC were predominantly detected.

Results', '  1245 pts were randomized (TASQ, n = 832; PBO, n = 413) between 29 Mar 2011 and 7 Dec 2012 at 240 sites in 37 countries. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the 2 groups. In general, all radiology-based and PSA-based secondary endpoints showed statistically significant differences between TASQ and PBO in favor of TASQ. E.g. median time to radiological progression was 8.4 m for TASQ vs. 5.5 m for PBO, p < 0.001, HR (95% CI) 0.628 (0.534-0.739) by central assessment. However, symptomatically assessed endpoints in general showed statistically significant differences in favor of PBO. E.g. median time to symptomatic progression was 9.5 m for TASQ vs. 11.9 m for PBO, p = 0.031, HR (95% CI) 1.171 (1.014-1.353). Grade  3 TEAEs were more common with TASQ than PBO (42.8 vs 33.6%).  Conclusions', '  Outcome of the radiological and PSA-based endpoints favor TASQ in contrast to the symptomatically assessed endpoints, which favor placebo. Overall survival was not improved, which may be due to limited efficacy of TASQ in the studied population, toxicity, or the differential use of effective life-prolonging agents post-TASQ/placebo.

The Combination of CR and Organoids ( (Matrigel, air-liquid interface (ALI)) cultures represents next generation human cancer models and functional diagnostics for cancer precision medicine as described in August in the NCI precision medicine initiative and three nature review articles (Nat Rev Cancer. 2015 Dec; Nat Rev Genet. 2015 Jul; Nat Rev Clin Oncol. 2014 Nov.). The technique is relatively simple and has been reproduced in more than 50 laboratories (including an original and independent article in Science from Massachusetts General Hospital) (Science. 2014, 346(6216)', '1480-6.). Importantly, the CR technology can generate 2106cells in a week from small biopsies, and can generate cultures from cryopreserved tissue and from fewer than four viable cells. We therefore initiated studies to examine whether CR cultures reflected the biology and genotype of the original tumor and whether cultures might be used to predict clinical responses. Methods', ' Surgical specimens from patients with prostate and lung cancer were collected. CR and Organoids cultures were used. Results', ' We first worked out standard protocols for clinical sampling, storage, shipping, freezing and the preparation of conditioned medium. CR methods were then used to generate matched cultures from both tumor cells and adjacent normal cells from patients with prostate cancer or lung cancer. CR cultures were established efficiently from these tumors ( > 95% for prostate and lung cancer CRCs). The data with Organoids cultures demonstrated that CR cells re-expressed cell specific markers and were well-differentiated. We also characterized them for their growth properties, induction of tumors in immunodeficient mice, karyotype, and their exome and transcriptome profile. Conclusions', ' The combination of CR (2D) and Organoids (3D) culture conditions provides optimal conditions for establishing patient-derived cells and for study of translational cancer biology. These cell-based approaches should be useful for defining the functional heterogeneity of the respective primary tumors and for evaluating appropriate therapies.']",

        "Background":"['The phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is one of the most frequently activated pathways in oncogenesis, and controls critical cellular processes such as proliferation, transcription and survival. GDC 0032 is an orally bioavailable, potent, and selective inhibitor of Class I PI3K alpha, delta, and gamma isoforms, with 30 fold less inhibition of the PI3K beta isoform relative to the PI3K alpha isoform. The gene that encodes the p110 alpha isoform of PI3K, PIK3CA, is frequently mutated in breast, colorectal and endometrial cancers. Previously published data demonstrated that GDC-0032 has increased activity against PIK3CA mutant cancer cell lines (Olivero A. et al., DDT02-01, AACR 2013).To determine if there are additional predictive biomarkers outside of PIK3CA mutations for sensitivity to GDC-0032, we profiled over 550 cell lines, encompassing 13 of the main cancer types, to increasing concentrations of GDC-0032. As expected, a small percentage of all tumor types responded to GDC-0032 and, were assessed, correlated strongly with PIK3CA mutations. Intriguingly, the majority of head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) cell lines showed an IC50 concentration of less than 1uM, suggesting that HNSCC cell lines may be particularly susceptible to PI3K inhibition. Molecular profiling identified that only 10% of the HNSCC cell lines had a mutation within PIK3CA, and no consistent copy number alterations were observed in receptor tyrosine kinases or PTEN. To investigate this observation further, we developed a PIK3CA activation algorithm, by utilizing the mutant-selective property of GDC-0032, and calculated a ratio of GDC-0032 to GDC-0941, a pan PI3K inhibitor with reduced in vitro selectivity for PIK3CA mutations. Following a proof of principle experiment in breast cancer cells, a GDC-0941/GDC-0032 ratio of 4 enriched for breast cancer cells with mutant PIK3CA (11 out of 13 cell lines). Application of the algorithm, to our panel of HNSCC cell lines identified 10 out of 34 cell lines that had a GDC-0941/GDC-0032 ratio of 4, with only 1 of these cell lines being PIK3CA mutant. Further molecular characterization identified high mRNA expression of neuregulin-1, the ligand for HER3, in GDC-0032 cell lines with a GDC-0941/GDC-0032 ratio of 4, compared to cell lines with a ratio of <4. Pharmacodynamic analysis of sensitive and refractory HNSCC cell lines demonstrated that GDC-0032 inhibited the phospho-AKT pathway in both groups of cell lines, but GDC-0032 only suppressed downstream phospo-S6 signaling in the sensitive cell lines.In conclusion, high throughput cell line screening identified a PIK3CA activated subset of HNSCC cell lines that correlated with increased neuregulin-1 expression and corresponding sensitivity to GDC-0032, outside of PIK3CA mutations.']",

As of Dec 10, 2015, median follow-up duration was 48.9 wk (range, 5.6-90 wk). 18 (75.0%) pts experienced a treatment-related adverse event (TRAE), with pyrexia (n =4) and rash (n = 3) occurring in 10% of pts. 5 (20.8%) pts had grade 3 TRAEs, 2 of whom discontinued pembrolizumab (colitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome). No grade 4 or 5 TRAEs occurred. ORR (confirmed) was 12.5% (3/24; 95% CI, 2.7%-32.4%; all were PRs); the median duration of response was 19.3 wk (range, 17.7-52.0 wk). The stable disease (SD) rate was 12.5% (3/24; 95% CI, 2.7%-32.4%); the median duration of SD was 19.6 wk (range, 16.3-29.7+ wk). The 6-mo PFS rate was 13.0%; the 6-mo OS rate was 66.7%. Conclusions', ' Pembrolizumab was well tolerated and showed promising antitumor activity in pts with PD-L1+ advanced cervical squamous cell cancer. The clinical benefit of pembrolizumab in advanced cervical cancer will be further investigated in the phase 2 KEYNOTE-158 trial (NCT02628067). Clinical trial information', ' NCT02054806']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Cabazitaxel (CBZ) is registered for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Diarrhea is a common adverse effect, reported in 47% of the patients in the TROPIC trial, with grade 3 or 4 events in 6% of patients (De Bono et al, Lancet 2010). We studied if co-administration of the oral corticosteroid budesonide (BUD) would decrease the incidence and severity of CBZ-induced diarrhea. Previously, we showed that BUD co-administration has no effect on CBZ plasma exposure (de Graan et al, PIII-41, ASCPT 2012). Methods', ' From Dec 2011 to Oct 2015, we performed a multicenter randomized phase II open-label trial in mCRPC patients [NTR2991]. After written informed consent, patients scheduled to receive standard of care CBZ 25 mg/m2 Q3W plus prednisone 5 mg BID were randomized to receive CBZ plus prednisone alone (control arm) or to receive concomitant BUD 9 mg QD during the first 2 treatment cycles (BUD arm). Patients reported the frequency and consistency of stools in a diary. The primary endpoint was the incidence of grade 2-4 diarrhea. To detect a decrease in incidence from 25% to 10% (2-sided  = 0.05 and  = 0.20) 113 evaluable patients per arm were needed. Results', ' Of the 246 included patients, 227 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. Median number of cycles was 6 for both arms. No grade 4 diarrhea was observed. The incidence of grade 3 diarrhea was 4% in both arms. In the BUD arm, 21 of the 114 patients (18%) had grade 2-3 diarrhea, compared with 14 of the 113 (12%) in the control arm (p = 0.208). Median number of stools per day at baseline was 1 in both arms and was maximally 3 (range 1-40) in the BUD arm and 3 (range 1-13) in the control arm. Two patients in the BUD arm and 5 patients in the control arm were hospitalized for diarrhea. In 3 patients diarrhea was one of the reasons for treatment discontinuation. Main other grade 3 adverse events were neutropenia (49%), nausea (1%) and vomiting (1%). Conclusions', ' BUD had no significant effect on CBZ induced diarrhea. Interestingly, the incidence of grade 3-4 diarrhea was slightly lower than that observed in the TROPIC trial, and diarrhea was never the sole reason for treatment discontinuation.

        "Meeting_name":" A phase I study of EC0225 administered weeks 1 and 2 of a 4-week cycle.",
        "Background":"['Background', ' The folate receptor (FR) is expressed on many human tumors (e.g., ovarian, NSCLC, etc.) where it functions as a high-affinity receptor for folic acid. The FR is minimally expressed in normal tissue, making it a logical target for anticancer therapy. Indeed, the relevance of FR as a molecular target for antitumor agents was discussed in detail at the 2008 ASCO Annual Meeting. Folic acid can be used as a carrier molecule to deliver covalently-linked therapeutic and diagnostic moieties to the FR and EC0225 is a conjugate of folic acid coupled to mitomycin-C and desacetyl vinblastine hydrazide (DAVLBH). The EC0225 conjugate is a high-affinity ligand for the folate receptor (FR). This phase I study assessed the safety of escalating intravenous bolus doses of EC0225. Methods', ' Eligible patients with adequate performance status and organ function that had previously failed standard therapy were treated with EC0225 on days 1, 3, 5 (week 1) and 8, 10, 12 (week 2) of a 28-day cycle. Patients in the final cohort received drug on days 1, 3, 5 and 15, 17, 19 of a 28-day schedule. Endpoints included identification of the maximally-tolerated dose (MTD), the toxicity profile and any evidence of antitumor effect. Results', ' As of DEC 2009, 63 patients had received EC0225 at doses of 0.38, 0.8, 1.1, 1.5, 2.3, 3.1 and 3.9 mg (flat dose) and at 2.3 and 2.88 mg/m2; (where n =10, 8, 4, 14, 4, 5, 4, 7 and 7, respectively). EC0225 was generally well tolerated at dose levels  2.3 mg/m2. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events (all grades) included anemia (25%), constipation (17%), leukopenia (12%) and fatigue (10%). Grade 3 hypotension and Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 1 patient each at the highest dose tested (2.88 mg/m2) defining the MTD at 2.3 mg/m2. Longer-term disease stabilization ( 4 months) occurred in patients with colorectal (4, 6 mo.), breast (4 mo.) and prostate cancer (10 mo.) and in patients with leiomyosarcoma (4 mo.) and mesothelioma (4 mo.). Traditional MMC- related pulmonary toxicities were not identified in this study. Conclusions', ' EC0225, a conjugate of folate, mitomycin-C and DAVLBH may be administered safely as a 2.3 mg/m2 intravenous bolus dose on days 1, 3, 5 and 8, 10, 12 of a 28-day schedule.']",

Methods', '  Patients with histologically confirmed advanced ESCC, measureable tumor, and no prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy except adjuvant treatment were enrolled. Patients were given cisplatin 60mg/m2, paclitaxel 175mg/m2per 21 days for at least 2 cycles. The nimotuzumab was given 200mg weekly. Radiotherapy was admitted for patients with unresectable local advanced disease after 4 cycle of TCN treatment. The primary endpoints were safety and objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and over-all survival (OS). The expression of EGFR and ERCC1 were also analyzed by histoimmunochemical staining.  Results', '  Between Mar. 2011 and Dec. 2012, 55 patients with advanced ESCC were enrolled and 53 (96.4%) were eligible for evaluation. The ORR was 54.7% (29/53) and the DCR was 94.3% (50/53). The expression of EGFR and ERCC1 were detected in 46 and 31 patients respectively. The ORR had no relation to both the expression of EGFR (55.3% vs 62.5%, p=0.71) and ERCC1 (41.7% vs 58.3%, p=0.47). As a median follow-up of 15months, the median PFS was 10.5 months (95% CI 8.7 to 12.3 months).The TCN combination treatment was well tolerated and the most common adverse events were alopecia (86.8%), leukopenia (84.9%), anorexia (84.9%), vomiting (73.6%), fatigue (73.6%), pain (66.0%), and anaemia (39.6%).  And 18 (34%) patients had Grade 3 to 4 leukopenia. The median OS have not yet been reached.  Conclusions', '  In this study, the ORR, DCR and PFS are superior to previous published studies. The addition of anti-EGFR treatment of nimotuzumab to standard chemotherapy was well tolerated with no serious AEs. But the expression of EGFR by IHC could not predict the outcome of nimotuzumab treatment. A phase III study of TCN followed by radiotherapy in unresectable local advanced ESCC had been designed to explore the survival benefits. Clinical trial information', ' NCT01336049.']",
