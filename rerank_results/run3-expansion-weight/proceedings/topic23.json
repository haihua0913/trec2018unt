        "Background":"['IntroductionInactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor, a negative regulator of oncogenic PI3K/Akt signaling, occurs in a subset of melanomas and is correlated with disease progression, treatment resistance and reduced patient survival. PTEN loss of function in melanoma is thought to result largely from gene deletion, mutation and/or methylation. However, the low frequency of these genomic alterations cannot explain the higher rate of loss of PTEN protein expression that is observed in melanoma. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that loss of PTEN expression in melanoma might be the consequence of predominantly non-genomic mechanisms, including post-transcriptional and post-translational dysregulation. Specifically, we postulated that PTEN loss in some melanomas might result from aberrant expression of PTENP1, a PTEN pseudogene-derived long non-coding RNA, and from increased PTEN ubiquitination and hence protein degradation.Experimental ProceduresWe performed an integrated analysis of data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n = 276) and metastatic melanoma human specimens from patients enrolled at NYU (n = 48). We examined the frequency of PTEN copy number loss using genomic qPCR, PTEN mutations using targeted sequencing and qPCR mutation arrays, and PTEN methylation status was determined in tumors lacking PTEN deletion or mutation with bisulfite treatment and pyrosequencing. Furthermore, we assessed PTEN and PTENP1 expression in tumor samples by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry.ResultsComplete PTEN deletions were found in 8% of TCGA cases and in 10% of NYU cases, while partial PTEN deletions were detected in 27% of NYU cases. Somatic PTEN mutations were found in 8% of TCGA cases and 3% of NYU cases. The frequency of PTEN methylation at five CpG islands ranged between 0% and 28% and did not predict PTEN protein expression, thus identifying a subset of tumors that exhibit PTEN protein loss despite a lack of detectable PTEN deletions, mutations or methylation. Integration of PTEN and PTENP1 expression data from TCGA and the NYU cohort revealed a strong positive correlation between PTEN and PTENP1 levels in melanoma. Analysis of a role for aberrant PTEN ubiquitination in promoting PTEN loss in melanoma is ongoing.ConclusionsOur data challenge the existing model in which PTEN loss in melanoma is thought to occur primarily as a result of gene deletion, mutation or methylation. Rather, we find that these are uncommon events in melanoma and that PTEN loss may instead be attributed to post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms, such as dysregulation by loss of the PTENP1 long non-coding RNA. A comprehensive understanding of these non-genomic processes could identify novel approaches (PTEN-restoring therapy) to block tumor progression and improve treatment responses and patient survival, suggesting that suppression of PTEN levels in melanoma might be reversible and thus could be exploited clinically.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' PTEN is a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the PI3K signaling pathway by dephosphorylating PIP3, converting it to PIP2. PTEN loss of function results in activation of Akt and downstream signaling pathways, and has been associated with numerous cancers, most commonly endometrial cancer, glioblastoma, melanoma and prostate cancer. PTEN loss can be a result of multiple different aberrations which include mutations in the coding region leading to frame-shift or stop codons, genomic deletions as well as promoter methylation leading to loss of PTEN protein. Determination of PTEN status, both at the DNA and protein levels, may be important for clinical decision-making because loss of PTEN is associated with resistance to various targeted therapies, while inactivating mutations may confer sensitivity to therapeutics targeting PI3K pathway members. We have developed Sanger sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) assays to assess PTEN mutation status in a set of FFPE patient specimens.Methods', ' Our Sanger sequencing assay for PTEN was developed to detect known hotspot mutations in exons 5-8, which occur in the majority of PTEN mutations reported in the COSMIC database. The IHC and CISH assays were developed using commercially available reagents. All assays were validated using a combination of plasmids, cell lines and FFPE tissues for specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility and concordance.Results', ' 22 patient FFPE tissue specimens from a variety of tumor types including colon, lung, pancreas, uterus and prostate were evaluated for PTEN mutation and expression status by both Sanger sequencing and IHC methods. Sequencing results were', ' 9 wild-type, 12 heterozygous mutant, and 1 hemizygous mutant. 7 of the 9 specimens reported as wild-type by sequencing exhibited normal protein expression levels by IHC, while 2 were PTEN negative by IHC, suggesting that mechanisms other than mutations in exons 5-8 contributed to the loss of expression of PTEN protein. These 2 specimens were further analyzed by CISH to determine copy number. Of the 13 specimens reported as mutant by sequencing, IHC protein expression results indicated that 6 were PTEN positive and 7 were PTEN negative, underscoring the observation that exon 5-8 mutation status alone is not sufficient to predict PTEN expression levels. Data on CISH analysis of the specimen that was hemizygous mutant by sequencing will be reported to confirm the copy loss.Conclusion', ' The data suggest that additional mutations outside the exon 5-8 region as well as promoter methylation may result in loss of PTEN protein, and that accurate clinical assessment of PTEN mutation and protein expression status in FFPE tissues requires complimentary methods including Sanger sequencing, IHC and CISH methodologies.']",

Methods', ' A 49 yo woman with ULMS developed rapidly progressive metastatic disease 4 months after R1-resection of the primary tumor and was enrolled on a phase 1b study of pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 wks) (KEYNOTE-028). Tumor regression at multiple metastatic sites occurred within 2 months. A single pre-existing metastasis increased in size and was resected at 9 months. IHC, whole exome/transcriptome sequencing, and neoantigen analysis was performed on primary pretreatment (preRx) and treatment-resistant tumors (postRx). Results', ' Responsive tumor sites revealed complete pathologic response at time of surgery. Progressive tumor demonstrated viable ULMS. IHC showed tumor cells negative for PD-L1 and positive for PD-L2 both preRx and postRx. Degree of PD-1+ lymphocyte infiltration decreased significantly postRx compared to preRx. PreRx harbored exomic focal MYC amplification, TP53 nonsense mutation, and heterozygous PTEN deletion. PostRx maintained these genomic alterations and acquired a loss-of-function mutation in PTEN that resulted in biallelic PTEN inactivation. PreRx tumor expressed tumor-specific neoantigens (TSNs) that were immunogenic to patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells; expression of TSNs decreased postRx. Conclusions', ' This patient exhibited complete pathologic response to pembrolizumab at all but one metastatic ULMS site. Genomic analysis of the resistant tumor revealed acquired bialllelic PTEN loss - recently implicated in resistance to PD-1 inhibition in melanoma and glioblastoma  reduced infiltration of PD-1+ lymphocytes, and diminished expression of neoantigens. To our knowledge, this is the first report of exceptional response to PD-1 inhibition in ULMS, and highlights biallelic PTEN loss and neoantigen downregulation as potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockade across cancer types.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Visualization of endogenous melanoma initiation and progression using intravital microscopy",
        "Background":"['The death rates for malignant metastatic melanoma continue to rise because melanoma is largely refractory to existing therapies. Loss or inactivation of the tumor suppressor PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog on Chromosome Ten) is observed in 40-50% of melanoma, and BRAF and PTEN mutations exist coincidentally in approximately 20% of melanoma cases. In mouse GEMM models, these mutations cooperate to promote metastatic melanomagenesis. However, existing methods to activate these lesions with Tyr-CreERT2 and topical tamoxifen application yields multifocal primary tumors whose origins cannot be accurately determined. To improve this model, we combined a tdTomatoLSL allele that serves as a visual marker of Cre recombination with Tyr-CreERT2;BrafCA;Ptenlox/lox to produce an animal where we can reproducibly initiate tumorigenesis in a spatiotemporally controllable manner by transiently applying extremely low doses (<20 nM) of tamoxifen to the dermis of the ear. Due to melanocyte-specific expression of the fluorescent protein tdTomato, we can track tumor progression from endogenous cells using two-photon intravital imaging. Starting from a single primary tumor on the ear, we can detect distant metastases in cervical lymph nodes and lungs via macroscopic fluorescent imaging, qRT-PCR and histology. We are using this model in combination with targeted therapy to investigate the effects of selective molecular inhibitors on the growth and metastasis of endogenous BRAFV600E/PTEN-/- metastatic melanoma at the cellular level. Preliminary studies using intravital imaging and a selective MEK1/2 inhibitor, GSK212 (Trametinib, FDA approved treatment for metastatic melanoma) show that targeted therapy causes heterogeneous reorganization of the tumor cells as early as 3 days post-treatment. After several weeks of continuous treatment, the remaining, resistant tumor cells are highly correlated spatially with bundled collagen structures detected by second harmonic generation signal, suggesting that cellular milieu strongly influences drug response. In addition, GSK212 treated animals still had lung macro-metastatic tumors, indicating that despite continuous MEK1/2 inhibition, metastatic tumor growth in the lung was still possible. In summary, we have developed an inducible endogenous model of melanoma metastasis that can be used to directly investigate both heterogeneous effects of targeted therapy at the cellular level and the efficacy of targeted therapy against metastasis.']",

        "Background":"['We have developed a somatic cell gene delivery mouse model of human melanoma that allows for rapid validation of genetic alterations identified in this disease. A major advantage of this system is the ability to model the multi-step process of carcinogenesis in immune-competent mice using retroviral-mediated gene delivery. Mutant BRaf has been demonstrated to cooperate with Pten loss to induce metastatic melanoma in mice but the role of Akt in this context has not been evaluated. This is relevant because 60% of human melanomas contain amplification and activation of AKT. In this study, we evaluated the role of mutant Braf in melanoma initiation in the context of Ink4a/Arf loss and Akt activation. Ink4a/Arflox/lox mice expressing the viral receptor TVA specifically in melanocytes under control of the dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) promoter were crossed to Ptenlox/lox mice and mice carrying a conditional BrafV600E allele, which can be activated by Cre expression (BrafCA). Cohorts of newborn mice were injected subcutaneously with retroviruses containing Cre recombinase. Melanoma developed in 100% (8/8) of the DCT-TVA/BrafCA mice following Cre mediated Braf activation combined with Pten and Ink4a/Arf loss; median survival was 62  6.7 days in this cohort. The incidence was reduced to 43% (6/14) if Pten was retained (Pten+/+ mice); median survival of tumor bearing mice in this group was 72  6.7 days. Kaplan Meier survival analysis revealed a highly significant difference between these cohorts (P = 0.01). Interestingly, Akt expression could substitute for Pten loss in this context. Melanoma developed in 88% (15/17) of the DCT-TVA/BrafCA mice following viral delivery of activated Akt and Cre, which mediated Braf activation combined with Ink4a/Arf loss; median survival of tumor bearing mice in this group was 60  6.6 days. Kaplan Meier survival analysis revealed that there was no significant difference between cohorts with Pten loss or Akt expression (P = 0.658). Expression of virally delivered Akt in the absence of Cre did not lead to tumor formation in control cohorts (0/7) and no uninfected mice developed melanoma (0/14). Histological examination of the tumors generated in the BrafCA mice with delivery of Cre and Akt viruses demonstrated that they were very similar to tumors lacking Pten. Importantly, the tumors were similar to human melanoma consisting primarily of short spindle cells exhibiting high grade nuclear features and prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures were abundant, and some tumors possessed giant cells with epitheliod features. Occasional neoplasms exhibited regions of necrosis. Extensive lung metastases were evident following Pten loss or Akt expression, but not in tumors lacking activation of Akt, confirming a role of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in melanoma progression and metastasis. Our ongoing experiments seek to further characterize the role(s) of the PI3K/AKT pathway in melanoma progression.']",

        "Background":"['Although BRAF inhibitors display promising clinical response in BRAFV600 mutant melanoma patients, not all patients respond to these agents and the durability of the response is limited. To improve BRAF targeted therapy, we characterized a panel of BRAFV600 mutant melanoma cell lines and determined their response to cell growth inhibition, apoptosis induction and cell signaling changes by GSK2118436 alone and in combination with the MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 or PI3K/mTOR inhibitor GSK2126458. Nine of 11 BRAFV600E, 4/5 BRAFV600K and 1/1 BRAFV600D mutant lines were sensitive to GSK2118436 (IC50<0.3M). These sensitive lines had wild-type MEK1/2 with or without PTEN mutations. Two of the three lines insensitive to GSK2118436 had either MEK1P124S or MEK2K66_K68del mutations. GSK2118436 treatment decreased MEK and ERK phosphorylation and cyclin D1 in both the sensitive and insensitive lines. However, GSK2118436 decreased S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation (pS6P) only in the sensitive lines. Cell lines sensitive to GSK2118436 were also sensitive to the allosteric MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 (IC50<0.01M). The combination of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 had a synergistic to additive effect on cell growth inhibition in the sensitive lines, but had minimal benefit in the three insensitive lines. Although 5/6 PTEN NULL lines were sensitive to GSK2118436 based on their IC50s, growth of these lines was inhibited less effectively by GSK2118436 compared to the PTEN WT lines evaluated by IC70. PTEN NULL cells displayed higher levels of basal AKT phosphorylation (pAKT) than PTEN WT lines. Treatment of PTEN NULL lines with GSK2118436 increased pAKT while similar treatment of PTEN WT lines decreased pAKT and increased PTEN expression. In combination with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor GSK2126458, GSK2118436 or GSK1120212 effectively inhibited MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR signaling, enhanced cell growth inhibition, and induced apoptosis evaluated by caspase 3/7 activation and/or PARP cleavage in both PTEN WT and PTEN NULL lines. In PTEN deficient lines, these combinations were more effective than the combination of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212. These results indicate MEK1/2 mutations associate with lack of sensitivity to single agent BRAF and MEK inhibitors. In addition, PTEN deficiency may reduce the effectiveness of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. The combination of GSK2118436 with GSK1120212 or GSK2126458 may improve the effectiveness of BRAF targeted therapy in BRAFV600 mutant melanoma. Our results support the testing of GSK2118436 with these combinations in the clinic and warrant further investigation of MEK and PTEN mutation status and pS6P as a pharmacodynamic marker to improve treatment outcome in BRAFV600 mutant melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['T cell-mediated immunotherapies are promising cancer treatments. However, most patients still fail to respond to these therapies. The molecular determinants of immune resistance are poorly understood. Here, we interrogated the role of loss of expression of the tumor suppressor, PTEN, in immune resistance.In preclinical studies, we found that silencing PTEN in tumor cells inhibited T cell-mediated tumor killing and decreased T cell trafficking into tumors. In clinical studies, we observed that tumors with loss of PTEN had significantly less CD8+ T cell infiltration than PTEN-present tumors. In addition, 26% of melanomas that did not yield successful TIL growth demonstrated PTEN loss, which was more frequent than was observed in tumors that yielded successful TIL growth (11%). We further validated the association between reduced number and impaired function of TIL with PTEN loss using another independent cohort, TCGA dataset for SKCM. More importantly, we analyzed clinical outcomes of metastatic melanoma patients treated with the FDA-approved anti-PD-1 antibodies. Our analysis demonstrates that a greater reduction in tumor burden was achieved by PD-1 blockade in PTEN present patients, when compared with PTEN absent patients.To decipher the factors mediating the immunosuppressive effects of PTEN loss, we determined the expression profiles of tumor cells with or without PTEN expression. Our results indicated that PTEN loss increased the production of immunosuppressive factors, including CCL2 and VEGF. Anti-VEGF blocking antibody improved anti-tumor activity of transferred tumor-reactive T cells and enhanced tumor infiltration of transferred T cells in PTEN-silenced tumors. These results suggest that loss of PTEN can facilitate the resistance of T cell-mediated immune responses by increasing the expression of immunosuppressive factors.Given that PTEN loss results in activation of the PI3K pathway, we evaluated the efficacy of immunotherapy in combination with a selective PI3Kinhibitor to treat spontaneously developed BRAF mutant, PTEN null melanomas in genetically engineered mouse models. Our result showed that the combination of PI3K inhibitor and anti-PD-1 significantly delayed tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Mice treated with this combination had a median survival time of 28 days, which is longer than the survival time of mice treated with either therapy. Increased numbers of T cells at tumor sites were found in mice receiving the combination therapy compared with mice receiving either agent alone.Taken together, our results demonstrate that PTEN loss contributes to the generation of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Notably, this study provides the first direct clinical evidence to support the association between PTEN loss and poor clinical outcome in immunotherapy treated patients. In addition, our study indicates that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway can improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer.']",

        "Background":"['The fact that melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, is driven by multiple combinations of genetic lesions has supported the use of genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models in validating the etiological and biological roles of oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Most of the currently studied mouse melanoma models are driven by RAS/RAF/MAPK activation via activating RAS or RAF mutations in combination with loss of INK4A/ARF or PTEN; therefore, BRAF/NRAS wild-type melanoma remains less well characterized and the overall survival of patients with metastatic BRAF/NRAS wild-type melanoma remains poor.In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that NEDD9 could synergize with the loss of PTEN and INK4A/ARF in melanoma tumorigenesis. This hypothesis is based on our observation of an inverse correlation between PTEN expression and levels of NEDD9 gene expression in human melanoma samples. NEDD9 (neural precursor derived, developmentally downregulated gene 9) was previously identified by us as a target of a recurrent focal amplification, associated with acquisition of metastatic potential in the RAS-Ink/Arf model. We have shown that NEDD9 is up-regulated in 3550% of metastatic melanomas and enhances proliferation and invasion. First, we demonstrated that NEDD9 cooperated with PTEN loss in Ink4a/Arf-/- melanocytes to enhance cell proliferation, anchorage independent growth, and invasion in vitro. Additionally, when melanocytes were injected into nude mice either subcutaneously or intravenously, NEDD9 overexpression facilitated increased tumor growth and lung seeding, respectively. Further analysis showed that NEDD9 expression correlated with increased phosphorylation of ERK, SFKs (Src family kinases), AKT2, and STAT3. Of these pathways we have demonstrated through the use of small molecule inhibitors that both ERK and AKT2 signaling are required for the enhanced anchorage independent growth observed in NEDD9 overexpressing melanocytes. In addition, we generated a mouse model based on loss of PTEN and INK4A/ARF with or without NEDD9 upregulation. To do this, we generated a tet-inducible NEDD9 allele that carries a doxycycline-responsive, melanocyte-targeted NEDD9. These mice were crossed with a strain containing floxed PTEN and INK4A/ARF in combination with a melanocyte-targeted CreERT2. The development of cutaneous and ocular melanomas in these mice was enhanced by NEDD9 induction.

The goal of this study is to examine whether rare germline sequence variants and/or copy number variations (CNVs) in these genes may influence melanoma risk in melanoma-prone families without known CDKN2A/CDK4 mutations. Methods', \" We conducted exome sequencing in blood-derived DNA in 75 melanoma cases from 23 American melanoma families with 3 affected members.

        "Background":"['Arf6 is a member of the Ras-superfamily of small GTPases and controls membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal remodeling, functioning mainly in endocytosis pathways at the cell periphery. Arf6 is activated by various extracellular signals and oncogenic events and has been shown to promote cell migration and pro-invasive phenotype in human cancer cells. Small molecule inhibition of ARF6 reduces spontaneous metastasis in xenograft models of human cutaneous melanoma, suggesting that ARF6 is necessary for disease progression. Using a genetically-engineered mouse model of BRAF-mutant melanoma, we determined whether activation of Arf6 is sufficient to induce spontaneous metastasis in vivo. For melanocyte-specific primary tumor induction, Cre recombinase was delivered via local injection of RCAS virus into DCT-TVA;Cdkn2alox/lox;BRAFV600E mice. In the experimental mice, a constitutively active mutant form of Arf6 (Q67L) was virally delivered with Cre. In this study, we observed a significant increase in spontaneous metastatic disease burden in Arf6 Q67L mice. Likewise, tail vein injection of melanoma cell lines derived from Arf6 Q67L tumors consistently show a diffuse pattern of pulmonary metastasis compared to controls that show rare, microscopic metastasis. Recently, it has been demonstrated that activation of Akt, but not Pten loss, leads to an aggressive phenotype in melanoma that includes the acquisition of brain metastases. Immunohistochemical analysis of phospho-Akt revealed that Arf6 Q67L is sufficient to induce Akt activation in tumors. In addition, ARF6 is necessary for AKT activation in human melanoma lines. We did not observe brain metastasis in DCT-TVA;Cdkn2alox/lox;BRAFV600E + Arf6 Q67L mice. When we added Ptenlox/lox allele to this genetic background, however, we observed microscopic brain metastases at a low frequency, suggesting that the combination of Pten loss and Arf6 activation reaches a threshold level of Akt activation that is sufficient to cause brain metastasis. Taken together our data indicate that activation of Arf6 is sufficient to potentiate melanoma metastasis, consistent with the proinvasive cellular phenotype attributed to Arf6. In addition, our data suggests a novel signaling mechanism by which Arf6, a small GTPase involved in trafficking, is somehow involved in Akt activation and that this step may be important for the acquisition of metastatic capacity.']",

Defining the landscape of genetic alterations that participate in cancer transformation provides insight into the diversity of clinical responses observed to targeted treatments. Here, we identified concurrent mutational inactivation of the tumor suppressors TP53 and PTEN as a mechanism of resistance to BRAF inhibitors in melanomas harboring mutant V600EBRAF.Defects in TP53 function and PTEN loss occur in 17% and 12% of malignant melanomas respectively, rendering cells dependent on CHK1 to maintain normal cell cycle progression.

        "Background":"['Despite recent success of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib in the clinic, nearly all of those treated follow a course in which initial tumor regression was followed by eventual relapse, which constitutes a major barrier to long-term therapeutic management of melanoma. We have identified a novel mechanism of microenvironment-mediated drug resistance that arises from the release of TGF from melanomas that lack PTEN expression leading to the recruitment of host fibroblasts and the generation of a protective microenvironment through autocrine and paracrine fibronectin secretion facilitating therapeutic escape. Preliminary studies show that BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cell lines that lacked PTEN expression dramatically increased their secretion of TGF- following vemurafenib treatment, as detected by western blot, immunofluorescence and ELISA assays. Furthermore, autocrine TGF secretion initiated with vemurafinib treatment stimulated the upregulation and secretion of fibronectin in PTEN- cells. The vemurafenib-mediated ECM remodeling in this case was dependent upon autocrine TGF signaling and could be attenuated following pre-treatment with the TGF receptor kinase inhibitor SB505124 or by siRNA knockdown of TGF receptor I. A mass spectrometry based phospho-proteomic screen in conjunction with innovative network modeling approaches suggested that increased integrin 51 signaling was a key adaptive response of PTEN- melanoma cells to BRAF inhibitor therapy. The importance of increased fibronectin expression and integrin 51 signaling in the therapeutic escape of PTEN- melanoma cells was confirmed by the significant increases in vemurafenib-induced apoptosis observed following siRNA knockdown of either integrin 5, 1, or fibronectin expression. A mass spectrometry screen (LC-MRM) of 18 BH3 proteins demonstrated Mcl-1 and Bak to be critical apoptosis regulators in the microenvironment-mediated drug resistance response. The importance of PTEN loss and Mcl-1 downregulation in therapeutic escape was validated in PTEN- melanoma cell lines expressing doxycycline inducible forms of PTEN, lipid phosphatase mutant PTEN and Mcl-1. Novel organotypic co-culture models were developed to demonstrate that TGF- released from PTEN- melanoma cell lines activated host fibroblasts leading to the attenuation of drug response in the tumor cells. Our overall hypothesis is that BRAF inhibition remodels both the melanoma and host microenvironments to provide a protective sanctuary for the minor populations of melanoma cells that escape therapy. We postulate that tumor eradication can only be achieved by a dual therapeutic strategy that targets both the bulk tumor and the microenvironment.']",

In this study, we investigated changes in theranostic biomarkers that may be important for MM, which may provide insight into new therapeutic strategies.   Methods', '  1,369 cutaneous melanoma cases referred to Caris Life Sciences between 2009 and 2013 were evaluated.

Thus, there is a need for improved understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and more effective targeted therapies for this devastating disease. The recent work of The Cancer Genome Atlas Network has defined melanoma as an RTK/RAS-driven solid tumor that can be classified into four genomic subtypes', ' BRAF-mutant, RAS-mutant, NF1-mutant, and triple-wild-type. This landmark study highlighted the important role of the previously understudied NF1 tumor suppressor in melanoma pathogenesis, especially for the 9% of melanoma patients who have acquired inactivating NF1-mutations, but lack hotspot mutations that activate BRAF or RAS. To date, animal models have not been developed for the NF1-mutant subtype of melanoma, which has significantly impaired the development of novel therapeutic strategies for this subtype. Here we report the first zebrafish model for NF1-mutant melanoma, which we generated by combining the loss of nf1 with loss of both pten and p53. The resultant compound mutant zebrafish develop aggressive melanomas from the age of 7 weeks and the tumor penetrance is 80% by the age of 18 weeks. We demonstrate further that these high-risk zebrafish melanomas were exclusive of hotspot mutations of braf and nras. Sustained inhibition of both MEK and PI3K suppressed tumor progression in vivo, whereas inhibition of MEK or PI3K alone was insufficient to suppress the growth of these tumors. Surprisingly, single agent therapy with rapamycin, an MTOR inhibitor, proved even better for short- and long-term suppression of tumor cell growth in nf1/pten-mutant melanomas.

Although tumors in patients frequently shrink significantly within weeks of initiation of treatment, resistance eventually develops in many patients, with a median progression free survival of approximately 7 months. Evaluation of the biomarker and phenotypic correlates of response are difficult to determine as paired pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsies generally only represent one on-treatment time point when available. A better in vivo understanding of the effects of BRAF inhibitor-treatment of relevant mouse models may yield insights into the nature of the clinical response and subsequent relapse. The conditional BRAF/PTEN mouse model of melanoma that we co-developed is ideal to study this process. In this non-xenograft model, expression of BRAF V600E and loss of PTEN is under control of the Cre-Lox recombination system.

The Cre recombinase is fused to an estrogen receptor that inhibits the activity of the recombinase. Activation of the Cre recombinase requires topical application of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, allowing for induction of recombination at specific time points in the life span of the mouse.

Most tumor datasets such as The Cancer Genome Atlas focus on unperturbed samples, and subsequently, the statistical frameworks that analyze them.We hypothesized that perturbation of cells can uncover network structures that are undetectable in basal state, and reveal the complexity of cancer cells. To demonstrate this, we generated gene expression data from a panel of melanoma cell lines before and after inhibition of MEK or AKT.Here we present a new computational framework to analyze gene expression data before and after perturbations. The algorithm aims to define differential networks1 - rewiring of network components in different tumors. The algorithm sheds light on the complex and context-specific nature of network structure, including pathways that are activated, or under the control of MAPK or AKT, only in a subset of samples.The perturbation data allowed us to assess pathway activation levels that are undetectable in unperturbed state. For example, AKT is activated in melanoma by PTEN loss, but the effect of NRAS mutation on AKT is unknown, and AKT activation is undetectable in unperturbed cells. Our algorithm identified an AKT activation signature in perturbed state, and helped define the effects of PTEN and NRAS mutations on the pathway. Additionally, the algorithm inferred the genetic status of p53 in each cell line by identifying pathway activation, changes that are, once again, detectable only after perturbations.By linking protein data with the algorithm's results, we identified cell lines with constitutive activation of the STAT3 pathway, and demonstrated the crosstalk between MAPK and STAT3 pathways.Moreover, combining the results from the algorithm with known signatures of drug-sensitivity accurately predicted which drug combinations provided a synergistic effect in each cell line. Associations between pathway activity level and drug sensitivity are known for some drugs. By using our algorithm's ability to infer pathway status in different tumors and to detect changes in those pathways after drug treatment, it correctly predicted when drug treatment sensitized cells to the effects of chemotherapy and other drugs.To conclude, we show that gene expression of perturbed cells greatly enhances the power of network structure analysis. Our results reveal context-specific changes in network structure, and predict which cell lines are sensitized to specific drugs by pathway perturbations.

Recent data suggest that PTEN phosphatase activity may be required for inhibiting cell migration; however, little in vivo experimental evidence exists directly demonstrating the efficacy of PTEN phosphatase in tumor metastasis. We showed here that PTEN loss was correlated with progression to metastatic state using tissue array analysis and UV-irradiated HGF/SF transgenic-PTEN deficient mouse melanoma model. Analysis of various human melanoma cell lines demonstrated that PTEN expression was related to metastatic behavior. To further dissect the role of PTEN activity in metastasis, we have established a model system containing mutant PTEN with various phosphatase activities. We found that wild type PTEN could inhibit cell motility and invasiveness. Moreover, wild type PTEN was able to reduce metastatic potential of melanoma cells in a dose-dependent manner; in contrast, PTEN phosphatase dead mutant promoted metastatic behavior of melanoma cell. To gain more insight into the regulation of tumor cell migration, invasion and metastasis by PTEN, we performed a microarray analysis of cells with various PTEN phosphatase mutants. We found that a protein N-glycosylation and folding promoter, Entpd5 was negatively regulated by PTEN phosphatase. Down regulation of Entpd5 by shRNA in cells with PTEN phosphatase dead mutant blocked PTEN phosphatase dead mutant mediated tumor metastasis in vivo, promoted cell ER stress and growth inhibition as well as reduction of IGF1R. In contrast, overexpression of Entpd5 in cell with PTEN wild-type form enhanced PTEN wild-type-inhibited tumor metastasis in vivo, inhibited cell ER stress, promoted cell growth and abundance of IGF1R.

Here we hypothesize that PTEN status critically modulates the growth inhibitory activity of single and combined MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition. Methods. Molecular and functional effects of single and combined MEK (trametinib, T) and mTOR (everolimus, E) blockade were assessed in a panel of 29 cancer cell lines with different molecular drivers. Pharmacologic interactions were analyzed by conservative isobologram analysis. PTEN role was mechanistically assessed by either silencing PTEN expression by shRNA or overexpressing a functional PTEN protein by stable transfection. Specific proteins and their phosphorylation states were analyzed using Kinexus Antibody Microarrays. Results. In the cell line panel analyzed, the presence of a wt-PTEN was the only significant predictor of sensitivity to T (p=0.001), while BRAF mutations were significantly related to E resistance (p=0.015). PTEN silencing slightly increased resistance to T in the wt-PTEN melanoma cell line M14; conversely, wt-PTEN overexpression in the PTEN-del WM115 cell line, dramatically increased sensitivity to T. E-induced growth inhibition was not significantly affected. Combined MEK and mTOR inhibition resulted in a striking growth inhibitory synergism in cells lacking PTEN expression (CI', ' 0.4-0.0005), but not in those with an intact PTEN (CI', ' 1.2-107; p=0.001).

Similar results in terms of synergistic/antagonistic pharmacologic interactions were obtained when either double PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitors (PF-5212384) or AKT allosteric inhibitors (MK-2206) were used to block the PI3K/mTOR pathway in combination with T. Proteomic analysis indicated that a greater modification of protein expression/phosphorylation profiles in response to MEK or combined MEK/mTOR inhibition occurs in cells lacking a functional PTEN, as compared to the wt-PTEN-expressing ones; preliminary analysis suggests that AKT phosphorylation and NF-B activation maybe be crucial mediators of synergistic growth-inhibitory interactions occurring with combined treatment.

In particular, the MAPK and the PI3K/AKT pathways have been found to both reduce response rates to these agents and to mediate the acquisition of resistance via mutations that activate both pathways. For example, two recently approved BRAFV600E inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, cause dramatic clinical responses in 50% of BRAFV600E + melanoma patients but universally become ineffective within 5-6 months as a result of genetic alterations that activate the MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, including amplifications in BRAFV600E, loss of PTEN, and activating mutations in NRAS and KRAS, MEK, AKT1/3, PIK3CA and PIK3CG. Several of these mutated signaling proteins stimulate glucose metabolism, required for survival and proliferation, in part by increasing the expression and activity of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFKFB3). For example, PFKFB3 transcription is induced by HIF-1 (which is increased by BRAFV600E, RAS and MEK), loss of PTEN, and PFKFB3 activity is stimulated by AKT via phosphorylation of serine 461. We postulated that PFKFB3 is an essential downstream target of targeted cancer therapies and that the multitude of mutations and amplifications in signaling pathways that cause resistance to these agents activate PFKFB3. In new studies, we demonstrate that BRAFV600E, estradiol and epidermal growth factor each regulate PFKFB3 expression in melanoma cells, breast cancer cells and NSCLC cells, respectively. Moreover, we find that simultaneous inhibition of these oncoproteins or their co-ligands (i.e. the estrogen and EGF receptors) and PFKFB3 using a novel PFKFB3 inhibitor currently in a phase 1 trial, PFK-158, causes a synergistic increase in apoptosis and cytotoxicity in vitro, suggesting that PFK-158 can overcome the intrinsic resistance to these agents. We then decided to determine if these significant synergies would translate in vivo by investigating them in the A375 and A2058 melanoma preclinical models, and in the MCF-7 ER-dependent breast model. For instance, we compared the anti-tumor effects in A375 melanoma xenograft-bearing mice of', ' (i) the BRAFV600E inhibitor vemurafenib; (ii) PFK-158; or (iii) the combination of vemurafenib and PFK-158.

Results in these different models will be presented. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the PFKFB3 inhibitor PFK-158 may be able to universally overcome resistance to targeted cancer therapies. Furthermore, we predict that phase 1/2 trials of PFK-158 in combination with targeted cancer agents will yield improvements in objective response rates as well as improvements in progression-free survival.']",

        "Background":"['In human cancers, loss of PTEN, stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor-1, and activation of Ras and AKT converge to increase the activity of a regulator of glycolysis, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB3). This enzyme synthesizes fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which is an activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase, a key step of glycolysis that is tightly controlled by multiple metabolic feedback mechanisms. We recently identified the first competitive small molecule inhibitor of PFKFB3, 3-(3-pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one (3PO), and demonstrated that this agent is selectively cytotoxic to Ras-transformed epithelial cells and displays broad anti-tumor activity. We now report the discovery of a novel 3PO-derivative, PFK158, that is markedly more potent than 3PO, has excellent pharmacokinetic properties and causes 80% growth inhibition in several mouse models of human-derived tumors. Importantly, IND-enabling safety and toxicity studies have demonstrated that PFK158 is well tolerated in rats and dogs, providing support for a phase 1 trial in cancer patients planned for early 2014. Once the maximum tolerated dose is identified, we intend to conduct multiple phase 1/2 trials of PFK158 in combination with targeted agents given the ability of PFK158 to suppress glucose metabolism and multiple survival mechanisms. One such targeted agent, vemurafenib, is a mutant B-Raf inhibitor that was recently FDA-approved for BRAFV600E-positive melanoma patients. Unfortunately, a multitude of resistance mechanisms have resulted in disease progression in less than one year for the majority of melanoma patients treated with vemurafenib. We hypothesized that PFK158 would sensitize vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells and found that the addition of PFK158 to vemurafenib caused a marked increase in the apoptotic death of several melanoma cell lines in vitro. These data provide rationale for the conduct of pre-clinical studies of PFK158 combined with vemurafenib in transgenic BRAFV600E melanoma mouse models which are in turn expected to justify a phase I/II trial of the combination in BRAFV600E-positive melanoma patients. In conclusion, PFK158 is the first PFKFB3 inhibitor to be examined in a phase I trial and may have significant clinical utility when combined with agents that target driver oncogenes.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Furin is required for processing KISS1 to kisspeptins.",
        "Background":"['KISS1 is a broadly functional metastatic suppressor that is secreted and processed in the extracellular milieu into small peptides (called kisspeptins (KP)). The enzyme(s) responsible for generation of KP from nascent KISS1 is unknown, although sequence analysis (cleavage at KR or RR dibasic sites) suggests that members of the proprotein convertase family may be involved. We, therefore, hypothesized that enzyme(s) belonging to the proprotein convertase family process KISS1 to generate kisspeptins. To this end, we treated multiple melanomas and breast carcinoma cells overexpressing KISS1 with the proprotein convertase inhibitor Dec-RVKR-CMK and found that KISS1 processing was completely inhibited, strongly consistent with a role for proprotein convertases. To identify specific proprotein convertases responsible for KISS1 processing, we systematically analyzed the mRNA expression of the nine members of this family across numerous cell lines. We found a consistent expression of the three proteases - furin, PC5 and PC7 -suggesting one or combination of these three enzymes to be involved in KISS1 processing. shRNA-mediated knockdown of furin, PC5 and PC7 (individually and in combination) resulted in complete loss of KISS1 processing only in furin knockdown cells; whereas, no effect on processing was observed in PC5 or PC7 knockdown cells. Thus, when combined with previous studies showing post-secretion processing, extracellular furin was identified as the essential enzyme responsible for KISS1 proteolytic cleavage into kisspeptins.

        "Background":"['BACKGROUND', ' BRAF/MEK inhibitors have shown promising levels of response in melanomas harboring the BRAF V600E mutation, however responses tend to be short-lived and resistance is a major clinical problem. In the current study, we evaluated the pharmacological activity of BI847325, a dual inhibitor of MEK and Aurora kinases against multiple melanoma cell line models.METHODS', ' The cytotoxic effect of BI847325 was evaluated in vitro in a panel of selected BRAF-mutant vemurafenib resistant cell lines by Alamar blue and Annexin V binding assay. 3D spheroid model systems and colony formation assays demonstrated the long-term growth inhibitory effect of BI847325. Western blot analysis and qRT-PCR studies were carried out to evaluate the mechanism underlying BI5-mediated cytotoxicity. In vivo studies in Balb SCID mice were performed to assess the suppression of BRAF-mutant xenografts on treatment with BI847325.RESULTS', ' BI847325 potently reduced the growth and survival of BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines with acquired and intrinsic BRAF inhibitor resistance (NRAS mutations, BRAF splice forms, Cyclin D1 amplification, RTK upregulation, PTEN loss, COT amplification). We confirmed that BI847325 induced apoptosis through decrease in Mcl-1 mRNA and protein expression and increase in BIM expression. The effects of BI847325 upon BIM and Mcl-1 expression could not be mimicked by the combination of other MEK and aurora kinase inhibitors. For the first time we demonstrated that BI847325 reverses the acquired vemurafenib resistance by inhibiting MEK expression at mRNA and protein level. A strong suppression of MEK expression was observed without recovery following 72 h of washout. In vivo studies revealed complete tumor suppression with no recurrence over a period of 65 days of treatment with 70mg/kg/week dose of BI847325. In contrast, treatment with vemurafenib analog PLX4720 in the same mouse model was associated with tumor relapse after 30 days of treatment. BI847325 also successfully suppressed the long-term growth of xenografts with acquired vemurafenib resistance. Analysis of tumor samples complied with in vitro results demonstrating inhibition of phospho-ERK, phospho-Histone3, Mcl-1 and total MEK.CONCLUSION', ' In conclusion we report for the first time that BI847325, a novel ATP-competitive MEK/ Aurora kinase inhibitor effectively inhibits BRAF-mutant melanoma and overcomes vemurafenib-resistance by decreasing expression of MEK and Mcl-1; in vitro and in vivo. Further preclinical and clinical investigations towards this would open new avenues in treatment of melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['The RAS-RAF-MEK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways are two major signaling pathways involved in human cancer. Components of these two pathways are frequently mutated in a wide variety of solid tumors. Concurrent double mutations in the two pathways are also observed quite often in a broad range of tumor types. Additionally, inhibition of one of these pathways often leads to the upregulation of the other pathway and development of resistance. In preclinical models, combined inhibition of both pathways has been shown to impart greater efficacy as compared to inhibition of either pathway alone. ASN003 is a novel, highly selective, small-molecule inhibitor of both RAS-RAF and PI3K pathways, discovered using a rational design approach. ASN003 shows potent inhibitory activity against B-RAF and PI3K kinases (low nM IC50). Within the PI3K family, ASN003 has high selectivity for inhibition of PI3Kα and PI3Kδ over PI3Kβ. In a panel of 292 kinases, ASN003 showed high selectivity for inhibiting B-RAF and PI3 kinases, and associated mutant kinases. In cell-based mechanistic studies, ASN003 inhibited phosphorylation of ERK, AKT and S6, and showed strong antiproliferative activity (IC50 = 60-300 nM) in cell lines with B-RAF and PI3K pathway mutations as well as in vemurafenib-resistant cell lines. In pharmacodynamic studies in multiple tumor models, ASN003 showed strong inhibition of the phosphorylation of downstream targets of B-RAF and PI3K, confirming appropriate target engagement. In in vivo efficacy studies, ASN003 showed strong tumor growth inhibition or regression in multiple tumor xenograft models, including A375 (B-Raf V600E mutation), RKO (B-Raf V600E and PIK3CA mutations), and A2058 (B-Raf V600E mutation and PTEN loss). We now report that ASN003 also showed strong tumor growth inhibition (>80%) in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model established from a relapsed patient with progressive B-Raf mutant melanoma who showed initial response to vemurafenib. Sequencing analysis showed that the vemurafenib resistant tumor acquired a concurrent PIK3CA mutation. Dual targeting of the B-RAF and PI3K pathways with ASN003 has the potential to treat and/or prevent the acquired resistance to selective B-RAF inhibitors, and may also treat a broader patient population and provide greater efficacy and survival benefit than selective B-RAF inhibitors or selective PI3K pathway inhibitors alone. ASN003 is currently in Phase I clinical development in patients with advanced solid tumors, including tumors with B-Raf V600 mutation, PI3 kinase pathway alterations or PTEN loss.']",

        "Background":"['PHLDA1 (pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A, member 1) has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor gene in multiple cancers such as melanoma and breast cancer but appears to contribute to intestinal tumorigenesis. PHLDA2 is located in a cluster of imprinted genes on chromosome 11p15.5, an important tumor suppressor gene region. Alterations in this region may be associated with multiple cancers. Loss of imprinting of PHLDA2 was found to mediate placental growth retardation. The pleckstrin homology-like domain (PH domain) mediates protein recruitment to cellular membranes, which is of paramount importance for signal transduction. AKT and ERK are important protein kinases that play key roles in multiple cellular processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, transcription and cell migration. Activation and phosphorylation of AKT require binding to PIP through its PH domain. Another family member, PHLDA3 recently has been reported to be a major negative regulator of AKT signaling analogous to PTEN and it was shown that it functions as a negative AKT regulator by the quenching of membrane-bound phosphatidyl-inositol molecules. In our microarray studies of oncogenic EGFR and ErbB2 signaling using erlotinib-treated HCC827, CL-387,785-treated H1975 as well as lapatinib-treated Calu-3 and SKBR-3 cells, PHLDA1 and PHLDA2 were consistently identified as immediately downregulated genes upon oncogenic HER signaling inhibition and this was confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR as well as Western blotting studies. The regulation of PHLDA1/2 by HER signaling inhibition has not been investigated in detail previously. Our results show that the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 significantly induces PHLDA1 expression but inhibits PHLDA2 expression in a time-dependent manner. Transient transfection mediated PHLDA1 over-expression in SKBR3 inhibited AKT activation and siRNA-mediated suppression of PHLDA2 in Calu3 cells dramatically induced ERK activation. Stable transfection mediated PHLDA1 over-expression in breast cancer cells inhibited both anchorage-dependent and independent cell growth in vitro. MTS cell proliferation studies showed that siRNA mediated suppression of PHLDA2 stimulated Calu3 cell growth. Studies are ongoing to test the potential role of PHLDA1/2 on inhibiting the direct activation of AKT by detailed PIP3 quantification studies. Our results provide strong evidence that PHLDA1/2 are downstream targets of HER2 signaling and suggest complex regulation of PHLDA1 and 2 by ERK and PI3K pathways. Our studies also suggest significant growth inhibitory effects for PHLDA1/2 and suggest that they might potentially act competitively with AKT and ERK to perform tumor suppression function. Our studies identify PHLDA1/2 as novel targets for therapeutic modulation in EGFR and ErbB2-driven cancers.']",

Loss of PTEN and/or PI 3K mutations have been associated with enhanced susceptibility to PX-866. PX-866 is being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial to determine the MTD, and measure safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints in PBMCs and tumor tissue in patients with solid tumors. Methods', ' Patients with advanced metastatic cancers receive PX-866 orally once daily for 5 of 7 days for 2 weeks in a 28-day cycle. Dose levels of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4.5, 6, 8, and 10 mg are planned. PK and PD samples are collected days 1, 2, 5, 8, 12, and 15 of cycle one and days 1 and 12 of cycle two. A PD assay has been developed that utilizes flow cytometry to test the inhibition of S6RP and mTOR in PBMC. Once the MTD of this PX-866 schedule of administration has been identified, an expansion cohort is planned to investigate tumor PD events and correlate tumor and PBMC endpoints with efficacy. Results', ' Four cohorts (0.5, 1, 2, 3 mg) comprising 12 patients (age 42-74, median PS 1) have completed accrual, with the 4.5 mg cohort actively enrolling. The total number of cycles to date is 30 (median 2, range 1-5+). Abdominal discomfort and mild diarrhea have been possibly associated with PX-866. No drug-related severe adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities have occurred. Of the 6 patients treated in the first 2 cohorts, 3 previously progressing patients had stable disease (SD) as best response and were on study for 105, 147 and 162+ (still active) days. Two patients (squamous cell skin cancer and melanoma) had decrease in pain allowing discontinuation of analgesics. Proof-of-concept PD studies in PBMCs evidenced a dose dependent inhibition of both p-S6RP and p-mTOR levels. Conclusions', ' PX-866 is a novel oral PI-3K inhibitor that is undergoing development in a clinical trial with built-in PD endpoints. PX-866 has shown to have a mild side effect profile while inducing stabilization of disease in previously progressing cancer patients. Oral PX-866 provides target inhibition even at low drug doses and inhibition is maintained for an extended time following the last dose. Updated clinical, PK and PD results will be presented.']",

        "Meeting_name":" A cellular model of acquired resistance to rilotumumab (AMG 102) in glioblastoma.",
        "Background":"['Acquired drug resistance is a long-standing problem of cancer therapeutics. The issue has become even more vexing with the development of highly selective agents; resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib is acquired frequently in lung adenocarcinomas. Thus, anticipating acquired resistance and understanding its basis may help us develop strategies to prevent or circumvent occurrence. Through its receptor tyrosine kinase Met, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) regulates mitogenesis, motogenesis, and morphogenesis during development and adulthood. HGF/Met signaling also contributes to cancer progression in many malignancies, including glioblastoma. Rilotumumab is a fully human neutralizing monoclonal antibody against HGF tested in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials, including mono therapy in renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma, as well as combination trials in gastric, colorectal, small cell lung cancers and castrate resistant prostate cancer.To generate a cellular model of acquired resistance to rilotumumab, an HGF/Met dependent human glioblastoma-derived cell line (U87-MG) was grown in rilotumumab (600 nM) for 120 days. Growth rate, HGF secretion, Met content and Met activation state were 10-fold, 10,000-fold, 10-fold and 80-fold higher than the parental cell values, respectively. The HGF and MET coding sequences were normal in both parental and resistant cells. Quantitative PCR studies to determine mRNA levels of all HGF isoforms revealed a dramatic increase in full-length HGF transcript. CGH array studies indicated amplification within both HGF and MET genes. Xenograft studies confirmed that tumor growth was resistant to rilotumumab, however the resistant cell line and tumors remained sensitive to a highly selective Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suggesting that resistance was achieved via increased HGF/Met signaling rather than mutation or activation of alternate pathways. Microarray expression analysis demonstrated transcript profiles that were consistent with HGF/Met pathway activation. Thus the molecular basis of acquired resistance in this model differs from those prevalent in', ' [1] lung cancers treated with EGFR inhibitors and medulloblastomas treated with hedgehog inhibitors, where most cases acquire secondary mutations in the targeted kinase; [2] breast cancers treated with HER2 inhibitors, where PTEN loss, p27 downregulation, and activation of other receptors are primary causes; or [3] malignant melanoma treated with BRAF inhibitors, where increased signaling via multiple pathways lead to PI3K- and/or MEK-mediated reactivation of the MAPK pathway. In addition to the importance of HGF/Met pathway activity in selecting glioblastoma patients for HGF-targeted therapeutics, our results suggest that monitoring Met pathway activity could provide early indications of acquired resistance to these agents, and that Met kinase inhibitors may still be efficacious when resistance occurs.']",

The current use of large panels of human cancer cell lines (i.e. NCI60, GDSC) with associated phenotypic and genotypic information allows for informatics approaches and in silico screens to rapidly test hypotheses based on simple as well as complex relationships. We have assembled a panel of canine cancer cell lines to facilitate translational studies in canine cancer and report here the characteristics and some applications of this panel in comparative oncology.Methods', ' Canine cancer cell lines isolated from tumors have been accumulated from a number of sources over the years.

Drug sensitivity analysis was carried out using a resazurin-based bioreductive fluorometric assay. Gene expression microarray analysis was carried out using the Affymetrix GeneChip Canine 2.0 at the Genomics and Microarray Core (University of Colorado Cancer Center).Results', ' Drug sensitivity to the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, lomustine, paclitaxel and vinblastine were assessed and compared to responses in the human NCI-60 panel. Results show that the human and canine cell lines show similar ranges of sensitivity to these agents. The mean GI50 values for the human and canine cell lines are significantly different for DOX, VBL, CARBO, CCNU as well as PTX. The variances in the data were also significantly different for CARBO and PTX. Overall, however, the drug sensitivity/resistance patterns in the canine and human tumor cell line panels shared general trends with regard to sensitivity and variance observed to the specific agents with the mean Log GI50 values for each agent showing a cross-species correlation (r = 0.88, p = 0.0194, Pearson). Cluster analysis of the gene expression data using the top 100 most variant genes as well as the 100 top most variant cancer genes largely separates the panel into groups with similar histiotypes. Cluster analysis of cancer genes also highlights alterations in gene expression that may contribute to pathogenesis in some cell lines such as loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor or elevated expression of receptor tyrosine kinase genes.Conclusions', ' The FACC canine tumor cell line panel represents a validated panel of representative cancers from dogs that can be utilized for comparative oncology studies as well as applications in drug development where use of a companion animal model is appropriate.']",
