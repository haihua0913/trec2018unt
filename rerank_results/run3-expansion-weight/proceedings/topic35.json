        "Background":"['Background', ' Germline mutations in CDKN2A have been known to increase the risk of melanoma and pancreatic cancer compared to the general population. With the advent of multi-gene panels, individuals who may not have melanoma or pancreatic cancer are undergoing CDKN2A analysis. Previous studies in homogenous populations have suggested that breast cancer risks may also be increased in CDKN2A. This study aims to further evaluate a possible relationship of CDKN2A mutations with breast cancer through a series of case-control comparisons. Methods', ' Clinical histories and molecular results were retrospectively reviewed for patients undergoing CDKN2A analysis as part of two diagnostic pan-cancer panels at a single laboratory to ascertain CDKN2A mutation carriers (n = 104) and patients negative for all genes analyzed (n = 20,280). Patients with a personal and/or family history (1st and 2nd degree relatives) of pancreatic cancer and/or melanoma were excluded from case-control analysis. Results', ' The majority of CDKN2A mutation carriers (82.6%, n = 86/104) had a personal history of cancer documented on the test requisition form. The most common cancers were breast (n = 38, 52.8%), melanoma (n = 37, 43.0%) and pancreatic (n = 6, 7.1%). The average age of breast cancer diagnosis in this cohort was 49.3 years (range 25-84). Family history of breast, melanoma, and/or pancreatic cancer was reported for 54.9%, 46.1%, and 34.3% of CDKN2A mutation carriers, respectively. Females with breast cancer were not more likely to test positive for a CDKN2A mutation than females with cancer other than breast (OR = 0.84, p = 0.79) or unaffected females (OR = 1.02, p = 1). Conclusions', ' Although CDKN2A mutations were not significantly associated with breast cancer in this cohort, these findings do not necessarily rule out an association of CDKN2A mutations with breast cancer, particularly if risks are moderate or if genotype-phenotype correlations exist. Additional studies involving breast cancer cases unselected for age and family history and/or longitudinal studies of CDKN2A carriers are needed to better understand the relationship between CDKN2A and breast cancer risk.']",

        "Meeting_name":" The long non-coding RNA CAI2 is a tumor suppressor gene",
        "Background":"['We have recently reported on the discovery of a long non-coding RNA imbedded in intron 2 of the p16/ARF (CDKN2A) locus at 9p21. CAI2 is a non-conserved, RNA pol II regulated gene with whose expression is highly correlated with parent genes p16 and ARF. However, CAI2 is expressed in cell lines deleted for p16, ARF and even p15, and is expressed cell lines epigenetically silenced for p16 and/or ARF. Furthermore, treatment of p16 and/or ARF epigenetically silenced cell lines with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidin allows p16 and/or ARF re-expression while having no influence on CAI2, confirming independent regulation. Speculating, therefore, that the regulatory region of CAI2 lies imbedded in the non-transcribed portion of intron 2, we created expression constructs of the immediate 5 region of CAI2. However, consistent with a bioinformatical analysis, no regulatory activity was detected. This suggests that this non-coding RNA is non-traditionally controlled by remote but yet to be identified regulatory element(s) and/or mechanisms. By colony formation assay, CAI2 overexpression can inhibit cell growth in the p16 intact HEK293T and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell lines. RNA Immunoprecipitation has revealed that CAI2 interacts with H3K27me3, a recruiter of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) that modulates chromatin structure and gene expression, and BMI1, a PRC1 complex protein that is a negative regulator of p16. Consistent with this effect, CAI2 can induce p16 expression in HEK293T cells, and this was hypothesized to be the mechanism by which CAI2 inhibits cell growth. However, we now show that CAI2 can also inhibit colony formation in the p16/ARF deleted MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Interestingly however, CAI2 overexpression had little to no effect on 2D cultures of HEK293T or MCF7 cells including DNA synthesis, XTT metabolic activity or cell count.As CAI2 is imbedded in the p16/ARF gene, standard siRNAs may inadvertently influence p16 and/or ARF expression due to actions on their pre-mRNAs. Therefore, we created a series of partial CAI2 knockouts using CRISPR technology and compared their growth by colony formation assay. Notably, clones containing a partial knockout of the 5 region of CAI2 proliferated faster than mock transfected clones, consistent with the growth suppressive properties observed with CAI2 overexpression. In 2D cultures, a small increase in DNA synthesis was also observed in the partial deletions. The HEK293T clones containing partial deletions of CAI2 also exhibited small increases in expression of the remaining intact portions of the gene with a concomitant decrease in p16 expression, all consistent with an influence of CAI2 on p16 expression and cell growth; no influence on ARF expression was observed.Taken together, the data demonstrate that CAI2 is capable of influencing p16 expression, but this influence is insufficient to fully account for the ability of CAI2 to regulate growth, and we conclude that CAI2 is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene in its own right.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Regulation of p16Ink4a - Rb pathway by Cyclin D1- Dmp1 interaction",
        "Background":"['Cyclin D1 is a crucial regulator in mammalian cell cycle that binds to and activates CDK4/6, which is an kinase that drives cells to enter S phase. It has an important oncogenic role in breast cancer because the CCND1 gene is amplified in 15% of cases and its protein expression is elevated in up to 50% of cases. Previous studies demonstrate that cyclin D1 overexpression can cause pRb hyper-phosphorylation and therefore induce cell hyperproliferation, which can result in the development of mammary adenocarcinoma. In addition, cyclin D1 is found to contribute to tumorigenesis by affecting the activity of transcriptional factors via physical interaction. One of the affected transcriptional factors is called Dmp1, which acts as a tumor suppressor when receiving oncogenic signals. It activates Arf by binding to its promoter region, therefore causing Arf, p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in normal cells. Our recent study in MMTV-neu mice showed that loss of Dmp1 significantly accelerates mammary carcinogenesis. Although both Dmp1 and cyclin D1 play vital roles in breast cancer prevention and development respectively, the biological functions and significance of Dmp1-cyclin D1 interaction remains to be explored. To identify the impact of their interaction on the activation of p16Ink4a/ p19Arf promoters induced by cyclin D1, MEFs were overexpressed cyclin D1 and we found the endogenous p16Ink4a and p19Arf transcripts were increased up to 7 fold. However, their transcription level was not affected in Dmp1-null MEFs. Moreover, cyclin D1 mutant 142-253 that cannot bind to Dmp1could not fully activate the p16Ink4a/p19Arf promoters, indicating the activation of p16Ink4a/p19Arf promoters by cyclin D1 is dependent on Dmp1, and loss of Dmp1-cyclin D1 interaction will attenuate this effect. To identify the potential regulation of p16Ink4a by Dmp1, we performed EMSA and luciferase reporter assay, and we found that Dmp1 activates the p16Ink4a promoter by directly binding to its promoter. Moreover, the p16Ink4a mRNA and protein level were increased upon Dmp1 overexpression. The above results suggest that Dmp1 is a physiological regulator of p16Ink4a. To explore the effect of Dmp1 on Cdk4 kinase activity, 293T cells were overexpressed cyclin D1 alone or together with Dmp1, and we found there was less cyclin D1 associated with CDK4 after CDK4 immunoprecipitation. As a consequence, pRb phosphorylation was decreased in CDK4 kinase assay. These results suggest that Dmp1 decreases CDK4 kinase activity by impairing cyclin D1-CDK4 interaction. Taken together, our data suggest that Dmp1 decreases pRb phosphorylation in two ways', ' one is to directly bind to and activate p16INK4a, and the other one is to block the CDK4 kinase activity by binding to cyclin D1. In addition, cyclin D1-Dmp1 interaction is indispensible in activation of p16Ink4a/p19Arf promoters induced by cyclin D1.']",

        "Background":"['Obesity, a disease linked to increased number of adipocytes in various tissues, is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for the development of breast cancer. Obesity has been reported to be associated with the occurrence of larger, more advanced tumors and aggressive cancer pathological features, including lymph node metastasis, advanced tumor stage, and high grade. Accumulating recent evidence highlights the tumor-surrounding adipose tissue as a key component of breast cancer progression. However, the molecular basis of adipocyte-related breast carcinogenesis remains elusive. To shed light on this important phenomenon, we investigated the autocrine and paracrine roles of the tumor suppressor p16 INK4A protein in adipocytes. We have found that down-regulation of p16INK4A by specific shRNA in breast adipocytes enhanced their migration/invasion abilities and increased the expression/secretion levels of various adipokines including leptin. In addition, we have shown that p16INK4A protein inhibits the pro-carcinogenic effects of breast stromal adipocytes in vitro and in tumor xenografts through repressing the expression/secretion of Leptin. Indeed, p16INK4A suppresses Leptin at the mRNA level. This effect is mediated trough miR-141 and miR-146b-5p, which inhibits Leptin expression through a specific sequence at the Leptin 3UTR. In addition, we present clear evidence that down-regulation of p16INK4A is sufficient to trans-activate breast stromal adipocytes, which promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition in normal breast luminal cells in a leptin-dependent manner.These results provide the first indication that p16INK4A and miR-141 and miR-146b-5p represses Leptin and its procarcinogenic effects in breast stromal adipocytes.

        "Background":"['In addition to serving crucial roles in bone development, Hedgehog (Hh) signaling contributes to the development and progression of many cancers, making it an attractive candidate for treatment of bone-resident cancers. Recent data suggest that Hh-targeted agents exert pluripotent effects on host bone microenvironment cells through both cell-intrinsic and paracrine mechanisms, interrupting the vicious cycle of tumor cell, osteoblast (OB), osteoclast (OC), and bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) interactions in bone metastatic breast cancers. Here, reciprocal stimulation between tumor cells and bone cells enhance both tumor growth and bone pathology. Similarly, development of osteosarcoma (OS), the most common primary bone cancer, is strongly influenced by conditions within surrounding microenvironment providing additional points for therapeutic intervention.The 5-year survival rate for metastatic OS is under 30%, highlighting the need for novel and targeted treatments. We have demonstrated that mice deficient in the tumor suppressor ARF (p19ARF; p14ARF in humans) have enhanced rates of bone turnover, mimicking the adolescent growth period in which OS is prevalent. By crossing Arf-/- mice with those expressing Tax, an HTLV-1 oncogene that results in osteolytic tumors, we developed a model of high penetrant spontaneous OS that recapitulates many aspects of human disease. Here, suppression of bone turnover with the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid prevented the development of OS, suggesting that enhanced OC activity may stimulate OS growth. In agreement, we found that Tax+Arf-/- OS had increased RANKL-to-OPG ratios resulting in increased osteoclastogenic ability. Compared to normal osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cell precursors, Tax+Arf-/- OS cells have increased expression of Hh pathway genes and exhibit increased susceptibility to Hh inhibitors (SMO antagonists). In particular, Tax+Arf-/- OS cells express high levels of the Hh ligands Sonic (SHH) and Indian (IHH), suggesting they may stimulate surrounding cells in a paracrine fashion. Notably, BMSC derived from non-tumor bearing Tax+Arf-/- mice also exhibit increased expression of pro-tumorigenic factors (including IL-6 and IGF), generating a fertile soil. SHH or conditioned media from Tax+Arf-/- OS cells enhanced OC activity and BMSC cell production of pro-tumorigenic growth factors. Furthermore, the increased OB and OC differentiation and activity present in Tax+Arf-/- cells could be abrogated with SMO inhibitors. We have established an OS cell line from Tax+Arf-/- mice (TAN) with the ability to form mineralized tumors upon intratibial injection. Using this model, we hypothesize that treatment with SMO antagonists will decrease OS growth due to both tumor cytotoxic effects and direct effects on host bone microenvironment cells that abrogate the pro-tumor microenvironment.']",

        "Background":"['The CDKN2A gene is the most common high penetrance susceptibility gene identified to date in melanoma families. While functional tests for determining the pathogenicity of missense germline mutations in the CDKN2A coding region have been developed, rare polymorphisms or sequence variants at the CDKN2A/ p16INK4a 5UTR, encountered during routine screening, are usually defined as variants with unknown significance after determining their frequency in control population and the cosegregation analysis in the family, when possible. We recently developed reporter assays to study a panel of p16INK4a 5UTR variants identified as heterozygous changes in patients from a hospital-based series of melanoma cases (c.-21C>T; c.-25C>T&c.-180G>A; c.-56G>T; c.-67G>C). Monocistronic as well as bicistronic luciferase-based reporter vectors were developed and used to test wild type and variant p16INK4a 5UTR activity upon transient transfection in melanoma-derived cells (WM266-4, G361 and SK-Mel-5) and in the breast cancer-derived MCF7 cells. Results revealed that the c.-21C>T variant had a strong negative impact on the reporter activity, similar to that of the known melanoma-predisposing mutation c.-34G>T, included as a control. The variants at 56 and at 25&-180 exhibited a milder impact, while results with c.-67G>C were dependent on the type of reporter vector. Quantification of the luciferase mRNA conducted in parallel with the luciferase assay indicated that the impact of the variants was mainly post-transcriptional. We also applied a polysomal profiling technique to measure allelic imbalance starting from heterozygous patient-derived cell lines and found that the c.-21C>T variant but also c.-56T>G and c.-67G>C exhibited lower association with the polysomes suggestive of reduced mRNA translation efficiency. A panel of eleven additional germline variants in the 5UTR of p16INK4a is being investigated. In particular we are focusing on the functional interactions between wild type and variant p16INK4a 5- and 3-UTR sequences and on the impact the variants can have on the targeting of the p16INK4a mRNA by microRNAs (including mir-346, -636, -639, -935) or RNA binding proteins (including YB-1).']",

Dysregulation of the cell cycle pathway through activation of cyclin D1 and/or inactivation of CDKN2A is a mechanism of tumor progression in breast cancer and drugs targeting CDK4/6 is undergoing investigation in this disease with promising preliminary results. We investigated several key genetic alterations in cell cycle regulatory proteins in advanced breast cancer patient samples to identify potential targets for cell cycle related treatment options.  Methods', '    A comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on 37 breast cancer samples with the majority being metastatic. Testing included targeted exome sequencing of 562 genes in tumor and paired normal DNA.  Results', '    Patients ages ranged from 27-66 years. Analysis of cell cycle regulatory genes revealed focal amplification of cyclin D1/D2 or CDKN2A loss in 9/37 (24%) of  cases, of which, 45% were hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 negative,  33%  were HR positive, HER2 positive and 22% were triple negative (TNBC) subtype. Loss of RB1 was analyzed since it negatively regulates response to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Loss of RB1 was noted in 4/37 (10.8%) of cases, all of which were TNBCs. Only a single TNBC with RB1 loss had concurrent CDK4 amplification and loss of CDKN2A. No evidence of CCNE1 amplification was found in any samples. Incidence of CDK4 and CDK6 amplification was found in samples with cyclin D1 amplification or CDKN2A loss. Our cohort included a single male TNBC patient who harbored cyclin D1 amplification as well as CDKN2A loss. Overall, amplification of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, CDK4 and CDK6 was found in 16%, 5.4%, 2.7% and 2.7% respectively. Loss of CDKN2A was noted in 5.4% of tumors profiled.  Conclusions', '    Exome sequencing identified subsets of patients with mutated cell cycle associated genes that may benefit from CDK 4/6 inhibitors. Our data suggests loss of RB1 is more frequent in TNBC subtype which may confer resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors.

Twenty-eight patients (10%) were found to have a pathogenic mutation (Class 5 variant) or likely deleterious VUS (Class 4).   Seven of these patients (2.5% overall) were found to have Class 4/5 variants in genes for which clinical guidelines exist for management, namely TP53 (4), CDKN2A (1) and MSH2 (2).

        "Background":"['Obesity, a disease linked to increased number of adipocytes in various tissues, is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for the development of breast cancer. However, the molecular basis of adipocyte-related breast carcinogenesis remains elusive. In this study, we established and characterized normal stromal adipocytes from post-plastic surgery of breast tissues from obese and lean women. We have shown that adipocytes from obese women express low level of the tumor suppressor p16 protein, have higher secretion of various adipokines and higher invasion and migration capabilities as compared to adipocytes from lean women. In addition, down-regulation of p16INK4A by shRNA in adipocytes from lean women increased the expression/secretion levels of various adipokines including leptin, activated breast adipocytes and enhanced their migration/invasion abilities. Consequently, media conditioned with p16-deficient adipocytes or adipocytes from obese women promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition in normal breast luminal cells in a leptin-dependent manner and induced tumor growth in vivo. Indeed, p16INK4A suppresses Leptin at the mRNA level through miR-141 and miR-146b-5p, which inhibits Leptin expression through a specific sequence at the Leptin 3’UTR. These results show the existence of active adipocytes in the mammary gland of obese women in absence of breast cancer cells and provide the first indication that p16INK4A through targeting miR-141 and miR-146b-5p suppresses Leptin and its procarcinogenic effects.

When targeting SHRs for BC therapy, the major challenge is how to increase the selectivity of drugs against SHRs in specific cell/tissue. While estrogen- and progesterone- receptors are well studied in BC, glucocorticoid (GC) as a ubiquitous stress activated steroid hormone is less investigated. However, the elevated GC circadian dynamics is associated with poor prognosis, and GC receptor (GR) is highly expressed in metastatic BC. GCs are used successfully as an adjuvant therapy to induce apoptosis of leukemia and lymphoma. However, when applied to BC, the results are controversial with most GCs showing either pro-survival or no effects. To analyze the underlying mechanisms, gene expression profiling was performed in this study using qRT-PCR array that covers the genes as the drivers of BC. Our results showed that compared to MCF7 (luminal subtype) cells, MDA-MB-231(basal B subtype) cells are more responsive to Dexamethasone (Dex; a synthetic GC) treatment with the higher number of genes that were either up- or down-regulated. Shared by both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, the Dex-regulated genes are highly related to cell adhesion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), followed by the genes involved in signal transduction, cell division and apoptosis, including SERPIN-E1, CDKN2A, c-Myc, THBS1, Snai2 and E-cadherin. However, the up- and down-regulation patterns are different between MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells.

        "Background":"['Breast cancer remains a significant public health issue in the industrialized countries. Physicians depend on surgery, cytotoxic adjuvant chemotherapy, or radiation for treatment of breast cancer patients. Few novel therapies are approved for clinical use. Although existing therapies are effective in controling the disease in many patients, the cytotoxic side-effects make them limited. This is especially the case in the patients with early stage breast cancer whose prognosis with surgery alone is good and avoiding adjuvant chemotherapy would spare them toxic side effects. On the other hand, significant fraction of patients relapses and develops metastasis. Therefore, it is critical to identify markers for better breast cancer patient stratification based on their prognosis that would guide physicians in selection and aggressiveness of therapies. Recently, we linked transcription factor DMP1 (cyclin D binding protein 1, Dmtf1) as a critical tumor suppressor that blocks proliferative signals from ErbB2 and oncogenic Ras by activating p14Arf-p53 pathway. hDMP1 is hemizygously deleted in 50% of human breast tumors that retain wild-type ARF and p53. In this study we identified an upstream kinase, MEKK1, which cooperates with Dmp1 to activate Arf transcription. In constitutively active form (C-terminal kinase domain or CA-MEKK1), MEKK1 increased transcriptional activity of Dmp1 via direct phosphorylation, while the full length (regulatory and kinase domain) form behaved as a feedback inhibitor by increasing Dmp1 ubiquitination. Phosphorylation sites on DMP1 that increase its transcriptional activity were mapped to the C-terminal transactivation domain. Expression of CA-MEKK1 in breast cancer cell lines activated endogenous Arf-p53 pathway. hMEKK1 is located on human 5q11 chromosome, a locus frequently deleted in breast and lung cancer. Since MEKK1 appeared to be an activator of p53 tumor suppressor pathway, we wondered if MEKK1 is involved in human cancer. Using DNA from breast cancer patient tumors and matched normal tissue, we analyzed hMEKK1 gene deletion using specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) primers. MEKK1 was found hemizygously deleted in 20% of patients. Immunohistochemistry confirmed reduction of MEKK1 protein intensity to LOH(+) compared to LOH (-) patients. In the independent cohort of breast cancer patients, we show that low MEKK1 mRNA expression is associated with adverse outcome. Here we show that constitutively active MEKK1 is a novel activator of Dmp1-Arf-p53 pathway via Dmp1 phosphorylation. The MEKK1 gene was frequently deleted in breast tumor tissue and its expression was correlated with disease outcome. Overall, MEKK1 is a potential prognostic/predictive indicator for breast cancer and could be used by physicians to better stratify patients.']",

Although breast cancer survival has increased during the past two decades due to adjuvant endocrine therapy with antiestrogens (AE) such as Tamoxifen (TAM) and Faslodex (FAS) the risk of acquired endocrine-resistance still persists for many women. This can be mimicked by a prolonged culture of breast cancer cells with sequentially increasing concentrations of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4OHT; 1 nM -1 M), applying a selection pressure for cells to acquire resistance to 4OHT. Such cells maintain their resistant phenotype even after removal of the pressure (Brunner et al., 1993). The aim of this study was to determine whether a green tea polyphenol (EGCG) can affect the development of TAM-resistance in breast cancer. We tested the efficacy of EGCG, in this long-term [LT] cell culture model. Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 cells (n=2/group) were cultured in media containing', \" i) Vehicle (0.01% EtOH;, LT-V); ii) LT-4OHT (1 nM to 1 M; increasing every 3rd passage; LT-4OHT); or iii) 4OHT (1 nM to 1 M) + EGCG (100 nM;single dose;LT-EGCG). Growth rate was recorded for each passage (P), measured as the time required reach confluence (70%), after which the cells were subcultured. We will present results of this LT study including mechanisms by which EGCG may alter resistance-development, focusing on signaling pathways such as ER, NFkB and unfolded protein response (UPR) known to be involved in endocrine resistance. During the initial passages (P1-P6; [4OHT]  5 nM) the cells grew at the same rate regardless of the treatment. Starting at P8, time to confluence was delayed for LT-4OHT ([10 nM]; 7d) compared to the LT-V. This delay was even more pronounced at P15 ([100 nM];  21d), suggesting that cells were under a growth inhibition/selection pressure. The growth rate of LT-EGCG did not differ from LT-4OHT prior to P15, but in subsequent passages a delay was evident (14 to 18 d). To test whether the cells maintained their (delayed growth) phenotype, they were first cultured in regular media for 24h and tested for growth inhibition by 4OHT (1 nM-1M) and FAS (100 nM). LT-V cells (P27) were more susceptible to the inhibitory effects of 1 M 4OHT (73  11% versus 0 M 4OHT) than LT-4OHT cells (P19; 105  40%), confirming the development of resistance in LT-4OHT cells. In contrast, LT-EGCG cells had retained their sensitivity to 4OHT, similar to LT-V (P19; 75  8%). All treatment groups were equally responsive to FAS (30%). These results suggest that EGCG may delay the development of a 4OHT-resistance in breast cancer cells. It will be confirmed whether the effect prevails after removal of selection pressure (4OHT). This data will provide a better understanding of green tea's potential to prevent TAM-resistance in breast cancer patients.\"]",

We previously found an association of exposure to total suspended particulates (TSP) in early life and breast cancer risk among post-menopausal women. Particulate matter and secondhand smoke (SHS) have been associated with aberrant DNA methylation. To our knowledge the relation between early life exposure to air pollution via SHS or TSP and aberrant DNA methylation has not been examined in breast cancer tissues.Purpose', ' We investigated the association between breast tumor DNA methylation in the promoter regions for 11 genes and exposure to TSP at the time of birth and SHS before age 20. We hypothesized that these exposures lead to hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes in breast cancer tumor tissue in post-menopausal cases.Methods', ' A case-case study design, utilizing breast cancer cases participating in the WEB Study, a large population-based case-control study, was used to investigate our hypotheses. Five hundred and four archived tumor blocks from breast cancer cases were retrieved, DNA was extracted and methylation of 11 genes (SFN, ESR1, GSTP1, RASSF1, RARB, SYK, SCGB3A1, CDKN2A, CCND2, BRCA1, and FHIT ) was assayed with pyrosequencing. TSP exposure at birth address was estimated with ArcGIS 8.0 (ESRI, Inc., Redlands, CA), based on annual average TSP concentrations (1959-1997). Participants reported household SHS exposure before age 20. Hypermethylation was defined as mean methylation greater than 20%. Unconditional logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for age, estrogen receptor status and current smoking status.Results', ' Exposure to SHS before age 20 was associated with decreased average methylation (OR', ' 0.83; 95% CI', ' 0.50, 1.41) as was TSP exposure at birth (OR', ' 0.56; 95% CI', ' 0.29, 1.11), although these associations were imprecise. Exposure to SHS before age 20 was associated with decreased FHIT methylation (OR', ' 0.39; 95% CI', ' 0.17, 0.89). The other genes assessed showed similar inverse risk estimates and imprecision.Conclusions', ' While our results are necessarily preliminary, they are not consistent with our hypothesis that TSP or SHS exposure in early life is associated with DNA hypermethylation of promoter regions of genes in breast cancer tumor tissue. Inferences are complicated by several limitations. For instance, air pollution may have a stronger impact on global DNA hypomethylation. However these findings could also be attributed to low variability in exposures, relatively small sample size, or the choice of loci and genes assayed.']",

        "Background":"['The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is constitutively active in breast cancer (BC) and contributes to malignant transformation by promoting cell cycle progression, inhibiting apoptosis and mediating tumor immune evasion. Stat3 inhibition induces expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. On the other hand, it has been shown that oncogene inactivation induces cellular senescence and the secretion of senescence-associated secretome (SAS) in diverse tumor types. We recently described that Stat3 blockade leads to a senescence program in murine BC cells, which is accompanied by the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, we demonstrated that immunization of mice with syngeneic Stat3 blocked BC cells induces an antitumoral immune response that involves the participation of CD4+ Th cells and cytotoxic NK cells. In this study our objectives were to study whether immunization with supernatants (SN) produced by Stat3-blocked cells induces an antitumor immune response and to explore the contribution of senescence phenotype in this response. For that purpose we used BC models of ErbB-2-positive, JIMT-1 and KPL-4 cells (human) and C4HD cells (murine), and of triple negative, MDA-MB231 cells (human) and 4T1 cell (murine). Knockdown of Stat3 with siRNA in these cells, induced senescence (assessed by acidic -galactosidase staining). In human BC cells the senescent phenotype was accompanied by up-regulation of p21cip1 and downregulation of Rb expressions. In mouse BC cells we observed an increased expression of p16ink4a. In addition, simultaneous transfection with siRNAs targeting Stat3 and p16ink4a reverted the senescent phenotype. Then, we used a pre-clinical model in which we embedded the SN of C4HD cells in a slow-delivery depot as an adjuvant of a cellular immunotherapy. We immunized the animals with irradiated C4HD cells together with a depot containing lyophilized SN of C4HD cells transfected in vitro either with Stat3 siRNA (senescent) and Stat3 and p16ink4a siRNA (non-senescent), or a control siRNA. After 3 immunizations, with 15 d of interval between them, animals were challenged with C4HD tumor and tumor growth was monitored for 40 d. We observed that immunization with SN of cells with Stat3 siRNA decreased tumor growth vs. control siRNA group. Interestingly, there was no difference between tumor growth of animals immunized with SN of cells with Stat3 siRNA vs Stat3 and p16ink4a siRNA. We observed in these two groups greater cytotoxic activity of NK cells and an increase in the number of memory CD4+ T cells vs. control.These results suggest that Stat3 blockade drives a senescence program also in human BC cells. The secretome of Stat3-blocked BC cells is an effective adjuvant and could be formulated for immunotherapies independently of the SAS. Defining the protein, peptide, cytokine, chemokine composition of this supernatant opens up new avenues for immunotherapy in cancer patients.']",

To study the role of hyperlipidemia in HER2 cancer progression, we used two mouse models with elevated LDL cholesterol', ' Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/-), and LDLR knockout (LDLR-/-) mice on an FVB/n background. ApoE-/-, LDLR-/- and control (WT) mice were placed on a western diet at 8-10 weeks of age.

We used the MCNeuA (MMTV-Neu derived) breast cancer cells to study the effect of hyperlipidemia on Her2/Neu positive breast cancer in this model, as the MCNeuA cells were found to have high levels of LDLR protein expression compared with other murine breast cancer cell lines. To study the importance of the LDLR in mediating the effects of hyperlipidemia, we knocked down the LDLR in the MCNeuA cells using shRNA, and selected two cell clones with successful gene knockdown confirmed by RNA and protein analysis. ApoE-/-, LDLR-/- and WT mice on the western diet were injected into the 4th mammary fat pad with 2 x 106 MCNeuA (MMTV-Neu derived) control shRNA or MCNeuA LDLR knockdown clone 1 or clone 2 cells (n=6-10 mice per group).

Western blot analysis of tumor protein lysates showed an increase in p19 cleaved caspase 3 in the tumors with LDLR knockdown, compared with the control cells. In vitro studies demonstrated a decrease in survival of MCNeuA cells with LDLR knockdown in serum starved conditions, and an increase in caspase 3 cleavage. These data demonstrate that hyperlipidemia promotes the growth of Her2/Neu overexpressing breast cancer cells and the LDLR plays an important role in protecting Her2 / Neu tumors from apoptosis. Therefore, targeting cholesterol uptake and metabolism may be an important strategy for women with HER2 positive breast cancers.']",

        "Background":"['Approximately 60-70% of invasive breast cancers express estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor and are termed hormone receptor positive (ER+). Endocrine therapy remains the therapeutic backbone for the treatment of ER+ cancers and although anti-estrogen therapies are initially frequently effective, 50% of ER+ patients develop resistance to hormonal manipulation within their lifetime, ultimately leading to therapeutic failure. Two emerging mechanisms of endocrine resistance include activation of growth signaling pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and more recently, the decoupling of cell cycle control from ER-signaling, via deregulation of the cyclinD-cyclin dependent kinase (CDK-4/6', 'INK4', 'Rb) pathway. In this study we hypothesized that combining an anti-estrogen (letrozole or fulvestrant) with a CDK-4/6 inhibitor (LEE011) and PI3K inhibitors (buparlisib [BKM120; pan-PI3K inhibitor] or BYL719 [-specific PI3K inhibitor] would elicit an improved tumor response over agents inhibiting either pathway alone.Four ER+ BC mouse models including, an ER+ patient primary human letrozole sensitive model (HBX34, PTEN/PIK3CA wild-type) and three ER+ cell lines; ZR75-1 (PTEN null), MCF7 (PIK3CA mutant) and KPL1 (PTEN/PIK3CA wild-type) were used for this study. Treatment was carried out daily at doses relevant to clinical exposures for a period of 4 weeks with fulvestrant combinations and 8 weeks with letrozole combinations followed by observation for tumor progression. Treatment doses were as follows', ' LEE011 (75 mg/kg), BKM120 (30mg/kg), BYL719 (35mg/kg), Letrozole (2.5mg), Fulvestrant (5mg/wk) either as single agents or in combinations (Hormone therapy (HT)+LEE011, HT+PI3Ki, HT+LEE011+PI3Ki).Significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was observed for single agent treatment with the CDK-4/6 inhibitor in each of the four ER+ xenograft models. The addition of letrozole (HBX34) or fulvestrant (MCF7, ZR751 and KPL1) with LEE011 increased the TGI observed with single agent. The triplet combination with each PI3K inhibitor increased the (TGI) even further, inducing tumor regressions in each of the four models. Response was independent of PI3K/PTEN mutation status. Complete tumor regressions were observed for a subset of mice within each of the triple combination arms. Tumor regressions were maintained for up to four weeks post-interruption of treatment. No significant toxicities were observed with any of the triplet combinations.These preclinical data highlight the potential efficacy and safety of targeting the ER, CDK-4/6 and PI3K signaling pathways in ER+ breast cancer. LEE011 in combination with an anti-estrogen is sufficient to inhibit tumor growth in vivo, while the addition of a PI3K inhibitor results in robust tumor regressions. The combination of LEE011 with an anti-estrogen and a PI3K inhibitor is a rational therapeutic approach that should be investigated in the clinic.']",

Meta-analyses of public datasets have revealed new subgroups, but these studies are plagued by samples collected from multiple protocols and poor reproducibility. We aimed to identify stable subsets that could be treated with targeted therapy by employing integrated genomic profiling of a large number of TNBC cases (confirmed by IHC) from a single protocol before applying those subgroups to publicly available TNBC sets.We employed non-negative matrix factorization on two independent gene expression datasets (Discovery n = 84 and Validation n = 118) using the top 1000 variant genes in each set. Cophenetic, dispersion, and silhouette metrics revealed 4 clusters, with significant enrichment of differentially expressed (DE) genes in each subgroup among both sets (all comparisons Fisher Exact p < 2.2E-16). A parsimonious gene centroid signature of 480 total genes was selected based on Goeman's Global Test BH-adjusted p-values and fold change of only the Discovery Set. Subgroups were assigned by Pearson Correlation in the Discovery (Rand Index = 0.97) and Validation Sets (RI = 0.84), as well as an External Set made up of 214 IHC-confirmed cases of TNBCs, and another 5 publicly available studies with clinical outcome data for TNBCs. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was carried out separately on DE genes from each dataset (BH adjusted p < 0.01). There was overwhelming statistical agreement for all subgroups between the Discovery, Validation, and External Sets. Subgroup 1 was defined by Intermediate Grade LumB tumors and overexpression of ESR1, HER-2, and AR, with activated downstream signaling of ESR1 despite being ER- by IHC. In subgroup 2, CDKN2A and TP53 appeared activated while MYC was inhibited. Dozens of immune cell signaling pathways were downregulated in the third subgroup, a basal-like set of TNBCs, which was driven by inhibition of cytokine gamma-IFN. Disease-free and Overall Survival was the worst for subgroup 3 (log rank p = 0.041 and 0.039). The final subgroup (4) was found to be p53 inactivated, a known feature of TNBC but specific to this second basal-like subgroup. Analysis of 84 and 58 cases with corresponding copy number profiling data from the Discovery and Validation Sets revealed subgroup specific copy number changes in addition to known TNBC patterns. Most notably, loss of chr 6 was unique to subgroup 1, while all other tumors shared common loss of chr 5.We have described four molecular phenotypes of TNBC in two independent sets from the same protocol, and a third set composed of public data. These subgroups have strong agreement of DE genes, pathways, and regulators, and are additionally supported by DNA events and prognostic differences between subgroups.

        "Background":"['One general characteristic of fast-growing solid tumors including breast cancer is the development of intratumoral hypoxia. The activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) by intratumoral hypoxia stimulates a group of downstream genes including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that are responsible for tumor malignant progression. Loss of p16 expression occurs in many cancers including breast cancer. Our studies showed that, by ectopic expression via adenoviral-mediated gene transfer, p16 downregulates VEGF gene expression by neutralizing the transactivation of HIF-1, and suppresses breast cancer angiogenesis and metastasis. To investigate whether p16 directly affects one or more aspects of the metastatic cascade, MDA-MB-231 cells infected with lentivirus expressing Tet-on inducible p16 were used to study the p16 effects on growth, adhesion and migration of the breast cancer cells. We found that p16 inhibits MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation (45.6% inhibition) and hypoxia-induced cell migration (36% inhibition), but has no apparent effect on cell adhesion. The p16-mediated inhibition of hypoxia-induced cell migration parallels with p16s inhibition of HIF-1 transactivation activity. These results indicate that p16s ability to suppress breast tumor metastasis may result from a combined p16-mediated actions including inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. This study suggests that p16 gene therapy may have clinical potentials to treat breast cancer due to p16s multiple-level anti-cancer capabilities', ' inhibiting proliferation, inducing apoptosis, blocking tumor angiogenesis, inhibiting cell migration and suppressing metastasis.']",

        "Background":"['Having in mind that Stat3 inhibition in tumor cells induces the expression of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines, we proposed the use of Stat3-inhibited breast cancer cells as a source of immunogens to induce an anti-tumor immune response. We have demonstrated that the administration of irradiated breast cancer cells that express a dominant negative (DN) form of Stat3 (Stat3Y705F-breast cancer cells) provides protection against the murine progestin-dependent C4HD tumor, through the activation of CD4+ T cells and cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells. To extend our results to different breast cancer models, we worked with the hormone independent 4T1 mammary carcinoma cell line that displays constitutive activation of Stat3. Immunization with irradiated Stat3Y705F-4T1 cells prevented wild-type 4T1 tumor development in 50% of the challenged mice (P<0.001), and the tumor-bearing mice displayed tumors of smaller size (81% decrease in tumor volume, P<0.001) when compared to mice injected with pcDNA3.1-4T1 cells. Moreover, the number of metastasis per lung decreased by 90% in Stat3Y705F-4T1-immunized animals (P<0.05). When we analyzed the tumor milieu composition by flow cytometry, we observed that Stat3Y705F-4T1 immunized animals displayed an increase in the percentage of tumor infiltrating NK cells (CD3-DX5+) and a decrease in tumor infiltrating T regulatory lymphocytes (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+), compared to pcDNA3.1-4T1-immunized mice. In order to evaluate if this vaccination may be effective in a therapeutic setting, we immunized mice with irradiated Stat3Y705F-4T1 or pcDNA3.1-4T1 cells, 4, 11 and 18 days after challenging with 4T1 cells. On day 35, we observed a significant decrease on tumor volume and growth rate in Stat3Y705F-4T1 cell-immunized animals, when compared to mice immunized with pcDNA3.1-4T1 cells (37.5%, P<0.05) and a decrease in the number of metastasis per lung (P<0.05). On the other hand, cellular senescence is an important mechanism of tumor regression upon oncogene inactivation that leads to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines that resemble the ones we found after blocking Stat3. Therefore, we wondered whether Stat3 inhibition could drive a senescence program. Inhibition of Stat3 in murine C4HD and 4T1 cells by transfection with Stat3Y705F, or Stat3 silencing by siRNA, resulted in increased senescence-associated--galactosidase (SA--gal) accumulation and increased expression of the senescence-associated markers p15INK4b and p16INK4a. As cellular senescence is associated to chromatin changes, we studied heterochromatin formation and observed an increase of trimethyl-K4 histone H3 upon Stat3 inhibition. As a whole, our findings indicate that Stat3 inhibition in breast cancer cells induce an increase in immunogenicity capable of eliciting an anti tumor immune response, presumably through the activation of a senescence program.']",

P16INK4a is a known surrogate marker for HPV positivity; however the relationship between radiation sensitivity and P16INK4a has not been completely elucidated in this context. Ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7), also known as HAUSP, is a deubiquitylating enzyme that cleaves ubiquitin from substrates to stabilize target proteins. USP7 overexpression is a predictor of poor prognosis in lung carcinomas and correlates with disease progression and lower survival in gliomas.

Multiplex panel testing may be an efficient way of evaluating MP patients for the presence of germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes. However the spectrum of mutations in many cancer susceptibility genes in the MP patient population is largely unknown. We performed massively parallel sequencing using targeted capture of 15 genes with well-established risks of breast and/or other cancers, specifically TP53, CDH1, PTEN, STK11, ATM, CHEK2, MRE11A, NBN, RAD50, PALB2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and MUTYH. Our patient cohort consisted of 221 BRCA1/2 negative patients diagnosed with breast cancer and at least one other primary cancer, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. Patients diagnosed with contralateral breast cancer were included. Thirty patients (14%) were found to have at least one deleterious variant in these 15 genes. Deleterious variants were found in CHEK2 (16 patients, 7.2%), TP53 (4, 1.8%), MSH6 (3, 1.4%), ATM (2, 0.9%) and one patient each had deleterious variants in CDKN2A, PTEN, PMS2, PALB2, BRIP1 and NBN. In addition, six patients (2.7%) were found to be heterozygous carriers of a MUTYH mutation. In comparison, deleterious variants were identified in 9% of 341 patients with breast cancer only, indicating a small but nonsignificant increase in the rate of deleterious variants in MP patients. The rate of MUTYH heterozygous mutations was also non-significantly different in patients with breast cancer only (1.2%). There was a significant increase in the rate of CHEK2 and MSH6 mutations in the MP versus breast-only patients (7.2% vs 3.5%, p = 0.04 for CHEK2 and 1.4% vs 0%, p = 0.05 for MSH6). As a corollary study, a subset of MP patients (n = 165) were assayed on a panel including TET2. Deleterious TET2 mutations were identified in 2 of 165 patients (1.2%) at allele frequencies of 0.17 and 0.36. These patients blood samples were ascertained at ages 77 and 72, respectively. These preliminary data show that in our cohort of patients with multiple primary cancers, over 16% of patients were found to have deleterious variants in 15 cancer susceptibility genes. In addition, approximately 1% of MP patients have deleterious variants in TET2 that may be due to age-related clonal hematopoiesis, although it is unknown if these mutations are related to the development of the tumors in these individuals. Further analysis of variants in less well-characterized cancer susceptibility genes and unclassified variants is ongoing. Discovery of clinically relevant mutations can potentially guide future treatment practices for those with similar diagnoses to our patients.']",

It is of utmost importance to know the clonal relationship between multiple tumor localizations, (multiple primaries or metastasized disease), since prognosis and treatment differ between these tumors and their metastases. We evaluated the value of targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in the diagnostic workup of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with 2 tumor localizations and uncertain tumor origins.METHODSForty-two female BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with 2 tumor locations with tumor material available for pathologic revision were selected. Median age at first cancer diagnosis was 48.0 years (range 30-68). Four patients with inconclusive tumor origin after histological and immunohistochemical analyses were cases; 10 patients with certain tumor origin of 3 tumors served as controls. Tumors of cases and controls were analyzed by targeted NGS using a panel including CDKN2A, PTEN and TP53, hotspot mutation sites for 27 different genes and 143 single nucleotide polymorphisms for detection of loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Based on prevalence of identical or different mutations and/or LOH patterns, tumors were classified as multiple primaries or one entity.RESULTSIn 44 tumors, 48 mutations were found; 39 (81%) concerned TP53 mutations. In all 10 controls and all 4 cases, the intrapatient clonal relationships between the tumors could be unequivocally identified by molecular analysis. In all controls, tumor origins based on molecular outcomes matched the conventional histopathological diagnosis.CONCLUSIONIn 90% of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with multiple tumors routine pathology work-up is sufficient to determine tumor origins and relatedness. In case of inconclusive conventional pathology results, molecular analyses using NGS can reliably determine clonal relationships between tumors, enabling optimal treatment of individual patients.']",

        "Background":"['Germline mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 underlie joint susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers, but do not account for all cases. Genome wide association studies show little overlap between common variants associated with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility, whereas rare variants in genes initially identified as breast cancer susceptibility genes also confer susceptibility to ovarian cancer cases, unselected for breast cancer. Ovarian and breast tumors also are observed in Peutz-Jeghers and possibly in Lynch syndrome. To further elucidate rare germline susceptibilities for breast and ovarian cancer, we have ascertained a unique cohort of 90 BRCA1/2-negative probands with a personal history of breast cancer and ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancer, unselected for family history. Cases are from the clinical genetics services of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and University of Pennsylvania. Analysis is ongoing using both targeted and exome sequencing approaches. Germline DNA of 69 cases will be subjected to whole exome sequencing. A total of 21 additional cases will undergo targeted sequencing for 28 genes (8 cases) and an extended panel of 54 genes (13 cases). The majority of ovarian cancers are high-grade serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma (n=51), in combination with invasive ductal or DCIS (n=36), invasive lobular (n=4), or unspecified (n=11) breast cancers. The remaining ovarian subgroups comprise other epithelial subtypes; endometrioid (n=9), clear cell (n=3), mucinous and low-grade serous (n=3) and non-epithelial (n=4) or unclassified (n=20), in combination with invasive ductal or DCIS (n=21), invasive lobular (n=5) or unspecified (n=13) breast cancers. Preliminary analysis of the targeted set of genes in 69 cases, reveals 43 predicted pathogenic coding or splice site variants; 17 of which are within PALB2, MSH2, MSH6, BARD1, FANCE, CDKN2A, TP53, SETD2, SIRT1, BRIP1, RAD50, and RAD51D and are not seen in dbSNP138, 1000 Genomes or Exome Variant Server ESP6500 and 26 variants with reported frequencies in MUTYH, MSH6, MLH1, FAM175A, RAD50, UIMC1, JARID2, PHF3, SIRT1, MRE11A, ATM, BRCA2, TP53BP1, CDH1, RAD51D, BRCA1, BABAM1 of less than 1% allele frequency in public databases. Analysis of these variants across and within histologic subtypes is being undertaken to look for specific genotype-phenotype correlations. Analysis of novel candidate genes and pathways by co-segregation, functional analysis, as well as external replication is underway to determine whether shared rare variants, mutated genes, or altered pathways confer cancer susceptibility in this cohort. Germline susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer is heterogenous and remains a critical research and clinical question. Improved understanding of the susceptibility genetics will allow further examination of the utility of targeted cancer prevention strategies in those who are found to be at risk.']",

Using two prognostic gene signatures and an experimentally defined proliferative signature, highly concordant results for the top ranking sets of MTRs were found. One advantage of this process was the distillation of gene signatures into a discrete, mechanistically anchored biomarker set shown to be prognostically relevant, particularly in ER-positive patients, and with an ability to discriminate patients into low versus high risk of recurrence. Our aim here was to determine if the OncoMasTR panel was similarly useful in multiple other cancer types using publicly available transcriptomic data.

Various targeted therapies are being clinically and preclinically tested for BC management. MIBC have been associated with loss of cell cycle control. Defects in the RB pathway are a major mechanisms of cell cycle deregulation in MIBC. RB1 mutations were reported in 13% of TCGA samples, although significant mutations also were noted in CDKN1A, CDKN2A, and CCND3. The CDK 4/6 complex combines with cyclin D1 to inhibit RB activity. Therapeutic targeting of this complex improves outcome in ER positive advanced breast cancer. Methods', ' Palbociclib (PD-0332991) is a cdk4/6 inhibitor currently tested for the treatment of other malignancies characterized by the presence of a functional RB1 gene.

Results', ' unexpectedly, we observed a similar response to Palbociclib in pRb wt and pRb mutant cell lines in vitro and in xenografts in vivo, although with different biochemical and cell cycle effects. Genomic characterization of these treated cells shows strong gene expression divergence as a consequence of Palbociclib treatment in pRb wt and mutant cells. Nonetheless, bioinformatic analyses revealed FoxM1 as a possible common regulator of some downregulated genes in both cases. Importantly, FoxM1 has been demonstrated a bona fide cdk4 substrate and may confer cis-platinum resistance. We observed reduced FoxM1 phosphorylation upon Palbociclib treatment in all cell lines tested, and also increased sensitivity to cis-platinum. Remarkably, we found that phosphorylated FoxM1 is a potential poor prognosis factor in human BC clinical samples. Conclusions', ' in our study we observed that the activity of Palbociclib in BC cell lines is independent on the RB1 status and showed synergistic activity with cisplatin. Future studies, using mouse models based on the genetic inactivation of Rb1 with other tumor suppressor genes, will precede the possible development of appropriate clinical trials testing the use of Palbociclib in the management of BC patients.']",

        "Background":"['Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most prevalent form of primary brain cancer in adults. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to drive the growth and metastasis of tumors, and are readily isolated from GBM patient tumors. These GBM CSCs are maintained under serum-free conditions in neurosphere media, and form tumors upon orthotopic injection in mice. However, when grown in the presence of serum, GBM CSCs undergo morphological changes, have reduced proliferation, exhibit loss of stem cell markers, and have reduced tumorigenicity following orthotopic implantation into the brains of immune compromised mice. Upon return to serum-free neurosphere media, these GBM CSCs revert to neurospheres. We set out to define the transcriptional incongruities between these culture condition-dependent states, and the underlying epigenetic changes which regulate these differences in gene expression. Although genetic alterations in cancer are irreversible, epigenetic changes are inherently reversible, and we hypothesize that the plasticity between culture condition-dependent states is mediated by epigenetic regulation of genes relevant to the ability of these cells to form tumors. Recently, a novel epigenetic mark, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), has been shown to be enriched at regulatory elements within polycomb target genes in embryonic stem cells, and is frequently found at genes that are involved in the maintenance of stem cells. We found that 5hmC levels of several polycomb target genes, including p16INK4A and several components of the TGF-beta pathway involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), are altered in neurospheres compared to CSCs cultured in serum. Loss of p16INK4A expression has recently been associated with increased CSC abundance in breast cancer, and our results suggest that a similar trend exists in GBM. Furthermore, our results suggest that 5hmC is involved in the regulation of polycomb target genes in CSCs, including p16INK4A and components of the TGF-beta pathway.

        "Background":"['Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) affects over 44,000 people in the United States every year and carries a dismal prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of just 5%. A subset of these patients (5-10%) report a familial history of the disease. The genetic etiology in these familial cases is poorly defined, with known susceptibility genes, such as', ' BRCA2, PALB2, CDKN2A, BRCA1, PRSS1 and STK11, accounting for only 10-15% of familial pancreatic cancer. In an effort to identify previously unappreciated pancreatic cancer susceptibility genes, we used next generation sequencing technology to evaluate the whole genome and whole exome sequences of 16 (6 families) and 22 individuals (10 families) respectively. All of these families enrolled into one of the familial pancreatic cancer registries participating in the Pancreatic Cancer Genetic Epidemiology (PacGene) Consortium, all had at least three members with PDA, and DNA was available from at least two affected members in each kindred. Using this approach, we identified heterozygous, inactivating, ATM mutations in two kindreds with familial pancreatic cancer (c.8266A>AT; p.K2756X and c.170G>GA; p.W57X). These mutations were previously reported as disease causing variants in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia, an autosomal recessive condition resulting from bi-allelic deleterious mutations of ATM. Interestingly, heterozygotes of deleterious ATM mutations have an increased risk of breast cancer. However, there have been no previous reports of deleterious ATM mutations in the germline of familial PDA patients. In our study, mutations segregated with disease in both kindreds and tumor analysis demonstrated Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type allele. Sequence analysis of the entire ATM gene in an additional 166 familial pancreatic cancer probands indentified four additional patients with deleterious mutations in the ATM gene (c.3214G>GT; p.E1072X, c.6095G>GA; p.R2032K, IVS41-1G>GT and c.3801delG), while no deleterious mutations were identified in 190 spouse controls (p=0.046). When considering only the mostly severely affected families, those with three or more pancreatic cancer cases, four deleterious mutations were found in 87 families (P=0.009). These results indicate that ATM mutations play an important role in familial pancreatic cancer predisposition and have significant implications in the management of affected individuals and the risk assessment of family members.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Detection rates for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) have dramatically increased because of the widespread use of mammographic screening. The heterogeneity among multiple DCIS lesions within the same patient, also diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), has not been well evaluated, leaving clinical and research implications of this intra-individual heterogeneity of DCIS yet to be explored. In the study presented here, we tested the hypothesis that classification of heterogeneous DCIS based on adjacent IDC and normal terminal duct lobular units (TDLU) in patients concurrently diagnosed with IDC and DCIS helps to identify DCIS subgroups which have different degrees of aggressiveness.Experimental Designs and Results', ' Ten DCIS lesions from each of 36 patients concurrently diagnosed with DCIS and IDC were randomly selected and scored with IHC biomarkers. Our results showed that expression of PR, HER2, Ki-67 and p16 varied significantly in DCIS lesions from a single patient (P < 0.05 for PR; P < 1  10-8 for HER2, Ki-67 and p16). In addition, seventy-two percent of the individuals had heterogeneous expression in at least 2/6 markers (P < 10-18, vs. hypothesized homogeneity baseline, 10%). Importantly, by comparing the expression of promising DCIS risk biomarkers (Ki-67, p53 and p16) among different DCIS subgroups, we found that DCIS lesions in subgroup IIb, which had the same molecular subtypes as the adjacent IDC but not the same subtypes as the adjacent TDLU, had a higher Ki-67 index (P < 10-7), a higher chance of positive p53 staining (P = 0.02), and less p16 staining (P = 0.08) than those in type I DCIS lesions with different molecular subtypes from the adjacent IDC. Further molecular characterization by microarray analysis identified that 246 annotated coding and non-coding genes were differentially expressed between DCIS subgroups Type I and IIb [FC (fold change)>2.0, P<0.05]. A majority of genes were upregulated in type IIb DCIS and more than 50% of genes are cancer-relevant (P < 10-8-2). Importantly, a group of differentially expressed genes in subgroup IIb including CD44, IFIT1, STAT1, MLH1, PARP9 and BRIP1 were confirmed by qPCR validation and likely play important roles in DCIS progression based on previous findings, which further support that Type IIb DCIS may represent a highly aggressive subgroup.Conclusions', ' By using a systematic approach, our results clearly demonstrate that intra-individual heterogeneity in DCIS is very common in patients concurrently diagnosed with IDC. Our novel findings of a DCIS subpopulation with high-aggressiveness will provide a new paradigm for mechanistic studies of breast tumor progression and also have broad implications for prevention research as heterogeneous pre-invasive lesions are present in many other cancer types.This work was kindly supported by the Susan G.

        "Background":"['High childhood and adolescent dietary intake of isoflavone genistein (GEN) in soyfoods reduces later breast cancer risk, but since GEN has estrogenic properties, it is not clear whether it is safe to start consuming it after breast cancer has been diagnosed. Using a new preclinical model, we investigated the effects of childhood, adult and/or post-diagnosis consumption of GEN on the ability of tamoxifen (TAM) to treat breast cancer.95 female Sprague-Dawley rats consuming AIN93G diet were supplemented with 0 or 500 ppm GEN between postnatal days (PND) 15 to 30 (prepubertal exposure) and then were fed AIN93G diet with no GEN between PND 30 and 55. On PND 48, rats received 10 mg DMBA to induce mammary tumors, and were then divided to four dietary groups on PND 55', ' prepubertal GEN-adult GEN group (GG, n=20); prepubertal GEN-adult control group (GC, n=20); prepubertal control-adult GEN (CG, n=20); and control-control (CC, n=35). When mammary tumor reached a size of 1.4 cm in diameter, 337 ppm TAM was added to rats diet. GG and CG rats continued also consuming GEN, and all rats in GC and 20 rats in CC groups stated consuming GEN one week after the TAM treatment started. 15 CC rats were never fed GEN.Mammary tumor latency was longer in GG (p<0.003) and GC rats (p<0.095), compared to CC rats. The response of tumors to TAM treatment was classified as complete or partial response, or de novo resistant. Prepubertal and life-time GEN intake increased, and intake starting during TAM treatment reduced response to TAM (p<0.001). Mammary cancer recurrence rate was highest in the rats which started consuming GEN during TAM treatment, and significantly lower in life-time, prepubertal and adulthood only GEN intake groups (p<0.001). Brca1 mRNA level was highest in the mammary gland of life-time GEN consuming rats (p<0.05). Tumor suppressor genes p21WAF1/CIP1 and p16INK4a mRNA levels were significantly higher in both prepubertal GEN groups (GC and GG) than in CC rats (p<0.05), as was the expression of pro-apoptotic gene Bax (p<0.05). No changes in estrogen receptor (ER) protein expression in the mammary gland were seen among the groups, but progesterone receptor (p<0.05) and phosphorylated HER2/ErbB2 (p<0.05) were both expressed at a lower level in rats consuming GEN through the life-time, compared with rats which consumed GEN during adult life (CG rats).Our findings show that rats exposed prepubertally or through the life-time to GEN were at lower risk of developing TAM resistance than rats which started GEN intake in adulthood or post-diagnosis. The effect of prepubertal GEN exposure in increasing TAM responsiveness may be related to up-regulation of tumor suppressor genes Brca1, p16INK4a and p21WAF1/CIP1 in their mammary gland. Recurrence rate was highest in those rats that were consuming GEN for the first time during TAM treatment. If true for humans, women with ER+ breast cancer should not start consuming GEN during TAM treatment.']",

We have shown that the total-body burden of senescent cells can be estimated by measuring the expression of the p16 tumor suppressor, a canonical effector of senescence, in human CD3+ PBTC (Liu et al, Aging Cell, 2009). Expression of p16 increases more than 10-fold over an adult human lifespan, and this rate of accumulation is accelerated by age-promoting exposures such as CRx or stem cell transplant (Sanoff et al, JNCI 2014; Wood et al, EbioMed 2016).

The clinical applications envisioned with liquid biopsies range from monitoring of treatment response to disease progression and acquired resistance. However, the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is challenging owing to the small fraction of tumor specific DNA relative to background levels of non-tumor derived DNA and therefore requires highly specific and sensitive techniques.Experimental proceduresThe Ion AmpliSeqTM Cancer Hotspot Panel v2, covering 2,800 COSMIC mutations from 50 cancer genes was used to analyze 31 primary tumor and metastatic lesions along with 19 matched plasma samples from 13 breast cancer (BC) patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment and 6 advanced stage metastatic BC patients. Digital PCR (dPCR) experiments were set up using mutation-specific assays (Biorad) for the detection of 13 hotspot mutations in PIK3CA, TP53, PTEN, AKT1, CDKN2A and STK11 genes previously identified in the solid tumor samples using next generation sequencing (NGS).ResultsThe specificity and sensitivity of the mutation-specific dPCR assays were tested in dilution curves using synthetic oligonucleotides and tumor samples bearing the mutation of interest. Mutations could be robustly detected in plasma samples using dPCR with a sensitivity as low as 0.1% and a sensitivity of 0.5% using NGS. All mutations previously identified using NGS were validated using dPCR in tumor (n = 27) as well as in plasma samples (n = 5). Moreover, dPCR identified 4 additional mutations in 4 plasma samples in the neoadjuvant setting and 4 in the metastatic setting, 2 in tumor and 2 in plasma samples. The mutant allelic frequencies (MAF) of these newly identified mutations were very low (range 0.2%-1.8%) close to the detection limit of the technology. Through the use of dPCR, the detection rate of plasma ctDNA increased from 8% using NGS to 38% in the neoadjuvant setting and from 67% using NGS to 100% in the metastatic setting thereby highlighting the greater sensitivity of the dPCR technology. The MAF assessed by NGS and dPCR were highly correlated both in the neoadjuvant and metastatic (Spearman  = 0.84 and  = 0.97) settings, a higher concordance between NGS and dPCR being observed when the MAF are high.ConclusionsThe use of dPCR allows the detection of low-frequency tumor-specific mutations in plasma with a greater sensitivity compared to NGS providing the high accuracy and sensitivity essential for liquid biopsies.']",

        "Background":"['Targeting cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) with inhibitors such as abemaciclib has shown promise in early and late phase clinical trials in both breast cancer and NSCLC. While there is evidence that patients benefit from single-agent abemaciclib, combination strategies leveraging this compound together with immunotherapy are of interest for the treatment of these and other cancers. Consequently, it is important to understand if and how a cell cycle inhibitor can be combined with immunotherapy. However, because most preclinical studies have been performed using xenograft tumors in immune-compromised mice, the potential immunomodulatory effects of abemaciclib have not been adequately ascertained. To investigate the immune combinatorial potential of abemaciclib, we studied the effects of treatment alone and in combination with checkpoint immunotherapy in a murine syngeneic tumor model sensitive to abemaciclib using immuno-competent mice. Abemaciclib monotherapy of established murine CT26 tumors, which harbor KRAS G12C mutation and CDKN2A deletion, caused a dose-dependent delay in tumor growth. Surprisingly, gene expression analysis showed that treatment was associated with an increase in intra-tumor immune inflammation without major alteration in immune subset frequencies. Testing of various dosing regimens in this preclinical model found that monotherapy abemaciclib pretreatment followed by combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy, induced an enhanced anti-tumor response compared to abemaciclib and anti-PD-L1 monotherapies. Optimal combination therapy exhibited superior anti-tumor efficacy, resulting in complete tumor regression (CR) in 50-60% of mice in a setting where anti-PD-L1 monotherapy showed little or no efficacy (0% CRs). Mice which maintained CRs after cessation of combination therapy were able to resist later CT26 rechallenge, demonstrating that abemaciclib in combination with anti-PD-L1 enabled the generation of an immunologic memory. Examination of intra-tumor gene expression during treatment found that combination therapy further amplified the immune/T cell activation signature compared to both monotherapies. Intra-tumoral suppression of cell cycle genes, which are indicative of inhibition of CDK4/6, was also greater during the combination therapy, suggesting that the effects anti-PD-L1 therapy may augment the cell cycle arrest induced by abemaciclib. Although it was uncertain if agents that inhibit cell proliferation could be combined with immunotherapy, these preclinical results demonstrate that it is possible to combine CDK4/6 inhibition by abemaciclib with checkpoint immunotherapy to improve tumor efficacy. The synergistic responses observed in terms of tumor efficacy, immune activation, and cell cycle control provides support for the clinical investigation of this combination.']",

The majority of specimens (28/34) used for profiling were from primary breast sites and contained 50% neoplastic cells. The transcriptomes were profiled using Illumina's HumanHT-12 microarray (v4). Data were normalized using mean normalization procedure. Differential expression analysis was performed using R's Limma package. Pathway analysis was carried out using R's signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) package with 69 cancer, immunity, and cell signaling related KEGG pathways. Results\", ' Using a cutoff of two-fold and adjusted p-value of 0.05, we identified 954 genes differentially expressed between Cav1+/- TNBC patients.

Genes of notable interest for their role in cell signaling, cell adhesion, tumor invasion and metastasis, included an up-regulation of TGFBR2, SPARC, integrins (ITGA11, ITGB5, ITGBL1), cell adhesion proteins (LAMB3, COL5A3) and molecules which facilitate tumor invasion (LAMB3, MMP1, MMP2, MMP9). In addition, genes found to be down-regulated in Cav1+ patients and notable for their roles in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) included Claudin 3(CLD3) and CA125/MUC16 (Mucin 16). We also detected an approximately two-fold down-regulation of CDKN2A in Cav1+ patients. Using SPIA pathway analysis, 12 pathways were found to be differentially activated in Cav1+ vs. Cav1- TNBC. The most differentially activated pathways were the focal adhesion pathway (p = 4.51E-18), PI3k-Akt signaling pathway (p = 2.01E-6) and TGF- and MAPK signaling pathways (p = 0.005, 0.014, respectively). Conclusions', ' Differential gene expression patterns and pathway analyses provide evidence for distinct profiles for gene expression between Cav1+/- TNBC. Cav1+ TNBC patients exhibit up-regulation of genes important for cell signaling, extracellular matrix remodeling and tumor invasion, and down-regulation of genes that may facilitate EMT and loss of cell cycle control. The focal adhesion pathway, as well as TGF-, PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways, were identified as differentially activated among Cav1+/- TNBC. Taken together, these data support the role of Cav1+ in identifying a subtype of TNBC that may have a greater risk for invasion and metastasis.

Unlike for advanced disease, effective molecularly-driven interventions and risk assessment are not available for clinically normal tissues that may be have been exposed to carcinogens or for precancerous lesions. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) comprises 15-20% of all skin cancers and has the most accessible and clinically well-characterized progression sequence of any human cancer, from a distinct precancerous lesion, the actinic keratosis (AK), to invasive carcinoma. Thus, it is an ideal model for establishing a paradigm of molecularly targeted cancer chemoprevention.METHODS', ' Here, we performed next-generation sequencing of total RNA and miRNA (Illumina HiSeq) on matched isogenic samples of human cuSCC, surrounding normal (chronically irradiated) skin (NS), and AK. In parallel, we profiled matched samples from a UV-driven Hairless mouse model of cuSCC for cross-species analysis, to identify the most important drivers of progression from NS to AK to cuSCC.RESULTS', ' Unsupervised clustering of both mRNA and miRNA expression changes showed that preneoplastic AKs span a continuum indistinguishable from cuSCC or surrounding NS, whereas cuSCC and NS were easily distinguished. Through cross-species computational analysis of mRNA-miRNA functional pairs, we identified miR-21, miR-205, miR-31, let-7B, and miR-497 and their mRNA targets as core drivers of cuSCC development through the AK intermediate. We show that several of these miRNAs are modulated by UV exposure, regulate susceptibility to apoptosis, and regulate cell motility. Several miRNAs are being inhibited in our mouse model to validate them as chemoprevention targets. TRANSFAC analysis identified E2F, SP1, AP1, and TCF3 as key transcriptional regulators of SCC development. We tested the global mRNA and miRNA expression similarities to other tumor types profiled by the NIH TCGA effort, showing that cuSCC is most closely related to head & neck SCC, lung SCC, and basal subtype of breast cancer. Exome analysis confirmed a high frequency of TP53, NOTCH1/2, and CDKN2A mutations in cuSCC, with mutational loads of >30/Mb that are strongly dominated by UVB signature lesions. Surprisingly, NS contains evidence of numerous mutations reflecting UV-induced somatic mosaicism.CONCLUSIONS', ' We report the first integrated transcriptomic characterization of the development of cuSCC through the preneoplastic AK. AKs are indistinguishable from cuSCC, suggesting that chemoprevention efforts should be directed at UV-exposed skin prior to the emergence of lesions. Key transcriptional responses in miRNAs and transcription factor networks were identified in our cross-species analysis, which have been functionally validated. Finally, SCCs of diverse anatomic sites share deep genomic commonalities suggesting that there may be common chemoprevention strategies applicable to multiple SCC types.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Caffeine normalizes breast stromal fibroblasts and suppresses their pro-carcinogenic effects.",
        "Background":"['Breast cancer is the leading cause of morbidity and second-leading cause of death in women worldwide. Breast stromal fibroblasts, the most abundant and the most reactive cells of the tumor stroma, actively promote tumor growth, invasion, migration, angiogenesis and metastasis through elevated secretion of several factors including SDF1, MMP-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). These secretions are under the control of several tumor suppressor genes such as p16, p53 and CAV-1, which were fond to be down-regulated in most active fibroblasts. Therefore, our major aim in this study was to study the potential use of caffeine to up-regulate these tumor suppressor genes and hence reduces the secretion of these cancer-promoting factors. We have shown that low doses of caffeine up-regulate the tumor suppressor proteins p16, p21, p53 and CAV-1 in breast stromal fibroblasts. Consequently, the expression and secretion of MMP-2 and VEGF-A was reduced following caffeine treatment. Moreover, caffeine reduced the expression of SDF-1, TGF- and -SMA, three important markers of active fibroblast, suggesting that caffeine has the ability of normalizing stromal fibroblasts. To further confirm this, we have shown that caffeine suppresses stromal fibroblast-related enhancement of invasion/migration of breast cancer cells. Importantly, this effect was mediated through caffeine-dependent inactivation of the two major invasion/migration protein kinases Akt and Erk, through up-regulating PTEN in breast stromal fibroblasts. Furthermore, caffeine suppressed the expression/secretion of VEGF-A in breast stromal fibroblasts and their paracrine enhancement of angiogenesis in vitro. This effect was mediated through inhibition of the VEGF-A activator HIF-1. Therefore, we have clearly shown here that caffeine, a natural and pharmacologically safe product, has the potential to normalize breast stromal fibroblasts and consequently suppresses their paracrine procarcinogenic effects.']",

        "Background":"['Spontaneous immortalization of benign mammary epithelial cells (MEC) in culture is very rare. Models of MEC immortalization suggest that cells escape M0 growth arrest (selection) by silencing p16 expression afterwhich they encounter a second growth arrest, M1 (agonescence), characterized by telomere shortening and profound genomic instability. Pre-selection, post-selection, and spontaneously immortalized MEC from a woman with a germline STK11 mutation were subjected to a comprehensive OMICS evaluation including miRNA, transcriptome, methylome, exome, and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) in order to understand the molecular events associated with MEC immortalization. Principle component analysis of gene expression identified 4 significant components, the first of which showed the greatest separation between the different time points. The most notable expression changes were upregulation of FOXQ1, IL1-related genes, Ras-related genes, and fibronectin and downregulation of COL1, COL6, CK19, and CDH1. MEC gradually acquired global hypomethylation of non-CpG DNA and regional hypermethylation of CpG islands (including p16). A classifier based on methylation pattern showed that immortalized cells moved away from identity with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) benign samples towards TCGA breast cancer samples. Immortalization was associated with a modest accumulation of mutations and a modestly greater number of DNA copy number alterations than was observed in earlier passage cells but no evidence of general genomic instability. Immortal cells showed a large deletion at 10q13-15 and deletions at 10p11-15 and 17p11-13 that were associated with reduced expression of genes in those regions. Post-selection bulk cell populations are quite distinct from early passage cells, but are not direct precursors of the immortal cells as some DNA copy number alterations acquired by post-selection cells were not observed in the immortalized cells. Rather, in this instance, it is likely that post-selection cells established conditions conducive to the immortalization of a rare cell in the mix. This has implications for the development of tissue-based approaches for breast cancer risk stratification.']",

Recent studies showed that cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor proteins, such as p27 or p16, also induced cytoprotective autophagy in cancer cells.

In this study, we revealed that CDK4 inhibitor and a broad-range CDK inhibitor (flavopiridol) induced autophagy in some solid cancer cell lines, but not all. The autophagy induced by CDK4 inhibitors was observed in BT474, MDA-MB435S, SKBr3 (derived from breast cancer), A431 (derived from lung cancer) and SW480 (derived from colorectal cancer), While it was not observed in MCF7, MDA-MB231 (derived from breast cancer), NCI-N87 (derived from gastric cancer) and KMST-6 (derived from fibroblast). In the cell lines which were induced autophagy by CDK inhibitors, the combination of a CDK4 inhibitor and an autophagy inhibition, by either chloroquine or knockdown of ATG5 or BECN1, induced apoptosis.

From these results, the autophagy induced by CDK4 inhibitor mimic the stress-induced autophagy in some solid cancer cell lines.

However, few studies have quantified the level of cellular heterogeneity observed within an individual patient. This is significant because patients are often treated based upon expression of certain protein biomarkers, yet heterogeneous expression of these markers may affect the success of current targeted drug strategies. The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess intra-individual heterogeneity of standard clinical markers in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).Experimental Design', ' Thirty-eight breast cancer cases in which patients were concurrently diagnosed with DCIS and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) were used. Sequential sections from paraffin embedded tissue blocks were cut and immunostained with anti-ER, -PR, -HER-2, -Ki-67, -p16, -p53, and -p63 antibodies. Ten DCIS lesions from each patient were randomly selected and scored. Significant variation in IHC marker expression was defined by 20% of the lesions within an individual showing staining patterns that differed from the majority of lesions within that individual. Individuals were considered to display heterogeneity among DCIS lesions when at least 2/6 markers were classified as having significant variations in expression. In order to determine if the proportion of cases exhibiting variable expression for a single marker was higher than our hypothesized value of 10%, a one-sided exact binomial test was done at the 5% significance level.Results', ' Our results showed that PR, HER-2, Ki-67, and p16 displayed significant expression variations in DCIS lesions in individual patients in 21%, 58%, 47% and 61% of cases, respectively (P < 0.05 for PR; P < 1  108 for HER-2, Ki-67 and p16). In addition, seventy-one percent of individuals had heterogeneous expression in at least 2/6 markers (P < 1 x 1018). As previous studies indicated that DCIS displays four molecular subtypes, including luminal A, luminal B, HER2+, and basal-like, we further examined the heterogeneous status in regards to DCIS subtypes. As a result, 39.5% cases (15 out of 38) showed DCIS heterogeneity in molecular subtypes (P < 0.001). Interestingly, DCIS/IDC concurrent patients exhibiting more heterogeneity in DCIS seem more likely to have nodal involvement (P < 0.05).Conclusions', ' Our results quantitatively demonstrate for the first time that intra-individual heterogeneity in multi-lesional DCIS is common. Given that these results were from patients concurrently diagnosed with invasive and in situ ductal carcinoma, this could indicate that heterogeneity itself could be a predictor of subsequent development of IDC.This work was kindly supported by the FCCC Personalized Risk and Prevention Keystone, the Susan G.

Phytochemicals can interfere with cell-signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. -Tocotrienol is a natural form of vitamin E that displays a potent and selective anticancer activity against various mammary cell lines with no discernible toxicity toward normal cells. Sesamin is an abundant phytochemical in sesame seed oil which showed antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activity against human breast cancer cells. In addition, sesamin inhibits the metabolism of vitamin E isomers and increases their bioavailability and efficacy. Preliminary growth inhibition studies showed that combined treatment with subeffective doses of -tocotrienol and sesamin synergistically inhibited the growth of neoplastic murine +SA (ErbB2-positive) and human MCF-7 (luminal A, ER-positive) mammary epithelial cells, as determined by MTT assay and isobologram analysis. Additional studies were conducted to determine the intracellular mechanisms mediating the synergistic anticancer activity in +SA mammary epithelial cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that combined treatment of -tocotrienol and sesamin increased the percentage of cells in G1 phase as compared to the vehicle-treated control group. Western blot studies revealed that blockade in cell cycle progression is associated with decreased expression of cyclin D1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, phospho-Rb, and E2F1 transcription factor, and corresponding increase in levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor proteins, p27 and p16. Additional Western blot experiments showed that the combined -tocotrienol and sesamin treatment caused a marked decrease of ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 receptors phosphorylation. Furthermore, the combined low dose -tocotrienol and sesamin treatment was associated with a relatively large decrease in the intracellular levels of total or phosphorylated c-Raf, Mek1/2, Erk1/2, PI3K, PDK1, Akt, p-NF-B, Jak1, Jak2, and Stat1 as compared to all other treatment groups. Additional studies were conducted to investigate whether the growth inhibitory effects of the combined treatment is associated with a concomitant activation of apoptotic pathways. Results showed that the combined -tocotrienol and sesamin treatment did not activate early or late apoptosis events in the cell indicating that the inhibitory effects of the combined treatment are cytostatic, but not cytotoxic. In summary, these findings indicate that sesamin synergistically increases the anticancer effects of -tocotrienol, and combined treatment with these agents may provide some benefits in the treatment of breast cancer in women.

Two final transducer effectors of this pathway are the oncoproteins TAZ and VGLL1. In breast cancer, the expression of these two proteins occurs mainly in triple negative tumors. The aim of this study is to analyze the role of TAZ and VGLL1 in ovarian cancer (OC).  Methods', '   We studied a total of 212 FFPE samples belonging to the GEICO Early Stage (I-II) OC Registry. All cases were reviewed centrally by two independent pathologists after the evaluation of WT1, p53, p16, progesterone receptor and napsin A expression to confirm histological type. Final diagnosis was achieved by consensus and compared with diagnosis of origin (DO). TAZ and VGLL1 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (TMAs) and their impact on prognosis was analyzed by log-rank tests being relapse free survival (RFS) the clinical endpoint.  Results', '   OC were classified as following', ' high-grade serous (HGS, n = 44), low-grade serous (LGS, n = 23), high-grade endometrioid (HGE, n = 20), low-grade endometrioid (LGE, n = 48), clear cell (CCC, n = 50) and mucinous (M, n = 27). TAZ and VGLL1 were overexpressed in 30% and 9% of tumors, respectively. TAZ was expressed by 43% of HGS and 52% of CCC being negative in M (p < 0.001), whereas VGLL1 has not a significant histotype predilection (p = 0.08) being expressed in 20% of CCC. Concordance with DO was of 77% (Kappa = 0.722; p < 0.0001). Median follow-up was 87 months (range', ' 0-217) and 43 (20%) recurrences were reported. The univariate analysis showed a 5-years RFS of 67% for those cases expressing VGLL1 vs 85% of the negative (p = 0.038); a 73% for HGS and HGE vs. 88% of other histotypes (p = 0.001). TAZ expression was not reported as prognostically relevant. The multivariate analysis showed that higher stage [HR = 3.9 (1.4-10.6); p = 0.008], age > 55 yrs [HR = 2.1 (1.1-4.3); p = 0.03] and p53 expression [HR = 2.4 (1.2-4.8); p = 0.015] constituted independent poor prognostic factors.  Conclusions', '   This is the first study demonstrating the expression and the prognostic impact of TAZ and VGLL1 in OC. These results suggested an important role of the Hippo pathway, particularly in CCC.']",
