        "Meeting_name":" Inhibition of melanoma cell survival through p62/LC3B autophagic signaling",
        "Background":"['The primary objectives of this study were i) systematic evaluation of the differences in basal autophagic activity between melanocytes and malignant melanoma cells to determine whether these differences may be selectively targeted using the ROS inducer, Nexrutine (NX); ii) determination of NX selectivity in inhibiting melanoma cell survival and iii) specific involvement of autophagy signaling protein, SQSTM1/p62 in NX-mediated autophagic cell survival. NX is obtained from the bark of the cork tree, Phellodendron amurense. A panel of melanocyte and melanoma cells was evaluated for basal autophagy level and effect of NX treatment, including protein levels and turnover of p62 and LC3B (+/- CQ), and number of autophagic puncta per cell. Trypan blue, MTT, and Annexin V-APC were used to evaluate the effect of NX on cell death, proliferation and apoptosis. Genetic approach using siRNA for p62 and overexpression using HA-p62 followed by survival, proliferation, and autophagy measurements were used to further evaluate the possibility of p62 as a molecular target for inhibition of autophagy seen using NX. We found that i) melanoma cells displayed high autophagic flux compared with melanocytes, ii) NX treatment a) inhibited autophagy in melanoma cells, b) inhibited melanoma cell survival, and c) induced apoptosis in melanoma cells, iii) knockdown of p62 resulted in a lesser inhibition of cell viability and autophagy after NX treatment in high p62-expressing melanoma cells, and iv) overexpression of p62 sensitized low p62-expressing normal melanocytes and melanoma cells to NX-mediated cell death and autophagy inhibition, suggesting that p62 is a bonafide molecular target of NX. Overall, we show that Nexrutine is able to inhibit the inherent high level of pro-survival autophagy in melanoma cells, leading to loss of cell viability and induction of apoptosis, while melanocytes remain unaffected by NX at the same doses. Further, SQSTM1/p62 was found to be a critical mediator of the NX-mediated inhibition of autophagy and cell viability. This study demonstrates that NX maybe a promising novel, non-toxic agent for melanoma.Supported by R21 CA125719 & ACRCF (RG); NIDCR T32 DE14318/COSTAR (HGH)']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' While checkpoint blockade has shown promising survival benefits in patients with solid tumors, immune escape through loss of MHCI expression juxtaposed to an immunoregulatory milieu remain significant hurdles. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel treatment platform, which leverages the use of commercially available and clinically translatable nanoparticles (NPs) that can be combined with tumor-derived RNA to activate systemic immunity and re-program the intratumoral microenvironment from a regulatory into an immune activated locale. Methods', ' Since local vaccination strategies are mired with poor immunogenicity, we assessed if i.v. delivery of tumor-derived RNA encapsulated in lipophilic NPs could activate peripheral and intratumoral antigen presenting cells (APCs) for induction of therapeutic anti-tumor immunity in pre-clinical murine melanoma models. Results', ' We identified a clinically translatable NP formulation that when administered intravenously, mediates release of inflammatory cytokines (i.e. CCL2, IFN-alpha) into serum, systemically activates host APCs in reticuloendothelial organs, and induces precipitous upregulation of MHCI and immune activation markers (i.e. CD86) within the tumor microenvironment. Both model-antigen encoding RNA and physiologically-relevant tumor-derived RNA, when encapsulated in NPs, could expand potent anti-tumor T-cell immunity. We demonstrated that RNA-NPs harness the anti-viral defense mechanism against tumor antigens in a type I interferon dependent manner, and can be further engineered to deliver combinatorial therapies by co-encapsulating mRNAs encoding for immunomodulatory molecules (i.e. HCV PAMPs, GM-CSF). In a pre-clinical melanoma model, RNA-NPs mediate anti-tumor efficacy and significantly enhance activity of immune checkpoint mAbs when used in combination. Conclusions', ' By employing a systemic RNA-NP formulation encoding for both tumor RNAs and immunomodulatory molecules, as an innovative and versatile platform for delivering combinatorial therapeutics via a single treatment modality, this platform can be harnessed to simultaneously target tumor antigens and re-program the intratumoral microenvironment']",

        "Meeting_name":" Allelic-specific imbalance mapping identifies HDAC9 as a candidate susceptibility gene for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma",
        "Background":"['Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common cancer in the world. More than 3.5 million NMSCs were treated in 2006; of those, 700,000 were cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCC). There are several predisposing factors to cSCC; however, little is known about the genetic risk factors. Identification of genetic factors contributing to cSCC will enable the identification of those at risk and will lead to improved therapeutic options. A cSCC susceptibility locus, Skts5, was identified on mouse chromosome 12 by linkage analysis of F1 backcrosses between resistant Mus Spretus (Spret/GS) and susceptible Mus Musculus (NIH/Ola) mice. Other susceptibility loci identified in these crosses show preferential allelic imbalance in skin tumors, indicating that allele-specific somatic genetic alterations in these regions may be markers for cancer susceptibility loci. Skts5 spans a 14 megabase region with 65 coding elements. Based on sequence variations and differential gene expression between Spret/GS and NIH/Ola we were able to identify 11 candidate genes. The orthologous locus to Skts5 in humans maps to 7p21 and 7q31. Previous studies conducted in our lab show gains on 7p and 7q31 in 10% of cSCC tumors. An additional 3% of cSCC tumors were found to have copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. Further analysis revealed that microsatellite markers on 7p21 and 7q31 demonstrated preferential allelic imbalance in cSCC tumors. The question of this study is whether genetic variations at SKTS5 are playing a role in human cSCC susceptibility. We hypothesize that human cSCC tumors will show allele-specific somatic genetic changes at SKTS5 and that these alterations contribute to cSCC risk. In order to identify candidate genes at SKTS5, we performed genotyping of 70 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) encompassing our top mouse candidate genes using Sequenom MassARRAY. Three SNPs at SKTS5, two in HDAC9 (rs6959028 and rs12540872) and one in IFRD1 (rs2074796) showed statistically significant evidence of preferential allelic imbalance in cSCC tumors. Conversely, when SNPs were tested in two cSCC case/control collections no significant association for risk was seen. Because our study analyzed 40 SNPs in HDAC9 and two showed preferential allelic imbalance in tumors, we hypothesized that there might be HDAC9 haplotypes demonstrating preferential imbalance. We generated 4,5,6 and 7 marker haplotypes. Following multiple comparisons testing, significant haplotypes of each size containing rs6959028 and/or rs12540872 were identified with differential frequencies between normal blood and tumor DNA. From these studies our data identifies HDAC9 as a candidate gene for cSCC tumorigenesis. Risk with this locus needs to be further evaluated. Future studies will be needed to determine which HDAC9 SNPs are causal, as well as to identify the molecular mechanism(s) by which the variants contribute to cSCC.']",
