Chromosomal rearrangements resulting in kinase fusions have been described across the NTRK gene family, and may contribute to tumorigenesis in diverse clinical settings. We searched for potentially activating mutations in the NTRK gene family by applying biologically driven ranking criteria to an anonymized next-generation sequencing dataset, sourced from Foundation Medicine (FMI) and Compendia BioSciences (Compendia).  Methods', '  Approximately 10,000 patient samples were analyzed for mutations in NTRK1, NTRK2 or NTRK3. Mutation data in other known cancer-related genes were also captured for these tumors. Data were reconciled data across the disparate sources by mapping mutations to the canonical transcript for each gene where possible, or to a representative non-canonical transcript when the mutation occurred in a region not contained within the canonical transcript. Mutations were clustered together based on sequence proximity. Mutation groups were ranked by likelihood of oncogenic-activating potential using six biologically-driven component scores.  Results', '  732 distinct mutation clusters were identified across > 20 tumors. NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 represented 33%, 30% and 37%, respectively, of these mutation clusters. A disproportionate number of the most promising mutation clusters were in NTRK3', ' 59% of the top 5%, 58% of the top 10%, and 46% of the top 25%. In addition, the top 3 mutation clusters were in the NTRK3 kinase domain, and were observed in head and neck, lung, upper gastrointestinal, melanoma and colon cancers.  Conclusions', '  This heuristic identified mutations in the NTRK family, especially in NTRK3, that hold promise as oncogenic activating mutations. The highest ranked mutations deserve further study, as they are clonally present in the kinase domain, exist in the absence of other known oncogenic drivers, and are infrequent in germline databases.']",

        "Background":"[\"Gene rearrangements involving NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, ROS1 and ALK result in oncogenic fusion proteins that have been identified in many types of cancer, including lung, colorectal, salivary gland, sarcoma, papillary thyroid, glioblastoma, melanoma and other histologies. Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an orally available, highly potent and selective ATP-competitive pan-Trk, ROS1 and ALK inhibitor. In preclinical studies, entrectinib effectively inhibits target kinase activity and cancer cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth across various fusion partners and cancer types. More importantly, entrectinib's activity has been validated clinically in patients across multiple fusion partners and tissue histologies.Trk inhibitors, including entrectinib, have shown promising clinical activity in molecularly selected patients. Predictably, potential resistance mechanisms have also begun to emerge. For example, mutations in the Trk kinase domain were identified as one of the in vitro induced resistance mechanisms to the Trk inhibitor, Loxo-101. The three reported resistance mutations in the Ba/F3-MPRIP-NTRK1 cell line model treated with Loxo-101 were F589, G667 and V573. The F589 location on TrkA is equivalent to the gatekeeper mutations, L1196 location on ALK and L2026 location on ROS1. These gatekeeper mutations often arise as resistance mechanisms in patients treated with ALK and ROS1 inhibitors. To test the activity of entrectinib against these three reported NTRK1 mutations, we introduced mutated Trk proteins into Ba/F3 and cancer cell lines and performed dose-dependent proliferation studies. Entrectinib was able to inhibit proliferation of cells harboring each of these three mutations that confer resistance to other Trk inhibitors. Particularly, the IC50 values of entrectinib against kinase domain wildtype and gatekeeper mutated (F589) are essentially unchanged (low single-digit nM), which is consistent with the observation that entrectinib is also able to inhibit the gatekeeper mutation in ALK (L1196) in both cell based assays and in vivo tumor growth inhibition studies.In conclusion, our preclinical data suggest that entrectinib is an effective treatment for patients with NTRK-rearranged tumors, including cancers that harbor certain resistance mutations to other Trk inhibitors.\"]",

        "Background":"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults and comprises a heterogeneous group of diseases. A number of recurrent leukemogenic gene mutations or chromosomal rearrangements have been identified and clinically validated in AML. However, nearly 50% of AML patient samples lack any known AML driver mutations. Advances in molecular diagnostics have resulted in the identification of novel and actionable gene mutations or chromosomal rearrangements in these AML samples. The ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene is one such rearrangement identified in samples from patients with AML. Fusion of ETV6 sequences to the tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 results in constitutive activation of the TRKC kinase and ETV6-NTRK3 expression has emerged as one of the key oncodrivers for leukemogenesis. Constitutive activation of TRK family tyrosine kinases has also been detected in a wide range solid tumor and hematologic malignancies, including lung, colorectal, salivary gland, sarcoma, thyroid, glioblastoma, melanoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and Philadelphia-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an investigational, orally available, brain-penetrant, highly potent and selective kinase inhibitor with low nanomolar potency against TRKA/B/C, ROS1 and ALK kinase activities (encoded by NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 and ALK genes, respectively). In these studies, we have demonstrated sensitivity to entrectinib in AML cell lines with endogenous expression of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene. Entrectinib treatment blocked cell proliferation and survival in vitro with sub-nanomolar EC50 values. Phosphorylation of the ETV6-TRKC fusion protein as well as phosphorylation of known TRKC downstream signaling effectors was inhibited by entrectinib treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Sensitivity to entrectinib was dependent on expression of the TRKC fusion protein. In xenograft models, entrectinib treatment at clinically relevant doses resulted in tumor regression, which was accompanied by elimination of residual cancer cells from the bone marrow. The clinical relevance of activated oncogenic tyrosine kinases resulting from chromosomal rearrangements has been validated by the efficacy of selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Our preclinical data demonstrate the potential of entrectinib as an effective treatment for patients with NTRK rearranged acute myeloid leukemias and provide rationale for the clinical development of entrectinib in molecularly defined hematologic malignancies. Entrectinib is currently the subject of an ongoing global Phase 2 basket study enrolling patients across multiple tumor histologies containing TRK, ROS1 or ALK fusions.']",

        "Background":"['Neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinases (NTRKs), or Tropomyosin receptor kinases (Trks), belong to a family of tyrosine kinases that regulate synaptic strength and plasticity during neural development. Deregulated kinase activity of Trk family members due to chromosomal rearrangements, gene mutations, splice variants and overexpression has been shown to be associated with cancer cell proliferation, survival, invasion and chemo-resistance in a number of cancer types. For example, chromosomal rearrangements involving NTRK1-3 have been reported in lung, colorectal, papillary thyroid, glioblastoma, melanoma and other cancers, and have been demonstrated to function as oncogenic drivers in these tumors. Moreover, overexpression of TrkA, TrkB and/or their corresponding ligands has been observed in a number of solid tumors such as breast, lung, prostate and pancreatic cancers. However, the functional implication of Trk overexpression has not been well defined or fully explored as a potential therapeutic strategy.To characterize the expression, signaling and function of full-length Trks in cancer, a series of stable cell lines with full-length NTRK genes were established. The engineered cell lines were characterized for Trk expression, Trk phosphorylation and their response to ligand stimulation. Moreover, cell proliferation, cell transformation and growth inhibition by RXDX-101, a clinical stage, potent and selective pan-Trk inhibitor, were assessed. Trk downstream effectors, such as PLC, AKT and ERK, were also evaluated in the relevant settings. Furthermore, several cancer cell lines with endogenous overexpression of full-length Trks or rearranged Trks were identified and functionally characterized.Our studies highlight the similarities and differences between Trk rearrangement and overexpression as potential oncogenic drivers and support further exploration of RXDX-101 in cancers with Trk overexpression.']",

        "Background":"['Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignant tumor in adults. About half of patients with uveal melanoma will develop metastatic disease to the liver and the lung. These tumors are characterized by mutations in G-proteins (GNAQ and GNA11), activation of MAPK, and over-expression of c-Met. We have previously reported that c-Met inhibition inhibits tumor cell invasion and metastasis formation in uveal melanoma. Altiratinib is a selective inhibitor for c-Met as well as TIE2, VEGFR2 and TRK kinases. We found that this agent had no effect on inhibiting cell growth, consistent with our previous findings with crizotinib. However, it did inhibit invasion of uveal melanoma cells through matrigel in a concentration dependent fashion (25 nM to 250 nM) with inhibition of phospho-Met noted at concentrations as low as 25 nM. Selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, is currently in clinical trial in patients with this disease. We found that treatment with 250 nM selumetinib inhibited cell proliferation but unexpectedly induced a marked increase in cell invasion of GNAQ and GNA11 mutant cell lines. This was associated with an increase in c-Met RNA and protein expression, as well as receptor phosphorylation, after 24 hours of selumetinib treatment. Combining selumetinib with altiratinib inhibited cell invasion to the level of altiratinib alone and continued to inhibit cell proliferation to the level of selumetinib alone. This effect was recapitulated by the knockdown of c-Met by siRNA prior to treatment with selumetinib. In a uveal melanoma xenograft model, the combination treatment of 15 mg/kg altiratinib and 25 mg/kg selumetinib significantly delayed tumor growth compared to vehicle control, altiratinib and selumetinib alone. Western blot analysis of tumor tissue confirmed target inhibition of p-Met and p-ERK in animals treated with altiratinib and selumetinib, respectively. Furthermore, tumor metastasis was inhibited by altiratinib, selumetinib and combination treatments in a uveal melanoma mouse model. These results indicate that the combined inhibition of MEK and c-Met by selumetinib and altiratinib, respectively, may be sufficient to suppress uveal melanoma tumor growth and metastasis. This strategy can potentially be used as therapy for patients with primary uveal melanoma who are at high risk for the development of metastatic disease.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma and malignant pheochromocytoma are known for high MYC expression. MYCN amplification and its over-expression are associated with the worst neuroblastoma disease outcome. Meta-iodo-benzylguanidine (MIBG) is a norepinephrine analogue and a mitochondrial respiration inhibitor. 131I-MIBG has been used for scintigraphic detection of neural crest derived tumors (neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma and melanoma) that specifically uptake MIBG by norepinephrine transporters (NET). 131I-MIBG is also used for targeted radiotherapy of neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma. Non-radiolabeled MIBG had been reported to be cytotoxic to neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism of its growth suppressive effect was not elucidated. Our previous studies showed that FCCP, a well-known mitochondrial respiration inhibitor, destabilized MYCN and MYC in neuroblastoma cells and caused growth suppression. In this study we confirmed that MIBG suppressed growth of neuroblastoma cell lines (SKNBE(2)C, IMR5, Nb69, and SKNAS), and its growth suppressive effect in each cell line correlated with NET expression in these cells. In addition, MIBG suppressed growth of neuroblastoma stem cells derived from SKNBE(2)C. MIBG treatment of SKNBE(2)C and SKNAS resulted in an increase expression of growth suppressive gene (GADD45B) and genes encoding for biomarkers of favorable neuroblastoma (CD44, EPHB6, EFNB2, EFNB3, NTRK1). Treatment of MYCN amplified (SKNBE(2)C, IMR5) and non-MYCN amplified (Nb69, SKNAS) neuroblastoma cells with MIBG resulted in marked reduction of MYCN and MYC expression, respectively in dose and time dependent fashions. Collectively, our studies suggest that MIBG not only targets neural crest derived tumors, but also is a MYCN/MYC destabilizing agent.']",

Low baseline levels of ANG2, sTie-2, HGF and IL-8 were associated with greater tumor shrinkage and prolonged PFS whereas high baseline levels of VEGF and sVEGFR3 were associated with greater tumor shrinkage.    Conclusions', '  Lenvatinib administered orally at a dose of 24 mg once daily to patients with MTC is associated with manageable toxicity and a RR of 36%, identifying lenvatinib as a promising new potential therapeutic agent for treating patients affected with this disease.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Plasma cell-free (cf) DNA from cancer patients offers an easily obtainable and repeatedly applicable source of DNA for mutation analysis, which provides attractive alternative to tumor tissue testing. Novel ultrasensitive multiplex technologies using small amounts of DNA are needed for further implementation of plasma cfDNA testing in personalized therapy.Methods', ' We have developed an ultra-deep next-generation sequencing method for somatic BRAF mutation detection in 5 ng of cfDNA with high sensitivity and specificity, which was expanded to include 30 (full exon tiling', ' ERBB2, TP53, FGFR1, PTEN, MET, KRAS, ALK, CTNNB1, KIT, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, EGFR, MAP2K1, PIK3R1, DDR2, NF1, MITF, AKT3, PHLPP1, HGF, HOXD8, MEK2, hotspot containing exons', ' AKT1, HRAS, GNA11, GNAQ, RAC1; copy number variations', ' ERBB2, FGFR1, MET, BRAF, EGFR, MITF, HGF, HOXD8; gene fusions', ' RET1, ROS, and ALK) and then 58 common cancer related genes (previous panel + APC, AR, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR-4, SMO, FBXW7, NOTCH1, CDKN2B, IDH1, IDH2, GNAS, KDR, STK11, ESR1, VHL, ATM, CDH1, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, TSC1, TSC2, Fltr3, FOXL2, CDKN2A, PDGFRA, IGF1R). Each cfDNA fragment was uniquely barcoded and amplified prior to Illumina target enrichment workflow, followed by ultra-deep sequencing (>10,000X). Proprietary data processing and analysis tools were developed to enable sensitive detection of rare mutant molecules over high wild-type background (detection of 1 in 1,000 - 10,000 molecules). Results were compared to mutation analysis of archival primary or metastatic tumor tissue obtained at different points of clinical care from a CLIA-certified laboratory.Results', ' Initially, cfDNA was extracted from plasma samples of 24 patients with advanced cancers (melanoma, n = 9; colorectal, n = 5; non-small cell lung, n = 2; papillary thyroid, n = 2; other cancers, n = 6) and 5ng were used for BRAF mutation analysis. BRAF mutations were detected in 71% (17/24) of plasma samples and in 88% (21/24) of archival tumor samples, resulting in concordance in 87% (20/24) of cases. Subsequently, we extracted plasma samples from additional 13 patients with advanced cancers (colorectal, n = 4; melanoma, n = 3; other cancers, n = 6) and tested 14-30ng of cfDNA for the presence of alterations in 30 to 58 cancer related genes. Both ultra-deep sequencing of plasma cfDNA and standard tissue sequencing detected median of 2 alterations per patient and dominant oncogenic alterations previously detected in the tumor tissue were also found in plasma cfDNA. Additional 80 samples are being analyzed and results will be presented at the meeting.Conclusions', ' Detecting common oncogenic alterations using ultra-deep sequencing of plasma cfDNA is feasible with an acceptable level of concordance with testing of tumor tissue and should be further investigated for testing in patients with advanced cancer.']",
