Tumors harboring ALK and ROS1 rearrangements are highly sensitive to crizotinib whereas RET inhibitors may be of potential benefit for the treatment for RET-fusion positive tumors1. Current methods for detection of ALK, ROS1, and RET rearrangements involve fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), immunohistochemistry (IHC) or RT-PCR, each test offering its own advantages and disadvantages, and making it difficult for screening large numbers of patient samples for all three targetable fusions.To explore screening modalities for the simultaneous detection of ALK, ROS1 and RET fusions from a single analyte, we designed a multiplexed, transcript-based assay to detect for presence or absence of fusions. Utilizing a combined 3 over-expression and fusion-specific detection strategy, we developed a single-tube multiplex assay with a quantitative scoring modality that is highly sensitive, reproducible and capable of detecting low abundant ALK, ROS1 and RET fusion transcripts. We successfully validated the assay in 273 NSCLC specimens. For ALK, our results were highly concordant (97.4%) to prior results obtained by IHC (n=189). We confirmed ROS1 (n=7) and RET (n=11) fusion-positive tumors by RT-PCR plus sequencing. There is a significant enrichment for ROS1 and RET fusions in triple negative NSCLC (i.e. KRAS/EGFR/ALK wildtype) (Table 1). ALK, ROS1, RET, KRAS and EGFR mutations are mutually exclusive in this study.

Methods', ' Between December 2013 and December 2014, we screened 708 NSCLC patients using reverse transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay and correlated ROS1 rearrangement status with clinical features. EGFR mutation was detected by DNA sequencing or ARMS. KRAS mutation and ALKrearrangement were tested by DNA sequencing and FISH respectively.  Results', ' Of 708 NSCLC patients, ROS1 rearrangements were detected in 11 cases (1.6%).There was no significant difference in age (P= 0.74), gender (P= 0.54), stage (I-IIIA vs. IIIB-IV P= 0.74), histology (adenocarcinoma vs non-adenocarcinoma, P= 0.99) or T status (T0-2 vs. T3-4, P= 0.23) between patients with ROS positive and negative NSCLC.

        "Background":"[\"Genomic rearrangements that fuse kinase domain-containing 3 regions of tyrosine kinase genes with 5 regions of unrelated genes are well characterized in cancer. The resulting fusion proteins often drive proliferation and invasion of tumor cells and thus represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. One such kinase that has been demonstrated to be involved in various genomic rearrangement events in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), glioblastoma, and cholangiocarcinoma is the ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinase (also known as c-ROS and ROS). To date, three different 5 fusion partners for ROS1 have been identified. In this study, we examined the frequency of ROS1 gene rearrangement in a panel of 428 patient-derived NSCLC tumor samples using a break-apart FISH assay. We found that approximately 1.2% of samples were positive. In positive samples, the expression of the fusion gene and the identity of the fusion partner were examined. HCC78 is a NSCLC cell line that has been demonstrated by us and others to express the SLC34A2-ROS1 gene fusion. In order to assess the cellular consequences of ROS1 inhibition, we treated HCC78 cells with two distinct small molecule kinase inhibitors that have activity against ROS1 (crizotinib and TAE684). We found that both drugs inhibited proliferation of HCC78 cells, down-regulated signaling pathways known to control cellular growth and survival, and disrupted normal cell-cycle progression. Finally, we report clinical data from a NSCLC patient with a ROS1 gene rearrangement, as detected by the FISH break-apart assay, who demonstrated tumor shrinkage when treated with crizotinib. This patient's tumor exhibited a novel ROS1 gene fusion partner. In conclusion, genomic rearrangements involving the ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinase are present in a small subset of NSCLC patients, and drugs that target ROS1 may be an effective treatment strategy for these patients.\"]",

These translocations, activating a proto-oncogene with a tyrosine kinase domain, are also targeted by the MET and ALK crizotinib. ROS1 rearrangements are found in only 1.2-1.7% NSCLCs, but seemingly only in triple negative (EGFR and KRAS non-mutated and ALK non-rearranged) adenocarcinomas and preferentially in non- or light smokers.  Methods', '  60 triple negative non- or light-smoking patients with lung adenocarcinoma were screened for ROS1 rearrangements by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Two commercially available break-apart FISH probe kits containing a mixture of two probes hybridizing on each side of the ROS1 locus, one located in a centromeric (3) position, and the other one in a telomeric (5) position relative to the ROS1 gene were used. ROS1 fusions were therefore detected without any preconception on the fusion partner, as multiple fusion partners have been described. At least 100 nuclei were screened, and a tumor was considered positive if it contained more than 15% rearranged nuclei.  Results', '  Forty-nine of the 60 tumors were interpretable. Four (8.2%) of theses 49 tumors were ROS1 rearranged by FISH. Only one of the positive cases showed a classical split rearrangement pattern (one fusion, one green and one red signal in more than 15% of nuclei), whereas the three other tumors showed a variant pattern, with a deletion of the telomeric probe, located in a 5 position relative to the ROS1 gene locus, indicating the presence of a fusion partner upstream of the ROS1 gene. The four positive cases were all at an advanced stage (3 or 4), but did not display any common architectural feature.  Conclusions', '  The prevalence of ROS1 positivity in our selected population was far superior (8.2%) to that of a non-selected NSCLC population, suggesting that this type of screening may be more effective (faster and more cost-worthy) to detect ROS1 positive tumors.']",

NSCLC are subdivided in clinically relevant molecular subsets according to a classification based on specific so-called oncogenic driver mutations.Recently, ROS1 gene rearrangement was identified in 1-2% of NSCLC resulting in the formation of fusion proteins in which the kinase domain of ROS1 is constitutively active. Targeting ROS1 proteins with crizotinib is showing promise as an effective therapy in ROS1-positive patients. The diagnostic test for ROS1 rearrangement is currently done on tumor biopsies or fine-needle aspirations. We evaluated whether ROS1 rearrangement could be detected and monitored using circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in ROS1-positive patients treated by crizotinib. Patients and Methods', 'Blood samples were drawn in four ROS1-positive patients at baseline and different time-points under crizotinib treatment as well as in four ROS1-negative (ALK-positive) patients. CTC enrichment was performed by filtration (ISET, isolation by size of epithelial tumor cells). ROS1 gene alterations were examined in CTCs by combining four-color immunofluorescent staining and FA-FISH (filter-adapted fluorescent in situ hybridization) according to a method we recently reported (Pailler et al, J Clin Oncol. 2013) and compared with those present in tumor biopsies. Chromosomal instability (CIN) present in CTCs was characterized using multi color FA-FISH and DNA image cytometry.Results', 'All ROS1-positive patients had high levels (>20 CTCs/3ml) of ROS1-rearranged CTCs. ROS1-rearranged CTCs consistently harbored high numbers of native ROS1 copies and a 35 split contrasting with ROS1 gene patterns present within the corresponding tumors. A high level of cell-to-cell variability in ROS1 pattern abnormalities gene was observed in CTCs of ROS1-positive patients. Experiments are ongoing to characterize the CIN status of CTCs using both FA-FISH and DNA image cytometry in ROS1-positive patients. Changes in the levels of ROS1-rearranged CTCs were observed during crizotinib treatment.ConclusionROS1 rearrangement can be detected in CTCs of patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC by using a filtration technique and FA-FISH combined with immunofluorescence staining, enabling both diagnostic testing and monitoring of crizotinib treatment. The high rate of cell-to-cell variability in ROS1 pattern abnormalities and tumor heterogeneity observed in ROS1-rearranged CTCs suggests that aneuploidy and genetic instability might have an important role in tumorigenesis of ROS1-positive NSCLC.']",

        "Background":"['Approximately 7% of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) harbor oncogenic fusions involving ALK, ROS1, and RET. While tumors harboring ALK fusions are highly sensitive to crizotinib, emerging data have demonstrated that individuals with ROS1 or RET fusions may also benefit from inhibitors targeting these two kinases. A new oncogenic fusion involving NTRK1 that can be targeted by kinase inhibitors has been recently described. The two main methods to identify translocations, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) are labor intensive and sensitivity is rather low. Common sample types for lung cancer analysis are biopsies making the study of more than one fusion gene rather difficult. In this study we aimed to develop and validate a workflow based on AmpliSeq technology to comprehensively profile ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK1 chromosomal translocations in lung tumors. Two hundred lung cancer retrospective samples, including tumor biopsy, were collected from 12 laboratories - the OncoNetwork Consortium. All the samples were previously characterized by orthologous techniques (FISH, IHC, RT-PCR and/or MassArray). More than 30 ALK positive samples were selected. The panel targets over 70 fusion transcripts associated with ALK, RET, ROS1, and NTRK1 genes. The panel also includes 5 and 3 gene expression assays for each gene as indicators of a translocation event and assays for 5 internal control genes. The workflow is compatible with formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue, requiring only 10ng of total RNA and able to multiplex up to 16 libraries on a single Ion 318 chip. A dedicated data analysis pipeline using the Ion Reporter software 4.2 was evaluated. Serial dilutions of cell lines RNA harboring known fusion events, in normal RNA showed that the methodology had 1% mutant RNA limit of detection. A second dilution experiment using RNA extracted from FFPE lung fusion positive samples diluted in a negative FFPE sample showed a detection limit of 15%. The use of a common control fusion positive RNA samples among all the consortia laboratories showed 100% reproducibility. Concordance study was performed using 200 FFPE samples previously characterized with standard method. A concordance of >98% was obtained between the methodologies. The discordant results are currently under study. A negative FFPE samples was run as single test on an Ion 318 chip on to evaluate the possibility of false positive results due to high number of reads. No false positive was detected in this experiment. In this study we present a workflow that provides a robust, reproducible and accurate comprehensive genetic screening tool well suited for FFPE lung tumor biopsies, in a fast and cost-efficient manner. This may provide a valuable tool for reducing turn-around-time and expense in lung cancer analysis.']",

        "Background":"['ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the Insulin Receptor family. It was originally identified in glioblastoma where it is involved in a chromosomal rearrangement that generates an oncogenic FIG-ROS1 fusion gene. More recently, through the application of advanced genomic approaches a series of new chromosomal rearrangements involving ROS1 gene have been identified in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) tumors. The fusion genes that have been characterized to date, such as for example SCL34A2-ROS1, result in expression of chimeric proteins endowed with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. As already observed for ALK, the ROS positive patient population (ca 1% of NSCLC) is characterized by specific features', ' all tumors are adenocarcinoma and patients tend to be non-smokers and younger that the median age of NSCLC patients.NMS-E628 is an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of ALK kinase activity that is currently being evaluated in phase I/II clinical study. In preclinical models, NMS-E628 potently and selectively inhibits the in vitro and in vivo growth of ALK-driven tumors, with confirmed mechanism of action. Since NMS-E628 is able to pass the blood-brain barrier, the compound was also tested for efficacy in an intracranial xenograft model with ALK positive NSCLC tumors. MRI imaging demonstrated that NMS-E628 was able to effectively and dose-dependently control the growth of these intracranial tumors, leading to increased survival.Due to the structural similarity between ALK and ROS1 kinases, the activity of NMS-E628 on ROS1 was evaluated in biochemical and cellular assays. The compound was found to be a potent, ATP competitive inhibitor of ROS1 (IC50 7 nM). This biochemical potency translates into inhibition of the proliferation of HCC-78, a NSCLC cell line characterized by ROS1-driven activated signaling, due to the presence of the SCL34A2-ROS1 fusion gene. To further characterize the compound in cells, an activated form of ROS1 was expressed in Ba/F3 cells generating an IL3-independent, ROS1-driven tumor model. NMS-E628 strongly inhibits the proliferation of Ba/F3-ROS1 cells in vitro with confirmed dose-dependent decrease of ROS1 phosphorylation. When tested in vivo, the compound was found to induce complete tumor regression after 10-day continuous treatment in nude mice bearing established Ba/F3-ROS1 tumors.Taken together, these data indicate that NMS-E628 might represent a valid therapeutic opportunity for patients bearing ROS1-dependent tumors.']",

Promising clinical responses have been observed in patients bearing tumors with ROS1 fusions treated with Xalkori, an ALK/MET kinase inhibitor that also inhibits Ros1. However, resistance has been observed and a ROS1 kinase domain mutation, G2032R, was identified in a ROS1 fusion positive NSCLC patient who developed resistance to Xalkori treatment. Clinical experience with other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors suggests that additional resistance mutations are likely to arise, highlighting the need for therapeutic agents that can overcome this type of resistance.We identified a novel chemical series of potent and selective Ros1 inhibitors with a unique DFG-out binding mode. The structure of human Ros1 in a complex with a ligand from this chemical class was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Here we describe the structure-activity relationships and synthesis route for this chemical series. A representative compound from this series inhibited isolated recombinant Ros1 kinase activity with an IC50 of approximately 30 nM. This compound inhibited less than 6% of kinases in a panel of 400 at 1 M concentration. Growth of Ba/F3 cells engineered to express Ros1 autophosphorylation in HCC78 NSCLC cells that harbor a SLC34A2-ROS1 fusion were inhibited at similar concentrations as the isolated protein.

This compound was also active on Ba/F3 cells containing Ros1 with a mutation in the gatekeeper residue, L2026M, in cell growth assays in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, this unique binding mode provides scope for activity on additional Ros1 mutations that confer resistance to Xalkori, such as the clinically relevant G2032R mutation.

However, the FDA-approved ALK FISH assay is technically challenging, with failures due to pre-analytic variables. Another approach, intragenic differential expression (IDE), detects translocations by comparing expression levels of the 5 end with the 3 end of target gene transcripts. In this study we developed and evaluated a rapid IDE assay to screen for ALK, ROS1, and RET translocations, independent of the fusion partner.METHODS', ' A total of 419 samples (408 randomly-selected NSCLC clinical samples, ALK positive and ROS1 positive cell lines (2 each), and 7 previously-tested RET-positive clinical samples) were used to develop and evaluate performance characteristics of the IDE assays. To determine IDE scores, levels of ALK, ROS1, and RET expression were first determined by quantitative RT-PCR measurement of the 5- and 3- ends of the respective transcripts. The differences in expression levels were calculated as Ct (Ct5 - Ct3). High Ct values indicate presumptive presence of gene translocations. 212/408 NSCLC samples were analyzed by ALK FISH and EML4-ALK RT-PCR, and 196/408 samples were analyzed by EML4-ALK RT-PCR.RESULTS', ' Thirty-one of the 408 (7.6%) clinical samples tested positive for ALK rearrangements by IDE. Among them, 20 were confirmed by FISH and/or EML4-ALK (true positive, 64.5%), while 11 were negative by FISH and/or EML4-ALK (false positive, 35.5%). One of 10 ALK FISH positive samples tested negative by both ALK IDE and EML4-ALK RT-PCR analysis (false negative), while one of 202 FISH-negative sample tested positive by both EML4-ALK and ALK IDE. ALK IDE exhibited 94.5% (189/200) concordance with ALK FISH and 96.0% (356/371) concordance with the EML4-ALK assay. For ROS1, both ROS1-positive cell lines and 4/408 (1.0%) NSCLC samples tested positive for ROS1 by IDE. Among the 4 IDE-positive NSCLC samples, 1 was confirmed by ROS1 FISH. For RET, all 7 known positives and 10/408 (2.5%) NSCLC samples tested positive by IDE. Three of six RET IDE positive NSCLC samples were confirmed by RET FISH. Overall, ALK, ROS1, and RET translocations were mutually exclusive in NSCLC patients. The lung IDE assay had a failure rate of 3.7%.CONCLUSION', ' These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using IDE to detect ALK, ROS1, and RET gene translocations.

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with ALK and ROS1 rearrangements, the emergence of mutations in the targeted oncogenes was identified as one of the mechanisms that confer drug resistance. In particular, a group of mutations known as solvent front mutations, such as ALKG1202R and ROS1G2032R, render common resistance to ALK and ROS1 inhibitors. Similar solvent front mutations, such as TRKAG595R and TRKCG623R, have also been identified in cancer patients with rearrangement of NTRK family genes who developed resistance to TRK-targeted therapies. TPX-0005, a compact three-dimensional macrocyclic molecule, was designed to completely locate at the adenine binding site of ATP in order to efficiently target the active kinase conformation and systematically circumvent the steric interference from various clinical resistant mutations, especially the solvent front mutations. TPX-0005 is an orally available and potent ATP-competitive inhibitor against ALK, ROS1, TRKA, TRKB and TRKC recombinant kinases and their corresponding clinical resistant mutants. TPX-0005 demonstrated potent anti-proliferative activity in the range of sub-nanomolar to low nanomolar in a number of human cancer cell lines and engineered stable cell lines expressing the targeted oncogenes or their solvent front mutants, accompanied by inhibition of target phosphorylation and concomitant inactivation of downstream effectors such as ERK, AKT and STAT3. In patient derived xenograft tumor models, TPX-0005 treatment resulted in significant regression of tumors harboring the oncogenic ALK, ROS1 and TRKC fusions. Moreover, in a series of mouse xenograft tumor models, TPX-0005 exhibited marked anti-tumor activity not only in tumors harboring the wildtype oncogenic targets but also in tumors harboring the oncogenes with the solvent front mutations via inhibition of the target phosphorylation. Taken together, these pre-clinical studies have demonstrated the potent activities of TPX-0005 against not only wild type oncogenic ALK, ROS1, TRK fusions but also their corresponding solvent front mutations, which will bring in a new therapy for cancer patients resistant to currently available ALK, ROS1, and TRK inhibitors in clinic.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' ALK and ROS1 rearrangements are common gene alterations found in subsets of patients with NSCLC. Identification of ALK and ROS1 rearrangement in NSCLC is critical for highly active targeted therapies aiming for these two main tumorigenic drivers. Due to the similarity of tyrosine kinase domains between ALK and ROS1, many ALK inhibitors are also functional in treatment of ROS1 subtype NSCLC. For example, crizotinib, which is a standard therapy for advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC is highly effective in advanced ROS1-rearranged genotype NSCLC patients. The mutational analysis of these genes requires serial tumor biopsying from primary lesions, which requires high risk clinical procedures. Further, the current tissue-based diagnostics, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) are known to be challenging technically with limited sensitivity, subjective interpretation and inaccuracy in monitoring the current tumor status. The TR-CytoTrapNanoTM CTC technology is a blood-based assay to utilize CTCs as a biosource for mRNA extraction to detect genetic alteration or gene expression profiles including ALK and ROS1 gene rearrangements. In this study, we determined the variant specific expression of ALK fusion transcripts (EML4-ALK, KIF-ALK, and TGF-ALK) and ROS1 fusion transcripts (EZR-ROS1, SDC4-ROS1, TPM3-ROS1, LRIG3-ROS1, GOPC-ROS1, CD74-ROS1, and SLC34A2-ROS1) using multiplex digital droplet polymerase chain reaction(ddPCR) technology.']",

However, despite crizotinib has shown remarkable initial responses, cancers eventually develop resistance to crizotinib. In a recent report of a clinical resistance to crizotinib, G2032R mutation in ROS1 kinase domain was identified, which is analogous to the G1202R mutation found in crizotinib-resistant ALK-rearranged lung cancers. To further identify the mechanism of resistance to crizotinib in ROS1 fusion positive NSCLC, we established a model of acquired resistance by ENU mutagenesis screening using CD74-ROS1 addicted Ba/F3 cell line models. As the results, we identified several novel crizotinib resistance mutations including G2032R mutation. To overcome the resistance, we performed the drug screening with small molecular inhibitors, and identified several inhibitors including Foretinib, cMET/VEGFR inhibitor, effectively inhibit the survival of CD74-ROS1 expressing cells. Furthermore, we also identified that some of those inhibitors can overcome the resistance caused by G2032R mutation.

To overcome mutation-based resistance, AP26113 was designed to maintain activity against crizotinib-resistant ALK variants such as the gatekeeper ALK mutant L1196M. In an ongoing phase 1 dose-escalation study, AP26113 has achieved steady-state trough concentrations in excess of 1 M and demonstrated promising clinical activity in both crizotinib-resistant and nave ALK-positive NSCLC patients and preliminary evidence of activity in patients with mutant EGFR (#439O, ESMO 2012). To further assess the activity of AP26113 against crizotinib-resistant ALK mutants, and the structurally related ROS1 fusions recently identified in NSCLC, we engineered Ba/F3 cells to express the appropriate oncogenic drivers and evaluated their sensitivities to crizotinib and AP26113.Ba/F3 cell lines expressing clinically-identified EML4-ALK mutants (T1151T insertion, S1206Y, D1203N, L1196M, G1202R, F1174C and C1156Y) had substantially reduced sensitivity to crizotinib (viability IC50= 363-1296 nM) compared with native EML4-ALK (IC50= 137 nM). These data are consistent with the identification of these mutants in patients with acquired crizotinib resistance. AP26113 potently inhibited both native (IC50= 21 nM) and crizotinib-resistant ALK mutants (IC50= 26-254 nM) at concentrations substantially below the clinically achievable trough levels of AP26113 (1 M), suggesting it may possess a pan-ALK inhibitory profile.AP26113 also effectively inhibited the viability of Ba/F3 cells expressing CD74-ROS1 (IC50= 18 nM), FIG-ROS1 (IC50= 31 nM), SDC4-ROS1 (IC50= 16 nM) and EZR-ROS1 (IC50= 41 nM) thus demonstrating that it is an equipotent inhibitor of ALK and ROS1. In a Ba/F3 CD74-ROS1 xenograft model, AP26113 inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner, with 50 mg/kg AP26113 inducing substantial tumor regression. Since ROS1 and ALK are structurally related and similarly sensitive to crizotinib, we reasoned that acquired drug resistance in ROS1-driven tumors may also occur via mutation. We therefore generated Ba/F3 cells driven by L2026M gatekeeper mutant forms of CD74-ROS1 and FIG-ROS1 and tested their drug sensitivity. Interestingly, the inhibitory capacity of AP26113 was unaffected by L2026M. In contrast, crizotinib potencies were reduced approximately 4-fold.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that AP26113 inhibits clinically relevant crizotinib- resistant ALK mutants and oncogenic ROS1 fusions recently identified in NSCLC irrespective of the fusion partner. Importantly, since AP26113 maintains potent activity against mutant forms of ALK and ROS1 at concentrations substantially below its human trough concentrations these data suggest that AP26113 may be able to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant mutants in NSCLC patients.']",

        "Background":"['Targeted drugs have been widely used in the treatment of lung cancer, especially for non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. NCCN guideline lists multiple drugs which are particularly effective in the subgroup of patients with specific gene mutation variants, including the fusion transcripts of ALK, ROS1 and RET, and the mutations of EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and HER2. Multiple techniques have been developed to detect fusion transcripts in tumor samples, such as FISH, IHC and PCR assays. FISH is the most accurate method for fusion detection currently. The split probe FISH assay, which does not require the pre-knowledge of what is the fusion partner with ALK for example, can detect unknown ALK fusion products as well. However, it fails to identify which gene is fused with ALK (or other oncogene) in the chimera products, therefore is not informative for the mechanism or drug resistance study. In addition, due to the limitation on the fluoresce dye, it is quite difficult to multiplex fusion FISH probes for different genes into one assay.We describe here a next generation sequencing assay to detect a panel of fusion transcripts and mutations in one single assay. Our single assay can detect the fusion products of ALK, ROS1 and RET with any known or unknown fusion partners, together with the hotspot mutations in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and HER2. Our assay can identify not only the exact sequence of the unknown fusion partners, but also any mutations within the full coding regions of ALK, ROS1 and RET. This information is critical for the resistance mechanism study and the next generation inhibitor drug development, since about half of the ALK inhibitor resistance was caused by the mutations in ALK gene itself. We have identified a novel ALK fusion gene with a never-reported fusion partner in a lung cancer patient. The xenograft model derived from this patient responds to crizotinib well in the in vivo study (published on Journal of Thoracic Oncology). We have demonstrated that our assay can reliably detect both the novel fusion and the well known EML4-ALK fusion from only 1-2 5um FFPE slides of the lung tumor tissues, together with other possible fusions and mutations as well.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

        "Background":"['The use of kinase inhibitors directed at dominant oncogenes has proven a successful treatment strategy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring ALK gene fusions, but intrinsic or acquired drug resistance limits clinical benefit. We recently identified a novel class of oncogenes generated by translocations of the NTRK1 gene, which encodes the TRKA receptor tyrosine kinase. ROS1 and RET gene fusions represent additional oncogene targets in lung cancer and gene fusion positive tumors currently comprise 10% of lung adenocarcinomas. Previous results from our laboratory have demonstrated that EGFR signaling can mediate both intrinsic and acquired resistance in a ROS1+ NSCLC cell line. We asked whether EGFR might play a common role in other NSCLC cell lines harboring gene fusions with the aim of developing combination therapies that may delay drug resistance to oncogene-targeted kinase inhibitors in these tumors. We have observed high protein expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in NSCLC cell lines positive for ALK (H3122, H2228, and STE-1), ROS1 (HCC78 and CUTO-2), RET (LC-2/Ad), and NTRK1 gene fusions (CUTO-3), and in a NTRK1 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. We observed increased inhibition of downstream signaling and in vitro cellular proliferation with the addition of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in these gene fusion positive cell lines. Furthermore, stimulation of EGFR with EGF rescues targeted inhibition with oncogene-specific kinase inhibitors in the critical downstream signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK. Inhibition of cellular proliferation of these cell lines using oncogene-specific kinase inhibitors was also rescued by stimulation of EGFR. Interestingly, we observed transactivation of the TRKA and RET kinase domains by EGFR stimulation in the CUTO-3 and LC-2/Ad cell lines, respectively, despite treatment with a TRKA or RET kinase inhibitor. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that EGFR and the chimeric protein RIP-TRKA (encoded by the fusion gene MPRIP-NTRK1) associate in the CUTO-3 cells or when ectopically expressed in 293T cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate a critical role for EGFR in gene fusion positive lung cancer and suggest that signaling via this receptor may provide a survival mechanism for cancer cells treated with an oncogene-specific kinase inhibitor. Further investigation of EGFR inhibition in addition to oncogene-specific kinase inhibitors may be warranted.']",

They develop aggressive NSCLC that metastasize to multiple sites and display a stepwise, directly age-related progression, mimicking several features observed in lung cancer patients. Lung cancer progression in p53R172Hg/K-rasG12D mice was characterized by non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. p53R172Hg/K-rasG12D mice develop lung adenocarcinomas already evident in 10 week-old mice, with a variable degree of differentiation. A significant gender difference in tumor progression was observed, with females developing more tumors than males. Moreover, by using qRT-PCR, some of the antigens deregulated in human lung cancer turned out to be up-regulated also during cancer progression in our mouse model, suggesting that p53R172Hg/K-rasG12D mice recapitulate the metastatic nature of human NSCLC.

We aim to show the prevalence of targetable GA in our stage 4 adenocarcinoma (AC) pts will be greater in our population compared to the LCMC, with an increase from 35% to 50%; and an improvement in use of targeted therapy from 22% to 40%. Study subjects without a known genotype undergo genomic profiling with the FoundationOne test. Results', ' Preliminary results of 63 pts with stage 4 AC show that 83% have either an ALK re-arrangement n = 29 (46%), an EGFR activating mutation n = 16 (25%), a ROS1 fusion n = 4 (6%), a RET fusion n = 2 (3%) or a HER2 mutation n = 2 (3%).

Methods', '    Over 6,700 non-small cell lung cancer cases referred to Caris Life Sciences between 2009 and 2014. Diagnoses and history were collected from referring physicians.  Specific testing was performed per physician request and included a combination of sequencing (Sanger, NGS or pyrosequencing), protein expression (IHC), gene amplification/rearrangement (CISH or FISH), and/or RNA fragment analysis.  Results', '    Tumors profiles from patients with hormone receptor positive disease (HER2, ER, PR, or AR positive by IHC) (n=629), HER2 mutations (n=8) ALK rearrangements (n=55), ROS1 rearrangement (n=17), cMET amplification or mutation (n=126), and cKIT mutation (n=11) were included in this analysis and compared to the whole cohort. Tumors with ALK rearrangement overexpressed AR in 18% of cases, and 7% presented with concomitant KRAS mutation. Lower rates of PTEN loss, as assessed by IHC, were observed in ALK positive (20%), ROS1 positive (9%) and cKIT mutated tumors (25%) compared to the overall NSCLC population (58%). cMET was overexpressed in 66% of ROS1 translocated and 57% of HER2 mutated tumors. cKIT mutations were found co-existing with APC (20%) and EGFR (20%) mutations. Pathway analysis revealed that hormone receptor positive disease carried more mutations in the ERK pathway (32%) compared to 9% in the mTOR pathway. 25% of patients with HER2 mutations harbored a co-existing mutation in the mTOR pathway.  Conclusions', '    Pathway profiling reveals that NSCLC tumors present more often than reported with several concomitant alterations affecting the ERK or AKT pathway. Additionally, they are also characterized by the expression of potential biological modifiers of the cell cycle like hormonal receptors, representing a rationale for dual inhibition strategies in selected patients.

Crizotinib, ALK/ROS1/cMET tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), showed high effect against ROS1-rearranged NSCLC in the clinical trials and is approved in US and EU. However, the cancers inevitably relapse due to the acquired resistance such as ROS1-G2032R mutation. We previously reported that cabozantinib could overcome those secondary mutations mediated crizotinib-resistance. Based on this finding, we tried to establish cabozantinib-resistant ROS1 mutant cells by ENU mutagenesis screening. Surprisingly, we found out a few CD74-ROS1 mutant clones that only grew in the presence of low-dose cabozantinib. Namely, these mutant clones were “addicted” to cabozantinib. When the fluorescent labeled cabozantinib addicted ROS1 mutant cells were co-cultured with non-addicted CD74-ROS1-WT-BaF3 cell in the presence or absence of low-dose cabozantinib, the drug-addicted cells became dominant in the low-dose cabozantinib, and CD74-ROS1-WT cells became dominant in the absence of it. To analyze the molecular mechanism of “drug-addiction” in the addicted CD74-ROS1 mutant cells, we performed comprehensive analysis such as inhibitor screening, cDNA microarray, and phosphoproteome analysis. As the result, we observed that the expression and phosphorylation of CD74-ROS1 in the addicted cells were excessively upregulated within 24 hours after removal of cabozantinib or other ROS1 inhibitors, such as crizotinib or lorlatinib. We also observed that the apoptosis was induced in these cells upon ROS1 inhibitor removal, whereas ROS1 mediated growth signaling were simultaneously activated. Consistent with this, cDNA microarray analysis revealed that the expression of both cell survival and cell death related genes were changed by ROS1 inhibitor removal. Furthermore, we identified that several proteins were highly phosphorylated by excessive ROS1 activation originated from ROS1 inhibitor removal. These observations suggest that these drug-addicted cells were died by excessive oncogenic signaling, and the appropriate oncogene signaling by low-dose TKI made them survive and grow without inducing apoptosis. Thus, the excessive oncogene signaling has “double-edged sword” characteristics for cancer cell viability and those characteristics could be a new therapeutic target.']",

        "Background":"['Chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are usually mediated by induction of apoptosis; this usually results in drug resistant during the therapy. Many compounds from natural resource have been shown to trigger autophagy in promoting cell death, and therefore which could be a novel treatment for cancer. Ginkgetin, a biflavonoid from Ginkgo biloba leaves (Ginkgoaceae), was shown its anticancer effects recently. The leaf of G. biloba is being recorded as a safe herbal drug in Pharmacopoeia from China and Europe. Here, the possible development of ginkgetin as an anticancer drug was demonstrated. Ginkgetin induced the death in A549 (NSCLC) with an IC50 lower than that of cisplatin. This anticancer effect of ginkgetin was also illustrated in NSCLC xenograft nude mice model. Transmission electronic microscope revealed that ginkgetin-induced autophagy was the main cause of cell death. Autophagy inhibitors, 3-methyladenine and chloroquine but not apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, rescued ginkgetin-induced cell death. Reciprocally, the induction of autophagy by rapamycin promoted ginkgetin-induced cell death, as well as the formation of p62-TRAF6-mTOR. During autophagy, p62 is hypothesized to be a target of ginkgetin-induced autophagic cell death. This notion is supported by several lines of evidence. The application of ginkgetin blocked fully the expression of p62 in cultured A549, and in contrast the over expression of p62 reduced ginkgetin-induced autophagy and cell death concomitantly with the decline on autophagosome formation. In parallel, the modulation on p62 expression could regulate Nrf2 activity and ROS level in the presence of ginkgetin. Thus, autophagy could act as an inducer in ginkgetin-induced cell death, and p62 was proposed to be a possible target during this process. Here, ginkgetin exhibited promising anticancer effect in NSCLC via autophagy, a signaling very different to orthodox chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin. Besides, ginkgetin is a phytochemical from G. biloba that is considered as a safe herbal supplement, and no obvious toxicity was observed in xenograft nude mice. Therefore, ginkgetin is proposed to be a potential compound for the development of novel anticancer drug.

This study was undertaken to develop an ultra-deep plasma NGS panel for patients with non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).Methods / Results', ' Plasma was prospectively collected from 51 patients with advanced, progressive NSCLC and a known oncogenic driver from prior tumor genotyping. We performed ultra-deep NGS on extracted cfDNA using a customized Illumina library preparation, hybrid capture panel covering 37 lung cancer related genes (complete exons and partial introns), and ultra-deep sequencing (HiSeq4000). Mean sequencing depth was 50,000X (150 million, 150bp reads per sample). After specialized consensus-based error correction for low allele frequency (AF) genomic alterations, the median unique DNA molecules per position were 3,500. The mean sequence error rate was reduced by 20-fold to 0.002%, enabling the confident call of a driver mutation as low as 0.03%. In a subset of cases, paired plasma droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was performed for common EGFR and KRAS mutations using a validated assay.Blinded to tumor genotype, plasma NGS detected SNVs (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF), indels (EGFR, ERBB2), and fusions (ALK, ROS1) as well as significant copy number gains (CNG) (ERBB2, MET). Sensitivity of cfDNA for the detection of known oncogenic drivers was 88% (45/51). A single false positive driver mutation was identified in a case with a known EGFR mutation in tumor; plasma NGS found both EGFR exon 19 del (0.88% AF) and KRAS G12D (2.65% AF), and plasma ddPCR confirmed the presence of both mutations (2.2% and 2.0% AF).

        "Background":"[\"BackgroundGenome wide association studies (GWAS) of lung cancer have identified susceptibility loci at 15q25, 5p15, 6p21, 13q13 and 22q12 that contain relevant candidate genes such as CHRNA3/5, TERT, HLA, BRCA2 and CHEK2, respectively. Many of these alleles appear more relevant to a particularly histological type of lung cancer.With the aim of identifying novel lung cancer susceptibility loci, The Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung (TRICL), the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO) and Lung Cancer Cohort Consortium (LC3) have undertaken a very large collaborative GWAS across 29 lung cancer studies, including analysis of the predominant lung cancer histological subtypes.MethodsIn collaboration with the Center for Disease Research (CIDR), TRICL, ILCCO and LC3 have genotyped 18,000 case-control pairs on the GAME-On Oncoarray. SNP imputation was undertaken using the 1,000 Genomes v3 reference panel, followed by logistic regression of each genetic variant with lung cancer and considering ancestry inferred by genetic profile to correct for cryptic population structure. The OncoArray and our previous GWAS results were combined using meta-analysis. This allowed for a GWAS of 10,155,682 SNPs for 25,655 lung cancer cases and 52,451 controls, as well as histology specific analysis of 6,629 squamous cell and 9,817 adenocarcinomas. Alternate genotyping techniques (Affymetrix, Taqman) were used to confirm the fidelity of the genotyping for variants of interest.ResultsWe have identified common genetic variants exceeding genome wide significance (p<510-8) at eleven novel susceptibility loci. This included two associated with overall lung cancer (1p31, 19q13), eight with lung adenocarcinomas (3q28, 6p25, 8p12, 9p21, 10q25, 11q23, 15q21, 20q13) and one with squamous-cell lung carcinomas (10q24). These genetic variants are located near several intriguing candidate genes, such as telomere function genes (OBFC1, RTEL1), nicotine metabolism genes (CYP2A6), genes somatically mutated in lung cancer (NRG1) and genetic susceptibility loci linked to other cancers (IRF4, CDNK2A). In additional, we noted several borderline (p<10-6) associations with common variants located near nicotine addiction genes (CHRNB2, CHRNA2, CHRNA4, DBH) and other genes somatically translocated in lung cancer (ROS1). Integration of eQTL databases suggests that many of the associated genetic variants influence gene expression levels of these candidate genes.ConclusionWe have identified eleven novel lung cancer susceptibility loci, doubling the number implicated by GWAS. These genetic variants were common (MAF 0.05-0.49) with modest to small genetic effects (OR's 1.10-1.17). Further expansion of GWAS efforts, particularly within histological subtypes of lung cancer, is likely to identify additional susceptibility loci and further increase our understanding of lung cancer aetiology.\"]",

Methods', ' To identify targetable co-dependencies or cooperating pathways for RET fusion-positive lung cancers, we performed high-throughput chemical and genetic screens to find FDA-approved drugs or genes that when inhibited, would synergize with cabozantinib in RET fusion-positive lung cancer cell lines. In addition we performed NGS of a pair of pre-treatment and post-cabozantinib progression samples. Results', ' We identified EGFR siRNAs and anti-EGFR drugs as synergistic with cabozantinib. Combinations of drugs that target EGFR (cetuximab, afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) and RET (cabozantinib, CEP-32496, lenvatinib, vandetanib) were more effective at reducing growth of RET cell lines than any single agent in vitro and in xenograft models. Cabozantinib treatment of RET fusion-positive cell lines inhibited EGFR and RET phosphorylation, an observation not seen in RET wild-type cell lines. Co-immunoprecipitation studies reveal that RET and EGFR interact. Ectopic expression of CCDC6-RET in NIH-3T3 or human bronchial epithelial cells resulted in upregulation of multiple ERBB receptors and ligands (not seen in a ROS1 fusion-positive cell line) and a concomitant increase in EGFR stability. Treatment with ERBB pathway ligands or overexpression of EGFR decreased sensitivity to cabozantinib in two RET fusion-positive cell lines. Finally, sequencing of a pair of pre-treatment and post-progression samples from a lung cancer patient treated with cabozantinib revealed acquired amplification of EGFR in the latter sample. Conclusions', ' Taken together, these results suggest that the tumorigenic potential of RET fusion oncogenes is dependent on deregulation of ERBB-activated pathways and that a combination of RET and EGFR drugs could be more effective in treating RET fusion-positive tumors.

There are several examples where targeted inhibition of the resulting fusion produces dramatic clinical response. For example, the EML4-ALK fusion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Other ALK fusions have been described in NSCLC and other diseases including the NPM-ALK fusion in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). The efficacy of crizotinib and other ALK inhibitors are being investigated in these diseases. ALK is also subject to activation via mutation and sensitivity to crizotinib is reported in ALK mutation positive neuroblastoma. Finally, crizotinib has activity not only against ALK, but also against ROS1, MST1R and MET. ROS1 fusions have been found in NSCLC and glioblastoma, and MET amplification events in gastric adenocarcinoma identify additional settings that may benefit from crizotinib treatment.   Methods', '  To further understand the full therapeutic potential of Crizotinib, we undertook a genomic survey of ALK, ROS1, MET and MST1R across 1,000s of patients from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine.  Results', '  We confirmed the presence of EML4-ALK fusions in both lung and colorectal cancer (CRC), and also identified a novel ALK fusion in CRC. ALK hotspot mutations and focal amplifications were confined to neuroblastoma, as previously described. Our survey of ROS1 identified rare novel fusions in NSCLC and glioblastoma, and high-level amplifications in liposarcoma (2%) and rarely in breast cancer (0.2%). No fusions were identified for MET, however high-level amplifications were observed in 1-5% of papillary renal cell carcinoma, the intestinal subtype of gastric adenocarcinoma, oliogodendroglioma, glioblastoma and lung adenocarcinoma. Hotspot mutations were frequently observed in squamous head and neck (11%), and more rarely in hepatocellular carcinoma, small cell lung and ovarian cancers.   Conclusions', '   These results leverage all available genomic profiling data to provide a broadened scope of therapeutic opportunity for inhibitors like crizotinib.

        "Background":"['Under normal conditions MET receptor activation, internalization, and degradation is a highly controlled process regulated by the binding of its ligand, HGF. In many cancers however, MET becomes highly dysregulated, and MET overexpression, with or without gene amplification, is associated with a poorer prognosis. Aberrant activation of MET can also occur through mutation, or increased autocrine or paracrine HGF production. MET activation leads to increased oncogenic activities including cell migration, proliferation, invasion, survival, tumor neovascularization and decreased apoptosis. Several inhibitors of MET, including type I and type II kinase inhibitors, are currently being investigated in clinical trials. LY2801653 is a type II MET kinase inhibitor being investigated in patients with advanced cancer (trial I3O-MC-JSBA, NCT01285037). In addition to MET, LY2801653 also inhibits ROS1 kinase, and the serine/threonine kinases MKNK1/2, with cell-based IC50 of 23nM and 7nM respectively. ROS1 is an orphan receptor that can be constitutively activated as a fusion protein either by genomic microdeletion or translocation. ROS1 fusion proteins are found in glioblastoma, NSCLC and cholangiocarcinoma. MKNK1/2 are kinases downstream of ERK and p38 and are capable of regulating translation through the direct phosphorylation of eIF4E. Increased MKNK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of the translation factor eIF4E is observed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and is correlated with a poor prognosis. This study evaluated the relative inhibitory effects of LY2801653, Crizotinib, XL184, XL880, and PF4217903 in a variety of cell lines against MET, ROS1, MKNK1/2, ERK, and other downstream molecules. In HCC78, a ROS1-fusion protein bearing cell line, and in NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with the FIG-ROS(s) fusion, LY2801653, XL184 and XL880 were more potent inhibitors of ROS1 compared with Crizotinib. Moreover, LY2801653 and Crizotinib were both efficacious in NIH3T3 FIG-ROS(s) xenografts, although LY2801653 was more potent in reducing p-ROS1 in these tumors than Crizotinib. In NCI-H2122 and Hs746T cells (mutated MET), A2780 cells (MET-negative), KP-4 cells (MET autocrine), H441 cells (HGF-independent; MET positive), HCT116 (mutated KRAS), and the cholangiocarcinoma cell lines EGI-1 and TFK-1, LY2801653 demonstrated more potent inhibitory activity against MKNK1/2 versus treatment with XL184 and XL880, while Crizotinib had no observed inhibitory activity against MKNK1/2. LY2801653 also showed inhibitory activity against MKNK1/2 in MET-amplified MKN45 cells. These findings suggests there may be clinical merits to testing LY2801653 in tumor types associated with increased MKNK1/2 activity or ROS1 fusion proteins alone, or in conjunction with aberrant MET activity, such as colorectal carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma.']",

Targeted therapy precisely treats mutated cancer pathways and has significantly higher response rates compared to chemotherapy. However, tumor heterogeneity is prevalent in NSCLC patients, and the common practice of detecting mutations using tissue biopsy from a fraction of a single tumor can be less than satisfactory. Failure to detect molecular resistance emerging from heterogenic tumor cell population is a major reason that, even though highly effective, targeted therapy has not contributed greatly to prolong patient survival. We aim to develop a cost-effective, highly sensitive and specific liquid biopsy for advanced stage NSCLC patients that is able to capture a comprehensive tumor profile and monitor tumor response to therapy. Innovation', ' BEST (Blocker-based Enrichment System for Tumor DNA) blocks primer extension of over 90% of wild type DNA and allows preferential amplification of the mutant allele.

BEST is comprised of a multiplex of circulating tumor DNA enrichment reaction and a multiplex plasma cDNA enrichment reaction. Our BEST NSCLC liquid biopsy panel enriches >100 fold for the above driver mutations. The ability to detect a myriad of mutations in heterogenic tumor cell populations allows dynamic and personalized treatment during the course of the disease.

Current IHC based diagnostics are challenged by assay and slide scoring issues, and more robust and comprehensive biomarkers of ICPI efficacy are needed. Methods', ' Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was performed on FFPE specimens during the course of clinical care. TMB (mutations/Mb) was assessed as the number of somatic, coding, base substitution and indel alterations per Mb of genome. The top quartile of LC was classified as TMB high. Microsatellite instable (MSI-H) or stable (MSS) status was determined using a proprietary computational algorithm. Results', ' TMB was similar across all LC histologies, but elevated compared to an average TMB of 7.3 for all 60,000+ samples in the database. TMB was consistently low in LC harboring known drivers, with the exception of BRAF or KRAS mutant tumors. (See Table.) 22/5,895 LC cases (0.4%) assessed were MSI-H and 5,849 (99%) were MSS. 21/22 MSI-H cases had high TMB, and represented 9 Adeno, 7 NSCLC NOS, 5 SCC, and 1 SCLC. Alterations in BRCA1, BRCA2, and POLE were significantly enriched in LC with high TMB. 85 (0.7%) of 11,662 LC had PD-L1amplification.

        "Background":"['Oncogenic mechanisms in SCLC remain poorly understood leaving this tumor with the worst prognosis among all lung cancers. Unlike other cancer types, traditional genomic approaches have been of limited success in SCLC. For instance, no patterns of prevalent mutations associated with SCLC progression or targeted therapeutics have emerged. Gene expression profiling based on differential expression have yielded potentially useful signatures in SCLC, but they have proven to be independent of each other and with minimal overlap, reducing translational potential. Nonetheless, since integrative systems biology studies of SCLC are warranted, we hypothesized that gene co-expression analyses can unveil key signaling hubs of specific networks that regulate SCLC proliferation and survival. We applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to a lung cancer patient gene expression dataset comprising of normal lung (NL), SCLC and Non-SCLC (NSCLC) such as squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, and identified hierarchical gene networks highly specific to SCLC. The hubs of these SCLC-specific networks formed a SCLC-specific hub network (SSHN) signature that', ' 1) classified SCLC from NSCLC and NL on 3 independent patient and 1 cell line datasets; 2) was validated in independent RNAseq and shotgun proteomic patient datasets; 3) identified 2 SCLC subtypes with high and low SSHN expression in patients and cell lines. Three top SSHN hubs, Fyn, Syk and BRCA1, are involved in oxidative stress (OSR) and DNA damage response (DDR), respectively. At the protein level, Fyn, Syk and BRCA1 were significantly co-expressed in tissue microarrays and classified SCLC patients into 2 subtypes', ' High and Low Fyn/Syk/BRCA1 (F/S/B). High F/S/B staining significantly correlated with longer recurrence-free survival of patients treated with standard chemotherapy, suggesting that efficient OSR and DDR may enhance chemo response. This possibility was tested in established SCLC cell lines, which also could be separated into high vs low F/S/B groups corresponding to the clinical subtypes. High F/S/B cell lines exhibited lower proliferative rates, suggesting that OSR and DDR may still exert influence over cell cycle. Syk knockdown in these cell lines caused significant reduction in cellular viability and proliferation, as well as increased levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Induction of oxidative stress in High F/S/B cell lines resulted in early activation of Fyn, Syk, p38, Erk and Akt. Thus, OSR may be overactive in SCLC and play a role in its natural history and response to treatment. In summary, our WGCNA combinatorial approach yielded novel insights into SCLC pathogenesis, separated two novel SCLC molecular subtypes with distinct functional OSR and DDR properties, and pointed to unsuspected potential therapeutic targets.']",

        "Background":"['Genotype-directed targeted therapies are transforming the care of advanced cancer. However, having adequate tumor tissue for comprehensive genotyping remains a challenge for many patients. We recently reported on a new assay for noninvasive plasma genotyping using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) of cell free DNA (cfDNA) (Oxnard et al., CCR, 2014). While appealing in its simplicity, ddPCR assays cannot detect complex genomic alterations such as chromosomal rearrangements and cannot be massively multiplexed; a key requirement for efficiently testing for the increasing number of rare but targetable genomic alterations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Here we report on a novel, targeted, bias-corrected, and quantitative Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) solution for analyses of cfDNA. Our plasma NGS assay is focused on targetable driver mutations and rearrangements in lung cancer targeting 23 exons, 9 introns covering 17kb for 10 driver genes. Rather than using traditional hybrid capture, our assay integrates efficient fragment cloning, guided target retrieval, and molecular annotation of library sequences, which reduces off-target reads and improves signal-to-noise ratio. Performance of this assay panel was optimized in two iterations of probe design using targeted sequencing results of fifteen annotated NSCLC-derived cell lines. We were able to detect hotspot base changes and indels with 100% sensitivity and specificity at mutant allele frequencies of 1% and with 92.3% specificity at allele frequencies less than 0.1%. An automated pipeline for mutation calling correctly identified rare alleles with a sensitivity and specificity for point mutations and indels of >90% at allele frequencies of 0.2%. We then piloted the technology using cfDNA from a patient with newly diagnosed advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC and two NSCLC patients with micro-duplication/insertions in Her2neu. Blinded to the true tumor sequences, our NGS platform detected the correct ALK rearrangement (EML4-ALK v2) in 2 separate reads as well as the correct Her2neu insertions (2311-2322dup and 2332-2340 dup) in circulating DNA. We further show clinical translation to plasma from a cohort of 20 lung cancer patients that harbored rare driver genetic events, including ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements by tissue sequencing.We are the first to sequence chromosomal rearrangements in plasma without prior knowledge of tissue genotyping results. The potential for this NGS-based plasma genotyping assay to allow for the noninvasive, multiplexed detection of complex, targetable genomic alterations including rearrangements and rare mutations represents a significant improvement over existing methods.']",

        "Background":"['ALK, ROS1, and TRK inhibitors have achieved marked efficacy in treating cancer patients expressing abnormal ALK, ROS1 or NTRK genes. However, the initial success of these therapies is rapidly overshadowed with the development of acquired resistance. In addition, approximately 30-40% of ALK + or ROS1+ NSCLC patients fail to respond to initial crizotinib treatment, representing intrinsic resistance. Target gene amplification, acquired resistance mutations, bypass signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis are the common resistance mechanisms. None of the current ALK, ROS1 or TRK inhibitors can overcome bypass or EMT-based resistance when applied as a single agent therapy. TPX-0005 is a potent kinase inhibitor against WT and mutated ALK, ROS1 and TRK family kinases, especially the clinically significant solvent front mutations. At clinically relevant concentrations, TPX-0005 also inhibits JAK2, SRC and FAK that are important targets in modulating multiple resistance mechanisms. H2228 lung cancer cell line endogenously expresses EML4-ALK v3 and was reported to be resistant to ALK inhibitor TAE684. Upregulation of the bypass signaling kinase EGFR, EMT marker vimentin, and cancer stem-like marker CD44 was reported in H2228 cells, likely leading to intrinsic resistance to ALK inhibitors. In the anti-proliferation assay, both crizotinib and ceritinib were resistant in H2228 cells with IC50 values around 1000 nM, however, TPX-0005 was able to overcome the intrinsic resistance with an IC50 of 100 nM. In H2228 cells, TPX-0005 suppressed the phosphorylation of SRC, FAK and paxillin with IC50 values in a range of 80-100 nM, and downregulated the expression of EGFR, CD44, and vimentin with IC50 values around 100 nM. In addition, TPX-0005 inhibited the phosphorylation of the oncogenic transcription/translation factor YB-1 with an IC50 value around 100 nM in H2228 cells. YB-1 is involved in many aspects of gene expression control that lead to tumor cell growth and drug resistance, including modulation of EGFR upregulation, EMT, and cancer stemness. Therefore, it was postulated that inhibition of SRC/FAK by TPX-0005 suppressed the phosphorylation of YB-1, leading to the downregulation of EGFR, CD44 and vimentin, and eventually to anti-proliferation effect on H2228 cells. TPX-0005 demonstrated an in vitro anti-metastatic activity by inhibiting cell migration in both H2228 cells and HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. Taken together, the potent kinase inhibitory activities against SRC/FAK signaling provide a unique polypharmacology profile to TPX-0005 for combatting multiple resistance mechanisms simultaneously, including a broad spectrum of acquired mutations, bypass signaling, EMT, cancer stemness, and metastasis.']",

Using immunohistochemical staining (IHC), we stained all tumors with antibodies for 10 RTKs; c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET and ROS1. We scored the expression of these RTKs for all enrolled tumors, and compared them according to the histological types.Results', 'The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups.

Recently, we found that increased shh producing cells correlate with enhanced migration, invasiveness and increased lymphangiogenesis in Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the mechanism is unknown. In this study, we investigated the function of shh pathway in human NSCLC. We performed immunohistochemistry on lung tumor biopsies and the result showed the expressions of shh, Gli1, VEGF-D and LYVE1 were enhanced in lymph node metastasis specimens compared to lymph node negative lung cancer specimens. We also investigated the role of shh signaling in the invasiveness and the motility of NSCLC. We found that Shh N-terminal peptide (N-shh) enhanced cell motility and invasiveness in NSCLC, and this process was inhibited by AAD-cyclopamine (SMO inhibitor). We observed that the mRNA expressions of shh, Gli1, VEGF-D and LYVE1 were enhanced by N-shh treatment, whereas no increase of these factors was observed when KAAD-Cyclopamine (a Shh signaling inhibitor) was treated together. In addition, we confirmed that Shh-induced lymphangiogenesis and motility/invasiveness of NSCLC are also reduced by LY294002, PI-3 Kinase/Akt inhibitor meaning that shh pathway and PI-3 Kinase/Akt are strongly related. Thus, we investigated the functional relationship between Shh and Akt signaling in the metastatic progression in NSCLC. Phosphorylation of Akt was enhanced by N-Shh, but regulated by KAAD-cyclopamine or LY294002. We further analyzed the effects of shh signaling in vitro by stimulating a HMVEC with N-shh and we observed N-shh enhanced the tube formation on matrigel, but the enhancement was inhibited upon cyclopamine or LY294002 treatment. The ROS production was increased in shh-overexpressing cells. These results indicate that shh signaling pathway can contribute to ROS generation enhancing the metastatic and lymphangiogenetic potential of tumor cells.

        "Background":"['Cisplatin resistance remains a clinical challenge for the treatment of lung cancer. We have previously shown that all cisplatin resistant (CR) cells tested have high ROS and low thioredoxin-1 (TRX1) protein. These biochemical changes lead to metabolic re-programming and hence these CR cells depend on fatty acid (FA) metabolism. To further confirm these finding, here we show a correlation between the levels of cisplatin resistance and ROS production, intracellular TRX1 levels and metabolic changes in tumor cells. We have established multiple CR clones with different levels of CR from small cell and non small cell lung cancer H69 and H460 (purchased from ATCC) and from cell lines derived from our lung cancer patients (SCLC1 and NSCLCS). These clones have different levels of cisplatin resistance ranging from 2, 5, to 10 fold. The stepwise increases in cisplatin resistance are correlated with a progressive increase in ROS production while intracellular TRX1 levels are gradually decreasing. Furthermore, CR cells which are highly resistant to cisplatin (2-3fold or more) with high ROS levels are hypersensitive to ROS inducing agent, elesclomol. Importantly, when ROS production increased by 5% or more, lung cancer cells become more sensitive to an agent that interferes with the FA synthesis pathway such as TOFA (an acetyl-coA carboxylase inhibitor) but resistant to glycolytic inhibitors. Thus, our data suggest that CR cells were no longer dependant on glycolysis, but instead are reliant on oxidative metabolism (OXMET). Since CR cells are sensitive to elesclomol, we have investigated whether combination of TOFA and elesclomol can increase cell death in CR cells. Our data showed that elesclomol alone at 5nM results in 35-40% cell death in 72hr. Interestingly, combination treatment with a non-toxic dose of TOFA (0.1g/ml) resulted in significant increase in cell death to 70%; (p<0.05). At a higher dose of elesclomol (10nM) which yield 50% cell death, combination with TOFA (0.1ug/ml) results in 95% cell death (p<0.05). Our findings strongly suggest that the levels of cisplatin resistance correlate with the levels of ROS production but inversely correlate with intracellular TRX1. When ROS production increases, these CR cells also become less addicted to glucose, but use FA as their energy source. Thus, by targeting ROS (elesclomol) and OXMET (TOFA), one can successfully kill CR cells without significant effect to normal cells (LL24, a lung fibroblast as control). Overall, these findings could have future implications for drug development to selectively target and eliminate CR tumors with a high ROS and low TRX1profile.

In addition, circulating cell-free DNA in the blood is undergoing assessment as an accessible biomarker for dynamic monitoring of treatment efficacy and clonal evolution of the cancer patient's entire tumor burden. Thus a new paradigm for monitoring and resistance of solid tumors is currently under development\", ' sequencing the initial tumor biopsy for driver mutations followed by ultrasensitive detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using methods such as digital PCR (dPCR).In recent years, dPCR has become the gold standard for precise quantification of nucleic acids, showing detection sensitivities unparalleled by other methodologies. Picodroplet-formatted dPCR compartmentalizes the sample (and one or more assay) into a large enough number of discrete reaction volumes (e.g. 10 million) such that there is at most one target molecule per reaction. Standard qPCR reagents (target-specific primers and fluorescent hydrolysis probes) and master mixes are used for endpoint PCR amplification, resulting in plateaued fluorescent signals only in target-containing compartments. This enables digital counting of the absolute number of target molecules present in the sample volume tested.Here we report the use of the RainDrop dPCR system together with multiplexed assays measuring the most common cancer-relevant mutations in EGFR. Multiplexed primer and probe sets were designed for wild-type EGFR, T790M and L858R point mutations, and exon 19 deletions in EGFR. Using spike-in plasmid controls and genomic DNA from lung cancer cell lines (H1975,H1650), we verified simultaneous detection and discrimination of all mutations across a broad dynamic range. Finally, we demonstrated application of the multiplexed EGFR assays on matched tumor and ctDNA samples from lung cancer patients.Sensitive quantification of EGFR mutations in lung cancer patients is critical for stratifying patients into different treatment regimens, and can potentially benefit EGFR mutation-positive patients by allowing dynamic non-invasive tracking of treatment efficacy and clonal evolution. Development of a multiplexed dPCR EGFR mutation assay should facilitate personalizing lung cancer therapy and treatment management, towards the goal of monitoring disease progression for better outcomes. The RainDrop system enables sensitive simultaneous dPCR detection of multiple mutations from the same sample, which is particularly important when available sample is limited, e.g. with tumor biopsies, FFPE samples, circulating tumor cells, and ctDNA in biological fluids.']",

Here, we report rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR) amplification as a novel genetic abnormality in a young patient with non-small cell lung cancer. This male patient was a never smoker and was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinorma at the age of 18. He initially presented with refractory cough and persistent left lung lesions. Pathology was consistent with lung adenocarcinorma, poorly differentiated. Extensive molecular testing was negative for common genetic alterations in K-RAS, EGFR, ALK, HER2, RET, AKT, PIK3CA, BRAF and ROS1. His tumor was subsequently subjected to next generation DNA sequencing (FoundationOne, Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA) targeting a cohort of more than 180 cancer-related genes. This analysis identified rictor amplification of at least 6 copies as the sole DNA abnormality. Immunohistochemistry further documented rictor overexpression in the patient's lung tumor. The neoplastic lung tissue exhibited diffuse and strong cytoplasmic staining for rictor, compared to surrounding non-neoplastic tissues. Furthermore, the tumor tissue showed diffuse overexpression of phospho-S473 Akt, an essential downstream target of rictor.Rictor is a key component of mTORC2 complex, where it modifies actin cytoskeleton organization, cell proliferation and survival. Activation of rictor signaling has been suggested to play critical roles in regulating cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis in breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers and gliomas. To our knowledge, this is the first report of rictor amplification in lung cancer. Moreover, we found that blockade of the rictor-mTORC2 pathway by siRNA-mediated rictor knockdown or with pharmacological inhibitors led to decreased phosphorylation of S473-AKT and growth inhibition in lung cancer cell lines. Thus, rictor amplification may represent a potential novel target in lung cancer. We will perform further studies to determine whether rictor amplification is a unique molecular subtype of lung cancer.

The emergence of secondary mutations within the ALK kinase domain or the activation of compensatory signaling pathways in crizotinib and other ALKi refractory tumors prompted searches for next generation of ALKi active against resistance mutations as single agents or in combination with other treatments.

The recent association of ALK, ROS and RET fusion transcripts as lung tumor therapy predictive biomarkers has increased the need of a technology that could detect these biomarkers starting from limited amount of material. Life Technologies and OncoNetwork consortium collaborated for the development of a lung fusion panel based on Ion AmpliSeq RNA chemistry. The OncoNetwork consortium is comprised of twelve -translational cancer research institutes with many years of experience in adopting the latest molecular techniques for lung therapy research. Material and Methods', \" Consortia's requirements for the panel development \", \" 1) detect all variants of ALK, ROS1, or RET fusion transcripts described in COSMIC in a single reaction using 10 ng of total RNA 2) Include 5 and 3 ALK, ROS1, RET gene expression assays as an indicator of a translocation at this gene. 3) Include endogenous RNA assay controls to determine if the quality of the results could be affected by RNA quality. 4) Provide similar results on archived FFPE samples tested by FISH. Human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines H2228 (EML4-ALK positive), HCC78 (SLC4A2-ROS1 positive ) ,LC-2/ad (CCDC6-RET positive) and Ambion FirstChoice Human Brain Reference (HBR) RNA was used as positive and negative control for the study. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue was isolated using different extraction methods. After amplification using Ion AmpliSeq RNA chemistry samples were sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM sequencer using the Ion PGM 200 Sequencing Kit. The presence of the fusions was confirmed by custom TaqMan gene expression assays when possible. Preliminary results of the panel on ALK or ROS1 or RET positive cell lines and FFPE archived cancer research samples gave good concordance with FISH results. Expected negative samples were confirmed negative. We found a KIF5B-RET fusion positive sample in a sample not previously tested for RET fusions. Two of the expected positive samples by FISH were found negative due to limited amount to tumor cells present in the sample. Cell line RNA dilutions were performed to determine the panel's limit of detection. We demonstrate a limit of detection of 1 % tumor RNA in the presence of 99 % normal RNA using the panel with 10 ng of RNA extracted by cell lines. Gene expression controls work well as an indicator of the RNA quality and of the translocation presence. The Ion AmpliSeq RNA lung cancer fusion panel workflow is easier and faster to perform in comparison to the FISH method. The results obtained to date are highly encouraging for panel to be used in the clinical research setting. More data needs to be analyzed before a final conclusion is made.\"]",

Although a platinum-doublet regimen has become the standard of care, the benefit is modest and the 5-year survival rate has remained essentially unchanged over the past 3 decades. Recently, several molecular alterations have been defined as driver mutations, such as mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), KRas, chimeric tyrosine kinases involving ALK, RET, ROS1. And molecular targeting therapies for lung adenocarcinoma, targeting mutant EGFR or ALK, RET and ROS1 fusions, limit non-tumor toxicity and extend survival time compared to the conventional chemotherapies. However, there is no effective molecularly targeted therapy for mutant KRas-driven lung adenocarcinoma, the most frequent type of lung adenocarcinoma in the Caucasian population. Therefore, specific therapies that target various lung tumor types are desperately needed.Midkine (MDK) is a heparin-binding growth factor that is highly expressed in many malignant tumors, including lung cancers. We have previously reported that a MDK inhibitor', ' iMDK suppresses non-small cell lung cancer expressing MDK in vitro and in vivo without harming normal cells. Importantly, iMDK inhibits the PI3 kinase / Akt pathway and induces apoptosis in MDK expressing non-small cell lung cancer cells. In the present study, we have investigated the combination effect of iMDK and a mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD0325901. The combination treatment of iMDK and PD0325901 more effectively suppressed cell viability and colony formation, increased caspase-3 activity and induced apoptosis than those of single use in H441 and H2009 pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells harboring a G12 KRas mutation.

Our genome-wide sequencing study revealed that oncogene aberration positive LADCs carry less numbers of mutations in cancer-related genes than negative ones (Saito, Cancer Res, 2015), indicating a small mutation burden in the development of the formers. Consistently, a clinical trial of anti-PD-1 therapy indicated that EGFR-mutation positive cases do not benefit well from the therapy (Borghaei et al., N Engl J Med. 2015). LADC driven by somatic EGFR mutations is more prevalent in East Asians (30-50%) than in European/Americans (10-20%). We recently revealed that variations in HLA-class II loci underlie the risk of the disease, by conducting a genome-wide association study of 3,173 patients and 15,158 controls, combined with imputation of HLA alleles using a Japanese-specific panel (Shiraishi et al., Nature Comm, 2016). The result indicates that LADC develops in vivo through interaction between somatic mutations and germline variations that modulate immune reaction. Therefore, efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade targeting therapy might also be influenced by such germline variations. On the other hand, oncogene-negative LADCs show a high mutation burden associated with nonsynonymous mutations in chromatin remodeling and other cancer-related genes. Thus, these cases would respond well to immune checkpoint blockade targeting therapies.

Previous studies carried out in our lab showed intensified mitochondrial respiration and increased levels of heme and hemoproteins in NSCLCs. We examined the effect of heme depletion on mitochondrial biogenesis and function. We observed that mitochondrial functions such as ATP production, NAD/NADH ratios and ROS production are also affected by heme depletion.

Cigarette smoke (CS) is the cause of 90% of lung cancer cases, and promotes drug resistance in lung cancer patients and is even known to limit effectiveness of treatment of cancers of other organs. It is therefore important to develop more effective strategies targeting CS-induced molecular abnormalities. Cigarette smoking increases oxidative stress particularly via activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX), a key source of superoxide anion production. Here we report the inhibitory effects of bioactive phytochemicals, grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs), on the migration potential of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (A549, H460 and H1299) and assessed whether CS-induced NOX activation is their target. Using an in vitro invasion assay, we found that treatment of NSCLC cells with CS condensate (CSC) increased the migration of NSCLC cells in a dose-dependent manner, via enhancing NOX mediated-reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Treatment of NSCLC cells with GSPs inhibited the cell migration via reduction in ROS accumulation or oxidative stress and subsequent reduction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. To examine the molecular targets of GSPs, we studied the effect of GSPs on CSC-induced alterations in the levels of key NOX components, namely, p22phox and p47phox, using A549 cells. We also determined the effect of GSPs on CSC-induced interaction between p22phox and p47phox proteins, a key event in NOX activation. Our results indicate that treatment of A549 cells with GSPs not only reverse CSC-induced expression levels of p22phox and p47phox, but also inhibit CSC-induced NOX activation by decreasing the binding of p22phox and p47phox proteins. This new insight into the anti-lung cancer cell migration activity of GSPs could serve as a basis for chemoprevention or therapy of advanced stage of lung cancer in human patients.']",

Gene fusions involving the tyrosine kinases ALK, ROS and RET are found in 5 - 10% of NSCLC patients and are considered as oncogenic drivers. However, the cellular signaling activated downstream of oncogenic fusions has not been systematically investigated and it remains unclear if different fusions induce specific targetable signaling patterns.In this study we have employed quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based phosphoproteomics to systematically characterize the signaling induced by oncogenic fusions frequently found in NSCLC. To this end, cDNA sequences of oncogenic fusions containing the tyrosine kinases ALK, ROS and RET and different fusion partners were constructed and ectopically expressed in HEK 293 and lung cancer cell lines. Subsequently, tyrosine phosphorylated peptides were enriched and identified by LC-MS. Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture was employed to precisely quantify the abundance of phosphorylation sites in cells expressing different oncogenic fusions.Our data demonstrate that all investigated oncogenic fusions induce massive tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins and lead to increased phosphorylation of the majority of all quantified phospho-tyrosine sites. For instance, we quantified 1300 unique phosphotyrosine sites from HEK 293 cells expressing EML4-ALK. Of those, 952 increased more than 4-fold in abundance. Comparative analyses of the signaling patterns allowed defining kinase-specific phosphorylation signatures. In addition, comparison of signaling patterns induced by different fusions permitted us to investigate the contribution of the non-kinase fusion partner to the downstream signaling. We were able to identify several phosphorylation events that were associated with specific non-kinase fusion partners. For example, kinase fusions containing the kinesin-1 heavy chain (KIF5B) specifically led to phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins, including cytoskeleton-associated protein 5 (CKAP5). We are currently investigating the functional role of these phosphorylation events for the oncogenic transformation.In summary, we demonstrate that MS-based phosphoproteomics is a powerful tool to investigate aberrant signaling induced by oncogenic fusions in non-small cell lung cancer. Importantly, we find that the kinases involved in the oncogenic fusions largely define the downstream signaling and that the investigated fusion partners only exhibited a minor effect on the downstream signaling.']",

This pathway drives increased expression of SOD2, a superoxide dismutase that clears mitochondrial ROS to protect against cell death. Targeting Gal-3 with a clinically active drug decreases macropinocytosis and increases ROS to eradicate KRAS-addicted lung cancer in patient-derived xenografts and spontaneous KRAS-driven lung cancer in mice. Our work reveals Gal-3 as a druggable target for KRAS-addicted lung cancer, and indicates integrin αvβ3 as a biomarker to identify this dependence.']",

Mutations in EGFR, HER2 and BRAF, specific translocations of ALK, ROS1, RET and amplification of MET all have standard diagnostic importance and lead to specific treatment options for the individual LAC patients. Recently, in 2-4% of LAC MET gene mutations leading to skipping of exon 14 were found. These mutations were described to occur more frequently in tumors with sarcomatoid histology. LAC with MET exon 14 skipping mutations showed impressive, although temporary, responses to MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) crizotinib, cabozantinib and capmatinib. We will present our experience with routine molecular diagnostic detection of the most common MET exon 14 skipping mutations. Methods', ' In January 2016 we included in our standard, DNA based, molecular diagnostics custom-made NGS analyses 4 amplicons for detection of MET skipping mutations. The analyses were performed on microdissected FFPE tissue sections or routine histology or cytology stained preparations. Nine different mutations were validated for their effect on splicing by RT-PCR on RNA isolated from the same tissue samples. Results', ' Between January 2016 and January 2017 676 routine molecular diagnostic analyses on LAC were performed.

Unfortunately, resistance to TKIs inevitably occurs within years of treatment. The emergence of resistance mutations and bypass receptor tyrosine kinase tracks have been implicated in targeted therapy resistance, however, a large proportion of patients who relapsed on TKIs do not harbor resistance mutations or additional receptor tyrosine kinase tracks. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is generally recognized as a transcriptional factor which encodes metabolic enzymes and mediates biochemical response to environmental xenobiotic pollutants. However, the association of AhR and sensitivity to targeted therapy has not been reported and the molecular mechanism of resistance to targeted therapy remains to be elucidated. By analyzing TCGA database and immunohistochemistry staining of relapsed biopsy samples, we identified that dysregulation of AhR conferred resistance to TKIs. qPCR and Western blot screening of a panel of NSCLC cell lines suggested that the AhRlow cells were sensitive to EGFR TKIs, whereas the AhRhigh cells did not. Simultaneously inhibition of AhR and EGFR signaling restored the sensitivity to EGFR TKIs in the AhRhigh cells. Moreover, overexpression of AhR also led to resistance to ALK and ROS1 TKIs by restoring phosphorylation of Akt and Erk. Measurement of endogenous AhR ligand content by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated that the patients had more kynurenine (Kyn) in their serum after disease relapse and progression. The AhR-associated targeted therapy resistance did not require its transcriptional activity because the AhRΔNLS truncated mutant also drives resistance. By using large scale shRNAs screening, we showed that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src phosphorylated Akt and Erk and mediates AhR-associated targeted therapy resistance. Bioinformatics analysis and immunoprecipitation assay showed that Src immediately underwent phosphorylation upon AhR ligands treatment through interacting with the SH2 domain of AhR. The phospho-protein kinase array and in vitro kinase assay revealed that Jak2 kinase directly phosphorylated Src, in which the liganded AhR provided docking sites for Jak2 and Src interaction. Collectively, our study revealed an uncovered, transcription-independent function of AhR. The liganded AhR recruits Src and provides docking sites for Jak2-Src interaction, in which the phosphorylated Src acts as a resistance bypass track. Kyn content might be a biomarker to predict resistance to targeted therapy and targeting AhR helps to overcome resistance.']",

Their stemness properties could be activated by stress-induced cell plasticity but the mechanisms remain to be studied. Calcium signaling is important for integrating cell responses to intra- and extracellular stresses. The role of its downstream pathway, calcineurin/NFAT, in lung TIC has not been explored. This study investigated the role and mechanisms of calcineurin/NFAT in regulating TIC and drug resistance by analyzing NFATc2 expression in multiple TIC populations and functional evaluation using in vitro and in vivo models. In tumor spheres and TIC isolated by marker-based flow cytometry, NFATc2 showed overexpression and higher luciferase reporter activities. Knockdown of NFATc2 reduced TIC marker proportions and suppressed TIC properties including pluripotency genes expression, sphere formation, cell mobility and drug resistance in vitro. Xenograft models and limiting dilution assay showed shNFATc2 effectively suppressed tumorigenesis and reduced TIC frequency. Stable NFATc2 knockdown sensitized tumors to cisplatin and gefitinib treatment. In contrast, TIC-supportive effects were observed in vitro and in vivo when NFATc2 was overexpressed. Further, NFATc2 was activated in stable gefitinib or cisplatin resistant cell lines, and knockdown of NFATc2 sensitized them to drug treatment. These data implicated NFATc2 is involved in lung TIC maintenance and drug resistance. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms of how NFATc2 mediate these roles, we analyzed pluripotency genes and observed a significant correlation between NFATc2 and SOX2 expression in lung cancer cell lines and human lung carcinomas. Computational analysis predicted NFATc2 binding sequences in SOX2 regulatory regions. Detailed studies including luciferase reporter assay, site-directed mutagenesis and CHIP-qRCR confirmed NFATc2 could regulate SOX2 expression through binding to its enhancer. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry on human lung cancers showed significant correlation between expressions of SOX2 and the anti-oxidative stem cell marker ALDH, suggesting SOX2 regulates ALDH expression. In vitro, NFATc2 knockdown suppressed ALDH1A1 expression but it was rescued by SOX2 overexpression. Vice versa, ALDH1A1 was upregulated in NFATc2 overexpressing cells but this was prevented by SOX2 knockdown. Functionally, reactive oxidative species (ROS) levels assessed by flow cytometry were suppressed by activated NFATc2/SOX2/ALDH1A1 axis, while treatment with the ROS inhibitor N-acetylcysteine reversed the sensitization of shNFATc2 on cisplatin treatment. Together, the data showed NFATc2 is involved in the regulation of TIC phenotypes in lung cancer. It increases drug resistance by ROS scavenging mediated by the SOX2/ALDH1A1 axis.']",

Here, we report a new treatment strategy to overcome such drug resistance by selectively inducing EGFRT790M degradation via specific stimulation of methionine 790 (M790) oxidation. The basal reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in EGFRT790M containing gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines were substantially high and 63 clinical lung tumors showed higher NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) expression than 61 normal lung tissues which may contribute to high basal ROS in cancer. Interestingly, only NOX3 was upregulated by sanguinarine, a pharmacological agent to elevate ROS, resulted in EGFR over-oxidation and degradation as well as apoptosis. By contrast, such responses were lacking in EGFRWild-type (WT) cells, suggesting a new promising drug development strategy with wide therapeutic window between EGFRT790M and EGFRWT. Selective EGFRT790M degradation was manipulated by REDOX imbalance between NOX3 and methionine reductase (MsrA).

Furthermore, the in vivo tumor suppression effect of sanguinarine, NOX3 upregulation and EGFR degradation were confirmed.

Recent NGS studies have shown a significant number of mutations in the KEAP1-NRF2-ARE signaling pathway, implicating aberrant activation of this pathway in lung cancer carcinogenesis and chemoresistance. The SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, employing eitherBRG1 or BRM as a catalytic subunit, regulates gene expression and alters chromatin structures in an ATP-dependent manner. Loss of complex function often occurs in lung cancers, via mutations in complex subunits. Since KEAP1/NRF2 mutations and BRG1/BRM loss occur frequently in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) in a mutually exclusive fashion, we hypothesized that BRG1 and/or BRM play(s) a role in the regulation of NRF2 target genes. To test this hypothesis, we developed a series of isogenic H358 NSCLC lines with reduced BRG1 and/or BRM expression using shRNA technology. We observed a significant increase in the levels of HMOX1 (heme oxygenase1) and GSTM4 (GlutathioneS-transferase Mu 4) with a concomitant decrease in NQO1 (NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1) in the BRG1-deficient H358 cell lines. However, GCLM (Glutamatecysteine ligase regulatory subunit) was elevated only in the BRM-reduced H358 cells. Interestingly, BRG1 loss, either alone or combined with BRM loss, promoted SDS-resistant KEAP1 dimerization. We are currently examining whether BRG1 and/or BRM loss increases ROS levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed that NRF2 were enriched at NRF2 downstream genes in both H358 parental and vector control cells, whereas BRG1 knockdown led to a moderate increase (HMOX1) or decrease (NQO1) in NRF2 binding. These results provide evidence that loss ofSWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex activity alters the NRF2 pathway in NSCLC.Furthermore, novel drugs targeting NRF2 downstream genes might provide a therapeutic approach for BRG1 deficient NSCLC patients.']",

Combined with genipin and rapamycin have a synergistic effect with more cellular apoptosis in A549, H460 and CL1-0 cells. The similar phenomenon was found in the combination treatment with genipin and everolimus or BGT226 (a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor) in this three lung cancer cells.

KRAS mutation is s major driver oncogene in NSCLC. Constitutive activation of K-Ras via oncogenic mutations plays a key role in development and progression of NSCLC, and is an important target for drug development. Indeed, drugs that target RAF-MAPK and PI3K, the well-established downstream pathways of K-Ras, are being evaluated in the clinic. However, to date, no effective treatments specifically targeting K-Ras have reached the clinic. A new direction for anti-Ras therapies targeting Ras-mediated altered cellular metabolism is implied by recent studies. Hence, as an attempt to investigate novel therapeutic targets to suppress KRAS-driven NSCLC, we assessed metabolic changes in NSCLC cell line and mouse model systems with oncogenic K-Ras mutations. We show that activation of Ras causes metabolic alterations, leading to aerobic glycolysis. Interestingly, despite the changes in the glycolytic pathway, NSCLC cell line and mouse models carrying K-Ras mutation revealed an elevated mitochondrial membrane potential, superoxide production as well as maximal oxygen consumption rate. Moreover, blockade of mitochondrial respiration effectively reduced mutant KRas-driven neoplastic phenotypes in NSCLC cell lines vitro and lung tumor formation in vivo. In contrast, blockade of glycolysis was not effective in the mutant KRas-driven tumorigenic activities. Mechanistically, mutant KRas-mediated activation of Akt2 led to increased expression of succinate dehydrogenase subunit A (SDHA) through increased protein stability by blocking proteasome-mediated degradation, resulting in mitochondrial complex II-dependent respiration. Our study suggests that induction of mitochondrial complex II-dependent respiration is an important mechanism by which oncogenic mutant KRas induces metabolic changes and ROS stress in NSCLC cells, contributing to lung carcinogenesis.

Testing rates for EGFR were 67% in 2013, 80% 2014 and 69% 2015 (similar pattern with other mut). In never/passive smokers EGFR testing rate was 84% (47% pos for mut); 70% former smokers tested (13% pos); current 64% tested (5% pos) (p < 0.001 testing by smoking). KRAS testing performed in 32% with 31% pos, but did not triage genotyping (97% KRAS pos pts were tested for EGFR).

Similar rates of NGS testing were observed among oncologists caring for > 10 pts or < 10 pts (15% vs 16%). 31 pts (5%) underwent second biopsy to obtain tissue for genotyping. Insufficient tissue was cited by 8%, with other documentation for non-testing lacking. Actionable EGFR/ALK findings were identified in 107 pts (22% tested); 73% of these received TT; 6% started chemo prior to test results (median 26 days vs 22 days who received TT; p = 0.36); 10% no treatment (7% early deaths).

        "Background":"[\"The growing trend to make cancer treatment more precise depends on the accurate identification of clinically actionable genomic alterations within a patient's tumor. Fusion proteins that result from genomic rearrangements are attractive therapeutic targets because they are tumor-specific and cancer cells depend on their expression for survival. The goal of this study was to investigate the breadth of genomic rearrangements in 19 genes shown to be fused in at least one solid cancer across a collection of 5,917 tumors from a diverse variety of subtypes. All tumor samples were submitted to a CLIA-certified CAP-accredited laboratory (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge MA) for next-generation sequencing-based genomic profiling of 3,769 exons from 236 cancer related genes and 47 introns of 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. We observed 350 genomic rearrangements in 338 samples from 82 different solid tumor pathologies. Rearrangements involving kinases were observed in 176 samples (3% of total samples). We identified potentially druggable rearrangements of BRAF (n=13 unique partners; 9 pathologies), ALK (n=11 unique partners; 11 pathologies), FGFR2 (n=9 unique partners; 6 pathologies), ROS1 (n=7 unique partners ; 3 pathologies), RET (n=7 unique partners; 5 pathologies), FGFR3 (n=5 unique partners; 6 pathologies), NTRK1 (n=3 unique partners; 3 pathologies), ERBB2 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies), and ERBB3 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies). ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK1 fusions in lung cancer have all shown sensitivity to targeted agents in patients. The largest number of genomic rearrangements (n=87) was found in lung adenocarcinoma (12% of cases). Interestingly, we identified a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion in a triple negative breast cancer sample, a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion in glioblastoma, a KIF5B-RET fusion in ovarian cancer, and an NCOA4-RET fusion in colon adenocarcinoma. These fusions have been identified previously in pilocytic astrocytoma, myeloid malignancies, lung cancer and thyroid cancer, respectively, but have rarely been reported outside of these diseases; importantly, hypereosinophilic syndromes harboring FIP1L1-PDGFRA are sensitive to imatinib, and lung cancers with KIF5B-RET are sensitive to cabozantinib. Collectively, these data demonstrate that gene fusions exist across a multitude of tumor types and that known fusions are not always confined to the disease in which they appear most often. These rearrangements include clinically actionable fusions which may identify tumors that are sensitive to selective FDA-approved targeted agents.\"]",

        "Meeting_name":" Cisplatin resistant non small cell lung cancer is sensitive to arginine deprivation therapy",
        "Background":"['Drug resistance is a major obstacle to cancer chemotherapy. Despite early positive response to platinum-based chemotherapy, the majority of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) develops resistance. We have previously shown that all cisplatin resistant (CR) cell lines exhibit high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production which leads to alteration in tumor metabolism. We and others have shown that CR cells have low or no expression of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) when compared to their parental cells. Since ASS is a key enzyme to synthesize arginine from citrulline, lack of ASS expression will make arginine an essential amino acid for these CR tumors. Certain NSCLC cell lines/tumor samples also express very low levels of ASS; however, it is unclear how this expression will be affected by cisplatin treatment. In this report, we investigate the underlying mechanism using 6 pairs of NSCLC cell lines and their CR variants', ' H460/H460CR, F/FCR, S/SCR, A549/A549CR, H1299/H1299CR, and H23/H23CR. Note that H460, F, S are ASS(+) and A549, H1299, H23 are ASS(-). No ASS expression due to hypermethylation was found in H1299, while in A549 and H23, it is most likely due to transcription regulation which governs ASS expression, as we have been previously reported in melanoma. All these CR cells possess at least 7 fold resistances to cisplatin and express 3-5 fold increase in ROS levels when compared to parental cell counterparts. CR cells, derived from parental cells that possess high ASS expression, exhibited significantly lower levels of ASS once they became resistant to cisplatin. These CR cells were also hypersensitive to arginine deprivation using ADI-PEG20 (provided by Polaris Inc) which degrades arginine to citrulline. Importantly, the addition of 50ng/ml of ADI-PEG20 restored cisplatin sensitivity to CR cells. With the combination of cisplatin and ADI-PEG20, the ID50 dosage of cisplatin decreased (5-7 fold) to the original levels as their parental counterparts. When compared with cisplatin alone treatment, the percentage of cells with caspase activation increased from 5% (2ug/ml of cisplatin) to 70% (combination with ADI-PEG20). However, in three pairs of CR cells derived from ASS(-) cells, the ASS remains negative in H1299CR while in A549CR and H23CR the ASS expression showed 1-1.5 fold increase both at mRNA and protein levels. Nevertheless, the addition of ADI-PEG20 still can sensitize these CR cells to cisplatin treatment. To further verify the role of ASS in cisplatin resistance, we have overexpressed ASS into SCR cell line and determine the sensitivity to cisplatin. This transfectant became resistant to ADI-PEG20, but maintains similar levels of cisplatin resistance. These data suggest that silencing ASS in these CR cells is most likely a consequence of other biochemical changes occurring in CR cells. These metabolic alterations can be used to target CR lung cancer. Supported by Department of Veterans Affairs, CDA2 award (1K2BX001289).']",

SAHA inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells, and induced a G2/M phase arrest and apoptotic cell death in these cancer cells. In contrast, SAHA did not significantly inhibit the growth of normal lung cells and induce apoptotic cell death. Concerning the oxidative stress, SAHA increased ROS levels in lung cancer cells and induced glutathione (GSH) depletion. Moreover, it decreased the expression level of Trx1 in lung cancer cells. While the overexpression of Trx1 attenuated death and GSH depletion in SAHA-treated lung cancer cells, the downregulation of Trx1 intensified those in these cells. In addition, SAHA increased miR-629 level in lung cancer cells. The mRNA level of Trx1 was decreased by SAHA. Furthermore, the 3 UTR region of Trx1 was regulated by miR-629. In conclusion, SAHA inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells via cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The growth inhibition was related to the levels of Trx1 and miR-629.

        "Background":"['For the past three decades, there are no drugs which could reverse cisplatin resistance or selectively kill these resistant cells. We have discovered that cisplatin resistant (CR) lung cancer shares one common factor which is increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Decreased intracellular thioredoxin-1(TRX1) due to excessive secretion was found in vitro and in vivo, as well as in patients’ serum which could be a primary contributory factor to higher mitochondria-ROS levels. Furthermore, CR cells possess significantly increased number of mitochondria and consume higher rates of oxygen. Key glycolytic enzymes (HKII and LDHA) and lactate production were decreased in CR cells which suggests rewiring of tumor metabolic pathways. NAD+, crucial co-factor of all redox systems, is significantly reduced in all CR cells. Importantly, treatment with riluzole (the FDA approved drug that interferes with cystine/glutamate pump and results in reduced intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels) led to further decrease in NAD+ and LDHA, as well as heightened oxidative stress in CR cells. ROS levels were increased (2-3X) more in resistant cells after riluzole treatment while no significant change occurred in parental cells. The ID50 dosage of parental cells were 3-4 fold more than theirs CR cell counterparts and no cytotoxicity were found in normal lung fibroblast (n=8; p<0.05). Addition of 200 µM NAD+ re-stabilized LDHA, reduced ROS, and reversed riluzole induced cell death. To further determine whether LDHA correlates with ROS levels and sensitivity to riluzole, we inhibited LDHA expressions in parental cell lines S and H460 using siRNA. Lactate productions were decreased in knockdown cells and further attenuated upon riluzole treatment when compared with scrambled control. Higher basal levels of ROS were obtained from S+siLDHA and H460+siLDHA and further increased in ROS levels were observed when treated with riluzole. We then evaluated the viability of these cells under riluzole treatment. Both siLDHA clones were sensitive to riluzole particularly in S+siLDHA which showed 4 fold more sensitivity. Importantly, treatment of riluzole also led to further decrease in LDHA expressions at both protein and mRNA levels. Using riluzole in 2 mouse xenograft models (H460CR (KRAS mutant) and SC (wt)) resulted in completely disappeared in wild type mice and were significant reduced in KRAS mutant mice (n=5 per treatment group; p<0.002).

Because LKB1 is the master kinase phosphorylating the energy-sensing kinase AMPK, dysregulation of the LKB1-AMPK signaling axis causes loss of cellular homeostasis in response to metabolic inhibition or external stress-induced mitochondrial insults. Erlotinib is used clinically in NSCLC patients to target mutationally activated EGFR and is known to induce mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. We investigated the metabolic response and mitochondrial function of LKB1-deficient NSCLC cells treated with erlotinib. LKB1-deficient cells exhibited enhanced sensitivity to erlotinib treatment in vitro and in vivo despite having wild-type EGFR. We found that this enhanced response was due to altered energetic metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in LKB1-deficient cells, which prevents homestatic maintenance of ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in response to erlotinib treatment. Despite negative regulation of mTOR activity by LKB1-AMPK signaling, erlotinib effectively blocked mTOR signaling in LKB1-deficient cells, resulting in inhibition of cell growth, as well as activation of apoptosis.

Furthermore, we identified deregulated c-myc, Nanog, Oct3/4, p53, Rb, EGFR, MAPK, Jun-B, p63, Trim29, Rhov, CDK1, and IGF1 in mouse lung SCCs, and identified reduced IKK and IB and increased ROS1 in mutant lungs and SCCs, some of which were found in human lung SCCs. Lung cancers were prevented by reintroducing epithelial-cell IKK, depleting macrophages or depleting lymphocytes.

        "Background":"['Cisplatin resistance remains a major problem in the treatment of lung cancer. We have discovered that cisplatin resistant (CR) lung cancer cells, regardless of the KRAS mutation status, share one common parameter which is increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) when compared to their parental cells counterpart. Importantly, we found that CR cells were no longer addicted to the glycolytic pathway, but rather relied on oxidative metabolism (OXMET) for energy and biosynthesis. Thus, alteration in mitochondria which resulted in metabolic changes and higher basal levels of ROS may be one of the major factors contributing to cisplatin resistance. We have investigated mitochondrial morphology in parental vs. CR cells using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Our data clearly showed that CR cells possessed significantly higher number of mitochondria per total cell area (n = 4; p = 0.0006). CR cells also consumed 2-4 fold more oxygen when compared to their parental cells. To further confirm that oxidative phosphorylation was utilized more in CR cells, we assayed mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) using TMRE staining. MMP was significantly higher in CR cells suggesting that CR cells possess highly active mitochondria. Key glycolytic enzymes hexokinase II (HKII) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), as well as lactate production were decreased in all CR cell lines which corresponded to the resistance to glycolytic inhibitor, 2DG (n = 8; p<0.03). Moreover, CR cells were highly sensitive to glutamine deprivation. Glutamine withdrawal for 72h resulted in 75-80% cell death in CR cells while only 10-15% cell death occurred in parental cells. CR also take up twice as much L-[G-3H] glutamine when compared to its parental counterpart (n = 4, p<0.05). Here, using Riluzole (the FDA approved drug that interferes with cystine/glutamate pump and results in reduced intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels), can selectively kill CR cells. ROS levels were increased (2-3X) more in resistant cells after Riluzole treatment while no significant change occurred in parental cells. The ID50 dosage of parental cells were 3-4 fold more than theirs CR cell counterparts and no cytotoxicity were found in normal lung fibroblast (n = 8; p<0.05). However, antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 0.1mM), cannot completely abort cell death by Riluzole suggesting other mechanisms are involved. Importantly, Riluzole is also effective in 2 mouse xenograft models (H460CR (KRAS mutant) and SC (wt)). Tumors completely disappeared in wild type mice and were significant reduced in KRAS mutant mice (n = 5 per treatment group; p<0.002). We conclude that addiction to glutamine instead of glucose and higher basal ROS levels seen in CR cells can make them hypersensitive to Riluzole. Repurpose this drug should be considered for future treatment of CR lung cancer patients. Supported by Department of Veterans Affairs, CDA2 award (1K2BX001289) and Woman Cancer Association Fund.']",

Piperlongumine (PPLGM), a natural product of the plant Piper longum has shown potent anti-carcinogenic properties through an ROS-inducing mechanism. Our hypothesis is that PPLGM will sensitize tumor cells to radiation-induced cell death in an orthotopic murine model of lung cancer. Methods', ' 7-week old female C57BL/6 mice were injected intravenously with 1106 Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells. Mouse cohorts (n = 30/group) were administered PPLGM (1 mg/kg of body weight) or vehicle daily by oral gavage initiated 7 days post-LLC injection. At 14 days post-LLC injection, 15 mice per treatment cohort were exposed to 12 Gy thoracic X-ray radiation treatment (XRT). Administration of PPLGM or vehicle continued 7 days post-XRT. Mice were euthanized 14 days post-XRT and evaluated for total lung weight and tumor burden using morphometric analysis. Additionally, we assessed the potential for a dual role of PPLGM (0.1-2.5M) as a radiosensitizer of cancer cells (LLC) and a radioprotector of normal lung cells (pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVEC)) via clonogenic survival assays. Results', ' Using LC/MS/MS we were able to detect significantly elevated levels of PPLGM above baseline in mouse plasma and lung tissue. We observed a significant (p<0.01) increase in lung weight (from 0.14 g to 0.36 g), an indicator of tumor burden, that was significantly (p<0.01) reduced by exposure to a tumoricidal dose of XRT. Importantly, while thoracic XRT-alone reduced tumor burden by 48%, administration of PPLGM+XRT radiosensitized tumor and enhanced tumor killing by XRT, leading to a significant (p<0.05) 56% reduction in lung weight. Morphometric analysis of lung sections confirmed that PPLGM-alone significantly (p<0.01) reduced tumor area relative to vehicle, irrespective of radiation exposure. While exposure to XRT significantly (p<0.01) reduced tumor volume by 65% (from 44.4  7.6% to 15.4  4.5% tumor area), lung sections from mice exposed to PPLGM+XRT significantly (p<0.05) potentiated radiation-induced tumor eradication (reduction in tumor area to 5.6  3.0%) above XRT-only exposure. Furthermore, PPLGM significantly (p<0.05) radiosensitized LLC dose-dependently to gamma-radiation killing, while trending towards radioprotecting normal lung cells.

        "Background":"['The oncoprotein Mucin-1 (MUC1) plays multiple roles in the development of different human tumors. However, whether MUC1 is involved in acquired chemoresistance, a major challenge in cancer therapy, has not been determined. Using a lung cancer cell model with acquired apoptosis resistance (AR)-associated chemoresistance, we investigated the role and mechanism of MUC1 in acquired chemoresistance. MUC1 expression was substantially increased in cells with acquired apoptosis resistance and knockdown of MUC1 expression effectively increased sensitivity of the AR cells to apoptotic cytotoxicity induced by anticancer therapeutics, substantiating a role for MUC1 in acquired chemoresistance. Decreased hydrogen peroxide-reducing enzyme catalase and increased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were found to be associated with MUC1 overexpression. Pharmacological ROS scavengers or exogenous catalase dramatically suppressed MUC1 expression, suggesting catalase suppression-mediated ROS accumulation contributes to MUC1 overexpression. Further, we found miR-551b expression was increased in the AR cells. Knockdown of miR-551b restored catalase expression, and suppressed ROS accumulation and MUC1 expression. Finally, with manipulation of MUC1 expression, we found MUC1 promotes EGFR-mediated activation of the cell survival Akt/c-FLIP/Cox2/Mcl-1 cascade and stabilization of anti-apoptosis factors c-IAP1 and c-IAP2. Thus, our results establish a role for MUC1 in acquired chemoresistance and a pathway consisting of miR-551b/catalase/ROS for MUC1overexpression, and interventions against this pathway may be exploited for overcoming acquired chemoresistance.']",

Methods', ' DNA alterations from 44,065 samples that underwent CGP as part of standard clinical care were classified using logistic regression based on mutational profiles and select clinical features. Results', ' We first trained a logistic regression classifier to identify non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) with alterations in EGFR, ERBB2, BRAF, MET, KRAS, ALK, RET, or ROS1 (lung gene set).

With only an expected 16% relative 5-year survival rate in the U.S., treatment of this aggressive and progressive disease continues to remain a fundamental problem. Moreover, resistance to chemotherapy is a major problem in cancer treatment. In an attempt to overcome drug resistance and improve treatment efficacy, new molecular targeted drugs are being developed and tested in clinical studies. Over the recent years various epidemiological studies have provided compelling evidence for the chemopreventive/therapeutic efficacies of various functional foods and natural products. We hypothesize that non-toxic natural compounds such as a native mixture of blueberry anthocyanidins (BB anthos) and withaferin A (WFA), alone and in combination with a suboptimal dose of the chemo drug paclitaxel (PAC) will have therapeutic response and also chemosensitize the lung cancer cells. We evaluated whether BB anthos could enhance the sensitivity of H1299 cells to PAC and reduce its effective dose to inhibit cell proliferation. Data show significantly enhanced cell death by PAC at a suboptimal concentration (1 nM) (IC50  40 nM) when combined with 5 M (25% vs. 5% inhibition) and 10 M (49% vs. 5% inhibition) BB anthos (1', '1 mixture of Dp, Cy, Mv, Pe and Pt). The significant inhibition of H1299 lung cancer xenografts in nude mice was also evident from the same combination, while no significant growth inhibition was observed with the individual entities. Since BB is a known antioxidant, we determined if BB anthos would attenuate oxidative stress-induced by PAC in H1299 lung cancer cells by measuring intracellular ROS production. Our data showed that addition of BB anthos (10 M each) did not affect the ROS levels produced by PAC (10 nM), as determined by cell permeable fluorescence probe DCFH-DA. Similarly, we also determined the antiproliferative potential of WFA alone and in combination with chemo drugs, PAC and docetaxel (DOC) against non-small-carcinoma lung cancer cells. WFA demonstrated high antiproliferative activity against the growth of both H1299 and A549 cells as determined by MTT assay. When suboptimal concentrations of WFA were tested in combination with suboptimal concentration of DOC and PAC, significantly enhanced antiproliferative activities were observed against H1299 and A549 compared with individual entities. The combination effect was found to be synergistic as analyzed using the CalcuSyn software.

Initial screening has been completed on 130 patients, with the remaining 70 underway. The mean age of the patients enrolled is 61.7 years, 58.5% are female, and 8.5% are never smokers. In profiling the first 130 African American patients, we find that only 28% of patients (N = 36) carry a known somatic mutation that is not present in the germline, far lower than the 41% reported in white patients in our previous studies. Of the identified mutations, approximately 23.8% are KRAS and 23.8% are PT53 alterations. The next most frequent somatic alterations are in EGFR (16.7%). The remaining alterations occurred in only 1 or 2 tumors and include EPHA3, ERBB2, FGFR1, MET, NOTCH1, NRAS, NTRK2, PIK3CA, PTEN, RET and STK11. Five percent of patients have tumors with two driver mutations. Half of the tumors carrying 2 driver mutations had concurrent alterations in KRAS and TP53. Patients with known genetic alterations were more likely to be female than patients with no known genetic alterations (p = 0.42), but did not differ in age, smoking status, pack-years, family history of lung cancer, history of COPD, stage at diagnosis or histology. Mutations in EGFR were responsible for the differences by sex. Exome sequencing is complete for the first 48 of the 92 patients with no known somatic mutations. Sequences are being aligned using Novoalign and GATK will be used for variant calling; results will be available soon. Genetic profiling of NSCLC in African Americans has the potential to both identify novel mutations, expanding the list of potential targets for tailored treatments, and aid clinical decision making in African American patients leading to improvements in outcomes.']",

        "Background":"['The metabolic alterations that are essential for cancer progression remain largely unknown. Previously, we have identified adenylate kinase 4 (AK4) as a marker for poor clinical outcome that promotes metastasis of lung cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of AK4-induced phenotype remains elusive. By microarray analysis, we found downstream targets of HIF1- were differentially regulated upon AK4 overexpression in CL1-0 lung cancer cells. Furthermore, AK4 overexpression induces glycolysis and results in accelerated glucose consumption, ATP utilization and lactate production. Overexpression of AK4 also increases the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which exaggerates HIF1- protein expression under hypoxia and concurrently induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in a HIF1--dependent manner. IHC analysis showed an inverse correlation between AK4 and E-cadherin and a positive correlation between AK4 and nuclear HIF1- in lung cancer patients. Moreover, patients with AK4 high/E-Cadherin low showed worse outcome compared to patients with AK4 low/E-cadherin high. Our study indicates that enhanced expression of AK4 is a critical factor to trigger aerobic glycolysis and induced HIF1--mediated EMT in lung cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Tumor resistance to radiation therapy is a significant obstacle that patients and doctors face while treating tumors. Meaningful changes in therapy are contingent upon the ability to identify an unfavorable response very early (first week) in the course of treatment. Optical imaging can perform noninvasive, frequent and quantitative measurements of tumor biology at the point of care. The goal of this study was to identify optically measurable metabolic endpoints in a matched model of radiation resistance before and after treatment. A human lung cancer cell line was induced to develop radiation resistance through repeated exposure to a clinically relevant dose of X-ray radiation (2 Gy). We used a fluorescent glucose analog called 2-NBDG to quantify glucose uptake. We measured the endogenous fluorescence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), metabolic coenzymes found primarily in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, respectively. We determined the redox ratio [FAD/(NADH + FAD)] in both cell lines. We evaluated the behavior of the cellular antioxidant system by comparing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS scavengers, such as glutathione (GSH) for each cell group. Finally, we analyzed the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) using a metabolic flux analyzer.Radiation-resistant A549 lung cancer cells were induced by exposure to 25 fractions of X-ray radiation (2.2 Gy/fraction). Clonogenic assays were performed to confirm radiation resistance. All fluorescence images were obtained using a multiphoton microscope. 2-NBDG, ROS, GSH, NADH, and FAD fluorescence were excited at 960, 930, 780, 755 and 860 nanometers, respectively. The cells were exposed to 2 Gy 60 minutes prior to the Seahorse assay. All experiments were performed in both the parental A549 cell line (A549C) and the radiation-resistant A549 cell line (A549R) at baseline (prior to radiation) and after radiation.At baseline, the A549R cells revealed a significantly lower level of oxidative stress and a higher level of GSH. Interestingly, glucose uptake, quantified using 2-NBDG fluorescence, was significantly lower in the A549R cells compared to the A549C cells at baseline. The redox ratio was significantly higher in the A549R cells prior to radiation, indicating a preference for mitochondrial respiration. However, after radiation, the OCR of the A549R cells was significantly lower than the parental cell line, indicating a lower use of mitochondrial respiration. There were no significant differences in ECAR levels between both cell lines after radiation. Our results indicate that the radiation-resistant A549 lung cancer cells present very distinguishable metabolic properties at baseline and after exposure to radiation relative to the parental cell line that could potentially be exploited in vivo.']",

To date, MET exon 14 skipping by sequencing and MET amplification by FISH have been found to have potential clinical utility in predicting those patients who may derive benefit from MET-targeted therapy. However, little research has been conducted on alternative technologies to FISH such as CISH, which does not require a dark room and can be interpreted by a board-certified pathologist. The purpose of this study is to report our experience with MET amplification across solid tumors using CISH.A retrospective analysis was done on 26,619 specimens analyzed for MET amplification by CISH at a CLIA-certified lab (Caris Life Sciences). The validated CISH assay, previously validated against a FISH assay, utilized a gene copy number > 5 to assess amplification. Concordance and correlative studies were done in MET-amplified, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens analyzed using a cMET IHC (SP44, 2+ or 3+ staining intensity in 50% or more tumor cell membrane) analyzing protein expression. Correlative studies involving co-existing aberrations, including PD-L1 (SP142, any intensity in at least 50% of tumor cells), in this MET-amplified, NSCLC cohort were also performed.MET amplification utilizing CISH was 0.7% (188/26,619) overall. MET-amplified solid tumors included carcinomas such as NSCLC (3.1%, 87/2767), gastric adenocarcinoma (3.8%, 11/293), esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (3.3%, 11/338), and endometrial carcinoma (0.4%, 9/2020) along with non-carcinomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (1.0%, 5/510), uterine sarcoma (1.3%, 5/400), melanoma (0.4%, 2/538), and rare tumors such as placental-site trophoblastic tumor (100%, 1/1) and prostatic neuroendocrine tumor (100%, 1/1). A sub-analysis of MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens demonstrated co-occurring protein overexpression in 92.6% (75/81) of cases. These same MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens were found to have EGFR pathogenic/presumed pathogenic mutations (19.7%, 15/76), ALK rearrangements (2.5%, 2/80), and PD-L1 overexpression (27.5%, 14/51). ROS1 rearrangements were not detected in this NSCLC cohort (0%, 0/76).Our data suggest MET amplification detection utilizing CISH is a viable option for identifying MET-driven cancers. The presence of MET across various solid tumors contrasts with biomarkers like HER2, which are exclusive to carcinomas. A sub-analysis of our NSCLC population shows MET-amplified tumors contains a similar molecular distribution to the general NSCLC population. Future studies should incorporate MET CISH in clinical trials utilizing MET-targeted agents to determine its potential as a predictive test for evaluating who may derive the most benefit.']",

Discrepancies in classification and characterization approaches have resulted in confusions and difficulties in the comparative pathology of mouse and human lung tumors. Currently, there are very few mouse models of spontaneous lung cancer that are available to validate human lung carcinogenesis. Male C57/BL6 x Balb/c F1 (CB6 F1) mice have a high incidence of pulmonary adenocarcinoma that increases with increasing age. For example, 28 month old males have a 52 per cent incidence, while 32 month old males have close to 80 per cent incidence. In order to determine if these tumors were driven by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), we crossed wild type Balb/c females with transgenic males on the C57/BL6 background expressing human catalase targeted to mitochondria (mCAT). The offspring were followed through the end of their lifespan when tissues were collected for histological evaluation. Of 65 males examined, we found that those expressing mCAT had a 29 per cent incidence of lung tumors, while wild type littermates had an incidence of 71 per cent (p  0.01). The presence of mCAT had a similar effect on the incidence of lung tumors in females although the overall incidence was less than in males. Histologically, lung tumors in wild type mice had higher grade malignancy than lung tumors in mice expressing mCAT suggesting that ROS generated by mitochondria might be playing a role in driving this type of cancer in mice. We conclude that spontaneous lung adenocarcinoma in old CB6 F1 mice could be a useful model to study the anti-tumor effect of mitochondrial-targeted anti-oxidants for intervention of human lung cancer.Citation Format', ' Christina Pettan-Brewer, John Morton, Piper Treuting, Warren Ladiges.

        "Background":"['Cisplatin resistance remains a major problem in treating lung cancer. We have discovered that all cisplatin resistant (CR) cells, regardless of their signaling mechanism, possess decreased levels of thioredoxin-1 (TRX1) in vitro and in vivo resulting in higher basal levels of ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) accumulation. Although decreased TRX1 contributes to higher ROS levels in CR cells, we have found that these CR cells also possess elevate number and active mitochondria as evidence by increased oxygen consumption (4x higher than parental cells) and more intense mitochondria specific fluorescence (mitoTracker) as well as significantly higher mitochondrial membrane potential. These factors could also contribute to higher ROS production. Higher mitochondria activity and ROS also suggest that CR cells may rely more on oxidative metabolism (OXMET). We validated the involvement of specific OXMET components as well as the impact of TRX1 on CR cell metabolism. We examined key proteins in the TCA cycle in SCLC1 (parental), SR2 (resistance counterpart), and TRX1 over-expressing SR2 cells (SR2TRX+). We found that citrate synthetase, the first rate determining enzyme in the TCA cycle, is not changed but ATP-citrate lyase levels exhibit a 3fold increase. Fumarase (FH) which participates in the maintenance of succinate and fumarate equilibrium is increased in SR2 (1.8fold), but attenuates in TRX1 transfected cells, SR2TRX+. This finding implies that SR2 produces more fumarate, a known by-product from urea cycle. We then evaluated argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), the two key enzymes in urea cycle which generate arginine. While ASL shows no changes, ASS mRNA is 30fold higher in SR2 compares to SCLC1. These results indicate that SCLC1 require an exogenous arginine supply for their growth while SR2 do not. Indeed, we found that SCLC1 could not withstand arginine free media supplement with citrulline (only 30% of cells survive after 48h). In contrast, SR2 which expressed ASS can survive in arginine free media with 80% of cells still viable at 48h. Importantly, over-expression of TRX1 suppresses ASS in SR2 which in turn sensitizes them to arginine deprivation. It is also known that HIF1 negatively regulates ASS and TRX1 is known to increase HIF1. Thus lower TRX1 found in CR cells most likely increase ASS via decreased HIF1 expression. Here, we found that HIF1 is less in SR2 which may also contribute to decreased glycolysis. To consider this possibility, we assay lactate production and found lower amount of lactic acid in media from CR cells (0.013 vs. 0.009 nM/well/cell, SCLC1 vs. SR2; p=<0.05). Overall, our findings suggest that alteration in tumor metabolism in CR cells is most likely mediated by TRX1 through ROS. These findings may have future clinical application in treating CR patients using agents which generate ROS or target mitochondria.']",

Overall survival (OS) and duration of response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy (EGFR-mutant subgroup) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Outcomes were compared between double-driver and single-driver stage-matched control groups from the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium study (log-rank test).  Results', '  49 patients (55% KRAS-mutant, 39% EGFR-mutant, 2% BRAF-mutant, 2% MAP2K1-mutant, 2% ALK fusion-positive) were found to have a driver in a second gene (PIK3CA 94% or AKT1 6%).

Most recently, ALK targeted therapies have been shown to be effective in ALK positive patients. This may also be true for ROS but is less validated. The ability to identify patients that harbor these fusion proteins is desirable. Currently, molecular assays such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and RT-PCR are used to identify these patients. We reasoned that an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based assay could provide a fast, inexpensive alternative for diagnosing patients with ALK and ROS abnormalities. We have developed an IHC-based assay for the detection of low level ALK and ROS in NSCLC patients with high specificity and sensitivity. Methods', ' We generated highly specific rabbit monoclonal antibodies against ALK and ROS. ALK and ROS antibodies were evaluated in a panel of 656 NSCLC FFPE tumor tissues.

IHC positive tissues were also analyzed by FISH to compare protein expression to the presence of ALK and ROS rearrangements. Results', ' Western blot, IHC and FISH experiments confirm that our monoclonal antibodies can specifically detect low levels of both ROS and ALK in NSCLC tumor samples. Approximately, 4.1% (27 cases) of NSCLC cases analyzed were ALK positive by IHC. We were able to confirm these results by FISH in 25/27 cases. The remaining 2 cases we were unable to score due to poor tissue quality. We identified 2.6% (17/656) of the NSCLC tissues to be ROS positive by IHC. We confirmed these results in 16/17 tissues by FISH analysis. Due to technical issues, we were unable to score the remaining tissue. Both the ALK and ROS antibodies are highly specific.

SCC of the lung and SCC of the head and neck region and esophagus not only share risk factors, morphologic features and mechanisms of tumorigenesis but also frequent fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene alterations.

        "Background":"['Background Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer mortality world wide. The five-year survival rate of stage III and IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is poor with 16%. There is growing evidence that the immune system plays a paradoxical role in the development and progression of lung cancer. It influences tumor incidence, tumor growth, response to therapy, and the prognosis of the disease. Mouse models show that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a role in these processes. MDSCs are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells and myeloid progenitor cells, which are present in the tumor micro-environment and the peripheral circulation of cancer patients. These cells are able to suppress features of immune responses, like T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Aim In the present study we want to determine the role of pivotal immunological populations such as CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, and MDSCs. Methods Fresh blood of 60 stage IV non-squamous-NSCLC patients and 15 healthy controls (HC) was studied. Mononuclear cells were purified from peripheral blood by density gradient centrifugation and analysed by flowcytometry. MDSCs were characterized as CD11b, CD15 CD33 positive and low expression of HLA-DR and CD16 cells. Suppressive activity of MDSCs was measured by CD3-chain expression assays, and reactive-oxygen species (ROS) production using flowcytometry. Also T-cell proliferation assays were performed, in which sorted MDSCs were co-cultured with activated CD8-T-cells to investigate whether the MDSCs could inhibit the T-cell proliferation. Results All patients had a significantly increased MDSC population compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0009). Peripheral blood fractions possessed strong immunosuppressive functions, as shown by a high ROS production by MDSC, a decreased CD3-chain expression in T cells compared to HC. In addition, the CD8+ T-cells showed no proliferation when co-cultured with MDSCs, indicating that MDSCs could block CD8+ -T cell proliferation. The populations of CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells were significantly decreased in lung cancer patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0024, respectively). Conclusion Circulating MDSCs are significantly increased, while CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells are significantly decreased in stage IV non-squamous-NSCLC patients compared to controls. MDSCs suppress the immune system by ROS production, down regulating the CD3-chain expression and thereby inhibiting T-cell proliferation. This suggests that MDSCs may play an important role in disease progression and overall survival. Therefore, further investigation is warranted.']",

The concept that antioxidants can help fight cancer is deeply rooted in the general population, promoted by the food supplement industry, and supported by some scientific studies. However, clinical trials have reported inconsistent results. Here, we show that supplementing the diet with the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or vitamin E markedly increases tumor progression and reduces survival by 50-60% in mouse models of B-RAF- and K-RAS-induced lung cancer. RNA sequencing revealed that NAC and vitamin E, which are structurally unrelated, produce highly coordinated changes in tumor transcriptome profiles, dominated by reduced expression of endogenous antioxidant genes. NAC and vitamin E increase tumor cell proliferation by reducing ROS, DNA damage, and p53 expression in mouse and human lung tumor cells. Inactivation of p53 increases tumor growth to a similar degree as antioxidants and abolishes the antioxidant effect. Thus, antioxidants accelerate tumor growth by disrupting the ROS-p53 axis. Because somatic mutations in p53 occur late in tumor progression, antioxidants may accelerate the growth of early tumors or precancerous lesions in high-risk populations such as smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who receive NAC to relieve mucus production.']",

The unsatisfactory outcomes of lung cancer treatment are related to multiple factors including tumor recrudescence, metastasis, cancer drug resistance, etc. Cancer stem cells are cell subsets within a cancer that excel in tumor properties, especially survival, renewal and resistance to treatment. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are high energy molecules produced during cellular hyperproliferation and cell death. Studies have shown though a low level of ROS is required to support stem cell functions but excessive ROS damages DNA and predisposes to cell death. Therefore, the ability to attenuate oxidative damage from ROS and maintain redox homeostasis is an important property of aggressive and resilient cancer cells. The multifunctional serine/threonine kinase calcium/calmodulin- dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMK2A) is a calcium signaling molecule involved in cell growth and stress signals integration. It has been reported to play a tumor-supportive role in osteosarcoma, prostate cancer and leukemia. However, little is known about the impact and mechanisms of CaMK2A on lung cancer and cancer redox homeostasis. This study aims to investigate the role of CaMK2A in ROS regulation in lung cancer stem cells. We measured ROS levels using H2DCFDA probes in cancer stem cells isolated from two lung cancer cell lines by the known lung cancer stem cell marker CD44 and CD166. Compared to CD44- and CD166- non-stem cells, ROS levels were lower in both CD44+ and CD166+ cancer stem cells. In cancer cells with stable CaMK2A knockdown by shRNA (CaMK2A-KD), ROS was suppressed while CaMK2A overexpression led to ROS elevation, suggesting a potential role of CaMK2A on ROS regulation in lung cancer stem cells. To understand the mechanism, activated NRF2 levels, the master transcription factor mediating ROS regulation, were measured in total nuclear protein extracts. By Western blot, nuclear NRF2 protein showed upregulation in CaMK2A overexpression cells and decreased levels in CaMK2A-KD cells, implying NRF2 might be a mediator of CaMK2A in ROS regulation. To further identify downstream regulators, mRNA expression analysis of five ROS-regulatory NRF2 target genes (GSTP1, NQO1, GCLC, HMOX1, TRXR1) was performed. Quantitative PCR results showed significant corresponding changes of some these gene expressions in cell lines, which upregulated in CaMK2A overexpression and downregulated in both CaMK2A-KD cells and CaMK2A pharmacological inhibition cells.

        "Background":"['All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) have tumor-suppressive capacity by their ability to promote differentiation and inhibit proliferation, mainly in leukemia, however in other tumor types the treatment with ATRA is restricted because not all the patients have the same results. ATRA is able to modulate the PI3K and ERK signaling pathways and promote differentiation in neuronal cells by a transcription independent mechanism. In lung cancer cells this non genomic mechanism by ATRA is able to active the PI3K signaling pathway and trigger cellular processes like invasion and survival. Nevertheless is unknown if ERK could be modulated by ATRA in lung cancer cells. We investigated the effects of ATRA on the activation of ERK pathway in the ATRA-resistant A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line. The phosphorylated form of ERK was detected by western blot within 5 and 15 min after ATRA treatment. Further evaluation using specific RAR antagonists, AGN 193109 and Ro 41-5253, which prevent expression of ATRA target genes, showed the same effect over ERK. To elucidate the potential crosstalk between PI3K and ERK signaling, we used cells pretreated with wortmannin, a potent and specific PI3K inhibitor, and showed that wortmannin alone or in combination with ATRA increased the activation of ERK. These data suggest that PI3K negatively regulate ERK phosphorylation through the signaling complex ATRA/RAR. As we reported previously, ATRA does not induce significant changes on proliferation, however, the combination of ATRA with PD98059, the pharmacological inhibitor of MEK-ERK, decreases proliferation by 50%. These results suggest that activation of ERK is involved in blocking the classical anti-proliferative effects of ATRA in A549 cell line. Moreover, ERK pathway activation promotes anti-apoptosis in response to ATRA treatment in A549 cells. In addition, wound healing assay in presence of PD98059 showed that migration promoted by ATRA in A549 cells can be delayed. Our results indicate that ATRA activates the ERK signaling pathway by a transcription independent mechanism through signaling cascade, which involves RAR and PI3K modulating the ERK activation. This signaling pathway promotes proliferation, survival and migration in lung cancer cells. The inhibition of ERK signaling pathway restores the anti-tumoral effects of ATRA. It is interesting to speculate that using a combination of ERK and PI3K inhibitors may improve the tumor-suppressive activity of ATRA in lung cancer patients.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

Results', ' Mean TML was highest in melanoma (Mel; 21 mt/MB), NSCLC (11 mt/MB), and bladder cancer (BLC; 11 mt/MB), whereas prostate cancer (PC), pancreas adenocarcinoma (PA), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) had the lowest levels (all 6 mt/MB). High TML was seen most frequently in Mel (36%), NSCLC (15%), BLC (15%), and anal cancer (SCCA; 9%); and least frequently in PA (1.6%) and RCC (0.5%). Primary NSCLC carried lower TML than its brain metastases (11 vs. 16 mt/MB, p < 0.001). Older age was associated with higher TML in Mel (p = 0.001), CRC (p = 0.009), breast cancer (BC; p = 0.01), and NSCLC (p = 0.02). Higher TML was seen in males than in females for Mel (p = 0.002) and NSCLC (p < 0.001). Presence of mutations in oncogenic driver genes such as EGFR, ALK, ROS1 RET fusions, cMET exon 14 skipping correlated with lower TML in NSCLC (6.9 vs. 12 mt/MB, p < 0.001), as did BRAF and NRAS mutations in Mel (17 vs. 26, p = 0.003). Conversely, mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as ARID1A (CRC, NSCLC, and BLC) and NF1 (BC, CRC, Mel, BLC, and NSCLC) were associated with higher TML (p < 0.05). MSI-high was correlated with high TML in CRC and gastric cancers (p < 0.05). Conclusions', ' TML varied significantly among different cancers.

        "Background":"['We describe a rapid targeted RNA-seq library construction method for the detection of gene fusions in cancer using next generation sequencing. The method involves ligation of half-functional sequencing adaptors to double strand cDNA, followed by two successive PCR reactions using hemi-nested gene-specific 3 primers with the 5 adaptor primer, and generates libraries ready for bi-directional sequencing. RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsies can be used directly without the need to deplete ribosomal RNA, non-target mRNA or genomic DNA. Importantly, the assay can be performed without the need to know the 5 partner in a gene fusion event. The method can also be applied to genomic DNA for detection of gene mutations, insertions, deletions and copy number changes. The method is very flexible and can allow multiplexing of over 500 targets. We have designed a lung cancer translocation panel which includes 18 amplicons for detections of gene rearrangements involving ALK, ROS1 and RET. For targeted genomic DNA-seq, we have designed a small 96-amplicon panel including tumor hotspots and entire coding sequences of key tumor suppressor genes TP53 and PTEN, and a 623-amplicon panel for 370 exons of 18 tumor suppressor genes. Unlike conventional PCR-based method, this method generates libraries with random sequencing start sites and allows for direct sequencing without having to spiking in controls (e.g. PhiX) on those platforms where high starting site complexity is required, such as the Illumina Miseq sequencer. The assays generally achieve high on-target specificity (>90%), and are very cost-effective. The targeted RNA-seq assay has detected various gene rearrangements in known FISH-positive cases with previously unknown 5 partners using our archived samples. The small 96-amplicon genomic DNA assay showed 100% of targeted bases having >100-fold coverage and 99.9% having >500-fold coverage with minimal optimization. In our first attempt of targeting 370 exons (626 amplicons, target size 52.3 kilobases), this assay achieved 97% of targeted bases having >100-fold coverage and 93% having >500-fold using  of a Miseq sequencing run.']",

Although the role of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) in cell survival signaling is well documented, whether RIP1 is directly involved in cancer development has never been studied. In this report, we found that RIP1 expression is substantially increased in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and cell lines. RIP1 expression in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) was significantly induced by cigarette smoke extract (CSE) or benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), the active form of the tobacco-specific carcinogen benzo (a) pyrene (BaP). In RIP1 knockdown HBECs, BPDE-induced cytotoxicity was significantly increased, which was associated with induction of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mainly hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including JNK, ERK and p38. Scavenging ROS suppressed BPDE-induced MAPK activation and inhibiting ROS or MAPKs substantially blocked BPDE-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting ROS-mediated MAPK activation is involved in BPDE-induced cell death. The H2O2-reducing enzyme catalase is destabilized in an ERK- and JNK-dependent manner in RIP1 knockdown HBECs and application of catalase effectively blocked BPDE-induced H2O2 accumulation and cytotoxicity. Importantly, BPDE-induced transformation of HBECs was significantly reduced when RIP1 expression was suppressed. Altogether, these results strongly suggest an oncogenic role for RIP1, which promotes malignant transformation through protecting DNA-damaged cells against carcinogen-induced cytotoxicity associated with excessive ROS production.']",

But long-term effects of M1 macrophages on cancer cells, especially their tumoricidal activity, remain unclear. In our previous study, conditioned medium (CM) from M1 macrophages can induce A549 apoptosis and senescence, but detail mechanism is unexplored.Materials & MethodsLung cancer cell lines, A549 and H460, are cells with wild-type p53, but H1299 is p53-null. Cytokine and cDNA microarray were used to evaluate the content of M1 macrophages and their effects on A549 cell. Flow cytometry was assessed cell apoptosis; real-time PCR and Western blot were assessed the expression of identified genes and proteins. Clinical statistical analysis for predicting survival of lung cancer patients was applied by a published clinical microarray dataset.ResultsAccording to our previous results of cDNA microarray, several significantly differential genes were the down-stream of p53, the important initiator for apoptosis. After M1 CM treatment, A549 and H460 cells went apoptosis and p53 was abundantly accumulated. But cell death was not observed in H1299 cells, unless exogenous wt-p53 was expressed and M1 CM treated. Another transcription factor STAT1 was also up-expressed at translational and transcriptional levels after M1 CM stimulation. STAT1 may interact and assist with p53 to cause cell death. IFN- which is a well known cytokine for STAT1 activation highly expresses in M1 macrophages, but antibody neutralization can not reverse cell apoptosis. M1 macrophages from human PBMCs also had tumoricidal activity for A549. Moreover, the M1/M2 gene signature from A549 cDNA microarray can predict the patients' survival.Conclusion Accumulated data show that p53 and STAT1 are the main tumoricidal regulators induced by M1 macrophages in long-term culture and that is IFNs independent signaling pathway.

ZEB1 is associated with resistance to conventional chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer and potentially has a predominant role in inducing EMT in NSCLC. However, very little is known about its functional role in the radio-response of NSCLC. We have selected three NSCLC cell lines with high ZEB1 expression (H460, H1299, and Calu-6) and established three matched pair of stable cell lines with and without Zeb1 knockdown (H460/shZeb1 and H460shCV, H1299/shZeb1 and H1299/shCV, Calu6/shZeb1 and Calu6/shCV) using shRNA. The expression of Zeb1, E-cadherin, and vimentin were assessed by western blot analysis, morphological changes associated with EMT phenotype were assessed, and the Zeb1 knocked down cells were tested for radiosensitivity by clonogenic cell survival. Intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subG1-G0 were measured by FACS. The results showed that clear suppression of ZEB1 protein was obtained and reexpression of E-cadherin protein was evident in three stable cell lines with Zeb1 knockdown. Vimentin protein expression were reduced in three stable cell lines with Zeb1 knockdown compared with their non-targeting vector control cell lines respectively.

Moreover, the percentage of subG1-G0 in H460/shZeb1 after radiation (30.9%) was significantly elevated compared to H460/shCV after radiation (11.8%).

        "Background":"['The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is a major regulator of many fundamental processes in mammalian embryonic development. These processes include stem cell maintenance, determination of cell fate, tissue polarity, cell survival, cell differentiation and proliferation. Although this pathway is usually silenced in adult tissues, constitutive activation of the Hh pathway can lead to tumorigenesis. This aberrant characteristic can be observed in different types of human cancer including basal cell carcinomas, medulloblastoma, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, breast and prostate cancer. This pathway has been shown to regulate proliferation of cancer stem cells and increase tumor invasiveness. Targeted inhibition of Hh signaling pathway is shown to be effective in cancer treatment and prevention. Therefore, the discovery of Hh pathway inhibitors can pave the way of finding effective cancer treatments. The steroidal alkaloid cyclopamine was the first compound found to inhibit Hh signaling and has been invaluable for understanding the function of Hh signaling in development and cancer. Cyclopamine tartrate (CycT) is an improved analogue of cyclopamine with increased water solubility and bioavailabilty. We performed numerous experiments to examine the effect of CycT in inhibiting Hh signaling on an array of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lines. We discovered that CycT has a novel activity in disrupting mitochondrial function and aerobic respiration. Our data show that CycT causes a substantial decrease in aerobic respiration of NSCLC cells, similar to the effect of glutamine deprivation. Mitotracker staining showed that CycT causes mitochondrial fragmentation by increasing mitochondrial fission, which is indicated by the localization of DRP1 at fission sites. Further experiments showed that CycT increases ROS generation, which is presumably a consequence of mitochondrial hyperpolarization. Concomitantly, CycT causes apoptosis and suppress proliferation of NSCLC cells.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Activation of autophagy by erlotinib protects NSCLC cells with wild-type EGFR from erlotinib cytotoxicity",
        "Background":"['Erlotinib is an orally available EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor which has significant clinical activity in previously treated patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as in maintenance therapy after frontline chemotherapy. Although it has shown efficacy in NSCLC with both wild-type and mutant EGFR, it is much more effective in tumors with activating EGFR mutations than in those tumors which have wild-type EGFR. This study identifies autophagy induction as a potential mechanism for the relative resistance of wild-type EGFR NSCLC cells to erlotinib. Autophagy is a tightly regulated lysosomal self-digestion process that may promote cell survival and/or be involved in type II cell death. The potential role of autophagy in erlotinib-induced cytotoxicity has not been well defined. We used four wild-type EGFR NSCLC cell lines, which are either erlotinib-sensitive (H322 and H358) or erlotinib-resistant (H460 and A549), to determine if treatment with erlotinib induces autophagy. We then assessed the effect of disrupting autophagy by chemical and genetic approaches on erlotinib-induced cytotoxicity. Erlotinib at a clinically relevant concentration (2 M) induced autophagy, as shown by increased MDC staining, increased conversion of LC3-I (the cytosolic form) to LC3-II (the lapidated form associated with autophagosome), and the formation of autophagic vacuoles, in all tested cell lines. Autophagy induction by erlotinib was greater in resistant cells than in sensitive cells, suggesting that autophagy is a cytoprotective mechanism. This was confirmed with the use of autophagy inhibitors chloroquine (CQ), 3-methyladenine, and bafilomycin A1, which synergistically increased erlotinib cytotoxicity. Similar enhancement was seen with knockdown of Atg-5 and Beclin-1 gene expression. Cotreatment with CQ did not alter erlotinib-induced EGFR signaling inhibition or G1-phase arrest, but markedly activated mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, disrupting autophagy by CQ or other inhibitors enhanced erlotinib-induced upregulation of BIM expression, and knockdown of BIM expression by siRNA attenuated the cytotoxicity induced by the combination. In addition, inhibition of autophagy by CQ enhanced erlotinib-induced ROS generation and activation of p38 but not JNK signaling. Inhibition of ROS generation by N-acetyl-cysteine, or inhibition of p38 by SB202190 attenuated the cytotoxic effect of the combination, suggesting that ROS generation and p38 activation are potential mediators of the synergism observed. The ability to adapt to anti-EGFR therapy by triggering autophagy may be a major determinant of resistance to erlotinib in NSCLC tumors with wild-type EGFR. Inhibition of autophagy by CQ or other inhibitors represents a novel strategy to potentiate erlotinib efficacy in NSCLC tumors with wild-type EGFR.

In principle, massively parallel paired-end sequencing can identify structural rearrangements in tumor genomes and transcriptomes. However, computational methods to identify gene fusions are varied, still evolving and largely trained on cell line data. We sought to develop systematic methods to characterize known oncogenic gene fusions and to discover novel gene fusions in cancer. RNASeq data for approximately 3,400 clinical cases from 16 cancer types was obtained from the Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub) of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We surveyed the performance of several gene fusion callers and chose two (deFuse and TopHat) for further method development. An analysis pipeline was developed and executed in parallel on a high-performance computing cluster. Filtering and annotation was conducted on the aggregated data as a post-processing step, to enable exploratory analyses of various filters. We optimized filtering approaches on datasets that included known standards (e.g., TMPRSS2-ERG in prostate adenocarcinoma, PML-RARA in acute myeloid leukemia, etc.) to enrich for these and other gene fusions with correct 5-3 orientation while excluding cases with ambiguous breakpoints and spanning reads, alignment errors, and read-through transcripts from adjacent genes. Predicted fusions were summarized based on the occurrence of unique genes participating in fusions with multiple partners and of unique gene pairs, each within specific diseases. Elevated expression was observed after the predicted breakpoint of the 3 gene in cases positive for predicted fusions, and added important confirmatory evidence. Thus, we characterized the incidence and distribution of several known oncogenic gene fusions including EML4-ALK and CCDC6-RET while expanding the number of gene partners identified in combination with oncogenes such as ROS1. In addition to characterizing the incidence and distribution of 31 known gene fusions, we nominated over 100 novel gene fusion pairs. One example of a novel gene fusion susceptible to available targeted therapy was FGFR3-TACC3 in 4% of bladder cancer, 2% of squamous cell lung carcinoma, and 1% each of glioblastoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

To find potential therapeutic vulnerabilities, we analyzed the spectrum of genomic alterations in over 700 confirmed glial tumors. Extracted DNA was subjected to hybrid capture for 236 cancer-related genes plus 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer, and sequenced to a median depth of >500x. Resultant sequences were assessed for base substitutions, insertions and deletions, copy number changes, and select rearrangements. Glioblastomas showed frequent alterations in CDKN2A/B (55%), TP53 (40%), PTEN (40%), and EGFR (40%), including EGFRviii (18.6%). Anaplastic astrocytomas harbored frequent alterations in TP53 (65%), IDH1 (55%), and ATRX (51%). Astrocytomas, including both low grade and mixed grade tumors, had a similar genomic landscape to that of anaplastic astrocytomas with frequent alterations in TP53 (53%), IDH1 (45%), and ATRX (36%). In addition to known fusions involving EGFR, FGFR3, and BRAF, we also identified rare, but therapeutically relevant, fusions involving ROS1 and PDGFRA that have been reported exclusively in lung cancer and hypereosinophilic syndrome, respectively. Unsupervised clustering of all glial tumors based on genomic alterations identified six distinct classes each driven by unique combinations of genomic events. Tumors driven by concurrent alterations in IDH1, ATRX, and TP53 were associated with younger age and anaplastic astrocytoma histology (p = 2.21016). The addition of NF1 alterations to IDH1, ATRX, and TP53 mutations was modestly enriched in glioblastoma samples (p = 0.04). Other classes showed distinct drivers (MAPK or PI3K pathway alterations) coupled with unique mechanisms of cell cycle deregulation (CDKN2A/B loss, CDK4/MDM2 amplification, or RB1 alterations). The potential clinical importance of these genomic findings was demonstrated in three patients with surgically confirmed recurrent glioblastoma who received molecularly-matched targeted inhibitors as part of second-line therapy. Patients with activation of EGFR via amplification or mutation (R108K), activation of the mTOR pathway via inactivation of NF1, and constitutive activity of BRAF (V600E) were treated with erlotinib, everolimus, and vemurafenib, respectively, administered in combination with chemotherapy. In all three cases, imaging responses and overall survival were deemed far greater than expected by the treating physician. In conclusion, complex genomic data from glial tumors can be grouped into distinct sub-classes driven by unique combinations of alterations.

In wildtype EGFR cells, gefitinib not only inhibited CID but also failed to induce apoptosis and therefore compromising the efficacy of cisplatin.

        "Background":"['Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women with a median survival time of 8-10 months’ post treatment. Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80% of the lung cancers and the treatment plan is determined based on the active mutations (EGFR, ALK/ROS, and KRAS) present in the tumor. Patients bearing EGFR mutation initially respond to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy and after 10-14 months of treatment acquire TKI resistance. Consequently, the median PFS for NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation is only 9.5 months. The reason for this acquired drug resistance is not yet fully understood. Recent studies have reported oncogenes such as AXL could be responsible for TKI resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of drug resistance is key in developing a solution to overcome the problem. For this study, we first examined the resistance mechanism and developed a biodegradable targeted nanoparticle based solution to systematically investigate the role of AXL in resistant NSCLC cell lines. In this study we (1) downregulated AXL using siRNA and separately (2) knocked out the AXL gene using crRNA (CRISPR) and treated with TKI. Our results show that AXL is responsible for activation of several EMT related proteins and upregulation of mTOR pathway. We believe the upregulation of these proteins is essential for cancer cells to switch pathways for proliferation and regulating miRNAs linked to mutations. Our results further confirm that AXL is responsible for regulating MMP-2 that is associated with cell invasion. Based on data from multiple cell lines such as H820 and A549, we demonstrate that AXL upregulation is responsible for resistance independent of EGFR activating mutations. The elucidated pathway for drug resistance was further confirmed in cell lines generated by knocking-out the AXL gene. Interpretation for AXL signaling and drug resensitization was confirmed by Western blotting, Zymography, Invasion & Migration assay, Apoptosis assay and MTT toxicity assay. We performed mRNA and miRNA analysis using qRT-PCR to understand gene expression post treatment. During the process of our investigation, we found that NSCLC cells undergo further survival cross talk with other biomarkers. Indeed, we report the first experimental evidence of a survival cross talk between AXL and FN14, a wound healing gene, that enhance cell survival post treatment. Down regulation of both AXL and FN14 dramatically reduced the IC50 of TKI. Based on the mechanism, we designed a gelatin nanoparticle that can carry both AXL and FN14 to deliver it in the tumor cell. The nanoparticle is targeted to tumor using EGFR-antibody and releases the silencing RNA within cytoplasm. We further demonstrated that dual-inhibition of AXL and FN14 in A549 mice xenografts showed tumor reduction compared to controls. In conclusion, inhibition of AXL and FN14 can maximize therapeutic response of TKI, wherein AXL is upregulated before or during drug treatment.']",

Although multiple mechanisms are involved in cisplatin efficacy, the most prominent and best understood modes of action are the generation of DNA lesions and induction of apoptosis and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent effects on mitochondrial integrity. However, intrinsic or acquired cisplatin resistance can become a limiting factor in cisplatin-based therapy. Evofosfamide is a hypoxia-activated prodrug that is reduced at its nitroimidazole group and preferentially under hypoxic conditions releases Br-IPM, a DNA cross-linker. Evofosfamide is currently being investigated in multiple clinical trials for the treatment of cancer including indications and settings where resistance to cisplatin is observed (e.g. second-line non-small cell lung cancer; NCT01403610). We have previously demonstrated both shared and distinct DNA repair pathways involved with evofosfamide and cisplatin DNA damage. In the current study, we have conducted comparative studies to identify any distinctions in the relative role of ROS underlying cell sensitivity to cisplatin and evofosfamide to help evaluate the potential of evofosfamide to treat cisplatin-resistant tumors. The cisplatin-sensitive cervical cancer cell line ME180, the intermediate cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cell line SK-OV-3, and cisplatin-resistant human lung cancer cell line A549 were investigated with respect to their chemosensitivity to evofosfamide. Unlike cisplatin, evofosfamide exhibited similar potency across all three cell lines. Addition of the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) reduced the potency of cisplatin- but not evofosfamide-mediated cytotoxicity, indicating ROS plays a role in cytotoxicity mediated by cisplatin, but not evofosfamide. ROS levels were investigated using the dye H2DCFDA. Cisplatin induced a concentration-dependent and NAC-inhibitable increase of cellular ROS in cisplatin-sensitive ME-180 cells but not in cisplatin-resistant A549 cells.

In order to ascertain whether mitochondrial pathway-mediated apoptosis was involved in cytotoxicity mediated by evofosfamide and cisplatin, mitochondrial membrane depolarization was investigated with the dye JC-1. Cisplatin induced a concentration-dependent JC-1 polarization and these effects were abolished by NAC. In contrast, evofosfamide did not affect mitochondrial membrane potential.

Most NSCLCs with target undergo at least some regression although the degree varies between patients due to largely unexplored factors. Many mechanisms of acquired resistance have been defined, including outgrowth of subclones with secondary mutations or alternative pathways, and pharmacological effects & sanctuaries. Available data suggest that resistant cells are present in small numbers in the initial tumor but that their growth is suppressed by the more rapidly growing parent tumor cells until this parent population is itself suppressed by TKI initiation. If TKI is stopped due to progression, there can be tumor flare as the initial parent cell population regrows rapidly. Exponential decay nonlinear regression analysis of patient survival curves suggests that TKI discontinuation at time of progression may partially synchronize patient deaths. Initial tumor progression may occur in a single site. Available data indicate that focal treatment (eg, radiation) to that site combined with continuation of initial TKI may give optimal control and reduce tumor flare. Of interest, progression may occur in many sites concurrently. Since there are many potential resistance mechanisms one might expect substantial discordance of resistance mechanisms between these sites, but preliminary data with 2nd line agents (eg, anti-T790M agents in EGFR-mutant patients and 2nd generation anti-ALK agents for acquired resistance to crizotinib) indicate response in most sites if any are sensitive, suggesting that all or most sites have a common resistance mechanism. This raises the possibility that an initial resistant site is seeding other distant tumor sites with resistant cells, in keeping with animal data.

The histology and expression of related markers were analyzed by H&E, IHC staining, quantitative PCR and western blot. Results', ' BAPN/DPA treatment could result in a dramatic reduction of collagen deposition.

Detailed pathological analyses showed that a few tumors from treatment group displayed typical squamous pathology, with the expression of squamous markers P63 and K14. In contrast, the tumors from control groups were adenomatous pathology and only expressing ADC markers TTF1 and SP-C. We further found that either BAPN or DPA treatment in KP mice promoted apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in ADC. Interestingly, we found the transited SCC showed almost no growth arrest and low apoptosis rate after BAPN or DPA treatment, indicative of the resistance to LOX inhibitors. ECM deprivation is a major cause of oxidative stress that contributes to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the deregulation of certain metabolic pathways. We then checked the level of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dGuo), a marker of DNA oxidative modification by ROS. In treatment groups, 8-oxo-dGuo was significantly lower in SCC than ADC. In our previous work done in KL model, we found that the ROS level was significantly up-regulated by LKB1 inactivation, which functionally modulated the AST.

Our microarray gene expression analysis suggested that it induces oxidative stress in lung adenocarcinoma H441 cells but not in normal lung fibroblasts. That oxidative stress is a triggering mechanism for both apoptotic and autophagic cell death has been supported by several recent reports. Compared to normal cells, the cancer cells are more vulnerable to oxidative stress-induced cell death because of their high metabolic activity, increased likelihood of electron escape during oxidative phosphorylation and overburdened antioxidant system. In this study, we tested our hypothesis that CLEFMA-induced apoptotic cell death was dependent on the accompanying increase in oxidative stress in H441cells. Methods', ' Inhibition of cell growth by CLEFMA (10 M) was estimated by MTT or hexosaminidase assay. ROS production, cell cycle and apoptotic cell population were assessed by flow cytometry. The phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), p38 and JNK1/2 were examined by Western blotting. N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 5 mM) and PD98059 (5 mM) were used as ROS scavenger and ERK1/2 inhibitors, respectively. The molecular markers of apoptosis were analyzed by RT-PCR and immunobloting. Results', ' NCI-DTP program confirmed anticancer activity of CLEFMA in 60 human cancer cell lines. CLEFMA-treated H441 cells showed typical molecular signatures of apoptosis- upregulated pro-apoptotic and downregulated anti-apoptotic genes. There was time-dependent activation of caspases 3/7, PARP cleavage and BAX; the expression of anti-apoptotic XIAP1 and BCL-xL was reduced, whereas pro-apoptotic p53 was increased. Since BID was not activated, it appears that CLEFMA works through intrinsic apoptosis pathway. CLEFMA also induced sustained activation of ERK, p38 and JNK. The pharmacologic inhibition of ERK, but not that of p38 and JNK, resulted in decreased anti-proliferative activity of CLEFMA. ERK inhibition with PD98059 abrogated CLEFMA-induced apoptosis. The sustained ERK activation was found to be associated with the inhibition of dual specificity phosphatase, DUSP6, expression. Treatment with ROS scavenger NAC abrogated CLEFMA-induced cell death, ERK activation and pro-apoptotic biomarkers, and reinstated DUSP6 expression. Conclusion', ' From the results of this study, we conclude that CLEFMA-induces apoptosis by enhancing oxidative stress in the cancer cells, and that the accompanying prolonged ERK activation is required for CLEFMA-induced H441 cell death.']",

        "Background":"['Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKi) have greatly improved the treatment and prognosis of multiple cancer types. However, unexpected cardiotoxicity has arisen that was not wholly predicted by current FDA mandated pre-clinical tests. Thus a more robust tool to predict the cardiotoxic potential of these compounds is warranted. For this purpose, we developed a panel of in vitro tests in a clinically relevant human cardiomyocyte model that assesses drug impact on overall cardiac health (cell viability, apoptosis, and morphology), mitochondria and metabolic intactness (reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, AMPK activity, and lipid accumulation), and electrophysiological function (impedance (beat rate) and ion channel blockage). To demonstrate the utility of our panel, we examined the effect of 4 FDA-approved TKi with known clinical outcome on cardiac health. The 3 drugs with known cardiac adverse events (crizotinib, sunitinib, and nilotinib) all proved to be cardiotoxic by our panel although each showed distinct mechanisms of toxicity. However erlotinib, a cardiac-safe drug that targets EGFR and is used primarily in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), did not show any indications of toxicity. Surprisingly, the most cardiotoxic drug by our panel was crizotinib, an ALK/ MET inhibitor that has revolutionized treatment for ALK+ NSCLC patients. Crizotinib potently impaired overall cardiac health by increasing ROS and apoptosis but also impeded electrophysiological function by inducing ion channel blockage and reducing cardiac beat rate. Interestingly crizotinib also induced lipid and cholesterol accumulation which was shown to be correlated with increased expression of the sterol-regulatory binding protein (SREBP) pathway by transcriptome analysis. The multi-targeted TKi sunitinib (used in renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors) and nilotinib (used in chronic myelogenous leukemia) also showed unique cardiotoxicity profiles. In conclusion, our studies showed a distinct cardiotoxicity profile for each TKi that correlates with clinical outcome. These results suggest that caution should be taken with these TKi especially when used long-term or in the adjuvant setting. Furthermore, these effects may be exacerbated in patients with adverse cardiac genetic predispositions and studies are ongoing in our lab on patient-derived cardiac cell lines to investigate this possibility. This multi-parameter screening approach allows for a more complete assessment of the potential for drug-induced cardiotoxicity and may allow for earlier detection in the drug development process. In addition, understanding the mechanisms of cardiac toxicities may lead to the discovery of novel mitigation strategies and combination therapies to improve cardiac cell health during treatment with oncology therapies.']",

        "Background":"['Arsenic is a well-known human carcinogen which is closely associated with lung cancer. However, the mechanism underlying the arsenic-induced carcinogenesis remains to be elucidated. The alterations of miRNAs profiles in cancers have profound implication in cancer development. However, it remains to be determined whether the alterations of miRNA signature in response to carcinogens such as arsenic may result in cell malignant transformation and tumor growth. In this study, we developed an in vitro model by transforming human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells through long-term exposure to low concentration of arsenic. The BEAS-2B cells were malignantly transformed validated by cell proliferation, anchorage independent growth and tumor growth assay. By utilizing this model, we found that miR-199a-5p expression level was dramatically repressed in arsenic-transformed cells. Re-expression of miR-199a-5p impaired arsenic-induced tumor angiogenesis through directly targeting hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). Interestingly, we found another proangiogenic factor cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) that was also upregulated in arsenic-transformed cells and was predicted as a target of miR-199a-5p. It was confirmed by generating COX-2 3UTR miRNA luciferase reporters with wild-type or mutant binding sites with miR-199a-5p. Overexpression of miR-199a-5p inhibited COX-2 protein expression. Functional study revealed that knockdown of COX-2 by siRNA in arsenic-transformed cells decreased tumor angiogenesis. We further showed that the COX-2 promoter contains a functional hypoxia response element (HRE). HIF-1 regulated COX-2 expression at the transcriptional level via direct binding to the HRE (-576/-584) located within the COX-2 promoter. Thus, arsenic-induced COX-2 activation is mediated by repression of miR-199a-5p and activation of HIF-1. Moreover, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a product of COX-2 regulated HIF-1 expression in a positive-feedback manner. In addition, arsenic-transformed cells have high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for activating COX-2 pathway. Taken together, our results demonstrate that arsenic-induced angiogenesis through miR-199a-5p repression and pro-inflammatory responses induced by ROS. Both pathways lead to activation of HIF-1/COX-2 pathway. These findings establish critical roles of miR-199a-5p and its downstream targets HIF-1/COX-2 in arsenic-induced tumor angiogenesis. As miR-199a-5p is generally downregulated, whereas COX-2 is overexpressed in human lung cancer tissues, they may be used as new therapeutic targets for lung cancer treatment in the future.']",

One of the most severe DNA lesions is the double-strand break (DSB). There are several repair systems to fix the resulting DNA lesions to prevent error copies of genetic information to be carried to daughter cells. Oxidative stress is an important factor to induce DNA damage during normal cellular metabolism. In this study, we wanted to use lung cancer cells, CL1-0 and CL1-5 cells, which have differential invasiveness ability to characterize DNA repair function. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was treated in lung adenocarcinoma cells to induced DNA DSB. By using immunoflurecence microscope, we found that CL1-5 had more gamma-H2AX foci (DNA DSB marker) and ROS accumulation than CL1-0 post both 1 mM and 5 mM H2O2 treatment. Moreover, CL1-0 had a tight G2/M checkpoint and has a longer G2 arrest after H2O2 treatment, but not found in CL1-5. In addition, increasing sub-G1 population (apoptotic cells) was found in H2O2-treated CL1-5 but less in CL1-0. Furthermore, phosphorylated-Akt (S473) was decreased in CL1-5, In contrast, phosphorylated-ATM (S1981) and Chk2 were increased after 5 mM H2O2 treatment for 90 min. In addition, the level of GSH was persistently lower at the steady state and post H2O2 treatment in CL1-5 by LC-MS/MS analysis. Besides, the apoptotic cells were decreased but no differences in CL1-0 while supplement reduced-GSH before H2O2 treatment. We therefore hypothesize that there are different processes on dealing with ROS scavenging post oxidative stress between CL1-0 and CL1-5. Taken together, using hydrogen peroxide for treating two lung cancer cell lines seem to have different DNA repair function to regulate cellular function. In the following experiments, the activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase as well as glutathione peroxidase (GPx) post oxidative stress in CL1-0 and CL1-5 will be determined.

Treatment of tumor cells in culture with low micromolar ME-344 decreased mitochondrial ATP production and increased ROS, with subsequent disruption of mitochondrial integrity. To gain further insight into this unusual mechanism of action, we compared ME-344 activity in sensitive and naturally resistant lung cancer cell lines, together with primary human lung embryonic fibroblasts (HLEF). Using SeaHorse technology we measured the impact of ME-344 on oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) in these cells under conditions of mitochondrial and glycolytic stress. In a dose dependent manner, the drug caused instantaneous and pronounced inhibition of OCR in drug-sensitive lung cancer cells; significantly less in drug-resistant cells. These results are consistent with targeting of mitochondria by ME-344 with specific effects to the respiratory chain (drug resistance correlated with higher glycolytic indexes in these cells.) Inhibition of OCR did not occur in primary HLEF. ME-344 increased ECAR in drug-resistant lung cancer cells, where this effect was significantly diminished in drug-sensitive cells. Such data suggest that ME-344 specifically targets mitochondrial proton channels (pumps). Only in drug sensitive cells, ME-344 dose-dependently increased the intracellular generation of ROS (detected by H2DCF-DA or Deep Red fluorescent dye staining assays) and caused oxidation of intracellular low molecular weight (mainly GSH) and protein thiols and of NAD(P)H. In vivo studies used the PyMT mouse model, which gives rise to spontaneous breast tumors that are highly glycolytic, useful in assessing the comparative roles of aerobic and glycolytic metabolism. In this model, chronic treatments with the small molecule anti-angiogenic agent BIBF1120 (nintedanib) significantly diminished glycolysis, with the consequence that the growing tumor shifted to reliance on mitochondrial metabolism as the primary energy source. As monotherapy, ME-344 caused minimal inhibition of primary tumors. However, tumors primed by treatment with BIBF1120 showed significantly enhanced sensitivity to ME344, with synergistic antitumor activity. These data indicate complex, but mitochondria-specific effects of ME-344 in cancer cells, differing in extent from normal and linked with drug sensitivity profile with clinical potential through its specific targeting of bioenergetics pathways in cancer cells with the potential for beneficial therapeutic index.']",

By comparing transcriptome profiles of CTCs from breast, prostate and lung cancers with their primary tumor of origin, we observed consistent and significant induction of the -globin gene (HBB) within CTCs. In contrast, expression of -globin, its binding partner within hematopoietic cells, is not coordinately upregulated. The tumor-specific origin of HBB was further confirmed by analysis of human xenografts-derived CTCs in mice, where human-specific HBB polymorphisms are readily distinguishable in the murine background. In cultured cancer cells, we further demonstrate that induction of HBB is triggered by exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS), and we identify KLF-family transcriptional regulators that mediate this effect. To investigate the function of aberrant -globin expression within CTCs, we performed shRNA-mediated knockdown of HBB in breast CTC-derived cultures. Cells with depleted HBB expression displayed elevated intracellular ROS levels, increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, and impaired metastatic potential in mouse models.

To study how the different mutant forms of IKK regulate KrasG12D-induced lung ADC development, we crossed KrasG12D mice with Ikk floxed mice and two Ikk knock-in mice and found that a lung specific IKK deletion (IkkLung) and two different IKK point mutants (IkkKA/KA', ' KA at amino acid 44 and IkkAA/AA', ' SA at amino acids 176 and 180) promote the progression of KrasG12D-induced lung ADCs. The IKK mutants integrate into the KrasG12D-mediated diverse oncogenic pathways; additionally the mutants increase levels of pulmonary macrophage infiltration, ROS, and DNA damage compared to KrasG12D-induced lung ADCs. IKK deficiency results in decreased levels of Nrf2, a transcription factor that regulates expression of genes encoding many anti-oxidants, and increased levels of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2), which form an oxidative stress-inflammation circuitry partially regulated by a new identified pathway of IKK, aryl hydrocarbon receptor and Nox2. Treatment with a Nox inhibitor (apocynin) or a ROS scavenger (N-acetyl cysteine), and/or Nox2 null bone marrow transplant inhibits the pathogenesis of ADCs. Also, we observed various aberrations of IKK in human lung ADCs. The study not only demonstrates that IKK serves as a gatekeeper to suppress oncogenic oxidative stress in lung ADC development, but also provides an advanced model that explains how the different mutant forms of a signal gene integrate into distinct signalings to enhance the crucial driver KrasG12D-induced lung cancer development.']",

        "Background":"['Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an anticancer therapy to induce tumor-specific cytotoxicity by accumulation of photosensitizers (PSs) and following non-toxic light irradiation to tumor tissues. Non-toxic light irradiation induces the PS-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent cytotoxicity in tumor cells. For clinical application, some kinds of PSs, such as photofrin and laserphyrin, are intravenously injected before light irradiation in anticancer PDT. However, the lack of sufficient and continuous accumulation of PSs in tumor tissues makes difficult to eradicate tumor cells by PDT. Therefore, the development of novel PSs that accumulate to tumor tissues more efficiently and persistently is required to improve the antitumor effect of PDT. Recently, a bioengineered fluorescent protein KillerRed has been reported to generate ROS upon green light irradiation, suggesting a potential of KillerRed fluorescent protein as a novel PS. In this study, we investigated the antitumor effect of KillerRed fluorescent protein in human cancer cells in combination with PDT. Transient transfection with KillerRed expression vector induced the photosensitive cytotoxicity upon green light irradiation within a few hours in human cancer HeLa and OST cells. To further evaluate the cytotoxic effect of KillerRed fluorescent protein in human cancer cells, we obtained the stable transfectants expressing cytotoxic KillerRed or non-cytotoxic Katushka fluorescent protein from human lung cancer H1299 cells. Green light irradiation induced the cytotoxic effect within one hour in H1299-KillerRed cells, but not in H1299-Katushka or H1299 cells. H1299-KillerRed cells irradiated with green light showed significantly higher levels of ROS, which was confirmed by intracellular fluorescence level of 2,7-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein Diacetate, than H1299-Katushka or H1299 cells. Immunocytochemistry further revealed that green light-irradiated H1299-KillerRed cells showed the apoptotic cell death with the cleavage of caspase-3 24 hours after irradiation. These results suggest that KillerRed fluorescent protein is a potent novel PS inducing ROS generation and apoptotic cell death in tumor cells in anticancer PDT. The development of virus-mediated delivery system for tumor-specific induction of KillerRed fluorescent protein is under way.']",

        "Background":"['Oncogenic RAS signaling-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) drive tumor progression by the hyperactivation of proliferative, anti-apoptotic, and metastatic pathways. Elevated ROS levels however can also cause oxidative DNA damage, leading to oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) and cell death. To avoid such tumor-suppressive outcomes, RAS-driven tumors often upregulate redox-protective proteins. The collective research from our group over the last few years has shown that oncogenic RAS elevates expression of the mammalian 8-oxo-dGTPase MutT Homolog 1 (MTH1), which in turn enables evasion of OIS, promotes transformation efficiency, and facilitates tumorigenicity. Our prior work has therefore demonstrated that MTH1 is beneficial to the spectrum of RAS-driven transformation, and that its shRNA-mediated targeting in oncogenic RAS-harboring lung cancer cells produces robust tumor-suppressive outcomes. However the first wave of chemical MTH1 inhibitors has led to controversial and conflicting results regarding MTH1 as a chemotherapeutic target. Here we evaluate the benefit of MTH1 inhibitors in wildtype. vs. oncogenic KRAS expressing cells, and directly assess the effects of oncogenic KRAS as well as three recently developed inhibitors on MTH1 8-oxo-dGTPase activity. Our results support that introduction of oncogenic KRAS elevates both MTH1 expression and activity, presumably through its elevation of ROS levels, and thus sensitizes cells to MTH1 inhibitors. The degree of this sensitization has a complex dependence on residual 8-oxodGTPase activity in the different cells following treatment with the MTH1 inhibitors, alternate antioxidant responses, and induction of different tumor suppressor pathways. Our data therefore highlight the importance of evaluating the molecular contexts and outcomes of MTH1 inhibition when determining its utility as a chemotherapeutic target.']",

        "Background":"['Cancer cells have been shown to be in a constant state of metabolic oxidative stress, concurrent with an elevated level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In order to facilitate survival in the face of increased steady-sate levels of ROS, cancer cells rely on glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (Trx) dependent metabolism. We have recently demonstrated that the simultaneous inhibition of GSH using Buthionine sulphoximine [(BSO), a GHS synthesis inhibitor] and thioredoxin reductase using auronofin [(Au), a thioredoxin reductase inhibitor] effectively chemo-radio-sensitized lung cancer cells via a mechanism involving oxidative stress. In this work we extend this observation to demonstrate that Au 2 mg/kg and BSO 450 mg/kg, given prior to ionizing radiation (6 Gy x 2 doses) can significantly delay tumor growth rate for mice treated with radiation alone in H292 lung cancer xenografts. In addition, we demonstrate through clonogenic survival assays that the combination of Au (250-500 nM) and BSO (100 M) radio-sensitizes two breast cancer cell lines in vitro, and more importantly the combination of Au and BSO given by intraperitoneal injection prior to radiation decreases the percent of breast cancer stem/progenitor cells in vivo. The rate limiting substrate for GSH synthesis is cysteine, whose level is controlled by the xc- cystine/glutamate antiporter. Sulfasazine (SSZ) has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the xc- cystine/glutamate antiporter. We demonstrate that SSZ (0.1-0.5 mM) decreases total GSH (up to 90%) levels in a dose dependent manner in both Mia PaCa-2 and PANC-1 human pancreatic cell lines. The combination of Au (250 nM for 3 hours) with SSZ (0.2 mM for 24 hours) demonstrates an 80% and 30% decrease in clonogenic cell survival in MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 pancreatic cells that is inhibited by treatment with the thiol antioxidant, 15 mM N-acetylcysteine. These results indicate that inhibition of hydroperoxide metabolism using pharmacologically relevant agents to simultaneously disrupt GSH and Trx system, can sensitize multiple cancer cell lines to radiation. These results support the hypothesis that standard of care radiotherapy protocols could be enhanced using SSZ, Au, and/or BSO.

        "Background":"['In recent years, epigenetic therapeutics is a new generation of chemotherapeutics for cancer. Microtubule-targeted agents constitute a type of anticancer drugs largely used in the clinics. Cells generate distinct microtubule subtypes through expression of different iso-types and through post-translational modifications, including acetylation, detyrosination, polyglutamination and polyglycylation. The acetylation of -tubulin K-40 is controlled by the balance between acetyltransferase and de-acetylase expression. MEC-17, one of -tubulin acetyltransferases, plays an important role in the regulation of acetylation of -tubulin. Through screening of compounds that is able to selectively acetylate -tubulin, MPT0B292 was identified.Our results show that MPT0B292 up-regulate MEC-17 gene and protein expression, which subsequently lead to enhancing -tubulin acetylation. MPT0B292 exhibits potent anti-proliferative activities toward various human cancer cells with IC50 ranged from 75 to 200 nM. In addition, HUVEC and WI-38 cells were much less susceptibility to the anti-proliferative effect of MPT0B292 with IC50 4 and12 M, respectively. In FACS analysis of cell cycle, MPT0B292 induces G2/M phase arrest with concomitantly losses from G0/G1 and S phases in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, MPT0B292 induces ROS generation in a concentration-dependent manner by FACS analysis, which leads to damaging mitochondria and triggering cell apoptosis. The effects MPT0B292-induced ROS and cell apoptosis could be significantly rescued by pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine, Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) and rotenone. Moreover, the amount of ROS induced by MPT0B292 was significantly reduced by knockdown of MEC-17 with siRNA and resulted in rescuing cell viability. In addition, MPT0B292 inhibits cell motility by an increase in cellular focal adhesion area. Moreover, MPT0B292 shows potent activity against the growth of xenograft tumor of lung cancer cell, A549, without significantly compromising the mice body weight. MPT0B292 also decreases lung metastasis in orthotopical breast cancer model.

Outcome of oncogene-targeted pharmacotherapies (cell cycle inhibition, apoptosis, senescence, autophagy) depends on variable factors (e.g. compound, dose, duration, cellular genetic background etc.). Oncogene-induced senescence is recognized as an important tumor-suppressive mechanism, bypassing of which may contribute to malignant transformation of the cells. On the other hand, senescence induction, in addition to apoptosis stimulation and proliferation suppression, is responsible for the cytostatic activity of many commonly used anticancer drugs. Therefore, senescence escape must be considered as an important drug-resistance factor.In our work we characterize,,DNA Damage-independent senescence induced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and growth factor deprivation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and other EGFR-dependent cells.Treatment of different cell lines with various concentrations of EGFR-TKIs was followed by the assessment of cell fate (i.e. apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, senescence and clonogenic survival) as well as intracellular signaling. We could show that treatment of EGFR-dependent cells with specific EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) can lead to generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activation of a DNA damage response (DDR) program and cellular senescence. Surprisingly, under certain experimental conditions DDR activation was found to be independent from detectable DNA damage. Key players of DDR signaling were shown to be essential for senescence induction.Molecular dissection of crucial signaling nodes and molecular switches involved in modulation of cell fate in oncogene dependent cells treated with specific EGFR-inhibitors is currently being performed. Furthermore, our work is focussed on the identification and characterization of cellular factors activating DNA damage response (DDR) pathways in the absence of DNA damage under certain experimental conditions.Understanding the interplay between theses decision making pathways either leading to proliferative arrest, cellular senescence or apoptosis will help improve current pharmacotherapies and develop new therapeutic approaches.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

        "Background":"['ADP- dependent glucokinase (ADPGK) is a glycolytic enzyme catalyzing the reaction of glucoseglucose 6-P by using ADP instead of ATP. ADPGK is remarkably conserved across various phyla from archaea to humans. Despite an important role priming glycolysis in conditions of metabolic stress in extremophile organisms, human ADPGK does not contribute to glycolysis. Recent work shows that ADPGK is essential for ROS generation during T-cell activation. Intriguingly, ADPGK protein levels are upregulated across a panel of cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Hereby we hypothesized that the increase of cellular ROS in response to mild (1% O2) hypoxia is dependent on ADPGK therefore contributing to the stabilization of hypoxia- inducible factor (HIF)-1, a central regulator of the transcriptional response of cancer cells to hypoxia.We achieved ADPGK loss-of-function (LOF) utilizing lentiviral shRNA- mediated knockdown (>75%) in HCT-116 and HT-29 (colon); or H460 (lung) cancer cell lines. Intracellular ROS levels under hypoxia (1% O2) were analyzed by CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence and flow cytometry. Protein levels of HIF-1 (and -2), and selected HIF- targets were assessed by immunoblot assays. HIF-1 (and -2) transcriptional activity was measured through a RT-qPCR array developed in house targeting 84 hypoxia- responsive transcripts in HCT-116 cells exposed to 20, 10, 5, 1, .2 and <.02% O2 for 24 h. Baseline non-hypoxic oxygen consumption and glycolytic activities were measured in real-time with an automated bioanalyzer (Seahorse Biosciences) whereas 3D spheroid growth assays and HCT-116 xenografts were used to assess the effect of ADPGK LOF on tumor mass.ADPGK LOF decreased ROS and HIF-1 (-and 2) protein levels in a cell type- and O2- dependent manner in HCT-116, HT-29 and H460 cells. Results from our RT-qPCR array show a blunted transcriptional response to hypoxia with maximal inhibition at .2% O2 (15 mmHg). Immunoblots confirmed a striking impairment of CA9 hypoxic induction in addition to a significant decrease of the HIF- targets IGFBP3, ERO-1 and DDIT4. 3D spheroid assays showed a significant growth rate increase after ADPGK knockdown. Addition of the antioxidant N-Ac-Cysteine during the spheroid formation phase mimicked the effect of ADPGK LOF in control cells whereas it further enhanced cell growth in ADPGK knockdown. However, baseline O2 consumption and glycolysis were not affected. Consistently with results of 3D spheroid assays, we observed enhanced tumor growth of HCT-116 xenografts bearing ADPGK LOF.Our work uncovers a hitherto unknown function of ADPGK in cancer cells whereby it enhances ROS- dependent HIF-1 (and -2) hypoxic stabilization and transactivation therefore limiting tumor growth. Further work will be focused on the mitochondrial origin of ADPGK- dependent hypoxic ROS generation as suggested by previous studies in primary T-lymphocytes.']",

In lung adenocarcinoma in particular, a quarter of tumors have inactivating mutations in the SWI/SNF components Smarca4, ARID1A or the histone modifier SETD2. With the aim of understanding the mechanism of tumor development and identifying potential vulnerabilities of SWI/SNF mutant tumor, we developed a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of lung adenocarcinoma by selectively ablating Smarca4 in the respiratory epithelium. We demonstrate that Smarca4 acts as a bona fide tumor suppressor and cooperates with p53 loss. Cross species integrative gene expression analyses revealed signatures of enhanced oxidative phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) response in Smarca4 mutant murine and human lung tumors. We further show that Smarca4 mutant cells have increased oxygen consumption, enhanced basal and maximal respiratory capacity and production of ROS. This is primarily driven by activation of the mitochondrial master regulator, PGC1alpha. Finally, we show that Smarca4 and other SWI/SNF mutant lung cancer cell lines have exquisite sensitivity to inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation using a novel small molecule that is under development.

We have developed a nanoscale micelle formulation for JS-K (P123/JS-K) using Pluronic P123 polymers to stabilize and solubilize the drug. In the present study, the mechanism of action of JS-K was investigated. We speculated that, being a NO-releasing drug, JS-K causes nitrosative/oxidative stress. We therefore hypothesized that JS-K causes multiple stress responses that ultimately trigger apoptosis in the cell. We also hypothesized that JS-K affects the intrinsic component (defined as cell cycle, survival and stress pathways in the cell) of leukemic cells.In this work, using human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells, we studied the effect of JS-K on two major cellular stresses, namely ER stress and nitrosative/oxidative stress. On treating HL-60 cells with 5M JS-K formulated in DMSO (JS-K) or P123/JS-K for 4-8 hours, activation of both GRP-78 and CHOP (markers of ER stress) was observed using western blot analysis. ER stress could also be triggered by phosphorylation of JNK protein. Again, using western blot analysis, JNK phosphorylation was observed when HL60 cells were treated with JS-K or P123/JS-K for 4-6 hours. Oxidative stress was studied by quantifying intracellular levels of reactive oxygen/reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) using the ROS/RNS sensitive fluorophore 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2-7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 5M of JS-K or P123/JS-K for 30, 60 or 120 minutes lead to increased levels of ROS/RNS.These experiments show that JS-K activates the intrinsic component of cell death by producing ER stress and oxidative stress. JS-K is at an advanced stage of pre-clinical development. Its novel and multiple mechanisms of action make it an attractive therapy for the treatment of AML and other malignancies.']",

        "Background":"['Patients with pancreatic cancers have one of the highest mortality rates of any cancer with 5-year survival rates of 6%. The therapeutic responses of pancreatic cancers are highly variable and there is a desperate need for agents to specifically and efficaciously treat pancreatic cancer patients. We recently discovered that not only were NAD(P)H', \"quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) levels elevated 5- to 40-fold in >90% of pancreatic tumors vs associated normal tissue, but that catalase levels were inversely expressed comparatively, elevated in normal vs tumor tissue. NQO1 represents a unique target to exploit for the therapeutic elimination of pancreatic cancers. NQO1 bioactivatable drugs, such as -lapachone (-lap) or deoxynyboquinone (DNQ) and derivatives generate hydrogen peroxide as a mechanism to hyperactivate PARP1 and selectively kill tumors. In addition to catalase, reduced glutathione levels are essential for a cell's protection against hydrogen peroxide. Tumors with mutated KRAS, which constitutes >90% of pancreatic cancers, are metabolically reprogrammed to rely on glutamine to maintain the cell's NADPH and glutathione levels, and therefore, anti-oxidant state (Son et.al., Nature, 2013). The present study evaluated the therapeutic potential of inhibiting this KRAS-reprogrammed metabolic pathway with the small molecule GLS1 inhibitor, BPTES, in combination with NQO1-bioactivatable drugs, -lapachone or IB-DNQ. Synergistic cell lethality was noted using non-lethal doses of BPTES combined with sublethal doses of -lapachone in KRAS-driven pancreatic or non-small cell lung cancer cells. ROS levels in BPTES and -lap treated cell lines were dramatically higher than the ROS levels with either agent alone. This was further supported by a dramatic loss of glutathione and NADPH following combination treatment vs either agent alone. Lethality was completely rescued by the addition of the NQO1 inhibitor, dicoumarol, demonstrating that synergy is dependent on the NQO1 activation of -lap. Partial rescue was seen with the addition of cell permeable glutathione further demonstrating the importance of ROS in synergy. The addition of cell permeable malate and oxaloacetate, downstream metabolites of the KRAS-driven glutamine pathway, also rescued synergy. Our findings indicate that NQO1-bioactivatable drugs may improve the sensitivities of clinical grade GLS1 inhibitors in pancreatic cancer patients.\"]",

We determined the ability of phenyl-2-aminoethyl selenide (PAESe), a novel antioxidant, to reduce doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity. Growth inhibitory effects of PAESe on human breast carcinoma (BT-474) and prostate adenocarcinoma (PC-3) cells were determined alone and in combination with two clinically used anticancer agents, DOX, a topoisomerase-2 antagonist known to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), and vincristine (a tubulin binding agent) and a known oxidant, tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBHP). Conventional growth inhibitory assays, i.e., sulforhodamine B (SRB) and 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium-bromide (MTT) staining, were used to determine in vitro activity. Treatment effect on intracellular formation of ROS was also determined by quantifying the oxidation of a cell-permeant indicator H2DCFDA. The effect of PAESe on cardiomyocytes was determined in NCr (nu/nu) mice with DOX (5 mg/kg), PAESe (10 mg/kg), concomitant (DOX & PAESe) therapy, and saline controls were administered by tail vein injections weekly over 12 weeks. Histopathological examination was performed to look for evidence of cardiotoxicity. PAESe did not alter the growth of BT-474 or PC-3 cells up to 10 uM. However, co-administration of PAESe decreased the oxidative-mediated cytotoxicity of TBHP in a dose-dependent manner, but had limited to no effect on vincristine or DOX antitumor activity. Further, PAESe decreased the formation of intracellular ROS from TBHP and DOX in a dose-dependent manner. Histological examination showed PAESe decreased short-term DOX-mediated infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the myocardium and more chronic evidence of necrotic foci, suggesting PAESe decreased early and late myocardial damage following initial and prolonged DOX treatments, unlike other antioxidants. Concomitant administration of PAESe did not alter the antitumor activity of DOX in vivo, nor did it reduce treatment mediated weight-loss associated with DOX.

GTN has been shown to be cytotoxic and induce apoptosis in many cancer cell lines. This study sought to define the molecular basis underlying the antiproliferative actions of GTN. We synthesized the R and S enantiomers of GTN and found the R form to be more cytotoxic against a panel of breast cancer and lung cancer cell lines. The IC50 of GTN against breast cancer cell lines was in the range of 10-20 M and interestingly, the SKBR3 cells, which harbor a R175H mutation in p53 were more sensitive to the drug. In contrast, the normal breast epithelial MCF10A cells were not killed by GTN, and N-acetylcysteine prevented cell-killing, indicating the ROS involvement. Indeed, the flow cytometry and cell staining with DCF-DA showed high levels of ROS generation, and this was accompanied by significant S-glutathionylation of bulk proteins. Other studies showed that GTN forms conjugate with glutathione with ease and deplete GSH levels in cells. Because p53 is a redox-sensitive protein, we hypothesized that the redox imbalance induced by GTN may affect the structure of the R175H mutant p53 protein, and account for greater cytotoxicity. We also engineered the p53-null H1299 lung cancer cells to stably express the R175H mutant protein by lentiviral technology as an isogenic model. The conformation-specific antibodies for p53, namely Pab1620 that recognize the wt-p53 and pab420 that detects the mutant p53 were used for validating the p53 restoration. Immunoprecipitation and immunostaining using confocal microscopy showed that GTN treatment of R175H p53-containing cells results in a reciprocal loss of mutant protein and increase of wt-like protein. Further, the EMSA revealed a time-dependent restoration of DNA-binding for the mutant p53, which was accompanied by the induction of p53 target genes. The changes were associated with a G2/M arrest and significant apoptosis. Increased levels of apoptotic markers suggested a priming action of GTN on cell death pathways. GTN also suppressed the SKBR3 cell migration and invasion at 5-10 M. In SKBR3 xenografts developed in nude mice, there was a marked tumor growth delay with either GTN alone or in combination with cisplatin. Our results shed light on the multiple mechanisms, including glutathione depletion, generation of redox imbalance, protein glutathionylation and p53 reactivation in the GTN cytotoxicity. We suggest that GTN-induced oxidative milieu facilitates a functional restoration of the mutant p53 through a thiolation of the redox-sensitive cysteines present in the DNA-binding domain.

        "Background":"['The development of radiation induced lung injury (RiPI) is a major barrier that limits the dose that can be administered for controlling locally advanced lung cancer. Although progress has been made toward identifying the pathophysiological events responsible for RiPI, there is still a substantial gap in knowledge. It is well established that oxidative stress is central to the progression of RiPR. In addition, reoccurring cellular injury appears to be a critical event for promotion of radiation-induced fibrosis. Yet, the exact mechanism by which reactive oxygen species (ROS) promotes injury and the nature of the reoccurring injury remain to be fully elucidated. Isolevuglandins are generated by free radical peroxidation of phospholipid-esterified arachidonic acid. Isoketalation, defined as covalent adduction of isolevuglandins to the -amino group of protein lysine residues, is emerging as a novel mechanism by which ROS contributes to the genesis of some diseases. Although isoketalation promotes proteotoxicity and cytotoxicity that can contribute to disease progression, there is currently a lack of knowledge concerning its role in RiPI, the identity of susceptible proteins or whether the process can be genetically regulated. We used a multifaceted approach that included wild type, Nrf2 and p47 null mice, confocal microscopy, and LC-MS/MS analysis of affinity purified proteins to address these questions. Mass spectrometry and gene ontology analysis identified several potential protein targets involved in cytoskeletal regulation, Wnt signaling, integrin signaling, chemokine and cytokine signaling and histone biology. Genetic evidence linking oxidant challenge to protein adduction was provided from the mouse knockout studies where it was shown that Nrf2 expression suppressed, while NADPH oxidase activity promoted isoketalation. We found that when isoketalation exceeded a critical level, cells underwent apoptosis. We identified the cell types in mouse lung that are susceptible to adduction. In a C57BL/6j murine model of radiation induced pulmonary injury we found that ionizing radiation increased the level of adduction concomitant with the development of a chronic apoptotic phenotype. We used human idiopathic pulmonary fibrotic (IPF) tissue as a surrogate for radiation-induced pulmonary fibrotic tissue, which is very hard to obtain. Human IPF and radiation-induced lung injury share a common phenotype that includes slow/chronic development and a prominent ROS component. We found an abundance of adducted protein in human IPF compared to control lung tissue, identified collagen 11 as one of the highly adducted proteins and show that adduction impairs collagen degradation by MMP1. In summary, these data support the hypothesis that radiation-induced oxidant stress promotes pulmonary injury, in part, by a hitherto, unrecognized mechanism', ' isoketalation.

Clinical trials involving HCQ in cancer patients are underway, but predictive biomarkers to identify patients most likely to respond are unavailable. To identify determinants of sensitivity to HCQ, an mRNA microarray analysis of HCQ-sensitive(S) compared to HCQ- resistant (R) colon and lung cancer cell lines identified differentially expressed genes in HCQ-S cells. Immunoblotting against the 2 most upregulated (Lysozyme (LYZ); aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1A1)) and 2 most down regulated proteins (helicase like transcription factor (HLTF); p-glycoprotein (ABCB1)) was performed in 35 human cancer cell lines. The IC50 and slope of the HCQ dose response curve (72 h MTT) were used to create a composite score to categorize cell lines as -S or -R, and correlated to protein expression of the 4 genes. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis determined that high expression of the stem cell marker ALDH1A1 or low expression of both ALDH1A1 and HLTF identified 100% of sensitive cell lines. To understand how ALDH1A1 mechanistically interacts with HCQ, the aldefluor assay determined that a more potent dimeric CQ (Lys21) did not impair ALDH1A1 enzymatic function, however knockdown or chemical inhibition of ALDH1A1 impaired cellular uptake of fluorescently tagged Lys21 and conferred resistance to HCQ. Overexpression of ALDH1A1 conferred HCQ sensitivity in HCQ-R cells. To understand the interaction between HLTF and HCQ, we determined that HLTF promoter methylation correlated with silenced expression and sensitivity to HCQ. Forced expression of HLTF or treatment with a demethylating agent conferred resistance to HCQ-S cells. Knockdown of HLTF in HCQ-R cells conferred sensitivity. HCQ produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) irrespective of HLTF status. Cotreatment with a ROS scavenger mitigated HCQ cytotoxicity in HLTF silenced cells. DNA damage (p-H2AX) was observed at 100-fold lower HCQ concentrations in HLTF silenced compared to HLTF expressed cells. Overexpression of HLTF significantly reduced HCQ associated double strand breaks (Rad52 foci). Knockdown of DNA polymerase eta, a low fidelity DNA polymerase involved in translesion synthesis (TLS) completely abrogated HLTF-associated HCQ resistance. In vivo expression of HLTF mitigated the antitumor activity of the dimeric CQ Lys05 in a HCQ-S colon cancer xenograft. These results indicate ALDH1A1 acts as a sink for CQ derivatives to enter the cell, localize to the lysosome, and produce ROS-mediated DNA damage. The DNA damage can be counteracted by intact HLTF/Pol eta-dependent TLS. Analysis of the TCGA found that the ALDH1A1 high and HLTF low phenotype is prevalent across 10 human cancers. In conclusion this study identifies a 2 gene signature that can be translated into an IHC-based assay to identify patients most likely to respond to lysosomal autophagy inhibitors.']",

In our lab, we focus on role of gain-of-function mutant SHP-2 (genetic factor) and heavy mental contamination or alcohol drinking (environmental factors) on tumor progression. Here, we reported environmental factors like heavy mental arsenic and alcohol consumption promote digestive tumor and breast cancer malignant behaviors. The first, clinic data showed that an increasing arsenic concentration in III/IV TNM stage gastric cancer patient, then an enhanced cancer cell malignant behaviors (proliferation/ motility/ metastasis, etc) were found in gastric cancer or colon cancer cell lines chronic treated with 5-15 nm arsenic in vitro and in vivo.

In vitro and in vivo experiments further indicated that alcohol promoted the progression and migration/invasion of HCC, breast cancer and lewis lung carcinoma (LLC). Specifically, we found that alcohol enhanced the migration/invasion of tumor cells and increased tumor angiogenesis. Consistently, higher expression of VEGF, MCP-1, activated NF-B and more infiltrated M2 macrophage was observed in tumor tissues of alcohol-drinkers. Alcohol induced the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activation of NF-B signaling in HepG2 cells. Conversely, blockage of alcohol-mediated ROS accumulation and NF-B signaling inhibited alcohol-induced expression of VEGF and MCP-1, the tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. These results suggested that chronic moderate alcohol consumption may promote the progression and metastasis of tumor; the oncogenic effect may be at least partially mediated by the ROS accumulation and NF-B-dependent VEGF and MCP-1 up-regulation.

Cancer prevention using natural products has become an integral part of cancer control. Quercetin is one of the most abundant dietary flavonoids widely present in many fruits and vegetables, possesses potent antioxidant activity capable of protecting normal cells from various stimuli-induced oxidative stress and cell death. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a key regulator of oncogenic processes. It is significantly elevated in the majority of human tumors and functionally linked to cellular proliferation, invasion and migration. Studies have shown that miR-21 exerts its oncogenic activity by targeting the tumor suppressor gene programmed cell death 4 (Pdcd4). The present study examined the effect of quercetin on the inhibition of Cr(VI) induced carcinogenesis and the role of miR-21-Pdcd4 signaling involved. Our results showed that quercetin decreased ROS generation induced by Cr(VI) exposure in Beas-2B cells. Chronic Cr(VI) exposure induced malignant cell transformation, increased miR-21 expression and caused inhibition of Pdcd4, which were significantly inhibited by the treatment of quercetin in a dose dependent manner. Stable knockdown of miR-21 or overexpression of pdcd4 in Beas-2B cells significantly reduced the Cr(VI) induced cell transformation. Furthermore, Quercetin also inhibited the Cr(VI) induced beta-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription.

We sought to determine whether NSCLC tumor cells with loss of LKB1 are preferentially sensitive or resistant to various therapeutic agents. We tested 23 NSCLC cell lines, and observed that LKB1 mutant NSCLC cells are highly resistant to standard chemotherapy as well as EGFR inhibitors. In contrast, LKB1 mutant NSCLC cells are highly sensitive to 8-Chloroadenosine (8-Cl-Ado). 8-Cl-Ado is an RNA-directed nucleoside analogue, which depletes cellular ATP and triggers apoptosis in sensitive cells. LKB1 is known to play a key role in balancing cellular energy consumption and production. Therefore, we hypothesize that LKB1 mutant NSCLC cells are vulnerable to 8-Cl-Ado induced energetic stress.

        "Background":"['Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. We previously demonstrated that IKK kinase dead knock-in (IkkK44A/K44A, KA) mice spontaneously develop lung SCCs, which is associated with IKK reduction and increased inflammation. Currently, lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) has surpassed SCC. Although downregulation of IKK has been reported in lung ADCs, the role of IKK is not clarified yet. Here, we attempted to verify whether IKK inactivation plays a role in development of lung adenocarcinomas (ADCs). K-rasG12D (Kras) mice are a well-established lung ADC model. Thus, we generated K-rasG12D;IkkK44A/K44A (Kras;KA) and K-rasG12D;Ikkf/f (Kras;FF) mice and activated oncogenic K-rasG12D with intratracheal injection of adenovirus carrying the cre recombinase gene in these mice. At 44.5 months after treatment, both Kras;KA and Kras;FF mice showed enhanced bronchial hyperproliferation and increased number of lung tumors than Kras mice. The histology showed that lung tumors from both mice can be classified into ADCs, while no SCCs were found in Kras;KA and Kras;FF mice. Finally, Kras;FF mice had shorter life span due to labored breathing than Kras mice. Thus, IKK plays an important role in lung ADCs as well as SCCs. It is well known that the oncogene activation such as Kras can induce a senescence program to suppress the progression of benign tumors. We found that IKK loss diminished Kras-induced senescence, given the results from senescence-associated -gal assay and Ki67 staining. We previously reported that inflammation is required for development of lung SCCs in KA mice. Macrophages were significantly accumulated in the lung of Kras;FF mice as well. In general, inflammation can cause oxidative stress. In line with this notion, the microarray analysis revealed that several antioxidant genes were markedly downregulated, while expression of some reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating genes was increased in the lung tissues from Kras;FF mice compared to Kras mice. In consistent, IKK depletion was correlated with increased level of ROS in lung tumors, which resulted in further oxidative DNA damage. Interestingly, tumors from Kras mice also showed IKK reduction compared to WT lungs. Taken together, these findings suggest that IKK reduction can promote Kras-driven lung tumorigenesis through its interplay between inflammation and oxidative stress. Inflammation and oxidative stress can sustain and exacerbate each other, leading to a vicious cycle of tumor-prone microenvironment. It is evident that IKK plays a crucial role in inflammation from massive investigations. The role of IKK in oxidative stress, however, is not clarified yet. Thus, our investigation of the role of IKK on lung ADC development in the context of modulating oxidative stress will provide better strategies to break the vicious cycle between inflammation, oxidative stress and lung tumorigenesis and noble therapeutic targets for treatment.']",

Eighteen out of the fifty-nine cell lines tested showed a GI50 below 2.5 M. In cell lines with altered p53 status, RA1 exhibited a potent effect (GI50 for NCI-H522, HOP-92, and HL-60', ' 1.2 M, 1.4 M, and 2.2 M, respectively).

No increase in p53 protein expression was observed upon treatment with RA1. Unlike conventional chemotherapy drugs, overexpression of the Bcl-2 protein to prevent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) had no effect on RA1's ability to induce cell death. The LC50 of GFP control and Bcl-2 overexpressing cells with RA1 is 7.7 and 7.4 M, respectively, compared to the control (etoposide\", ' LC50 0.6 M and >4 M). No change in cell cycle distribution was observed. No activation of the executioner caspases was seen by Western Blot; however, pretreatment with a caspase-2 inhibitor (z-VDVAD-FMK) prevented cell death. Electron microscopy images showed no morphological features characteristic of apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagy. Ferroptosis, an iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS) dependent form of cell death also lacks these morphological characteristics. While no organic peroxides are known to induce ferroptosis, the use of an iron chelator and Ferrostatin (a lipophillic anti-oxidant known to inhibit ferroptosis) inhibited cell death induced by RA1. Similar to some ferroptosis inducing compounds, a water soluble anti-oxidant had no effect on cell death; however, use of a ROS detection kit indicated oxidative stress is occurring.RA1 demonstrates potential therapeutic activity for the treatment of cancer. It is capable of overcoming two common chemo-resistance pathways', ' p53 mutation and inhibition of MOMP by modulation of the Bcl-2 family of proteins.

Clinical trials are recruiting or ongoing at additional tumor sites including lung, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer. The primary mechanism of TTField cell killing is thought to be the disruption of mitosis; however, other potential mechanisms are under investigation. Using a panel of five NSCLC cell lines we found that TTFields treatment alone inhibits cell proliferation, and decreases survival, though the degree of inhibition varies between cell lines. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological effects of TTField exposure we studied temporal gene expression changes in the NSCLC cell lines after TTField treatment. We observed that most differentially expressed genes are part of cell cycle and proliferation pathways which is in agreement with earlier findings. Interestingly we found that the expression of BRCA1 DNA damage repair pathway genes were significantly downregulated (P < 0.05) upon TTField treatment. We confirmed the downregulation of BRCA1/FA pathway proteins by western blot. When examining the nuclear role of the BRCA1/FA pathway genes we found that TTField treatment slowed the repair of ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage compared to radiation alone which is evident by an increased number of DNA double strand break repair foci at any given time. Moreover, we found that TTField treatment increased the incidence of chromatid aberrations. We also examined the newly identified BRCA1/FA pathway genes cytosolic role in mitophagy where we observed alterations in mitophagy related gene (PINK1, OSCP1, ATP5 and DAPIT) expression and confirmed the same at the protein level by western blot. We hypothesized that TTFields disrupt the clearance of damaged mitochondria due to the downregulation of BRCA1/FA pathway players, causing an imbalance in oxygen metabolism leading to the production of high levels of radical oxygen species (ROS) and as a result, cell death. Using CellROX dye we found that TTField treatment did result in increased ROS production suggesting a new mechanism of action for TTField exposure.

These results are in line with our data showing that in PC9 lung cancer cells stably expressing cytochrome c-GFP (used for mitochondrial cytochrome c release) NOSH-aspirin caused partial release of cytochrome c up to 3 hours when followed in real -time by fluorescence microscopy and image analysis. NOSH-ASA increased intracellular H2O2 and superoxide anions. Pretreatment of cells with N-acetylcysteine, blocked these. Xenografts\", ' NOSH-aspirin had no effect on the weight of the mice and there were no overt signs of toxicity. Tumor volume was reduced as a function of treatment time. The growth rate of ER(-) xenografts was significantly greater than that of ER(+) ones and NOSH-aspirin had a greater effect on the ER(-) vs ER(+) xenografts. Tumor mass for each group were, ER(+)', ' 0.460.056g untreated and 0.210.035g treated, (55% reduction, P=0.022), ER(-)', ' 1.20.33g untreated and 0.110.058g treated (91% reduction, P=0.006). NOSH-aspirin inhibited growth of these cancer cell xenografts as a result of reduced proliferation (decreased PCNA expression), and induction apoptosis (increased number of TUNEL positive cells), and induction of ROS.

        "Background":"['PKC is activated by ionizing radiation in a reactive nitrogen species dependent manner in tumor endothelial cells.Ionizing radiation (IR) has been shown to increase angiogenic markers and migration in endothelial cells involving reactive oxygen/nitrogen species and eNOS, but the exact mechanism is poorly understood. This activation of endothelial cells can increase angiogenesis post radiation and confer cytoprotection to tumor cells. Thus targeting this IR induced activation of endothelial cells should increase therapeutic efficacy of radiation therapy. Protein Kinase C Epsilon is a molecule that has been shown to be important in cancer cell motility, proliferation, hormone sensitivity and angiogenesis. PKC activates downstream pathways involved in tumorigenicity such as Akt and Stat3. PKC has also been shown to be nitrated in response to NO donors and inflammatory conditions in cardiac myocytes. During inflammation, hypoxia and irradiation, levels of reactive nitrogen species are elevated due to uncoupling of Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS). NOS can be recoupled with tetrahydrobiopterin precursor (sepiapterin) which decreases RNS/ROS in cells. We have shown in 2H11 cells (mouse tumor endothelial cells) that PKC levels are increased due to exposure to clinically relevant doses of ionizing radiation or levels of NO found in chronic inflammatory conditions. Also in these cells PKC is nitrated in response to reactive nitrogen species which leads to its activation and activation of Stat3 and Akt. Using sepiapterin, we have shown decreased levels of PKC, Stat3 and Akt. We have also blocked ionizing radiation induced migration in vitro in 2H11 cells using sepiapterin and a PKC inhibitor. We hope to show that PKC is nitrated at specific residue(s) after ionizing radiation and activates tumor endothelial cells to promote the survival of the tumor. We believe sepiapterin with ionizing radiation therapy will result in increase cytotoxicity in a spontaneous mouse model of lung cancer, by decreasing endothelial activation, migration, proliferation and angiogenesis.Citation Format', ' Asim Alam, Chris Rabender, Ross Mikkelsen.

        "Background":"['Cancer drug pan-resistance is associated with patients having a disease progression despite receiving new treatments. Often resistance arises in two steps, initially, the tumor responds to the drug, but not all tumor cells are killed leading to a selection of tumor cells that do not respond to any current drug. The nature of the residual disease is linked to different conditions such the efflux pumps, the quiescent cells, the stem cells, the DNA repair deficiency or the EMT. Here, we have identified a family of synthetic compounds displaying a preferential antiproliferative activity on drug resistant human cancer cells. The lead compound XCE853 is 5 to 94 more potent on drug resistant cancer cell lines compared to their parental tumor cell lines (HL60/HL60-Doxorubicin; MCF7/MCF7-Doxorubicin; A2780/A2780-Cisplatin and A549/AA549-Taxotere). XCE853 induced a strong and irreversible cytolysis of MCF7-Adriamycin cells after a short exposure in vitro (250nM, 6 hours). The mechanism of action of XCE853 is independent of efflux pumps and involves an early high ROS production leading to cell death by autophagy. The antitumor activity of XCE853 is also observed using in vivo xenograft models of human NSCLC. Altogether, these data support further efforts on this drug candidate to better understand its molecular mechanism of action and the description of the most sensitive tumor types.']",

        "Background":"['Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals often co-exist in the environment, but despite their significant toxicities little is known about their combined effects. Cadmium (Cd), a known human carcinogen, interferes with cellular responses to DNA damage, through inhibition of DNA repair systems, disturbance of tumor suppressor functions, or increased resistance to apoptosis. Cd has been linked to lung cancer in humans and the most common exposure scenarios in humans involve co-exposure with PAHs. However, studies on combined effects of Cd and PAHs are mostly limited to marine invertebrates or soil bacteria. Both PAHs and Cd induce formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell. Mitochondria are the main target for oxidative DNA damage and also play an important role in programmed cell death. Cytochrome c is an important component of apoptosis and its translocation from mitochondria to the cytosol is an indicator of apoptotic activity in intact cells. Another indicator of the early response to apoptotic signals is the phosphorylation of H2AX, which also reflects DNA damage. Here, we propose that the exposure of primary human bronchoepithelial cells (hBEC) to the mixture of benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-dione (BaPD) and cadmium chloride (CdCl2) will significantly augment DNA damage and disrupt mitochondrial functions involving apoptosis. Methods', ' Cytotoxicity was analyzed by the WST-8 assay. hBEC were exposed to CdCl2 (5 g/ml) and BaPD (10 g/ml) for 24h. Levels of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and cytochrome c were quantified using ELISA. Quantification of H2AX phosphorylation (Ser139, -H2AX) was performed by western blotting. Statistical tests were conducted using GraphPad Prism software at a significance level of 0.05. Mean levels across treatment groups were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results', ' IC50 values at 24h for CdCl2 and BaPD were 8.7 and 12.5 g/ml, respectively. Levels of 8-OHdG in nuclear DNA were significantly higher in hBEC exposed to CdCl2 or BaPD when compared to controls. We observed an increased release of cytochrome c during the first few hours after exposure to CdCl2 and BaPD, followed by significant reductions at 24h. Furthermore, cytochrome c levels in cells exposed to the combination of BaPD and CdCl2 were substantially lower than those observed with either treatment alone. Phosphorylation of H2AX increased in hBEC exposed to CdCl2 or BaPD, with higher levels observed in cells treated with BaPD. Conclusion', ' Our results suggest increased DNA damage in hBEC after 24h of exposure to Cd and BaPD. We also observed decreased cytochrome c levels after exposure to BaPD and/or Cd, suggesting disruption of mitochondrial functions. This effect was more pronounced in cells exposed to the mixture.']",

        "Meeting_name":" HIF-2 alpha is required for the tumor stemness switch of cancer cells during hypoxia/oxidative stress.",
        "Background":"['Tumor is characterized by intermittent hypoxia and re-oxygenation that generates oxidative stress. The effect of acute hypoxia microenvironmental stress on the cancer cell behavior is not clearly known. We hypothesized that hypoxia/oxidative stress could re-program cancer cells to a highly aggressive and metastatic state, we termed \"tumor stemness state\" (1). To test the hypothesis, we have characterized an in vitro model of acute hypoxia/re-oxygenation (2), and identified a highly tumorigenic and metastatic side-population cells (SP) phenotype from a diverse groups of established cancer cell lines including neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and small cell lung cancer (3). These post-hypoxia SP cells (henceforth known as SPhox cells) exhibited high metastatic activity, localization in the hypoxic niche, and expressed several stemness associated genes including Nanog, Oct-4 and Bmi-1 (3). In this present study, we report further characterization of the SPhox cells including the expression of stemness associated transcription factors, expression of inflammatory cytokines and receptors, and the putative interaction of SPhox cells with bone marrow (BM) stem cell niche. First, SPhox cells expressed very high level of Nanog, Lin 28, MYC and HIF-2 proteins. Second, SPhox expressed inflammatory Toll-like receptors. Third, SPhox cells increased tolerance to ROS-inducing agents. Fourth, SPhox cells, when co-cultured with mouse BM Sca-1 cells, the CD271+ fraction, enriched in mesenchymal stem cells (4) was expanded. This expanded CD271+/Sca-1+ cells exhibited high expression of Nanog, Lin28, Oct-4, MYC and HIF-2alpha and ABCG2. Furthermore, the conditioned media obtained from the CD271+/Sca-1+/ABCG2+ cells maintained the stemness of the SPhox cells for two weeks. These results indicated the potential interaction between the SPhox and CD271/Sca-1+ cell. However, these characteristics of SPhox cells were transient, reversible, and lasted only for 3-4 weeks, indicating an underlying transient re-programming mechanism behind the SPhox phenotype. Because, recently we discovered a HIF-2alpha dependent transient reprogramming of human ES cells (5), here we investigated the potential role of HIF-2alpha in the re-programming of SP cells to SPhox cells. We found that the specific siRNA gene silencing of HIF-2alpha reduced the SP to SPhox reprogramming by sixteen-fold. Thus, here we have further characterize the tumor stemness state, including the potential role of HIF-2alpha. We suggest that this tumor stemness state could be the part of the cancer cell defense mechanism persist, and reactivate the aggressive/metastatic phenotype of cancer.1. Das B.

        "Background":"['Hyperactivation of the oncogenic K-RAS pathway leads to increased cell proliferation, tumor growth, and oxidative stress associated with increased ROS production, heightened mitochondrial bioenergetics, and altered cancer metabolisms. Downstream of the K-RAS pathway, Seven-In-Absentia human Homolog (SIAH) is required for proper ERBB/RAS signal transduction. Human peroxiredoxin (PRDX) is an antioxidant protein, whose precise role in modulating oxidative stress during oncogenesis remains to be elucidated. Increased levels of oxidative stress alter the bioenergetics and functional integrity of mitochondrial biology under cellular stress. This study aims to elucidate the biological interaction previously detected between PRDX and SIAH2 via biochemical assays. We plan to investigate the functional role of SIAH2-PRDX interaction in modulating the stress response and adaptive cell survival in K-RAS-driven tumors. Also, we would like to investigate the biological significance of SIAH2-PRDX interaction in response to increased cellular stress in K-RAS-driven human cancer cells treated with standard chemotherapies.Mitochondrial tracking (MITO-tracker) was used to evaluate mitochondrial integrity of SIAH-proficient and SIAH-deficient human lung (A549) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cells over six days. Immunofluorescence staining and bright field imaging were performed using DOX-inducible human breast (MDA-MB231) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cells to compare changes in organelle integrity and mitochondrial morphology, altered expression of the oxidative stress biomarker and cell death biomarkers in response to induction of the SIAH- proficient and SIAH-deficient states in highly aggressive human cancer cells.By using human pancreatic cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs), we found that the antioxidant protein PRDX is significantly upregulated and co-expressed with SIAH in human pancreatic tumor biospecimens. It seems that PRDX is an indicative biomarker of cellular and oncogenic K-RAS-induced oxidative stress in human pancreatic cancer. By blocking SIAH2 function downstream of the K-RAS signaling pathway, oxidative stress levels were markedly increased, evidenced by mitochondrial aggregations and dysfunction in both human lung and cervical cancer cells. In response to anti-SIAH2 therapy, human TNBC, NSCLC and cervical cancer cells underwent dramatic morphological changes due to the significant loss of cell junction, focal adhesion and cell attachment. These data have shown that anti-SIAH2-based anti-K-RAS and anticancer therapy is highly effective in inducing massive cell death in several highly invasive and metastatic cancer lines. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of anti-SIAH2-induced cellular stress and cell death may contribute to the future drug development and validation of a new and effective anti-SIAH2-based targeted therapy against metastatic human cancer in the future.']",
