Twelve had available follow-up biopsies, 5 with a progressive disease (PD), 8 with a stable disease (SD), 1 with a partial response (PR). Follow-up biopsies were tested for c-KIT secondary mutations, gene copy number variation and expression related to angiogenesis, apoptosis and proliferation. IHC staining was performed on sections at baseline and after treatment for c-KIT, p-ERK, p-AKT and p-MEK.  Results', '  C-KIT expression was confirmed in all patients treated with nilotinib at baseline. The presence of a c-KIT exon 11 or 13 mutations was associated with clinical response. No secondary c-KIT mutations were detected at progression. c-KIT gene copy number revealed an amplification in 5 out of 25 patients prior to treatment without association with response rate. However, 1 SD patient had a decrease in c-KIT amplification after treatment. VEGFR-2 gene copy number whose co-amplification with c-KIT is frequent in other solid cancers was not associated with clinical outcome. pMek and pErk decreased in some SD and PR patients, with no variation of pAKT. Interestingly, using transcriptomic analyses FGF2 overexpression prior to treatment was observed in all PR and SD patients studied.  Conclusions', '  Clinical response is associated with c-KIT exon 11 or 13 mutations, and not with the sole amplification of c-KIT.

This approach is now widely used to interrogate simple somatic mutations but experience with the analysis of copy number variations (CNV) is still limited. Here, we retrospectively analyzed CNVs in 822 cancer cases (n = 135 melanoma, n = 468 non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), n = 219 colorectal cancers (CRC)) that were sent to our institution for routine molecular profiling using a semiconductor based sequencing platform. Amplifications and deletions inferred by MPS coverage data were independently validated by a qPCR assay. We observed a decreasing frequency of CNV in clinically actionable genes from melanoma to NSCLC to colorectal cancer.Of 56 melanomas with genetic aberrations in BRAF, 31 showed co-occurring CNV in other genes, mainly affecting CDKN2A. Some tumors (5 cases each) revealed clustered deletions affecting either ABL1, NOTCH1, and RET or STK11, GNA11, and JAK3. 8.1% of the cases had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In the group of NRAS mutant tumors (n = 39), 26 showed co-occurring CNVs in other genes, such as CDKN2A and FGFR3, and 9 NRAS mutant cases were additionally mutated in BRAF. 19.1% had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In contrast to BRAF mutant tumors, we did not see any specific CNV clusters. In the group of BRAF/NRASwt tumors (n = 11), we observed 5 cases with co-amplification of KDR, KIT, PDGFRA and another 6 cases with KIT mutations. While co-amplified cases had many gene deletions, KIT mutated tumors harbored only very few genetic aberrations in other genes.Across both NSCLC data sets, we identified 14 cases with amplified EGFR (10 of them harboring co-occurring EGFR mutations) and detected 8 NSCLC with KRAS amplifications (of which 7 had co-occurring mutations of KRAS). KRAS mutated tumors displayed frequent amplifications in MYC (n = 10) and MDM2 (n = 5). Of the 22 BRAF mutant tumors, two harbored mutated KRAS. In contrast to melanoma, we observed no clustering of CNVs in BRAFmut NSCLCs. Within the group of KRAS/EGFR/BRAFwt tumors, we identified 15 cases harboring genetic aberrations in MET (n = 8 mutations, n = 7 amplifications).Compared to melanoma and NSCLC, the number of CNV in CRC was rather low. IGF2 amplifications were most prevalent (n = 13) followed by MYC (n = 9). Two cases showed amplified wild-type alleles of KRAS. Two KRAS mutant tumors showed concomitant amplification of NRAS and three cases harbored amplified EGFR.In conclusion we demonstrate that i) detection of CNVs by targeted MPS data obtained from FFPE material is feasible and ii) could be validated independently, iii) this approach enables detection of known CNV patterns, and iv) uncovers new CNV patterns in clinically actionable targets across cancers.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma causes the greatest morbidity and mortality of all skin cancers and often harbors amplifications or activating mutations in KIT, a type III transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) involved in cancer cell growth, migration, invasion and metastasis. At present, no treatment that provide either sufficient response rates or a significant prolongation of overall survival are available for melanoma. In the last decade, several inhibitors of RTK (RTKi) have been developed for the treatment of cancer, however, a number of short-comings was observed. Therefore, novel TK inhibitors with improved selectivity were developed for the treatment of diseases associated with KIT activation. Masitinib (AB1010), a RTKi capable of blocking selectively KIT, is one such new drug. Using B16 melanoma subcutaneous graft on C57Bl6 mice, we demonstrate that Masitinib is able to limit tumor growth in vivo and increase mice survival. This anti-tumoral effect was not observed for other RTKi targeting KIT. Suprisingly, Masitinib has no effect on melanoma proliferation in vitro, suggesting instead that modulation on tumor environment takes place. Indeed, mast cells that accumulate in the tumors secrete several biologically active factors involved in the modulation of tumor growth. In vivo, Masitinib treatment completely abrogates mast cell maturation and migration resulting in decreased tumor invasion and down-regulation of several angiogenic factors. Using a mouse line deficient for mast cells (Wsh/Wsh), we confirmed that Masitinib effect is in part dependent of its inhibition on mast cell migration and maturation. Indeed, additional effect occurs on macrophage polarization leaning from tolerogenic toward anti-tumoral phenotype. Furthermore, in vivo macrophage depletion favored tumor promotion and reverses Masitinib effect on tumor growth. The results provided by this study suggest that Masitinib may be a useful therapy on melanoma by its dual role on tumor environment. It can block mast cell maturation and infiltration in the tumor site, avoiding the angiogenic effects of mast cells. It can revert tumor tolerent macrophage status leading to an increased inflammatory activity within the tumor microenvironment.These effects are not observed only on melanoma, but also on other types of cancer, suggesting the cellular mechanisms triggered by Masitinib occur in various tumoral process. For instance, a phase III clinical trial with Masitinib as GIST treatment is currently ongoing.']",

NRAS genes were mutated in 26% of TCGA samples and 13% of cell lines. Cell lines were 34 times more likely to bear a KIT mutation than TCGA samples. Mutations in each of the 8 tested genes except PTEN were found in TCGA genome samples, while cell lines contained mutations in BRAF, KIT, NRAS, PTEN, and lacked any of the tested mutations in AKT1, KRAS, HRAS, PIK3CA. Cell lines exhibited a higher frequency of unique mutational combinations. Both BRAF and KIT were mutated in 13% of cell lines, and each of NRAS and KIT; NRAS and PTEN; and NRAS, BRAF and PTEN in 3.3% of cell lines; all these combinations were absent in TCGA melanoma genomes. Mutations in PIK3CA combined with either BRAF or NRAS were found in 1% of TCGA samples but absent from cell lines. Conclusions', ' These data indicate that mutational status and frequency of individual mutations and mutation combinations found in melanoma cell lines can diverge from that observed in clinical tissue specimens. Additional changes observed in cell lines may provide insight into evolutionary mutations in progressive melanoma. Understanding of genetic profiles of cell lines may provide additional information in their sensitivity to pathway inhibitors.']",

However, KIT activation plays a critical role in a subpopulation of melanomas especially those in acral locations and melanomas on chronically sun damaged skin. We analyzed exome and RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Network (321 cutaneous melanomas in the data set) to identify patterns unique to KIT activation. The melanomas were divided based on known mutually exclusive mutations (BRAF, NRAS and KIT) vs those without (WT). We compared RNA data between each group. KIT group had significantly higher expression of KIT than BRAF, NRAS and WT (p<0.01, FDR<0.01) and isoform 2 expression was higher than 1. KIT melanomas were found to overexpress Wnt pathway, pigmentation and genes involved epithelial-mesenchymal transition. From the exome data, germline SNPs with incidence in ethnic groups (Caucasian, Asian and African) and more likely to be present in a specific melanoma groups were selected. Comparing the 3 ethnicity groups across the 4 tumor groups Asian SNPs were significantly enhanced in KIT tumors, African in WT and Caucasian in BRAF and NRAS melanomas. We evaluated the tumors for the primary type of genetic damage. The three signatures that appeared most divergent were CC>TT for UV, (G/A)C(G)>(G/A)T(G) for deamination, and G>T for oxidative damage. UV and deamination appeared inversely proportional, while oxidative damage appeared to be independent of those other two features. KIT and WT had a greater% of non UV high deamination tumoral environments. A fraction of these tumors also had very high oxidative signatures. We then compared 2 KIT subgroups UV vs non UV (absence of CC>TT mutations) for germline ethnicity differences. Asian SNPs were highly increased in non UV subgroup whereas Caucasian SNPs were in UV subgroup. Further, we divided KIT non UV subgroup into deamination and oxidative damage subgroups and compared ethnicity differences. Deamination was significantly higher in Asians whereas oxidative damage was higher in Caucasians. A similar analysis was done to the WT group, where African SNPs were significantly increased in the non UV subgroup and were primarily associated with oxidative damage. This data implies that KIT mutant melanomas develop in a unique genetic and mutational environments and makes this an ideal system to in which study racial disparities at the molecular level.']",

Methods', ' Human melanoma cell lines were screened by mass-spectroscopy based genotyping for KIT mutations, and a cell line with an endogenous L576P KIT mutation was identified. The cell line was treated in vitro with a panel of small molecule KIT inhibitors and the effects on cell viability were quantified. Molecular modeling of the interaction of the inhibitors with the KIT L576P mutant protein was determined to estimate binding affinity. PET/CT studies were performed on patients with mucosal melanoma harboring the L576P mutation pre- and post-dasatinib treatment. Results', ' We have identified the first human melanoma cell line with an endogenous L576P mutation, the most common KIT mutation in melanoma. In vitro testing demonstrated that this cell line is resistant to imatinib, nilotinib and sorafenib (0 - 1 uM), KIT inhibitors shown to be effective in non-melanoma cells with other KIT mutations. However, the mutant cell line was inhibited by dasatinib at concentrations as low as 10 nM, and was significantly more sensitive than melanoma cell lines with wild-type KIT (p = 0.02). No difference in sensitivity to Src inhibitors was observed, supporting that this sensitivity was due to KIT inhibition. Molecular modeling demonstrated that the L576P mutation induces structural changes in KIT that reduce the affinity for imatinib but not for dasatinib. Two metastatic melanoma patients with the L576P KIT mutation were treated with dasatinib, including one patient previously treated with imatinib. Both patients had marked reduction and elimination of tumor FDG- avidity by PET imaging after dasatinib treatment.

Methods', ' Skp2 protein levels were measured in 122 metastatic melanoma specimens using immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the association between Skp2 overexpression and post-recurrence survival was examined. Moreover, 22 cell lines (2 normal primary melanocytes, 2 primary immortal melanocytes, 4 primary melanoma cell lines, and 18 metastatic melanoma cell lines) were evaluated for Skp2 genomic amplification using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) arrays (Affymetrix 6.0) and Skp2 gene expression using mRNA arrays (Affymetrix U133A 2.0) and quantitative RT-PCR. We also screened 18 cell lines for Skp2 mutation by sequencing. Results', ' Skp2 overexpression, defined as >25% tumor cells, was associated with shorter 3-yr post-recurrence survival (37%) compared to Skp2 expression 25% (55%) (HR=1.89, 95%, CI= 1.04, 3.42, p=0.04). Skp2 overexpression was significantly associated with the site of melanoma metastasis', ' visceral (n= 12; 89%), lymph node (n=49; 36%), brain (n=15; 14%), and soft-tissue (n=36; 6%) (p<0.001). SNP array revealed genomic amplification at the Skp2 locus in 6 (33%) metastatic cell lines and one primary melanoma cell line. Skp2 genomic amplification was associated with increased transcript expression. No Skp2 mutations were identified. Conclusions', ' Skp2 protein overexpression is associated with worse prognosis in metastasis in melanoma. Our results also support that gene amplification, rather than a Skp2 gene mutation, may be the major mechanism responsible for Skp2 aberrant expression in metastatic melanoma.']",

Addiction of melanoma to the MAPK pathways led to the development of inhibitors targeting either mutant BRAF, such as Vemurafenib (PLX4032), or MEK. Melanoma treatment recently met a breakthrough with the clinical evaluation of Vemurafenib that demonstrated an unprecedented 80% response rate among patients with BRAF V600E melanomas treated with Vemurafenib, but rapidly limited by drug resistance, which still requires to be elucidated.The MAPK pathway regulates the expression of many genes which can mediate therapeutic response but also resistance, such as RhoGTPases. We analysed the mRNA expression of the RhoGTPases in two BRAF mutated melanoma cell lines, WM266-4 and A375, in response to inhibition of the MAPK pathway by PLX4032. We observed that the mRNA of RhoB was increased by PLX4032 treatment. This result was confirmed in many other BRAF mutated melanoma cell lines by inhibition of the MAPK pathway with BRAF inhibitors (PLX4032 or SB-590885) as well as MEK inhibitors (AZD6244 or AS703026). MEK inhibitors (AZD6244 or AS703026) upregulate RhoB in BRAF wild-type melanoma cells harbouring N-Ras, K-Ras or c-KIT mutation suggesting that inhibiting MAPK pathway is critical for RhoB expression modulation. It is noteworthy that this modulation is cell type dependent, while it was not found in BRAF mutated non-melanoma cells as colon carcinoma cells (Colo205 and RKO).To investigate the role of RhoB induction in cellular responses to BRAF and MEK inhibitors, the RhoB induction was suppressed using RNA interference. The cells treated with siRNA targeting RhoB, WM266-4 and A375 cells, were more sensitive to PLX4032 and AZD6244. Moreover the blockade of RhoB induction led to a significant increase of PLX4032-induced apoptosis as shown by the increase of the subG1 population and PARP cleavage.Our findings show that RhoB upregulation is involved in PLX4032 response and both inhibitions of MAPK pathway and RhoB expression trigger cell death and should prompt a search for agents. Indeed co-targeting MAPK and RhoB pathways, could lead to a synthetic lethality and prevent resistance to either BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Ongoing work focuses on confirming this role in tumour-xenografted mouse models.']",

Uveal melanoma is characterized by oncogenic mutations in Gnaq and Gna11, which activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK). Furthermore, both primary and metastatic UM are characterized by genetic abnormalities, including the amplification of the chromosomal arm 8q and monosomy of chromosome 3, which are significantly associated with poor prognosis. The oncogene MYC, which is located on 8q24.1, is amplified in nearly 70% of uveal melanoma, and is also regulated by the MAPK pathway. Chromatin regulators have become attractive targets for cancer therapy. In particular, the BET-bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 has shown selective inhibition of c-Myc expression, followed by the suppression of c-Myc-dependent target genes. We examined the effects of JQ1 in a panel of 8 UM cell lines, including cell lines with Gnaq/Gna11 mutations (92.1, Omm1.3, Mel270, Mel202, Omm1), a cell line with MYC amplification (Mel290), and cells without either mutation or amplification (C918, Mel285). The Gnaq/Gna11 mutant cells were the most sensitive to growth inhibition at nanomolar concentrations of JQ1 (IC50=200nM), followed by the cell line with amplified MYC (IC50=1M), while the cells without mutation or amplification exhibited little inhibition. We also examined the biochemical effects of JQ1 treatment, which caused a dose- and time-dependent suppression of c-Myc as well as survivin, XIAP, ERK1 and E2F1, while p21and the pro-apoptotic protein Bim were induced in all the cell lines. Interestingly, JQ1 also suppressed the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL and induced PARP cleavage only in the Gnaq/Gna11 mutant cells. Flow cytometric analysis indicated a cell cycle arrest in G1 in all the cell lines and an apoptotic population in sub-G1in the mutant cells. Furthermore, treatment with JQ1 resulted in significant antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models of uveal melanoma with Gnaq mutation.

From 1999 to 2011, 12 non-Caucasian patients (8-Filipino, 3-Pacific Islander and 1-Vietnamese) histologically confirmed to have ALM were evaluated at a tertiary institution. Data including age, gender, tumor location, Breslow thickness, Clark level, ulceration, regression, and mitoses per mm squared were compiled. Direct sequencing (c-KIT [Exons 8,9,11,13,17,18], NRAS [Exons 2,3]) and real-time PCR (BRAF [Exon 15]) was performed on formalin-fixed/ paraffin-embedded archived biospecimens (primary lesions). Results', ' Our findings demonstrated that 7/12 (58%) patients exhibited the triple negative genotype.

The analysis of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) provides a powerful tool for the continuous assessment of treatment responses in melanoma patients.We have established a robust pipeline for the serial, prospective analysis of ctDNA in melanoma patients. By combining next generation sequencing (NGS)- and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)-based approaches we make ideal use of currently available technologies. To date, plasma samples from over 120 individuals have been collected, with follow-up times surpassing one year in many cases.For routine monitoring of patients commencing BRAF-mutant targeted therapies, pre-treatment DNA, derived from tumour biopsy or plasma, is tested to confirm the exact BRAF mutation and rule out pre-existing resistance-associated mutations using a custom NGS sequencing panel. Timely follow-up throughout treatment is achieved by measuring mutant BRAF fractions in ctDNA using ddPCR. When increasing BRAF variant allele frequencies are detected, additional ddPCR-based profiling for NRAS mutations and NGS-based re-sequencing for other resistance-associated mutations is initiated. We demonstrate superiority of ctDNA monitoring over LDH measurements and present a strategy to detect emerging resistant disease ahead of clinical scans in a cost-effective, timesaving and low technology way.In addition to the basic characterization of BRAF-mutant cases undergoing targeted therapy, we have used the analysis of ctDNA to uncover clonally distinct tumour sub-populations resulting in complex responses to treatment. For instance, we monitored a case of metastatic vaginal mucosal melanoma undergoing sequential targeted, immuno- and chemotherapy. Despite the presence of a KIT mutation in the primary tumour, response to KIT inhibitor imatinib was mixed. In the absence of tumour biopsies, we used whole exome-wide NGS of ctDNA to study the underlying mechanisms. This strategy revealed a KIT-mutant tumour sub-clone that responded to imatinib and a second sub-clone including an SF3B1 mutation that did not respond. The sub-clones also responded differentially to immunotherapies, but both responded to chemotherapy.The analysis of ctDNA is a powerful approach to monitor responses to systemic therapies in melanoma. By providing early warning of resistance and crucial information of clonal composition/evolution of the disease, ctDNA analysis has the potential to revolutionize the implementation of precision medicine.']",

Integrative analysis revealed hard-wired genomic aberrations and associated transcriptomic consequences. These genomic aberrations included clusters of oncogenes brought together by structural variations, which cooperated in their amplifications and subsequent up-regulated expressions. We believe that these hard-wired genetic changes are biologically significant; they sustain the survival of the tumor and offer the advantage of the distant metastasis. We reconstituted the architecture of melanoma progression and maintenance and we identified gene cassettes with a putative role in sustaining tumor growth. The correlation of these gene cassettes with the cancer phenotype and the feasibility of these putative oncogenes as candidates for targeted therapy were addressed using cell-based assays on a high content screening platform. Analysis of the matched cell lines derived from the same patient offered a valuable resource for in vitro manipulation, testing of drugs and functional validation. A detailed molecular characterization of the functionally validated genes and their contribution in the cancer signaling pathways will provide a better understanding of the molecular basis of tumor evolution.']",

        "Background":"['The BRAFV600E mutation is frequently observed in over 60% of melanomas. Development of the small molecule inhibitor PLX4032, which specifically targets the mutated BRAF protein, offers a novel therapeutic approach by effectively blocking the activation of key signaling molecules of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, such as Mek and Erk, effectively leading to arrest in cell proliferation. Provided that MAPK signaling targets the micropthalmia transcription factor (MITF), which is linked to the expression of various melanoma associated antigens (MAAs), we hypothesized that the inhibition of BRAFV600E can modulate the expression of MAAs. Since MAAs are essential in the development of a melanoma vaccine, due to their increased immunogenicity, altering their expression can be a useful immunotherapeutic approach to targeting melanoma. Using patient derived melanoma cell lines, which express various MAAs; our laboratory has developed a vaccinia virus based immunotherapeutic vaccine. These melanoma cell lines have been characterized by their status of BRAFV600E mutation and found to be either homozygous or heterozygous for the mutation. Inhibition of two key MAPK pathway molecules, namely Mek and Erk, denotes that the melanoma cell lines are responsive to PLX4032. Phenotypically, the cells invasive and migratory properties were also modulated upon treatment with PLX4032. Moreover, we observed that the expression of various MAAs was enhanced upon treatment with PLX4032. An amplification of gp100, MART-1 and tyrosinase expression on the RNA level as well as on the protein level was observed. Lastly, expression of MMAs was conserved in vivo following the analysis of melanoma cell xenografts in BALB/c nude mice. Based on our observations in that PLX4032 modulates MMA expression, further studies are warranted to determine the clinical effectiveness of combinational immunologic therapy using BRAFV600E inhibitors with our vaccinia virus melanoma cell line derived preparation.']",

Interestingly, 4 stage IV patients included in our series presented discordant BRAF mutation status on different sites (1 patient with a WT primary tumor (PT) and a V600E lymph node (LN) metastasis; 1 patient with a V600E PT and WT LN metastasis; 2 patients with a V600E PT, V600E LN and WT liver metastasis). We were able to detect the expected BRAF mutation in circulating DNA for all these patients.  Conclusions', '  The sensitivity of our procedure, based on approved kits, suggests a high interest for use in clinical practice, even for non-V600E mutations.

Despite its prominence, the biology of BM remains poorly understood.  Several theories of BM development exist, including the linear progression model, which suggests that the metastatic capabilities of tumor cells develop at primary sites following the accumulation of alterations. The parallel progression model argues that tumor cells disseminate early and accumulate changes independently at the secondary site.  We compare the tumor profiles of BM from common cancers to understand the biology and to identify differential treatment strategies.  Methods', ' Tumor samples were profiled using a multiplatform service (Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ), including sequencing (Sanger, NGS), protein expression (IHC) and amplification (ISH).

No significant differences were found in 48 genes between BM and the primary tumor sites, with the exception of PIK3CA in breast cancer, which was mutated less in BM vs. the breast samples (10% vs. 26%, p=0.02). In contrast,  expression of TOP2A, TOPO1 and TS, and amplification of EGFR, were more prevalent in BM as compared to the primary sites (Table).  Conclusions', '  A similar genetic landscape with limited differences was seen in BM of NSCLC, melanoma and breast cancer compared to primary tumors.  The limited differences are more consistent with a linear progression model of cancer metastasis. Additionally ,this suggests that both primary tumor and BM would respond to similar chemotherapeutics with the consideration of effective blood-brain barrier-penetrant drugs. Small molecule inhibitors of EGFR could be considered due to increased EGFR amplification and the higher TOP2A, TOPO1 expression prompts consideration of topoisomerase inhibitors like etoposide or irinotecan.

Matrix chips were assayed on a Sequenom MassArray MALDI-TOF Mass Array system. Visual inspection and Sequenom Typer software were used to perform genotyping based on mass spectra. We compared two independent melanoma cohorts, one from Ireland (SVUH cohort; n=97) and the other from Belgium (Leuven cohort; n=60).Results', ' Intriguingly, patients from Ireland showed significant lower BRAFV600E mutation rates (19.0%) when compared to the mutation frequency seen with the Belgian cohort (43.3%) or with the mutation frequency reported by other studies on non-Irish populations (50-70%).

Although the number of NRASQ61 mutant cases was slightly higher among the Irish melanoma patients compared with Belgium patients (20.6% and 13.3%, respectively), this does not fully account for the difference in BRAFV600E mutation rate. In contrast, many BRAFV600 WT patients in the SVUH cohort carried significantly increased mutation rates in MET (11.4%) compared to the Leuven cohort (0%) and reported elsewhere (2%). c-MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that activates multiple signal transduction pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, WNT, and Notch.

Mutation rates of the other examined genes were always <5% and did not significantly differ between the groups.Conclusion', ' Our observation of reduced BRAFV600E mutation rates in Irish patients will directly impact future treatment strategies for these patients.

The detection of CTCs has gained increasing interest for prediction of clinical outcome. However, it remains to be determined whether uveal melanoma cells circulating in a peripheral vein predict systemic recurrence and poorer overall prognosis.Uveal melanoma, the most common primary cancer of the eye in adults, is unique in that the uveal tract is devoid of lymphatics. Since systemic recurrence develops exclusively via hematogenous spread, patients with uveal melanomas present a special opportunity to explore the prognostic potential of CTCs. Although the lung is the first organ through which venous drainage from the affected eye passes and indeed the only organ through which all venous blood must pass, 80-95% of systemic metastases are found first in the liver without development of lung metastases. To address these issues, we investigated the numbers of CTCs in paired arterial (femoral) and venous (antecubital) blood specimens obtained from uveal melanoma patients with hepatic metastases.Methods', ' CTCs in blood specimens were measured in 17 uveal melanoma patients with multiple hepatic metastases, including 10 patients with liver-only metastases and 7 patients with hepatic and extra-hepatic metastases. Peripheral arterial and venous blood specimens were collected at the same time prior to liver directed treatment. CTCs were analyzed using CellTracks Circulating melanoma Cell Kit by CellSearch System. The clinical information and sources of blood specimens were blinded when CTCs were analyzed.Result', ' CTCs were detectable from all 17 arterial blood specimens (100%) (median 5, range 1 to 168).

More importantly, there is no significant correlation between numbers of arterial CTCs and the degree of tumor volume in the liver in patients who have liver-only metastases.Conclusions', ' Using this technology, the detection of uveal melanoma cells in peripheral blood is feasible. Peripheral capillary beds effectively filter CTCs from venous blood; thus venous blood might not be the best source for measurement of CTCs in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. The paucity of clinically evident non-hepatic metastases despite the effective filtration by peripheral capillary beds remains unexplained and may be a demonstration of the seed and soil hypothesis.

The promoter mutations typically affect both alleles and occur over a highly conserved DNA region. The mutations are predicted to disrupt a canonical Ets Like Factor 1 (ELF1) binding site. In total, these data imply aberrant NF-kappa B signaling as a pathogenic feature of desmoplastic melanoma. Commonly mutated oncogenes in melanomas, in particular BRAF V600E and NRAS Q61K/R, were absent. Instead, other genetic alterations known to activate the MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades were identified in 73% of samples, affecting NF1, CBL, ERBB2, MAP2K1, MAP3K1, BRAF, EGFR, PTPN11, MET, RAC1, SOS2, NRAS, and PIK3CA. Rb and p53 pathway alterations occurred respectively in 71% and 66% of tumors, affecting RB1, FBXW7, CDK4, PPP6C, CCND1, CDKN2A, TP53, and MDM2. Finally, TERT promoter mutations or amplifications occurred in 90% of tumors. The consequences of the mutations on protein expression levels was confirmed by immunostaining for NF1, EGFR, Rb, CDK4, CCND1, p16, p53, and Mdm2. Collectively, many of these oncogenic mutations are potentially druggable. In conclusion, desmoplastic melanomas harbor distinct genetic alterations that explain their unique biology, and this study illuminates genetic biomarkers and nominates targets for therapeutic intervention.']",

Methods', '  Samples (6 ml) of peripheral blood were drawn from patients with colorectal (CRC, n= 19) and thyroid (n= 1) cancers and melanoma (n= 8). CRC tumors were KRAS wild-type (n= 3) or carried the BRAF V600E (n= 6), KRAS G12D (n= 9) and G12V (n= 4) mutations. All melanomas and the thyroid cancer carried the BRAF V600E mutation.

Ca2+ homeostasis plays a pivotal role in proliferation in cancer cells, but little is known about the role of Ca2+ in melanoma. Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is defined as Ca2+ entry from extracellular space triggered when Ca2+ store in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is depleted. SOCE is regulated by coordination between Orai (ORAI calcium release-activated calcium modulator) in the plasma membrane, and STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) in the ER. We examined the role of Ca2+ in melanoma cells especially focusing on SOCE. Method', ' Intracellular Ca2+ level was measured by using Fluo4-AM, a Ca2+-sensing fluorescent dye. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Cells were stained with propidium iodide and cell cycle was assessed using flow cytometer. Protein phosphorylation microarray was performed by using a commercially available kit (Cancer Signaling Phospho-Antibody Array). Results', ' SOCE, as demonstrated by enhancement of Ca2+ entry from extracellular space after Ca2+ depletion in the ER, was observed in SK-MEL-2, C8161, SK-MEL-24, UACC257 (human) and B16 (mouse) melanoma cell lines, suggesting that the existence of SOCE is universal among melanoma cells. SOCE was attenuated by Pyr3, a pyrazole compound which is known to inhibit SOCE, as well as by EGTA that chelates extracellular Ca2+. Pyr3 inhibits cellular proliferation in SK-MEL-2 cells (IC50', ' 5.1uM) and C8161 cells (IC50', ' 2.1uM).

Patients enrolled on the trial had either unresectable, locally advanced Stage III or Stage IV melanoma. We analyzed patients tumor samples for 74 mutations in 13 genes using a custom iPlex (Sequenom). We have preliminarily analyzed 157 tumor samples from patients enrolled in this clinical trial. Analysis of the initial data set demonstrates that 62 samples (42%, 62/148, 95% CI 34%,50%) carried BRAF mutations - 60 samples with V600 and two samples having a BRAF V601 mutation. Thirty eight samples (26%, 38/148, 95% CI 19%,33%) were positive for NRAS mutations, with 33 with Q61, two G12 and three G13 mutations. With the exception of one tumor sample, the BRAF and NRAS mutations were negatively correlated with each other, consistent with prior observations. We also observed a number of rare mutations in our samples including one in AKT1, one in AKT3, four in CDK4, five in beta-catenin, two in GNAQ and three in KIT. The results of this study demonstrated no difference between the two treatment arms in OS and PFS and no association with treatment outcome and BRAF and NRAS mutations. Consequently, the treatment arms were collapsed, and we examined the relationship of BRAF and NRAS mutations with OS and PFS. Interestingly, our data demonstrated that the BRAF and NRAS mutations did not correlate with OS or PFS. This sample population is unique in that it provides a large data set of melanoma tumor samples, all of whom were entered on a clinical trial, unselected for pre-existing mutations. Using the Sequenom assay platform, we have identified a number of mutations in a subset of genes known to be involved in melanoma in patient tumor samples. In the future, these tumor samples will be informative as we continue to examine and identify additional genetic alterations in melanoma, providing information regarding the natural history and distribution of certain mutations. Future studies will use array comparative genomic hybridization to further investigate additional somatic mutations occurring in melanoma tumors and correlate these with clinical outcome, as well as provide insight into the pathogenesis of melanoma.

Anti-tumor activity of E7080 was correlated to % of pericyte coverage in groups 1 and 2, in which  tumor vessels are sensitive to E7080. DNA microarray analysis demonstrated decreased FGFR1-4 expression in BRAFmu melanoma, while qPCR analysis showed that FGFR2 and FGFR3 expression were significantly higher in BRAFwt than BRAFmu in human melanoma tissues. E7080 inhibited in vitro proliferation of BRAFwt melanoma, which overexpressed FGFR3. Knockdown of FGFR3, FRS-2a, NRAS and AKT-3 genes with siRNA transfection inhibited proliferation of E7080-sensiteve melanoma.  Conclusions', '  BRAF/PTEN mutation status was associated with pericyte coverage of tumor vessels and the expression of FGFR1-4 in a panel of melanoma cell lines. E7080 showed superior anti-tumor activity against BRAFwt melanoma, in which the type of tumor vessels was sensitive to angiogenesis inhibition by E7080 and a subgroup of which were dependent on FGFR3 signaling.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Multiple cancers, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and melanoma, have been shown to be caused by somatic activating mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT. The major cause of death in patients with advanced KIT-mutant cancers is due to the development of KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant (TKI-resistant) metastatic disease. Drug resistance arises almost exclusively from secondary mutations within KIT, highlighting the importance of KIT in the proliferation and survival of these tumors. Methods', ' We performed a human kinase siRNA screen in multiple KIT-mutant cancer cell lines using viability as a read out. We defined candidate targets as those whose knockdown decreased viability in all cell lines. Validation and mechanistic studies were done using a library of KIT-mutant GIST and melanoma cells. Results', ' We identified lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) as candidate target in three KIT-mutant cell lines. LMTK3 silencing reduced the viability of all KIT-mutant GIST and melanoma cells tested to date, including cell lines with KIT TKI-resistance mutations. Importantly, LMTK3 silencing decreased the viability of KIT-mutant cells specifically, but not that of KIT-independent GIST and melanoma cells. Further, we found that decreased cell viability was due to induction of apoptosis, as assessed by measuring caspase 3 and 7 activity within 96 hours of LMTK3 silencing. LMTK3 knockdown also reduced tumor growth in vivo in a GIST xenograft model. Because these cells depend so heavily on KIT and the loss of KIT signaling results in cell death, we hypothesized that LMTK3 silencing may affect this pathway. Indeed, LMTK3 silencing decreased levels of autophosphorylated KIT. We also observed a significant decrease in total KIT protein expression. This phenotype and corresponding viability was rescued with exogenous expression of full length LMTK3. Conclusions', ' LMTK3 is an important regulator of oncogenic KIT expression and activity in KIT-mutant GIST and melanoma and represents a novel, tractable target.']",

In addition, we screened a panel of melanoma cells with a highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 (PD-991) and performed gene expression and mutation analysis on these cells to explore possible genomic predictors of sensitivity.Genomic analysis revealed that 75% of primary melanomas had at least one CNV in the CDK4 pathway, with 55% showing a loss of CDKN2A. 28% of melanomas had two or more CNVs and melanomas with two or more CNVs involving CCND1 had worse overall survival (HR 5.56, P=0.02).

Here, we leveraged the largest collection to date (n = 1929) of mutational and protein profiles of metastatic melanoma patients, the Caris Molecular IntelligenceTM database, to investigate molecular and actionable drivers. This database is purposefully skewed towards BRAF and NRAS wild-type tumors, making it particularly suitable for our analysis. Methods', ' We analyzed immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next generation sequencing (NGS) data available for 906 patient samples for which BRAF and NRAS status was available from Caris.

Of these individuals, 8,420 died, including 5,400 men and 3,020 women. According to the ACS for 2010, the 5-year survival rate for stage IV melanoma is 15% to 20% and the 10-year survival is 10% to 15%. To improve survival it is important to establish which genes are involved in the regulation of metastasis in melanoma as potential targets for prevention and/or treatment. Our laboratory compared the differences in the relative expression levels of metastasis genes from two human melanoma cell lines and a normal melanocyte cell line. The normal melanocyte cell line was assayed in duplicate and averaged as an inner plate control in order to validate the assay. Established melanoma, SK-mel-103 and SK-mel-147, were investigated. Template cDNA was prepared from total RNA from these lines using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit. The melanoma cell lines were both male and matched on GPR-30 and ER beta expression and B-RAF and N-RAS mutation status but they differed in G2 checkpoint and p16 mutation status. RT Array technology was utilized to compare the relative levels of mRNA from metastasis related genes expressed in SK-mel lines. The Human Tumor Metastasis RT2 Profiler PCR Array contains 84 primer pairs that amplify genes involved in human metastasis. Genes on this array include those that regulate cell adhesion, the extracellular matrix components, cell cycle, cell growth and proliferation, apoptosis, and transcription factors and regulators. The PCR array is a set of optimized real-time PCR primer assays on a 384-well plate for pathway focused genes and includes appropriate RNA quality controls. The quantitative PCR was run on the ABI 7900 HT using the real-time PCR cycling program. Total RNA from normal and melanoma tumors were characterized and the relative expression levels for each gene in the two melanoma samples were plotted against each other and against the normal cell line in scatter plots. Gene expression with controls samples was highly correlated. Genes involved in metastasis were up or down regulated in the melanoma cell lines compared to the normal cell lines. Upregulation of genes associated with DNA replication has previously been correlated with metastatic aggressiveness in melanoma cell lines. Conversely the down regulation of genes has been associated with an increase in cellular adhesion and melanocyte differentiation.

Recent clinical evidence demonstrated the anti-melanoma effect of combined mutant BRAF inhibition and MEK inhibition. We determined the effect of metformin in combination with mutant BRAF and MEK inhibition on melanoma proliferation and the possible mechanisms.Methods', \" Human melanoma cells (SK-23, Mel888, Mel1861) were treated with Metformin (1-20 mM), PLX4032 (a mutant BRAF inhibitor, 1-20 uM), AZD6244 (a MEK inhibitor, 1-20 uM), or combination. Cell proliferation assay was performed using Cell Titer Blue assay. Western blotting was performed to determine the expression of PARP, caspases-9, LC3A/B,Beclin1, pERK, pMEK, AMPKa, p70S6, and p4E-BP1. GAPDH was used as internal control. Autophagy was further analyzed with immunofluorescence with LC-3 and NECN1 anti-antibody for visualization of lysosomal morphology and evaluated under the Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (20). DAPI was used to counter stain the nucleus. Apoptosis was further analyzed with flow cytometry using FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences). Data were presented as means  SD for the three separate experiments. For comparison between groups, the student's t test was used and p< 0.05 was considered to be statically significant.Results\", ' There was dose-dependent inhibition of melanoma cell proliferation with either metformin(M), PLX4032(P), and AZD6244(A). Addition of M to PA combination had synergistic effect on the anti-melanoma proliferative effect of PA. Significantly increased expression (p<0.05) of apoptosis markers (PARP and caspases-9) and autophagy markers (LC3B and Beclin1) were observed in cells treated with PAM compared with PA. Enhanced induction of autophagy with the triple drugs was confirmed by visualization of autophagosome and autolysosome formation on immunofluorescence. Synergistic effect on apoptosis was confirmed on Annexin V assay. The PAM combination treatment also lead to significant enhancement of AMPK activation and increased phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr-172 compared with metformin alone (p<0.01). The addition of M to PA combination resulted in inhibition of mTOR signaling with decreased phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 in treated cancer cells, when compared with PA or M alone.Conclusion', ' We have observed a synergistic effect on suppressing human melanoma proliferation with the addition of metformin to combined inhibition of mutant BRAF and MEK. The synergism is due to enhanced inhibition of mTOR signaling pathways.']",

In a previous genomic screening, we identified copy number amplification of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 in 47% of ALM cases, a higher frequency than previously reported in cutaneous melanomas (CM) (5%). Here, we tested the hypothesis that increased EZH2 expression contributes to ALM progression and may confer selective sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition. Methods', ' EZH2 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 51 primary (21 stage I, 13 Stage II and 17 Stage III) and 23 metastatic (11 in transit, 8 nodal and 4 visceral) ALM cases with extensive clinicopathological data and protocol-driven follow up. Colony formation and cell proliferation was assessed following treatment of ALM and CM cell lines with three EZH2 inhibitors, including GSK126, currently in clinical trials. The effect of GSK126 on H3K27me3 and downstream EZH2 targets was analyzed by western blotting. Results', ' EZH2 is commonly overexpressed in both primary (30/51; 65%) and metastatic (20/23; 87%) ALM cases, with a significant increase in mean IHC score between primary and metastatic tumors (1.9 vs. 2.7, respectively, p = 0.047). EZH2 expression increased in 6/10 metastatic ALM tumors compared to their matched primary tumors. ALM tumors with EZH2 gene amplification showed increased EZH2 protein expression; however more cases showed overexpression with no amplification suggesting a potential epigenetic component of EZH2 regulation. GSK126 significantly suppressed ALM colony formation at lower doses compared to CM (1 M vs. 5 M, respectively). EZH2 inhibition also increased expression of the downstream tumor suppressor E-cadherin in ALM but not in CM cell lines. Finally, ALM cell lines had significantly lower basal H3K27me3 levels than CM cell lines, suggesting an additional, histone methyltransferase-independent function of EZH2 in ALM. Conclusions', ' Our data demonstrate thatEZH2 upregulation is common in ALM, and suggest that it may play a role in ALMs metastatic progression that requires further investigation. Selective sensitivity of ALM cell lines to EZH2 inhibitors supports the therapeutic potential of EZH2-targeted therapy in ALM.']",

Primary objective of the phase II is PFS at 12 weeks and 32 patients were recruited at the recommended (45 planned). Secondary objectives evaluate tumour vascularization by dynamic contrast enhanced ultrasonography (DCE-US), PK profile of TMZ, number and function of circulating lymphocytes, melanoma RNA expression profiles and mutational status (BRAF, NRAS, c-KIT, PTEN, PI3K, cat), circulating endothelial and progenitor cells. Results', ' 13 evaluable pts were included in the phase I. The recommended doses are SOR', ' 400 mg bid and TMZ', ' 150 mg/m2 /d every other week. Toxicity was manageable.

Five pts presented rapid and massive metastases necrosis with obvious tumour cavitation on CT which is very unusual during the course of melanoma treatment. Devascularization seen on DCE-US after 1 month was predictive of tumour response. Integrated correlative biological parameters are being analyzed and will be presented. Conclusions', ' SOR+TMZ association is well tolerated and gives promising results in some patients with metastatic melanoma. Unexpected major tumour necrosis has been observed in 5 patients.

        "Background":"['Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignant tumor in adults. There currently is no effective treatment for metastatic UM. UM differs from cutaneous melanoma in that it lacks BRAF, NRAS, or KIT mutations but instead harbors mutations in the Gq family members GNAQ and GNA11 in over 80 to 90% of cases. Understanding the downstream effector pathways of these oncoproteins is of considerable interest to identify opportunities for targeted therapy. Using 293T cells, immortalized mouse and human melanocytes, we find that GNAQQ209L or GNA11Q209L induce activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) and MAPK pathways. ShRNA mediated knock-down of mutant GNAQ abrogates both PKC and MAPK activation in human melanoma cell lines or model systems. Using two different PKC inhibitors we found selective extinction of PKC and MAPK signalling and induction of G1 arrest in panels of melanoma cell lines carrying GNAQ or GNA11 mutations, whereas no such effect was observed in melanoma cell lines with other mutations. MAPK activation occurred downstream of activated PKC in cells with GNAQ or GNA11 mutations. In contrast to PKC inhibitors, which selectively inhibited the growth of melanoma cell lines with GNAQ or GNA11 mutations, the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 inhibited melanoma cell lines irrespective of their GNAQ/11 mutation status. In vivo the PKC inhibitor AEB071 slowed the growth of tumors in an allograft model of GNAQQ209L transduced melanocytes, but did not induce tumor shrinkage. Analysis of tumor lysates identified suppression of PKC signaling but not of MAP-kinase pathway signaling under chronic PKC inhibition. The rebound of MAP-kinase activation could be overcome using a combination of AEB071 with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901, which showed strong synergy in halting proliferation and in inducing apoptosis. Our data suggest that PKC is a rational therapeutic target for melanoma patients with GNAQ or GNA11 mutations and indicate that a combination therapy with MEK inhibitor is superior to treatment with either approach alone.']",

A majority of cell lines were found to be sensitive to PD-991, although there was a distinct population of resistant cell lines. In sensitive melanoma cell lines, treatment with PD-991 resulted in loss of hyperphosphorylated RB and a concomitant G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Treated cells displayed an enlarged flattened morphology and an increase in SA--galactosidase staining compared to vehicle controls, indicative of cellular senescence. RB-null cell lines were resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition, and did not display cell cycle arrest or senescence. Expression and mutational analysis was performed to identify additional genomic predictors of sensitivity and resistance. Loss of CDKN2A/p16 correlated with sensitivity to PD-991 (p<0.02), and this was confirmed at the level of protein expression. Mutation of p53 and the corresponding low expression of p53 targets p21 and MDM2 correlated with resistance (p<0.0001). There was no increase in p53 transcriptional targets or evidence of apoptosis in response to PD-991 treatment of sensitive cells, and senescence occurs in both p53 WT and mutant cells, indicating that this response does not require functional p53. However, in p53 WT cells, combination treatment with PD-991 and the p53 pathway activator Nutlin3a results in increased sensitivity to PD-991 compared to treatment with PD-991 alone. This additive effect is not observed in p53 mutant cells, suggesting there is a functional role for WT p53 in the response to PD-991.Conclusions', ' These preliminary data identify RB, p16 and p53 as predictors of response to PD-991, and support further evaluation of CDK4/6 inhibitors in melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['The fact that melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, is driven by multiple combinations of genetic lesions has supported the use of genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models in validating the etiological and biological roles of oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Most of the currently studied mouse melanoma models are driven by RAS/RAF/MAPK activation via activating RAS or RAF mutations in combination with loss of INK4A/ARF or PTEN; therefore, BRAF/NRAS wild-type melanoma remains less well characterized and the overall survival of patients with metastatic BRAF/NRAS wild-type melanoma remains poor.In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that NEDD9 could synergize with the loss of PTEN and INK4A/ARF in melanoma tumorigenesis. This hypothesis is based on our observation of an inverse correlation between PTEN expression and levels of NEDD9 gene expression in human melanoma samples. NEDD9 (neural precursor derived, developmentally downregulated gene 9) was previously identified by us as a target of a recurrent focal amplification, associated with acquisition of metastatic potential in the RAS-Ink/Arf model. We have shown that NEDD9 is up-regulated in 3550% of metastatic melanomas and enhances proliferation and invasion. First, we demonstrated that NEDD9 cooperated with PTEN loss in Ink4a/Arf-/- melanocytes to enhance cell proliferation, anchorage independent growth, and invasion in vitro. Additionally, when melanocytes were injected into nude mice either subcutaneously or intravenously, NEDD9 overexpression facilitated increased tumor growth and lung seeding, respectively. Further analysis showed that NEDD9 expression correlated with increased phosphorylation of ERK, SFKs (Src family kinases), AKT2, and STAT3. Of these pathways we have demonstrated through the use of small molecule inhibitors that both ERK and AKT2 signaling are required for the enhanced anchorage independent growth observed in NEDD9 overexpressing melanocytes. In addition, we generated a mouse model based on loss of PTEN and INK4A/ARF with or without NEDD9 upregulation. To do this, we generated a tet-inducible NEDD9 allele that carries a doxycycline-responsive, melanocyte-targeted NEDD9. These mice were crossed with a strain containing floxed PTEN and INK4A/ARF in combination with a melanocyte-targeted CreERT2. The development of cutaneous and ocular melanomas in these mice was enhanced by NEDD9 induction. This study will generate a body of knowledge for the in vivo roles of NEDD9 in melanoma tumorigenesis and identify signaling pathways that could be therapeutically targeted to treat patients with BRAF/NRAS wild-type melanoma']",

Many prevalent genetic alterations in this disease implicate activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways in melanoma. While the detection of activating BRAF, NRAS, and KIT mutations is relatively standardized, evaluation of PTEN, a tumor suppressor that inhibits the PI3K-AKT pathway, is challenging due to its regulation by epigenetic mechanisms. In order to understand the molecular correlates of PTEN expression in clinical specimens, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for PTEN in a CLIA-certified laboratory at the MD Anderson Cancer Center on a cohort of FFPE melanomas with mutational and proteomic data from frozen tissue from the same tumors. The expression of PTEN in the tumor tissue was compared to staining intensity in internal positive controls (i.e. endothelial cells), and was scored as Absent, Markedly Reduced, Mildly Reduced, or Normal/Increased. In a cohort of 93 tumors, Absent PTEN expression was observed in 21%, Markedly Reduced in 23%, Mildly Reduced in 36%, and Normal/Increased in 18%. PTEN expression was not evaluable in 1 tumor, and 2% of tumors showed clonality of PTEN expression in the tumors with distinct areas of Normal/Increased and Absent PTEN expression. Absent PTEN expression was detected in 38% of BRAF mutant, 0% of NRAS mutant, and 11% of Wild-type tumors. Quantitative proteomic data generated by reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis of the frozen tissue demonstrated that tumors with Absent PTEN by IHC had significantly lower PTEN (p<0.001), and higher levels of P-AKT Thr308 (p=0.004), P-AKT Ser473 (p=0.008) and P-P70S6K (p=0.01) than tumors with Reduced/Normal/Increased PTEN expression, consistent with increased activation of the downstream signaling by the PI3K-AKT pathway. In contrast, tumors with Markedly Reduced PTEN had lower levels of PTEN expression by RPPA than the Mildly Reduced and Normal/Increased PTEN tumors (p=0.046) but they did not exhibit significant differences in P-AKT or P-P70S6K. In light of these results, PTEN expression in subsequent samples was scored as Absent, Present, or Clonal. PTEN IHC of 323 distant metastases identified Absent PTEN expression in 18%, Clonal expression in 2%, and PTEN Present in 79% of resected stage IV melanomas. Among tumor sites with at least 15 samples available for analysis, the rate of Absent PTEN expression was relatively high in CNS (n=39; 28%) and intestinal metastases (n=76; 30%), but was lower in lung (n=147; 10%) and liver (n=18; 6%). Twenty six patients had tissue available from both CNS and extracranial metastases; the concordance rate of PTEN Absence in the paired specimens was 77%.

        "Background":"['Malignant melanoma (MM) is one of the most aggressive cancers that affect humans. It is the most common and fatal skin cancer, with an incidence that is critically increasing in Western populations (15 times in the last 40 years) and for which, in the advanced stages, there is no effective therapy. The search for new compounds able to control it is therefore essential. The hydroxylated biphenyl compound (3E,3E)-4,4-(5,5,6,6-tetramethoxy-[1,1-biphenyl]-3,3-diyl)bis(but-3-en-2-one), namely D6, a structural analogue of curcumin, showed a strong antitumor activity on MM cells both in vitro and in vivo, as we have recently described [1]. The mechanisms of action of this compound are not clear yet, but it inhibits cancer cells growth by inducing apoptosis without affecting normal fibroblasts growth. Firstly we investigated the ability of D6 to enter cells by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. The LC-MS data showed a quick cellular uptake of D6 with a maximum peak after about 2 hours. To investigate on the effects of D6 treatment on the cell cycle progression in MM cells, we performed flow cytometry analysis, which evidenced a cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Gene expression profiles analysis using Illumina high-density microarrays, was carried out on D6 treated MM cells and normal fibroblasts allowing the identification of 599 transcripts whose expression was modulated by D6 treatment in MM cells but not in normal fibroblast. The analysis of results, performed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software, showed the centrality of CDKN1A gene, encoding p21, a major negative cell cycle regulator, which was strongly over expressed, while cyclin B and cdc25 phosphatase, showed both to be down modulated. Other genes which expression interestingly appeared to be decreased by D6 activity were the oncogenes c-kit and PI3K, suggesting a down regulation of both c-kit mediated and PI3K/AKT signal transduction pathways driving to cell proliferation. Modulation of expression of these specific genes has been confirmed at a protein level by western blotting analysis.

        "Background":"['Knowledge on the regulatory pathways involved in melanoma development and progression has advanced significantly in recent years. It is now recognized that multiple signaling pathways that affect motility, growth control, invasion, metabolism, cytokine release and the ability to escape the immune response, regulate melanoma development. Silencing of SOCS-1 protein, a negative regulator of Jak/Stat pathway, leads to partial reversion of the tumorigenic phenotype of B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells. SOCS-1 silencing with shRNAi inhibits in vitro growth by cell cycle regulation with S phase arrest and increased size of cells and nuclei. It also inhibited tumor cell migration and invasion. Down-regulation of SOCS-1 decreased the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (mainly the phosphorylated-R), Ins-R, and fibroblast growth factor receptors. Based on the results of SOCS-1 silencing, the present work aims at analyzing the expression of proteins relevant to tumor development, searching for signaling pathways related with SOCS-1. A protein microarray analysis of murine melanoma cells silenced for SOCS-1 by shRNAi SOCS-1 lentivirus transduction was undertaken using as controls, cells transduced with the empty vector. Among the 614 differentially expressed genes some cytokine/growth factor receptors were down regulated, e.g. c-kit, met and EphA3. Western blotting of B16 shR-SOCS-1 cell extracts showed a significant decrease in the expression of these receptors, indicating that SOCS-1 positively regulates the MAPK pathways in these cells. We analyzed the main MAPK pathways that were up regulated in melanoma and observed a decrease in the phosphorylation of mediators of ERK1/2 and p38 pathways and of STAT3 (S727). These results demonstrate that SOCS-1 can play an important role in tumor development and progression up regulating a number of growth factor receptors in murine melanoma cells. Interestingly, p-CREB (S133) was up regulated in the SOCS-1-deficient B16F10-Nex2 cells. In vivo experiments showed that using a prophylactic protocol, the subcutaneous immunization of syngeneic mice with B16 shR-SOCS-1 viable cells, rendered a protective effect against subcutaneously grafted and metastatic murine melanoma, with significant reduction in tumor growth and metastates in the lungs. A flow cytometry assay showed decreased expression of PD-L1 at the surface of B16 shR-SOCS-1 cells. This might explain the protective effect of subcutaneous immunization with these cells, rather than with wild-type B16F10-Nex2 cells that overexpress PD-L1, which negatively regulates T-cell immune response. Down regulation of PD-L1 is compatible with inactive ERK. The present results show the important role of SOCS-1 in murine melanoma stimulating cell growth and migration, allowing for the invasive phenotype.']",

A major advantage of this system is the ability to model the multi-step process of carcinogenesis in immune-competent mice using retroviral-mediated gene delivery. Mutant BRaf has been demonstrated to cooperate with Pten loss to induce metastatic melanoma in mice but the role of Akt in this context has not been evaluated. This is relevant because 60% of human melanomas contain amplification and activation of AKT. In this study, we evaluated the role of mutant Braf in melanoma initiation in the context of Ink4a/Arf loss and Akt activation. Ink4a/Arflox/lox mice expressing the viral receptor TVA specifically in melanocytes under control of the dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) promoter were crossed to Ptenlox/lox mice and mice carrying a conditional BrafV600E allele, which can be activated by Cre expression (BrafCA). Cohorts of newborn mice were injected subcutaneously with retroviruses containing Cre recombinase. Melanoma developed in 100% (8/8) of the DCT-TVA/BrafCA mice following Cre mediated Braf activation combined with Pten and Ink4a/Arf loss; median survival was 62  6.7 days in this cohort. The incidence was reduced to 43% (6/14) if Pten was retained (Pten+/+ mice); median survival of tumor bearing mice in this group was 72  6.7 days. Kaplan Meier survival analysis revealed a highly significant difference between these cohorts (P = 0.01). Interestingly, Akt expression could substitute for Pten loss in this context. Melanoma developed in 88% (15/17) of the DCT-TVA/BrafCA mice following viral delivery of activated Akt and Cre, which mediated Braf activation combined with Ink4a/Arf loss; median survival of tumor bearing mice in this group was 60  6.6 days. Kaplan Meier survival analysis revealed that there was no significant difference between cohorts with Pten loss or Akt expression (P = 0.658). Expression of virally delivered Akt in the absence of Cre did not lead to tumor formation in control cohorts (0/7) and no uninfected mice developed melanoma (0/14). Histological examination of the tumors generated in the BrafCA mice with delivery of Cre and Akt viruses demonstrated that they were very similar to tumors lacking Pten. Importantly, the tumors were similar to human melanoma consisting primarily of short spindle cells exhibiting high grade nuclear features and prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures were abundant, and some tumors possessed giant cells with epitheliod features. Occasional neoplasms exhibited regions of necrosis. Extensive lung metastases were evident following Pten loss or Akt expression, but not in tumors lacking activation of Akt, confirming a role of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in melanoma progression and metastasis. Our ongoing experiments seek to further characterize the role(s) of the PI3K/AKT pathway in melanoma progression.']",

We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and complimentary RNA-seq of 23 tumor tissue samples from 21 patients. Six of these tumors were WT for BRAF and NRAS, so we studied these cases further. The SNV load in the WT samples is more variable than the BRAF or NRAS driven melanomas. The median number of SNVs/Mb ( SD) for BRAF mutant (n = 9), NRAS mutant (n = 7) and BRAF WT/ NRAS WT (n = 6) samples were', ' 12.2  8.0, 42.2  82.7 and 12.6  90.2 respectively.

The median numbers of SNVs ( SD) were 374  638.3, 577  518.3 and 146.5  1221.6 respectively. The p-value for the comparisons BRAF vs. WT and NRAS vs. WT were 0.087 and 0.002 respectively (two-tailed Mann-Whitney test). We identified the somatic mutations that are specifically enriched for double wild-type samples and observed that the top two hits, NF1 (30.2% in double WT vs. 5.7% otherwise) and KIT (15.8% in double WT vs. 0.8% otherwise) are known driver gene candidates for wild-type melanomas, but we also find other novel candidate driver genes. Thus, we present a framework for identification of driver mutations and therapeutic targets in double wild-type melanomas and integration of these types of data with other large datasets such as those derived from RNA-seq and RPPA will assist in the development of approaches to stratify double wild-type patients for targeted or immune-therapies.']",

Complementary molecular markers are not available for routine prognostic assessment.We have previously identified and validated a prognostic nine-gene signature expressed in fresh-frozen (FF) primary cutaneous melanomas (training cohort', ' n=91; validation cohort', ' n=44). A signature-based risk score predicts patient overall survival (OS) independently of AJCC staging (multivariate regression analysis', ' p = 0.0004; hazard ratio', ' 3.8). However, clinical application requires adaptation to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) melanomas.Therefore, we have transfered signature expression analysis onto FFPE melanomas. From FFPE melanomas matching the training and validation cohorts of the above FF melanoma study (n=125), RNA was prepared and transcribed into cDNA. Following cDNA pre-amplification, expression of the 9 signature genes, 2 additional candidate genes, and 3 housekeeping genes was quantified by real-time PCR. Correlation of gene expression with OS was evaluated using Cox regression analysis. Expression of a signature of 8 out of 11 genes (risk gene', ' KBTBD10; protective genes', ' DCD, GBP4, COL6A6, PIP, SCGB1D2, SCGB2A2, KRT9) was associated with OS in univariate regression and Kaplan Meier analysis. A signature-based risk score predicted OS independently of AJCC staging (multivariate analysis', ' p=0.0059, hazard ratio 3.09). The misclassification rates were 20% overall, 13.8% for low risk, and 5.7% for double low-risk (combined with AJCC staging). The risk score complemented and refined conventional AJCC staging. Thus, the FF melanoma risk score was successfully transfered onto FFPE melanomas.In order to validate the FFPE melanoma risk score, we analyzed signature expression in an independent cohort of 130 selected FFPE melanomas, which were particularly difficult to classify by AJCC staging (misclassification rate 40.8%), in order to stringently test the performance of the risk score. The misclassification rate of the FFPE melanoma risk score was comparable, even slightly better (39.2%) than that of AJCC staging, confirming its prognostic performance.The FFPE melanoma risk score was also externally validated in a Molecular Diagnostics Lab (Dermatologikum Hamburg). The concordance of melanoma classification exceeded 85%, demonstrating technical robustness of the risk score.We have established and independently as well as externally validated a quantitative, robust prognostic FFPE melanoma risk score that is complementary to AJCC staging in predicting outcome. This demonstrates clinical applicability and allows retrospective risk assessment of melanomas. The score identifies patients at low risk, not identified by AJCC staging, and defines high-risk patients in need of adjuvant therapy.']",

Methods', '  Pre-treatment and post-relapse biopsies were obtained from BRAFV600melanoma patients treated with vemurafenib or dabrafenib. Whole exome sequencing of tumor and normal samples was performed to identify exome-wide mutations, insertion/deletions, and chromosomal copy number alterations. Since somatic allelic fraction comparisons across treatment time points must account for variable stromal admixture between biopsies, novel algorithms were applied to impute purity and tumor cell ploidy, thus determining the cancer cell fraction (CCF) of each alteration.

In the intrinsic resistance cohort (on drug < 12 weeks, n=12), multiple putative resistance mutations not previously observed in the setting of acquired resistance were identified.  Conclusions', '  In addition to reported genetic resistance mechanisms, we identified new MEK1 mutations in resistant samples.

Molecular targeted therapeutics against BRAF and MEK have shown marked efficacy for patients with metastatic melanoma. However these targeted therapies have a limited duration of response. Palbociclib is a highly selective inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) that has been shown to inhibit growth of malignant cell lines in vitro and in vivo by preventing the phosphorylation of Rb and stopping the progression G1/S of cell cycle. Cyclin D-CDK4/6-Rb axis has been shown to be dysregulated in 85-90% of melanomas and may represent a new therapeutic target. Our main goal in this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of palbociclib in a large panel of human melanoma cell lines to identify potential biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance. Material and Methods', ' We evaluated the response to palbociclib treatment in 48 melanoma cell lines. A comprehensive biomarker screen was performed using mutation and gene expression (Agilent) data. The mechanism of action of the drug was investigated by western blot (WB) analysis measuring phospho-Rb and senescence markers. Effects on the cell cycle and apoptosis were study by flow cytometry. Results', ' A marked differential response to palbociclib was observed across the melanoma cell lines with IC50s ranging from 28nM to over 1M. A subset (14/48) of cell lines were classified as sensitive at clinically achievable concentrations (IC50<150nM). BRAF and NRAS activating mutation did not correlate with sensitivity in vitro. Increased expression of genes correlating with cyclin D-CDK4/6 activation strongly predicted for palbociclib sensitivity. We also found that genomic and expression markers of activation of the hedgehog/smoothened (SHH) pathway strongly predicted for in vitro resistance to palbociclib. These markers included chromosomal amplification of SHH, and high baseline expression of SMO and GLI2. Protein analysis by WB showed a dramatic decrease in phospho-Rb protein only in sensitive cell lines and also it caused a decrease in FOXM1 protein, indicating palbociclib may partially act by inducing senescence in treated cells. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that palbociclib induces a strong G1/S arrest, but not significant apoptosis. Conclusion', ' Nearly 30% of the melanoma cell lines evaluated were found to be sensitive to palbociclib in vitro. Response to palbociclib did not correlate with BRAF and NRAS mutational status. A gene expression signature for CDK 4/6 activation successfully identified those cell lines most sensitive to palbociclib. We also identified markers of hedgehog/smoothened/GLI activation that strongly predicted for resistance to palbociclib.

Here, we present the adaptation of this method to a semi-automated workflow, including automated single cell detection and isolation by DEPArrayTM technology for subsequent molecular analysis of DCCs from SLN of melanoma patients.The developed workflow includes a mechanical disaggregation of lymph node tissue and collection of the mononuclear cells after Percoll density centrifugation. Several tumor cell enrichment methods were tested (CellSearch and size-based enrichment technologies), however, failed to process cell suspensions generated from lymph nodes due to clumping of cells during the enrichment procedure. Tumor cell enrichment using MACS depletion of CD45+ cells delivered approx. 50% of spiked-in cell line cells with a mean depletion rate of lymphocytes and erythrocytes > 98%. To prevent limitations in DCC detection caused by phenotypic heterogeneity of tumor cells, we established a double staining against two melanoma-associated markers gp100 and MCSP. Individual melanoma cells are then detected and isolated by DEPArrayTM technology enabling single cell whole genome amplification (Ampli1TM) for subsequent molecular analysis as assessment of copy number alterations (e.g. by arrayCGH) or sequence analysis for melanoma specific point mutations (e.g. BRAF or NRAS). We successfully applied the workflow to first SLN samples from melanoma patients.The established workflow enables a standardized detection of single DCCs from lymph nodes of melanoma patients applicable in clinical diagnostic labs.

Tumor cell expression of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-1R) is a marker of poor prognosis in primary uveal melanoma. IGF-1 is produced mainly in the liver, which may account for the hepatic tropism of uveal melanoma. Therefore, we investigated the importance of IGF-1/IGF-1R interaction in hepatic metastases.Methods', ' The expression pattern of IGF-1R in hepatic metastases of uveal melanoma was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a series of archival samples from patients treated at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. To investigate the biological role of exogenous and endogenous IGF-1 on the growth of a uveal melanoma, a long-term, cell line obtained from a hepatic metastasis (TJU-UM001) was evaluated concurrently.Results', ' All 24 metastases stained positive by IGF-1R. Tumors showed 80-95% of cellular staining while adjacent normal liver showed negative staining. IGF-1R was expressed in both the cytoplasm and the exterior membrane of uveal melanoma cells. As previously reported (AACR 2010, Abstract #359), more than 90% of TJU-UM001 cells expressed IGF-1R on their surface and did so at approximately 1.2 x 104 IGF-1R per TJU-UM001 cell. The cell proliferation assay (Quick Cell Proliferation Assay Kit II; BioVision, Mountain View, CA) showed that quiescent TJU-UM001 was induced to proliferate by 2.6-fold (p<0.001) in response to exogenous IGF-1 at 300 ng/ml. Conversely, anti-IGF-1R antibody completely blocked the exogenous IGF-1-induced growth of TJU-UM001. IGF-1 preferentially induced phosphorylation of Akt (S473) in quiescent TJU-UM001 cells and this was blocked by anti-IGF-1R antibody. Cell proliferation kinetics analysis showed TJU-UM001 grows briskly in serum-free medium (SFM) and anti-IGF-1R antibody significantly inhibited growth. Correspondingly, TJU-UM001 maintained in SFM expressed mRNA for IGF-1 and furthermore secreted IGF-1 protein. Both anti-IGF-1 and anti-IGF-1R antibodies independently inhibited the spontaneous proliferation of the cells in SFM (p<0.05) suggesting a critical role for endogenous IGF-1 expressed by TJU-UM001 cells.Conclusion', ' Although the strong and extensive expression of IGF-1R in archival tissue specimens suggests paracrine stimulation via IGF-1R as a major mechanism of the growth of uveal melanoma in the liver, cell proliferation in SFM and the endogenous production of IGF-1 by tumor cells indicate an autocrine mechanism via IGF-1R is also operative. The results underscore a key role of IGF-1 in promoting the growth of uveal melanoma. The present study shows autocrine and paracrine mechanisms underlay IGF-1-induced uveal melanoma growth and indicate how these mechanisms can be targeted to suppress metastatic growth and improve clinical outcome.']",

        "Meeting_name":" LMTK3 is a novel regulator of oncogenic KIT in KIT-mutant cancers",
        "Background":"['Multiple cancers, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and melanoma, have been shown to be caused by somatic activating mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT. The major cause of death in patients with advanced KIT-mutant cancers is due to KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant metastatic disease. Resistance develops almost exclusively because of secondary mutations within KIT, highlighting the importance of KIT in the proliferation and survival of these tumors. Therefore, strategies that affect KIT protein expression and maturation may be therapeutic. In order to identify regulators of KIT that may represent novel targets, we performed an siRNA screen in multiple KIT-mutant cancer cell lines. From these screens we identified lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) as a novel KIT regulator and potential target in KIT-mutant cancers. LMTK3 has been implicated as an important protein in multiple cancers, including leukemia, breast, and colon cancer. However, the oncogenic function of LMTK3 is not entirely clear. Despite its name, lemur tyrosine kinase 3 is, in fact, a serine/ threonine kinase. Beyond its enzymatic kinase function, LMTK3 has also been shown to have important scaffolding functions. LMTK3 has not been previously known to interact with KIT, but does regulate the stability of other receptors. We have found that LMTK3 silencing reduced the viability of all KIT-mutant GIST and melanoma cells tested to date, including those with ATP binding pocket and activation loop resistance mutations. Importantly, LMTK3 silencing decreased the viability of KIT-mutant cells specifically, as silencing of LMTK3 in cells lacking KIT mutations did not affect their viability. Further, we found the decrease in cell viability was due to induction of apoptosis, as seen by cleavage of PARP within 96 hours of LMTK3 silencing. Because these cells depend so heavily on KIT and loss of KIT signaling results in cell death, we hypothesized that LMTK3 silencing may be affecting this pathway. Indeed, with LMTK3 silencing there was a significant decrease in phosphorylated KIT (Y719), which was accompanied by decreased phospho-AKT (S473). We also observed a robust decrease in total KIT protein levels. However, there was no decrease in KIT transcript levels, suggesting that LMTK3 plays a role in regulating KIT at the protein level. While other KIT protein regulators, such as HSP90, have been suggested as therapeutic targets for GIST, the ubiquitous functions of these targets makes these treatments sub-optimal, often causing toxicity. Silencing of LMTK3, on the other hand, specifically kills KIT-mutant cancer cells. Furthermore, as a kinase, inhibition of LMTK3 by a small molecule may be possible, and we are in the process of identifying LMTK3 inhibitors. LMTK3 is a positive regulator of oncogenic KIT in GIST and melanoma and represents a novel, tractable target in KIT-mutant cancers.']",

        "Background":"['Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is an essential instrument to maintain genomic stability in eukaryotes especially towards ultraviolet radiation (UVR). There is profound knowledge of the mechanistic execution of NER, however its regulation is not well understood. Here we provide evidence that the lineage-dependent oncogene MITF regulates the functional interface between NER and transcription through transactivation of XPG and GTF2H1, which constitute core elements of the NER and general transcription factor machineries, respectively.For this purpose, flow cytometry and microscopy fluorescence assays were applied to evaluate the temporal repair kinetics of DNA lesions after UVR in the presence and upon depletion of MITF in human primary melanocytes and several melanoma cell lines. Moreover, ChIP and luciferase reporter assays were performed to show the in vivo occupancy and a MITF dependent transactivation of the XPG and GTF2H1 promoters. Transcriptome as well as tissue microarrays (TMA) analysis were used to demonstrate the relationship between MITF and TFIIH. Finally, in vivo experiments were performed utilizing a subcutaneous xenograft tumor model in SCID mice to confirm our hypothesis.Our results showed that the NER/TFIIH complex is controlled by MITF in the presence and absence of UVR mediated genotoxic attack resulting in nucleotide repair deficiency and breakdown of global transcription upon MITF depletion. Importantly, in primary human melanoma the TFIIH subunit GTF2H1, which is involved in NER and RNA transcription, is linked to MITF abundance and prognostic melanoma stage. Moreover, RNA-interference mediated repression of GTF2H1 led to a significant reduction in tumor formation in a melanoma xenograft model.Collectively, these results describe an unanticipated role of MITF in the regulation of intimately linked NER and transcription machineries in the melanocytic lineage, which is preserved upon transformation into melanoma. Through its control of the NER/TFIIH complex MITF might coordinately regulate repair and transcription processes, thereby optimizing the rapid resumption of transcriptional activity after completion of strand repair, which is vitally important for cellular survival. The very same mechanism may drive the genesis of melanoma and its progression in the context of aberrant transcriptional activity of MITF due to SUMOylation defective germline mutation or genomic amplification.']",

        "Background":"['Metastatic melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer that still has limited treatment options and dismal 5-year year survival rates as low as 15%. Only recently has there been significant progress in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, advent by molecular targeted drugs and immunotherapy, but their limitations are exposed as these cancers are quickly able to develop resistance. Dysregulation of apoptotic machinery in melanoma allows the cancer cells to evade cell death and contributes to treatment resistance. Up-regulation of Mcl-1, a member of the Bcl-2 family of anti-apoptotic proteins, has been correlated with melanoma progression and metastasis. Mcl-1 amplification is one of the most common genetic aberrations found in human cancers and has been labeled as a marker of aggressive oncogenesis and poor patient prognosis. Previous studies have pointed to Mcl-1 as a viable therapeutic target for the treatment of melanoma and conclude that small molecule Mcl-1 inhibitors may appeal this unmet medical need. We have discovered and characterized a new class of selective small molecule Mcl-1 inhibitors using various biochemical, functional, and cell based assays; further development of these compounds allowed us to achieve potent low-nanomolar binding affinity for Mcl-1 and more than 300-fold selectivity over Bcl-2/Bcl-xL. Our most potent inhibitor, 483-LM, was screened across a panel of human melanoma cell lines using a cell proliferation assay and revealed varying levels of sensitivity. A BH3 profiling assay demonstrates that C8161, the cell line most sensitive to our inhibitor, solely relies on Mcl-1 for survival. The Mcl-1 dependence of C8161 might contribute to the known metastatic nature of this cell line. Mechanistic studies revealed that 483-LM effectively engaged the endogenous Mcl-1 protein after treatment of C8161, as determined by a CETSA assay, and prompted disruption of protein-protein interactions between Mcl-1 and several pro-apoptotic proteins, including Bax, Bak and Bim. This was followed by induction of Bax/Bak dependent apoptosis and activation of hallmarks of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, including mitochondrial outer membrane depolarization, caspase activation, and PARP cleavage. Importantly, treatment with 483-LM caused massive up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Noxa, an effect apparent after an 8 hour treatment, which contributes to the induction of cell death. The in vivo efficacy studies with 483-LM showed significant effect on tumor growth and caspase-3 activation in tumor samples. Overall, our data indicate that Mcl-1 inhibitors are a promising treatment option for aggressive metastatic melanoma and warrant further preclinical investigation of 483-LM as a promising selective Mcl-1 inhibitor to be used as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and immunotherapy.']",

        "Background":"['BRAF and MEK inhibitors induce striking tumor regressions in BRAF V600E melanoma patients. However, relapse occurs in the majority of patients within several months. Reported resistance mechanisms include acquisition of NRAS mutations, PDGFR or IGF1R activation, Cot amplification, or truncated BRAF upregulation. We report here that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), neuregulin-1 (NRG1), and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) cause robust resistance in vitro to BRAF or MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines. NRAS mutant lines were similarly resistant to MEK inhibition in the presence of these growth factors. By contrast other mitogenic factors such as PDGF, EGF, NGF, BDNF, MSP, MDK, GRO, and IGF1 did not maintain cell viability or growth. HGF, NRG1 and FGF2 prevented growth arrest and cell death and in some cell lines maintained cells in progressive growth. In addition, HGF and NRG1 could prevent growth arrest after dual treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Western analysis revealed that HGF and NRG1 reactivated Erk signaling and activated S6RP and AKT phosphorylation. Combined pharmacological inhibition mTor signaling and Akt signaling was required to fully block growth factor-mediated proliferation. In addition, small molecule Met inhibitors and an anti-HGF antibody blocked HGF-mediated resistance, while lapatinib and an anti-NRG1 antibody blocked NRG1-mediated resistance. While combined Akt and mTor inhibition potently inhibited cell line growth independent of BRAF or MEK inhibition, lapatinib and Met inhibitors had minimal effect on growth, suggesting potential for less adverse events with receptor inhibitors. In vitro co-culture experiments revealed that primary cells present in normal skin can cause resistance, and we have identified growth factors produced by these cells that contribute to resistance. We are analyzing receptor activation (Met and Erbb3) and FGF2 expression in wildtype, NRAS, and BRAF mutant primary melanoma samples. In future experiments we plan to test clinical samples from patients treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors, and we hypothesize that HGF, NRG1, and FGF2 signaling is elevated in patients with poor initial responses or relapse to BRAF or MEK inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['Metastasis is responsible for the majority of cancer-related deaths. A limiting step in metastasis is access to circulation, thus circulating tumor cells (CTCs) should be present in all patients with metastatic tumors, which may have both diagnostic and prognostic value. Accounting for only 2-3%, carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) presents a challenge for clinicians in diagnosis and therapy. Tissue biopsy is the standard for diagnosis but there is need for improved methodology including a non-invasive blood test that may rely on CTC analysis. We have been developing a post-Veridex CTC analysis method using multiplexed Q-dot conjugated antibodies with the goal of detection of multiple markers in each single cell within a CTC population to aid in CUP diagnosis including tissue of origin. We have developed an immunofluorescence (IF) protocol with a minimal set of markers to predict the primary sites and provide prognostic information for common metastatic tumors', ' melanoma, lung, colorectal, upper gastrointestinal organs, and breast or prostate cancer. Two kits are available to isolate CTCs through Veridex CellSearch', \" melanoma kit (using melanoma antigen), and epithelial or carcinoma kit (using EpCam). A patient's blood is initially tested with both kits, and positive CTCs from the melanoma kit supports a diagnosis of melanoma, whereas positive CTCs from the epithelial kit supports carcinoma. For carcinomas, we use cytokeratin 7 (CK7), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), estrogen receptor (ER) or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as the minimal set of markers. IF has been optimized in cultured tumor cells, first with individual antibodies, then quantum dots (Q-dot) conjugated multiplex quadra-antibody set. We evaluated antibodies by IF specific to these 5 markers in lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer cell lines. The CK7 and ER antibodies conjugated to Qdot 605 and 705 respectively demonstrated expression in the appropriate cell lines. CK7-Qdot 605 and ER-Qdot 705 expression in cells that were recovered after being spiked into normal blood samples and isolated by the Veridex CellSearch system was similar to that observed with unconjugated antibodies. Our data show that it is feasible to detect expression using Qdot-labeled multiplexed antibodies on tumor cells isolated from blood by Veridex CellSearch system. Successful application of this protocol to CTCs in patient samples is expected to provide a noninvasive, relatively quick and inexpensive blood test that can be both diagnostic and prognostic, which may be a valuable adjunct to routine biopsy.\"]",

However, these effects are not observed in SK-MEL-2 cells; treated SK-MEL-2 cells show over-expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 suggestive of a rescue effect leading to lesser cytotoxic activity. The selective cytotoxicity observed in BRAF-mutated cells and not in wild type BRAF melanoma cell lines by both DT3 and simvastatin warrants further research into the potential therapeutic use of these combinations.

Comparison of primary and metastatic lesions demonstrated that demethylation occurs early during carcinogenesis with few additional alterations in advanced tumors. Parallel transcriptomic analysis revealed many known and novel oncogenic pathways aberrantly expressed and regulated by loss of DNA methylation.The colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) was aberrantly expressed and hypomethylated in nearly all cases. The expression of CSF1R was validated by immunohistochemistry on primary tumors and by Western blotting in BRAF V600E mutant and WT melanoma cell lines. Expression of its ligand IL34, but not of CSF1 was also shown in the melanoma cells by both ELISA and qPCR. The effects of a small molecule inhibitor, PLX3397 as well as shRNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor were investigated in traditional and 3D cell culture. We saw inhibition of cell growth, smaller colony size, increased apoptosis and decreased invasiveness - suggesting a functional role for CSF1R in melanoma.Treatment of melanoma with small molecule inhibitors of BRAF V600E is effective for a time, but resistance invariably develops. The feedback activation of EGFR, BRAF amplification, BRAF splice variants and others are known to aid in the acquisition of resistance and lead to rebound activation of the MAPK-pathway. In Western blotting experiments, the rebound of ERK phosphorylation after BRAF inhibitor treatment was accelerated with the addition of the CSF1R ligands CSF1 and IL34, or delayed with PLX3397, also attenuating AKT phosphorylation. Melanoma cells stably expressing CSF1R shRNA recapitulated the effects of the inhibitor. Assaying the cells at different time points during a long-term V600E inhibitory experiment, we saw increasing levels of the transcription factor RUNX1, followed by increasing levels of IL34 and of the CSF1R protein, as well as its maturation, evidenced by the appearance of the high MW form. Utilizing shRNA-mediated knockdown of RUNX1 resulted in lower levels of the CSF1R and IL34 transcripts and delayed the rebound. Analysis of primary RNA-Seq data showed an increase in RUNX1, CSF1R and IL34 expression as resistance was acquired. Co-inhibition of CSF1R and BRAF was also tested and resulted in synergistic blockade of cell growth in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo. The CSF1R inhibitor, PLX3397, is in clinical trials for breast and other cancers, and these data present a preclinical rationale for its study in malignant melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma has seen a remarkable improvement in the treatment of advanced disease. However, the majority of patients still relapse with the emergence of resistant disease. This is especially true for BRAF inhibitors, were multiple mechanisms of resistance have been uncovered. However, the lack of dependable models to develop approaches to overcome resistance, poses a real challenge for clinical decisions on second line therapies. In addition, combination therapies necessary to achieve long term responses increase the number of possibilities to be assessed. In this study, we developed patient derived xenograft (PDX) models from BRAF inhibitor resistant patients and, after characterization, tested rational second line combination therapies in co-clinical trials.Fresh tumor tissue from 12 patients after progression on vemurafenib or dabrafenib was implanted into immune deficient NSG mice. Once the tumor grafts were established, mice were continually dosed with PLX4720 to approximate clinical plasma levels to preserve the resistant phenotype. Xenografts were then characterized for genomic alterations and pathway activation status using a targeted sequencing array and a reverse phase protein array, respectively. We found at least 2 and up to 9 known deleterious alterations in all samples, many of which have been described as conferring resistance. The protein array clustered into two major groups', ' MAPK pathway activated and PI3K pathway activated, again consistent with previous reports. Integrating these data allowed us to design rational combination therapies for in vivo testing. We treated a PDX model with MET amplification and high phospho c-Met with the BRAF inhibitor LGX818 20mg/kg QD, the MEK inhibitor MEK162 3mg/kg QD, and the c-Met inhibitor INC280 25mg/kg QD (all p.o.). Although INC280 alone led to significant decrease in tumor growth, only the LGX818/ MEK162/ INC280 triple combination led to complete and sustained tumor regression in all mice. Further, we tested a second PDX model with a MET amplification (albeit broader and lower) but baseline pMET on the protein level. In this model, INC280 did not show any antitumor effect confirming the specificity for c-Met and the importance of validating genomic data.In summary, using our BRAF inhibitor resistant PDX model pipeline we were not only able to identify actionable alterations in all models, but also to test rational second line combination therapies in pre-clinical in vivo trials. Genomic data alone might not be sufficient to accurately predict therapy responses and protein arrays were a valuable tool to validate deleterious alteration calls. This study represents an important step towards improving personalized medicine in melanoma, and highlights the potential use of c-Met inhibitors in melanoma combination therapy in a defined subset of patients.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Statins may trigger apoptosis in tumour cells in vitro and, particularly, melanoma cells are susceptible to statin induced apoptosis. Lipophilic statins (e.g. Atorvastatin, Simvastatin) induce strong caspase 3 activation after 48h of treatment, whereas hydrophilic statins (e.g. Pravastatin, Rosuvastatin) do not trigger caspase activation. Recently, we demonstrated the presence of an autocrine amplification loop which increases apoptosis by a caspase 8 dependent pathway after treatment with lipophilic statins (Minichsdorfer and Hohenegger, Br J Ph 2009). It is known that activation of caspase 2 may prime melanoma cells for death receptor induced apoptosis, however, although an association between caspase 2 activation and RhoB upregulation was shown, the significance of this interaction is still not clear.Methods', ' We investigated the activity of caspase 2, 3 and 8 in A375 and 518A2 human metastatic melanoma cells after statin treatment in the presence and absence of a caspase 2 inhibitor (Z-VDVAD-FMK) or cycloheximide by cleavage of specific fluorescent caspase substrates. Upregulation of RhoB after statin treatment as well as the influence of the co-treatment with the isoprenoids farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) was studied by Western blot.Results', ' Exposure of these cells to simvastatin led to increased caspase 2 activation which is abrogated by co-application of the caspase 2 inhibitor Z-VDVAD-FMK. Moreover, treatment with Z-VDVAD-FMK also prevented caspase 8 and caspase 3 activation. We could show that production of an autocrine factor needs an intact translation machinery. Inhibition of translation by co-administration of cycloheximide prevented apoptotic morphological changes as well as caspase 3 and caspase 8 activation in A375 and 518A2 cells. Since caspase 2 may interact with RhoB, we also investigated the effect of statin treatment on RhoB expression and observed an upregulation of RhoB which was inhibited by the addition of cycloheximide in both cell lines. However, isoprenoids were not able to reverse RhoB upregulation or PARP cleavage in 518A2 cells.Conclusion', ' Overall, our data provide evidence for an important role of caspase 2 in statin induced apoptosis of 2 human metastatic melanoma cell lines. These findings may help to understand the function of caspase 2 in the induction of apoptosis. Moreover, we observed upregulation of RhoB following statin treatment in these cell lines.

CHO cells were transiently transfected to express mutant KIT or PDGFR constructs. Transfected cells were treated with a range of DCC-2618 and levels of phosphorylated KIT or PDGFR in cell lysates were determined by ELISA or western blot. Cell proliferation of several cell lines was measured using the fluorescent dye resazurin. Experiments were performed in triplicate. In vivo xenograft models were performed at Molecular Imaging, Inc.

DCC-2618 potently inhibited KIT activation in human GIST cell lines, including GIST T1 (exon 11 deletion, IC50 2 nM), GIST 430 (exon 11 deletion/exon 13 V654A, IC50 7 nM), and GIST 48 (exon 11 V560D/exon 17 D820A, IC50 53 nM). In the murine mastocytosis P815 cell line expressing the exon 17 D816Y mutation, DCC-2618 potently inhibited cell proliferation (IC50 2 nM).In vivo, DCC-2618 administration at 50 mg/kg afforded an ED90 for inhibition of KIT phosphorylation in the GIST T1 xenograft model, corresponding to an EC90 concentration of  470 ng/mL. When give twice daily, this oral dose resulted in almost complete tumor stasis.

        "Background":"['MITF, the master regulator of melanocytes, is a basic basic- helix- loop-helix- leucine zipper transcription factor that is essential for the development of melanocytes. MITF is also a lineage- survival oncogene in melanoma and recently, it has been shown that germline mutations in MITF predispose to this malignant disease. In melanoma, MITF has been proposed to act as a rheostat where high levels of MITF contribute to a proliferative phenotype whereas low levels result in a more invasive phenotype. The biological output generated by high or low levels of MITF is well characterized. However, how the activity of MITF is regulated to mediate these effects is less well known. It has been proposed that MITF is phosphorylated upon ligand induced activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase c- KIT. C-KIT engages the MAP kinase signaling cascade where ERK2 directly phosphorylates Ser73 of MITF and P90RSK phosphorylates the Ser409 residue of MITF. As a consequence, MITF activity increases and the protein is subjected to ubiquitin dependent degradation.Here, we show for the first time that c-KIT induces phosphorylation of MITF through the survival PI3 kinase- AKT pathway, the P38 stress pathway as well as the well-known MAP kinase-ERK signaling pathway. In addition, we show that the SRC kinase upstream of ERK is essential for c-KIT induced MITF activation. Moreover, we used several c-KIT phosphorylation site mutants to map the specific sites that are involved in the mediating transcription activation potential of MITF. These mutants also show less effects on MITF-mediated proliferation.We have generated phosphorylation specific antibodies against Ser73 and Ser409 of MITF and characterized the phosphorylation pattern of MITF using these reagents. Our results suggest that there is a particular relationship between Ser73 and Ser409 with subsequent effects on function. Based on our findings, we propose that phosphorylation of MITF might act as negative feedback mechanism that keeps MITF activity in check. Our model challenges the current knowledge of MITF modulation and provides insights that may have a profound impact on our understanding of the role of MITF in melanocyte and melanoma biology.']",

To study this at a genome-wide level in melanoma we analyzed the methylome of 44 cases of malignant melanoma. We saw widespread demethylation in melanoma occurring preferentially outside of CpG islands. Comparison of primary and metastatic lesions showed demethylation occurs early during carcinogenesis with few additional alterations in advanced tumors. The colony stimulating factor-1 receptor was aberrantly expressed and hypomethylated in nearly all cases. The expression of CSF1R was validated by IHC on primary tumors and by qPCR and Western blotting in BRAF mutant and WT cell lines. CSF1R can be aberrantly expressed via an upstream LTR element in Hodgkin’s lymphoma. After analyzing our patient samples and the cell lines, we have found this aberrant transcript may be the dominant form in melanoma as well. Expression of one of its ligands IL34 was also shown in the cell lines by both ELISA and qPCR pointing to a potential autocrine regulatory loop. The effects of a small molecule inhibitor, PLX3397 as well as shRNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor were investigated in 2D and 3D cell culture. We saw inhibition of cell growth, smaller colony size, increased apoptosis and decreased invasiveness - suggesting a functional role for CSF1R in melanoma. Treatment of melanoma with small molecule inhibitors of BRAF V600E is effective for a time, but resistance invariably develops. The feedback activation of EGFR, BRAF amplification, BRAF splice variants and others are known to aid in the acquisition of resistance and the rebound activation of the MAPK-pathway. We are suggesting a role for CSF1R in this process. In Western experiments, the rebound of phospho-ERK after BRAF inhibitor treatment was accelerated with the addition of CSF1R ligands, or delayed with PLX3397, also attenuating AKT phosphorylation. Melanoma cells stably expressing shRNA against CSF1R recapitulated the effects of the inhibitor. Assaying the cells at different time points during a long-term V600E inhibitory experiment, we saw increasing levels of the transcription factor RUNX1, followed by increasing levels of IL34 and of the receptor, as well as its maturation, evidenced by the appearance of the high MW form. Utilizing shRNA-mediated knockdown of RUNX1 resulted in lower levels of the CSF1R and IL34 transcripts and delayed the rebound. Analysis of primary RNA-Seq data showed an increase in RUNX1, CSF1R and IL34 expression in resistant tumors. Co-inhibition of CSF1R and BRAF was also tested and resulted in synergistic blockade of cell growth in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo. The CSF1R inhibitor, PLX3397 is currently in clinical trials for glioblastoma, prostate, breast cancers and other cancers.

In this study we evaluated the potential of a probe-based, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay to quantitatively measure copies of DNA encoding the mutant BRAFV600E and wild-type alleles in the plasma of patients undergoing treatment with a BRAF inhibitor. We previously showed this assay to be 100% specific with a sensitivity to detect 1 mutant copy among 10,000 wild-type copies when sufficient input DNA was used.Methods', ' Ten patients with BRAF-mutant stage IV melanoma were prospectively studied. At least 3 serially-collected plasma samples were available for each patient, corresponding to pre-treatment, best treatment response, and progression of disease as evidenced by PET/CT scan. DNA was extracted from plasma samples and concentrations were measured using a Qubit fluorometer. The relevant BRAF region was assayed using 24 to a maximum of 337 ng of DNA from each sample, using multiple replicate wells for dilute samples to maximize the probability of detecting BRAF mutant copies. Specific Taqman 5 hydrolysis probes for wild-type and mutant BRAF were employed along with common primers to measure the number of copies of each amplicon/reaction. The amount of amplifiable DNA was measured using RPP30 as a control gene.Results', ' All 10 patients had partial responses. We analyzed 35 plasma samples, of which 30 had a minimum of 4ml of plasma. Qubit-based DNA concentrations ranged from 6.9 to 1158 ng/ml. All samples yielded positive amplification of the BRAF and RPP30 amplicons. Total BRAF DNA concentrations ranged from 719 to 156,920 copies/ml plasma. Mutant BRAF DNA concentrations ranged from 0 to 13,028 copies/ml. The fraction of BRAFV600E amplicons ranged from 0 to 45%, with a minimal detected mutant fraction of 0.01%. In 8/10 patients, levels of mutant BRAF fell with clinical response and/or rose with disease progression. In 3 of these 8 patients, samples drawn 10 days to 2 months prior to imaging studies showed increased levels of BRAF mutant DNA prior to evidence of disease progression. In 1 of the remaining 2 patients levels of total BRAF DNA tracked with clinical outcome better than levels of mutant BRAF DNA. In 1/10 patients neither levels of mutant nor total BRAF DNA tracked with clinical responses.Conclusions', ' These results demonstrate that a ddPCR assay is able to quantitatively measure total and mutant BRAF DNA in the plasma of patients with stage IV melanoma. Levels of mutant and total BRAF DNA tracked with disease progression showing promise for this assay as a potential biomarker that may predict disease progression. Analyses of additional tumor-derived mutations in plasma DNA, and more precise assessments of disease response, are underway to determine optimal biomarkers to incorporate into melanoma clinical trial and patient care protocols.']",

Preliminary studies demonstrated fluorescently-labeled PNT100 in a SMARTICLE is delivered to the cell nucleus and that PNT2258 produces dramatic tumor regression in a diffuse large cell lymphoma xenograft, prolonging survival with a coincident decrease in bcl-2 protein. PNT2258 activity in the A375 melanoma model was assessed as a single agent or in combination in two separate studies. Study 1', ' PNT2258 alone, IV, 5 days/week for 3 weeks, to mice bearing A375 produced growth delays of 10.4, 7.8, and 7.8 days at 12.5, 8.3, and 5.6 mg/kg/dose, respectively.

Genomic DNA (gDNA) from fresh frozen tissue from 389 liver metastases and 6 primary tumors from 141 metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients as well as gDNA from 125 tumors from 75 malignant melanoma (MM) patients was available. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue from 285 of the CRC metastases from 123 patients were made. BRAF, exon 15 was amplified using the DyNazyme EXT polymerase system and sequenced by Sanger sequencing. IHC staining with the BRAF-VE1 antibody was performed on a Ventana BenchMark XT immunostainer. The intensity of staining was graded as 0 (no visible staining), grade 1 (weak diffuse background staining), 2 (moderate diffuse and granular) and 3 (strong granular staining). Grade 2 or 3 was regarded as positive. For high resolution melting analysis of V600-status, we used the LigthMix Kit BRAF V600E/K on a LightCycler 480 instrument.To establish the detection limits for the DNA-based methods used in this comparison, we analyzed a dilution series containing a ratio of 1', '1- 1', '107 BRAF V600E mutated DNA in BRAF wild-type DNA.

However, given the complexity of the up- and down-regulation of AKT and ERK pathways, it can be difficult to determine the state of each cell in a solid tumor section using single-marker staining methods. Tissue cytometry (or in situ cytometry) is a means of obtaining quantitative, per-cell, multi-marker antigen expression data from a tissue section. While determining the per-cell, multi-marker phenotype of samples containing whole cells has become a common, if not ubiquitous, part of flow cytometry and high-content screening, the same multi-marker analysis on samples such as solid tumors, bone or other solid tissues, which are not easily broken down into individual cells, are not easily performed. Immunohistochemical (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) methods have been developed for labeling such samples; however, in order to obtain quantitative multi-marker results from IHC and IF samples there are several challenges that must be overcome to give analogous tissue cytometry results. Methods', ' To address this, a tissue cytometry platform was developed that integrates', ' a) multiplexed immunofluorescence staining protocols; b) a multispectral imaging system (Vectra or Nuance) that to isolate IHC or IF marker signals from one another and, for IF, from tissue autofluorescence; and c) a new pattern-recognition-based image analysis package (inForm) for automatically performing morphologic segmentation and extracting data from cells-of-interest; and d) easy-to-use, optimized staining kits for panels of markers. For this study, a staining panel was developed targeting phosphoepitopes of AKT, ERK, and S6, using antibodies of three different isotypes, with secondaries conjugated to Alexa fluorophores (A488, A555, and A647). DAPI was used as a counterstain. Proof of principle of the suitability of the marker panel and imaging and analysis methods was done in cell lines, monitoring the down regulation of pS6 by a PI3 Kinase Inhibitor and the down regulation of pERK by a Raf inhibitor. Clinical samples pre- and post-case for treatment of a melanoma with a PIK3CA inhibitor were analyzed and both nuclear and cytoplasmic signal levels for all three markers obtained. Results', ' Results from cell lines matched expected down regulation. In the clinical samples, downregulation of pERK in melanoma was observed following treatment with the PLK3CA Kinase inhibitor. Conclusions', ' Tissue segmentation accuracy was estimated at greater than 90%, based on visual review by pathologists. Performance of the platform for automated multiplexed tissue cytometry analyses supports its application to routine clinical studies and works for both IHC and IF staining methodologies.

Several targeted therapies, such as imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib, bind to c-Kit and are approved for clinical use. However, due to their insufficient activity on cancers expressing wildtype c-Kit or insensitive forms of mutant c-Kit, the clinical response has been quite varied. Moreover, despite initial anti-cancer benefits in c-Kit mutant settings (such as in GIST), resistance to c-Kit inhibitor therapies emerges due primarily to the development of additional mutations in c-Kit.In an attempt to broaden the treatment of patients whose cancers express c-Kit (wildtype and mutant) and to enhance potency with comparable or better tolerability than the current therapeutics, we developed a c-Kit-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that disrupts tumor growth through anti-mitotic activity. Hybridomas from mice immunized with the c-Kit extracellular domain (ECD) were screened for selective c-Kit binding and degradation. A humanized lead antibody (Ab) was identified, which rapidly internalized upon binding cell-surface c-Kit, but did not block binding to the c-Kit ligand (SCF). The Ab exhibited minimal-to-no cytotoxicity against c-Kit+ cell lines in vitro. To generate cytotoxic activity and to potentially overcome resistance to current c-Kit-targeting therapies, the Ab was conjugated to the maytansinoid DM1, a powerful anti-tubulin agent, via a non-cleavable linker, SMCC (technology licensed from ImmunoGen, Inc.). The ADC demonstrated robust anti-proliferative activity against cell lines expressing mutant c-Kit (GIST) and wildtype c-Kit (SCLC, AML) in vitro. The ADC also demonstrated potent anti-cancer activity in GIST and SCLC tumor xenograft models in vivo.In summary, the anti-c-Kit ADC is highly selective and active against cancers with elevated c-Kit expression regardless of their mutational status, thus representing a promising novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of c-Kit+ solid tumors, such as GIST and SCLC, as well as hematological malignancies such as AML and aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM).']",

Based on shared oncogenic kinase mechanisms with CML, we hypothesized that combined inhibition of KIT and a novel Wnt/Ca++/Calcineurin/NFAT pathway would synergistically inhibit the proliferation of KIT mutant cells.Experimental methods', ' We sequentially combined four different calcineurin inhibitors with five different KIT inhibitors and measured cell proliferation and caspase 3/7activity in nine unique KIT mutant cell lines. Using the Chou and Talalay method we calculated combination indices to quantify drug-drug interactions. Changes in NFAT phosphorylation and localization in KIT mutant cells were assessed by immunoblotting. Finally, we measured NFAT transcriptional activity using an NFAT-responsive reporter cell line.Results', ' In contrast to other cellular models, NFAT appeared to be constitutively active and localized in the nucleus in many KIT mutant cell lines. We observed synergy when we combined a calcineurin inhibitor with a KIT inhibitor in all KIT mutant cell lines where NFAT was constitutively active. Combination index (CI) values for the different KIT mutant cell lines ranged from 0.3-0.5. To investigate whether NFAT was required for this synergy, we combined NFAT specific inhibitors with KIT inhibitors and found synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation. We created a KIT-mutant reporter cell line where NFAT binding drives the expression of luciferase. As expected, NFAT transcriptional activity decreased when our promoter-reporter cell line was treated with calcineurin inhibitors and increased with TPA and ionomycin treatment. Unexpectedly, we also found that KIT inhibitors decreased NFAT transcriptional activity in this cell model.Conclusions', ' These data indicate that combination therapy using a calcineurin phosphatase inhibitor and a KIT kinase inhibitor results in synergistic killing of KIT mutant cells. Additionally, the constitutive activation of NFAT in these cell lines indicate aberrant signaling in the Wnt/Ca2+/calcineurin/NFAT pathway, which has not been previously reported in KIT mutant cell lines. The observed synergy between NFAT inhibitors and KIT inhibitors suggests this effect is mediated by NFAT rather than other calcineurin targets. Finally, the fact that KIT inhibitors modulated NFAT transcriptional activity suggests crosstalk between KIT and NFAT signaling pathways.']",

        "Background":"['Uveal melanoma (UM) is an aggressive intraocular malignancy with high tendency to metastasize to the liver. The majority of UM harbor activating mutations in the G proteins Gnaq/11, and amplification of the oncogene c-Myc. Currently available drugs have shown limited response in patients with UM and there is an urgent need for new effective therapies. Recent findings from our laboratory demonstrated that UM cells with Gnaq/11 mutations are dependent on BRD4 activity. BET proteins are epigenetic readers involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. BRD4 inhibitors consist of small molecules that competitively displace BRD4 from acetylated histones, resulting in the suppression of the MYC transcriptome and other BRD4-dependent genes. Here, we report that a novel clinical BRD4 inhibitor from Plexxikon (Berkeley, CA), PLX51107, induces high cytotoxic activity in UM cell lines at nanomolar concentrations. In cells with Gnaq/11 mutations, PLX51107 showed an IC50 of 250nM, similar to the pre-clinical compound JQ1. In contrast, PLX51107 did not have a significant effect (IC50>3000nM) in cells without the mutations. PLX51107 induced marked apoptosis in Gnaq/11 mutant cells, as detected by Annexin V staining and induction of cleaved PARP. It also suppressed the expression of BRD4 targets, i.e c-Myc, Rad51, and induced the pro-apoptotic protein Bim. In mouse xenograft models of UM PLX51107 significantly inhibited tumor growth. Since the MAPK pathway plays a major role in UM, we explored the combination of PLX51107 with a MEK inhibitor, and found increased activity in vitro and in vivo. All together, these observations support the idea that this clinical BRD4 inhibitor represents a novel therapeutic intervention against UM with Gnaq/11 mutations, and clinical development is planned.']",

NK cell action is determined through binding of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) with specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I ligands on target cells.

The KIR locus has been primarily studied in the context of HCV, HIV, and transplant outcomes. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that KIR genotypes are associated with Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC) etiology. These are among the most prevalent malignancies worldwide with rising incidence. In addition, they are highly antigenic tumors, with a possible viral etiology, making NMSC an ideal model to test KIR as a cancer susceptibility trait.

A substitution of an aspartate for a valine at position 816 (D816V) is one of the most commonly found oncogenic c-Kit mutation and is found in more than 90% of cases of mastocytosis and in a subgroup of germ cell tumors, core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia and mucosal melanomas. Previous studies have shown that the D816V mutation causes a structural change in the activation loop resulting in weaker binding of the activation loop to the juxtamembrane domain, leading to a release of the negative constraint it poses on kinase activity. Here we have investigated the role of Y823 in the activation loop of c-Kit and its role in oncogenic transformation by c-Kit/D816V. Although dispensable for the kinase activity of c-Kit/D816V, the presence of Y823 was shown to be crucial for cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, mutation of Y823 selectively down-regulated the Ras/Erk and Akt pathways. It also led to decreased phosphorylation of STAT5 and reduced the transforming capacity of D816V/c-Kit in vitro. The sensitivity to kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib and nilotinib, was decreased in cells expressing c-Kit/Y823F/D816V compared to cells c-Kit/D816V. Mice injected with cells expressing c-Kit/D816V/Y823F displayed significantly reduced tumor size as well as tumor weight compared to controls. Finally, microarray array analysis, comparing c-Kit/Y823F/D816V cells with cells expressing c-Kit/D816V, demonstrate that mutation of Y823 causes up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes whereas genes of survival pathways are down-regulated.

Methods able to quantitatively measure differences in DNA methylation between normal and cancer cells provide promising sources for biomarker identification and assessment.Here we report on the use of a methylation assay (Zymo Research's OneStep qMethyl) and digital PCR counting (RainDrop dPCR) to enable quantitative measurements of DNA methylation at specific genomic loci using small amounts of non-bisulfite converted DNA. MGMT promoter methylation measurements are used to illustrate the method's robust quantification of small percent methylation changes using low amounts of input DNA.Zymo Research's OneStep qMethyl Kit is used for the detection of region-specific DNA methylation via the selective amplification of methylated cytosines after digestion with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. RainDance Technologies RainDrop dPCR system is a highly sensitive tool for precise quantification of nucleic acids using probe-based qPCR reagents. RainDrop offers unique analytical advantages for clinical diagnostics due to its exceptionally high sensitivity for absolute quantification and capability to multiplex assays, using a wide dynamic range of input DNA in a contamination-free and simple workflow. The combination of both technologies enables a novel, fast, and robust method for quantitative methylation analysis of small amounts of DNA.The DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) removes mutagenic alkyl adducts from DNA, and its epigenetic silencing by promoter methylation confers susceptibility to DNA-damaging alkylating agents in glioblastomas, melanomas, and lung cancer cell lines, and is increased in cancers including advanced gastric carcinomas, colorectal tumors, and triple-negative breast cancers. A sensitive, quick, and cost-effective quantitative method for assessing MGMT promoter methylation would greatly enhance the diagnostic potential for this candidate cancer biomarker.Here we show digital quantification of MGMT promoter methylation across the range from 0 to 100%, demonstrating a linear correlation that enables less than 15% methylation changes to be robustly measured using less than 20 nanograms of input DNA. This method provides a sensitive count of region-specific methylation percentages using an easy workflow.

        "Background":"['Background', '  Acquired resistance (AR) to BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) in melanoma is a near-universal phenomenon driven by numerous genetic and non-genetic alterations. Clinical implications of these AR mechanisms have not been described in a large cohort. We assessed the spectrum of BRAFi AR mechanisms and their associated timing of onset, pattern of disease progression (DP), and clinical outcomes.  Methods', '  We compiled clinical and genetic data from 100 patients (pts) with 132 melanoma samples obtained at BRAFi DP from three previously published studies of BRAFi resistance. Whole exome sequencing and/or PCR-based genetic testing were performed on all samples. Associations between AR mechanisms and clinical features/outcomes were assessed with multivariate logistic regression models.  Results', '  In 132 DP samples, putative AR mechanisms were identified in 58%, including NRAS or KRAS mutations (20%), BRAF splice variants (16%), BRAFV600E/K amplifications (13%), MEK1/2 mutations (7%), and non-MAPK pathway alterations (11%). Marked heterogeneity was observed within tumors and patients. BRAFV600E/K amplifications and non-MAPK alterations often co-occurred with other genetic changes, whereas NRAS mutations, MEK1/2 mutations, and BRAF splice variants largely arose in isolation (p = 0.02). Of 19 pts with  2 DP biopsies, identified AR mechanisms were concordant in only 1 pt (5%). NRAS mutations were associated with vemurafenib use (p = 0.045) and baseline intracranial metastases (p = 0.036). Progression-free survival and patterns of DP were similar across AR mechanisms. The median survival after DP was 6.9 months, and subsequent responses to combined BRAF/MEK inhibition were uncommon (2/15; 13%); no patients responded to ipilimumab (0/24). Post-progression outcomes did not correlate with specific BRAFi AR mechanisms.   Conclusions', '  This is the largest study of acquired BRAFi resistance in pts with BRAF mutant melanoma. Despite marked heterogeneity of AR mechanisms within pts and tumors, NRAS mutations were associated with vemurafenib use and intracranial disease. Further investigation into non-genetic AR mechanisms and immune features of BRAFi progression is warranted.']",

Ipilimumab activates cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and enables them to destroy tumor cells. However, the molecular determinants of response to ipilimumab are unknown.  Methods', '   Fresh frozen tumor DNA (and matching blood) from 25 melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab was subjected to whole exome sequencing.  Exon capture was performed using the SureSelect Human All Exon 50MB kit (Agilent). Enriched exome libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina) to a mean coverage of 103X.

Results', '   Our cohort included complete responders (CR) and nonresponders (NR). Mutational burden ranged from 1-1121 mutations per tumor.  Mutational load was significantly associated with clinical response (p=0.028, CR vs. NR, Fishers Exact Test), but alone was not sufficient to predict response. Using genome-wide somatic neoepitope analysis, we defined candidate tumor neoantigens and identified a neoantigen landscape that is specifically present in tumors with complete responses to ipilimumab.  These somatic neoepitopes share consensus sequences with experimentally validated antigens from a variety of pathogens.  Furthermore, in four of six CR patients, a mutation led to the generation of a consensus amino acid sequence previously identified as necessary for T-cell recognition of melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART-1).  Conclusions', '   Somatic mutations and concomitant generation of neoepitopes in melanoma tumors confers enhanced antigenicity and response to the immune checkpoint modulator ipilimumab. Our study defines the neoantigen landscape in responders to ipilimumab, provides a rationale for examining the exomes of patients for whom ipilimumab is being considered, and builds a foundation for understanding the molecular determinants of response to cancer immunotherapy.']",

Methods', ' After extraction, tumor DNA of 118 tumors (44 metastatic tumors, 46 SSM, 11 ALM, 5 nodular, 2 Dubreuilh and 3 spitzoid) and 73 nevi (50 benign nevi, 18 dysplastic nevi and 5 spitzoid nevi) were sequenced using a panel of 15 genes (ALK, BRAF, CDKN2A, CTNNB1, GNA11, GNAQ, KIT, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NRAS, RAC1, RAF1, SF3B1, TERT and TP53) on a new generation sequencer (PGM Ion Torrent) using chips 318 with a depth > 51000x .

Results', ' The results of the sequencing showed the presence of very large number of mutations. In the begnin nevi, excepting BRAF mutations (V600E and V600K, present in 86%) there were no other mutations. At the opposite, the percentage of mutations in many other genes (ALK, KIT,CDKN2A,TP53...) in MM tumors range from 55% (Breslow < 1mm) to 90% in metastatic tumors. More than 80% of mutations were transitions C > T reflecting the UV-induced mutagenesis. Interestingly, in 33% of atypical and Spitz nevi, we also found at least one mutation in one of these genes (40% of these mutations were reported in Cosmic databases). Comparison of the proportion of somatic mutations between the different types of nevi, tumors with low thickness and metastatic tumors clearly showed an accumulation of somatic mutations during tumor development. Conclusions', ' This chip dedicated to MM is interesting', ' high sensitivity, allowing a better tumor classification and rapid identification of therapeutic targets.

Therefore, mutations or deletions in this or in adjacent regions cause constitutive activation of these kinases as observed in 30% of AML patients for FLT3 and in 70% of adult GIST and a subset of melanoma patients for KIT.NMS-P088 is a member of a novel indazole sub-series, which selectively targets both FLT3 and KIT kinases, with different mutations, both primary and secondary, some of which involved in resistance to inhibitors clinically used to target these kinases, such as quizartinib for FLT3 and imatinib for KIT.The compound is able to arrest in vitro growth of human cell lines (AMLs and GISTs) which bear constitutively activated FLT3 or KIT, with IC50s in the low nanomolar range and with high selectivity towards cell lines, including AMLs, which are not dependent on these kinases. When tested against a panel of BA-F3 cells engineered to be driven by different FLT3 or KIT mutants, NMS-P088 compared favorably with reference compounds, both in vitro and in vivo. For example, comparative in vivo tumor inhibition values against BA-F3_FLT3-ITD(F691L) model were 85% for 15 mg/kg NMS-P088 vs. 14% for 40 mg/kg quizartinib.In vivo studies conducted on nude mice bearing the human MOLM-13 AML model revealed that repeated oral administration of NMS-P088 was able to significantly inhibit tumor growth and to increase survival time and that strong inhibition of FLT3 signaling is sustained for at least 48 h after a single treatment.Preclinical profiling of the compound showed a good oral bioavailability in all species, indicated a good therapeutic window in 7-day repeated toxicological studies in rat and in dog and excellent BBB penetration. The low myelotoxicity observed in exploratory toxicological studies suggests that NMS-P088 is potentially well-suited to combination with myelotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and this point is currently subject of preclinical evaluation. Furthermore, no adverse effects on cardiac parameters were observed in a canine telemetry study in which animals were exposed to Cmax levels several fold higher than those required for efficacy in the mouse.

        "Background":"['Targeted cancer therapies that block the growth and spread of cancer by interfering with specific onco-proteins are limited by signaling mechanisms that drive intrinsic and acquired resistance. In particular, the MAPK and the PI3K/AKT pathways have been found to both reduce response rates to these agents and to mediate the acquisition of resistance via mutations that activate both pathways. For example, two recently approved BRAFV600E inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, cause dramatic clinical responses in 50% of BRAFV600E + melanoma patients but universally become ineffective within 5-6 months as a result of genetic alterations that activate the MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, including amplifications in BRAFV600E, loss of PTEN, and activating mutations in NRAS and KRAS, MEK, AKT1/3, PIK3CA and PIK3CG. Several of these mutated signaling proteins stimulate glucose metabolism, required for survival and proliferation, in part by increasing the expression and activity of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFKFB3). For example, PFKFB3 transcription is induced by HIF-1 (which is increased by BRAFV600E, RAS and MEK), loss of PTEN, and PFKFB3 activity is stimulated by AKT via phosphorylation of serine 461. We postulated that PFKFB3 is an essential downstream target of targeted cancer therapies and that the multitude of mutations and amplifications in signaling pathways that cause resistance to these agents activate PFKFB3. In new studies, we demonstrate that BRAFV600E, estradiol and epidermal growth factor each regulate PFKFB3 expression in melanoma cells, breast cancer cells and NSCLC cells, respectively. Moreover, we find that simultaneous inhibition of these oncoproteins or their co-ligands (i.e. the estrogen and EGF receptors) and PFKFB3 using a novel PFKFB3 inhibitor currently in a phase 1 trial, PFK-158, causes a synergistic increase in apoptosis and cytotoxicity in vitro, suggesting that PFK-158 can overcome the intrinsic resistance to these agents. We then decided to determine if these significant synergies would translate in vivo by investigating them in the A375 and A2058 melanoma preclinical models, and in the MCF-7 ER-dependent breast model. For instance, we compared the anti-tumor effects in A375 melanoma xenograft-bearing mice of', ' (i) the BRAFV600E inhibitor vemurafenib; (ii) PFK-158; or (iii) the combination of vemurafenib and PFK-158. Although we observed significant tumor growth inhibition with both monotherapies (>80%), we only observed tumor regression with the combination therapy (>50%). Results in these different models will be presented. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the PFKFB3 inhibitor PFK-158 may be able to universally overcome resistance to targeted cancer therapies. Furthermore, we predict that phase 1/2 trials of PFK-158 in combination with targeted cancer agents will yield improvements in objective response rates as well as improvements in progression-free survival.']",

Birinapant (TL32711) is a bivalent Smac Mimetic that antagonizes multiple IAPs to promote efficient apoptosis and is currently in clinical trials as a single agent and in combination with multiple chemotherapeutics. However, to enrich for patient populations that will maximally benefit from each specific treatment regimen, it is critical to identify predictive biomarkers to achieve maximum response. Based on multiple individual studies, members of IAPs have been reported to be overexpressed in multiple cancers. Therefore, the main focus of this study was to evaluate DNA copy number alterations of different IAPs in a variety of cancer cell lines, and to evaluate their association with birinapant sensitivity. Our initial analysis of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database revealed that approximately 41% (397/972) of the cancer cell lines carried DNA amplification of different IAPs. Detailed analysis showed copy number amplification of ML-IAP in 214 cell lines (22%), cIAP1/2 in 85 cell lines (9%), NAIP (BIRC1) in 37 cell lines (4%), BIRC8 (ILP-2) in 39 cell lines (4%) and XIAP in 22 cell lines (2%). Tumor-type evaluation indicated that 50% pancreatic, 25% melanoma, 35% colorectal, 40% ovarian, and 7% AML cancer cell lines carried DNA amplification of different IAPs, indicating that IAPs are frequently amplified in cell lines of various cancer types. To understand the association of IAP amplification and birinapant sensitivity, we analyzed 94 cell lines present in the CCLE for birinapant sensitivity with or without TNF, and with or without TRAIL. Our analyses indicated that approximately 20% (19/94) of cancer cell lines were birinapant single-agent sensitive, and 80% (75/94) were single resistant cell lines. Furthermore, 50% (37/75) of the birinapant single resistant cell lines showed synergistic induction of apoptosis when birinapant was combined with either TNF or TRAIL (\"synergy-positive\"). Our analysis showed that the frequency of cIAP1/2 amplification in birinapant single-agent sensitive cell lines was 3-fold higher (4/19, 21%) than in single-agent resistant cancer cell lines (5/75, 7%). However, there was no difference in IAP gene amplification between birinapant \"synergy-positive\" and \"synergy-negative\" resistant cell lines. This lack of correlation with the synergistic response observed with the combination of birinapant plus either TNF or TRAIL implies the involvement of additional pathways that we are attempting to define.

It has been identified as an oncogenic driver in various malignancies and is currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic target. To date, MET exon 14 skipping by sequencing and MET amplification by FISH have been found to have potential clinical utility in predicting those patients who may derive benefit from MET-targeted therapy. However, little research has been conducted on alternative technologies to FISH such as CISH, which does not require a dark room and can be interpreted by a board-certified pathologist. The purpose of this study is to report our experience with MET amplification across solid tumors using CISH.A retrospective analysis was done on 26,619 specimens analyzed for MET amplification by CISH at a CLIA-certified lab (Caris Life Sciences). The validated CISH assay, previously validated against a FISH assay, utilized a gene copy number > 5 to assess amplification. Concordance and correlative studies were done in MET-amplified, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens analyzed using a cMET IHC (SP44, 2+ or 3+ staining intensity in 50% or more tumor cell membrane) analyzing protein expression. Correlative studies involving co-existing aberrations, including PD-L1 (SP142, any intensity in at least 50% of tumor cells), in this MET-amplified, NSCLC cohort were also performed.MET amplification utilizing CISH was 0.7% (188/26,619) overall. MET-amplified solid tumors included carcinomas such as NSCLC (3.1%, 87/2767), gastric adenocarcinoma (3.8%, 11/293), esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (3.3%, 11/338), and endometrial carcinoma (0.4%, 9/2020) along with non-carcinomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (1.0%, 5/510), uterine sarcoma (1.3%, 5/400), melanoma (0.4%, 2/538), and rare tumors such as placental-site trophoblastic tumor (100%, 1/1) and prostatic neuroendocrine tumor (100%, 1/1). A sub-analysis of MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens demonstrated co-occurring protein overexpression in 92.6% (75/81) of cases. These same MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens were found to have EGFR pathogenic/presumed pathogenic mutations (19.7%, 15/76), ALK rearrangements (2.5%, 2/80), and PD-L1 overexpression (27.5%, 14/51). ROS1 rearrangements were not detected in this NSCLC cohort (0%, 0/76).Our data suggest MET amplification detection utilizing CISH is a viable option for identifying MET-driven cancers. The presence of MET across various solid tumors contrasts with biomarkers like HER2, which are exclusive to carcinomas. A sub-analysis of our NSCLC population shows MET-amplified tumors contains a similar molecular distribution to the general NSCLC population. Future studies should incorporate MET CISH in clinical trials utilizing MET-targeted agents to determine its potential as a predictive test for evaluating who may derive the most benefit.']",

In 119 melanoma tumor samples, 45% had BRAF mutations, 24% NRAS mutations, and 24% without either (designated WT), CNVs were evaluated in an initial set of 26 genes known to be involved in melanoma pathogenesis. Overall genomic instability, as measured by number of genes with CNVs, was associated with poor ECOG performance status (P=0.007) and marginally significant for more organs with metastatic involvement (P=0.06), and is consistent with other studies suggesting that genomic instability is a predictor of worsened outcome. We further explored the association between copy number and somatic mutation status. Not surprisingly, BRAF gene amplification was observed in 91% of BRAF mutant melanoma tumor samples (P<0.001, as compared to 66% of NRAS/WT samples).

The average value of MET copy number was also higher in BRAF V600K mutant compared to BRAF V600E mutant melanoma (0.53 v 0.27, P=0.04), which may contribute to the differing clinical behaviors of melanomas with the two mutations. Patients with BRAF copy number gain had a trend towards lower overall response rate to either treatment compared to diploid (15.2% v 29.6%, OR=0.37, P=0.08).

Less than 10 ng DNA input may result in allele drop out for low level mutations due to the inefficient amplification of multiplex PCR compared with PCR methods using a short length single amplicon. Higher DNA input to rescue allele drop-out is under evaluation.']",

        "Background":"['The fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) play a key role during development and in adult function. FGFRs belong to a family of receptor tyrosine kinases which are single-pass transmembrane receptors with extracellular ligand binding domains and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Upon binding of the ligand the kinase domain activates intracellular signaling networks that coordinate cellular processes such as proliferation, growth, differentiation, migration and survival. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a family of 18 ligands which are able to bind and activate distinct FGFRs. Deregulated FGFR activity, through mutations or translocations, is often associated with oncogenic events. Overexpression of FGFR or FGF may lead to increased cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, migration or survival, thus making it an interesting target.In this study we optimized a TaqMan qRT-PCR-based approach to evaluate the copy number variation for several FGFRs (FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4) and several FGF ligands (FGF1, FGF2, FGF3, FGF4, FGF10, FGF12, and FGF19) on a panel of 23 cell lines. The cell types covered a variety of diseases including bladder, breast, endometrial, gastric, kidney, liver, lymphoma, melanoma, sarcoma, small cell lung carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. These cell lines had been tested for sensitivity to the JNJ FGFR small molecule inhibitor JNJ42541707 which is a pan-FGFR inhibitor. We observed in the sensitive (IC50<100nm) and moderately sensitive (IC50 100 nM - 1000 nM) cell lines a co-amplification of FGF receptor and ligand. Two of the most sensitive cell lines to FGFR inhibitor treatments had the greatest amplification of FGFR2 with a copy number value greater than 100. This finding that co-amplification occurs in receptor and ligand offers a new potential biomarker for patients that may be sensitive to small molecule FGFR inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['BackgroundCancer therapy is challenged by diverse molecular implementations of oncogenic processes and by variations in therapeutic responses. So far, whole genome sequencing (WGS) and whole exome sequencing (WES) has been implemented in both research and clinical settings to identify oncogenic events in cancer genomes. However, a large number of passenger mutations have been identified and true driver mutations have been disguised. Distinguishing driver events from passenger events will be a key challenge for the realization of targeted therapy. To elucidate driver mutations that are clinically actionable, the Institute for Personalized Cancer Therapy at MD Anderson cancer center has developed a NGS clinical sequencing platform, T200, to sequence 202 cancer-related genes at high depth in thousands of cancer patients at MD Anderson.Materials and MethodsThe T200 mutation data, including single nucleotide variants (SNV, variant allele frequency >=1%) and copy number variations (CNV), of more than 500 cancer patients treated in MD Anderson Cancer Center were utilized in our study.Results1. By analyzing the SNV data, we identified several sets of co-occurring genes across all cancers. Some sets such as KRAS/APC/SMAD4 contain driver genes from multiple signaling pathways, which may indicate essential mechanisms for tumor development and nominate targets for combinational therapy.2. We elucidated mutual-exclusive mutations that were from genes in the same or different pathways. Several sets of well-known mutual-exclusive SNVs were verified in our analysis such as BRAF/NRAS SNVs in melanoma. We also illustrated novel sets of mutual-exclusive mutational events, such as IDH1/PTEN/PPP1R3A SNVs in brain tumors and EGFR/FGFR3/GNAS/NOTCH4 CNVs in all cancers.3. SNVs of more than 10 genes were enriched in specific cancer types, such as IDH1 and NF1 in brain tumor, BRAF and MITF in melanoma. CNVs of more than 50 genes were found enriched in one cancer type, such as PDGFRA amplifications in brain tumors and IL6R amplifications in breast cancer. We observed not only expected cancer specific mutations such as BRAF SNVs but also novel mutations such as NF1 SNVs and PDGFRA amplifications.4. We performed mutual-exclusivity and cancer type enrichment analysis on SNV hotspots. More than 20 SNV hotspots were elucidated, such as BRAF(V600E) in melanoma, IDH1(R132H) in brain tumors, KRAS(G12D) in colorectal cancer, and PIK3CA(H1047L) in breast cancer. In addition, multiple SNV hotspots were found to occur mutual-exclusively, such as BRAF(V600E)/IDH1(R132H)/MPL(L532V) in brain tumors.ConclusionDeep target sequencing enables us to systematically determine the potential driver mutation events (including low allele frequency SNVs), which not only help us characterize the landscape of cancer genomic alterations, but also provide comprehensive patient molecular profile to facilitate clinical decision-making and novel clinical trial design.']",

Variants are annotated for actionability by Oncomine Knowledgebase. Here we report an analytical validation of OFA.Methods', ' DNA and RNA, extracted from the FFPE processed GM12878, was used as the negative control to evaluate the specificity of OFA. A RNA sample containing multiple oncogenic gene fusions and a DNA sample containing multiple hotspot SNV and indels were used as the positive controls. Fresh DNA from cancer cell lines (HCC1143 or NCI-H2122) along with DNA from matched normal cell lines, HorizonDx NGS standards TruQ-1, TruQ-2, several engineered FFPE samples with gene fusions or copy number changes, and 43 clinical FFPE samples of a variety of solid tumor types (non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma) were used to evaluate the OFA performance. The analysis of the sequencing data was primarily performed with the OFA pipeline integrated with the Oncomine Knowledgebase. Only the genetic alterations with clinical utility were selected as the final output from the data pipeline. The SBS and indels detected by OFA were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Any CNVs detected were confirmed by FISH, if possible, and detected fusions were confirmed by RT-PCR or FISH.Results', ' No clinically relevant genetic alterations were detected from the negative control FFPE-GM12878, indicating the high specificity of the OFA.

The assay can detectgene fusion RNA present as 0.1%-1% of the total RNA, and gene amplifications are detected with a minimum of 50% tumor cell content. A known 12X CCND1 amplifications in HCC1143 and a 13X MYC amplification in NCI-H2122 were detected. In addition, a 13X EGFR amplification and 11X CDK4 amplification were detected in a lung cancer FFPE sample and confirmed by FISH.

        "Background":"['BackgroundThe most common activating B-raf mutations (T1799A point mutation) lead to a substitution of valine (V) to glutamic acid (E) at the position 600 of the amino acid sequence. This oncogenic mutation in the B-raf gene constitutively activates the MAPK signaling pathway which results in increased proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. B-raf V600E mutation was described in approximately 8% of all solid tumors (43% melanomas, 39-67% papillary thyroid carcinomas and 12% colorectal adenocarcinomas). Currently, the gold standard to identify B-raf mutations is sequencing of the tumor DNA. However this method is not practical for routine clinical detection due high risk of contamination and low sensitivity. Recent development of therapeutic intervention using B-raf inhibitors requires an accurate and rapid detection system for B-raf mutations.MethodsHere we developed a new methodology for the rapid and reliable detection of B-raf (V600) mutations by combination of the modified real-time PCR primers, peptide nucleic acid (PNA) clamping and MGB probe, named of PM-PCR method. In this assay, the mutant gene is selectively amplified by the modified PCR primers and the amplicon extending signals are collected by the taqman-MGB probe in a real-time fashion, while the amplification of wild-type B-raf DNA is completely blocked by the specifically designed PNA with a higher annealing temperature. The assay procedure includes only one step of sample loading to avoid potential contamination. The PM-PCR method can detect 3-10 copies of the mutant gene stably in somatic cells with background of a total of 10ng wild-type genomic DNA.Tumor samples from 97 patients with malignant melanoma (N=20) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (N=78) were evaluated for the B-raf V600mutation. Genomic DNA was extracted from FFPE tissue sections and analyzed by PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing for comparison.ResultsAmong the 97 tested samples, 74% (72/97) of them were positive for B-raf V600 mutation detected by our ARMS-PM assay, while 60.8% (59/97) were detected positive by Sanger sequencing. All the 25 negative cases detected by our assay were confirmed by Sanger sequencing with a concordance rate 100% (25/25). The overall concordance between our assay and Sanger sequencing was (87%) .ConclusionWe have developed a new method for detection of B-raf V600 mutation by combination of the modified real-time PCR primers, PNA and MGB probes (PM-PCR method).

        "Background":"['The elucidation of core networks driving tumorigenesis is greatly enhanced by studying tumors from multiple species. A comparison of tumors between evolutionarily distant organisms such as humans and fish offers a particularly powerful method to identify such core functionalities. In the past several years, the zebrafish has emerged as an important vertebrate model of cancer because it develops tumors that are histologically and functionally similar to the human disease. Overexpression of the BRAFV600E oncogene under the melanocyte-specific mitf promoter leads to a 100% penetrant melanoma in the context of p53 loss of function. We have previously shown that these zebrafish tumors exhibit characteristics of neural crest progenitors, rather than differentiated melanocytes, similar to many human melanomas which also overexpress the neural crest markers sox10 and ednrb. To identify the genomic lesions that are common to both species, we are performing RNA and DNA-sequencing of the zebrafish tumors and comparing them to human melanoma resequencing samples to identify common driver events. To facilitate this, we have developed technologies for both short and long term culture of zebrafish melanoma cell lines, along with normal tissue from each individual animal. One such melanoma line, ZMEL1, has been comprehensively characterized. RNA-seq demonstrated upregulation of neural crest genes such as ednrb, and pathway analysis indicated enrichment for ERK/MAP kinase and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, and these tumors are sensitive to inhibition by the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on tumor cell line and matched normal tissue to a depth of 39X coverage on the Illumina platform. A total of 5193 single basepair mutations were identified, of which 2% were found in the coding region, 41% in intronic regions and 56% in the intergenic DNA. Within the coding region, 25% were G>C and 18% T>C substitutions, with approximately equal number of non-synonymous to silent mutations. Coding mutations in several genes such as rps6kb1b and plb1 are of particular interest because of their reported mutation in human cancer as well. 35 regions of copy number changes were found, comprising over 600 genes, and these include amplification of known oncogenes such as SETDB1. Functional analysis of the genomic changes common to both zebrafish and human tumors is now being undertaken using in vitro and in vivo melanoma models. In summary, comparative oncogenomics between zebrafish and human melanoma provides a powerful method for filtering the vast number of changes down to a list of manageable, testable hypotheses. This method can be broadly applied to other tumors types.Citation Format', ' Richard M. White, Erin Langdon, Charles Kaufman, Ellen van Rooijen, Jennifer Yen, Peter Van Loo, Leonard Zon.

MYCN amplification and its over-expression are associated with the worst neuroblastoma disease outcome. Meta-iodo-benzylguanidine (MIBG) is a norepinephrine analogue and a mitochondrial respiration inhibitor. 131I-MIBG has been used for scintigraphic detection of neural crest derived tumors (neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma and melanoma) that specifically uptake MIBG by norepinephrine transporters (NET). 131I-MIBG is also used for targeted radiotherapy of neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma. Non-radiolabeled MIBG had been reported to be cytotoxic to neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism of its growth suppressive effect was not elucidated. Our previous studies showed that FCCP, a well-known mitochondrial respiration inhibitor, destabilized MYCN and MYC in neuroblastoma cells and caused growth suppression. In this study we confirmed that MIBG suppressed growth of neuroblastoma cell lines (SKNBE(2)C, IMR5, Nb69, and SKNAS), and its growth suppressive effect in each cell line correlated with NET expression in these cells. In addition, MIBG suppressed growth of neuroblastoma stem cells derived from SKNBE(2)C. MIBG treatment of SKNBE(2)C and SKNAS resulted in an increase expression of growth suppressive gene (GADD45B) and genes encoding for biomarkers of favorable neuroblastoma (CD44, EPHB6, EFNB2, EFNB3, NTRK1). Treatment of MYCN amplified (SKNBE(2)C, IMR5) and non-MYCN amplified (Nb69, SKNAS) neuroblastoma cells with MIBG resulted in marked reduction of MYCN and MYC expression, respectively in dose and time dependent fashions. Collectively, our studies suggest that MIBG not only targets neural crest derived tumors, but also is a MYCN/MYC destabilizing agent.']",

ETS variant 1 (ETV1) is an ETS factor gene that undergoes chromosomal translocation in prostate cancers and Ewing's sarcomas, amplification in melanomas, and lineage dysregulation in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Pharmacologic perturbation of ETV1 would be appealing in these cancers; however, oncogenic transcription factors are often deemed undruggable by conventional methods. Here, we used small-molecule microarray (SMM) screens to identify and characterize drug-like compounds that modulate the biological function of ETV1. We identified the 1,3,5-triazine small molecule BRD32048 as a top candidate ETV1 perturbagen. BRD32048 binds ETV1 directly, modulating both ETV1-mediated transcriptional activity and invasion of ETV1-driven cancer cells. Moreover, BRD32048 inhibits p300-dependent acetylation of ETV1, thereby promoting its degradation. These results point to a new avenue for pharmacological ETV1 inhibition and may inform a general means to discover small molecule perturbagens of transcription factor oncoproteins.Note\", ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

Despite the remarkable clinical activities achieved by vemurafenib and dabrafenib in treating B-RAFV600E metastatic melanoma, their clinical efficacy in B-RAFV600E CRC is far less impressive. Prior studies suggested that feedback activation of EGFR and MAPK signaling upon B-RAF inhibition contributed to the intrinsic resistance of CRC to the first generation B-RAF inhibitors. This report represents the first characterization of a dual RAF kinase/EGFR inhibitor, BGB-283, which is currently under clinical investigations. BGB-283 is a potent and selective pan-RAF and EGFR inhibitor with IC50 ranging from 5 to 47 nM on RAF and EGFR kinases. In vitro, BGB-283 potently inhibits B-RAFV600E-activated ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation. It demonstrates selective cytotoxicity and preferentially inhibits proliferation of cancer cells harbouring B-RAFV600E and EGFR mutation/amplification. In B-RAFV600E CRC cell lines, BGB-283 effectively inhibits the reactivation of EGFR and achieved sustained inhibition of MAPK pathway. In vivo, BGB-283 is highly efficacious in inhibiting tumor growth accompanied by partial and complete tumor regressions in both BRAFV600E mutant cell derived CRC xenograft models, including HT29, Colo205, WiDr, as well as two primary human CRC xenograft models. In particular, BGB-283 shows compelling efficacy and potent inhibition of EGFR/MAPK signaling in WiDr xenograft model where EGFR reactivation occurs upon B-RAF inhibition.

Isolation of NCCs from E9.5 mouse embryos resulted in a population that was 90% positive for the NCC markers p75, Sox10, and Ascl1, suggesting a highly enriched population.Next, we tested the ability of N-Myc infected NCCs to form tumors in vivo. In pilot experiments using NCCs with compromised p53, we obtained subcutaneous tumors following injection of NCCs in nude mice. Resulting tumors were diffusely positive for neuronal markers such as synaptophysin, MAP2, and Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Tumors also contained focal areas of divergent differentiation characteristic of melanoma, Schwannoma, and osteosarcoma, all cancers that can arise from NCC lineages. To our knowledge, this is the first report of cancer from transformed primary neural crest cells.To more closely model NBL genetics, we replaced loss of p53 with shRNA to knockdown CHD5 and ARID1A prior to N-Myc infection. Injection of the resulting NCCs also resulted in tumor formation in nude mice. Tumors were uniformly positive for neuronal markers including TH and Ascl1, as well as Phox2B, a marker of undifferentiated NBL, and with no evidence of other cancers.

To emphasise depth of knowledge on known cancer genes, mutation information is curated manually from the scientific literature, allowing very precise definitions of disease types and clinically relevant patient details. Combination of over 20,000 published studies gives substantial resolution of how mutations and phenotypes relate in human cancer, providing insights into the stratification of populations and new diseases behind known biomarkers. Conversely, our curation of over 15,000 cancer genome studies emphasises knowledge breadth, driving discovery of new unrecognised cancer-driving hotspots and molecular targets. Our high-resolution curation approach is globally unique, giving substantial insight into molecular biomarkers in human oncology. For example, BRAF is well characterized in skin melanoma, transiently treatable with inhibitors such as Vemurafenib. It is also well known in colorectal cancer, which is largely non-responsive to BRAF inhibitors. COSMIC's unique approach demonstrates the impact of BRAF mutations in much less well-known cancers, for instance, Hairy Cell Leukaemia (89% of samples mutated) and Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (49%), both of which respond remarkably well to BRAF inhibitors. Converse to skin melanoma, our curations suggest BRAF has a minimal role in Uveal melanoma (6% of Uveal tumors mutated for BRAF), with higher mutation rates in other genes (particularly GNA11, BAP1 and GNAQ), suggesting different mechanisms behind this disease.In addition to describing over two million coding point mutations across cancer, COSMIC also details more than six million non-coding mutations, 10,567 gene fusions, 61,232 genome rearrangements, 702,652 abnormal copy number segments, and more than 6 million abnormal expression variants. All these types of somatic mutation are annotated to both the human genome and each affected coding gene, then correlated across disease and mutation types. As increasing amounts of genetic data are gathered into COSMIC across human cancer, our annotations are beginning to emphasise events with a higher impact in cancer, highlighting the more functional coding mutations and major amplifications and deletions.

CDX-1401, a fully human monoclonal antibody linked to full length NY-ESO-1, binds to dendritic cell (DC) receptor DEC-205 to stimulate NY-ESO-1 specific CD4 and CD8 responses. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays were developed to determine NY-ESO-1 expression in human tumors and normal adjacent tissues (NAT). A qRT-PCR assay for the detection of LAGE-1, a cancer testis antigen with significant DNA homology to NY-ESO-1, was also developed but no commercially specific antibody was available for IHC.Methods', ' Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumors and NAT were procured from a commercial source or obtained from Mosaic Laboratories; split anonymized samples were analyzed for NY-ESO-1 by IHC at Mosaic and for NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1 by qRT-PCR at MolecularMD (OR) under IRB-approved protocols allowing in vitro analysis of remnant human samples. The study included', ' 18 each melanoma and ovarian cancers; 13 each colorectal (CRC), head & neck (H&N), and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC); and 38 NAT. HT1080 fibrosarcoma and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines (ATCC, VA) and normal testis were used as controls. The qRT-PCR assays were validated using in vitro transcribed RNA on NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1 kits provided by Life Technologies and the NY-ESO-1 IHC was developed using a mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma, MO).Results', ' The NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1 qRT-PCR assays had a linear range of 100-1,000,000 copies/reaction with limit of detection between 1-10 copies. An excess of LAGE-1 copies did not impact the specificity of the NY-ESO-1 assay and vice-versa. NY-ESO-1 protein was detected by IHC and NY-ESO-1 transcripts and LAGE-1 transcripts were detected in 9 (12%), 12 (16%) and 16 (21.3%), respectively, of the 75 tumor tissues while only 2 of the 38 normal samples were positive for LAGE-1. When stromal staining was considered in addition to epithelial staining, 16 (21.3%) tumor samples were positive by IHC. NY-ESO-1 protein was more prevalent in NSCLC (38%), ovarian cancer (11%) and melanoma (11%) vs. other tumor types. Positive staining by IHC was achieved in tumor tissues shown positive for NY-ESO-1 and negative for LAGE-1 transcripts. In general, tumor tissues obtained from Mosaic were of better quality, as assessed by the pathologist, and more positive than commercially procured samples.Conclusions', ' Two qRT-PCR assays were developed to specifically quantify NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1 mRNA without cross reaction. The antibody used in IHC assay seemed specific to NY-ESO-1. Inadequate sample quality impacted target prevalence. Implementing these assays in clinical trials may aid in prospectively identifying patients with NY-ESO-1 positive malignancies who could derive benefit from investigational NY-ESO-1 vaccines designed to induce anti-tumor immunity, such as CDX-1401.']",

Additionally, cfDNA and FFPE samples are typically limited in the amount of material that can be obtained, and often the FFPE samples are highly degraded, compounding the ability to sequence them and to perform accurate variant calling. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a single tube, multiplexed amplicon sequencing technology that employ hundreds of primer pairs for amplification of targeted loci, producing ready-to-run libraries for Illumina sequencing platforms. The resulting amplicons are less than 150 bp in length, enabling amplification and sensitive detection of mutations from cfDNA-sized DNA fragments or highly damaged DNA. A 200+ amplicon panel across 55 genes was developed to target known clinically relevant oncological mutations. The panel design encompasses single exons (e.g. BRAF) as well as comprehensive exon coverage of entire genes (e.g. TP53).DNA was extracted from FFPE, and cfDNA was extracted from fresh plasma. DNA was quantified by qPCR using 2 primer pairs targeting ALU repeat regions. 10ng of DNA input was used to perform the multiplexed PCR. Libraries were quantified by qPCR and sequenced with MiSEQ V2 reagents, paired end reads. Alignment was performed using Burrows-wheeler Aligner (BWA) and variant calling was performed with at least two validated publicly available tools and confirmed manually by IGV. A variety of tools were used to validate allele technology was used to validate the sequencing data.We interrogated 80 FFPE samples using our amplicon technology.The percent of on-target bases was over 95% and the coverage uniformity was over 98%, where uniformity is the percent based covered over 20% of the mean coverage. Out of the 40 colorectal cancer samples tested, 17 showed mutations in KRAS. Out of the 20 melanoma samples (Cure line) also analyzed, 9 were positive for BRAF V600E. The presence of those mutations was confirmed using myTprimerTM KRAS and BRAF qPCR assay. The limit of detection of the assay was set at 3% due to the inherent noise caused by the damage from the FFPE samples. For cell lines with known mutations, the sensitivity was 0.5%. No false positive or false negative were reported. 20 FFPE samples from different cancer types were also assessed. Mutations were identified in ERBB2 (cervical cancer), ALK (lung cancer) and TP53 (colon cancer) genes, as well as MET amplification (lung cancer).Cell free DNA provides a non-invasive tool to monitor cancer progression and treatment efficacy. Tumor DNA, matching blood DNA and cfDNA from 10 cancer patients will be subjected to our multiplex PCR oncology panel.

We and others have recently reported that AIP1 functions as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer models. However, the role of AIP1 in regulating tumor microenvironment and metastatic niche is not known. In the present study, we implanted tumor cells with the same genetic background into C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and AIP1-deficient (AIP1-KO) mice to address this question. In subcutaneous (SQ) allograft models using B16 melanoma and LLC Lewis lung carcinoma, tumor growth and metastasis to multiple organs including lymph node, lung, liver, spleen and bone marrow were significantly enhanced in AIP1-KO host, suggesting AIP1 in tumor microenvironment limits tumor metastases. However, a direct intravenously injection of tumor cells resulted in no differences in tumor metastasis between WT and AIP1-KO mice, indicating AIP1 in host regulates tumor metastasis at steps prior to extravasation to target tissues. We examined effects of AIP1 deletion on the induction of local inflammation, tumor cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), generation of metastatic routes (formation of new blood and lymphatic vessels) and establishment of pre-metastatic niche in distance tissues. SQ tumors in AIP1-KO host showed more profound increases in macrophage infiltration, tumor cell EMT, intratumoral angiogenesis and peri-tumoral lymphangiogenesis as well as lymphangiogenesis in lymph nodes prior to the detection of metastatic tumor cells. Finally, SQ tumor induced an establishment of pre-metastatic niche in lung as indicated by increased immunostaining for fibronectin and accumulation of VEGFR1, c-Kit and CXCR-positive cells which were augmented in AIP1-KO mice. Importantly, WT recipient with AIP1-KO bone marrow-derived cells showed similar phenotype to AIP1-KO mice in tumor growth and metastasis.

        "Background":"['We have been interested in identifying MYCN/MYC destabilizers that can specifically target neural crest derived tumors (neuroblastoma, melanoma, and malignant pheochromocytoma). MYCN amplification and its over-expression are associated with the worst neuroblastoma disease outcome. Non-MYCN amplified neuroblastomas express high-levels of MYC, and prognosis of these neuroblastomas is very poor. Melanoma and malignant pheochromocytoma are also known for high MYC expression. Interestingly, these neural crest derived tumors characteristically express the norepinephrine transporter (NET). This feature can be used to specifically target the tumor cells with agonists of NET, such as Meta-Iodo-BenzylGuanidine (MIBG). In the previous AACR meeting, we presented our finding that non-radio-labeled MIBG can suppress growth of neuroblastoma cells in vitro, and this effect is in part related to its ability to destabilize MYC and MYCN. We have also shown that FCCP, a well-known mitochondrial respiration inhibitor, destabilized MYCN and MYC in neuroblastoma cells and caused growth suppression. Recently, it has been reported that Phenformin, a Type II diabetic drug, binds NET, suggesting that NET positive cells preferentially uptake Phenformin. It is also known that Phenformin inhibits the mitochondrial electron transfer system. In this study, we have investigated a possible effect of Phenformin on growth and MYC/MYCN stability in neuroblastoma cells in vitro. SKNBE(2)C and CHP134 neuroblastoma cell lines were treated with various doses (0-2.5mM) of Phenformin for two days. MTS assay was used to assess the effect of Phenformin on growth of the cells. There was a dose-dependent growth suppression of the NB cell lines tested. Phenformin was more effective against growth of SKNBE(2)C than CHP134 cells. The effect of Phenformin on MYC/MYCN expression in four neuroblastoma cell lines [SKNBE(2)C, CHP134, SKNAS, and SY5Y] was also examined by Western blot assay. SKNBE(2)C and CHP134 express MYCN, whereas SKNAS and SY5Y express MYC at high levels. Treatment of these cells with Phenformin at the dose of 1mM for 24 hours resulted in destabilization of MYCN/MYC, suggesting that the growth suppressive effect of Phenformin on neuroblastoma cells was in part due to reduction in MYC/MYCN expression. We are currently examining whether the above observations made in neuroblastoma are also applicable to other neural crest derived tumors. In addition, we are investigating how Phenformin-related mitochondrial dysfunction causes destabilization of MYC/MYCN in neuroblastoma cells.']",

Mutation testing of plasma exoNA from all 43 patients detected 39 (95%) of 41 mutations present in tumor tissue with 100% specificity. Mutation testing of plasma cfDNA from 39 patients using ddPCR detected 33 (89%) of 37 mutations present in tumor and testing of plasma cfDNA from 37 patients using BEAMing detected 34 (97%) of 35 mutations present in tumor tissue; however, both cfDNA methods reported an additional KRAS mutation not present in tumor tissue. Patients with high mutation allele frequency (MAF, > median) had shorter median survival compared to patients with low MAF ( < median) when using exoNA (5.9 vs. 11.8 months, P= 0.006), but not cfDNA ddPCR (6.0 vs. 7.4 months, P= 0.06) or cfDNA BEAMing (6.5 vs. 7.4 month, P= 0.07).

        "Background":"['Tumor invasiveness and therapeutic resistance strongly contribute to the low (<10%) five-year survival rate for advanced stage lung cancer; thus, identification of novel interventions targeting metastasis and therapeutic resistance is a necessity. Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met) and fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) are two cell surface receptors known to be associated with lung cancer invasiveness and cell survival. Our lab recently demonstrated that Fn14 was over-expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), correlated with activated epidermal growth factor receptor, and that expression of Fn14 modulated NSCLC cell invasiveness and metastasis. We hypothesize that elevated Fn14 expression can be maintained by c-Met activation, and that blockade of Fn14 can suppress NSCLC invasiveness driven by c-Met. Here we demonstrate that Fn14 protein expression significantly correlated with c-Met expression in primary NSCLC patient tumors. Fn14 and c-Met were more highly expressed in metastatic tumors compared to patient-matched primary NSCLC tumors, suggesting a role in the metastatic phenotype. To further elucidate the relationship between Fn14 and c-Met in NSCLC invasiveness, we employed two cell lines derived from a primary tumor (H2073) and metastatic lymph node (H1993) of the same patient. H1993 cells (c-Met receptor amplification) expressed significantly elevated protein levels of Fn14 compared to H2073 (low c-Met), which were significantly diminished in H1993 cells upon c-Met inhibition through SU11274 treatment. Moreover, exposure of H2073 cells to HGF induced the protein expression of Fn14. The elevated expression of Fn14 through HGF stimulation (H2073) or c-Met receptor amplification (H1993) was attenuated by pretreatment of the cells with U0126, a potent MEK inhibitor, suggesting that c-Met-induced Fn14 expression may depend on MAPK signaling. To further elucidate the effect of Fn14 on global c-Met-induced expression, genome-wide expression analysis was employed to determine genes both over-expressed in H1993 compared to H2073 and subsequently suppressed in Fn14 depleted H1993 cells. RALGPS2, a gene over-expressed in lung tumors that induces of c-fos and OPRL1, a gene elevated in metastatic melanoma, were elevated in the metastatic cell line and subsequently suppressed with Fn14 depletion. In addition, shRNA-mediated depletion of Fn14 in H1993 cells attenuated cell migration and invasion by 45% and 40%, respectively. This work demonstrates that c-Met and Fn14 may play a critical role in NSCLC metastasis, and suggests that targeting Fn14 may impact c-Met-driven NSCLC invasiveness. Successful targeting of NSCLC invasiveness would have significant clinical impact on a disease that is deadly in its advanced stages.']",

The service offers molecular profiling for patients with resectable or metastatic disease, in preparation for their next treatment plan.

Biopsies, tissue retrieval and testing is coordinated by Perthera, Inc.From 6/2014 to 11/2015 tumor biopsies, resected or archived tissue was obtained from 152 (53% male) pancreatic cancer patients and profiling including NGS/FISH (144 patients) and IHC (143 patients) was performed. The median age at biopsy or resection was 63 (25-83), 55% of the tissue came from liver, 16% from pancreas, 7% lung, 4% peritoneum, and 18% from another type of tissue. 87% of the patients were diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and the remaining with another form of confirmed or suspected pancreatic cancer.The most identified pathogenic mutations were KRAS (85%), TP53 (72%), CDKN2A (47%), CDKN2B (24%), SMAD4 (22%), ARID1A (10%), STK11 (7%), and BRCA2 (5%). The average number of genomic alterations (likely but not confirmed to be somatic) detected was five per patient from a panel of 320 genes. Molecular modifications that are linked to a treatment option were observed in 44% of patients. Twenty four of 144 patients (17%) had mutations in at least one DNA repair gene potentially benefiting from platinum or PARP inhibitor-based therapies, including BRCA2 (5%), ATM (4%), BAP1 (4%), SMARCA4 (3%), FANC (1%), CHEK2 (1%), and PALB2 (<1%). Other actionable molecular phenotypes observed include anti-HER2 therapies targeting ERBB2 amplifications (3%) and mTOR inhibitors suitable for patients with mutations in STK11/LKB1 (7%), PTEN (3.5%), PIK3R1 (<1%), or PIK3CA (3%). Actionable alterations identified with a low frequency (<2%) include RET fusions, amplifications of FGFR, CRKL, AXL, and mutations in NTRK3, MEN1 (PNET), and BRAF. One patient harbored the BRAF V600E mutation, prompting consideration of off label melanoma-approved therapy. Overexpression of ALK by IHC was observed in one patient who chose to enroll in a ceritinib clinical trial. Six percent of patients were PDL-1 positive, and 22% were positive for PD-1 from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, suggesting possible activity from immune checkpoint inhibitors.To date, 7 of the 152 patients have enrolled in a clinical trial, 4 were treated with an off label treatment, 67 have yet to make their next treatment decision, and 53 are known to be deceased. KYT has successfully profiled tumors and presented targeted treatment options to patients and physicians in 33 states regardless of a patient's socioeconomic background and geographic location, moving the field a step closer towards a democratized, personalized approach to treating pancreatic cancer.\"]",

        "Background":"['Mutations in RAS, RAF, EGFR and PIK3CA genes are present in a number of cancers including colon, lung and breast cancers. Importantly, many of these mutations are predictive biomarkers of clinical outcomes for targeted therapies. This has led to a growing demand for detection of multiple mutations simultaneously. Multiplex formats allow a greater amount of information to be obtained from each sample.PASS primer technology can sensitively and specifically identify the presence of SNPs and somatic DNA changes (point mutations, deletions and insertions) with sensitivity up to 1 in 1,000 (0.1%). PASS primers selectively amplify nucleic acid variants and create amplicons that are markedly different from the parent sequence. The method is superior to ARMS PCR for multiplexing, particularly when mutations are present at the same, adjacent or nearby loci.PASS primers consist of two target specific regions separated by an insert sequence (IS) which is not complementary to the target. A long 5 target-specific region anchors the primer and a short 3 region targets the variant base/s thus directing highly specific binding and extension. During amplification, the IS sequences are incorporated into amplicons, introducing 10 base difference between the starting single base variant and the resulting amplicon. This reduces competition between primers during amplification and facilitates robust discrimination between amplicons during detection.MNAzyme qPCR is a robust alternative to other probe based real-time qPCR protocols such as TaqMan and Beacons. MNAzymes are bi-specific, catalytic oligonucleotide complexes which form in the present of target and cleave universal reporter probes. The bi-specificity, and the use of well-characterised universal probes sets (suitable for use with any group of targets), makes MNAzyme qPCR more amenable to multiplexing. When combined with PASS, MNAzyme qPCR easily discriminates between amplicons since MNAzymes are tailored to specifically detect both the distinct IS and the original mutation.PASS MNAzyme qPCR has been used to facilitate multiplex detection of RAS, RAF, EGFR and PIK3CA mutations. As many as eight mutations located at codons 12 and 13 of RAS have been successfully detected in a single well using three channels on a standard PCR machine. The technology is even more powerful when combined with newer instruments with higher multiplex capabilities such as Biocartis Idylla automated platform. A multiplexed KRAS/BRAF assay, which detects 18 mutations, was evaluated using colon cancer and melanoma FFPE samples. The results showed >96% concordance with sequencing and significantly specificity compared to the singleplex Therascreen KRAS test.Since PASS MNAzyme qPCR affords greater multiplex capacity, along with high specificity and sensitivity, it provides a superior tool for ascertaining mutations from tumour tissues and is particularly well suited for use with liquid biopsies.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

        "Background":"['KCNK9 (TASK-3) encodes a two-pore potassium channel that functions in tumor growth and survival. The potassium channel function is necessary for tumor proliferation and survival, by enhancing resistance to hypoxia and apoptosis. KCNK9 overexpression is observed in melanoma, colorectal cancer, and breast and brain tumors, but with no associated mutations found. Rather, the overexpression is often the apparent result of gene amplification of KCNK9, but any other mechanism that increases expression would presumably have a similar effect on tumorigenesis. This importance of gene dosage and expression levels is particularly relevant, as KCNK9 has been demonstrated to be a maternally expressed imprinted gene, which, in effect, reduces copy number. Monoallelic expression of KCNK9 was originally found in brain tissue, but our work has found that it is also imprinted in breast tissue. Thus, we hypothesized that loss of imprint control would be similar to a gene duplication, increasing the effective copy number, and therefore KCNK9 gene expression. To study the regulation of KCNK9 imprinting in tumors, we have screened for differentially methylated regions that may function as imprint control regions (ICRs), and examined the expression status of KCNK9 in breast tumor samples relative to the methylation state of the putative ICRs. Approximately 40-50% of breast tumor samples analyzed show loss of imprinting, seen as expression of both alleles of an exonic polymorphism. Additionally, loss of methylation at a putative ICR upstream of the transcription start site is observed in combination with loss of imprint regulation. This correlated loss of methylation and imprint control is seen most commonly in tumors of the triple negative subtype - tumors negative for expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2/neu. These novel findings regarding KCNK9 imprint regulation and its disruption in a subset of tumors may lead to new approaches in diagnosis and targeted therapy of breast cancer.']",

However, the molecular mechanism still remains unclear. In this study, we attempted to clarify the post-EMT mechanism in tumor cells.Results', ' Firstly, we prepared tumor cells harvested from metastatic lesions of mice after tumor implantation provisionally as post-EMT tumor cells. Murine metastatic melanoma B16-F10 cells were transduced with a neo resistant gene, and were subcutaneously (s.c.) implanted in many C57BL/6 mice to obtain spontaneous tumor metastasis. Three weeks later, various tissues including bone marrow were harvested from the mice, and the single-cell suspensions were cultured in G418-supplemented medium for tumor selection. To characterize the post-EMT tumor cells, RT-PCR, immunostaining and cellular functional assay were conducted. As compared to the primary tumor cells harvested from s.c. tumor tissues, these tumor cells proliferated extremely slowly, and were resistant to chemotherapeutics, but rapidly grew in vivo after implantation. However, these tumor cells were very adhesive accompanied by increase of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin, but not mesenchymal markers such as Snail, indicating epithelial features. In addition, its chemoresistance and in vivo tumorgenesis activity of these tumor cells were superior to those of even Snail-transduced B16-F10 tumor cells, which were harvested from the metastatic lesions in a similar way. DNA microarray analysis revealed the significant upregulation of epithelial markers and drug resistant genes such as c-kit and GDF15 in the post-EMT tumor cells, as compared to those of the Snail transfectant. These imply that MET may not be just a reversion of EMT.Conclusions', ' These results suggest that tumor cells revert into an epithelial state preserving malignant features acquired via EMT even after Snail lost at the metastatic lesions toward progression.

We have developed a predictive algorithm calculating an individualized mm risk by combining clinical and genetic factors (test Melapred). We evaluated the acceptability of this test in a pilot study of patients seen in dermatology at hospital or in liberal exercise. Methods', ' The Melapred test allows the custom calculation of a personnalized mm risk score using an algorithm incorporating clinical risk factors and genetic mm risk factors. From April to October 2014, 261 patients were proposed to have the Melapred test, and results were given during a second clinical consultation, with explanations provided on the impact of the test result on clinical management and behaviour towards UV exposure. A survey was given to the patients, evaluating the service and potential impact of the Melapred test result. A questionnaire to physicians was also performed evaluating the usefulness of Melapred for high-risk mm patients in their daily exercise. An agreement of the local ethic committee has been obtained. Clinical data were collected on data sheet, and salivary DNA was collected by Oragene kit after information, signature and informed consent. Results', ' The Melapred test classified 64% of patients at high risk, 26% of patients at intermediate risk and 10% at low risk. The survey for the first 163 patients showed a positive evaluation with perception of its usefulness (90%), a clear desire to follow the recommendations of the physicians and to adapte their UV exposition to their mm score, a lack of anxiety generated by pending the result of the test. The physicians also had a very good evaluation of the test in terms of easy logistic, and help to survey and monitoring their patients. Therefore, the Melapred test is very well received and considered useful by patients and physicians, and is not cause of concern. Conclusions', ' Melapred test is well accepted and perceived by patients and physicians. Indications are the identification of high-risk patients and improved screening.

        "Background":"['BRAF is a human gene encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signal pathway, which is important in regulating cellular responses to extracellular signals. Frequent mutations on BRAF gene have been detected in various types of human cancer, including malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, ovarian cancer and hairy cell leukemia. Among all, a single point 1799T>A (V600E) transversion, the most common mutation on BRAF, results in increased kinase activity. It serves as a driver mutation in several types of cancer and confers increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thus, detecting the BRAF V600E mutation may offer valuable information for cancer diagnosis, treatment selection, and prognosis. Here we report a rapid, highly sensitive method for the detection of BRAF V600 mutation using a bridged nucleic acid (BNA) clamp technology associated with quantitative PCR (qPCR). Due to the feature of enhanced affinity for hybridization template, BNA clamp is able to selectively block PCR reactions on the perfect match DNA sequence, while leaves the mismatch template unaffected. In this study several BNA clamps that bind to BRAF V600 wild-type (WT) template was designed, synthesized, and characterized. As compared to DNA clamp counterparts, these BNA clamps increased Tm values for the BRAF V600 WT by greater than 30C. In addition, BNA clamps efficiently distinguished BRAF WT (perfect match) from V600E (mismatch) templates (deltaTm >12C). In qPCR assays BNA clamps could suppress amplification of WT by >1,000-fold, while had little or no effects on the V600E mutant. Such BNA clamps allowed us to detect 1.0% or lower levels for the BRAF V600E mutant in a wild-type background. These results indicate that BNA clamp-based qPCR technology offers a new tool for rapid, sensitive detection of BRAF V600E mutation.

To achieve these goals we integrated multicolor photoacoustic (PA), photothermal (PT) and fluorescent flow cytometry, and combined this technical platform with multiplex molecular targeting strategy using low-toxicity, gold-based functionalized nanoparticles as PA/PT high-contrast agents or genetically encoded proteins (e.g., green fluorescent protein [GFP]) as fluorescent labels. This platform can provide also label-free detection mode using intrinsic (e.g., melanin) molecular labels. The advantages of this new generation of flow cytometries are (1) improving sensitivity by at least a two-order of magnitude compared to available CTC-assays, and (2) significantly extending biomedical applications compared to existing in vivo flow cytometries.Using preclinical tumor-bearing mouse models of metastatic melanoma and breast cancer, and spiked human blood samples, we demonstrated that our technology can overcome great challenge in cancer research related to monitoring lymph, CSF and blood CTCs at single-cell levels in the natural environment in vivo over the long-term period of metastatic disease development from an early micrometastatic stage to deadly multiple macro-metastases. The obtained results allowed us to estimate in vivo cross-correlations between lymph, CSF and blood CTC counts, size of primary tumor and metastasis (micrometastasis) progression. We also showed that the presented approach can break some important diagnostic limitations of existing methods (e.g., low sensitivity) and potentially permits prevention, or at least inhibition, of metastatic progression. Taking into account the safe nature of the PA technology, we anticipate its quick translation for use in humans.Citation Format\", ' Ekaterina I. Galanzha.

Consequently, results from in-vitro experiments can often not be reproduced in the clinic. In contrast, patient derived xenograft models (PDX) more closely mimic the molecular characteristics of patient tumors. In the present study, we analyzed a large part of our collection of patient derived xenografts by means of whole-exome sequencing (WES) to investigate whether their genomic alterations were consistent with those observed in patient tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).Exonic regions from 268 Oncotest PDX were targeted using Agilent SureSelect Human all exon kits 38MB or 51MB. Enriched genomic DNA was sequenced with Illumina HiSeq2000 in 100bp paired-end (PE) reads with expected mean coverage of 100X. The WES data was analyzed for concordance with a) Sanger and Sequenom OncoCarta panels b) patient tumor mutational signatures described by Alexandrov et al.

The mutations in our models were distributed as follows', ' 86% non-synonymous SNVs, 8% small indels (1 nucleotide), 3% splicing site and 3% start/stop gains or losses. The number and the type of mutations varied significantly across tumor types. Similar to the findings of Alexandrov et al., who analyzed TCGA tumors, most of our PDX were characterized by [C>T] transitions that correlated with the patient age. High mutation rates were observed in tissues typically exposed to mutagens, such as melanomas (UV radiation) or lung PDX (tobacco smoke), associated with specific mutation signatures such as increased rates of [C>T] or [C>A] mutations, respectively.Furthermore, we found an association between the presence of mutations in DNA repair genes such as MLH1 and increased mutation levels in some tumor types including colon, gastric and pancreatic cancer. Interestingly, in PDX with high mutation levels, frameshift mutations were increased two-fold, and represented 14% of all mutations. Analyzing our PDX gene mutation profiles and those of the TCGA dataset revealed comparable gene alteration patterns across the tumor types, with some exceptions possibly attributed to the enrichment of aggressive tumors in our collection.This study demonstrates that our PDX tumor collection shows typical signatures of mutational processes and gene alteration patterns similar to patient tumors of the TCGA database.

We designed and implemented a data processing pipeline that integrates novel and commercial analysis software to provide automated rules-based filtering and annotation of variants.Methods', ' We used a targeted resequencing approach with the Fluidigm Access Array system for library creation and molecular barcoding for sample multiplexing. Samples were processed in duplicate to filter out potential false positives. Libraries were sequenced using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) systems. Raw data in FastQ format was preprocessed using Windows batch commands and Perl programs that were integrated with NextGENe (SoftGenetics, State College, PA) analysis software for quality trimming, alignment and variant calling against NCBI curated references. Variant calls were compared between duplicate samples and annotated using a separate Perl program that queried databases containing known germline and somatic variants.Results', ' Quality control was implemented by trimming all downstream reads that contained specified Q-scores (Phred, Q16 or above) as well as requiring a minimum coverage depth of 500X per exon. Only variant calls confirmed at greater than 5% in both duplicate samples and with a balanced ratio of forward and reverse reads were considered reportable in a clinical setting.

We examined DNA methylation for three genes of interest, Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase expressed in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic breast epithelial cells, exhibiting tumor suppressor qualities, Fragile histadine triad (FHIT), encoding a protein involved in cell differentiation and apoptosis, and Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1), a phase II detoxification enzyme in most cell types acting on carcinogens, environmental pollutants, and drugs.

Patient stratification in clinical trials based on molecular features has contributed to recent success of several targeted cancer drugs on molecular aberrations such as BCR-ABL translocation in CML, Her2 amplification in breast and gastric cancers, EGFR mutations and ALK fusions in lung cancer and BRAF mutation in melanoma. However, in most cancers, the molecular features which can be used for patient stratification are not as simple as a single genetic aberration. Multiple drug resistance mechanisms caused by various mutations in cancer signaling pathways can also increase the uncertainty of clinical outcomes.To increase the chance of success in human clinical studies, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) clinical trials (PCTs) have increasingly been used for predictive biomarker validation, resistance mechanism investigation and combination therapy selection. PDX tumor models have been demonstrated to have high correlations with human patients in tumor pathology, molecular characteristics and drug responses. Large scale PCTs have also shown consistency in results when compared to related human clinical trials.At GenenDesign, we have established over 1000 PDX tumor models and more than 100 resistance models against various cancer drugs. Many of these PDX models have been characterized at RNA/Exome sequence, gene expression, gene copy number and hot-spot mutation levels. We carried out our PDX clinical trials by testing multiple approved drugs and clinical drug candidates such as targeted inhibitors against FGFRs, c-Met/ALK, HER2, EGFR, cell cycle regulators, Ras/Raf pathway, PI3K/Akt pathway, as well as chemotherapy drugs in biomarker-driven multi-drug multi-arm expanded PDX clinical trials. So far, we have accumulated more than 3000 efficacy data sets and associated PD samples.Analysis of drug response and associated genomic information from PDX clinical trials yielded rich information for predictive biomarker identification and validation.

Blood samples were collected at baseline (BL), C1D8, C1D15, C2D1, C4D1, and off-study. Level of mutant BRAF RNA in circulating tumor cells isolated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells was assessed by RT-PCR.   Results', '  Twenty pts were evaluable for response. The overall response rate was 10%, disease control rate (DCR) was 45%, and median progression free survival (PFS) was 13 wks.

        "Background":"['PD1 ligands (PDL1) are often upregulated on the cell surface of many different tumors. The primary role of PDL1 in cancer is to inhibit T-cell mediated immune response. Two general mechanisms for PDL1 expression on tumor cells have been proposed. Innate immune resistance, in which PDL1 expression is induced by the constitutive oncogenic signaling, and adaptive immune resistance, in which PDL1 expression is induced by T-cells releasing interferon- (IFN) and activating the STAT signaling pathway. In order to differentiate between these two mechanisms, IFN mRNA expression is measured as an effective alternative to detecting IFN protein. Detection of cytokines by IHC is challenging as secreted proteins are widely diffused and the associated staining pattern appears to lack cellular specificity. RNAscope RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) assay is utilized to measure Interferon- (IFN) mRNA expression, and MultiOmyxTM multiplexed assay (demonstrated to stain up to 60 protein biomarkers) is utilized to measure CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, CD68, PD1, and PDL1 protein expression. In this study, combined MO and RNAscope ISH assays, enabled identification of individual cells with characteristic mRNA and protein expression profile.The MultiOmyx assay utilizes a pair of directly conjugated Cyanine dye-labeled (Cy3, Cy5) antibodies per round of staining. Each Cy-dye conjugated antibody recognizes different target proteins. Each round of staining is imaged and followed by novel dye inactivation chemistry, enabling repeated rounds of staining. RNAscope is a novel RNA ISH assay capable of single-molecule detection in individual cells, utilizing hybridization mediated signal amplification. The assay utilizes a pair of RNA target specific oligonucleotide probes, which sequentially hybridize to preamplifier, amplifier, and fluorophore label probes.Utilizing MultiOmyx and RNAscope assays, this study proposed to profile both RNA and protein expression in lung, breast, melanoma, colorectal, esophageal, and prostate cancer samples.Differentiating PDL1 expression induced in response to inflammatory signals produced by an activated T-cell, from PDL1 expression induced by constitutive oncogenic signaling, has potential implications in effectiveness of PD1 blockade therapy. According to the proposed mechanisms, PD1 blockade as a mono therapy may only benefit individuals with strong endogenous immune response. In individuals with weak endogenous immune response, combinational therapies consisting of both immune activation and PD1-pathway blockade may be more effective than either mono therapy alone.']",

There are several examples where genomic changes are used as molecular biomarkers to stratify patients most likely to benefit from a treatment (e.g. BRAF in melanoma).

Analysis of GDSC data is through a web portal based on queries of specific anticancer drugs or cancer genes. Interactive graphical representations of the data are used throughout with links to related resources, and all datasets are freely available and downloadable.

Good examples of this are EGFR and VEGF. In melanoma, PD-1 interactions involving the immunobiome are therapeutically important. We conducted a study to detect potential mutations that might enhance therapy in colorectal cancer guided by expression of p87, a product of innate immune system Paneth cells. Methods', ' Adnab-9 immunohistochemistry or ELISA was used to define significant p87 Adenoma-associated antigen field effects (FE) in 10 patients with >1cm large high grade dysplastic adenomas (LHiGDA) and 3 with smaller high grade dysplastic adenomas (SHiGDA). We postulated that SHiGDA are not immunologically recognized by host defenses leading to negative outcomes. We used Ion Torrent™ sequencing (ITS) to find mutations in DNA (QiaAmp kit) extracted from 4 normal-appearing colonic segments taken from 1 patient in each group. Novel mutations found on ITS would then be sought using PCR with appropriate primers and subsequent sequencing of the PCR product circulating DNA extracted from available serum samples. These samples were taken from the Large- and SHiGDA groups described above and from 17 patients undergoing colonoscopy for diverse indications. Results', ' p87 FE were found in 40% of 10 LHiGDA and 0% of 3 SHiGDA patients.

PCR using the Jak3 primers used in the ITS and subsequent sequencing revealed the same non-synonymous mutation in the serum of a FAP patient after colonic resection and an additional colonic segment of the selected ShiGDA patient but not in his serum. Other Jak3 mutations were found in 1 of 8 LHiGDA, 1 (the selected patient) of 3 SHiGDA, 1 of 7 patients with FAP and 1 of 10 colonoscopy patients with a family history of colorectal cancer with a FE and an untoward outcome. The selected SHiGDA patient subsequently contracted and died of NSCLC adenocarcinoma. The positive LHiGDA and FAP patients had a severely dysplastic anal condyloma and severe pancreatitis, respectively. Overall, the non-synonymous mutation occurring in the non-FAP SHiGDA patient occurred in the absence of p87 FE. Conclusions', ' In this pilot study we demonstrate the presence of Jak3 mutations likely associated with the lack of p87 expression in patients with high grade dysplastic adenomas and 1 FAP patient. Most of these patients had a clinical course which may have differed from their group members suggesting an altered immune system milieu.

This analysis was performed using a subset of the TCGA data, obtained from blood derived normal samples of cancer patients. All the data was generated using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Inc.) and processed using Nexus Copy Number ver. 6.1 (BioDiscovery, Inc.). The project contained 451 Glioblastoma (GBM), 353 Colon cancer, and 245 Skin cancer samples in addition to 211 HapMap samples which we used as reference since these individuals were supposed to be healthy. Using Fisher's Exact test, we compared each different cancer types to the HapMap samples to identify regions of copy number change with FDR corrected p-value of less than 0.05 and difference in frequency between each population of at least 10%. Many of the regions found in this process encompass regions identified as common CNV polymorphisms as reported in the Database of Genomic Variance (DGV). For example, a polymorphic region on 8p23.1 containing a number of genes from the Beta defensin family involved in defense response to bacterium were seen significantly gained in germline samples obtained from cancer patients as compared to the HapMap samples (11% in HapMap, 42% in Colon Cancer, 28% in GBM, and 32% in Skin cancer). Additionally, some interesting regions were identified that were not seen as polymorphic in the general population, did not show up in the HapMap samples or reported in DGV, but had high prevalence in the blood derived normal samples from cancer patients. Using gene enrichment analysis on genes discovered in these regions we identified a number of known cancer specific pathways that were highly enriched (e.g. KEGG Glioma and Melanoma pathways being statistically significantly enriched). Looking at the effected genes in these pathways we identified small focal and recurrent events that often only spanned a small portion of a gene covering a few exons. This included genes such as PIK3CA where a focal gain covering exons 10-14 were observed in none of the HapMap samples but in 21% of the germline of patients with Colon cancer, 9% of GBM and 14% of Skin cancer patients. A similar focal and recurrent gain was observed in KIT covering exons 2-7 with no gains in the HapMap samples and 55% in Colon, 15% in GBM, and 50% in Skin cancer patients. Similar observations were also made for other well-known cancer genes such as RAF1 and EGFR but to a lesser extent.

        "Background":"['Over the last several years there has been a remarkable convergence of research related to oncogenic aberrations of the spliceosome, which has linked the identification of recurrent spliceosome mutations in tumors to medicinal chemistry. We designed synthetic natural product analogs (the sudemycins) that modulate the activity of the spliceosome and show potent and selective antitumor activity. We hypothesized that splicing gene mutations cause alterations in splice isoforms, which provide a selective advantage to tumor cells, and that perturbation of this environment with spliceosome modulators may cause a selective disadvantage for tumors. To test this hypothesis, we generated MSCV-based retroviruses encoding the wildtype or S34F mutant U2AF1 alleles. We infected c-kit+ primary C57BL/6J murine bone marrow cells with these recombinant retroviruses and cultured them in vitro with cytokine-supplemented media. Vehicle-treated cells expressing the mutant allele had reduced growth over 5 days, compared to cells expressing the wildtype allele or empty vector (P<0.0001, n=5 technical replicates, two experiments). At doses of 10-150 nM, sudemycin D1 (but not the inactive analog sudemycin E-OH) induced a reproducible dose-dependent decrease in cell growth and increase in apoptosis, as measured by Annexin V, in cells expressing the mutant, compared to the wildtype allele or empty vector. To study the effect of the U2AF1 mutation and sudemycin exposure on splicing, we analyzed RNA isoforms of Fmr1, a gene known to undergo alternative splicing. After retroviral transduction, GFP+ cells were sorted and RNA was isolated for RT-PCR analysis at baseline or 2h-6h after exposure to sudemycin D1 (75 nM) or vehicle. The U2AF1 S34F mutation increased the abundance of Fmr1 transcripts utilizing a cryptic splice acceptor, compared to cells transduced with empty vector or wildtype U2AF1 (P<0.05, n=3 technical replicates). These experiments provide proof-of-concept that cells expressing mutant U2AF1 have increased sensitivity to spliceosome modulators. The sudemycins show a short half-life (<15 min) when dosed IV via a bolus tail vein injection. So we have developed a jugular continuous infusion model to achieve therapeutic drug levels, and found that sudemycin D6 is tolerated at doses up to 200 mg/kg/h in mice. Additionally we have investigated numerous drug combinations and found significant cytotoxic co-treatment synergism with the experimental dual mTOR and PI3K inhibitor BEZ235, which suggests opportunities for multi-agent animal studies as a prelude to the design of human clinical trials. In this presentation we will also report in vitro and in vivo data on new sudemycin analogs along with additional work on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, toxicity and in vivo efficacy.

Therapeutic blockade of CTLA-4 or PD-1 pathways has been demonstrated to enhance T cell reactivity to tumor-specific antigens, translating to a significant improvement in overall survival. This anti-tumor effect can be further augmented when PD-1 and CTLA-4 antagonist antibodies are co-administered. The therapeutic impact of this combination is exemplified by the approval of this combination for advanced melanoma, as well as clinical benefit of the combination observed in NSCLC, mRCC, and most recently, mUC. AGEN1884, a human IgG1 antibody directed against CTLA-4, potently inhibits CTLA-4 binding to CD80 and CD86, resulting in enhanced T cell responsiveness in vitro, as well as in a vaccination model in non-human primates. A Phase 1 clinical study (NCT02694822) is currently ongoing to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationships in patients with advanced solid tumors. AGEN2034 is a human IgG4 antibody that binds selectively to PD-1 with high affinity and potentiates T cell responsiveness via the blockade of PD-L1 and PD-L2 binding to PD-1. Here we evaluated the pharmacologic effect of combining AGEN1884 with AGEN2034, and other molecules targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, on primary human T cell immune responses. AGEN1884 combined effectively with AGEN2034, and other antibodies targeting the PD1/PD-L1 pathway, to promote superior T cell immune responses compared to monotherapies. Consistent with these in vitro findings, the co-administration of AGEN1884 with an anti-PD-1 antibody in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) induced a dynamic PD effect, including a proliferative T cell response in peripheral blood, as compared to animals receiving either antibody alone. Finally, co-administration of an anti-mouse CTLA-4 antibody together with Agenus’ tumor-specific neo-epitope-based vaccine (AutoSynVax™) in mice induced effective amplification of vaccine-driven T cell responses, compared to animals that received the vaccine alone. These data further exemplify the versatility of harnessing antibody-mediated CTLA-4 blockade to influence apical events involved in T cell priming by antigen presenting cells. Taken together, these in vitro and in vivo findings demonstrate that the combination of AGEN1884 with PD-1 pathway blockade or with neo-epitope-based vaccines has the potential to provide therapeutic activity that is superior to that of either checkpoint- or vaccine-based monotherapies.']",

        "Background":"['Cancer cells typically display altered glucose metabolism characterized by a preference of aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) resulting in higher levels of glycolytic waste including methylglyoxal (MG). GLO1 (Glyoxalase 1) functions in the detoxification of MG', ' MG reacts with glutathione to form hemithioacetal, which is converted into S-D-Lactoylglutathione by GLO1 and further metabolised into D-lactate by GLO2. When not detoxified, MG acts as a cytotoxic reagent by forming DNA- and protein-adducts (advanced glycation end products = AGEs) that subsequently lead to cell death. Therefore, GLO1 has been discussed as a potential anti-tumor target for highly glycolytic cancers.We confirmed previous reports that GLO1 expression is elevated in several tumor entities as compared to normal tissue. Tumor cells with high GLO1 expression levels are proposed to be highly dependent on GLO1 for removal of toxic MG. Therefore sensitivity to GLO1 inhibition was probed in a panel of cell lines covering lung, colon, breast, prostate and skin cancer with varying GLO1 amplification and expression levels. siRNA-mediated knock down of GLO1 did neither cause significant reduction of cellular proliferation nor significant induction of apoptosis in any of the tested tumor cells. Furthermore, treatment of these cells with a potent GLO1 inhibitor (Chiba et al. Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2012, IC50=11 nM) did not affect proliferation or induce apoptosis at sub-M concentrations. In addition, no increase in AGEs upon GLO1 inhibition could be detected by western blot. Activity of the GLO1 inhibitor was further tested under conditions expected to increase endogenous MG levels such as hypoxia and elevated glucotriose (via GAPDH inhibition). Furthermore, a spheroid assay was developed to test the GLO1 inhibitor in a 3D assay system, better reflecting in vivo tumor growth. Even under hypoxic or spheroidal assay conditions, proliferation of cancer cells could not be reduced upon GLO1 inhibition. We could demonstrate however that GLO1 inhibition in A375 melanoma and SW620 colon adenocarcinoma cells sensitized the cells to exogenous MG.Taken together we could not confirm earlier published data that GLO1 inhibition leads to reduced proliferation and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells that have elevated GLO1 expression levels. Being aware that cellular systems may not reflect the situation in vivo, we speculate that GLO1 function alone may be redundant in detoxifying MG. Other possible enzymes which have been linked to MG removal include aldose reductase. Simultaneous inhibition of both enzymes might be a strategy to target highly glycolytic cancers in the future.']",

In melanoma, breast and prostate carcinomas PDK1 was found amplified and overexpressed and this event correlates with a more aggressive phenotype.The purpose of our study is to unveil the mechanism by which PDK1 regulates cell migration and invasion with the aim to rationally target it in order to prevent tumor cell dissemination.Combining PDK1 stable silencing and PDK1 stable overexpression, we studied PDK1 role in different assays of breast tumor cells migration and invasion.Our data showed that PDK1 silencing in T47D, MDAMB231, MCF10A and MCF10DCIS breast tumor cells determined a potent reduction of chemotactic ability towards different chemoattractants, including serum, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF). Complementary, PDK1 exogenous overexpression, a condition that mimics PDK1 amplification and overexpression in tumors, significantly increased directional migration of MCF10A and MCF10DCIS cells. Surprisingly, the overexpression of a kinase dead mutant of PDK1 was equally able to increase cell migration, suggesting a kinase independent mechanism. We further confirmed this result by treating cells with an ATP competitive small molecule which inhibits PDK1 kinase activity but failed to impair cell migration. Moreover, we found that the kinase dead PDK1 overexpression was able to potently increase the ability of MCF10DCIS cells to invade through a basement membrane layer and to induce the formation of 3D invasive spheroids when cultured embedded in basement membrane matrix. We found that the molecular mechanism underlying the PDK1-mediated regulation of cell migration and invasion is the activation of Myotonic dystrophy kinase-related CDC42-binding kinase alpha (MRCK). This kinase protein is an important regulator of myosin contraction and cytoskeletal dynamics. According to our data, PDK1 is able to increase the kinase activity of MRCK. Moreover, we confirmed the MRCK role by silencing it, resulting in a complete abolition of the effects of PDK1 overexpression.The widespread role of PDK1 in the regulation of tumor cells migration and invasion together with its overexpression status in different tumors, makes it an appealing target for precision medicine. However the simple inhibition of PDK1 kinase activity by ATP competitors couldn't be effective on invasive properties of tumor cells. Future strategies to target PDK1 should take in account these findings by developing allosteric PDK1 inhibitors able to block its kinase independent functions.\"]",

        "Background":"['Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and fatal malignancies worldwide. There are substantial evidences that immunotherapies offer significant benefits among lung cancer patients. Pembrolizumab, a humanized programmed death receptor-1(anti-PD-1) antibody is now approved by FDA as a first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recent data demonstrate that PD-1 is not only expressed by immune cells, but also by human melanoma cells. However, little is known about the biological significance of PD-1 pathway in cancer including NSCLC. Thus, we examined PD-1 expression in a series of established murine lung cancer cell lines. RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of the full coding sequence of the murine PD-1 (PDCD1) gene revealed the presence of PDCD1 mRNA in the M109 lung cancer cells. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated PD-1 protein expression in these murine lung cancer cells. To determine the molecular function of tumor PD-1 in lung cancer survival, we treated M109 cells in culture with either anti- mouse PD-1(100ug/ml) or isotype control antibody and found that PD-1 inhibition significantly enhanced cancer cell viability as measured by MTT and clonogenic assay. Alternative PD1 inhibition by either knockdown of PDCD1 via siRNA or knockout of PDCD1 by CRISPR-Cas9 all lead to increased survival of M109 cells. Furthermore, PDCD1-knockout M109 cells had no survival difference in the presence of anti-PD1 compared to its PD1-expressing parental cells. Conversely, treatment with recombinant PD-L1 fusion protein exhibited significantly increased apoptotic rates (7.5±3.2% vs 2.1±1.2%) suppressing the tumor cell growth in the wild-type M109 in culture. To validate these results in in vivo models, NSG mice were used to determine the direct impact of anti-PD1 on M109 xenografts without the interplay of host immune system. M109 xenografts treated with antiPD-1 (10mg/kg i.p.) antibodies showed accelerated growth compared to those treated by IgG control (2487±473 vs 1499±292mm3 at days 21 after tumor inoculation, p=0.013). M109 subcutaneous tumors in the PD-1 knockout mice also manifested more rapid growth than the same tumors implanted in wild-type mice. Taken together, our results uncover a novel function of PD-1/PD-L1 axis in lung cancer survival and implicate possible tumor-promoting effects from anti-PD-1 therapy upon PD1-expressing lung cancer in the absence of effective immune response. We plan to interrogate bio-specimens collected through NRG trials to establish the translational potential of these findings.']",

To examine the role of RasGRP3 in the viability of cells annexin-V/PI staining was performed. To clarify the function of the protein in cell proliferation and in the developement of resistance against chemotherapeutic drugs Tamoxifen and Herceptin CyQuant assay was performed.

This expression was increased in the tumor samples compared to the normal. RasGRP3 was found typically in the cytoplasm of the cells, while the phosphoRasGRP3 showed strong nuclear reaction. The RasGRP3 expression of the BT-474 cell line was lower then in the metastatics. The downregulation of RasGRP3 induced apoptosis, inhibited cell proliferation and sensitizied the T-47D cells to killing by Tamoxifen and Herceptin. In vivo tumor growth in mouse xenografts of both cell lines were decreased.

Robust methods for molecular characterizations of the immune mechanism in the tumor microenvironment are essential to meet the imminent need for diagnostic approaches that identify patient populations responsive to the growing number of immunotherapeutic treatments. Toward this goal, we developed the Cancer ImmuneNet 2500 (CIN2500) assay for profiling cellular composition in the tumor microenvironment and discovery of novel prognostic and predictive immune response biomarkers.The CIN2500 panel provides signatures for approximately 400 immunity-related genes from 16 predictive and prognostic core genes that have been validated in recent chemo- and immunotherapy clinical trials across several tumor types, including melanoma, colorectal, breast, and lung cancers. In addition, using computational analysis of an immunotherapy network model, we predicted and included in the assay approximately 300 key nodes in pathways specific for antigen presentation and recognition, inhibition, activation and motility of immune cells, and adhesion and apoptosis of cancer cells. The CIN2500 panel also includes a comprehensive set of 1,700 genes specific for detection and quantitative profiling in the tumor microenvironment of different types of activated immune cells of adaptive and innate immunity, and stromal, fibroblast, cancer, endothelial and adipose cell types.The CIN2500 assay quantitatively profiles the expression levels of approximately 2,500 key cancer genes from 10-100ng of total RNA using multiplex RT-PCR amplification followed by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Built-in standards for each gene target enable sample-to-sample calibration of the NGS data and provide a reference to adjust for background noise that often depends on the quality of samples. Control studies have shown that the CIN2500 assay quantifiably measures 4 orders of magnitude variation in the expression levels of 2,500 immune-related genes from as few as 100 cells in whole lysate, and profiles from frozen biopsies, surgically-removed tumor samples, PBMCs, and FFPE clinical samples show a comparable range and sensitivity.

        "Background":"['Acquired drug resistance is a long-standing problem of cancer therapeutics. The issue has become even more vexing with the development of highly selective agents; resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib is acquired frequently in lung adenocarcinomas. Thus, anticipating acquired resistance and understanding its basis may help us develop strategies to prevent or circumvent occurrence. Through its receptor tyrosine kinase Met, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) regulates mitogenesis, motogenesis, and morphogenesis during development and adulthood. HGF/Met signaling also contributes to cancer progression in many malignancies, including glioblastoma. Rilotumumab is a fully human neutralizing monoclonal antibody against HGF tested in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials, including mono therapy in renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma, as well as combination trials in gastric, colorectal, small cell lung cancers and castrate resistant prostate cancer.To generate a cellular model of acquired resistance to rilotumumab, an HGF/Met dependent human glioblastoma-derived cell line (U87-MG) was grown in rilotumumab (600 nM) for 120 days. Growth rate, HGF secretion, Met content and Met activation state were 10-fold, 10,000-fold, 10-fold and 80-fold higher than the parental cell values, respectively. The HGF and MET coding sequences were normal in both parental and resistant cells. Quantitative PCR studies to determine mRNA levels of all HGF isoforms revealed a dramatic increase in full-length HGF transcript. CGH array studies indicated amplification within both HGF and MET genes. Xenograft studies confirmed that tumor growth was resistant to rilotumumab, however the resistant cell line and tumors remained sensitive to a highly selective Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suggesting that resistance was achieved via increased HGF/Met signaling rather than mutation or activation of alternate pathways. Microarray expression analysis demonstrated transcript profiles that were consistent with HGF/Met pathway activation. Thus the molecular basis of acquired resistance in this model differs from those prevalent in', ' [1] lung cancers treated with EGFR inhibitors and medulloblastomas treated with hedgehog inhibitors, where most cases acquire secondary mutations in the targeted kinase; [2] breast cancers treated with HER2 inhibitors, where PTEN loss, p27 downregulation, and activation of other receptors are primary causes; or [3] malignant melanoma treated with BRAF inhibitors, where increased signaling via multiple pathways lead to PI3K- and/or MEK-mediated reactivation of the MAPK pathway. In addition to the importance of HGF/Met pathway activity in selecting glioblastoma patients for HGF-targeted therapeutics, our results suggest that monitoring Met pathway activity could provide early indications of acquired resistance to these agents, and that Met kinase inhibitors may still be efficacious when resistance occurs.']",

This oncogenic mutation in the BRAF gene constitutively activates the MAPK signaling pathway and results in increased proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. BRAF V600E mutation was described in approximately 8% of all solid tumors (43% melanomas, 39-67% papillary thyroid carcinomas and 12% colorectal adenocarcinomas). However, it is challenging to identify patients with this mutation. Currently, the gold standard is sequencing of the tumor DNA, but this method is not practical for routine practice. In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a relatively easy diagnostic tool to detect proteins in paraffin-embedded tissues. The major goal of this study was to compare detection of BRAF V600E by sequencing and IHC using anti-BRAF V600E (VE1) antibody. This clone is mutation specific and can distinguish the V600E mutation in BRAF from the wild type BRAF protein.Methods', \" Tissues from sixty-nine patients with colon cancer (N=40) and thyroid cancer (N=29) were evaluated for the BRAF V600E mutation.

In recent years, we have developed a collection of >40 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from PDAC. In order to determine their relevance for anticancer agent testing, we extensively characterized our models for histology features, whole exome mutations (Hiseq 2000), chromosome rearrangements, gene copy number variations (Affymetrix SNP6) and gene expression (Affymetrix U133 Plus2.0).PDAC from 65 patients were implanted into immuno-compromised mice, resulting in the development of 42 PDX models (success rate 65%). The PDAC from which models were established included moderate and poorly differentiated tumors and were heterogeneous for stroma content. In patient tumors, we showed fibroblast activation but not stroma content predicted poor patient outcome (p<0.0001) and success of PDX establishment (p<0.01). Correlating with those of the parental tumors, the resulting PDAC_PDX also showed heterogeneity for stroma content and for murine fibroblast activation. As seen in patient tumors, the PDAC_PDX were characterized by frequent chromosomal instability, with 38% of the models presenting a moderate hypoploidy while the 62% remaining ones showed a hyperploidy. Two models showed hypermutation due to mismatch repair deficiency while the others had on average a lower mutation load when compared to other histotypes such as colon, lung or melanoma tumors. In total, we identified more than 9000 genes altered by homozygous deletions, high gene amplifications and/or mutations, most of the models showed alterations in KRAS (81%), TP53 (67%), CDKN2A (64%) and TGFBR2/SMAD4 (64%) genes. Next, PDAC_PDX profiles were merged with those of patient tumors to determine PDAC_PDX subtypes and were found to be of the classical (61%), quasi mesenchymal (QM) (34%) and exocrine like subtype (5%) according to the 62 gene expression signature established by Collisson et al. 2011. Preliminary biomarker analysis revealed certain associations between genomic alterations and transcriptome subtypes, such as more frequent alterations in the TGFB pathway in classical PDX (80%) compared to QM (47%). Further detailed biomarkers analyses also addressing questions of molecular determinants of stroma content, of fibroblast activation and of sensitivity toward anticancer agents will be presented.Extensive characterization of our PDAC_PDX collection revealed similarities with patient tumors with regards of histology features including stroma content and fibroblast activation.

Particularly, the phenotype markers and the functional role of MSCs are not fully defined yet in tumor immunology, although demonstrated in regenerative medicine fields. We recently found that Snail+ tumor cells undergoing EMT preferentially metastasized into bone marrow (BM) than other organs such as spleen and lymph node, accompanying increase of MSC-like cells. In this study, we elucidated the molecular mechanism and the MSC features for the further understanding of immunosuppressive mechanism in host with cancers. Results', ' When BM cells of C57BL/6 mice were cultured with supernatant of murine snail-transduced melanoma B16-F10 cells for 7-14 days, CD45-Vimentin+ mesenchymal cells were significantly increased as compared with the control with mock transfectant. These cells showed the ability to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteocytes, indicating MSC generation by Snail+ tumor cells. CD45- MSCs were also increased in BM of the mice 2-3 weeks after Snail+ tumor implantation. These Snail-induced MSCs (sMSCs) showed much higher suppressive activity on T-cell proliferation followed by Treg increase than the MSCs stimulated with mock-transfected B16-F10 supernatant. When B16-F10 cells were subcutaneously co-injected with the sMSCs in mice, tumor growth and metastasis was significantly promoted in C57BL/6 mice, but not in immunodeficient mice, implying requirement of other immune cells for the sMSC efficacy. Utilizing EGFP+ mice or GFP+ B16-F10 tumor cells, we found that the co-injected sMSCs mainly migrated and accumulated in lymphatic organs such as spleen. In the spleen, CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs and Foxp3+ Treg cells were increased, and CD8+ T cells were disabled for IFN induction and tumor-killing, indicating CTL impairment following accumulation of various immunoregulatory cells. The sMSCs also significantly suppressed T-cell proliferation in vitro. On the other hand, the co-injected tumor cells rapidly metastasized into BM of the mice, suggesting EMT induction by the sMSCs. We identified the sMSC markers and the sMSC inducers that produced from Snail+ tumor cells. Blocking of the sMSC inducer with the specific siRNA resulted in decrease of the sMSCs and tumor cells in BM, accompanying improvement of anti-tumor immune responses in the mice. Conclusions', ' These results suggest that Snail+ bone-metastatic tumor cells increase sMSCs that induce MDSCs and Treg cells leading to systemic spread of immunosuppression in host. The sMSCs also stimulate noninvasive tumor cells to migrate into BM, resulting in further amplification of the immunosuppressive cascade.

        "Background":"['Dysregulation of ERK signaling is a common event in malignancy. Receptor activation of RAS leads to dimerization and activation of RAF kinase, which in turn activates ERK. Physiologic activation of the pathway is limited by ERK dependent feedback inhibition of RAS activation and other components of the pathway. Oncogenic mutations and translocations of RAF family members have been identified in many human tumors and serve as drivers of tumor growth. We now show that these mutants are active despite feedback inhibition of RAS and that this is associated with dysregulated ERK output. All translocations and almost all of the RAF mutants tested so far form RAS-independent constitutive dimers, the activity of which is dependent on their dimerization. Mutations at one site, V600E and V600K allow RAF to function as a monomer in cells with low RAS activity and as a RAS-dependent dimer in cells with adequate RAS activity. In tumors expressing any of these mutants, RAF/MEK/ERK activity is elevated despite feedback inhibition of RAS. Currently available RAF inhibitors bind to one protomer of the RAF dimer and cause negative cooperativity of binding to the second site. This is sometimes associated with transactivation of the unbound protomer. These inhibitors cannot be used to inhibit ERK signaling in tumors in which ERK is driven by RAF-dimers (those with mutant RAS, NF1 loss, atypical RAF mutations, RAF translocations.) In contrast, in tumors with V600E BRAF mutations, ERK causes strong feedback inhibition of RAS and V600E BRAF exists as a monomer that is inhibited by these drugs. Acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors usually results from a molecular lesion that causes RAS-dependent or independent dimerization of V600E (NRAS mutation, V600E BRAF amplification, V600E aberrantly spliced isoform.) Current RAF inhibitors inhibit V600E BRAF dimers at concentrations 10-100 fold greater than those required to inhibit the corresponding monomer in cells. We take this as a provisional measure of the degree of negative cooperativity of binding to the second site. We have now identified inhibitors that inhibit V600E dimers at concentrations close (1-3 fold higher) than those required to inhibit the monomer. They do not cause dissociation of dimers and their inhibition is abolished by gatekeeper mutations. Phenotypically, therefore, binding of these compounds to dimers is associated with only minimal negative cooperativity. These drugs inhibit ERK signaling and the proliferation of tumor cells with atypical BRAF mutations and translocations as well as V600E melanoma models with acquired resistance to Vemurafenib. However, they are much less active in cancer cells with KRAS mutation or receptor-dependent activation of RAF. Selective inhibitors of subsets of RAF dimers may allow effective ERK inhibition of large subset of tumors without inhibiting signaling in normal cells.']",

        "Background":"['Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) accounts for approximately 2% of diagnosed malignancies in canines. The majority of canine TCCs are invasive, intermediate to high grade tumors sharing similarities with human muscle invasive TCCs in risk factors, histology, sites of metastasis, and therapeutic response to single agents. Whole exome sequencing of canine TCC tumors was performed to identify somatic mutations in known cancer driver and repressor genes that could potentially contribute to canine TCC pathogenesis. A valine to glutamic acid mutation in BRAF homologous to the activating V600E mutation identified in human melanoma, colorectal and thyroid cancers was identified in 70% of sequenced tumors. Sensitivity to the BRAFV600E inhibitor Vemurafenib was tested in three BRAF mutant canine TCC cell lines (Bliley, Tyler1 and Tyler2) and two BRAF wild type canine TCC cell lines (Angus1 and Kinsey). All five canine TCC cell lines exhibited IC50s greater than 10μM, with BRAF mutant cell lines being slightly more sensitive. These sensitivity ranges are similar to those of some mutant human colorectal cancer cell lines, indicating that additional mechanisms may contribute to Vemurafenib resistance. Western blot analysis was performed to measure relative abundance of pERK, a downstream target of BRAF, in canine TCCs in response to serum starvation. All TCC cell lines showed sustained pERK expression in the absence of serum, indicating constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. The five canine TCC lines were treated with 15μM Vemurafenib for 6 and 24 hours and their lysates were analyzed for pERK protein expression. pERK abundance was decreased in only the BRAF mutant cell lines after 6 hours of treatment. However, this decrease was less pronounced after 24 hours, suggesting that resistance mechanisms are bypassing BRAF to activate ERK. Sequence analysis of an additional panel of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded canine TCCs also revealed a mutation in RanBP2 in 31% of samples. Strikingly, the RanBP2 mutation appeared to be mutually exclusive to BRAF V to E mutant tumors with only two of the analyzed samples carrying both mutations. Significant tumor heterogeneity was implicated due to low level mutant amplification in these samples. It has been reported that loss of RanBP2 is synthetic lethal in BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer. Since RanBP2 forms complexes with CRM1 at the nuclear pore complex for nuclear export and at the kinetochore during mitosis, canine TCC cell lines were treated with KPT-185, a CRM1 inhibitor. BRAF mutant TCC cell lines had IC50 values ranging from 45nM to 65nM and were approximately ten-fold more sensitive than wild type cell lines. Overall, this data indicates that the pathogenesis of canine TCC likely depends on driving factors in addition to constitutive BRAF signaling, but Vemurafenib resistant BRAF mutant tumors can be targeted through inhibition of the nucleopore complex.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', \" The use of liquid biopsies, where limited or no tumor tissue is available, is increasingly important for molecular demographics, diagnostics and pharmacodynamic monitoring of patients during therapy.The ICE COLD-PCR (ICP) technique preferentially amplifies sequence alterations in samples having either vast excesses of wild-type sequence or when sample DNA quantity is sub-optimal. ICP delivers unbiased, high-level enrichment of gene regions enabling determination of point mutations and insertions/deletions using Sanger sequencing, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) or droplet digital PCR (ddPCR).This is especially important when sample DNA, e.g. from circulating free DNA, exosomes and circulating tumor cells (CTCs), is insufficient for multiplexed analysis.A critical limitation of mutational analysis of such samples is the need for increasing amounts of DNA for detecting very low-level mutations. A range of 100 to330 ng of substrate DNA is usually needed for reliable detection of alterations present at 0.01% in the sample DNA; this is not feasible with the limited quantities of blood/plasma/serum from clinical trials. ICP's ability to enrich alterations can provide a 100-fold increase in Sanger, NGS and ddPCR sensitivity.Materials and Methods\", ' To increase throughput, address the limiting amounts of DNA present in these samples and provide enriched amplification from many different gene regions in a single DNA sample, a multiplex ICP approach has been developed (MX-ICP). This MX-ICP method provides enrichment of any alteration present in all targeted genes from a single sample of DNA. When MX-ICP products are analyzed by Sanger, NGS or ddPCR, lower quantities of sample DNA can be used for detection of mutations at 0.01%.We compared detection of low-level of mutations in limiting amounts of DNA, with or without the use of MX-ICP prior to NGS and ddPCR, using digitally verified chromosomal DNA mixtures from Horizon Diagnostics. The alterations analyzed were from (1) CTC and NSCLC patients plasma, (2) longitudinal sampling of melanoma patients and (3) CTCs isolated from NSCLC patients. In all cases, use of MX-ICP, prior to analysis using NGS or ddPCR, enabled very sensitive detection with low amounts of input DNA.Conclusion', ' MX-ICP is a key component of procedures for sensitive detection and monitoring of genetic alterations in multiple targets using a single DNA sample. Coupling MX-ICP with platforms such as NGS and ddPCR enables the use of these powerful technologies for high sensitivity detection and monitoring of liquid biopsies from cancer patients. The combination of MX-ICP with NGS and ddPCR platforms means that they can be used efficiently for detection of alterations at0.01% in samples with <100 ng DNA. This enables monitoring and detection of alterations in the low volumes of liquid biopsies obtained from patients and clinical trials.']",

        "Background":"['Background', \" Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are rare tumor cells shed from a patient's tumors into the circulation. It has been hypothesized that CTCs could be used as a liquid biopsy to obtain repeat molecular characterizations and provide dynamic insight into the biology of an underlying cancer. However, due to the low abundance of CTCs and technical limitations in the single-cell sequencing, it had been very difficult to characterize CTCs on a whole genome scale. The surrogacy of CTCs for conventional tumor tissues has never been demonstrated beyond targeted genomic alterations such as shared ETS fusions in prostate cancer (PC), EGFR mutations in lung cancer and BRAF mutations in melanoma. With recent technical advances in single-cell sequencing and single-CTC isolation technologies, we present the first study using whole genome sequencing (WGS) of isolated serially-collected single CTCs in a PC patient.Method\", ' By combining NanoVelcro CTC Chip with laser microdissection, we developed a robust platform for single-CTC isolation. Subsequent WGS was performed after the multiple displacement amplification of our single-CTC DNA. From a PC patient, we performed WGS on four of his CTCs on two different time point, his primary prostatectomy tissue and liver metastasis along with WBC and normal adjacent tissue from the prostatectomy as controls. Copy number variations, single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and structural variations (SVs), including rearrangements were identified for comparison.Results', ' We successfully performed WGS on isolated single CTCs, achieving 30X depth and >95% coverage. SNV analysis reveals that 33.5% (289/863) of founder somatic mutations (defined as mutations shared between primary and metastatic tumors) can be found in CTCs. Looking into the mutational landscape of CTCs, 48% of the CTC mutations can be traced back to either primary or metastatic tumor. Per SV analysis, we found and validated an intrachromosomal rearrangement in chr3 and an interchromosomal rearrangement between chr13 and chr15. These rearrangements are shared between both tumor tissues and most of the CTCs, but not discovered in WBC and normal adjacent tissue. At the same time, highly heterogeneous short SVs were discovered in PTEN, RB1 and BRCA2 in all tumor samples, suggesting a continuous evolution of SVs in these important tumor suppressor genes.Conclusion', ' Based on our capability to obtain high-quality WGS from single-CTCs, we validate the genomic surrogacy of CTCs by the detection of shared SNVs and rearrangements between CTCs and tumor tissues. The heterogeneous mutational landscapes of SNVs and SVs are also discovered in single-CTCs, indicating the value of our single-CTC WGS approach. We envision our single-CTC WGS approach will be utilized for studying tumor heterogeneity and the biological evolution of cancer during disease progression, even during anticancer therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Dysregulation of the CDK4/6-Rb pathway is a hallmark of various tumor types. Cancer cells subvert different cell cycle checkpoints to continue unchecked growth and proliferation. Some common mechanisms of overcoming cell cycle checkpoints involve loss of tumor-suppressor proteins such as p16 INK4A or Retinoblastoma (Rb). Alternately, cancer cells can also increase expression of oncogenes like cyclin D1, other CDKs by gene amplification or gene translocation. Thus, targeting different oncogenes in the cell cycle pathway, particularly CDKs has been considered an important therapeutic strategy. Events of overexpression of cell cycle oncogenes and suppression of tumor suppressors are mutually exclusive and tumor-type specific. In colorectal cancer (CRC), it has been shown that there is overexpression of CDK4/6 . We conducted TCGA analysis of 50 matched tumor and normal CRC tumors, and validated that CDK4 and CDK6 are significantly overexpressed in patient tumor samples by RNA-seq (p= 1.55 e-09 and p= 4.439 e-05). Thus, ongoing clinical trials for CRC patients with advanced disease are currently evaluating the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors as single agents and in combination with chemotherapy (J Clin Oncol 33, 2015 ,suppl 3; abstr 626; Zhang 2016). We evaluated the efficacy of miRNAs targeting CDK4/6 as novel therapeutics in CRC. We performed in silico analysis using TargetScan to identify miRNAs that can target the 3’UTR regions of CDK4/6. We have identified a novel family of miRNAs (based on seed sequence similarity) that can potently target CDK4/6 mRNA and thereby reduce both the RNA and protein levels of CDK4/6 in cancer cells. Of the four miRNAs in the family, we chose to characterize miR-6883-5p and miR-149* in a panel of CRC, melanoma and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Our preliminary TCGA analysis in 11 matched T/N samples shows miR-149* expression is significantly lost (p= 0.0049) in CRC samples and this further positively correlates with the stage of the tumor. Ongoing in vitro studies using miRNA mimics in CRC cell lines indicate that both miR-6883-5p and miR-149* have anti-proliferative effects as assayed by CellTiterGlo (CTG) and MTT. Further, both miRNAs induce G1-arrest as a consequence of downregulation of CDK4 and CDK6 in all cell lines and we also observe induction of apoptosis in a subset of CRC cell lines. Knockdown of CDK4 and CDK6 mimics the phenotypes observed with restoring expression of both miR-6883 and miR-149* in CRC cell lines. Combination of miR-6883 with FDA-approved drugs Irinotecan and 5-FU showed strong synergy and led to apoptosis as assayed by CTG and PARP cleavage. Our ongoing work is further looking into the mechanisms of synergy and identifying additional target genes in CRC cell lines. Thus, our novel miRNA based strategy to target CDK4 has potential to translate as both a single agent/combinatorial therapy and to identify biomarkers of response, which is critical for understanding the clinical results seen with CDK inhibitors.']",
