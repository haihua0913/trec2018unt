        "Meeting_name":" A novel mechanism of microenvironment-mediated drug resistance in BRAF V600E melanoma with loss of PTEN",
        "Background":"['Despite recent success of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib in the clinic, nearly all of those treated follow a course in which initial tumor regression was followed by eventual relapse, which constitutes a major barrier to long-term therapeutic management of melanoma. We have identified a novel mechanism of microenvironment-mediated drug resistance that arises from the release of TGF from melanomas that lack PTEN expression leading to the recruitment of host fibroblasts and the generation of a protective microenvironment through autocrine and paracrine fibronectin secretion facilitating therapeutic escape. Preliminary studies show that BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cell lines that lacked PTEN expression dramatically increased their secretion of TGF- following vemurafenib treatment, as detected by western blot, immunofluorescence and ELISA assays. Furthermore, autocrine TGF secretion initiated with vemurafinib treatment stimulated the upregulation and secretion of fibronectin in PTEN- cells. The vemurafenib-mediated ECM remodeling in this case was dependent upon autocrine TGF signaling and could be attenuated following pre-treatment with the TGF receptor kinase inhibitor SB505124 or by siRNA knockdown of TGF receptor I. A mass spectrometry based phospho-proteomic screen in conjunction with innovative network modeling approaches suggested that increased integrin 51 signaling was a key adaptive response of PTEN- melanoma cells to BRAF inhibitor therapy. The importance of increased fibronectin expression and integrin 51 signaling in the therapeutic escape of PTEN- melanoma cells was confirmed by the significant increases in vemurafenib-induced apoptosis observed following siRNA knockdown of either integrin 5, 1, or fibronectin expression. A mass spectrometry screen (LC-MRM) of 18 BH3 proteins demonstrated Mcl-1 and Bak to be critical apoptosis regulators in the microenvironment-mediated drug resistance response. The importance of PTEN loss and Mcl-1 downregulation in therapeutic escape was validated in PTEN- melanoma cell lines expressing doxycycline inducible forms of PTEN, lipid phosphatase mutant PTEN and Mcl-1. Novel organotypic co-culture models were developed to demonstrate that TGF- released from PTEN- melanoma cell lines activated host fibroblasts leading to the attenuation of drug response in the tumor cells. Our overall hypothesis is that BRAF inhibition remodels both the melanoma and host microenvironments to provide a protective sanctuary for the minor populations of melanoma cells that escape therapy. We postulate that tumor eradication can only be achieved by a dual therapeutic strategy that targets both the bulk tumor and the microenvironment.']",

        "Background":"['Vemurafenib is a BRAF inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of BRAF V600E-positive metastatic melanoma after a phase III clinical trial demonstrated improved survival in patients taking vemurafenib compared to dacarbazine. As the first personalized treatment for metastatic melanoma to show a survival benefit, vemurafenib is a major breakthrough in the field. Although tumors in patients frequently shrink significantly within weeks of initiation of treatment, resistance eventually develops in many patients, with a median progression free survival of approximately 7 months. Evaluation of the biomarker and phenotypic correlates of response are difficult to determine as paired pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsies generally only represent one on-treatment time point when available. A better in vivo understanding of the effects of BRAF inhibitor-treatment of relevant mouse models may yield insights into the nature of the clinical response and subsequent relapse. The conditional BRAF/PTEN mouse model of melanoma that we co-developed is ideal to study this process. In this non-xenograft model, expression of BRAF V600E and loss of PTEN is under control of the Cre-Lox recombination system. Expression of the Cre recombinase is under control of the tyrosinase promoter, ensuring that recombination is limited to melanocytes. The Cre recombinase is fused to an estrogen receptor that inhibits the activity of the recombinase. Activation of the Cre recombinase requires topical application of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, allowing for induction of recombination at specific time points in the life span of the mouse. The use of this mouse model allows for more thorough evaluation of the time course and phenotype of BRAF-inhibitor response in melanoma in an immunocompetent host. Specific studies include evaluation of the effect of PLX4720 on the expression, localization, and activation of proteins involved with growth arrest, apoptosis, and glucose uptake.']",

        "Meeting_name":" ASN003, a highly selective inhibitor of B-Raf and PI3 kinases, shows strong antitumor activity in B-Raf inhibitor resistant patient-derived xenograft models.",
        "Background":"['The RAS-RAF-MEK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways are two major signaling pathways involved in human cancer. Components of these two pathways are frequently mutated in a wide variety of solid tumors. Concurrent double mutations in the two pathways are also observed quite often in a broad range of tumor types. Additionally, inhibition of one of these pathways often leads to the upregulation of the other pathway and development of resistance. In preclinical models, combined inhibition of both pathways has been shown to impart greater efficacy as compared to inhibition of either pathway alone. ASN003 is a novel, highly selective, small-molecule inhibitor of both RAS-RAF and PI3K pathways, discovered using a rational design approach. ASN003 shows potent inhibitory activity against B-RAF and PI3K kinases (low nM IC50). Within the PI3K family, ASN003 has high selectivity for inhibition of PI3Kα and PI3Kδ over PI3Kβ. In a panel of 292 kinases, ASN003 showed high selectivity for inhibiting B-RAF and PI3 kinases, and associated mutant kinases. In cell-based mechanistic studies, ASN003 inhibited phosphorylation of ERK, AKT and S6, and showed strong antiproliferative activity (IC50 = 60-300 nM) in cell lines with B-RAF and PI3K pathway mutations as well as in vemurafenib-resistant cell lines. In pharmacodynamic studies in multiple tumor models, ASN003 showed strong inhibition of the phosphorylation of downstream targets of B-RAF and PI3K, confirming appropriate target engagement. In in vivo efficacy studies, ASN003 showed strong tumor growth inhibition or regression in multiple tumor xenograft models, including A375 (B-Raf V600E mutation), RKO (B-Raf V600E and PIK3CA mutations), and A2058 (B-Raf V600E mutation and PTEN loss). We now report that ASN003 also showed strong tumor growth inhibition (>80%) in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model established from a relapsed patient with progressive B-Raf mutant melanoma who showed initial response to vemurafenib. Sequencing analysis showed that the vemurafenib resistant tumor acquired a concurrent PIK3CA mutation. Dual targeting of the B-RAF and PI3K pathways with ASN003 has the potential to treat and/or prevent the acquired resistance to selective B-RAF inhibitors, and may also treat a broader patient population and provide greater efficacy and survival benefit than selective B-RAF inhibitors or selective PI3K pathway inhibitors alone. ASN003 is currently in Phase I clinical development in patients with advanced solid tumors, including tumors with B-Raf V600 mutation, PI3 kinase pathway alterations or PTEN loss.']",

        "Background":"['BACKGROUND', ' BRAF/MEK inhibitors have shown promising levels of response in melanomas harboring the BRAF V600E mutation, however responses tend to be short-lived and resistance is a major clinical problem. In the current study, we evaluated the pharmacological activity of BI847325, a dual inhibitor of MEK and Aurora kinases against multiple melanoma cell line models.METHODS', ' The cytotoxic effect of BI847325 was evaluated in vitro in a panel of selected BRAF-mutant vemurafenib resistant cell lines by Alamar blue and Annexin V binding assay. 3D spheroid model systems and colony formation assays demonstrated the long-term growth inhibitory effect of BI847325. Western blot analysis and qRT-PCR studies were carried out to evaluate the mechanism underlying BI5-mediated cytotoxicity. In vivo studies in Balb SCID mice were performed to assess the suppression of BRAF-mutant xenografts on treatment with BI847325.RESULTS', ' BI847325 potently reduced the growth and survival of BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines with acquired and intrinsic BRAF inhibitor resistance (NRAS mutations, BRAF splice forms, Cyclin D1 amplification, RTK upregulation, PTEN loss, COT amplification). We confirmed that BI847325 induced apoptosis through decrease in Mcl-1 mRNA and protein expression and increase in BIM expression. The effects of BI847325 upon BIM and Mcl-1 expression could not be mimicked by the combination of other MEK and aurora kinase inhibitors. For the first time we demonstrated that BI847325 reverses the acquired vemurafenib resistance by inhibiting MEK expression at mRNA and protein level. A strong suppression of MEK expression was observed without recovery following 72 h of washout. In vivo studies revealed complete tumor suppression with no recurrence over a period of 65 days of treatment with 70mg/kg/week dose of BI847325. In contrast, treatment with vemurafenib analog PLX4720 in the same mouse model was associated with tumor relapse after 30 days of treatment. BI847325 also successfully suppressed the long-term growth of xenografts with acquired vemurafenib resistance. Analysis of tumor samples complied with in vitro results demonstrating inhibition of phospho-ERK, phospho-Histone3, Mcl-1 and total MEK.CONCLUSION', ' In conclusion we report for the first time that BI847325, a novel ATP-competitive MEK/ Aurora kinase inhibitor effectively inhibits BRAF-mutant melanoma and overcomes vemurafenib-resistance by decreasing expression of MEK and Mcl-1; in vitro and in vivo. Further preclinical and clinical investigations towards this would open new avenues in treatment of melanoma.']",
