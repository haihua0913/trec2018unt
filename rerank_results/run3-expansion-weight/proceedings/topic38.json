        "Background":"['The isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 genes are mutated in acute myelogenous leukemia, low-grade glioma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and chondrosarcomas. IDH1 and IDH2 normally function to convert isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate. However, when these enzymes are mutated at select residues the mutant enzymes now convert -KG into 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). In normal cells, 2-HG levels are typically extremely low, but IDH1/2 mutant cells can accumulate up to 10 mM 2-HG. In an effort to counteract the neomorphic activity of mutant IDH enzymes, we identified and developed potent inhibitors of IDH1. The compounds inhibit IDH1 catalytic activity in biochemical assays and reduce 2-HG production in IDH1-mutant cell lines. Consistent with the fact that 2-HG inhibits -KG dependent enzymes including histone demethylases and Tet family hydroxylases, these IDH1 inhibitors induce a decrease in several histone methylation marks and also DNA methylation. These data demonstrate that small molecule inhibitors can reverse many of the epigenetic effects of mutant IDH1.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

We discovered IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in 29 of 305 (9%) intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. Tumors with mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 had lower 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and higher 5-methylcytosine levels, as well as increased dimethylation of histone H3K79. Mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 were independently associated with longer time to recurrence of cholangiocarcinoma in multivariate analysis (p = 0.046). We identified 2,267 genes that were significantly hypermethylated in tumors with mutations in IDH1 or IDH2. Hypermethylated CpG sites were significantly enriched in CpG shores and in the 1500 bp upstream of annotated transcription start sites, suggesting a global regulation of transcriptional potential. Gene expression profiling of 7 IDH1/2-mutant and 20 IDH1/2-wildtype tumors revealed increased expression of citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, as well as decreased expression of cytoskeleton organization genes.

Recently comprehensive genetic profiles have elucidated novel fusion genes and somatic mutations. Although somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and KRAS gene were frequently found in ICC, the clinical features of this malignancy with mutations in these genes remain unclear.Materials and Methods', ' A cohort of 49 patients with ICC who underwent curative resection from 2000 to 2013 at Okayama University Hospital were enrolled and analyzed. KRAS (exon2), IDH1 (codon132), and IDH2 (codon172 and codon140) mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Associations between the mutational profiles of these genes and clinic-pathological features were investigated. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted, and survival rates were compared using the log-rank analysis.Results', ' KRAS mutations were observed in twelve ICC patients (24.5%, KRAS-mutant). IDH mutations were found in eight patients (16.3%); five patients harbored IDH1 mutations and three patients harbored IDH2 mutations (IDH1/2-mutant). Among three patients with IDH2 mutations, a rare IDH2 R140L was identified. One patient harbored both KRAS G12A and IDH2 R172K mutations (classified as KRAS-mutant). The rest of 30 ICCs harbored no mutation in either KRAS or IDH1/2 gene, thus categorized as Wild-type. Infection of Hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) was observed in 10 ICCs (6 ICCs were HBV-positive and 4 ICCs were HCV-positive). Of 10 ICCs with viral infection, only two ICCs harbored KRAS mutations (categorized as virus-infected) and eight ICCs with viral infection harbored no mutation in KRAS and IDH1/2 genes. Finally, ICCs were divided into four subsets; viral-infected, KRAS-mutant, IDH1/2-mutant, and others). With regard to clinic-pathological features, lymph node metastasis was more frequently observed in KRAS-mutant (p = 0.039) compared with the others. IDH1/2 -mutant were more frequently observed in mass-forming type (p = 0.047). By survival analysis, 3-years survival rate was 85.7% in IDH1/2-mutant, 58.3% in the others, 36.3% in viral-infected, and 22.2% in KRAS-mutant, respectively (p = 0.05). Thus, our cohort suggests that IDH1/2, as well as KRAS mutations, have the potential to serve as prognostic biomarkers in ICC.Conclusion', ' We conclude that not only viral infections, but also IDH1/2 and KRAS mutations could be potential predictive markers for the identification of good and worse prognosis in ICCs. Hence the mutational profiles of these genes provide an attractive rationale for developing a molecular signature for the development of non-invasive screening for ICCs in future.']",

        "Background":"['Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) originates from biliary tract epithelium and can be classified anatomically into intrahepatic or extrahepatic CCA. Although a relatively rare disease in the United States and Europe, the incidence of intrahepatic CCA is on the rise with unknown causes. CCA incidence is higher in Asia and the etiology is associated with infections such as liver fluke and hepatitis B/C. Prognosis at diagnosis is poor with median survival time of < 1 year, and only 10-20% of patients are eligible for tumor resection at diagnosis. This study examined the prevalence of MET over-expression, activating single point mutations of KRAS and IDH1/2, and ROS1 gene fusions in 100 intrahepatic and extrahepatic CCA FFPE tumor tissues obtained from non-Asian (n=40) and Asian (n=60) patients. Immunohistochemistry performed with an anti-MET-specific antibody (A2) demonstrated that MET is expressed in the majority of all intrahepatic CCA samples analyzed, with 50% of samples reported with membranocytoplasmic scores of 2+ (moderate intensity) or 3+ (strong intensity) on a 0-3+ scale. Interestingly, most non-malignant bile ducts and much vascular endothelia also stained lightly positive for MET. To determine mutation frequencies of KRAS and IDH1/2, competitive allele-specific Taqman PCR (castPCR) was performed on DNA extracted from FFPE CCA tissue (limit of mutation detection 0.1%). Fourteen KRAS activating mutations (G12S, G12R, G12A, G13C, G13S, G13R, G12D, G13D, G12V, G12C, Q61R, Q61L, Q61H (c.183A>C and c.183A>T for Q61H), 5 IDH1 mutations (R132G, R132S, R132H, R132C, R132L), and 5 IDH2 mutations (R172G, R172M, R172K, R172W, R172S) were analyzed. Overall, 25% of analyzed samples were positive for KRAS mutation, and G12D was the predominant mutation (60%). One-third of Asian samples were positive for KRAS mutation, whereas less than one-fifth of non-Asian samples contained KRAS mutations. For IDH1, the frequency of mutation was less than 10% overall, and the majority of patients with IDH1 mutations were non-Asian. The R132C mutation was the predominant IDH1 mutation, and all tissues that were positive for IDH1 mutations were of intrahepatic origin. Interestingly, 2 out of the 7 samples positive for IDH1 mutations (R132C) were also positive for G12D KRAS mutation. There is no trend of MET expression correlating with either KRAS or IDH1 mutations. IDH2 analyses by castPCR and FISH studies examining ROS1 gene fusion are ongoing. Based on these data, inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases and their signaling pathways such as MET and ROS1 may merit clinical evaluation in CCA patients.

Methods', ' Sixty-six resected ICC tumor specimens were assessed for genetic alterations using next-generation sequencing of 410 cancer genes by Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT). We identified the gene alterations occurring with greatest frequency and grouped mutations by known cancer pathways and families, such as RAS-MAPK pathway, mTOR pathway, Notch signaling pathway, chromatin-remodeling gene family, and DNA repair gene family. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from time of resection until death and disease-free survival (DFS) was calculated from resection until recurrence or death.

As there are few in-vivo model systems for IDH-mutated tumors we have created a transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio) model expressing mutant IDH1. We have chosen the zebrafish as a model because they are transparent (allowing monitoring of the transgene in-vivo) and drug screening assays are straightforward (they are simply added to the aquarium).IDH1R132H and IDH1R132C, mutations found in tumors that both produce D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG) instead of alpha ketoglutarate, were cloned into an expression construct that is driven either by the Nestin or GFAP promoter. IDH1G70D (a loss of function mutation), IDH1wildtype and GFP were used as control. All IDH1 constructs were fused to GFP for visualization. These constructs were injected into fertilized zebrafish eggs at the one-cell stage.All of our transgenic zebrafish lines remain healthy and produce offspring. Transgene expression was detected in the mid/hindbrain of the central nervous system by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RT-QPCR. A significant increase in the level of D2HG was observed in all transgenic lines expressing IDH1R132C or IDH1R132H, but not in any of the lines expressing control constructs (IDH1wildtype, IDH1G70D or GFP). In contrast to reported, we failed to detect any differences in hydroxymethyl cytosine (the first step in DNA-demethylation) and mature collagen IV levels between wildtype and mutant IDH1 transgenic fish. We also performed microinjections on fertilized eggs to screen for early developmental effects of IDH1R132H and IDH1R132C. Despite of the high expression of the transgene, no developmental effects were found. Our observations therefore suggest that elevated levels of D2HG are insufficient to initiate tumorigenesis or other phenotypic effects in our fish. Treatment of the transgenic zebrafish with an IDH1 mutant inhibitor, AGI-5198, resulted in a reduction in the D2HG level in the mutant zebrafish. The L2HG level was not affected by AGI-5198. As no tumors were formed in our transgenic zebrafish lines, we backcrossed them with Tp53 mutant fish. Analysis of these lines is currently being performed.In summary, we have generated a transgenic zebrafish model system that expresses mutated IDH1 that can be used to study effects of mutant IDH1 (or elevated levels of D2HG) in vivo and can be used for drug screening.']",

Mutant IDH1 is a driver oncogene and the inhibition of this altered enzyme will decrease the growth of mIDH1 dependent tumors.We report for the first time the preclinical profile and structure of BAY 1436032, a novel selective mIDH1 inhibitor. An optimization program based on a high throughput screening resulted in the identification of the clinical candidate BAY 1436032 for the treatment of mIDH1 dependent cancer. BAY 1436032 is a double-digit nanomolar and selective pan-inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of various IDH1-R132X mutants in vitro and displayed potent inhibition of 2-HG release (nanomolar range) in patient derived and engineered cell lines expressing different IDH1 mutants. In line with the proposed mode of action, a concentration-dependent lowering of 2-HG was observed in vitro accompanied by differentiation and maturation of mIDH1 tumor cells. Furthermore, BAY 1436032 showed a favourable selectivity profile against wtIDH1/2 and a large panel of off-targets in vitro.To the best of our knowledge we were able to show for the first time single agent in vivo efficacy in mIDH1 patient derived glioma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma solid tumor models with this clinical candidate along with monitoring of intratumoral 2-HG levels as a predictive biomarker. The BBB penetration profile of BAY 1436032 is further supported by preclinical data on in vivo brain-plasma ratios.In conclusion, our data provide in vitro and in vivo proof of concept for BAY 1436032 as a potent and highly selective inhibitor of mutant forms of IDH1.

Results', ' Median age was 57 y (27-82); metastatic sites were liver (81%), nodes (43%) and lung (21%); median time to progression on first-line chemo was 5.1 months (m) (CI95% 4.1-6.3); 27% received 2 or more chemo lines. At least one ptGA was detected in 49% of the samples, with proportional increase according to the size and spectrum of gene alterations tested (p<0.001). Type of ptGA differed across tumor types (see Table). Additional ptGA in IHC (BRAF D594, ERBB2 S310, RNF43 and BRCA2 mut) and EHC (BRAF G469 and ERBB2 S310 mut) were found in single cases. A total of 22 pts were enrolled in Phase 1 trials, 13 of them with a direct MTT (5 PI3K, 2 MEK, 2 MET, 2 IDH1, 1 ERBB2 and 1 FGFR inhibitor [inh]). Partial response was observed in 1 case (MET ampl IHC with MET inh) and prolonged stable disease in 3 pts (1 FGFR2 fusion IHC with FGFR inh; 1 IDH1 mut IHC with IDH1 inh; 1 NRAS mut GBC with MEK inh). Conclusions', ' The diverse landscape of ptGA in BTC is a rich source for MTT in early clinical trials, and has the potential to improve outcomes of individual pts. Expanding gene panels to identify these driver alterations (mut, ampl and fusions) is key for precision medicine in BTC.

We hypothesized that delineation of different molecular alterations in the cancer types might potentially yield different therapeutic options.  Methods', '  815 cases (126 EHCC, 434 IHCC, 244 GBCA, 11 NOS) were tested by a commercial multiplatform profiling service (Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ). Tests included sequencing (Sanger, NGS), gene amplification (CISH/FISH), and protein expression (IHC). Results', '  24 of 47 genes tested had mutations, with the highest rates in TP53 (28%), KRAS (18%), IDH1 (9%), and SMAD4 (6%). BRCA1/2 mutations were seen in 3/41 (7.3%) and 5/40 (12.5%) cases. Overall,IHC showed high TOPO1, TOP2A, PD-1, SPARC and PD-L1 in 56%, 49%, 40%, 39% and 15% of cases and low RRM1, ERCC1 and TS in 82%, 72% and 79%, respectively, suggesting potential utility of chemotherapeutic and immunomodulatory agents targeting these alterations in selected cases. Mutually exclusive protein loss of chromatin modifiers BAP1 and PBRM1 were seen in 17% and 27%. ROS1 break-apart FISH showed negative results in 16 cases tested. Comparing the three carcinomas (EHCC, IHCC and GBCA, Table), EHCC had the highest KRAS mutation rate; IHCC had the highest IDH1 mutation; GBCA and EHCC had significantly higher TP53 mutation and HER2 amplification than IHCC.IDH1 and TP53 mutations were mutually exclusive, and IDH1-mutated IHCC had higher P-glycoprotein expression than TP53-mutated IHCC (82% vs. 37%).

AG-120 is a first-in-class, potent, oral inhibitor of mIDH1 tested in this phase I study in mIDH1 solid tumors, including CC. Methods', ' AG-120 was escalated in a 3+3 design from 100 mg twice daily to 1200 mg once daily (QD) in 28-day cycles (N = 60, mIDH1 advanced solid tumors). Key eligibility for CC', ' recurrence of progressive mIDH1 CC following standard therapy (dose escalation) or at least a prior gemcitabine-based regimen (expansion cohort).

        "Background":"['Primary liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Virus infection is the most common and strongest etiological factor for liver cancer development. Pathologically, primary liver cancer can be classified into 90% hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and 510% intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), and the combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC/CC) representing only a small portion. Clinically, ICC and cHCC/CC show much more aggressive behavior with poorer prognosis than HCC, and no standard treatment currently exists, other than surgical resection. ICC and cHCC/CC show varying degrees of biliary epithelial differentiation, which can be defined as liver cancer displaying a biliary phenotype (LCB). To gain insight into molecular alterations of LCBs, we performed whole genome sequencing analysis on 30 LCBs. Here we show the genome-wide substitution patterns of LCBs developed in chronic hepatitis livers overlapped with those of 60 HCCs, while those of hepatitis-negative LCBs diverged. The subsequent validation study on 68 LCBs identified recurrent mutations in TERT promoter, chromatin regulators (BAP1, PBRM1 and ARID2), a synapse organization gene (PCLO), IDH genes and KRAS. The frequencies of KRAS and IDHs mutations, which are associated with poor disease-free survival, were significantly higher in hepatitis-negative LCBs. This study reveals the strong impact of chronic hepatitis on the mutational landscape in liver cancer and the genetic diversity among LCBs.']",

        "Background":"['Poor differentiation (the divergence of tumor cell morphology from the cellular morphology of the normal tissue of origin) is associated with unfavorable responses to chemotherapy and poor clinical outcomes in solid tumors. Recurrent somatic mutations in the genes encoding for the metabolic enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 have recently been identified in patients with acute myeloid leukemias, chrondrosarcomas, cholangiocarcinomas and glioblastomas. Point mutations in IDH lead to production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). 2HG acts as a potent inhibitor of enzymes involved in the removal of chromatin marks associated with transcriptional repression (DNA and Histone H3K9 methylation). Excess 2HG leads to impaired differentiation but very little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Here we use a well established model of cellular differentiation, the differentiation of 10T1/2 fibroblasts into myofibers by the lineage-specifying transcription factor MyoD to study the mechanisms by which IDH mutations impair differentiation. We show that 5-azacytidine induced differentiation of 10T1/2 cells is impaired when mutant IDH2 is expressed and that IDH2 mutations impair the ability of MyoD expression to reprogram 10T1/2 cells into myofibers. We propose that the metabolic landscape of undifferentiated cells determines the ability of the lineage determining factor MyoD to trigger differentiation and that the undifferentiated state of cancer cells is dependent on their unique metabolic profile. Further work aims to a) define the effects of mutant IDH1/2 on the ability of MyoD to program muscle differentiation, b) determine the nature of the tumorigenic effects of IDH1/2 mutations in 10T1/2 cells and c) identify molecular pathways that can overcome differentiation blocks upon activation. Insight from these experiments will outline the mechanism(s) by which metabolic alterations, in the form of 2HG, impair differentiation and drive tumorigenesis. They will also serve as a platform for the identification of metabolic alterations that trigger differentiation. These mechanisms could prove to be novel and readily targetable processes in an array of poorly differentiated and aggressive cancer subtypes where other pharmacological approaches have failed.']",

Cancer is not a single disease but diseases of complex genetic components and oncogenic processes. Limited number of PDX models with minimal genetic characterization is insufficient to meet current research needs. For this, we have built the largest and most comprehensive PDX library with full genetic profiles. By far, our PDX library contains over 1,100 models derived from patients of both Asian and Western origins, covering over 20 major cancer types, including large panels (over 100 models each) of NSLCL(1), CRC(2), gastric(3), HCC(4), and pancreatic, and smaller panels (<100) of esophageal, H&N, ovarian, cholangiocarcinoma, breast, brain, etc. Our PDX models come with original patient and pathology diagnosis information, and verified at the level of histopathology and genetic fingerprints. These models have tumor growth and standard of care (SOC) treatment information. They are fully profiled using GeneChip based technology (U219, SNP6.0, miRNA), NGS (RNAseq and WES), and hotspot mutation, etc (HuPrime 1.0), with HLA typing readily available to enable immuno-oncology research. Comparing our PDXs genomic profiles with published patient genomic profiles in literature (4) and TCGA data source (Guo et al., 2015 AACR Annual) revealed high degree of similarity. Subsets of models have been comprehensively characterized for special relevance to specific clinical characteristics and specific drug targeting mechanisms (HuPrime 2.0). These subsets include all clinically observed EGFR mutated NSCLC(1, 5, 6); c-MET activation diseases(7); FGFR driven diseases; RET-fusion driven CRC(8); FLT3-LTD driven AML (9), IDH mutated AML(9) and CRC; RSPO-fusion driven CRC; BCL-ABL fusion disease, HER driven gastric and breast cancers, and ALK fusion NSCLC, etc. We have also established numeric drug resistant models to various SOCs of both chemotherapy and target therapies. The resistance could be de novo (1) or induced (10). These resistant models can be great tools to investigate drug resistant mechanisms and approaches to overcome them. Many PDXs can also been tested orthotopically, including liver, brain, colon, pancreatic, ovarian, and breast etc. Models have great metastatic potential have also been identified, enabling study metastatic mechanism and identifying agents to block the metastasis. A number of PDXs can grow in humanized mice (HuPrime 3.0), where human immunity has been reconstituted in the immune-compromised mouse background (11) to facilitate immune-oncology research.Our large library of different disease panels are particularly useful in conducting mouse clinical trial (MCT of HuTrialTM) (2, 5, 12), which can be used to discover predictive biomarker (2, 5, 13) and guide clinical study design.']",
