        "Background":"['BRAF V600E mutation happens in 60% of all melanomas cases and this mutation is responsible to poor prognosis of the disease. BRAF is part of the MAPK signaling pathway and the V600E mutation of BRAF confers full activation of this survival pathway. Several clinical trials are being conducted using mutated BRAF as a target but so far, all this trials works during a certain moment but soon, melanoma cells becomes resistant to treatment by activating some survival pathways that can continues the signal initialized in the MAPK pathway. Our objective is to evaluate if the combination of BRAF inhibitors and CDKs inhibitors can suppress the acquired resistance of V600E melanoma cells to BRAF inhibitors. Two melanoma cell lines were used in this study. The SKMel 28 cell line, which has BRAF V600E mutation, and the SKMel 02, which is wild type to BRAF. Olomoucine and Roscovitine were the CDKs inhibitors used in this study, while PLX-4720 was BRAF inhibitor. Western blot and Real time PCR were used to verify some survival pathways, like the MAP3K8 and the PRKD3 pathway, that are overexpressed after BRAF inhibition and MTT assay was used to verify cell viability with both treatments combined. The combination of Olomoucine and PLX-4720 or Roscovitine and PLX-4720 could sensitize the BRAF V600E mutated melanoma cell line SKMel 28, but not the BRAF wild type melanoma cell line SKMel 02. Two survival pathways (MAP3K8 and PRKD3) which are activated after BRAF inhibition by PLX-4720 were downregulated in the presence of the CDKs inhibitors in the SKMel 28 melanoma cell line. Also, the retinoblastoma protein was not phosphorylated when the SKMel28 melanoma cell line was treated with the BRAF inhibitor together with the CDKs. The treatment with the BRAF inhibitor and the CDKs inhibitors can sensitize BRAF V600E melanoma cells by decreasing cell viability, downregulation of survival pathways induced by the BRAF inhibitor and preventing Rb phosphorylation. This strategy may overcome the acquired resistance of BRAF-mutated melanoma after treatment with its inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['Mutations in the B-raf oncogene constitutively activate the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, a key regulator of cell proliferation and survival. The most common BRAF mutation (V600E) occurs in approximately 70% of primary melanomas and 10% of colorectal cancers. Melanoma patients carrying the BRAF(V600) mutation respond with frequency of 80% to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib, while colon cancer patients respond at a rate of 5% only, indicative of intrinsic resistance. Moreover, clinical benefit is further limited by the rapid emergence of acquired resistance among vemurafenib responders. Combination therapy targeting both BRAF(V600E) and possible escape pathways appears to be a promising approach to reverse resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Here, we present the molecular characterization and in vitro chemosensitivity profiles of 20 melanoma and 20 human colorectal cancer cell lines. Four of the colon and 11 of the melanoma cell lines were established at Oncotest from patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX). Molecular profiles include the mutation status of BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS, and NRAS (exon sequencing) and protein levels for components of the MAPK, EGFR and PI3K/AKT pathways (Western blot analysis). Sensitivity profiles for inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, EGFR and PI3K were determined in vitro using a fluorescence-based survival and proliferation assay. Overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors was investigated by combination of vemurafenib with other inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway or inhibitors of potential escape pathways like EGFR, PI3K/AKT or c-MET and evaluated by combination index according to Chou-Talalay.In line with the clinical situation, the BRAF V600E substitution was found in 13/20 (65%) of the melanoma and only in 4/20 (20%) of the colon cancer cell lines. BRAF and NRAS mutations were mutually exclusive in melanoma cell lines and KRAS mutations did not occur at all. Among the colon cancer cell lines, in addition to the BRAF(v600E) mutation, alteration in KRAS (10/20 cell lines), PIK3CA (6/20) and NRAS (1/20) were detected. Chemosensitivity profiling revealed intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors for 3/13 (23%) BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines and for 3/4 (75%) BRAF(V600E) colon cancer cell lines. Reversal of the resistance of BRAF inhibitor-insensitive melanoma cell lines was recorded as synergism between vemurafenib and inhibitors of vasious kinases (c-MET, AKT, PI3K, MEK, or EGFR. A particularly strong synergistic interaction was found for vemurafenib and the c-MET inhibitor SU11274, irrespective of BRAF status. For colon cancer cell lines, the strongest synergisms were detected for the combinations of vemurafenib with inhibitors of c-MET, EGFR, PI3K, AKT and MEK.Displaying similar mutation and chemosensitivity profiles as melanomas and colon cancers in the clinic, the present cell line panels represent valuable tools to investigate the reversal of resistance towards BRAF inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer and the leading cause of death from skin disease. The BRAF(V600E) mutation is found in approximately 60% of melanomas. It causes constitutive activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in these tumors leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Inhibition of BRAF(V600E) induces apoptosis in melanoma cells which has been used as the basis for molecular targeted therapy of melanoma. Small-molecule compounds such as Vemurafenib, Dabrafenib and other selective BRAF(V600E) inhibitors specifically bind BRAF(V600E), and have been shown to cause dramatic, but transient, tumor regression in vivo. The precise mechanisms of cell death following BRAF inhibition remain obscure; the literature posits a diversity of ways in which apoptosis is induced. However, it is unclear whether a single but complex network is involved or whether mechanisms differ from one cell type to the next. This is an important issue because use of BRAF(V600E) inhibitors in the treatment of melanoma is seriously challenged by the absence of durable responses; even in initially responsive patients tumors usually re-emerge within months and are observed to be drug resistant. An important challenge is thus to understand determinants of initial sensitivity to BRAF inhibition beyond V600E mutation and to determine which of these are involved in resistance.Using high throughput measurement of the abundance and state of modification of multiple proteins representing diverse signaling pathways at the basal level and over time in multiple melanoma cell lines exposed to different doses of BRAF inhibitors and data-driven mathematical modeling, we determine how the complex dynamics of signaling pathways are controlled in different cell lines and how drugs targeting BRAF(V600E) alter this signaling. Our analysis shows that the basal level of some proteins such as PTEN, pERK, pS6, pAkt, and -catenin vary up to 100-fold among different lines prior drug treatment. Further, these cell lines show different degrees of oncogene addiction and remarkable diversity with respect to the level of ERK inhibition and apoptosis as well as activation or inhibition of other signaling cascades following BRAF inhibition. We use mathematical modeling to relate basal levels of signaling proteins and their dynamics following BRAF inhibition to pharmacological descriptors of sensitivity to multiple BRAF drugs. Thus, we identify key signaling nodes within the signaling networks of the melanoma cells which determine the differential phenotypic consequences of BRAF inhibition. This approach will be critical for predicting and ultimately improving drug sensitivity in resistant tumors (e.g. via co-treatment strategies).']",

Methods', ' Pts with exhausted treatment options included in the Copenhagen Prospective Personalized Oncology (CoPPO) research program were selected for targeted therapy against actionable driver mutations identified in freshly obtained tumor biopsies by whole exome sequencing (Illumina HiSeq2500).

Results', ' Among 300+ patients included in the CoPPO research program, BRAF V600E mutations were identified in six patients with non-melanoma cancers who received targeted therapy (NSCLC, n = 1; bile duct cancer, n = 3; colon cancer, n = 2). Treatments included BRAF inhibitors (dabrafenib or vemurafenib) alone or in combination with MEK (trametinib) or EGFR inhibitors (panitumumab or cetuximab, colon cancer pts only). All pts but one had reductions in the size of target tumors. Two pts had partial responses as assessed by RECIST 1.1. The allele frequency of BRAF V600E increased within the first 24 hours after treatment initiation and subsequently decreased substantially. Dynamics of allele frequency correlated closely to treatment response. In all cases, timing of changes in allele frequency preceded documented radiological treatment response and/or progression. Analyses of tumor biopsies obtained post-treatment are ongoing.

Methods', ' We identified 132 patients with metastatic melanoma between 2011 and 2014 at our institution that had tumour tested for BRAF mutation using PCR. Of these, 122 cases were suitable for IHC.

The V600E BRAF mutant does not depend on RAS-dependent dimerization and is not susceptible to feedback inhibition of RAS. In V600E BRAF melanomas, ERK pathway output and the expression of ERK genes such as DUSP6 and members of the SPROUTY family are markedly elevated. In these tumors, RTK signaling and RAS activation are actively suppressed. In the context of elevated DUSP6, RAF inhibitors rapidly inhibit ERK phosphorylation and output. This relieves the feedback inhibition of various RTKs and induces RAS activity and the formation of activated wild type RAF dimers that are insensitive to RAF-inhibitors. This results in a rebound in ERK phosphorylation and output that is sensitive to MEK, but not RAF inhibitors and suggests that the latter cannot maximally inhibit ERK signaling in these tumors. In support of this idea, combined treatment with MEK and RAF inhibitors reduces ERK output and the growth of V600E BRAF melanoma xenografts to a greater degree than either alone.']",

Three NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines were also screened for HGF-mediated resistance to PD0325901.Results', ' Nine of thirteen V600E BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines were rescued from the effects of vemurafenib by co-treatment with HGF. Detailed analysis of G361 and SKMEL5 cells revealed that HGF was also capable of rescuing the cells from the effects of PD0325901. This HGF-mediated rescue was attenuated by treatment with combinations of vemurafenib + compound A or PD0325901 + compound A. Mechanistic cell cycle analysis of the HGF-mediated rescue of vemurafenib in G361 cells revealed an increase in proliferating cells and a reduction in growth arrested cells, whereas rescue of PD0325901 treatment occurred through a reduction in the percentage of dead or dying cells. Of the seven growth factors tested, HGF was the predominate growth factor capable of conferring resistance to vemurafenib. Furthermore, HGF rescued one of three NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines from the effects of PD0325901, highlighting the breadth of HGF-mediated resistance in melanoma cell lines.Conclusion', ' These findings demonstrate the potential role for HGF / MET signaling in mediating resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in melanoma, and support the clinical evaluation of MET kinase inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies to HGF in this setting.']",

        "Background":"['Activating BRAF(V600E) kinase mutations occur in 50% of melanoma, 45% of papillary thyroid cancer and 10% of colon cancer. BRAF inhibitors have elicited significant clinical response in melanomas but acquired resistance frequently develops after initial responses. Therefore, consideration of new treatment strategies to block activity of mutant BRAF and deter therapeutic resistance is warranted. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone required for the stability of hundreds of client proteins, including the RAF family of kinases, and has emerged as a highly relevant anticancer target. Ganetespib is a second generation, small molecule HSP90 inhibitor currently being evaluated in multiple clinical trials. To investigate the potential for ganetespib in the treatment of melanoma we evaluated its preclinical activity as monotherapy, and in combination with targeted agents, in cells sensitive or resistant to BRAF inhibitors. Ganetespib displayed potent anticancer activity in a large panel of BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma, thyroid and colon cancer cell lines, with IC50 between 4 and 40 nM. Further analysis showed that ganetespib disrupted oncogenic signaling by inducing the destabilization of mutant BRAF and subsequent inactivation of MEK and ERK. Levels of wild-type BRAF were only slightly reduced in response to ganetespib treatment, implying that the stability of activated BRAF is more reliant on HSP90 and that ganetespib may selectively deplete oncogenic forms of BRAF. Notably, ganetespib treatment also led to depletion of CRAF, which is implicated in driving therapeutic resistance to BRAF inhibitors. In an effort to maximize antitumor activity, we combined low levels of ganetespib with BRAF or MEK inhibitors in vitro and observed increased cytotoxicity compared to single agent treatment. Both the BRAF and MEK inhibitors were cytostatic on their own, which may be due to continued PI3K/mTOR signaling. We subsequently assayed the combination of ganetespib with a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor and observed synergistic increases in cell death. Importantly, ganetespib was capable of blocking the feedback activation on MAPKK induced by a MEK inhibitor as well as the activation of ERK by PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. To determine if these results translated in vivo, similar combinations were performed in BRAF mutant human melanoma xenografts. Co-administration of ganetespib with either a BRAF or PI3K/mTOR inhibitor suppressed in vivo tumor growth to a greater extent compared to monotherapy. Finally, we show that ganetespib effectively blocked MAPK signaling and killed RPMI-7951 melanoma cells (IC50 = 4 nM), which are resistant to BRAF and MEK inhibitors due to the overexpression of COT. In conclusion, targeting HSP90 with ganetespib represents a promising approach for the treatment of BRAF(V600E)-driven cancers and may be especially relevant in the context of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors.']",

This oncogenic mutation in the BRAF gene constitutively activates the MAPK signaling pathway and results in increased proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. BRAF V600E mutation was described in approximately 8% of all solid tumors (43% melanomas, 39-67% papillary thyroid carcinomas and 12% colorectal adenocarcinomas). However, it is challenging to identify patients with this mutation. Currently, the gold standard is sequencing of the tumor DNA, but this method is not practical for routine practice. In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a relatively easy diagnostic tool to detect proteins in paraffin-embedded tissues. The major goal of this study was to compare detection of BRAF V600E by sequencing and IHC using anti-BRAF V600E (VE1) antibody.

It was shown that BRAF V600E is a potent oncogene that activates the MAPK pathway and functions as a BRaf monomer. BRaf selective inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, which are effective in inhibiting the kinase activity of BRaf monomer, have demonstrated robust anti-tumor activities in BRAF mutant xenograft models and significant clinical benefit among BRAF mutant melanoma patients. In this study, we have identified and characterized novel BRaf aberrant variants, which have in-frame deletions within or adjacent to the L485-P490 region in patient samples and/or cell lines of lung, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. Tumor cells with these endogenous BRaf deletions are resistant to BRaf monomer inhibitor vemurafenib based on inhibition of phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK, cell proliferation, and cell cycle progression. However, these cells are sensitive to LY3009120, a pan Raf and Raf dimer inhibitor. Further analysis using siRNA showed that the MEK-ERK activity in these cells is mainly dependent on BRaf, not CRaf or ARaf. Ectopical expression of the L485-P490 deleted BRaf in mouse NIH3T3 cells is able to transform the cells and form colonies comparable to BRaf V600E mutation in three-dimensional soft agar growth. More importantly, the Raf dimer disrupting mutation BRafR509H abolished the transforming activity of the L485-P490 deleted BRaf, suggesting that this BRaf deletion functions as a dimer. Further, ectopical expression of the L485-P490 deleted BRaf promotes primarily BRaf homodimerization as revealed by proximity ligation assays (PLA). It was also confirmed by PLA that BRaf homodimer is the dominant form of Raf dimers in tumor cells harboring these BRaf deletions. In lung and pancreatic tumor xenograft models developed with tumor cells with these BRaf deletions, LY3009120 treatment demonstrated significant tumor growth inhibition and regression, whereas vemurafenib treatment showed no in vivo activity. Overall, we have identified novel oncogenic BRaf deletions that function as BRaf homodimer and are sensitive to pan Raf and Raf dimer inhibitor LY3009120.']",

Genomic DNA (gDNA) from fresh frozen tissue from 389 liver metastases and 6 primary tumors from 141 metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients as well as gDNA from 125 tumors from 75 malignant melanoma (MM) patients was available. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue from 285 of the CRC metastases from 123 patients were made. BRAF, exon 15 was amplified using the DyNazyme EXT polymerase system and sequenced by Sanger sequencing. IHC staining with the BRAF-VE1 antibody was performed on a Ventana BenchMark XT immunostainer. The intensity of staining was graded as 0 (no visible staining), grade 1 (weak diffuse background staining), 2 (moderate diffuse and granular) and 3 (strong granular staining). Grade 2 or 3 was regarded as positive. For high resolution melting analysis of V600-status, we used the LigthMix Kit BRAF V600E/K on a LightCycler 480 instrument.To establish the detection limits for the DNA-based methods used in this comparison, we analyzed a dilution series containing a ratio of 1', '1- 1', '107 BRAF V600E mutated DNA in BRAF wild-type DNA.

Since both BRAFi and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) kill sensitive melanoma cells by activating the BH3-only protein Bim, we examined whether they cooperate in killing of BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells. We show here that co-treatment with the HDACi SAHA and the BRAFi PLX4720 synergistically kills BRAF(V600E) melanoma cells in vitro, and that the combination of SAHA and the clinically available BRAFi vemurafenib cooperatively inhibits melanoma growth in vivo. Although SAHA plus PLX4720 activated the caspase cascade, the latter did not appear to be indispensable for induction of cell death. Likewise, PLX4720 alone kills sensitive melanoma cells in a caspase-independent manner. Similar to caspases, Bim seemed dispensable for synergistic killing by SAHA and PLX4720. The mechanism by which co-treatment with HDACi and BRAFi kills BRAFV600E melanoma cells remains to be elucidated, but we have found that this is not mediated by receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), which is essential for induction of programmed necrosis.

The discovery of constitutive activation of the BRAF kinase caused by activating BRAF(V600E) kinase mutation in most melanoma patients led to the discovery of the first potent BRAF(V600E) signaling inhibitor, vemurafenib. Vemurafenib was effective in treating advanced melanoma patients and was proposed for the treatment of other BRAF(V600E) mutant cancers as well. Unfortunately, the success of vemurafenib was hampered by the rapid development of acquired resistance in different types of BRAF(V600E) mutant cancer cells. It becomes important to identify and evaluate all of the potential mechanisms of cellular resistance to vemurafenib. In this study, we characterized the interactions of vemurafenib with three major ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2. We found that vemurafenib stimulated the ATPase activity and potently inhibited drug efflux mediated by ABCB1 and ABCG2. Vemurafenib also restored drug sensitivity in ABCG2-overexpressing cells. Moreover, we revealed that in the presence of functional ABCG2, BRAF kinase inhibition by vemurafenib is reduced in BRAF(V600E) mutant A375 cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that ABCG2 confers resistance to vemurafenib in A375 cells, suggesting involvement of this transporter in acquired resistance to vemurafenib.

Frequent mutations on BRAF gene have been detected in various types of human cancer, including malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, ovarian cancer and hairy cell leukemia. Among all, a single point 1799T>A (V600E) transversion, the most common mutation on BRAF, results in increased kinase activity. It serves as a driver mutation in several types of cancer and confers increased sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thus, detecting the BRAF V600E mutation may offer valuable information for cancer diagnosis, treatment selection, and prognosis. Here we report a rapid, highly sensitive method for the detection of BRAF V600 mutation using a bridged nucleic acid (BNA) clamp technology associated with quantitative PCR (qPCR). Due to the feature of enhanced affinity for hybridization template, BNA clamp is able to selectively block PCR reactions on the perfect match DNA sequence, while leaves the mismatch template unaffected. In this study several BNA clamps that bind to BRAF V600 wild-type (WT) template was designed, synthesized, and characterized. As compared to DNA clamp counterparts, these BNA clamps increased Tm values for the BRAF V600 WT by greater than 30C. In addition, BNA clamps efficiently distinguished BRAF WT (perfect match) from V600E (mismatch) templates (deltaTm >12C). In qPCR assays BNA clamps could suppress amplification of WT by >1,000-fold, while had little or no effects on the V600E mutant. Such BNA clamps allowed us to detect 1.0% or lower levels for the BRAF V600E mutant in a wild-type background. These results indicate that BNA clamp-based qPCR technology offers a new tool for rapid, sensitive detection of BRAF V600E mutation.

This pathway can further activate downstream the p90- ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK). OBJECTIVES.- Since BRAF mutations increase melanoma progression which could lead to metabolic stress when oxygen, glucose, and other nutrients are limiting within poorly vascularized regions, we investigated whether hypoxia and metabolic stress can differentially influence the survival of human melanoma cells harbouring either wt or oncogenic BRAF. EXPERIMENTAL. human melanoma cells with unequal BRAF status were exposed to glucose and/or glutamine limitations under normoxia or hypoxia. Relative metabolic activity was fluorometrically quantitated by the cellular conversion of resazurin to resorufin. Differential cell survival was assesed by crystal violet staining. Mechanisms influencing the response to metabolic stress were studied by specific immune blotting. RESULTS. the metabolic activity and survival of melanoma cells harbouring oncogenic BRAF was preferentially decreased under hypoxia at sub-physiological glucose, compared to wt BRAF melanoma cells. Addition of the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine or pyruvate enhanced the metabolic activity and survival of wt BRAF cells, but these were much less effective when added to BRAF (V600E) mutant cells, implying a greater oxidative stress induced by low oxygen and glucose in them. Susceptibility to metabolic stress under hypoxia and low glucose in BRAF (V600E) mutant cells, correlated with persistent (p90RSK) activation but lower GLUT-1 and MnSOD expression. In contrast, wt BRAF melanoma cells resistant to metabolic stress reciprocally showed higher GLUT-1 and MnSOD expression, but negligible p90RSK activation. CONCLUSION.- Although mutations in BRAF can drive acquired resistance to MEK1/2 inhibitors, our results suggest that restricting glucose consumption in hypoxic melanomas harbouring mutant BRAF with persistent phosphorylation of the p90-ribosomal S6 kinase, may contribute to their preferential killing.']",

        "Background":"['Epigenetic changes in cancer are thought to contribute to regulation of invasion and metastasis. To study this at a genome-wide level in melanoma we analyzed the methylome of 44 cases of malignant melanoma with the HELP (HpaII tiny fragment enriched by LM-PCR) assay and compared it to melanocyte controls. We saw widespread demethylation in melanoma occurring preferentially outside of CpG islands. Comparison of primary and metastatic lesions demonstrated that demethylation occurs early during carcinogenesis with few additional alterations in advanced tumors. Parallel transcriptomic analysis revealed many known and novel oncogenic pathways aberrantly expressed and regulated by loss of DNA methylation.The colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) was aberrantly expressed and hypomethylated in nearly all cases. The expression of CSF1R was validated by immunohistochemistry on primary tumors and by Western blotting in BRAF V600E mutant and WT melanoma cell lines. Expression of its ligand IL34, but not of CSF1 was also shown in the melanoma cells by both ELISA and qPCR. The effects of a small molecule inhibitor, PLX3397 as well as shRNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor were investigated in traditional and 3D cell culture. We saw inhibition of cell growth, smaller colony size, increased apoptosis and decreased invasiveness - suggesting a functional role for CSF1R in melanoma.Treatment of melanoma with small molecule inhibitors of BRAF V600E is effective for a time, but resistance invariably develops. The feedback activation of EGFR, BRAF amplification, BRAF splice variants and others are known to aid in the acquisition of resistance and lead to rebound activation of the MAPK-pathway. In Western blotting experiments, the rebound of ERK phosphorylation after BRAF inhibitor treatment was accelerated with the addition of the CSF1R ligands CSF1 and IL34, or delayed with PLX3397, also attenuating AKT phosphorylation. Melanoma cells stably expressing CSF1R shRNA recapitulated the effects of the inhibitor. Assaying the cells at different time points during a long-term V600E inhibitory experiment, we saw increasing levels of the transcription factor RUNX1, followed by increasing levels of IL34 and of the CSF1R protein, as well as its maturation, evidenced by the appearance of the high MW form. Utilizing shRNA-mediated knockdown of RUNX1 resulted in lower levels of the CSF1R and IL34 transcripts and delayed the rebound. Analysis of primary RNA-Seq data showed an increase in RUNX1, CSF1R and IL34 expression as resistance was acquired. Co-inhibition of CSF1R and BRAF was also tested and resulted in synergistic blockade of cell growth in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo. The CSF1R inhibitor, PLX3397, is in clinical trials for breast and other cancers, and these data present a preclinical rationale for its study in malignant melanoma.']",

Intrinsic and acquired resistance to BRAF V600E targeted therapies (BRAFi) in metastatic melanoma patients further underscores the need for global profiling of melanoma circuitry at the functional level. Therefore, activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) and phosphoproteomics was carried out to decipher steady state differences in global signaling mechanisms in nave and BRAFi resistant melanoma cell lines with BRAF V600E mutations.Four cell lines (A375, 1205Lu, WM164 and WM793) were selected to evaluate different molecular backgrounds of BRAF mutation based on their PTEN status (either WT or null). For each cell type, both the nave and BRAFi resistant lines were analyzed via ABPP as well as chemical labeling with tandem mass tags (TMT) prior to discovery phosphoproteomics. While the ABPP approach mined for kinases, phosphoproteomics identified STY phosphorylated peptides providing information on signaling via kinase substrates. LC-MS/MS discovery proteomics (RSLC and Q Exactive, Thermo) identified and relatively quantified all peptides observed in ABPP and TMT phosphoproteomics experiments. MaxQuant was used for data evaluation; preliminary statistical analyses were performed in Perseus to select significant differences for pathway mapping (GeneGO, Metacore) and follow up experiments using siRNA or pharmacological inhibition. Adaptive responses to combination treatment were also explored using the SysQuant workflow for quantitative expression analysis and phosphoproteomics. These experiments served as a basis for comparison for a pilot project of 12 metastatic tumors from BRAF mutant melanoma patients selected for comparison of good and poor survival outcomes.ABPP measurements on different cell line models (A375, 1205Lu, WM793 and WM164) reveal significant differences in ATP uptake of proteins in the resistant cell line model compared to its nave counterpart. For example, in the 1205Lu cell line several proteins including EGFR, p38alpha, DNA-PK formed an interconnected pathway. Overall we identified between 2,000-2,800 proteins in each cell line with 150 kinases. Isobaric labeling coupled to phosphoproteomics identified 1,600 quantifiable proteins with 4,000 phosphorylation sites. Phosphoproteomics revealed concomitant increase in phosphorylation levels of the substrates acted upon by kinases showing higher ATP uptake in ABPP measurements. For example, in 1205Lu BRAFi resistant cells, CDK1, CDK2 and DNA-PK showed higher ATP uptake and their substrates SSK1, DPYSL3, and vimentin showed higher phosphorylation levels.The complementary nature of the two functional proteomics approaches provided holistic overview of signalling network in melanoma and enabled selection of targets for follow-up studies.']",

Combination treatment with MEK inhibitor GDC-0973 results in a highly significant enhancement of efficacy across all twenty lines tested.

        "Background":"['Autophagy is a homeostatic process of cellular self-digestion and is an adaptive therapy resistance mechanism in cancer. Emerging studies indicate that autophagy is involved in secretion through non-classical mechanisms. It is not well understood, however, how this secretory function modifies the molecular composition of the tumor secretome, which plays an important role in tumor growth and tumor immune responses. In this work, we focused on the role of both basal and BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi)-induced autophagy in melanoma cells harboring BRAF V600E, a missense mutation observed in 60% of melanoma tumors. Using quantitative proteomics we previously showed that a small number of proteins were differentially secreted by low and high autophagy melanoma cells grown in three-dimensional culture. Secreted proteins associated with high autophagy included IL-1, IL-8, LIF, FAM3C, and DKK3, which have known roles in tumorigenesis. Further, serum collected from untreated metastatic melanoma patients with high tumor autophagy levels exhibited higher levels of these proteins than serum from low autophagy patients. In the current study, melanoma cells with high autophagy and the BRAF V600E mutation (1205Lu) were treated with the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720, the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), PLX4720+HCQ, and the autophagy inducer rapamycin. The increase in autophagic flux upon the addition of PLX4720 or rapamycin was confirmed by western blotting and tandem fluorescently tagged LC3 (mCherry-eGFP-LC3). Secretomes were compared using quantitative proteomics, which resulted in identification of 1154 proteins with a false discovery rate of less than 1%. Hierarchical clustering and principal components analysis showed that secretomes from cells treated with the autophagy inducers rapamycin or PLX4720 correlated more closely with each other than those treated with HCQ either alone or in combination. A panel of proteins involved in extracellular matrix modification, cell-cell adhesion, and inflammation (including FAM3C and LIF) significantly increased in the supernatants of cells treated with PLX4720 or rapamycin and decreased in supernatants from cells treated with HCQ or HCQ+PLX4720. These results demonstrate that autophagy plays an active role in modifying the molecular composition of the tumor secretome. Proteins specifically shed in response to BRAF inhibitors and/or autophagy inhibition may have utility in the clinic for diagnostic and pharmacodynamic applications.']",

        "Background":"[\"More than 50% of melanoma's harbor the V600E activating mutation in BRAF, which constitutively activates the Mek/Erk signaling cascade leading to tumor cell proliferation. The BRAF(V600E) mutation predicts responsiveness to RAF inhibitors, which led to FDA approval of the RAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) in 2011. Although several mechanisms of resistance to RAF inhibition have been described, no resistance-associated point mutations involving the RAF genes themselves have been detected in the clinical setting thus far. This is in contrast to well described resistance mechanisms to receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which frequently involve secondary mutations within the target kinase. To gain additional insights in this regard, we created randomly mutagenized cDNA library of BRAF (V600E) and it's homolog C-RAF and expressed individually in A375(V600E B-RAF) cells in the presence of PLX4720, an analogue of PLX4032. The resistance clones emerged from the screen were characterized by massive parallel sequencing and the mutant alleles were further recreated via site directed mutageneis in the respective cDNA's. However, no candidate mutations occuring in BRAF (V600E) could be validated as bona fide resistance alleles. In contrast, we identified 11 alleles that engendered sustained Mek phosphorylation in the setting of PLX4720 exposure. Upon ectopic expression, three of these alleles conferred profound pharmacologic resistance to PLX4720. Two of these resistance alleles clustered within the 14-3-3 consensus binding site of C-RAF, and the third occurred in the kinase domain (ATP binding domain, activation segment). 14-3-3 proteins are known to stabilize and activate C-RAF through phosphorylation of key serine and tyrosine residues. Toward this end, some C-RAF resistance alleles promoted increased BRAF heterodimerization and increased kinase activity. Each of these alleles remained sensitive to the Mek inhibitor AZD6244. On the basis of these findings, we speculate that mutations in C-RAF that alter 14-3-3 binding, promoted dimerization, and/or enhance intrinsic kinase activity may conceivably mediate resistance to RAF inhibition - particularly as more potent inhibitors become utilized. Ongoing work involves investigating the clinical relevance of this phenomenon.\"]",

Aberrant signalling via the MAPK pathway is commonly seen in cancer. RAF inhibitors such as Dabrafenib and Vemurafenib have been approved for the treatment of unresectable and metastatic BRAF mutant melanoma, but these agents lack efficacy in BRAF mutant colorectal cancer (CRC), partly because of EGFR-mediated feedback reactivation of the MAPK pathway via CRAF. Furthermore, RAF inhibitor treatment of RAS-mutant, BRAF wildtype melanomas has been associated with other skin cancers, such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma due to MAPK pathway paradoxical activation mediated by CRAF. There is therefore a clinical need for novel agents targeting the MAPK pathway that do not have these undesirable properties. Here we present, REDX05358 that demonstrates subnanomolar binding affinity for BRAF and CRAF with high selectivity profile against a panel of 468 kinases that exhibits negligible paradoxical activation due to inhibition of both RAF monomers and dimers.

We report here that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), neuregulin-1 (NRG1), and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) cause robust resistance in vitro to BRAF or MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines. NRAS mutant lines were similarly resistant to MEK inhibition in the presence of these growth factors. By contrast other mitogenic factors such as PDGF, EGF, NGF, BDNF, MSP, MDK, GRO, and IGF1 did not maintain cell viability or growth. HGF, NRG1 and FGF2 prevented growth arrest and cell death and in some cell lines maintained cells in progressive growth. In addition, HGF and NRG1 could prevent growth arrest after dual treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Western analysis revealed that HGF and NRG1 reactivated Erk signaling and activated S6RP and AKT phosphorylation. Combined pharmacological inhibition mTor signaling and Akt signaling was required to fully block growth factor-mediated proliferation. In addition, small molecule Met inhibitors and an anti-HGF antibody blocked HGF-mediated resistance, while lapatinib and an anti-NRG1 antibody blocked NRG1-mediated resistance. While combined Akt and mTor inhibition potently inhibited cell line growth independent of BRAF or MEK inhibition, lapatinib and Met inhibitors had minimal effect on growth, suggesting potential for less adverse events with receptor inhibitors. In vitro co-culture experiments revealed that primary cells present in normal skin can cause resistance, and we have identified growth factors produced by these cells that contribute to resistance. We are analyzing receptor activation (Met and Erbb3) and FGF2 expression in wildtype, NRAS, and BRAF mutant primary melanoma samples.

PDGFR inhibition by PDGFR-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNAs) and by clinically available PDGFR inhibitors (sunitinib, imatinib and crenolanib) restores and increases melanoma cells' sensitivity to BRAF-I in vitro and in vivo. This effect reflects the inhibition of ERK and AKT activation which is associated with BRAF-I resistance of melanoma cells. PDGFR up-regulation is mediated by Sonic Hedgehog Homolog (Shh) pathway activation which is induced by BRAF-I treatment. Similarly to PDGFR inhibition, Shh inhibition by the novel small molecule LDE225 restores and increases melanoma cells' sensitivity to BRAF-I in vitro and in vivo. These effects are mediated by PDGFR down-regulation and by inhibition of ERK and AKT activation. The clinical relevance of these data is indicated by the association of PDGFR up-regulation in melanoma matched biopsies of BRAF-I +/- MEK inhibitor treated patients with shorter time to disease progression and less tumor regression. These findings suggest that monitoring patients for early PDGFR up-regulation will facilitate the identification of those who may benefit from the treatment with BRAF-I in combination with clinically approved PDGFR or Shh inhibitors\"]",

Methods', '  BRAF mutant (mu) cell lines were created by transfection of BRAF V600E constructs into BRAF wild type (wt) cell lines. Anti-tumor activity of E7080 alone or in combination with the selective BRAF inhibitor PLX-4032 was examined in xenografted models bearing mock and BRAFmu transfectants.  Results', '  The ratio of ANGPT1/2 expression was significantly higher in BRAFmu/ PTENwt compared to BRAFwt/PTENwt and BRAFmu/PTENmu among 14 melanoma cell lines. ANGPT1 expression was up-regulated in BRAFmu by 330%, and ANGPT2  in PTENmu by 290% compared to wt. PLX-4032 decreased ANGPT1 expression and pericyte coverage of tumor vessels in BRAFmu/PTENwt A375 melanoma. Similarly, overexpression of BRAF V600E in BRAFwt SK-MEL-2 melanoma resulted in increased ANGPT1 expression along with increased pericyte coverage. E7080 at 3, 10, 30 to 100 mg/kg showed significant anti-tumor activity against mock transfectants, but only at 100 mg/kg against BRAF V600E transfectants. Combination of E7080 at 10 mg/kg with PLX-4032 at 100 mg/kg showed synergistic anti-tumor activity against A375 melanoma and caused tumor regression, not observed by either single agent E7080 or PLX-4032. E7080 alone increased pericyte coverage of tumor vessels, but in combination with PLX-4032 resulted in marked decreased in pericyte coverage and microvessel density.  Conclusions', '  The BRAFmu/ PTENwt melanomas studied demonstrate high pericyte coverage and resistance to E7080.   Combination of E7080 with PLX-4032 achieves synergistic antitumor effect with enhanced reduction of pericyte coverage.

        "Background":"['The BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, has been proven to be efficacious for the treatment of melanomas harboring (V600E) mutation. While the response rate is high, resistance is inevitable. The response to salvage therapy is poor. While the MEK inhibitor may be able to enhance anti-tumor efficacy of vemurafenib, but patients eventually relapse. Hence, there is an urgent need for second line treatment for melanoma patients who fail vemurafenib treatment.In this study, we discovered that BRAF inhibitor-resistant (BR) melanoma cells are exquisitely sensitive to arginine deprivation. Arginine deprivation was achieved using arginine degrading enzyme (pegylated arginine deiminase, ADI-PEG20, kindly provided by Polaris). ADI-PEG20 has been shown to induce autophagy in primary melanoma culture derived from patients whose tumors do not express argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS). Apoptosis does occur when these cells are exposed longer (5-7 days) and at higher doses. Inducible ASS expression upon arginine deprivation also impedes the antitumor effect of ADI-PEG20. We have found that BR cells from MEL-1220 (derived from patient with V600E and ASS (-)), A375, and A2058 cells (inducible ASS) cultured in the presence of vemurafenib at IC50 over 20 weeks had non-inducible ASS expression. MTT and Annexin V/PI analyses showed that ADI-PEG20 induced 3-6 fold increase in apoptosis and growth inhibition in BR cells compared to parental cells following 3-day incubation. These results were further confirmed by increased active (cleaved) form of caspase-3 as detected by western blotting after the addition of ADI-PEG20. The mouse xenograft model also verified that ADI-PEG20 abolished tumor growth of A2058BR cells while only retardation of growth seen in A2058 cells (the reduction rate of tumor volume is 92% vs. 63%). We found that two vital autophagic proteins (Beclin1 and ATG5) decreased in resistant cells after treatment with ADI-PEG20, which might explain the inability to undergo autophagy upon arginine deprivation as a survival mechanism and re-directing the cells toward apoptosis. The other mechanism leading to non-inducible ASS expression is c-Myc degradation. It has been proven that c-myc is a positive regulator in ASS transcription, and c-Myc stability is governed by ubiquitination. By immunoprecipitation assay, we found that BR cells had lower levels of deubiquitinating enzyme USP28, and hence cannot prevent c-Myc from ubiquitin-dependent prosteasomal degradation. Therefore, our results demonstrated that BRAF inhibitor resistance suppresses c-Myc-mediated ASS transcription and in turn increases sensitivity to ADI-PEG20.In conclusion, ADI-PEG20 appears to be a good candidate for targeted therapy for melanoma patients who have tumor recurrence or disease progression after vemurafenib treatment.

It is especially prevalent in malignant melanoma, where it occurs in 40-60% of the cases. The most common BRAF mutation is the valine to glutamate substitution at position 600 of the kinase (V600E). This substitution, seen in ninety percent of the BRAF cases, leads to constitutive activation of the kinase, and the downstream MEK-ERK pathway. Appropriately, several drugs have been designed to inhibit BRAF, with a broad range of outcomes in clinical trials. Unfortunately, all patients, including those showing complete responses, develop resistance to single agent therapy. Our goal is to come up with effective drug combinations that would delay, or even prevent, the cancer from becoming resistant to treatment.We used a panel of 43 melanoma lines, comprising of 28 BRAF mutants, 12 NRAS mutants and 3 lines that were wild type for these two genes. Besides BRAF and NRAS, we have the mutational status of 65 other commonly mutated cancer genes for all the lines. We assembled a set of 25 drugs targeting a wide range of proteins, including PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, the apoptosis machinery, as well as some epigenetic modulators. The melanoma lines were treated with these drugs, either (i) alone or (ii) in combination with the B-RAF inhibitor vemurafenib or (iii) in combination with the MEK inhibitor Selumetinib, for 72 hrs over a nine point, 256-fold concentration range.

Results', ' Before vemurafenib treatment, the patient had subtotal bone marrow infiltration and massive splenomegaly (24.8 x 8.3 cm) leading to severe cytopenia (leukocytes 680/l, hemoglobin 10.0 g/dl, platelets 36.000/l). Treatment with vemurafenib was started with 240 mg twice daily and was slowly escalated to 1920 mg/d.  Within two days of treatment, the spleen softened and decreased in size. Serum CD25 (sCD25) level fell rapidly from 24.800 U/ml to normal levels (<900), and platelets, hemoglobin, and leukocyte counts rose. After 16 days of vemurafenib treatment, the spleen size had shrunk to 14 x 5 cm. By day 28 of treatment (on 720 mg/d), platelet counts and sCD25 levels had normalized.

However, there is considerable variability in both the extent and the duration of patient responses, and acquired resistance invariably emerges. To date, a number of mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors have been identified, most of which reactivate ERK signaling while simultaneously engaging parallel survival pathways. However, these mechanisms account for only a fraction of progressed melanoma and do not explain the large variability of initial response rates and time to progression of melanoma patients subjected to these therapies. We hypothesize that in addition to genetic events, non-genetic alterations such as microRNA changes are critical in mediating time to progression in melanoma tumors treated with BRAF inhibitors. In order to identify microRNAs involved in BRAF inhibitor resistance we performed a functional screen approach utilizing a novel lentiviral-based library of microRNA decoys. These constructs are better able to stably suppress endogenous microRNA activity than the hairpin RNAs traditionally used. This pooled parallel loss-of-microRNA function analysis in BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma cells showed enrichment and loss of specific decoys after drug treatment, corresponding to microRNAs that may enhance or compromise the response, respectively. MicroRNA decoys that are positively or negatively selected during drug treatment are being validated using single decoy constructs for their ability to modulate BRAFi response. MicroRNA target genes will be determined by a combination of microarray analysis, in silico predictive algorithms, and 3UTR-luciferase reporter assay. MicroRNAs and target genes are being validated on human samples from treated patients. Those potentially involved in processes/pathways known to influence drug resistance (i.e. survival genes) will be examined for their ability to mimic or counteract microRNA effects in BRAFi resistance when silenced or overexpressed, respectively.

In particular, one of the three isoforms of RAF, BRAF, presents activating somatic mutations in 60% of melanomas, 50% of thyroid cancers, 10% of colon and 20% ovarian carcinomas.

        "Background":"['Dysregulation of ERK signaling is a common event in malignancy. Receptor activation of RAS leads to dimerization and activation of RAF kinase, which in turn activates ERK. Physiologic activation of the pathway is limited by ERK dependent feedback inhibition of RAS activation and other components of the pathway. Oncogenic mutations and translocations of RAF family members have been identified in many human tumors and serve as drivers of tumor growth. We now show that these mutants are active despite feedback inhibition of RAS and that this is associated with dysregulated ERK output. All translocations and almost all of the RAF mutants tested so far form RAS-independent constitutive dimers, the activity of which is dependent on their dimerization. Mutations at one site, V600E and V600K allow RAF to function as a monomer in cells with low RAS activity and as a RAS-dependent dimer in cells with adequate RAS activity. In tumors expressing any of these mutants, RAF/MEK/ERK activity is elevated despite feedback inhibition of RAS. Currently available RAF inhibitors bind to one protomer of the RAF dimer and cause negative cooperativity of binding to the second site. This is sometimes associated with transactivation of the unbound protomer. These inhibitors cannot be used to inhibit ERK signaling in tumors in which ERK is driven by RAF-dimers (those with mutant RAS, NF1 loss, atypical RAF mutations, RAF translocations.) In contrast, in tumors with V600E BRAF mutations, ERK causes strong feedback inhibition of RAS and V600E BRAF exists as a monomer that is inhibited by these drugs. Acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors usually results from a molecular lesion that causes RAS-dependent or independent dimerization of V600E (NRAS mutation, V600E BRAF amplification, V600E aberrantly spliced isoform.) Current RAF inhibitors inhibit V600E BRAF dimers at concentrations 10-100 fold greater than those required to inhibit the corresponding monomer in cells. We take this as a provisional measure of the degree of negative cooperativity of binding to the second site. We have now identified inhibitors that inhibit V600E dimers at concentrations close (1-3 fold higher) than those required to inhibit the monomer. They do not cause dissociation of dimers and their inhibition is abolished by gatekeeper mutations. Phenotypically, therefore, binding of these compounds to dimers is associated with only minimal negative cooperativity. These drugs inhibit ERK signaling and the proliferation of tumor cells with atypical BRAF mutations and translocations as well as V600E melanoma models with acquired resistance to Vemurafenib. However, they are much less active in cancer cells with KRAS mutation or receptor-dependent activation of RAF. Selective inhibitors of subsets of RAF dimers may allow effective ERK inhibition of large subset of tumors without inhibiting signaling in normal cells.']",

Methods', ' The oncocarta mutation panel was used to assess muations in 31 melanoma lines and short-term cultures.

Results', ' There were 7 lines with no detectable mutations, 10 with mutations in NRAS or KRAS,13 with BRAF mutations and one with mutated cKit.Apoptosis induction was highest in the lines with mutated BRAF and correlated inversely with cell viability except for 2 lines with mutated CDK4 (R24c) which had low viability and low apoptosis.Inhibition of caspases indicated that apoptosis was the main mechanism for reduced cell viabilty. Induction of apoptosis correlated with upregulation of the proapoptotic BH3 protein Bim as reported in previous studies on the MEK inhibitor UO126. In particular there was selective upregulation of the short form of Bim and this correlated with induction of apoptosis. There were no significant changes in the the other BH3 only proteins PUMA or NOXA Combination of a MEK inhibitor with the BRAF inhibitor had strong potentiating effects on cell lines that were relatively resistant to the BRAF inhibitor. Conclusions', ' These studies confirm that the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 induces apoptosis in human melanoma with mutated BRAF at concentrations achievable in vivo. Melanoma lines with mutated CDK4 or EGRF receptors had lower cell viability.

The V600E mutation is found in the vast majority of these cases and is an activating mutation, conferring transforming and immortalization potential to cells. CEP-32496 is a potent BRAF inhibitor that demonstrates selective anti-tumor activity against BRAFV600E mutated cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. CEP-32496 is orally bioavailable and demonstrates in vivo pharmacodynamic inhibition of pMEK and pERK signaling and tumor stasis and regressions in BRaf V600E cell line tumor xenograft models. In the current study Champions primary human TumorGraft models of melanoma and colorectal carcinoma possessing the B-Raf V600E genotype were utilized to determine the oral anti-tumor efficacy of CEP-32496 in more clinically relevant models in order to support the clinical development of CEP-32496. Champions Oncology has developed an innovative platform for oncology research that utilizes the implantation of primary human tumors in immune-deficient mice in a manner that preserves the biological properties of the original human tumor. Previous reports have demonstrated the correlation between the responses observed in Champions TumorGraft models and clinical responses from the patients from which the models were derived. CEP-32496 was evaluated in a panel of nine Champions TumorGraft models and compared to the recently FDA-approved B-RAF inhibitor, vemurafenib (Roche/Genentech/Daiichi) in order to determine the potential clinical activity of the compound.

Additional TumorGraft models are currently under evaluation and retrospective bioinformatics analyses are planned to determine potential signatures of response and resistance for CEP-32496 to facilitate both its clinical development and potential differentiation from vemurafenib.

In cell lines with rare BRAF mutations, we investigated the effect of Vem, inhibitors of Pan-RAF (Amgen 2112819), MEK (trametinib), ERK (MERK SCH772984), Pan-RAFi+ MEKi and ERKi+Vem on growth and signaling. These results were compared to the clinical responses to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in patients with the original tumors. Regardless of the mutation, no paradoxical activation of MAPK pathway by Vem was observed and the Pan-Rafi decreased levels of pMEK in all the cell lines. A heterozygous V600K mutated cell line was sensitive to Vem and more sensitive to the other drugs. Clinically, the duration of response to Vem in the patient the cell line was derived from was 7 months, and an additional 3 months to the combination of Vem and MEKi upon progression on Vem. In contrast, a homozygous V600K mutated cell line was resistant to Vem but sensitive to other MAPK inhibitors. The patient the cell line was derived from had a 5 month response to Vem followed by a 2 month response to the addition of a MEKi. BRAF L597S cell line was only sensitive to ERKi and G466K and V600R mutated cell lines were resistant to all the drugs. In general, Vem was the least effective followed by Pan-RAFi with ERKi stronger than both in most cell lines. The combination of Vem and ERKi showed similar or slightly higher growth inhibition than ERKi alone.

Although tumors in patients frequently shrink significantly within weeks of initiation of treatment, resistance eventually develops in many patients, with a median progression free survival of approximately 7 months.

A better in vivo understanding of the effects of BRAF inhibitor-treatment of relevant mouse models may yield insights into the nature of the clinical response and subsequent relapse. The conditional BRAF/PTEN mouse model of melanoma that we co-developed is ideal to study this process. In this non-xenograft model, expression of BRAF V600E and loss of PTEN is under control of the Cre-Lox recombination system. Expression of the Cre recombinase is under control of the tyrosinase promoter, ensuring that recombination is limited to melanocytes. The Cre recombinase is fused to an estrogen receptor that inhibits the activity of the recombinase. Activation of the Cre recombinase requires topical application of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, allowing for induction of recombination at specific time points in the life span of the mouse. The use of this mouse model allows for more thorough evaluation of the time course and phenotype of BRAF-inhibitor response in melanoma in an immunocompetent host.

We recently characterized a romidepsin-resistant T-cell lymphoma cell line that was found to have activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, leading to subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of the proapoptotic protein Bim, suggesting that activation of this pathway may also confer resistance to romidepsin and other HDIs. The V600E BRAF mutation has been found in approximately 60% of melanomas and approximately 15% of colon cancers and leads to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. We thus hypothesized that combined treatment with romidepsin and BRAF or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors may be effective in cancers that harbor the V600E BRAF mutation. To more closely simulate clinical administration of romidepsin, 11 V600E BRAF mutant cell lines (8 melanomas and 3 colorectal cancers) were exposed to 25 ng/ml romidepsin for 6 h after which romidepsin was removed, cells were incubated in fresh medium for an additional 42 h and subsequently apoptosis was measured by Annexin V and propidium iodide staining. Of the 11 cell lines, 10 exhibited significantly higher annexin staining after short-term romidepsin treatment (control 7.1%  3.8% vs. treated 34.7%  17.8%, p<0.001). Cells were subsequently treated with medium containing 25 ng/ml romidepsin with 250 nM of the MEK inhibitors AZD6244 (selumetinib) and PD0325901 or 1 M of the mutant BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 (vemurafenib) for 6 h, after which the cells were incubated an additional 42 h in medium containing the inhibitors alone. Combined treatment with romidepsin and AZD6244 resulted in a significantly higher percent of annexin positive cells (p<0.05) in 9 of the 11 BRAF mutant cell lines examined. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated inhibition of the MAPK pathway at the concentrations used and that apoptosis was associated with increased expression of Bim, as well as increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage.

In more than 90% of the cases, these mutations are located in the BRAF V600 codon (V600E and V600K). Targeted therapies like vemurafenib and dabrafenib have shown objective response rates in up to half of metastatic melanomas harboring these BRAF V600 mutations. Tumor mutation status is usually assessed starting from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue shavings. Typically, the test involves shipment of the paraffin block from the local pathology lab to a specialized molecular lab, where several steps need to be performed.MethodsThe Biocartis molecular diagnostics (MDx) prototype platform is a novel, random access, sample-in result-out automated qPCR system. It uses a disposable cartridge which can simultaneously detect and quantify up to 30 molecular markers from a wide range of solid and liquid sample types, including blood, feces, and sputum. For FFPE-based assays, a single curl or shaving is directly placed into the cartridge. The complete process time for sample preparation, PCR and reporting is less than 90 min, with <2 minutes hands-on time. We hereby present a concordance study of the Biocartis BRAF V600 Mutation prototype assay (which detects BRAF V600E, V600K, V600R, V600E2, V600D and V600M) with the Roche cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test (Cobas). Sixty-four FFPE samples from melanoma and other tumors, with varying amounts of melanin, % tumor, and % BRAF V600 mutated tumor cells were randomly selected and tested. Both the Biocartis MDx prototype platform and the Biocartis BRAF V600 Mutation prototype assay were used for research use only purposes. Deep sequencing was performed using MiSeq (Illumina) with over 5,000-fold coverage and sensitivity of 1% of minority species for each sample.ResultsOne sample was not eligible for Cobas testing because of low tumor content. Three other samples failed on both platforms. For the remaining 60 samples, results on the Biocartis MDx platform and Cobas were concordant in 58 (96.7%) samples (44 BRAF V600 WT and 14 BRAF V600 mutant samples, of which 36 samples were randomly selected and confirmed by deep sequencing). In 2 (3.3%) samples, no BRAF V600 mutation was detected by Cobas, while a BRAF V600 mutation was detected by both the Biocartis MDx platform and by deep sequencing. Both were melanoma samples (one of which was highly pigmented), excised in 1993 and 2005, and contained 4.6% V600E and 5.6% V600K (as determined by deep sequencing), respectively.ConclusionsThe new MDx platform is a fast and reliable method for BRAF V600 mutation testing directly on FFPE tumor shavings with superior analytical sensitivity, ease of use, and turnaround time compared to existing diagnostic tests.

To study this at a genome-wide level in melanoma we analyzed the methylome of 44 cases of malignant melanoma. We saw widespread demethylation in melanoma occurring preferentially outside of CpG islands. Comparison of primary and metastatic lesions showed demethylation occurs early during carcinogenesis with few additional alterations in advanced tumors. The colony stimulating factor-1 receptor was aberrantly expressed and hypomethylated in nearly all cases. The expression of CSF1R was validated by IHC on primary tumors and by qPCR and Western blotting in BRAF mutant and WT cell lines. CSF1R can be aberrantly expressed via an upstream LTR element in Hodgkin’s lymphoma. After analyzing our patient samples and the cell lines, we have found this aberrant transcript may be the dominant form in melanoma as well. Expression of one of its ligands IL34 was also shown in the cell lines by both ELISA and qPCR pointing to a potential autocrine regulatory loop. The effects of a small molecule inhibitor, PLX3397 as well as shRNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor were investigated in 2D and 3D cell culture. We saw inhibition of cell growth, smaller colony size, increased apoptosis and decreased invasiveness - suggesting a functional role for CSF1R in melanoma. Treatment of melanoma with small molecule inhibitors of BRAF V600E is effective for a time, but resistance invariably develops. The feedback activation of EGFR, BRAF amplification, BRAF splice variants and others are known to aid in the acquisition of resistance and the rebound activation of the MAPK-pathway. We are suggesting a role for CSF1R in this process. In Western experiments, the rebound of phospho-ERK after BRAF inhibitor treatment was accelerated with the addition of CSF1R ligands, or delayed with PLX3397, also attenuating AKT phosphorylation. Melanoma cells stably expressing shRNA against CSF1R recapitulated the effects of the inhibitor. Assaying the cells at different time points during a long-term V600E inhibitory experiment, we saw increasing levels of the transcription factor RUNX1, followed by increasing levels of IL34 and of the receptor, as well as its maturation, evidenced by the appearance of the high MW form. Utilizing shRNA-mediated knockdown of RUNX1 resulted in lower levels of the CSF1R and IL34 transcripts and delayed the rebound. Analysis of primary RNA-Seq data showed an increase in RUNX1, CSF1R and IL34 expression in resistant tumors. Co-inhibition of CSF1R and BRAF was also tested and resulted in synergistic blockade of cell growth in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo. The CSF1R inhibitor, PLX3397 is currently in clinical trials for glioblastoma, prostate, breast cancers and other cancers.

In this study, we evaluated the anti-proliferative effect of BGB-283 and compared it to BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in CRC patient tumor derived organoids models. BGB-283 exhibited therapeutic potentials in tumors with mutations in the MAPK pathway. Herein, we reported the establishment of tumor organoid models from 19 CRC patients tumor tissues with a success rate of 83%. Organoids maintained many characteristics of their original tumors based on their histology. Our studies using primary CRC tumor organoids showed that in contrast to vemurafenib, which only inhibited B-RAF V600E CRC tumors, BGB-283 had inhibition effect on both B-RAF V600E and KRAS mutated tumors. These findings support BGB-283 as a promising clinical stage antitumor agent in treating CRC harboring B-RAF V600E and KRAS mutations. In addition, we showed that patient-derived organoids can be a valuable tool to test drug sensitivity in a personalized treatment and help to fill the gap between tumor genetics and patient trials.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Almost 50% of melanomas harbor mutations in BRAF, mainly V600E. The mutations are usually identified in the primary tumor. However, the primary tumor is often no longer available and metastases not always reflect the characteristics of the primary tumor. In melanoma it is not clear at what stage epithelial antigen is expressed. CETCs are present in peripheral blood in a significant proportion of patients with malignant melanoma. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether these cells belong to melanoma clone due to the presence of the BRAF gene mutation in these cells. For this reason, the analysis of multiple isolated CETCs from individual patients for BRAF gene mutations was performed.  Methods', ' Blood from patients with malignant melanoma was analyzed for cells positive for the EpCAM and Melan-A using the maintrac approach, avoiding cell selection and using an image analysis system for detection. Subsequently, between 8-20 EpCAM and Melan-A positive cells from each patient were isolated individually using a semi-automated capillary approach and deposited one by one into micro cups. The DNA of individual cells was amplified by whole genome amplification and assayed using the cobas BRAF V600 mutation test. Furthermore, we performed mutation analysis of cells after magnetic bead enrichment which is known to contain a mixture of CETCs and leukocytes.  Results', ' DNA could be amplified from all individually isolated cells. In addition, we analyzed the presence of V600 mutation after magnetic bead enrichment. A BRAF mutation was detected in 20 - 75 % of evaluable cells in patients with BRAF mutation in primary tumor. In advanced stage or metastatic patients under Vemurafenib therapy, we were not able to find mutated CETCs.  Conclusions', ' Individually isolated CETCs from the peripheral blood from patients with melanoma allow not only to detect mutations but also to determine the frequency of mutated cells. This proves that at least part of the CETCs is originated from the primary tumor. Furthermore, detection of BRAF mutation in CETCs may be crucial for a successful molecular-targeted therapy.']",

Therapeutic targeting of BRAF V600E mutation in NSCLC with Dabrafenib have shown encouraging response rate. The majority of patients, however, will eventually develop resistance.Methods', ' To identify acquired resistance mechanism to Dabrafenib, resistant cells were established by exposure of MV522 NSCLC cells harboring BRAF V600E mutations to stepwise increasing Dabrafenib concentrations. To understand the biological relevance of these clones, we performed Western blot analysis, receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) array, cell viability assays, Real time-PCR, sanger-sequencing, siRNA transfection and immunoprecipitation in vitro. MV 522 cells and resistant cells were inoculated to nude mouse to assess the combination effect of BRAF and EGFR inhibitor and evaluate the expression of biomarker from in vitro assay using immunohistochemistry in vivo.Results', 'The resistant clones displayed activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-RAS-CRAF signaling and achieved sustained activation of ERK1/2, but not MEK1/2, despite high concentration of Dabrafenib. Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) selectively enhanced cell viability in the presence of Dabrafenib in MV 522 cells, even though EGFR ligands (TGF-alpha, Epiregulin, and Amphiregulin, and HB-EGF) increased in GSR clones. Combination of Dabrafenib with EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib or cetuximab) effectively blocked transactivation of CRAF from BRAF via inhibition of EGFR-RAS signaling in resistant cells, but knockdown of CRAF by short interfering RNA (siRNA) did not affect ERK activation. Interestingly, inhibition of receptor interaction protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) by siRNA in combination with Dabrafenib abrogated tumor cell survival via inhibition of ERK1/2 in the resistant clones. Furthermore, combination of Dabrafenib with gefitinib or cetuximab effectively inhibited activation of RIPK2 and ERK1/2 in resistant clones. The enhancement of Dabrafenib sensitivity by combination of gefitinib was confirmed in vivo.Discussion', ' Taken together, these findings suggest that the acquired resistance to Dabrafenib in BRAF V600E mutant NSCLC is uniquely mediated by EGFR-RAS-RIPK2-ERK signaling, bypassing MEK1/2, which may necessitate therapeutic strategies different from those of melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['V600 mutations of BRAF are present in 40% of cutaneous melanoma and are currently targeted for therapy by specific inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib). While BRAFV600 mutations are mostly heterozygous, the impact of BRAF mutated allelic specific imbalance (MASI) on the sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors and on clinical outcome has not been evaluated so far. Here we compared cell proliferation, tumor growth and vemurafenib sensitivity of heterozygous versus homozygous BRAF V600E mutated melanoma cell lines. We also performed a retrospective study evaluating the impact on overall survival and drug response of BRAF V600E mutated melanoma patients with or without MASI.Methods', 'We conducted proliferation and cytotoxity assays to compare cell growth and sensitivity to vemurafenib and trametinib in heterozygous, versus homozygous BRAF V600 mutated human melanoma cell lines. Their in vivo tumorigenesis and sensitivity to vemurafenib was also evaluated upon engraftment in SCID mice. A retrospective series of 179 patients with metastatic melanoma harboring a BRAF V600 mutations were analyzed and early first line treatment response was compared between patients with or without MASI.Results', 'Our results showed that heterozygous BRAF V600 mutated melanoma cell lines proliferate less rapidly than homozygous cell lines in vitro (cell proliferation counts after 7 days range from 3.6 x106 to 7.7x106 cells for homozygote cells, and from 4.8x104 to 5.5x105 for heterozygous cell lines) and in vivo (palpable tumors appeared on average 7 days after inoculation for homozygous cells but after 39 days for heterozygous cells). Heterozygous cell lines are more resistant to BRAF inhibitors either in vitro or in vivo (IC50 of vemurafenib ranged from 0,1 to 0,198 M for homozygous cells and from 8,62 to 22,65 M for heterozygous cell lines). We have also shown that patients with BRAF V600 mutated tumors with MASI may have initially a poorer prognosis (median overall survival 733 days IC95% [381; 1762] versus 1011 days IC95%[879;2969] p=0.236) but tend to have better responses to systemic drugs than patients without MASI (percentage of primary resistance 23% versus 34%; p=0.56).In conclusion', 'This translational study shows that a MASI of BRAF in melanoma is associated with a higher cell proliferation and tumorigenic potential in vitro and in vivo. This mutational status is also associated with a better response to BRAF inhibitor in vitro and in mice xenografts. Clinical relevance of these data should be more thoroughly evaluated on larger and more homogeneous series of patients however our preliminary data show a trend toward a clinical-experimental correlation with similar yet still statistically insignificant results. If confirmed, our data suggest that study of the MASI of BRAF mutation could serve as a predictive marker of patient response to vemurafenib. The role of paradoxical activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in cells without MASI of BRAF needs to be further explored.']",

        "Background":"['Low grade gliomas (LGG) are the most common tumors of the central nervous system in children, accounting for about 50% of all brain tumors. They represent a heterogeneous group of grade I and II tumors according to the WHO classification. Pediatric LGG, is associated with activation of BRAF through a tandem duplication that results in the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion or through an activating point mutation of BRAF (predominantly V600E). More recent findings suggest that the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion is restricted to Grade 1 tumors (70-90%) whereas BRAF(V600E) occurs more frequently in Grade 2-4 tumors (~23%). Findings for BRAF mutation, similar to other tumors with activated BRAF (e.g. melanoma), and the phase I activity of MEK inhibitor in the PBTC-029 protocol, suggest that activated BRAF may provide a validated drug target. Previous studies from our lab indicate that, in the context of mutant BRAF, inhibition of MEK inhibits TORC1 signaling and may induce a ‘BRCA-like’ phenotype, through depletion of FANCD2. Potentially suppression of TORC1 could have effects on other DNA damage response pathways that could compensate for loss of FANCD2. To understand the consequences of MEK inhibition in the context of BRAF abreation in LGG we surveyed DNA repair genes that may be regulated via the MEK/TORC1 pathway in BRAF mutant cells. The objective of this particular study was to examine the mechanism and significance of MEK inhibition to the repair of DNA damage by the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. For this study, we have used glioma cell lines having BRAF(V600E) mutation; the BT40 cell line was developed from patient-derived astrocytoma xenograft (PDX) model in mice in our lab and AM38c1 and DBTRG-05MG cells were generously provided by T. Nicolades. Annexin binding assay demonstrated that MEKi treatment significantly increased the percentage of apoptosis and necrosis of glioma cells. Human DNA repair PCR Array analysis identified MEKi induced down regulation of genes involved in Base Excision Repair (BER), Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), Mismatch Repair (MMR) and Double-Strand Break (DSB) repair pathways. DSB repair genes were further validated by real time qPCR analysis. Immunoblot analysis of glioma cell lines indicate that MEKi treatment enhanced the gamma-H2AX levels. To elucidate the mechanism of DSB repair pathway in presence of MEKi, clonogenic assay, nuclear foci formation assay, and GFP reporter assay for homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) are ongoing. Collectively, these findings demonstrate for the first time a previously unknown role for MEKi in treatment of glioma cells that involves inhibition of DNA double-strand break repair pathways. Further, we will examine the mechanism and significance of MEK/ERK and TORC1 signaling axis in regulation of DNA repair genes and its effect on LGG. Understanding how MEK plays a role in DNA repair pathways will be useful in maximizing treatment opportunities for childhood glioma.']",

Selective BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib have been observed to neutralize oncogenic the signaling, inhibit cellular growth, and improve patient outcome. Although these mechanisms of vemurafenib resistance have been reported, few studies focused on how to overcome the resistance. Propranolol, a non-selective β-blocker, was confirmed to involve in multiple anticancer effects. Our previous study also showed propranolol inhibited melanoma by suppressing MAPK and AKT pathways in vitro an in vivo. But its efficacy and mechanism of overcoming vemurafenib still remain unknown in melanoma. Here, we explored the effect of propranolol on the A375, P-8 (patient-derived melanoma cell line) vemurafenib resistance cell line and resistance mice xenografts. Cell viability assay demonstrated that 2μM -20μM vemurafenib couldn’t decrease the proliferation but 24h-120h of incubation of 2μM-200μM propranolol inhibited viability with a concentration and time dependent manner in the two resistance cell line. TUNEL staining showed 24h incubation of 20μM propranolol alone or plus 4μM vemurafeinb obviously increased cell apoptosis. Mice received daily ig. administration of propranolol at the dose of 2 mg/kg alone or plus 10 mg/kg for 21days.

IHC showed propranolol also reduced Ki67 index both in propranolol and plus group when compared with vemurafenib treated mice. Furthermore, RNA sequencing was performed to explore the mechanism of propranolol overcoming the resistance, the data showed propranolol largely reduced mRNA levels of IGF family (IGFBP3, IGFLR1, IGFBP6, IGF2, IGF1R.etc.) but elevated the expressions of innate immune related genes (NKG7, TLR9, NCR3.etc.) in A375-vemr cell line.

We evaluated copy number variants (CNVs) using array Comparative Genomic Hybridization in melanoma tumor samples from patients treated on this trial. Genomic DNA was hybridized on SurePrint G4 human CGH microarrays 2 x 440 K (Agilent). Copy number gains and losses were  0.3 or  -0.3 on a log2 scale, respectively (Nexus BioDiscovery, Inc). In 119 melanoma tumor samples, 45% had BRAF mutations, 24% NRAS mutations, and 24% without either (designated WT), CNVs were evaluated in an initial set of 26 genes known to be involved in melanoma pathogenesis. Overall genomic instability, as measured by number of genes with CNVs, was associated with poor ECOG performance status (P=0.007) and marginally significant for more organs with metastatic involvement (P=0.06), and is consistent with other studies suggesting that genomic instability is a predictor of worsened outcome. We further explored the association between copy number and somatic mutation status. Not surprisingly, BRAF gene amplification was observed in 91% of BRAF mutant melanoma tumor samples (P<0.001, as compared to 66% of NRAS/WT samples). The average value of BRAF copy number was higher in tumor samples with BRAF V600K mutations compared to samples with BRAF V600E mutations (1.11 v 0.55, P<0.001).

The average value of MET copy number was also higher in BRAF V600K mutant compared to BRAF V600E mutant melanoma (0.53 v 0.27, P=0.04), which may contribute to the differing clinical behaviors of melanomas with the two mutations. Patients with BRAF copy number gain had a trend towards lower overall response rate to either treatment compared to diploid (15.2% v 29.6%, OR=0.37, P=0.08).

Chi-square and Mann Whitney U tests were used to assess the association of clinico-pathologic features with BRAF status. Multivariate analysis was performed using a logistic regression model. Results', ' 97/207 pts (47%) had a mutation in exon 15 of the BRAF gene. Of these 72 (74%) were V600E, 19 (20%) V600K, and 6(6%) another mutation or combination. Pt age at diagnosis of DM was significantly different for mut (median age 56, n = 73) and wt (median age 62, n = 81', ' p < 0.005) tumours. There was no difference between mut/wt in disease free interval from diagnosis of PM to date of DM, sex, site of metastases at diagnosis of DM, regional lymph node involvement ever, resection of DM with intent to cure, response to chemotherapy (CT) or length of response to CT. ECOG status was not significantly different between mut/wt when adjusted for age. Features of the PM significantly associated (p < 0.05) with BRAF mut were', ' age at PM  50 yrs (OR = 3.16, 95%CI', ' 1.28-7.80); superficial spreading or nodular histopathologic subtype (OR = 3.96, 95%CI', ' 1.32-11.86); and truncal location (OR = 2.66, 95%CI', ' 1.09-6.47). Conclusions', ' The BRAF mutation rate in an Australian MM cohort was 47% and non-V600E activating mutations were more common than previously reported.

        "Background":"['Once melanoma has metastasized to distant sites it has proved difficult to treat by a variety of chemotherapeutic and biological agents. Significant advances have been made in identifying subgroups of patients with activating mutations in signalling pathway proteins. In particular, the finding that approximately 50% of melanoma have V600E mutations in the BRAF serine/threonine kinase has resulted in the generation of a number of new drugs which target the mutated active form of BRAF. One of these drugs, Vemurafenib (PLX4032/RG704) has shown significant promise in prolonging survival compared to standard chemotherapy, however reports of patient relapse has prompted investigation into means of overcoming acquired resistance to the agent. We report here that efficacy of the PLX4032 analogue, PLX4720, is greatly enhanced by co-treatment with the BH3 mimetic, ABT-737. Treatment with either agent is able to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells, however the kinetics are typically slow, with cell death occurring 48 or 72 hours post treatment. In this study, while either agent was largely ineffective as a single treatment 24 hours following treatment, addition of the combination of drugs rapidly induced significant killing. We show that apoptosis was caspase-dependent, in that inhibition of caspase activation almost totally blocked induction of cell death by the combination of agents. Apoptosis was also associated with activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, with reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-9. Exposure of melanoma cells to PLX4720 rapidly decreased phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bim, resulting in strong upregulation as early as 6 hours after addition of the compound. Strong upregulation of Bim was shown by RNAi knockdown to play an important role in sensitizing cells to co-treatment with ABT-737, by assisting in the inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Further, the combination of agents induced significant levels of apoptosis in melanoma cells derived from patients harbouring the BRAFV600E mutation. Collectively, these results show that the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 sensitizes melanoma cells to apoptosis by the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 in a Bim- and caspase-dependent manner. Additionally, these studies identify a potential clinical application for BH3 mimetics in overcoming resistance of melanoma to treatment with BRAF inhibitors, increasing efficacy of this class of agent and improving patient outcomes.']",

        "Background":"['Despite recent success of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib in the clinic, nearly all of those treated follow a course in which initial tumor regression was followed by eventual relapse, which constitutes a major barrier to long-term therapeutic management of melanoma. We have identified a novel mechanism of microenvironment-mediated drug resistance that arises from the release of TGF from melanomas that lack PTEN expression leading to the recruitment of host fibroblasts and the generation of a protective microenvironment through autocrine and paracrine fibronectin secretion facilitating therapeutic escape. Preliminary studies show that BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cell lines that lacked PTEN expression dramatically increased their secretion of TGF- following vemurafenib treatment, as detected by western blot, immunofluorescence and ELISA assays. Furthermore, autocrine TGF secretion initiated with vemurafinib treatment stimulated the upregulation and secretion of fibronectin in PTEN- cells. The vemurafenib-mediated ECM remodeling in this case was dependent upon autocrine TGF signaling and could be attenuated following pre-treatment with the TGF receptor kinase inhibitor SB505124 or by siRNA knockdown of TGF receptor I. A mass spectrometry based phospho-proteomic screen in conjunction with innovative network modeling approaches suggested that increased integrin 51 signaling was a key adaptive response of PTEN- melanoma cells to BRAF inhibitor therapy. The importance of increased fibronectin expression and integrin 51 signaling in the therapeutic escape of PTEN- melanoma cells was confirmed by the significant increases in vemurafenib-induced apoptosis observed following siRNA knockdown of either integrin 5, 1, or fibronectin expression. A mass spectrometry screen (LC-MRM) of 18 BH3 proteins demonstrated Mcl-1 and Bak to be critical apoptosis regulators in the microenvironment-mediated drug resistance response. The importance of PTEN loss and Mcl-1 downregulation in therapeutic escape was validated in PTEN- melanoma cell lines expressing doxycycline inducible forms of PTEN, lipid phosphatase mutant PTEN and Mcl-1. Novel organotypic co-culture models were developed to demonstrate that TGF- released from PTEN- melanoma cell lines activated host fibroblasts leading to the attenuation of drug response in the tumor cells. Our overall hypothesis is that BRAF inhibition remodels both the melanoma and host microenvironments to provide a protective sanctuary for the minor populations of melanoma cells that escape therapy. We postulate that tumor eradication can only be achieved by a dual therapeutic strategy that targets both the bulk tumor and the microenvironment.']",

        "Background":"['The BRAFi, has been applied to treat melanomas harboring (V600E) mutation. While the response rate is high, resistance is inevitable. Despite combination with MEK inhibitor which enhances the antitumor efficacy as well as increases duration of response, patients ultimately relapse. Therefore, there is an urgent need for second line treatment for melanoma patients who are resistant to BRAFi treatment.In this study, we found that BRAFi-resistant (BR) melanoma cells are susceptible to arginine deprivation due to their inability to turn on argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), a key enzyme for arginine synthesis as well as their inability to undergo autophagy. Thus, arginine deprivation using pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20, supplied by Polaris Inc.) which degrades arginine to citrulline results in cell death. We established 6 BR cell lines from BRAF mutant (V600E) cell lines including ASS-negative cell lines such as A375 and MEL-1220 (derived from a patient) and ASS-positive and/or inducible cell lines include UACC-62, SK-MEL28, A2058, and MEL-GP (derived from a patient) by continuous exposure to vemurafenib at IC50 over 30 weeks. MTT, caspase activity, and Annexin V/PI analyses showed that treatment with ADI-PEG20 (100ng/ml) for 72 hr induced 2-3 fold increase in growth inhibition and 10-30% increase in apoptosis in BR cells compared to their parental cells counterpart. The xenograft mouse model also confirmed that ADI-PEG20 abrogated tumor growth of A2058BR cells but only retarded growth seen in A2058 cells (tumor growth inhibition (T/C ratio) in A2058 and A2058BR is 38.7% vs. 8.3%; T/C<42% indicates significant inhibition). The results observed by cyto-ID staining combined with fluorescent microscope and electron microscope also exhibited 40-80% decrease in autophagosome formation in BR cells compared to parental cells after treatment with ADI-PEG20.We further found that BRAFi-resistance attenuated autophagy and ASS re-expression due to loss of Atg5 and c-Myc. Atg5-overexpressed plasmid rescued 12-35% apoptosis in MEL-1220BR and A2058BR cells through autophagic process as evidenced by more autophagosome formation following treatment with ADI-PEG20. The other mechanism leading to attenuated ASS re-expression is decreased c-Myc (positive regulator of ASS transcription). It is known that c-Myc stability is governed by ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation. Using immunoprecipitation assay, our results showed that the levels of deubiquitinating enzyme, USP28, were too low to prevent c-Myc from ubiquitination. Overall, our data suggest that attenuated Atg5 which halted autophagy and decreased c-Myc which prevented re-expression of ASS made the BR cells vulnerable to cell death upon arginine deprivation. Thus, ADI-PEG20 is a potential candidate for salvage therapy in BR patients (Supported by R01CA152197).']",

At the time of reporting, 11 pts remain on therapy, and 6 have stopped therapy (5 with PD and 1 due to an AE). Thirteen pts were evaluable for efficacy. The best response for these pts included 7 PRs (5 confirmed PRs), 1 SD, and 4 PD; 1 pt discontinued due to an SAE (hypersensitivity reaction) prior to response assessment (ORR, 54%). The median duration of treatment for all 17 pts is approximately 9 weeks (range, 1-69 weeks).

Targeting these signaling molecules in the pathway represents a promising strategy to target dysregulated MAPK signaling. BGB-283 is a novel pan-RAF inhibitor and currently under clinical development to treat BRAF and KRAS/NRAS mutated tumors. In this study, we show that BGB-283 inhibits WT B-RAF dimer much more potently than vemurafenib at millimolar ATP concentration that is representative of the cellular ATP level, although BGB-283 and vemurafenib display similar inhibitory activity at the Km ATP concentration. BGB-283 has very slow off-rate and the dissociation half-life (t1/2) on WT B-RAF enzyme is well above 24 hrs. In comparison, vemurafenib has much faster off rates with t1/2 in the range of minutes. The crystal structure of BGB-283/B-RAF protein complex shows the benzimidazole and trifluoro group of BGB-283 binds significantly deeper into pocket formed by -C helix and activation loop than vemurafenib. BGB-283 exhibits time-dependent inhibition both in biochemical assay and in B-RAF or K-RAS mutated cells. BGB-283 potently inhibits the p-ERK signaling in splicing isoform p61B-RAF(V600E) cells which were reported to be resistant to vemurafenib through a dimer mechanism. In vivo, BGB-283 significantly suppressed the tumor growth in A375-p61B-RAF(V600E) melanoma xenograft model. In addition, BGB-283 inhibits vemurafenib induced p-ERK activation and selumetinib induced p-MEK feedback activation in K-RAS mutated cancer cells. In both cases, activation is reported to be mediated by RAF dimers. Taken together, we propose that BGB-283 is a novel, slow-off RAF dimer inhibitor that targets the MAPK signaling differently from the first generation BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. This feature of BGB-283 may help to address the drug resistance issues in BRAF mutated tumors and further expand its utility as mono- or combination therapy into RAS mutated patient populations.']",

Other targetable genes enriched in mBC with BRAF GA included CDK6 (p = 0.001), HGF (p < 0.001) and MET(p < 0.001). The median TMB was 4.5 with 17 (13%) of cases with TMB > 10 mut/Mb and 7 (5%) of cases with > 20 mut/Mb. Conclusions', 'BRAF alterations, although uncommon in mBC representing only 1.2% of cases, are enriched in TNBC and feature both targetable base substitutions and rare fusions. BRAF GA may be a rare cause of anti-HER2 therapy resistance in a subset of ERBB2 driven mBC. Targetable genes co-altered with BRAF in mBC include CDK6, HGF and MET. The TMB in BRAF altered mBC is significantly higher than that for mBC in general and indicates potential role for immunotherapy for these patients.']",

        "Background":"['Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) accounts for approximately 2% of diagnosed malignancies in canines. The majority of canine TCCs are invasive, intermediate to high grade tumors sharing similarities with human muscle invasive TCCs in risk factors, histology, sites of metastasis, and therapeutic response to single agents. Whole exome sequencing of canine TCC tumors was performed to identify somatic mutations in known cancer driver and repressor genes that could potentially contribute to canine TCC pathogenesis. A valine to glutamic acid mutation in BRAF homologous to the activating V600E mutation identified in human melanoma, colorectal and thyroid cancers was identified in 70% of sequenced tumors. Sensitivity to the BRAFV600E inhibitor Vemurafenib was tested in three BRAF mutant canine TCC cell lines (Bliley, Tyler1 and Tyler2) and two BRAF wild type canine TCC cell lines (Angus1 and Kinsey). All five canine TCC cell lines exhibited IC50s greater than 10μM, with BRAF mutant cell lines being slightly more sensitive. These sensitivity ranges are similar to those of some mutant human colorectal cancer cell lines, indicating that additional mechanisms may contribute to Vemurafenib resistance. Western blot analysis was performed to measure relative abundance of pERK, a downstream target of BRAF, in canine TCCs in response to serum starvation. All TCC cell lines showed sustained pERK expression in the absence of serum, indicating constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. The five canine TCC lines were treated with 15μM Vemurafenib for 6 and 24 hours and their lysates were analyzed for pERK protein expression. pERK abundance was decreased in only the BRAF mutant cell lines after 6 hours of treatment. However, this decrease was less pronounced after 24 hours, suggesting that resistance mechanisms are bypassing BRAF to activate ERK. Sequence analysis of an additional panel of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded canine TCCs also revealed a mutation in RanBP2 in 31% of samples. Strikingly, the RanBP2 mutation appeared to be mutually exclusive to BRAF V to E mutant tumors with only two of the analyzed samples carrying both mutations. Significant tumor heterogeneity was implicated due to low level mutant amplification in these samples. It has been reported that loss of RanBP2 is synthetic lethal in BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer. Since RanBP2 forms complexes with CRM1 at the nuclear pore complex for nuclear export and at the kinetochore during mitosis, canine TCC cell lines were treated with KPT-185, a CRM1 inhibitor. BRAF mutant TCC cell lines had IC50 values ranging from 45nM to 65nM and were approximately ten-fold more sensitive than wild type cell lines. Overall, this data indicates that the pathogenesis of canine TCC likely depends on driving factors in addition to constitutive BRAF signaling, but Vemurafenib resistant BRAF mutant tumors can be targeted through inhibition of the nucleopore complex.']",

This led us to examine the combination of romidepsin with MAPK pathway inhibitors in cell lines harboring the V600E BRAF mutation that leads to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. To more closely simulate clinical administration of romidepsin, 11 V600E BRAF positive cell lines (8 melanomas and 3 colorectal cancers) were exposed to 25 ng/ml romidepsin in the presence or absence of the MAPK pathway inhibitors AZD6244 (selumetinib, 250 nM), PD0325901 (250 nM) or PLX4032 (vemurafenib, 1 M) for 6 h, after which the cells were placed in romidepsin-free medium containing the inhibitors and incubated for an additional 42 h. Apoptosis was subsequently measured by Annexin V and propidium iodide staining. Of the 11 cell lines, 10 exhibited significantly higher annexin staining after short-term romidepsin treatment alone (control, median annexin value 7.1%3.8% vs. treated, median annexin value 34.7%17.8%, p<0.001). Combined treatment with romidepsin and selumetinib, PD0325901 or vemurafenib resulted in a significantly higher percent of annexin positive cells (p<0.05) in 9 to 11 of the 11 BRAF mutant cell lines examined compared to treatment with romidepsin alone; expression of dephosphorylated Bim was observed. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated inhibition of the MAPK pathway at the concentrations used; apoptosis was associated with increased PARP cleavage. Using mitochondrial separation techniques, we also observed increased levels of Bim in the mitochondrial membrane fraction and reduced expression of mitochondrial hexokinase 2 in cells treated with combined romidepsin/MEK inhibitor compared to either compound alone. Our results suggest a critical role for apoptotic pathways in cell death due to romidepsin, that MAPK signaling promotes resistance via Bim degradation, and that combined treatment with romidpesin and BRAF or MEK inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of cancers harboring BRAF mutations.']",

PLX4032 (RG7204) is an oral inhibitor of the mutant BRAF kinase, with pronounced activity in BRAF-mutant melanoma patients (pts). Methods', ' In this phase I study, we treated an extension cohort of mCRC pts whose tumors were positive for mutant BRAF with PLX4032 at the previously determined maximum tolerated dose of 960 mg BID. The BRAF mutation was centrally confirmed by Taqman PCR. Efficacy was evaluated by RECIST every 8 weeks. Results', ' 21 mCRC pts were enrolled, with a median age of 65 and ECOG performance status of 0 (35%) or 1 (65%). All but one had received prior therapy for metastatic disease. PLX4032 PK values were ~20% lower than than those previously observed for melanoma. 19 pts were evaluable for response, with 1 confirmed partial response and 4 minor responses ( 10% shrinkage). 5 pts showed a mixed response pattern (i.e., with both regressing and progressing lesions). 2 of the 3 pts who underwent repeat FDG-PET imaging achieved a metabolic response, which was concordant with RECIST changes. Median progression-free survival was 3.7 months, with 2 pts still on study. PLX4032 was generally well tolerated. Three pts had dose limiting toxicities of G3 rash and G3 nausea. Other G3 or G4 drug-attributable adverse events in all cycles were seen in 6 pts, and included fatigue, diarrhea, neutropenia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. Five pts developed cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas consistent with keratoacanthomas, which were managed by local excision. Conclusions', ' The clinical activity seen with PLX4032 in previously treated mCRC pts with V600E BRAF mutations is more modest than had been seen in melanoma, but this activity does confirm mutant BRAF as a therapeutic target in this disease. The biology of BRAF activation in pts with CRC is clearly more heterogenous than in melanoma, especially as evidenced in those pts with a mixed response.

        "Background":"['The combination of BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) and MEK inhibitor (MEKi) has been FDA approved to treat melanomas harboring (V600E) mutation. Although most BRAF mutant melanomas are highly responsive to these treatments, they all relapse ultimately. In this study, we found a unique mechanism which can be used to treat BRAFi resistant patients. Five BRAFi resistant (BR) cells were established from known BRAF mutant cell lines A375, MEL-1220, A2058, UACC-62, and SK-MEL28 by long-term exposure to BRAFi. These BR cells are hypersensitive to ADI-PEG20, an enzyme which degrades arginine to citrulline. ADI-PEG20 treatment resulted in a 2-3-fold decrease in BR cell viability (MTT assay) and 10-30% increase in apoptosis (Annexin V/PI) in BR cells compared to their paternal cells. The mechanisms involved are as follows', ' All BR cells express very low levels or do not express argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS, a key enzyme to generate arginine from citrulline). Thus, these BR cells rely primarily on exogenous arginine. Furthermore, these BR cells also have attenuation of glucose uptake which makes them rely mainly on amino acids. Importantly, their ability to undergo autophagy upon nutritional stress is also impaired. The underlying mechanism for low levels of ASS is due to diminished c-Myc expression which is a positive regulator for ASS. Additionally, AMPK-1, which possesses phosphorylation site at Thr172 governing autophagy and glucose uptake, was attenuated in BR cells. Overexpression of AMPK-1 using plasmid transfection in A2058BR and MEL-1220BR cells rescued 8-28% ADI-PEG20-induced apoptosis and enhanced autophagosome formation (detected by LysoTacker). Conversely, knockdown of AMPK-1 using siRNA significantly enhanced ADI-PEG20-reduced cell viability (compared to non-targeting siRNA) in A2058 and MEL-1220 cells through attenuation of autophagy and glucose uptake. This is evidenced by decreased GLUT1 and LC3-II expression, and low activity of 2-NBDG uptake, which also can be seen in most BR cells. The xenograft model also showed that ADI-PEG20 aborted tumor growth of A2058BR and A375BR cells but retarded growth of A2058 and A375 cells. Immunohistochemical staining further confirmed lower levels of ASS and AMPK-1 in A2058BR xenograft and in tumor tissues from 10 BR patients relative to their parental counterparts (average H-scores of ASS and AMPK in parental tissues vs. BR tissues are 58.2 vs. 7.8, and 146 vs. 78.3, respectively, p <0.03). Importantly, these findings also apply to cell lines and tumor samples from patients who failed both BRAF and MEK inhibitor. In summary, our data suggest that attenuated AMPK-1 mediated autophagy and glucose uptake and decreased c-Myc mediated ASS re-expression sensitize BR cells to arginine deprivation. Thus, ADI-PEG20 is a potential salvage therapy for BR patients (Supported by R01CA152197).']",

However, resistance to therapy with BRAF kinase inhibitors is associated with reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and combinations of BRAF and MEK inhibitors are now considered to be the standard of care of targeted therapy in BRAF mutated MMP. As higher exposure of DAB has been associated to higher probability of response, and considering the wide inter-individual variability in DAB pharmacokinetics, a method for estimating the area under the curve (AUC) of DAB was necessary to perform therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). The objective of this study was to implement a Bayesian estimation of DAB AUC0-12h in mutated-BRAFV600E MMP treated with DAB alone, and to assess the robustness of this model in MMP treated with DAB in combination with trametinib, as trametinib may have a slight inhibitory effect on DAB elimination clearance (+23% AUC) . Methods', ' This monocentric study was conducted in onco-dermatology department of Saint-Louis Hospital and included patients from April 2014 to November 2015.

To study the efficacy of a c-Met and BRAF inhibitor combination, two cell lines were selected', ' MU, which is positive for the BRAF activating V600E mutation, and MM-RU, which is negative for this mutation. c-Met inhibitor SU11274 resistant cell lines were generated by exposing these parental lines to increasing concentrations of SU11274, until the final IC50 concentrations of resistant cells were 6-8 fold higher than those of parental lines. When c-Met and BRAF kinase inhibitors SU11274 (0.075M) and vemurafenib (0.15M) were administered individually and in combination, both drugs were able to significantly (p<0.01) synergize their inhibitory effects in MU parental and SU11274 resistant cells (60% and 58%, respectively) compared to their individual treatments (MUP 41%/5% and MUR 46%/0% vemurafenib/SU11274, respectively). When cells from the RU line were treated with varying concentrations of tivantinib, a c-Met inhibitor currently in clinical trials (0.05M - 0.3M) and Vemurafenib (0.025M - 0.15M), both parental and resistant cells did not show any synergism in combination.

Treatment with JNJ also resulted in 80% +/- 2.35% reduction in blood vessels as seen by CD31 staining and decreased VEGF expression and increased TSP1 expression as seen by immunohistochemistry in MM-RU indicating that inhibition of vessel formation may be one of the mechanisms by which JNJ inhibits tumor growth.

The signaling pathway plays a key role in cell survival, growth and proliferation. The B-Raf mutants are found in various cancer patients, such as melanoma, papillary thyroid, cisplatin-refractory testicular cancer, colorectal, ovarian, and prostate cancer. Especially, over 90% of detected mutations in B-Raf are a V600E which leads to constitutive kinase activity 500-fold greater than B-Raf wild type and correlates with increased malignancy and decreased response the chemotherapy. There are currently numerous efforts to develop therapeutic agents to target B-Raf or its downstream kinases. The first Raf inhibitor to enter clinical development was the multi-kinase inhibitor Nexavar (sorafenib tosylate), which is now approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. However, the broad selectivity profile of this inhibitor makes it unsuitable for proof of concept evaluation of Raf kinase inhibition in tumors.

        "Background":"['New therapies of metastatic melanoma, including BRAF inhibitors, check-point blockade or adoptive T-cell transfer, hold high promise. However, their efficacy remains unsatisfactory. Combination of different modalities offers an opportunity to enhance their effect. We studied mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR) previously implicated in synergistic effect of cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Approximately 50% of human melanomas bear the activating mutation V600E in BRAF that can be selectively targeted with BRAF inhibitor PLX4720. We have observed that in vitro treatment of human V600E-positive melanoma cells 451Lu and WM983B leads to a dose-dependent up-regulation of mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR) in the cell surface. An increase in cell surface MPR, enhanced recombinant Granzyme B uptake, a requirements for effective combination with immunotherapy. This effect of PLX4720 on MPR expression was reproduced in a mouse model featuring xenograft 451Lu-derived subcutaneous tumors. This effect was limited only to sensitive cell lines, disappearing completely after resistance had been induced by extended treatment with growing doses of the drug. We have previously determined that autophagy has a key role in MPR up-regulation after chemotherapy or radiation therapy. However, in the case of PLX4720, autophagy occurs 1-2 days after the start of the treatment while membrane MPR was up-regulated not early than 3-4 and 10-14 days after the start of the treatment in 451Lu and WM983B cells respectively. In addition, autophagy was present independently of whether the cells were resistant to PLX4720 or not. These data indicate that autophagy was probably not responsible in PLX4720 inducible up-regulation of MPR. We observed a parallel changes in MPR up-regulation and phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization in live melanoma cells. PS and MPR co-localized on cell surface after the treatment with PLX4720. Co-incubation of PLX4720 with PS-specific antibody resulted in an ablation of the subsequent membrane MPR up-regulation.

In the current study, we evaluated the pharmacological activity of BI847325, a dual inhibitor of MEK and Aurora kinases against multiple melanoma cell line models.METHODS', ' The cytotoxic effect of BI847325 was evaluated in vitro in a panel of selected BRAF-mutant vemurafenib resistant cell lines by Alamar blue and Annexin V binding assay. 3D spheroid model systems and colony formation assays demonstrated the long-term growth inhibitory effect of BI847325. Western blot analysis and qRT-PCR studies were carried out to evaluate the mechanism underlying BI5-mediated cytotoxicity. In vivo studies in Balb SCID mice were performed to assess the suppression of BRAF-mutant xenografts on treatment with BI847325.RESULTS', ' BI847325 potently reduced the growth and survival of BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines with acquired and intrinsic BRAF inhibitor resistance (NRAS mutations, BRAF splice forms, Cyclin D1 amplification, RTK upregulation, PTEN loss, COT amplification). We confirmed that BI847325 induced apoptosis through decrease in Mcl-1 mRNA and protein expression and increase in BIM expression. The effects of BI847325 upon BIM and Mcl-1 expression could not be mimicked by the combination of other MEK and aurora kinase inhibitors. For the first time we demonstrated that BI847325 reverses the acquired vemurafenib resistance by inhibiting MEK expression at mRNA and protein level. A strong suppression of MEK expression was observed without recovery following 72 h of washout. In vivo studies revealed complete tumor suppression with no recurrence over a period of 65 days of treatment with 70mg/kg/week dose of BI847325. In contrast, treatment with vemurafenib analog PLX4720 in the same mouse model was associated with tumor relapse after 30 days of treatment. BI847325 also successfully suppressed the long-term growth of xenografts with acquired vemurafenib resistance. Analysis of tumor samples complied with in vitro results demonstrating inhibition of phospho-ERK, phospho-Histone3, Mcl-1 and total MEK.CONCLUSION', ' In conclusion we report for the first time that BI847325, a novel ATP-competitive MEK/ Aurora kinase inhibitor effectively inhibits BRAF-mutant melanoma and overcomes vemurafenib-resistance by decreasing expression of MEK and Mcl-1; in vitro and in vivo.

In 1205Lu tumors, re-activation of the ERK1/2 pathway was evident prior to re-growth. Additionally, cell lines generated from these resistant tumors exhibited elevated levels of ERK1/2 suggesting that resistance to BRAF + MEK inhibitors involves re-activation of ERK1/2 signaling. In comparison to parental cells, resistant cells in vitro displayed reduced levels of apoptosis, increased proliferation, and increased viability in the presence of BRAF plus MEK inhibitor.

However, the toxicities of these inhibitors are uniquely highlighted in an indolent disease like PTC, which would require patients to endure toxicities long-term. Our goal was to determine if tetrathimoybdate (TM), a well-tolerated copper chelator we have previously shown to inhibit BRAF-mutated melanoma via MEK inhibition, can inhibit BRAF-driven PTC growth. Methods', ' We assessed TM in comparison to current standard of care (SOC), Lenvatinib and Sorafenib, and mutant BRAF inhibitor, Vemurafenib. Anchorage independent growth assays were used to test the inhibitory effect of these drugs on human BRAF-mutated PTC cell lines. We then confirmed these findings by treating a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of aggressive BRAF-driven PTC. Results', ' TM inhibited 57.5% of colony growth in vitro, which was not significantly different from the 42.4% and 32.2% inhibition by Sorafenib and Lenvatinib, respectively. TM inhibition was less effective than the 70.3% inhibition by Vemurafenib (p =0.04). We confirmed these results in vivo, where mice on the TM arm, on average, were observed to have 14.8% of their thyroid glands occupied by tumor, a statistically significant reduction from the mice in the control arm, whose tumor load averaged 23.6% (p= 0.008).

        "Background":"['The RAS-RAF-MEK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways are two major signaling pathways involved in human cancer. Components of these two pathways are frequently mutated in a wide variety of solid tumors. Concurrent double mutations in the two pathways are also observed quite often in a broad range of tumor types. Additionally, inhibition of one of these pathways often leads to the upregulation of the other pathway and development of resistance. In preclinical models, combined inhibition of both pathways has been shown to impart greater efficacy as compared to inhibition of either pathway alone. ASN003 is a novel, highly selective, small-molecule inhibitor of both RAS-RAF and PI3K pathways, discovered using a rational design approach. ASN003 shows potent inhibitory activity against B-RAF and PI3K kinases (low nM IC50). Within the PI3K family, ASN003 has high selectivity for inhibition of PI3Kα and PI3Kδ over PI3Kβ. In a panel of 292 kinases, ASN003 showed high selectivity for inhibiting B-RAF and PI3 kinases, and associated mutant kinases. In cell-based mechanistic studies, ASN003 inhibited phosphorylation of ERK, AKT and S6, and showed strong antiproliferative activity (IC50 = 60-300 nM) in cell lines with B-RAF and PI3K pathway mutations as well as in vemurafenib-resistant cell lines. In pharmacodynamic studies in multiple tumor models, ASN003 showed strong inhibition of the phosphorylation of downstream targets of B-RAF and PI3K, confirming appropriate target engagement. In in vivo efficacy studies, ASN003 showed strong tumor growth inhibition or regression in multiple tumor xenograft models, including A375 (B-Raf V600E mutation), RKO (B-Raf V600E and PIK3CA mutations), and A2058 (B-Raf V600E mutation and PTEN loss). We now report that ASN003 also showed strong tumor growth inhibition (>80%) in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model established from a relapsed patient with progressive B-Raf mutant melanoma who showed initial response to vemurafenib. Sequencing analysis showed that the vemurafenib resistant tumor acquired a concurrent PIK3CA mutation. Dual targeting of the B-RAF and PI3K pathways with ASN003 has the potential to treat and/or prevent the acquired resistance to selective B-RAF inhibitors, and may also treat a broader patient population and provide greater efficacy and survival benefit than selective B-RAF inhibitors or selective PI3K pathway inhibitors alone. ASN003 is currently in Phase I clinical development in patients with advanced solid tumors, including tumors with B-Raf V600 mutation, PI3 kinase pathway alterations or PTEN loss.']",

        "Background":"['Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is the most common bladder cancer in humans and their canine companions. Canine TCCs are usually papillary infiltrative TCCs of intermediate to high grade. Genetic defects identified in human TCCs aid in the diagnosis and therapy of human bladder cancer. We utilized whole exome sequencing to screen canine TCCs for gene mutations that contribute to pathogenesis. Genomic DNA was isolated from 11 canine TCCs, 3 matched normal tissue samples, and 2 canine TCC cell lines. Whole exome capture was conducted using the Canine Agilent Sure-select in-solution capture system, and captured fragments were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. The sequences were mapped to the CanFam3.1 canine reference genome and somatic mutations were identified using Freebayes. Somatic mutations were characterized and compared to the Cancer Gene Census (COSMIC). Nonsense, missense, and insertion/deletion mutations were identified in 126 genes shown to be drivers or repressors in human cancer. Missense mutations were further screened using SIFT to identify alterations deleterious to protein function. The genes exhibiting in/dels, nonsense, or missense mutations with SIFT scores < 0.45 in at least 2 sites or 2 samples were', ' BRAF, RPL5, RANBP2, EWSR1, NONO, PTPRB, LYL1, JAK1, MSH2, PER1, PIM1, and WRN. In fact, an activating BRAF V to E mutation was identified in 5 of the tumors and both cell lines. The RPL5 and RANBP2 mutations were also hotspot mutations identified in 5 and 3 of the samples, respectively. Mutations were confirmed using Sanger sequencing of amplified genomic DNA. Interestingly, deleterious RANBP2 mutations were only observed in non-BRAF mutant samples. Drug sensitivity assays using the BRAF V600E targeting drug, Vemurafenib, were conducted in the BRAF mutant canine cell lines as well as the BRAF mutant human A375 melanoma cell line. As previously described, the IC50 for the sensitive A375 line was approximately 100 nM, while each of the BRAF mutant canine lines had an IC50 value  10 M. Reverse transcriptase PCR was used to amplify the coding sequence for BRAF from the Bliley canine TCC cell line. The amplified transcript (2125 bp) was sequenced, confirming the heterozygous expression of the V548 to E mutant form of BRAF in this cell line. The sequence also indicated that the predicted expressed protein (AA 10 - 715 of XP_013975364.1, corresponding to predicted exons 1 through 20 of XM_014119889.1) exhibited 99% homology to human BRAF AA53 - 763 (NP_004324.2). BRAF protein expression in these cell lines was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Thus, insensitivity to Vemurafenib is not due to differences in canine BRAF, reduced expression, or alternative splicing of the expressed transcript as previously observed in some Vemurafenib resistant human melanomas. These data indicate that although constitutively active BRAF is expressed in canine TCC, other factors may contribute to pathogenesis.']",

Methods', '  We assessed cell growth inhibition, apoptosis and cell signaling changes by inhibitors of BRAF (dabrafenib, D), MEK (trametinib, T), and EGFR (panitumumab, P, cetuximab, and erlotinib) dosed as monotherapies and in combination in five BRAFV600E human CRC lines (Colo205, HT29, RKO, SW1417 and LS411N). Further, these inhibitors were evaluated for their anti-tumor effects either alone or in combination in two BRAFV600E CRC patient derived tumor xenografts (PDXs) established in female nude mice. One patient-derived xenograft (PDX) harbored the PIK3CAH1047R mutation (Co-018) and the other (Co-012) was wildtype for PIK3CA. Results', ' In three out of five lines, all three EGFR inhibitors enhanced cell growth inhibition by D and the combination of D/T. Adding P to D or to the combination of D/T led to sustained suppression of pERK. The triple combination of P/D/T most effectively inhibited both pERK and pS6, and increased PARP cleavage in HT29 cells. P significantly improved the efficacy of either D or D/T in the Co-012 and Co-018 models. The triple combination of P/D/T was highly efficacious in both PDXs, and more effectively delayed tumor growth than the combination of P/D or D/T in Co-018 model, while D and P alone showed little or no activity.

Methods', '  Pts with stage IIIc/IV BRAF V600E /K mutationpositive MM and 1 prior treatments are eligible. Dose escalation occurs in cohorts of 3-6 pts followed by expansion (30 pts) at the RP2D. At data cutoff (Nov 8, 2013), 10 pts were enrolled', ' 4 received D+Ipi (doublet), 2 received D only (withdrawn before Ipi treatment), and 4 received D+T+Ipi (triplet).  Results', '  Median age of the10 pts was 59.5 y (range, 32-75 y). Doublet', ' D 150 mg bid + Ipi 3 mg/kg q3w  4 doses was well tolerated and selected as RP2D. No G3/4 ALT elevations or dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed. The most frequent adverse events (AEs; 2) were chills, fatigue, hand-foot syndrome, pyrexia, and maculopapular rash. Of 4 pts, 2 are ongoing and 2 stopped treatment (disease progression). Pts are currently being enrolled at this dose level in the expansion. Triplet', ' At current doses (D 100 mg bid/T 1 mg qd+Ipi 3 mg/kg q3w  4), no G3/4 ALT elevations and 1 DLT (G3 colitis; associated with Ipi) occurred. The most frequent AEs (2) were pyrexia, chills, arthralgia, insomnia, and maculopapular rash. One pt had G4 renal insufficiency that reversed rapidly. Of 4 pts treated, 1 stopped treatment (DLT), and 3 are ongoing. Updated safety data and preliminary efficacy data will be presented for both cohorts.  Conclusions', '  To date the combinations of D+Ipi and D+T+Ipi appear to be tolerable and have not been associated with significant hepatotoxicity in MM, suggesting differences between BRAF inhibitors when combined with Ipi.

        "Background":"['Signal transduction in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) pathway plays a key role in cell survival, growth and proliferation. The pathway is controlled by extracellular signals through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and is activated by oncogenic mutations in many types of cancer. K-RAS mutation has been reported in 40% of colorectal cancer patients. These patients have acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Therefore, there is a need for the development of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of these cancers. The B-RAF selective inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of human melanoma with a B-RAF V600E mutation. However, B-RAF specific inhibitor activates C-RAF in RAS mutant cells by inducing RAF dimer formation and paradoxical activation of C-RAF. These observations require the development of pan-RAF inhibitors without inducing paradoxical activation. In addition, as VEGFR2 represents one crucial promoter of tumor angiogenesis in colorectal cancer, the inhibition of VEGFR2 has been expected to be synergistic for the treatment of colorectal cancer.Therefore, we tried to find dual inhibitors of pan-RAF and VEGFR2 using structure based molecular modeling and identified a selective inhibitor, C1005, which binds to the DFG-out inactive conformation of B-RAF. In addition, C1005 potentially inhibited B-RAF, C-RAF, B-RAF V600E and VEGFR2 with IC50 value of 2.7 nM, 0.7 nM, 5.2 nM and 11nM, respectively. C1005 completely inhibited the phosphorylation of MEK-ERK without paradoxical activation in K-RAS mutant cells compared with Vemurafenib and Regorafenib. We examined the effects of C1005 on cell proliferation of colorectal cancer cells with K-RAS or B-RAF mutation. C1005 displayed potent anti-proliferative activities not only in K-RAS mutant colorectal cancer cells but also in B-RAF mutant colorectal cancer cells. C1005 effectively blocked cell proliferation of HCT-116, LS-513 and WiDr at EC50 of 145 nM, 79 nM and 636 nM, respectively. In addition, growth inhibition of VEGF-stimulated HUVEC indicates that C1005 is a potent inhibitor of the angiogenesis. To study in vivo effect, we tested C1005 in colorectal cancer xenografts with mutant K-RAS. Oral treatment of animals bearing xenograft tumors by 30 and 60 mg/kg, twice daily (BID) of C1005, induced a dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition. We observed 77% and 89% reduction of tumor volume, respectively.In this study, we discovered an orally active dual inhibitor of pan-RAF and VEGFR2. C1005 has been shown to suppress mutant K-RAS colorectal cancer cells without activating the MAPK pathway. Our findings suggest that C1005 could be an excellent preclinical candidate to treat mutant K-RAS driven colorectal cancer.']",

        "Background":"['BackgroundThe most common activating B-raf mutations (T1799A point mutation) lead to a substitution of valine (V) to glutamic acid (E) at the position 600 of the amino acid sequence. This oncogenic mutation in the B-raf gene constitutively activates the MAPK signaling pathway which results in increased proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. B-raf V600E mutation was described in approximately 8% of all solid tumors (43% melanomas, 39-67% papillary thyroid carcinomas and 12% colorectal adenocarcinomas). Currently, the gold standard to identify B-raf mutations is sequencing of the tumor DNA. However this method is not practical for routine clinical detection due high risk of contamination and low sensitivity. Recent development of therapeutic intervention using B-raf inhibitors requires an accurate and rapid detection system for B-raf mutations.MethodsHere we developed a new methodology for the rapid and reliable detection of B-raf (V600) mutations by combination of the modified real-time PCR primers, peptide nucleic acid (PNA) clamping and MGB probe, named of PM-PCR method. In this assay, the mutant gene is selectively amplified by the modified PCR primers and the amplicon extending signals are collected by the taqman-MGB probe in a real-time fashion, while the amplification of wild-type B-raf DNA is completely blocked by the specifically designed PNA with a higher annealing temperature. The assay procedure includes only one step of sample loading to avoid potential contamination. The PM-PCR method can detect 3-10 copies of the mutant gene stably in somatic cells with background of a total of 10ng wild-type genomic DNA.Tumor samples from 97 patients with malignant melanoma (N=20) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (N=78) were evaluated for the B-raf V600mutation. Genomic DNA was extracted from FFPE tissue sections and analyzed by PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing for comparison.ResultsAmong the 97 tested samples, 74% (72/97) of them were positive for B-raf V600 mutation detected by our ARMS-PM assay, while 60.8% (59/97) were detected positive by Sanger sequencing. All the 25 negative cases detected by our assay were confirmed by Sanger sequencing with a concordance rate 100% (25/25). The overall concordance between our assay and Sanger sequencing was (87%) .ConclusionWe have developed a new method for detection of B-raf V600 mutation by combination of the modified real-time PCR primers, PNA and MGB probes (PM-PCR method). The new assay demonstrates significantly improved sensitivity and feasibility for clinical application. <!EndFragment>']",
