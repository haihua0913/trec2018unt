To evaluate the prognostic significance of IDH1 mutations in AML, we performed a meta-analysis. Fifteen studies covering a total of 8121 subjects were included in this analysis. The frequency of IDH1 R132 mutations were 4.4-9.3% for AML patients and 10.9-16.0% for cytogenetically normal (CN)-AML patients. The IDH1 mutations were associated with NPM1 mutations in 6 studies and normal cytogenetics in 5 studies. AML patients with IDH1 mutations had inferior overall survival compared to patients without the mutations (hazard ratio 1.17, 95% CI: 1.02-1.36). Additionally, in CN-AML patients, IDH1 mutations were associated with a lower complete remission rate (risk ratio 1.30, 95% CI: 1.04-1.63). Although the available literature is limited to observational studies, these results may justify the risk-adapted therapeutic strategies for AML according to the IDH1 status.",

We report the development of new allosteric inhibitors of mutant IDH1. Crystallographic and biochemical results demonstrated that compounds of this chemical series bind to an allosteric site and lock the enzyme in a catalytically inactive conformation, thereby enabling inhibition of different clinically relevant IDH1 mutants. Treatment of IDH1 mutant primary AML cells uniformly led to a decrease in intracellular 2-HG, abrogation of the myeloid differentiation block and induction of granulocytic differentiation at the level of leukemic blasts and more immature stem-like cells, in vitro and in vivo. Molecularly, treatment with the inhibitors led to a reversal of the DNA cytosine hypermethylation patterns caused by mutant IDH1 in the cells of individuals with AML. Our study provides proof of concept for the molecular and biological activity of novel allosteric inhibitors for targeting different mutant forms of IDH1 in leukemia. ",

In this study, we screened the IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in a cohort of 456 Chinese patients with various hematological malignancies and disorders. We found three missense (p.R132C, p.R132G, and p.I99M; occurred in five patients) and one silent mutation (c.315C>T; occurred in two patients) in the IDH1 gene and two missense mutations (p.R140Q and p.R172K; occurred in four AML patients) and one silent mutation (c.435G>A) in the IDH2 gene. Except for one non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patient harboring IDH1 mutation p.R132C, all IDH1 and IDH2 missense mutations were observed in patients with AML. Intriguingly, the IDH2 mutation p.R140Q and novel IDH1 mutation p.I99M co-occurred in a 75-year-old patient with AML developed from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The frequency of IDH1 and IDH2 missense mutations in Chinese AML patients reached 5.9% and 8.3%, respectively. Our results supported the recent findings that IDH gene mutations were common in AML.

To investigate their prognostic significance we determined IDH1 status in 1333 young adult patients, excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia, treated in the United Kingdom MRC AML10 and 12 trials. A mutation was detected in 107 patients (8%). Most IDH1(+) patients (91%) had intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Mutations correlated significantly with an NPM1 mutation (P < .0001) but not a FLT3/ITD (P = .9). No difference in outcome between IDH1(+) and IDH1(-) patients was found in univariate or multivariate analysis, or if the results were stratified by NPM1 mutation status. However, when stratified by FLT3/ITD status, an IDH1 mutation was an independent adverse factor for relapse in FLT3/ITD(-) patients (P = .008) and a favorable factor in FLT3/ITD(+) patients (P = .02). These results suggest that metabolic changes induced by an IDH1 mutation may influence chemoresistance in a manner that is context-dependent.",

The IDH mutation was detected by using directly sequencing method for PCR product. The results indicated that among 90 de novo AML patients, 4 patients (4.4%) showed the IDH1 gene mutation positive, and 7(7.8%) patients showed IDH2 gene mutation positive. None was found harboring both mutations, the overall rate of mutation positive of them was 12.2%. In the AML patients with IDH gene mutation positive, the rate of normal karyotype was 72.7%, which was significantly higher than that in abnormality karyotype. The CR rate in mutation positive patients was 72.7%, which seemed as if higher than that in mutation negative patients, but without statistical significance. The mutation disappeared when the patients gained CR, and reappeared in same loci after relapse occurred.

        "Doc_abstract":"PURPOSE To analyze the frequency and associations with prognostic markers and outcome of mutations in IDH genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenases in adult de novo cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS Diagnostic bone marrow or blood samples from 358 patients were analyzed for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations by DNA polymerase chain reaction amplification/sequencing. FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, WT1, and MLL mutational analyses and gene- and microRNA-expression profiling were performed centrally. Results IDH mutations were found in 33% of the patients. IDH1 mutations were detected in 49 patients (14%; 47 with R132). IDH2 mutations, previously unreported in AML, were detected in 69 patients (19%; 13 with R172 and 56 with R140). R172 IDH2 mutations were mutually exclusive with all other prognostic mutations analyzed. Younger age (< 60 years), molecular low-risk (NPM1-mutated/FLT3-internal tandem duplication-negative) IDH1-mutated patients had shorter disease-free survival than molecular low-risk IDH1/IDH2-wild-type (wt) patients (P = .046). R172 IDH2-mutated patients had lower complete remission rates than IDH1/IDH2wt patients (P = .007). Distinctive microarray gene- and microRNA-expression profiles accurately predicted R172 IDH2 mutations. The highest expressed gene and microRNAs in R172 IDH2-mutated patients compared with the IDH1/IDH2wt patients were APP (previously associated with complex karyotype AML) and miR-1 and miR-133 (involved in embryonal stem-cell differentiation), respectively. CONCLUSION IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are recurrent in CN-AML and have an unfavorable impact on outcome. The R172 IDH2 mutations, previously unreported in AML, characterize a novel subset of CN-AML patients lacking other prognostic mutations and associate with unique gene- and microRNA-expression profiles that may lead to the discovery of novel, therapeutically targetable leukemogenic mechanisms.",

Mutational analysis was performed with polymerase chain reaction-based assay followed by direct sequencing. One hundred seventeen of 206 patients (56.8%) had at least one mutation: 51% class I, 13% class II, 6.8% class III, and 5.6% class IV. FLT3-internal tandem duplication was most frequent, and 29% of patients had more than one gene mutation.

The exon 4 of IDH1 and IDH2 were amplified using polymerase chain reaction and sequenced for detection of mutations.;IDH1 mutations were detected in 18 of 211 AML patients (8.5%) in the form of 8 cases, R132H; 6 cases, R132C; 2 cases, R132S; 1 case, R132G; and 1 case, R132V mutations). IDH2 mutations were detected in 22 of 211 AML patients (10.4%) in the form of 20 cases, R140Q; and 2 cases, R172K mutations. The overall survival after correction for nucleophosmin 1 and fims- related tyrosine kinase internal tandem duplication was significantly shorter in AML patients with the IDH mutation compared with those with wild type (P = .02).;IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are negative prognostic markers in AML patients.

        "Doc_abstract":"Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is highly heterogeneous clonal hematological malignancy, having a high rate of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). With the rapid development of molecular biological techniques, plenty of gene mutations were found to have close relationships with the transformation from MDS to AML. SRSF2 is a RNA splicing-related gene, which mutation may prompt a poor prognosis, and have a higher rate of progressing to AML. DNMT3A plays an important role in DNA methylation, its mutation often indicate a worse overall survival and a more rapid progression to AML. ASXL1 regulates the synthesis of histone, which frameshift mutations are molecular marks of an adverse outcome. IDH contains IDH1 and IDH2, which are related with the Krebs cycle. Patients with IDH1 mutation have a shorter overall survival and a higher risk of AML transformation than that of patients with wild-type IDH1, while IDH2 was a poor prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with lower-risk MDS. Another gene related with DNA methylation is TET2, which is the most frequently mutated gene in MDS known so far and it may act as tumor-suppressor gene, but the opinions on its impact on patients' outcomes are still controversial. Some studies show that its mutations relate to a shorter time to progression to AML. Because of the differentiations in patients' races, regions and clinical characteristics, the results of different studies are varied. In this review, the recent advances on these related genes are summarized. ",

However, the effect of R-2HG released by IDH-mutated AML cells on the bone marrow microenvironment is unclear. Here, we report that R-2HG induces IκB kinase-independent activation of NF-κB in bone marrow stromal cells. R-2HG acts via a reactive oxygen species/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway to phosphorylate NF-κB on the Thr254 residue. This phosphorylation enhances the interaction of NF-κB and the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase PIN1 and increases the protein stability and transcriptional activity of NF-κB. As a consequence, R-2HG enhances NF-κB-dependent expression of cytokines including IL-6, IL-8 and complement 5a to stimulate proliferation of AML cells. In addition, R-2HG also upregulates vascular endothelial adhesion molecule 1 and CXCR4 in stromal cells to enhance the contact between AML and stromal cells and attenuates chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. More importantly, we validated the R-2HG-activated gene signature in the primary bone marrow stromal cells isolated from IDH-mutated AML patients. Collectively, our results suggest that AML cell-derived R-2HG may be helpful for the establishment of a supportive bone marrow stromal niche to promote AML progression via paracrine stimulation. ",

Because mutant IDH has no necessary functions in normal cells, inhibitors directed against mutant IDH are not expected to have the side effects as anti-cancer agents. To determine whether mutant IDH enzymes are valid targets for cancer therapy, we created a mouse model of mutant IDH2-dependent AML. By using a combination of AML model mice with cre-loxp, we conditionally deleted mutant IDH2 from AML mice, which resulted in the loss of leukemia stem cells and significantly delayed the progression of AML.

Structural modeling of IDH2 suggested that codon 140 mutations disrupt the enzyme's ability to bind its substrate isocitrate. Accordingly, recombinant IDH2 R140Q/W were unable to carry out the decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), but instead gained the neomorphic activity to reduce α-KG to R(-)-2-hydroxyglutarete (2-HG).

Patients with isolated DNMT3A mutations were seen in 4 cases (9%), isolated IDH mutations in 5 (11.1%), while interestingly, two cases showed both DNMT3A and IDH mutations (4.3%). Nucleotide sequencing of DNMT3A revealed missense mutations (R882H and R882C), while that of IDH revealed R172K, R140Q, R132H and R132S. Both DNMT3A and IDH mutations were observed only in adults, with a higher frequency in males. DNMT3A and IDH mutations were significantly associated with NPM1, while trends towards higher coexistence with FLT3 mutations were observed. This is the first study to evaluate DNMT3A/ IDH mutations in Indian patients. Significant associations among the various molecular markers was observed, that highlights cooperation between them and possible roles in improved risk stratification. ",

Over a 6-month period of clinical testing with a targeted next-generation sequencing assay, we evaluated 92 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and identified a subset of 21 patients (23%) who harbored mutations in either IDH1 or IDH2. Of the 21 patients with IDH mutations, 4 (19%) were found to have single nucleotide variants in both IDH1 and IDH2. An additional patient included in the study was found to have two different IDH2 mutations. The mutations were typically present at different variant allelic frequencies, with one predominating over the other, consistent with the presence of multiple subclones in a single patient. In one case, the variant allelic frequencies in both IDH1 and IDH2 were equally low in the setting of a high percentage of blasts, suggesting that the IDH mutations were unlikely to be present in the founding clone. Given these data, we conclude that dual IDH1/2 mutations likely were previously underestimated, a finding that may carry important treatment implications. ",

We found that BPTES only suppressed the growth of AML cells expressing mutant IDH compared with those expressing wild type IDH.

Although genetic alterations are increasingly reported in AML, the gene mutations have not been comprehensively studied in AML-M0. We aimed to examine a wide spectrum of gene mutations in patients with AML-M0 to determine their clinical relevance. Twenty gene mutations including class I, class II, class III of epigenetic regulators (IDH1, IDH2, TET2, DNMT3A, MLL-PTD, ASXL1, and EZH2), and class IV (tumor suppressor genes) were analyzed in 67 patients with AML-M0. Mutational analysis was performed with polymerase chain reaction-based assays followed by direct sequencing. The most frequent gene mutations from our data were FLT3-ITD/FLT3-TKD (28.4%), followed by mutations in IDH1/IDH2 (28.8%), RUNX1 (23.9%), N-RAS/K-RAS (12.3%), TET2 (8.2%), DNMT3A (8.1%), MLL-PTD (7.8%), and ASXL1 (6.3%). Seventy-nine percent (53/67) of patients had at least one gene mutation. Class I genes (49.3%) were the most common mutated genes, which were mutually exclusive. Class III genes of epigenetic regulators were also frequent (43.9%). In multivariate analysis, old age [hazard ratio (HR) 1.029, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.013-1.044, P=.001) was the independent adverse factor for overall survival, and RUNX1 mutation (HR 2.326, 95% CI 0.978-5.533, P=.056) had a trend toward inferior survival. In conclusion, our study showed a high frequency of FLT3, RUNX1, and IDH mutations in AML-M0, suggesting that these mutations played a role in the pathogenesis and served as potential therapeutic targets in this rare and unfavorable subtype of AML.

Aberrant serum 2-HG pattern was detected in the multicenter group of AML, with 62 of 367 (17%) patients having 2-HG levels above the cutoff value (2.01, log2-transformed from 4.03 μg/mL). IDH1/2 mutations occurred in 27 of 31 (87%) AML cases with very high 2-HG, but were observed only in 9 of 31 (29%) patients with moderately high 2-HG, suggesting other genetic or biochemical events may exist in causing 2-HG elevation. Indeed, glutamine-related metabolites exhibited a pattern in favor of 2-HG synthesis in the high 2-HG group. In AML patients with cytogenetically normal AML (n = 234), high 2-HG represented a negative prognostic factor in both overall survival and event-free survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses confirmed high serum 2-HG as a strong prognostic predictor independent of other clinical and molecular features. We also demonstrated distinct gene-expression/DNA methylation profiles in AML blasts with high 2-HG compared with those with normal ones, supporting a role that 2-HG plays in leukemogenesis. ",

Of these cases, 79% showed at least one nonsynonymous mutation, and cases of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities showed a lower frequency of mutations versus AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (P<0.001). Mutational analysis further demonstrated that TP53 mutations are associated with complex karyotype AML, whereas ASXL1 and U2AF1 mutations are associated with AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. Furthermore, U2AF1 mutations were specifically associated with trilineage morphologic dysplasia. Univariate analysis demonstrated that U2AF1 and TP53 mutations are associated with absence of clinical remission, poor overall survival (OS), and poor disease-free survival (DFS; P<0.0001), whereas TET2 and ASXL1 mutations are associated with poor OS (P<0.03).

        "Doc_abstract":"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), which localizes to the cytosol and peroxisomes, catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and in parallel converts NADP(+) to NADPH. IDH1 mutations are frequently detected in grades 2-4 gliomas and in acute myeloid leukemias (AML). Mutations of IDH1 have been identified at codon 132, with arginine being replaced with histidine in most cases. Mutant IDH1 gains novel enzyme activity converting α-KG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) which acts as a competitive inhibitor of α-KG. As a result, the activity of α-KG-dependent enzyme is reduced. Based on these findings, 2-HG has been proposed to be an oncometabolite. In this study, we established HEK293 and U87 cells that stably expressed IDH1-WT and IDH1-R132H and investigated the effect of glutaminase inhibition on cell proliferation with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON). We found that cell proliferation was suppressed in IDH1-R132H cells. The addition of α-KG restored cell proliferation. The metabolic features of 33 gliomas with wild type IDH1 (IDH1-WT) and with IDH1-R132H mutation were examined by global metabolome analysis using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS). We showed that the 2-HG levels were highly elevated in gliomas with IDH1-R132H mutation. Intriguingly, in gliomas with IDH1-R132H, glutamine and glutamate levels were significantly reduced which implies replenishment of α-KG by glutaminolysis. Based on these results, we concluded that glutaminolysis is activated in gliomas with IDH1-R132H mutation and that development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting activated glutaminolysis is warranted.

High expression of one of these genes, BRE, was observed in 3% of the cases and predicted favorable prognosis independently of known prognostic factors (5-year overall survival: 57%). Remarkably, unsupervised expression profiling showed that 86% of high BRE-expressing patients were confined to a previously unrecognized cluster. High BRE expression was mutually exclusive with FLT3 ITD, CEBPA, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations, EVI1 overexpression, and favorable karyotypes. In contrast, high BRE expression co-occurred strongly with FAB M5 morphology and MLL-AF9 fusions. Within the group of MLL-AF9-positive patients, high BRE expression predicted superior survival, while normal BRE expression predicted extremely poor survival (5-year overall survival of 80% vs 0%, respectively, P = .0002). Both the co-occurrence of high BRE expression with MLL-AF9 and its prognostic impact were confirmed in an independent cohort of 436 AML patients. Thus, high BRE expression defines a novel subtype of adult AML characterized by a favorable prognosis.

Among the 168 de novo myelodysplastic syndrome patients, the frequency of TET2, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations was 18.5%, 4.2% and 6.0%, respectively. TET2/IDH mutations had no impact on survivals, while TET2 mutations were significantly associated with rapid progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Seventeen of the 46 paired myelodysplastic syndrome/secondary acute myeloid leukemia samples harbored TET2/IDH mutations; none acquired these mutations in acute myeloid leukemia phase.

To date, mutations in the IDH1 gene have been found in numerous cancers with the highest frequencies occurring in gliomas, chondrosarcomas/enchondromas and cholangiocarcinomas.;IDH1 was first described in the scientific literature as early as 1950. Early researchers proposed that the enzyme likely functions in cellular lipid metabolism based on the observation that the enzymatic reaction produces NADPH and partially localizes to peroxisomes. This article highlights the studies implicating IDH1 in cytoplasmic and peroxisomal lipid metabolism from the early researchers to the recent studies examining mutant IDH1(R132), the most common IDH1 mutation found in cancer.;While a role for IDH1 in lipid biosynthesis in the liver and adipose tissue is now established, a role in lipid metabolism in the brain and tumors is beginning to be examined. The recent discoveries that IDH1(R132H) interferes with the metabolism of phospholipids in gliomas and that IDH1 activity could participate in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from glutamine in hypoxic tumors highlight roles for IDH1 in lipid metabolism in a broad spectrum of tissues.;Interferences in cytoplasmic and peroxisomal lipid metabolism by IDH1(R132) may contribute to the more favorable clinical outcome in patients whose tumors express mutations in the IDH1 gene.",

Finally, targeting of energy and protein metabolism is considered, the most promising strategy being inhibition of isocitrate dehydrogenase in patients with IDH mutations.

We detected IDH1R132 mutations in 93 of 1414 patients (6.6%) with a clear prevalence in intermediate risk karyotype group (10.4%, P < .001). Although IDH1R132 mutations can incidentally occur together with all other molecular markers, there were strong associations with NPM1 mutations (14.2% vs 5.4% in NPM1wt, P < .001) and MLL-PTD (18.2% vs 7.0% in MLLwt, P = .020). IDH1-mutated cases more often had AML without maturation/French-American-British M1 (P < .001), an immature immunophenotype, and female sex (8.7% vs 4.7% in male, P = .003) compared with IDH1wt cases. Prognosis was adversely affected by IDH1 mutations with trend for shorter overall survival (P = .110), a shorter event-free survival (P < .003) and a higher cumulative risk for relapse (P = .001). IDH1 mutations were of independent prognostic relevance for event-free survival (P = .039) especially in the age group < 60 years (P = .028).

Herein we investigated the functional role of miR-199b in AML and its prognostic implications.;Major approaches include transduction of hematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow transplantation, analyses of blood lineages, histone deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors, and molecular and clinical data analyses of AML patients using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).;We first examined the relative miR-199b expression in steady state hematopoiesis and showed CD33(+) myeloid progenitors had the highest miR-199b expression. Further, silencing of miR-199b in CD34(+) cells resulted in significant increases in CFU-GM colonies. Via TCGA we analyzed the molecular and clinical characteristics of 166 AML cases to investigate a prognostic role for miR-199b. The Kaplan-Meier curves for high and low expression values of miR-199b and the observed distribution of miRNA expression revealed the highly expressed group had significantly better survival outcomes (p < 0.016, log rank test). Additionally, there was significant difference between miR-199b expression across the AML subtypes with particularly low expression found in the FAB-M5 subtype. Furthermore, FAB-M5 subtype showed a poor prognosis with a 1-year survival rate of only 25 %, compared with 51 % survival in the overall sample (p < 0.024). Furthermore, significant inverse correlation of HoxA7 and HoxB6 expression with miR-199b was observed in FAB-M5 AML patients. Molecular mutations were analyzed among miR-199b high and low AML cases. Significant correlations in terms of association and survival outcomes were observed for NPMc and IDH1 mutations. Treatment of THP-1 cells (represents M5-subtype) with HDAC inhibitors AR-42, Panobinostat, or Decitabine showed miR-199b expression was significantly elevated upon AR-42 and Panobinostat treatment. To further understand the hematopathological consequences of decreased miR-199b, we employed a bone-marrow transduce/transplant (BMT) mouse model. Interestingly, in vivo miR-199b silencing per-se in HSCs did not result in profound perturbations.;Loss of miR-199b can lead to myeloproliferation while HDAC inhibitors restore miR-199b expression and promote apoptosis.

Inhibitors of the neomorphic activity of mutant IDH1 and IDH2 are currently in Phase I/II clinical trials for both solid and blood tumors. As IDH1 and IDH2 represent key enzymes within the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, mutations have significant impact on intermediary metabolism. The loss of some wild-type metabolic activity is an important, potentially deleterious and therapeutically exploitable consequence of oncogenic IDH mutations and requires continued investigation in the future.

The results showed that IDH1 mutation was detected in 9 (4.39%) of 205 AML patients. There were 6 cases of R132H mutation, 1 of R132L mutation, 1 of R132G mutation and 1 of R132S mutation.

Here we provide an overview of the function of normal and mutated IDH, discuss the role of IDH mutations in tumorigenesis and progression and review the key clinical considerations when treating IDH-mutated tumors based on emerging clinical data from mutant IDH1/2 inhibitor trials. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations confer neomorphic activity in the mutant protein, resulting in the conversion of αKG to the oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). The subsequent accumulation of 2-HG results in epigenetic dysregulation via inhibition of αKG-dependent histone and DNA demethylases, and a block in cellular differentiation. There is growing preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting that IDHmutations are involved in neoplasia. Furthermore, preclinical studies assessing small molecule inhibitors of mutant IDH1/2 enzymes have provided proof of concept that this approach decreases intracellular 2-HG levels, reverses epigenetic dysregulation and induces cellular differentiation. Phase I studies of mutant IDH inhibitors are currently ongoing in patients with IDH-mutant hematologic and solid tumors, with early data in hematologic tumors suggesting a manageable safety profile as well as clinical benefit, with a mechanism of action based on differentiation of malignant cells. Inhibition of mutant IDH shows promise as a treatment approach in hematologic malignancies, with further development ongoing in solid tumors and glioma.

However, the incidence of IDH mutations in acute myeloid leukemia in Taiwan is much lower than that reported in Western countries. The reason for the difference is unknown and its clinical implications remain unclear. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogenous hematopoietic malignancy. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) results from chronic carcinogen exposures and is highly prevalent in trucking workers, especially in southern Taiwan. Subtypes of both diseases require specific treatments, and molecular markers for developing tailored treatments are limited. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis is now a widely used methodology for rapid, accurate, and low-cost mutation scanning. In this study, 90 adults with OSC and 31 children with ALL were scanned by HRM analysis for IDH1 and IDH2 mutation hot spots. In ALL, the allele frequency was 3.23% in both IDH1 and IDH2. In OSCC, the allele frequency was 2.22% in IDH2. A synonymous mutation over pG313 (c.939A > G) of IDH2 was found in both pediatric ALL and adult OSCC.

FLT3/TKD mutations are generally missense mutations or in-frame alterations of residues D835 and I836 within the activation loop of the FLT3 protein. D835 mutations have been reported to occur in ≈ 7% of AML patients. Mutations have also been reported in exon 4 of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) in ≈9% of AML patients. Mutations in FLT3/TKD and IDH1 genes were studied in AML patients from Pakistan and correlated with the laboratory findings. FLT3/TKD mutations were found in 7%, while IDH1 mutations were found in 10% Pakistani AML patients. Neither of these mutations was significantly correlated with age and sex, although the incidence of these mutations was higher in female patients. These mutations were found to be positively associated with each other. IDH1 mutations were positively associated with FAB type M1 and negatively associated with FAB type M2.

Here we show that heterozygous expression of the IDH1(R132H) allele is sufficient to induce the genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation characteristic of these tumors. Using a gene-targeting approach, we knocked-in a single copy of the most frequently observed IDH1 mutation, R132H, into a human cancer cell line and profiled changes in DNA methylation at over 27,000 CpG dinucleotides relative to wild-type parental cells. We find that IDH1(R132H/WT) mutation induces widespread alterations in DNA methylation, including hypermethylation of 2010 and hypomethylation of 842 CpG loci. We demonstrate that many of these alterations are consistent with those observed in IDH1-mutant and G-CIMP+ primary gliomas and can segregate IDH wild-type and mutated tumors as well as those exhibiting the G-CIMP phenotype in unsupervised analysis of two primary glioma cohorts. Further, we show that the direction of IDH1(R132H/WT)-mediated DNA methylation change is largely dependent upon preexisting DNA methylation levels, resulting in depletion of moderately methylated loci. Additionally, whereas the levels of multiple histone H3 and H4 methylation modifications were globally increased, consistent with broad inhibition of histone demethylation, hypermethylation at H3K9 in particular accompanied locus-specific DNA hypermethylation at several genes down-regulated in IDH1(R132H/WT) knock-in cells. These data provide insight on epigenetic alterations induced by IDH1 mutations and support a causal role for IDH1(R132H/WT) mutants in driving epigenetic instability in human cancer cells.",

We validated our prognostic findings in an independent set of 104 patients.;We identified at least one somatic alteration in 97.3% of the patients. We found that internal tandem duplication in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD), partial tandem duplication in MLL (MLL-PTD), and mutations in ASXL1 and PHF6 were associated with reduced overall survival (P=0.001 for FLT3-ITD, P=0.009 for MLL-PTD, P=0.05 for ASXL1, and P=0.006 for PHF6); CEBPA and IDH2 mutations were associated with improved overall survival (P=0.05 for CEBPA and P=0.01 for IDH2). The favorable effect of NPM1 mutations was restricted to patients with co-occurring NPM1 and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. We identified genetic predictors of outcome that improved risk stratification among patients with AML, independently of age, white-cell count, induction dose, and post-remission therapy, and validated the significance of these predictors in an independent cohort. High-dose daunorubicin, as compared with standard-dose daunorubicin, improved the rate of survival among patients with DNMT3A or NPM1 mutations or MLL translocations (P=0.001) but not among patients with wild-type DNMT3A, NPM1, and MLL (P=0.67).;We found that DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations and MLL translocations predicted an improved outcome with high-dose induction chemotherapy in patients with AML.

IDH1/2 mutations are heterozygous, and affect a single arginine residue. Recently, IDH1 mutations were identified in 8% of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients. A glioma study revealed that IDH1 mutations cause a gain-of-function, resulting in the production and accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Genotyping of 145 AML biopsies identified 11 IDH1 R132 mutant samples. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolite screening revealed increased 2-HG levels in IDH1 R132 mutant cells and sera, and uncovered two IDH2 R172K mutations. IDH1/2 mutations were associated with normal karyotypes. Recombinant IDH1 R132C and IDH2 R172K proteins catalyze the novel nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) to 2-HG. The IDH1 R132C mutation commonly found in AML reduces the affinity for isocitrate, and increases the affinity for NADPH and alpha-KG. This prevents the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-KG, and facilitates the conversion of alpha-KG to 2-HG. IDH1/2 mutations confer an enzymatic gain of function that dramatically increases 2-HG in AML. This provides an explanation for the heterozygous acquisition of these mutations during tumorigenesis. 2-HG is a tractable metabolic biomarker of mutant IDH1/2 enzyme activity.",

A total of 826 patients treated from 2010 to 2014 at a single institution were evaluated, including 167 patients (20%) with AML and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. Median age was 62 years (range 18-92). There were 59 IDH1-R132, 83 IDH2-R140, and 23 IDH2-R172 mutations. Clinicopathologic characteristics associated with IDH-mutations included older age, less frequent therapy-related status, and increased incidence of intermediate-risk cytogenetics, FLT3-ITD mutations, and NPM1 mutations. Remission rates (CR/CRi) by AML treatment status were: induction, 68%; Salvage-1 (S1), 42%; and Salvage-2 and beyond (S2+), 27%. No difference in response was identified by IDH mutation status. Similarly, overall survival (OS) was not dependent on IDH status within any cohort. The median OS was 15.4 months in induction, 8.7 months in S1, and 4.8 months in S2+. This analysis defines the clinical outcome associated with IDH-mutations in both the front-line and salvage AML treatment settings, and confirms that response rate and OS for both IDH-mutated and IDH wild-type AML patients is comparable.

Most notably, cytosolic IDH1 is mutated in 70-90% of low-grade gliomas and upgraded glioblastomas, and mitochondrial IDH2 is mutated in ~20% of acute myeloid leukemia cases. Wild-type IDH catalyzes the interconversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). Mutations in the enzyme lead to loss of wild-type enzymatic activity and a neomorphic activity that converts α-KG to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). In turn, 2-HG, which has been termed an \"oncometabolite,\" inhibits key α-KG-dependent enzymes, resulting in alterations of the cellular epigenetic profile and, subsequently, inhibition of differentiation and initiation of tumorigenesis. In addition, it is now clear that the IDH mutation also induces a broad metabolic reprograming that extends beyond 2-HG production, and this reprograming often differs from what has been previously reported in other cancer types. In this review, we will discuss in detail what is known to date about the metabolic reprograming of mutant IDH cells, and how this reprograming has been investigated using molecular metabolic imaging. We will describe how metabolic imaging has helped shed light on the basic biology of mutant IDH cells, and how this information can be leveraged to identify new therapeutic targets and to develop new clinically translatable imaging methods to detect and monitor mutant IDH tumors in vivo.

Both idh2 and idh1 monoallelic mutations are harbored in grade 2/3 gliomas, secondary glioblastomas and acute myeloid leukemia. Mutant IDH1/IDH2 enzymes were reported to form an oncometabolite r-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), further strengthening malignancy. We quantified CO2-dependent reductive carboxylation glutaminolysis (RCG) and CO2-independent 2HG production in HTB-126 and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells by measuring (13)C incorporation from 1-(13)C-glutamine into citrate, malate, and 2HG. For HTB-126 cells, (13)C-citrate, (13)C-malate, and (13)C-2-hydroxyglutarate were enriched by 2-, 5-, and 15-fold at 5mM glucose (2-, 2.5-, and 13-fold at 25 mM glucose), respectively, after 6 h. Such enrichment decreased by 6% with IDH1 silencing, but by 30-50% upon IDH2 silencing while cell respiration and ATP levels rose up to 150%. Unlike 2HG production RCG declined at decreasing CO2. At hypoxia (5% O2), IDH2-related and unrelated (13)C-accumulation into citrate and malate increased 1.5-2.5-fold with unchanged IDH2 expression; whereas hypoxic 2HG formation did not. (13)C-2HG originated by ∼50% from other than IDH2 or IDH1 reactions, substantiating remaining activity in IDH1&2-silenced cells. Relatively high basal (12)C-2HG levels existed (5-fold higher vs. non-tumor HTB-125 cells) and (13)C-2HG was formed despite the absence of any idh2 and idh1 mutations in HTB-126 cells. Since RCG is enhanced at hypoxia (frequent in solid tumors) and 2HG can be formed without idh1/2 mutations, we suggest 2HG as an analytic marker (in serum, urine, or biopsies) predicting malignancy of breast cancer in all patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Alterations to genes involved in cellular metabolism and epigenetic regulation are implicated in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. Recurring mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes are detected in approximately 20% of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 5% of adults with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). IDH proteins are homodimeric enzymes involved in diverse cellular processes, including adaptation to hypoxia, histone demethylation and DNA modification. The IDH2 protein is localized in the mitochondria and is a critical component of the tricarboxylic acid (also called the 'citric acid' or Krebs) cycle. Both IDH2 and IDH1 (localized in the cytoplasm) proteins catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). Mutant IDH enzymes have neomorphic activity and catalyze reduction of α-KG to the (R) enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate, which is associated with DNA and histone hypermethylation, altered gene expression and blocked differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The prognostic significance of mutant IDH (mIDH) is controversial but appears to be influenced by co-mutational status and the specific location of the mutation (IDH1-R132, IDH2-R140, IDH2-R172). Treatments specifically or indirectly targeted to mIDH are currently under clinical investigation; these therapies have been generally well tolerated and, when used as single agents, have shown promise for inducing responses in some mIDH patients when used as first-line treatment or in relapsed or refractory AML or MDS. Use of mIDH inhibitors in combination with drugs with non-overlapping mechanisms of action is especially promising, as such regimens may address the clonal heterogeneity and the multifactorial pathogenic processes involved in mIDH myeloid malignancies. Advances in mutational analysis have made testing more rapid and convenient, and less expensive; such testing should become part of routine diagnostic workup and repeated at relapse to identify patients who may benefit from treatments that target mIDH.Leukemia advance online publication, 11 November 2016; doi:10.1038/leu.2016.275.",

Determination of D2HG is of relevance to diagnosis and monitoring of disease. Standard detection methods of D2HG levels are liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry or gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry. Here we present a rapid, inexpensive and sensitive enzymatic assay for the detection of D2HG levels. The assay is based on the conversion of D2HG to α-ketoglutarate (αKG) in the presence of the enzyme (D)-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (HGDH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)). Determination of D2HG concentration is based on the detection of stoichiometrically generated NADH. The quantification limit of the enzymatic assay for D2HG in tumor tissue is 0.44 μM and in serum 2.77 μM. These limits enable detection of basal D2HG levels in human tumor tissues and serum without IDH mutations. Levels of D2HG in frozen and paraffin-embedded tumor tissues containing IDH mutations or in serum from acute myeloid leukemia patients with IDH mutations are significantly higher and can be easily identified with this assay. In conclusion, the assay presented is useful for differentiating basal from elevated D2HG levels in tumor tissue, serum, urine, cultured cells and culture supernatants.",

The multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were performed to screen 192 AML patients for exon 4 of the IDH2 gene. FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, c-kit and WT1 mutations were also included in analysis. The results showed that IDH2 mutation was found in 14 (7.29%) of 192 patients. There were 9 AML patients with R140Q mutation, 1 patient with R140W mutation, and 1 patient with R172K mutation. IDH2 aberrations significantly more were detected in French-American-British (FAB) M5 (P < 0.005) than other types. There was no statistical difference in age, sex, WBC, platelet count, bone marrow blasts count, hemoglobin as compared with IDH2 wild-type. For immunotype analysis, IDH2 mutation patients were more likely to express CD34 and CD13, less CD36. IDH2 mutation combined with FLT3/ITD mutation was found in 7 cases, with CEBPA mutation in 4 cases, with NPM1 mutation in 4 cases, with Dnmt3a mutation in 5 cases, neither with c-kit, IDH1 or WT1 mutation for no one, which revealed a significant interaction between IDH2 mutation and the FLT3/ITD positive genotype, Dnmt3a mutated, and IDH1 wild-type. IDH2 mutation was detected in 5 (8.47%) of 59 CN-AML. There was no significant difference of IDH2 mutation incidence between the normal and abnormal karyotype. The CR rate was higher in IDH2 R140 mutated patients than wild-type ones, but there was no significant in the two group. It is concluded that the rate of IDH2 mutation is 7.29% in Chinese AML patients and 7.81% in CN-AML. IDH2 mutation is significantly associated with AML-M5, FLT3/ITD, Dnmt3a, IDH1 wild-type and fusion gene wild-type, but not with age, leucocyte and platelet counts in peripheral blood, karyotype, NPM1, CEBPA, c-kit or WT1 mutation.

For acute myeloid leukemia (AML), this progress has been anchored in the increased understanding of genomic complexity. Multiple targets and the relationships among them pose new challenges along with new possibilities for the development of targeted therapies. A number of new drugs are in early clinical development for AML, one of which centers on the role of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) in malignancy. Epigenetic modulation, intracellular pathways, and the microenvironment are all being explored for possible therapies to treat AML. Dramatic clinical progress has also been made in therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with the rapid approval of blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engager antibody. Yet caution must also be exercised-not every mutation is an epigenetic target and early publication of clinical data is often misleading. Until the survival outcome for adult patients with acute leukemia improves, further inquiry into the biology of the disease and progress in the development of new therapies are needed. ",

We developed a facile and inexpensive fluorimetric microplate assay for the quantitation of 2HG and performed an unbiased small-molecule screen in live cells to identify compounds capable of perturbing 2HG production. Zaprinast, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, was identified as an efficacious modulator of 2HG production and confirmed to lower 2HG levels in vivo. The mechanism of action was not due to cGMP stabilization, but rather, profiling of metabolites upstream of mutant IDH1 pointed to targeted inhibition of the enzyme glutaminase (GLS). Zaprinast treatment reversed histone hypermethylation and soft-agar growth of IDH1-mutant cells, and treatment of glutamine-addicted pancreatic cancer cells reduced growth and sensitized cells to oxidative damage. Thus, Zaprinast is efficacious against glutamine metabolism and further establishes the therapeutic linkages between GLS and 2HG-mediated oncogenesis.;Gain-of-function IDH mutations are common events in glioma, acute myelogenous leukemia, and other cancer types, which lead to the accumulation of the oncometabolite 2HG. We show that the drug Zaprinast is capable of reducing cellular 2HG levels by inhibiting the upstream enzyme GLS, thus identifying a new strategy to target 2HG production in selected IDH-mutant cancers.",

As the inhibition for those tumor-associated mutant IDH proteins may induce differentiation of those cancer cells, these tumor-associated mutant IDH proteins can be treated as a drug target proteins for a differentiation therapy against cancers. In this study, we aim to identify the potent TCM compounds from the TCM Database@Taiwan as lead compounds of IDH2 R140Q mutant inhibitor. Comparing to the IDH2 R140Q mutant protein inhibitor, AGI-6780, the top two TCM compounds, precatorine and abrine, have higher binding affinities with target protein in docking simulation. After MD simulation, the top two TCM compounds remain as the same docking poses under dynamic conditions. In addition, precatorine is extracted from Abrus precatorius L., which represents the cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects for breast cancer and several tumor lines. Hence, we propose the TCM compounds, precatorine and abrine, as potential candidates as lead compounds for further study in drug development process with the IDH2 R140Q mutant protein against cancer.

The prognostic impact of ASXL1 mutation and expression levels was evaluated in the context of other clinical and molecular prognostic markers.;Mutations in ASXL1 occurred with a frequency of 20.7% in MDS (n = 40 of 193) with 70% (n = 28) of mutations being frameshift mutations and 30% (n = 12) being heterozygous point mutations leading to translational changes. ASXL1 mutations were correlated with an intermediate-risk karyotype (P = .002) but not with other clinical parameters. The presence of ASXL1 mutations was associated with a shorter overall survival for frameshift and point mutations combined (hazard ratio [HR], 1.744; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.82; P = .024) and for frameshift mutations only (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.50; P = .008).

DNA was available in 138 patients and mutation screening revealed 20 cases with JAK2, 6 with IDH, and 3 with MPL mutations; JAK2 and MPL mutations were seen mostly in MPN or \"MDS with isolated del(5q)\" whereas IDH mutations were frequent in other MDS variants. Overall median survival for the 143 patient cohort was 35 months and leukemic transformation (LT) was documented in 19 (~13%) cases. \"MDS with isolated del(5q)\" had the best prognosis with median survival of 66 months and LT rate of ~6%. Survival was poor among the other myeloid neoplasm subgroups regardless of specific morphologic diagnosis. Multivariable analysis identified higher leukocyte count and percentage of bone marrow and circulating blasts as independent predictors of shortened survival. The first two parameters and the presence of IDH mutations predicted inferior leukemia-free survival.

The presence of mutations in RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53, elevated SNP-A-based genomic complexity, and specific recurrent aCNAs predicted failure to achieve a complete response to induction chemotherapy. The presence of ≥1 aCNA/cnLOH and higher thresholds predicted for poor long-term survival irrespective of TP53 status, and the presence of ≥1 aCNA/cnLOH added negative prognostic information to knowledge of mutations in TET2, IDH1, NPM1, DNMT3A, and RUNX1. Results of multivariate analyses support a dominant role for TP53 mutations and a role for elevated genomic complexity as predictors of short survival in AML.;Integrated genomic profiling of a clinically relevant adult AML cohort identified genomic aberrations most associated with SNP-A-based genomic complexity, resistance to intensive induction therapies, and shortened overall survival.

Promoter CpG methylation is correlated with silencing of tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs) in specific pathways that are also targets of mutation or other mechanisms of inactivation, and is thought to contribute to disease progression and poor prognosis. Epigenetic contributions to myeloid pathogenesis are more complex. Examples include TSG inactivation and oncogenic activation associated with formation of altered chromatin separate from CpG methylation. Epigenetic dysregulation occurs at multiple disease stages and at non-CpG island genomic sites, and also includes genomic hypomethylation and small RNA mechanisms of epigenetic regulation. Identification of recurrent mutations in potential epigenetic regulators, including TET2, IDH1, IDH2, DNMT3A, UTX, and ASXL1, were recently described. Accordingly, therapeutics directed towards epigenetic mechanisms including methylation inhibitors and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have had some clinical success when applied to MDS and AML. However, identification of the underlying mechanisms associated with clinical responses and drug resistance remain enigmatic. Remarkably, in spite of significant molecular and translational progress, there are currently no epigenetic biomarkers in widespread clinical use.

The effects of mutations in IDH2 on cellular metabolism, the epigenetic state of mutated cells, and cellular differentiation have been elucidated in vitro and in vivo. Mutations in IDH2 lead to an enzymatic gain of function that catalyzes the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to beta-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG).

Whereas in other tumor entities the characteristics of tumor metabolism are successfully used for therapeutic approaches, such developments are very rare in brain tumors, notably in gliomas. One metabolic feature characteristic of gliomas, in particular diffuse astrocytomas and oligodendroglial tumors, is the variable content of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG), a metabolite that was discovered first in this tumor entity. D2HG is generated in large amounts due to various \"gain-of-function\" mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenases IDH1 and IDH2. Meanwhile, D2HG has been detected in several other tumor entities, including intrahepatic bile-duct cancer, chondrosarcoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. D2HG is barely detectable in healthy tissue (<0.1 mM), but its concentration increases up to 35 mM in malignant tumor tissues. Consequently, the \"oncometabolite\" D2HG has gained increasing interest in the field of tumor metabolism. To facilitate its quantitative measurement without loss of spatial resolution at a microscopical level, we have developed a novel bioluminescence assay for determining D2HG in sections of snap-frozen tissue. The assay was verified independently by photometric tests and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The novel technique allows the microscopically resolved determination of D2HG in a concentration range of 0-10 μmol/g tissue (wet weight). In combination with the already established bioluminescence imaging techniques for ATP, glucose, pyruvate, and lactate, the novel D2HG assay enables a comparative characterization of the metabolic profile of individual tumors in a further dimension.

MDSs are predominant in the elderly with an incidence of 20/100000 at 70 years of age. To date, the only curative treatment is allogeneic stem cell transplantation; however, a majority of patients are not eligible for this therapy. Azacitidine (AZA), a hypomethylating agent, remains the primary treatment for MDS patients, which leads to a significant increase in overall survival (OS), although it is not curative. Although it is well known that the impairment of apoptosis and differentiation are important features of this complex disease, the implication of autophagy in the pathogenesis of MDS is an emerging concept. Another significant advance in MDS pathogenesis research is the recent identification of mutations in genes encoding transcription factors implicated in hematopoiesis and proteins involved in splicing (SF3B1), methylation (DNMT3A), regulation of methylation (TET2 and IDH), DNA conformation (EZH2 and ASXL1) and differentiation (N- and K-RAS). Additionally, BCL2 family member expression and regulation may also affect the physiopathology of this disease. We have recently reported that targeting autophagy may be an interesting option for the treatment of AZA-resistant patients. Thus, targeting the products of the above-mentioned genes or the signaling pathways affected by the corresponding proteins may be of great interest for the development of a new arsenal of molecules to fight MDS.

        "Doc_abstract":"In acute myeloid leukaemia with normal karyotype (CN-AML), gene mutations (e.g. NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA) as well as deregulated gene expression affect outcome. High expression of ID1 was described as a negative prognostic factor. We have shown that CEBPA regulates ID1 expression. Therefore, we analysed the prognostic impact of ID1 expression in 269 patients (aged 16-60 years) with CN-AML in the context of other molecular markers, particularly CEBPA mutations. ID1(high) status was an independent negative prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in multivariate analysis when analysed together with age, extramedullary disease, platelets, expression of BAALC and WT1, FLT3-internal tandem duplication, NPM1, WT1 single nucleotide polymorphism rs16754 and IDH1. ID1 expression was higher in CEBPA wildtype patients than in patients with monoallelic CEBPA mutations and these patients showed higher ID1 expression compared to patients with biallelic CEBPA mutations. Thus, when CEBPA mutations were considered, ID1 expression lost its prognostic impact. Likewise, the negative impact of ID1(high) status on relapse-free survival (RFS) was lost when CEBPA mutations were included in the analysis. In CEBPA wildtype patients, ID1 expression had no impact on complete remission-rate, OS or RFS. In conclusion, CEBPA mutations seem to deregulate ID1 expression. Therefore, ID1 expression is not an independent prognostic factor in CN-AML.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes 1 and 2 are frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), low-grade glioma, cholangiocarcinoma (CC) and chondrosarcoma (CS). For AML, low-grade glioma and CC, mutant IDH status is associated with a DNA hypermethylation phenotype, implicating altered epigenome dynamics in the aetiology of these cancers. Here we show that the IDH variants in CS are also associated with a hypermethylation phenotype and display increased production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, supporting the role of mutant IDH-produced 2-hydroxyglutarate as an inhibitor of TET-mediated DNA demethylation. Meta-analysis of the acute myeloid leukaemia, low-grade glioma, cholangiocarcinoma and CS methylation data identifies cancer-specific effectors within the retinoic acid receptor activation pathway among the hypermethylated targets. By analysing sequence motifs surrounding hypermethylated sites across the four cancer types, and using chromatin immunoprecipitation and western blotting, we identify the transcription factor EBF1 (early B-cell factor 1) as an interaction partner for TET2, suggesting a sequence-specific mechanism for regulating DNA methylation.

Activating mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) metabolic enzymes leading to the abnormal accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutaric acid (2-HGA) have been described in hematologic malignancies and solid tumours. The diagnostic value of 2-HGA levels in blood to identify IDH mutations and its prognostic significance have been reported. We developed a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method allowing a rapid, accurate and precise simultaneous quantification of both L and D enantiomers of 2-HGA in blood samples from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients, suitable for clinical applications. The method was also develop for preclinical applications from cellular and tissues samples. Deuterated (R,S)-2-hydroxyglutaric acid, disodium salt was used as internal standard and added to samples before a solid phase extraction on Phenomenex STRATA™-XL-A (200mg-3mL) 33μm cartridges. A derivatization step with (+)- o,o'-diacetyl-l-tartaric anhydride permitted to separate the two resulting diastereoisomers without chiral stationary phase, on a C18 column combined to a Xevo TQ-MS Waters mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. This method allows standard curves to be linear over the range 0.34-135.04μM with r(2) values>0.999 and low matrix effects (<11.7%). This method, which was validated according to current EMA guidelines, is accurate between-run (<3.1%) and within-run (<7.9%) and precise between-run (<5.3CV%) and within-run (<6.2CV%), and is suitable for clinical and preclinical applications.
