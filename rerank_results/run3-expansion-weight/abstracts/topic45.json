        "Doc_abstract":"Genetic alteration is the driving force for thyroid tumorigenesis and progression, based upon which novel approaches to the management of thyroid cancer can be developed. A recent important genetic finding in thyroid cancer is the oncogenic T1799A transversion mutation of BRAF (the gene for the B-type Raf kinase, BRAF). Since the initial report of this mutation in thyroid cancer 2 years ago, rapid advancements have been made. BRAF mutation is the most common genetic alteration in thyroid cancer, occurring in about 45% of sporadic papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs), particularly in the relatively aggressive subtypes, such as the tall-cell PTC. This mutation is mutually exclusive with other common genetic alterations, supporting its independent oncogenic role, as demonstrated by transgenic mouse studies that showed BRAF mutation-initiated development of PTC and its transition to anaplastic thyroid cancer. BRAF mutation is mutually exclusive with RET/PTC rearrangement, and also displays a reciprocal age association with this common genetic alteration in thyroid cancer. The T1799A BRAF mutation occurs exclusively in PTC and PTC-derived anaplastic thyroid cancer and is a specific diagnostic marker for this cancer when identified in cytological and histological specimens. This mutation is associated with a poorer clinicopathological outcome and is a novel independent molecular prognostic marker in the risk evaluation of thyroid cancer. Moreover, preclinical and clinical evaluations of the therapeutic value of novel specific mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibitors in thyroid cancer are anticipated. This newly discovered BRAF mutation may prove to have an important impact on thyroid cancer in the clinic.",

Since among various genetic lesions identified in thyroid cancer, the BRAFV600E mutation is found in 50% of papillary thyroid cancers and 25% of anaplastic thyroid cancers, this mutation provides an opportunity for targeted drug therapy. Our laboratory evaluated cellular phenotypic effects in response to treatment with PLX4032, a BRAFV600E-specific inhibitor, in normal BRAF-wild-type thyroid cells and in BRAFV600E-positive papillary thyroid cancer cells.;Normal BRAF-wild-type thyroid cells and BRAFV600E-mutated papillary thyroid cancer cells were subjected to proliferation assays and analyzed for cell death by immunofluorescence. Cell cycle status was determined using an EdU uptake assay followed by laser scanning cytometry. In addition, expression of proteins within the MAPK signal transduction pathway was analyzed by Western blot.;PLX4032 has potent anti-proliferative effects selectively in BRAF-mutated thyroid cancer cells. These effects appear to be mediated by the drug's activity of inhibiting phosphorylation of signaling molecules downstream of BRAF within the pro-survival MAPK pathway. Interestingly, PLX4032 promotes the phosphorylation of these signaling molecules in BRAF-wild-type thyroid cells.;These findings support further evaluation of combinational therapy that includes BRAFV600E inhibitors in thyroid cancer patients harboring the BRAFV600E mutation.",

Because current therapeutic options for patients with thyroid cancers that are aggressive and/or do not respond to standard therapies are limited, BRAF and its downstream effectors represent attractive therapeutic targets.

BRAF is the only member of the RAF family activated by mutation in human cancers. A single amino acid substitution (V600E) accounts for a multitude of human cancers, which causes constitutive kinase activity. In papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and papillary-derived anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), the BRAF(V600E) mutation promotes follicular cell transformation. The BRAF(V600E)mutation could provide valuable prognostic information for thyroid cancer, because this mutation has been correlated with more aggressive and iodine-resistant phenotypes. Evidence has also shown that the detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in cancer is crucial in order to identify novel avenues for thyroid cancer treatment.Based on the BRAF kinase structure, novel drugs can potentially be designed to target oncogenic BRAF in cancer therapeutics. This review will focus on the recent progress in understandingthe functions of BRAF, the role of the BRAF mutations in thyroid carcinoma, and the correlation between BRAF mutations and cancer microenvironment.

However, the frequency of this mutation in several other types of thyroid neoplasms was not thoroughly investigated. In the present study, in addition to PTC, we evaluated various thyroid tumor types for the most common BRAF T1796A mutation by direct genomic DNA sequencing. We found a high and similar frequency (45%) of the BRAF T1796A mutation in two geographically distinct PTC patient populations: one composed of sporadic cases from North America, and the other from Kiev, Ukraine, that included individuals who were exposed to the Chernobyl nuclear accident. In contrast, we found BRAF mutation in only 20% of anaplastic thyroid cancers and no mutation in medullary thyroid cancers and benign thyroid hyperplasia. We also confirmed previous reports that the BRAF T1796A mutation did not occur in benign thyroid adenomas and follicular thyroid cancers. Specific analysis of the Ukraine patients with confirmed history of radiation exposure failed to show a higher incidence of BRAF mutation. Our results suggest that frequent occurrence of BRAF mutation is inherently associated with PTC, irrespective of geographic origin, and is apparently not a radiation-susceptible mutation. The lack or low prevalence of BRAF mutation in other thyroid neoplasms is consistent with the notion that other previously defined genetic alterations on the same signaling pathway are sufficient to cause tumorigenesis in most thyroid neoplasms.",

In thyroid carcinomas, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression was found increased in differentiated, poorly differentiated, medullary and anaplastic variants. Hypoxia represents the principal stimulus responsible for hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha induction. Other nonhypoxic stimuli increase hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha synthesis through the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in a cell-type-specific manner. We have previously shown the role of BRAF(V600E) mutation in papillary thyroid cancer cells as a factor that facilitates tumor cell growth and progression. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that BRAF(V600E) mutation influences hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma cells. We analyzed 27 papillary thyroid carcinomas, 13 of which presented BRAF(V600E) mutation. In tumor tissues, immunoreactivity for hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha was detected in the majority of analyzed BRAF(V600E) mutated cases. Transcriptional analyses revealed elevated hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha levels with significant differences between wild-type and mutated group. A BRAF wild-type papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line and a BRAF(V600E) mutated papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line were selected to study the effects of BRAF mutation on hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression in vitro. Knockdown of mutant BRAF(V600E) or both the wild type and the BRAF(V600E) by RNA interference induced a significant reduction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression at mRNA and protein levels. Pharmacological inhibition of BRAF significantly reduces hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha expression levels in papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line harboring BRAF(V600E) mutation. Our results suggest that hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha is expressed in papillary thyroid carcinomas and is regulated not only by hypoxia but also by BRAF(V600E)-mediated signaling pathway.",

Ultrasonography (US) and US-guided biopsy remain cornerstones in the initial workup of thyroid cancer. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment, with radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy reserved for differentiated subtypes. Posttreatment surveillance of thyroid cancer is done with US of the thyroid bed as well as monitoring of tumor markers such as serum thyroglobulin and serum calcitonin. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT are used in the follow-up of patients with negative iodine 131 imaging and elevated tumor markers. Certain mutations, such as mutations of BRAF in papillary thyroid carcinoma and mutations in RET codons 883, 918, and 928, are associated with an aggressive course in medullary thyroid carcinoma, and affected patients need close surveillance. Treatment options for metastatic RAI-refractory thyroid cancer are limited. Currently, Food and Drug Administration-approved molecularly targeted therapies for metastatic RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, including sorafenib, lenvatinib, vandetanib, and cabozantinib, target the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and RET kinases. Imaging plays an important role in assessment of response to these therapies, which can be atypical owing to antiangiogenic effects. A wide spectrum of toxic effects is associated with the molecularly targeted therapies used in thyroid cancer and can be detected at restaging scans. (©)RSNA, 2016. ",

Unlike its high treatment response to selective BRAF inhibitor (PLX4032) in metastatic melanoma, the treatment response in thyroid cancer is reported to be low. The purpose of this study is to investigate the resistance mechanism responsible for this low treatment response to BRAF inhibitor in order to maximize the effect of targeted therapy. We examined the expression of feedback regulation mechanisms and alterations in the upper signal transduction pathway in thyroid cancer cell lines harboring BRAF mutation. Also, we investigated the effect of dual inhibition from combinatorial therapy. Two thyroid cancer cell lines, 8505C (anaplastic thyroid cancer) and BCPAP (papillary thyroid cancer) were selected and treated with PLX4032 and its drug sensitivity were examined and compared. Further investigation on the changes in signals responsible for the different treatment response to PLX4032 was carried out and the same experiment was performed on orthotopic xenograft mouse models. Unlike BCPAP cells, 8505C cells presented drug resistance to PLX4032 treatment and this was mainly due to increased expression of c-Met. Effective inhibitions of c-Met, p-AKT, and p-ERK were achieved after dual treatment with BRAF inhibitor (PLX4032) and c-Met inhibitor (PHA665752). Similar results were confirmed by in vivo study with orthotopic xenograft mouse model. c-Met-mediated reactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and MAPK pathway contributes to the relative insensitivity of BRAF (V600E) mutant anaplastic thyroid cancer cells to PLX4032.

Complete total thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for PTC, FTC, and MTC. Radioiodine is routinely recommended in high-risk patients and considered in intermediate risk DTC patients. DTC cancer cells, during tumor progression, may lose the iodide uptake ability, becoming resistant to radioiodine, with a significant worsening of the prognosis. The lack of specific and effective drugs for aggressive and metastatic DTC and MTC leads to additional efforts toward the development of new drugs. Several genetic alterations in different molecular pathways in TC have been shown in the past few decades, associated with TC development and progression. Rearranged during transfection (RET)/PTC gene rearrangements, RET mutations, BRAF mutations, RAS mutations, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 angiogenesis pathways are some of the known pathways determinant in the development of TC. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are small organic compounds inhibiting tyrosine kinases auto-phosphorylation and activation, most of them are multikinase inhibitors. TKIs act on the aforementioned molecular pathways involved in growth, angiogenesis, local, and distant spread of TC. TKIs are emerging as new therapies of aggressive TC, including DTC, MTC, and anaplastic thyroid cancer, being capable of inducing clinical responses and stabilization of disease. Vandetanib and cabozantinib have been approved for the treatment of MTC, while sorafenib and lenvatinib for DTC refractory to radioiodine.

In patients with papillary thyroid cancer we compared clinicopathological characteristics between those harboring BRAF mutation and those without it. Twenty five consecutive patients operated for benign nodules and for papillary carcinoma were prospectively included. Fresh tissue samples of thyroid nodules and of adjacent thyroid parenchyma were obtained. DNA was extracted and amplified by amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS PCR). Direct sequencing was performed in four samples. Of those patients operated for papillary thyroid cancer, 77% harbored BRAF mutation. All samples from adjacent thyroid parenchyma and from patients operated for benign nodules tested negative for the mutation. Direct sequencing confirmed the results obtained by ARMS PCR. Patients with BRAF mutation were significantly older at the time of diagnosis (BRAF+ 47.7 ± 12.7 years vs. BRAF- 24.7 ± 8.1 years, p < 0.01). Nine out of ten papillary carcinomas with BRAF mutation corresponded to the classic histological subtype, which was not observed in BRAF negative tumors (p < 0.02). In conclusion, we found a high frequency of BRAF V600E mutation in this population of patients operated for papillary thyroid carcinoma in Argentina. These results are consistent with those reported in the literature. ",

External beam radiation therapy is reserved for adjuvant treatment of MTC with aggressive features. Targeted therapeutics vandetanib and cabozantinib are approved for the treatment of aggressive and metastatic tumors that are not amenable to surgery. The use of these multikinase inhibitors are supported by the observed overactivation of the RET oncoprotein in a large subpopulation of MTCs. However, not all patients carry oncogenic alterations of this kinase. Hence, there is still a need for comprehensive molecular characterization of MTC utilizing whole-genome and transcriptome-sequencing methodologies with the aim of identifying targetable mutations. Here, we describe the genomic profiles of two medullary thyroid cancers and report the presence of a putative oncogenic BRAF fusion in one. Such alterations, previously observed in other malignancies and known targets of available drugs, can benefit patients who currently have no treatment options. ",

Mice with thyroid-specific expression of Braf(V600E) (TPO-Braf(V600E)) develop PTC rapidly with high levels of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). It is unclear to what extent the elevated TSH contributes to tumor progression. To investigate the progression of Braf(V600E)-induced PTC (BVE-PTC) under normal TSH, we transplanted BVE-PTC tumors subcutaneously into nude and TPO-Braf(WT) mice. Regression of the transplanted tumors was observed in both nude and TPO-Braf(WT) mice. They were surrounded by heavy lymphocyte infiltration and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) was demonstrated by strong β-gal staining and absence of Ki-67 expression. In contrast, BVE-PTC transplants continued to grow when transplanted into TPO-Braf(V600E) mice. The expression of Trp53 was increased in tumor transplants undergoing OIS. Trp53 inactivation reversed OIS and enabled tumor transplants to grow in nude mice with characteristic cell morphology of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). PTC-to-ATC transformation was also observed in primary BVE-PTC tumors. ATC cells derived from Trp53 knockout tumors had increased PI3K/AKT signaling and became resistant to Braf(V600E) inhibitor PLX4720, which could be overcome by combined treatment of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and PLX4720. In conclusion, BVE-PTC progression could be contained via p53-dependent OIS and TSH is a major disruptor of this balance. Simultaneous targeting of both MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways offer a better therapeutic outcome against ATC. The current study reinforces the importance of rigorous control of serum TSH in PTC patients.

Tissue blocks from 76 patients with diagnostic features of papillary thyroid carcinomas (40 with conventional type and 36 with follicular variant) were included in the study. From these, DNA was extracted and BRAF V600E mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing of exon 15. Analysis of the data indicated that BRAF V600E mutation is significantly more common in conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma (58% versus 31%, P = .022). Furthermore, the mutation was often noted in female patients (P = .017), in high-stage cancers (P = .034), and in tumors with mild lymphocytic thyroiditis (P = .006).

This article provides a comprehensive review of this exciting new thyroid cancer field. The oncogenic role of TERT promoter mutations involves their creation of consensus binding sites for E-twenty-six transcriptional factors. TERT C228T is far more common than TERT C250T and their collective prevalence is, on average, 0, 11.3, 17.1, 43.2 and 40.1% in benign thyroid tumors, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), follicular thyroid cancer, poorly differentiated thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer, respectively, displaying an association with aggressive types of thyroid cancer. TERT promoter mutations are associated with aggressive thyroid tumor characteristics, tumor recurrence and patient mortality as well as BRAF V600E mutation. Coexisting BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations have a robust synergistic impact on the aggressiveness of PTC, including a sharply increased tumor recurrence and patient mortality, while either mutation alone has a modest impact. Thus, TERT with promoter mutations represents a prominent new oncogene in thyroid cancer and the mutations are promising new diagnostic and prognostic genetic markers for thyroid cancer, which, in combination with BRAF V600E mutation or other genetic markers (e.g. RAS mutations), are proving to be clinically useful for the management of thyroid cancer. Future studies will specifically define such clinical utilities, elucidate the biological mechanisms and explore the potential as therapeutic targets of TERT promoter mutations in thyroid cancer. ",

Among the mutations commonly seen in thyroid cancers, the vast majority are associated with the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) mutations are the most common mutations observed in papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs), followed by RET/PTC rearrangements and RAS mutations, while follicular thyroid cancers are more likely to harbor RAS mutations or PAX8/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) rearrangements. Beyond these more common mutations, alterations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter have recently been associated with clinicopathologic features, disease prognosis, and tumorigenesis in thyroid cancer. While the mutations underlying thyroid tumorigenesis are well known, the frequency of these mutations is strongly associated with geography, with clear differences reported between Asian and Western countries. Of particular interest is the prevalence of BRAF mutations, with Korean patients exhibiting the highest rate of BRAF-associated thyroid cancers in the world.

However, coexistence of these genetic alterations was increasingly seen with progression from differentiated tumor to undifferentiated ATC. Their coexistence with BRAF mutation was also frequent in PTC and ATC.;The data provide strong genetic implication that aberrant activation of PI3K/Akt pathway plays an extensive role in thyroid tumorigenesis, particularly in FTC and ATC, and promotes progression of BTA to FTC and to ATC as the genetic alterations of this pathway accumulate.

Trametinib inhibited the cellular viability to variable degrees in every cell by downregulating ERK phosphorylation. Dual blockade by both inhibitors demonstrated clear cytostatic effect in all the cells.

These in vitro cell lines originate from differentiated and dedifferentiated in vivo human thyroid tumors. However, it has been shown that mRNA expression profiles of these cell lines were closer to dedifferentiated in vivo thyroid tumors (anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, ATC) than to differentiated ones. Here an overview of the knowledge of these models was made. The mutational status of six human thyroid cancer cell lines (WRO, FTC133, BCPAP, TPC1, K1, and 8505C) was in line with previously reported findings for 10 genes frequently mutated in thyroid cancer. However, the presence of a BRAF mutation (T1799A: V600E) in WRO questions the use of this cell line as a model for follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). Next, to investigate the biological meaning of the modulated mRNAs in these cells, a pathway analysis on previously obtained mRNA profiles was performed on five cell lines. In five cell lines, the MHC class II pathway was down-regulated and in four of them, ribosome biosynthesis and translation pathways were up-regulated. mRNA expression profiles of the cell lines were also compared to those of the different types of thyroid cancers. Three datasets originating from different microarray platforms and derived from distinct laboratories were used. This meta-analysis showed a significant higher correlation between the profiles of the thyroid cancer cell lines and ATC, than to differentiated thyroid tumors (i.e., PTC or FTC) specifically for DNA replication. This already observed higher correlation was obtained here with an increased number of in vivo tumors and using different platforms. In summary, this would suggest that some papillary thyroid carcinoma or follicular thyroid carcinoma (PTC or FTC) cell lines (i.e., TPC-1) might have partially lost their original DNA synthesis/replication regulation mechanisms during their in vitro cell adaptation/evolution.",

Immunohistochemistry was performed on orthotopic primary human ATC and metastatic ATC in lung tissue to compare TSP-1 and integrin protein expression levels.;TSP-1 knock-down down-regulates ITGα3, α6, and β1 in BRAF(V600E)-human ATC cells. BRAF(V600E)-ATC cells with TSP-1 knock-down were rounded compared to control cells, which displayed a spread morphology. TSP-1 knock-down also reduced TSP-1, ITGα3, α6, and β1 protein expression levels in vivo in the ATC microenvironment, which is enriched in stromal and inflammatory cells.;TSP-1 silencing causes changes in ITG levels and ATC cell morphology. The assessment of TSP-1 and ITG levels might contribute to earlier metastatic potential of BRAF(V600E)-positive aggressive thyroid cancers, and allow improved patient selection for clinical trials.",

TERT promoter mutations were seen more frequently in advanced cancers with BRAF/RAS mutations compared to those that were BRAF/RAS wild-type (ATC + PDTC, 67.3 vs 24.1%; P < 10(-4)), whereas BRAF-mutant PTCs were less likely to have TERT promoter mutations than BRAF wild-type tumors (11.8 vs 50.0%; P = .04).;TERT promoter mutations are highly prevalent in advanced thyroid cancers, particularly those harboring BRAF or RAS mutations, whereas PTCs with BRAF or RAS mutations are most often TERT promoter wild type.

Similarly, there is increasing evidence demonstrating that mutations leading to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K)/AKT effectors -PTEN and PI3KCa- are essential for the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). Besides this strong relationship between the histological phenotype and the pathway predominantly activated, the nature of the genetic event seems to determine the biological behaviour of the tumour and the ultimate clinical outcome of the patient. In this review we will summarise and discuss the main genetic events related to thyroid cancer initiation, the contribution of genomics and the convenience of using a new molecular classification of thyroid cancer, complementary to the clinicopathological classification.

For papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), the most characteristic gene expression profile is associated with the presence of BRAF mutation. BRAF-associated PTC differ profoundly from RET/PTC or RAS-associated cancers. Simultaneously, they retain many characteristic gene expression features common for all PTCs, induced by the alternative mutations activating MAPK pathway. Although the difference between papillary and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) is significant at the gene expression profile level, surprisingly, the RAS-related signature of FTC is not well specified. PAX8/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) rearrangements, which occur in FTC as an alternative to the RAS mutation, are associated with specific changes in gene expression. Furthermore, the difference between well-differentiated thyroid cancers and poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid cancers is mainly a reflection of tumor degree of differentiation and may not be attributed to the presence of characteristic mutations.",

Anti-cancer therapy induced autophagy can trigger adaptive drug resistance in a variety of cancer types and treatments. To date, role of autophagy during BRAF inhibition in thyroid cancer remains unknown.;In this study, we investigate if autophagy is activated in vemurafenib treated BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells, and whether autophagy inhibition improves or impairs the treatment efficacy of vemurafenib.;Autophagy level was determined by western blot assay and transmission electron microscopy. The combined effects of autophagy inhibitor and vemurafenib were assessed in terms of cell viability in vitro and tumor growth rate in vivo. Whether the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was in response to vemurafenib-induced autophagy was also analyzed.;Vemurafenib induced a high level of autophagy in BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cells. Inhibition of autophagy by either a pharmacological inhibitor or interfering RNA knockdown of essential autophagy genes augmented vemurafenib-induced cell death. Vemurafenib-induced autophagy was independent of MAPK signaling pathway and was mediated through the ER stress response. Finally, administration of vemurafenib with the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine promoted more pronounced tumor suppression in vivo.;Our data demonstrate that vemurafenib induces ER stress response-mediated autophagy in thyroid cancer and autophagy inhibition may be a beneficial strategy to sensitize BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer to vemurafenib.",

Results were analyzed in the context of The Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA study) of papillary thyroid cancers (PTC).;Compared to PDTCs, ATCs had a greater mutation burden, including a higher frequency of mutations in TP53, TERT promoter, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway effectors, SWI/SNF subunits, and histone methyltransferases. BRAF and RAS were the predominant drivers and dictated distinct tropism for nodal versus distant metastases in PDTC. RAS and BRAF sharply distinguished between PDTCs defined by the Turin (PDTC-Turin) versus MSKCC (PDTC-MSK) criteria, respectively. Mutations of EIF1AX, a component of the translational preinitiation complex, were markedly enriched in PDTCs and ATCs and had a striking pattern of co-occurrence with RAS mutations. While TERT promoter mutations were rare and subclonal in PTCs, they were clonal and highly prevalent in advanced cancers. Application of the TCGA-derived BRAF-RAS score (a measure of MAPK transcriptional output) revealed a preserved relationship with BRAF/RAS mutation in PDTCs, whereas ATCs were BRAF-like irrespective of driver mutation.;These data support a model of tumorigenesis whereby PDTCs and ATCs arise from well-differentiated tumors through the accumulation of key additional genetic abnormalities, many of which have prognostic and possible therapeutic relevance.

As the drivers of this process, many genetic alterations activating the PI3K/Akt pathway have been identified in thyroid cancer in recent years.;This review summarizes the current knowledge on major genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway. These include PIK3CA mutations and genomic amplification/copy gain, Ras mutations, PTEN mutations, RET/PTC and PPARgamma/Pax8 rearrangements, as well as amplification/copy gain of PIK3CB, PDK1, Akt, and various receptor tyrosine kinase genes. Most of these genetic alterations are particularly common in FTC and many of them are even more common in ATC; they are generally less common in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), in which the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway activated by the BRAF mutation instead plays a major role. Methylation and, thus, epigenetic silencing of PTEN, a major negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway, occurs in close association with activating genetic alterations of the PI3K/Akt pathway, constituting a unique self-enhancement mechanism for this pathway. Many of these genetic alterations are mutually exclusive in differentiated thyroid tumors, but with increasing concurrence from benign tumors to FTC to ATC. RET/PTC, Ras, and receptor tyrosine kinase could dually activate the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways. Most cases of ATC harbor genetic alterations in these genes or other genetic combinations that can activate both pathways. It is proposed that genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway promote thyroid cell transformation to FTC and that genetic alterations in the MAPK pathway promote cell transformation to PTC; accumulation of multiple genetic alterations that can activate both pathways promotes thyroid cancer aggressiveness and progression to ATC.;Genetic alterations are common in the PI3K/Akt pathway in thyroid cancer and play a fundamental role in the tumorigenesis and progression of this cancer.

Levels of protein expression were analysed by western-blot.;Both BRAF RNAi and sorafenib inhibited proliferation in all the cell lines independently of the genetic background, mostly in cells with BRAF(V600E) mutation. In BRAF(V600E) mutated cells inhibition of BRAF pathway lead to a decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cyclin D1 levels and an increase in p27(Kip1). Specific inhibition of BRAF by RNAi in cells with BRAF(V600E) mutation had no effect on apoptosis. In the case of sorafenib treatment, cells harbouring BRAF(V600E) mutation showed increase levels of apoptosis due to a balance of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2.;Our results in thyroid cancer cells, namely those harbouring BRAF(V600E) mutation showed that BRAF signalling pathway provides important proliferation signals. We have shown that in thyroid cancer cells sorafenib induces apoptosis by affecting Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in BRAF(V600E) mutated cells which was independent of BRAF. These results suggest that sorafenib may prove useful in the treatment of thyroid carcinomas, particularly those refractory to conventional treatment and harbouring BRAF mutations.",

As a novel prognostic molecular marker, this mutation has received considerable attention in recent years for its potential utility in the risk stratification and management of PTC. In PTC, BRAF mutation is closely associated with extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis, advanced tumor stages, disease recurrence, and even patient mortality. Many of the responsible molecular derangements promoted by, or associated with, BRAF mutation have been identified, including over-expression of tumor-promoting genes, suppression of tumor-suppressor genes, and silencing of thyroid iodide-handling genes, resulting in impairment or loss of radioiodine avidity and hence the failure of radioiodine treatment of PTC. BRAF mutation can be readily tested on thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy specimens, with high preoperative predictive probabilities for clinicopathological outcomes of PTC. As such, the knowledge of BRAF mutation status can facilitate more accurate risk stratification and better decision making at various steps in the management of PTC, from preoperative planning of initial surgical scale to postoperative decisions about appropriate radioiodine treatment and thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression, and to selections of appropriate surveillance modalities for PTC recurrence. The greatest utility of BRAF mutation status is in those cases where traditional clinicopathological criteria alone would otherwise be unreliable in the risk stratification and management of PTC. Use of this unique molecular marker, in conjunction with conventional clinicopathological risk factors, to assist the prognostication of PTC is likely to improve the efficiency of contemporary management of thyroid cancer.",

The results show that BRAF(V600E) mutation rate was found in 39.45% of our patients. We observed that BRAF(V600E) mutation was significantly higher in men, in tumors larger than 1 cm in size, and in patients with classical PTC.

In SW1736 drugs had no effect on migration in 2D but decreased invasion in 3D, however this related to reduced growth. Dual inhibition of BRAF(V600E) and MEK reduced but did not prevent SW1736 invasion although rebound phosphorylation of ERK in response to PLX4720 was blocked by U0126. These findings indicate that anti-tumor drug effects in vitro differ depending on culture conditions (2D vs. 3D) and that the invasive features of anaplastic thyroid cancer depend on non-MEK mechanism(s).",

In childhood papillary thyroid cancer, regardless of history of radiation exposure, RET/PTC rearrangements are a major event. Conversely, in adult-onset papillary thyroid cancer among the general population, the most common molecular event is BRAF(V600E) point mutation, not RET/PTC rearrangements. To clarify which gene alteration, chromosome aberration, or point mutation preferentially occurs in radiation-associated adult-onset papillary thyroid cancer, we have performed molecular analyses on RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF(V600E) mutation in 71 papillary thyroid cancer cases among atomic bomb survivors (including 21 cases not exposed to atomic bomb radiation), in relation to radiation dose as well as time elapsed since atomic bomb radiation exposure. RET/PTC rearrangements showed significantly increased frequency with increased radiation dose (P(trend) = 0.002). In contrast, BRAF(V600E) mutation was less frequent in cases exposed to higher radiation dose (P(trend) < 0.001). Papillary thyroid cancer subjects harboring RET/PTC rearrangements developed this cancer earlier than did cases with BRAF(V600E) mutation (P = 0.03). These findings were confirmed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. These results suggest that RET/PTC rearrangements play an important role in radiation-associated thyroid carcinogenesis.",

Previous studies detected ret/PTC rearrangements more frequently in PTC from children than adults, and recent reports describe a high incidence of BRAF T1796A transversion in adult PTC. However, BRAF mutations have not been adequately studied in PTC from young patients. We amplified and sequenced segments of the BRAF gene spanning the T1796A transversion site in 14 PTC from patients 10-21 years of age (mean, 17.5 +/- 3.5 years). The PTC (7 = class 1; 5 = class 2; 1 = class 3) ranged from 0.7-2.9 cm in diameter (mean, 1.4 +/- 0.75 cm). None of them (0/14) contained BRAF T1796A and none recurred (mean follow-up, 66 +/- 40 months). This incidence of BRAF T1796A is significantly less than that reported for adult PTC (270/699, 38.6%, p = 0.0015) in several series. None of our PTC (0/10) contained ras mutations, but 7/12 (58%) contained ret/PTC rearrangements.

Inhibition of either oncogenic BRAF or SRC has marked anti-tumor effects in mouse models of thyroid cancer, however, neither drug induces notable apoptosis. Here we report that the SRC-inhibitor dasatinib further sensitizes BRAFV600E-positive thyroid cancer cells to the BRAFV600E-inhibitor PLX4720. Combined treatment with PLX4720 and dasatinib synergistically inhibited proliferation and reduced migration in PTC and ATC cells. Whereas PLX4720 did not induce robust apoptosis in thyroid cancer cells, combined treatment with dasatinib induced apoptosis in 4 of 6 lines. In an immunocompetent orthotopic mouse model of ATC, combined PLX4720 and dasatinib treatment significantly reduced tumor volume relative to PLX4720 treatment alone. Immune cell infiltration was increased by PLX4720 treatment and this effect was maintained in mice treated with both PLX4720 and dasatinib. Further, combined treatment significantly increased caspase 3 cleavage in vivo relative to control or either treatment alone. In conclusion, combined PLX4720 and dasatinib treatment induces apoptosis, increases immune cell infiltration and reduces tumor volume in a preclinical model of ATC, suggesting that the combination of these FDA-approved drugs may have potential for the treatment of patients with ATC or refractory PTC.

Possible association between praja2 mRNA and the presence of known mutations was evaluated.;We found a statistical significant increase of mRNA levels in PTC tissue samples, compared with benign nodules and ATC. In particular, mRNA levels were maximal in differentiated thyroid cancer (PTC), progressively decreasing in more aggressive tumors, ATC having the lowest amount of praja2 mRNA. Accordingly, higher levels of praja2 protein were detected in lysates from PTC, compared with ATC. By immunohistochemistry, in PTC sections we observed a marked increase of cytoplasmic praja2 signal, which significantly decreased in less differentiated thyroid tumors, completely disappearing in ATC. Studies in cultured cells stably expressing RET/PTC1 oncogene or mutant BRAF revealed a direct correlation between praja2 mRNA levels and malignant phenotype of transformed cells. Similar results were obtained using thyroid cancer tissues carrying the same mutations.;praja2 is markedly overexpressed in differentiated thyroid cancer, and its levels inversely correlate with the malignant phenotype of the tumor.

VEGF expression levels were strongly positively correlated to tumor size (P < 0.001), extrathyroidal invasion (P = 0.02), and tumor stage (P = 0.04). Multivariate analysis clearly showed that VEGF expression was up-regulated in BRAF V600E(+) PTC (odds ratio 2.5, confidence interval 1.1-5.6; P = 0.03).;BRAF V600E(+) PTC tended to have larger tumor volumes and higher expression of VEGF. The level of VEGF expression was closely correlated with tumor size, extrathyroidal invasion, and stage. The relatively high levels of VEGF expression may be related to poorer clinical outcomes and recurrences in BRAF V600E(+) PTC.",

We retrospectively analyzed the 2-year medical records of patients who underwent surgery for papillary thyroid carcinoma. After screening, the records of 126 patients who met the study requirements were used to assess the characteristics associated with the BRAF V600E gene mutation. The BRAF mutation incidence rate among patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma was 69.0% (87/126). Univariate analysis revealed that the BRAF mutation status was correlated significantly with both tumor size and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed a significant correlation between lymph node metastasis and BRAF mutation status (P < 0.05). When the tumor diameter was ≤10 mm, the BRAF mutation status had no effect on lymph node metastasis (P > 0.05). When the tumor diameter was >10 mm, the incidence of lymph node metastasis was significantly higher among BRAF mutation-positive patients than among BRAF mutation-negative patients (P < 0.05). BRAF gene mutations independently predicted central lymph node metastasis in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma. For patients preoperatively diagnosed to be BRAF mutation-positive, the importance of central lymph node dissection should be emphasized because the tumor diameter increases; regional lymphatic and adipose tissue dissection should be routinely conducted. However, in mutation-negative patients with tumor diameters of ≤5 mm, the need for central lymph node dissection should be re-examined. ",

Activated AMPK inhibits the protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin, thereby reducing the extent of protein translation and suppressing both cell growth and cell cycle entry. Recent reports indicate that AMPK-mediated growth inhibition is achieved via an action of the RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in melanoma cells harboring the V600E mutant form of the BRAF oncogene. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer efficacy of AICAR by measuring its effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression of BRAF wild-type and V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines. We also explored the mechanism underlying these effects. AICAR inhibited the proliferation of BRAF V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines more strongly than was the case with wild-type cell lines. The suppressive effect of AICAR on cell proliferation was associated with increased S-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, AICAR suppressed phosphorylation of ERK and p70S6K in BRAF V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cells, but rather increased phosphorylation in wild-type cells. Together, the results indicate that AICAR-induced AMPK activation in BRAF V600E-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines resulted in increases in apoptosis and S-phase arrest via downregulation of ERK and p70S6K activity. Thus, regulation of AMPK activity may be potentially useful as a therapy for thyroid cancer if the cancer harbors a BRAF V600E mutation.",

Mutations of Ras, PIK3Ca, PTEN, and BRAF genes and RET/PTC rearrangements were common, whereas mutations in PDK1, Akt1, Akt2, and RTK genes were uncommon in ATC. Overall, 46 of 48 ATC (95.8%) harbored at least one genetic alteration, and coexistence of two or more was seen in 37 of 48 ATC (77.1%). These genetic alterations were somewhat less common in FTC. Genetic alterations that could activate both the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways were found in 39 of 48 ATC (81.3%). RTK gene copy gains were preferentially associated with p-Akt, suggesting their dominant role in activating the PI3K/Akt pathway. The phosphorylation of Akt was far more common than p-ERK in FTC, and both were relatively common and often coexisted in ATC.;Genetic alterations in the RTKs and PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways are extremely prevalent in ATC and FTC, providing a strong genetic basis for an extensive role of these signaling pathways and the development of therapies targeting these pathways for ATC and FTC, particularly the former.",

In this study, we hypothesized that histone deacetylation at the NIS (SLC5A5) promoter was the mechanism. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation approach, we examined histone acetylation status on the lysine residues H3K9/14, H3K18, total H4, and H4K16 at the NIS promoter under the influence of BRAF V600E. We found that expression of stably or transiently transfected BRAF V600E inhibited NIS expression while the deacetylase inhibitor SAHA stimulated NIS expression in PCCL3 rat thyroid cells. Although BRAF V600E enhanced global histone acetylation, it caused histone deacetylation at the NIS promoter while SAHA caused acetylation in the cells. In human thyroid cancer BCPAP cells harboring homozygous BRAF V600E mutation, BRAF V600E inhibitor, PLX4032, and MEK inhibitor, AZD6244, increased histone acetylation of the NIS promoter, suggesting that BRAF V600E normally maintained histone in a deacetylated state at the NIS promoter. The regions most commonly affected with deacetylation by BRAF V600E were the transcriptionally active areas upstream of the translation start that contained important transcription factor binding sites, including nucleotides -297/-107 in the rat NIS promoter and -692/-370 in the human NIS promoter. Our findings not only reveal an epigenetic mechanism for BRAF V600E-promoted NIS silencing involving histone deacetylation at critical regulatory regions of the NIS promoter but also provide further support for our previously proposed combination therapy targeting major signaling pathways and histone deacetylase to restore thyroid gene expression for radioiodine treatment of thyroid cancer.

Thyroid tissue blocks from 42 consecutive pediatric WDTC patients who underwent thyroidectomy between 2001 and 2013 were analyzed at Quest Diagnostics for BRAF(V600E), RAS mutations (N,K,H), and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARγ rearrangements, using validated molecular methods. Thyroid carcinomas included PTC, follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), and follicular variant of PTC (FVPTC).;Thirty-nine samples (29 females) were genotyped.

Recently, we showed that, similar to human thyroid cancer, the PI3K-AKT pathway is overactivated in both the thyroid and metastatic lesions of a mouse model of follicular thyroid carcinoma (TRbeta(PV/PV) mice). This TRbeta(PV/PV) mouse harbors a knockin mutant thyroid hormone receptor beta gene (TRbetaPV mutant) that spontaneously develops thyroid cancer and distant metastasis similar to human follicular thyroid cancer. That the activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling contributes to thyroid carcinogenesis raised the possibility that this pathway could be a potential therapeutic target in follicular thyroid carcinoma. The present study tested this possibility by treating TRbeta(PV/PV) mice with LY294002 (LY), a potent and specific PI3K inhibitor, and evaluating the effect of LY on the spontaneous development of thyroid cancer. LY treatment inhibited the AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-p70(S6K) signaling, and it decreased cyclin D1 and increased p27(Kip1) expression to inhibit thyroid tumor growth and reduce tumor cell proliferation. LY treatment increased caspase 3 and decreased phosphorylated-BAD to induce apoptosis. In addition, LY treatment reduced the AKT-matrix metalloproteinase 2 signaling to decrease cell motility to block metastatic spread of thyroid tumors. Thus, these altered signaling pathways converged effectively to prolong survival of TRbeta(PV/PV) mice treated with LY. No significant adverse effects were observed for wild-type mice treated similarly with LY. The present study provides the first preclinical evidence for the in vivo efficacy for LY in the treatment of follicular thyroid cancer.",

Upon the onset of puberty, the incidence of thyroid cancer increases in females only and declines again after menopause. Estrogen is a potent growth factor both for benign and malignant thyroid cells that may explain the sex difference in the prevalence of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. It exerts its growth-promoting effect through a classical genomic and a non-genomic pathway, mediated via a membrane-bound estrogen receptor. This receptor is linked to the tyrosine kinase signaling pathways MAPK and PI3K. In papillary thyroid carcinomas, these pathways may be activated either by a chromosomal rearrangement of the tyrosine receptor kinase TRKA, by RET/PTC genes, or by a BRAF mutation and, in addition, in females they may be stimulated by high levels of estrogen. Furthermore, estrogen is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and metastasis that are critical for the outcome of thyroid cancer.

Armed with data that correlate biomarker activity with disease presence and progression, clinicians can develop treatment strategies that address risks of disease recurrence or persistence and progression. The B-type Raf kinase (BRAF V600E) mutation in exon 15 of the BRAF gene has been noted to be a putative prognostic marker of the most prevalent form of thyroid cancer, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC)--a tumor type with high proclivity for recurrence or persistence. There has been a remarkable interest in determining the association of BRAF mutation with PTC recurrence or persistence. Using many new studies that have been published recently, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate correlations of BRAF mutation status with PTC prognosis, focusing on the recurrence or persistence of the disease after initial treatment. The study was based on published studies included in the PubMed and Embase databases addressing the BRAF mutation and the frequency of recurrence of PTC. We selected studies with data that enabled measurement of the risk ratio for recurrent disease. We also analyzed the factors that are classically known to be associated with recurrence. These factors included lymph node metastasis, extrathyroidal extension, distant metastasis, and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stages III/IV. We used 14 articles that included an analysis of these factors as well as PTC recurrence data, with a total of 2470 patients from 9 different countries. The overall prevalence of the BRAF mutation was 45%. The risk ratios in BRAF mutation-positive patients were 1.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.61-2.32; Z = 7.01; p < 0.00001) for PTC recurrence, 1.32 (95% CI, 1.20-1.45; Z = 5.73; p < 0.00001) for lymph node metastasis, 1.71 (95% CI, 1.50-1.94; Z = 8.09; p < 0.00001) for extrathyroidal extension, 0.95 (95% CI, 0.63-1.44; Z = 0.23; p = 0.82) for distant metastasis, and 1.70 (95% CI, 1.45-1.99; Z = 6.46; p < 0.00001) for advanced stage AJCC III/IV. Thus, in this meta-analysis, the BRAF mutation in PTC was significantly associated with PTC recurrence, lymph node metastasis, extrathyroidal extension, and advanced stage AJCC III/IV. Patients with PTC harboring mutated BRAF are likely to demonstrate factors that are associated with an increased risk for recurrence of the disease, offering new prospects for optimizing and tailoring initial treatment strategies to prevent recurrence.",

However, those statistically significant relationships were not found in the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas.;The BRAF(V600E) mutation might be associated with a more aggressive phenotype and a poor prognosis, causing less NIS-mediated 131I uptake due to a lower functional NIS protein expression in the classic variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cancer gender disparity in incidence, disease aggressiveness and prognosis has been observed in a variety of cancers. Thyroid cancer is one of the fastest growing cancer diagnoses worldwide. It is 2.9-times more common in women than men. The less aggressive histologic subtypes of thyroid cancer are more common in women, whereas the more aggressive histologic subtypes have similar gender distribution. The gender disparity in incidence, aggressiveness and prognosis is well established for thyroid cancer but the cause of the disparity is poorly understood. The aim of this article is to evaluate the current evidence on the cause of thyroid cancer gender disparity. Dietary and environmental factors do not appear to have a significant role in thyroid cancer gender disparity. Common somatic mutations in BRAF, rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid carcinomas (RET/PTC) and neurotrophin receptor-tyrosine kinase (NTRK) also do not account for the gender disparity in thyroid cancer. While reproductive factors would seem a logical hypothesis to account for the gender disparity, there appears to be no conclusive effect on the risk of developing thyroid cancer. Recent studies on estrogen receptor status in thyroid cancer show a difference in the receptor subtypes expressed based on the histology of thyroid cancer. Moreover, the response to estrogen is dependent on the specific estrogen receptor expressed in thyroid cancer cells. However, what determines the tumor-specific sex hormone receptor expression is unclear. No established molecular factors appear to explain gender differences in thyroid cancer. Therefore, the application of high-throughput genomic and proteomic approaches to the study of thyroid cancer gender disparity could be helpful for better understanding the molecular basis for gender differences in thyroid and other cancers.",

Functionally, thyroid cancer cell motility in vitro is dependent on group 1 PAKs, particularly PAK1. In this study, we hypothesize that BRAF, a central kinase in PTC tumorigenesis and invasion, regulates thyroid cancer cell motility in part through PAK activation. Using three well-characterized human thyroid cancer cell lines, we demonstrated in all cell lines that BRAF knockdown reduced PAK phosphorylation of direct downstream targets. In contrast, inhibition of MEK activity either pharmacologically or with siRNA did not reduce PAK activity, indicating MEK is dispensable for PAK activity. Inhibition of cell migration through BRAF loss is rescued by overexpression of either constitutive active MEK1 or PAK1, demonstrating that both signaling pathways are involved in BRAF-regulated cell motility. To further characterize BRAF-PAK signaling, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that both exogenously overexpressed and endogenous PAK1 and BRAF co-localize and physically interact, and that this interaction was enhanced in mitosis. Finally, we demonstrated that acute induction of BRAFV600E expression in vivo in murine thyroid glands results in increased PAK expression and activity confirming a positive signaling relationship in vivo. In conclusion, we have identified a signaling pathway in thyroid cancer cells which BRAF activates and physically interacts with PAK and regulates cell motility. ",

Moreover, the impact of BRAF(V600E) mutants on tumour-related patient's death has not been evaluated.;We analysed, by PCR-SSCP and/or PCR-direct sequencing, exons 8, 10, 11 and 15 of BRAF in 113 tumour samples from 49 PTC-patients. Matched lymph node metastases and/or distant metastases (DMs) were screened in 35 patients. Focal changes in the growth pattern or microscopic grade within the primary tumour (Pt) or the metastases were separately genotyped. Mutations at H-, K-, N-ras and PIK3CA exons 9 and 20 were also investigated. For comparison with PTC cases, the BRAF and Ras mutational status was evaluated in 89 specimens obtained from 24 poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas (PDCs) and 36 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATCs).;BRAF(V600E) was found in 13/16 classical PTCs (CL-PTCs), 6/17 follicular variant PTCs (FV-PTCs) and 8/16 mixed (papillary/follicular) PTCs (Mx-PTCs), being significantly associated with CL-PTCs (P = 0.015). BRAF(V600E) segregated with metastatic PTC-cells in 43% of the patients, but only one DM disclosed the mutation. PTC-tumours featuring concurrent less-differentiated foci were BRAF wild-type in both components. Noteworthy, the frequency of BRAF mutations among PDCs and ATCs resulted considerably lower (16.6% and 25%, respectively) than in PTCs (55%). The prevalence of Ras mutations among PDCs and ATCs (46% and 36%, respectively) was, however, much higher than in PTCs (14%). Five (71%) of the patients who died of PTC displayed somatic mutations. Four of them had other gene alteration associated with BRAF(V600E) and the only one that did not, BRAF(V600E) was restricted to the Pt. The occurrence of BRAF(V600E) associated with other genetic events was an independent predictor of DMs during follow-up, recurrence and tumour-related death. Remarkably, two PDCs (8.3%) and five ATCs (14%) revealed concurrent BRAF and Ras mutations.;BRAF(V600E)'alone' does not represent a marker for poor outcome, however, when associated with alterations in other genes identifies a subset of PTCs with increased risk of recurrence and decreased survival.",

This study investigates the expression of CYP24A1 and the effect of BRAF(V600E) on its expression in thyroid cancer.;We investigated 60 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) specimens for CYP24A1 expression and its association with BRAF mutation and disease progression. CYP24A1 expression was measured by real-time RT-PCR, and BRAF(V600E) mutation was detected by PCR-DNA sequencing analysis. The interaction between BRAF(V600E) and CYP24A1 expression was determined by Western blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR.;CYP24A1 expression was increased in PTC as compared to benign multinodular goitre. The expression was further increased in stage III and IV tumours. There is a strong correlation between CYP24A1 overexpression and BRAF(V600E) mutation (P < 0·01). In thyroid cancer cell lines expressing BRAF(V600E) , CYP24A1 expression was significantly higher when compared to those without BRAF(V600E) expression. BRAF(V600E) transgene expression in CAL62 cell line can induce CYP24A1 expression. Furthermore, BRAF(V600E) inhibitor PLX4720 can significantly down-regulate CYP24A1 expression and enhance the antiproliferative effects of calcitriol in thyroid cancer cell lines.;CYP24A1 overexpression is a poor prognostic indicator for PTC and may reflect BRAF(V600E) mutation and MARK activation.

Affected patients typically present with advanced disease where there is little hope for cure using conventional therapeutic modalities. Understanding the genetic alterations underlying the development of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, such as mutational activation of BRAF, could help clarify its relationship with well-differentiated forms of thyroid carcinoma (ie follicular and papillary carcinoma) and could help select patients most likely to benefit from novel therapeutic strategies targeting BRAF. We tested 16 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas for the thymine (T) --> adenine (A) missense mutation at nucleotide 1796 in the BRAF gene using a newly developed assay that employs a novel primer extension method (Mutector assay). Seven of these anaplastic thyroid carcinomas arose in association with a well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, and these were also evaluated. The 1796T --> A mutation was detected in eight (50%) of the anaplastic thyroid carcinomas, in four of five (80%) associated papillary thyroid carcinomas, and in zero of two (0%) associated follicular carcinomas. In all seven cases where anaplastic thyroid carcinoma arose in association with a well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma, BRAF status in the two components was concordant. Like papillary thyroid carcinoma, a significant percentage of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas also harbor BRAF mutations. Indeed, when papillary thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma occur together, they consistently share the same BRAF profile, supporting the notion that many anaplastic thyroid carcinomas actually represent progressive malignant degeneration of a pre-existing well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The high frequency of BRAF mutations in a tumor that is generally regarded as uniformly fatal justifies evaluation of the potential benefits of anti-BRAF therapy for patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.",

Adoptive activation of the RET/PTC-RAS-BRAF axis induced cell proliferation and Matrigel invasion of thyroid follicular cells. Gene expression profiling revealed that the 3 oncogenes activate a common transcriptional program in thyroid cells that includes upregulation of the CXCL1 and CXCL10 chemokines, which in turn stimulate proliferation and invasion. Thus, motile and mitogenic properties are intrinsic to transformed thyroid cells and are governed by an epistatic oncogenic signaling cascade.",

The requirement for BRAF in RET/PTC-mediated MAPK activation and gene expression has not been tested functionally. There are three RAF isoforms: ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF. Compared with the others, ARAF is a much weaker stimulator of MAPK. To determine the key RAF isoform mediating RET/PTC-induced ERK phosphorylation, we stably transfected doxycycline-inducible RET/PTC3-expressing thyroid PCCL3 cells with small interfering RNA vectors to induce selective knockdown of BRAF or CRAF. Conditional RET/PTC3 expression induced comparable ERK phosphorylation in CRAF knockdown and control cells but negligible ERK phosphorylation in BRAF knockdown cells. Selective knockdown of BRAF prevented RET/PTC-dependent down-regulation of the sodium iodide symporter, a gene that confers key biological effects of RET/PTC in PTCs. Moreover, microarray analysis revealed numerous RET/PTC-regulated genes showing requirement of BRAF for appropriate expression. These data indicate that BRAF is required for RET/PTC-induced MAPK activation in thyroid cells and support the notion that BRAF inactivation may be an attractive target for PTCs.",

DESIGN/SETTING AND PATIENTS: We examined the expression of key markers of thyrocyte differentiation in 56 PTCs with BRAF mutations (BRAF-mut) and 37 with wild-type BRAF (BRAF-wt). Eight samples of normal thyroid tissue were analyzed as controls. Quantitative PCR was used to measure mRNA levels for the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), apical iodide transporter (AIT-B), thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroperoxidase (TPO), TSH receptor (TSH-R), the transcription factor PAX8, and glucose transporter type 1 (Glut1). NIS protein expression and localization was also analyzed by immunohistochemistry.;mRNA levels for all thyroid-specific genes were reduced in all PTCs vs. normal thyroid tissues. NIS, AIT-B, Tg, and TPO expression was significantly lower in BRAF-mut tumors than in the BRAF-wt group. Glut-1 transcript levels were increased in all PTCs, and additional increases were noted in BRAF-mut tumors. In both tumor subsets, the NIS protein that was expressed was abnormally retained in the cytoplasm.;BRAF V600E mutation in PTCs is associated with reduced expression of key genes involved in iodine metabolism.

A total of 47 intracerebral melanoma metastases and 21 primary papillary thyroid carcinomas were evaluated by direct sequencing of BRAF and by immunohistochemistry using the BRAF V600E mutation-specific antibody clone VE1. Correlation of VE1 immunohistochemistry and BRAF sequencing revealed a perfect match for both papillary thyroid carcinomas and melanoma metastases. The staining intensity in BRAF V600E mutated tumor samples ranged from weak to strong. The generally homogenous VE1 staining patterns argue against a clonal heterogeneity of the tumors investigated.

To answer this question, the BRAF(V600E) mutational status of individual tumor foci was examined. This approach was justified because in the Korean population a high proportion (65%) of papillary carcinomas harbor the BRAF mutation.;DNA was isolated from paraffin-embedded tissue samples of multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma and the BRAF exon 15 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

However, in PTC without RASSF1A methylation, the regulatory mechanisms of RASSF1A-MST1 pathways remain to be elucidated, and the functional cooperation or cross regulation between BRAF(V600E) and MST1,which activates Foxo3,has not been investigated.;The negative regulators of the cell cycle, p21 and p27, are strongly induced by transcriptional activation of FoxO3 in BRAF(V600E) positive thyroid cancer cells. The FoxO3 transactivation is augmented by RASSF1A and the MST1 signaling pathway. Interestingly, introduction of BRAF(V600E)markedly abolished FoxO3 transactivation and resulted in the suppression of p21 and p27 expression. The suppression of FoxO3 transactivation by BRAF(V600E)is strongly increased by coexpression of MST1 but it is not observed in the cells in which MST1, but not MST2,is silenced. Mechanistically, BRAF(V600E)was able to bind to the C-terminal region of MST1 and resulted in the suppression of MST1 kinase activities. The induction of the G1-checkpoint CDK inhibitors, p21 and p27,by the RASSF1A-MST1-FoxO3 pathway facilitates cellular apoptosis, whereas addition of BRAF(V600E) inhibits the apoptotic processes through the inactivation of MST1. Transgenic induction of BRAF(V600E)in the thyroid gland results in cancers resembling human papillary thyroid cancers.

We analyzed a panel of 93 specimens and 14 thyroid carcinoma cell lines for the presence of BRAF mutations and activation of the mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. We also compared the effect of a B-Raf small inhibitory RNA construct and the B-Raf kinase inhibitor AAL881 on both B-Raf wild-type and mutant thyroid carcinoma cell lines. We found a high prevalence of the T1799A (V600E) mutation in papillary and anaplastic carcinoma specimens and cell lines. There was no difference in patient age, B-Raf expression, Ki67 immunostaining, or clinical stage at presentation between wild-type and BRAF(V600E) specimens. Immunodetection of phosphorylated and total forms of MEK and ERK revealed no difference in their phosphorylation between wild-type and BRAF(V600E) patient specimens or cell lines. Furthermore, a small inhibitory RNA construct targeting the expression of both wild-type B-Raf and B-Raf(V600E) induced a comparable reduction of viability in both wild-type and BRAF(V600E) mutant cancer cells. Interestingly, AAL881 inhibited MEK and ERK phosphorylation and induced apoptosis preferentially in BRAF(V600E)-harboring cells than wild-type ones, possibly because of better inhibitory activity against B-Raf(V600E).

The presence of a minor poorly differentiated (PD) component (mainly insular pattern) might represent an additional critical parameter for patients' prognosis and outcome. The role of both CXCR4 (a chemokine inducing cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell adhesion) and BRAF mutation have been studied in WDC (mainly papillary thyroid cancer and its variants), highlighting their critical role in tumor progression, local infiltration, and metastases. We discussed the clonal heterogeneity through the prognostic role of CXCR4 and BRAF mutation in WDC with a minor PD/insular component. Of our 16 WDC cases with a PD/insular component, up to 40% underwent surgery. The cases were subclassified according to the PD percentage as (1) <20% PD and (2) 20% to 40% PD, and were studied for CXCR4 expression and BRAF mutation. CXCR4 and molecular testing were distinctly performed on both components of each lesion. The majority of the cases (69%) showed an extrathyroid and metastatic dissemination. Regardless of the 2 categories, we had 8/16 (50%) patients with disease-free status. CXCR4 was negative in all 16 cases, whereas 3 of them (19%) had a mutated BRAF only in the WDC component of the lesion. WDCs with a minor PD pattern, even when <20%, showed more aggressive features than pure WDCs and should be entirely considered as PD carcinoma. The absence of CXCR4 expression and BRAF mutation in cancers with a minor PD component underlined different pathogenic and metastatic processes in comparison with WDCs. ",

The TGFβ pathway is predicted to be regulated by miR-17-92 cluster microRNAs. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that inhibit target mRNA translation and have emerged as potent modulators of tumorigenesis. Although the BRAF(V600E) mutation is the most prevalent alteration in thyroid cancer, the impact of iodine intake on BRAF-mediated oncogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of high iodine on miR-17-92 transcriptional regulation and expression in thyroid cells expressing activated BRAF.;Rat thyroid follicular cells that conditionally express BRAF(V600E) under doxycycline stimulation (PC-BRAF(V600E)-6) were derived from the PCCl3 line. These cells were treated with doxycycline for two days, in the absence or presence of 10 μM sodium iodide. The thyroid cancer cell lines BCPAP and KTC2 were also analyzed. Expression of the miR-17-92 cluster and Notch1 was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and expression of these genes was modulated by anti-miR or anti-Notch1 siRNAs transfection. Protein expression was assessed by Western blot. Luciferase assays were used to quantify Smad4 3'-UTR/miR-19 interaction and Notch signaling activation. TGFβ responsiveness was evaluated by cell cycle analysis of TGFβ-treated cells.;High iodine blocked BRAF(V600E)-induced upregulation of miR-17-92, including miR-19a/b. miR-17-92 promoter region analysis revealed a putative binding site for Hes1, a transcription factor responsive to Notch signaling. Notch-1 overexpression resulted in miR-19 upregulation in normal thyroid cells, while Notch-1 knockdown blocked BRAF-induced miR-19 expression. Moreover, in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells, Notch-1 knockdown reduced miR-19. Expression of BRAF(V600E) decreased Smad4 protein in normal thyroid cells. Smad4 was validated as a miR-19 target by luciferase assays, which revealed reduced luminescence associated with miR-19 interaction in Smad4 3'-UTR. Iodine treatment restored Smad4 levels in BRAF-activated cells, resulting in enhanced G1-cell cycle arrest in response to TGFβ. Moreover, this effect was mimicked in papillary thyroid cancer cells treated with anti-miR-19.;High iodine abrogates BRAF(V600E)-induced activation of miR-19, a newly identified Smad4 regulator, through Notch pathway inhibition and restores responsiveness to TGFβ signaling. Our results indicate that iodine exerts protective effects in thyroid cells, attenuating acute BRAF oncogene-mediated microRNA deregulation.",

We have previously shown that activation of raf-1 in TT-raf cells by estradiol suppresses tumor cell growth and calcitonin secretion in vitro. TT-raf cells are a human medullary thyroid cancer cell line that contains an estrogen-inducible raf-1 construct. The in-vivo effects of raf-1 activation in this cell line, however, have not been characterized. Therefore, we utilized TT or TT-raf cells in a murine subcutaneous xenograft model to study tumor development and growth. Activation of raf-1, in mice with TT-raf tumors, led to a significant decrease in medullary thyroid cancer tumor formation. Control groups, however, had a high rate of medullary thyroid cancer tumor development. These data indicate that raf-1 activation by estradiol treatment in this TT-raf xenograft model inhibited tumor development. Furthermore, to determine whether raf-1 activation could also inhibit the growth of established tumors, estradiol and control pellets were implanted after tumor development. The TT-raf group that received estradiol pellets showed an 8-fold decrease in tumor volume compared with the TT-raf control group. Taken together, these results suggest that in-vivo activation of raf-1 in a murine model of medullary thyroid cancer not only led to a reduction in tumor development, but also inhibited the growth of established tumors. These results suggest that strategies to activate the raf-1/MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway may be a viable approach to treat patients with metastatic medullary thyroid cancer.",

Differences in the biology and clinical course of Dtc in children, when compared with adults, may be related both to pathogenesis as well as to clinical outcome of the disease. In childhood, the thyroid gland exhibits higher susceptibility to the carcinogenetic effect of ionizating radiation than in adulthood. Papillary thyroid cancer (Ptc) is more prevalent in children in comparison to adult patients. Among molecular events known to occur in papillary thyroid carcinoma, rEt/Ptc rearrangements exhibit higher prevalence in younger patients, while brAF mutations are very rare in this age group. cancer disease presents at a more advanced stage: 1) primary tumour at diagnosis is larger, especially in relation to the volume of the whole gland; 2) neck lymph node involvement is more commonly observed; 3) distant metastases are detected 3-4 times more frequently than in adults. the lungs are almost the sole distant metastatic site in children and pulmonary metastases are nearly always functional. Additionally, recurrence rates tend to be higher in children; nevertheless, cause-specific cancer mortality remains low. Up to now, thyroid cancer guidelines have been formulated on the basis of experience gained in the general population of patients. the peculiarities in childhood disease raise the question of whether it should be considered a distinct subtype, with specifically tailored therapy recommendations.

        "Doc_abstract":"BRAF-activating mutations have been reported in several types of cancer, including melanoma ( approximately 70% of cases), thyroid (30-70%), ovarian (15-30%), and colorectal cancer (5-20%). Mutant BRAF has constitutive kinase activity and causes hyperactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. BRAF silencing induces regression of melanoma xenografts, indicating the essential role of BRAF for cell survival. We set up an inducible short hairpin RNA system to compare the role of oncogenic BRAF in thyroid carcinoma versus melanoma cells. Although BRAF knockdown led to apoptosis in the melanoma cell line A375, the anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell ARO underwent growth arrest upon silencing, with little or no cell death. Reexpression of the thyroid differentiation marker, sodium iodide symporter, was induced after long-term silencing. The different outcome of BRAF down-regulation in the two cell lines was associated with an opposite regulation of p21(CIP1/WAF1) expression levels in response to the block of the BRAF mitogenic signal. These results were confirmed using a specific BRAF small-molecule inhibitor, PLX4032. Restoration of p21(CIP1/WAF1) expression rescued melanoma cells from death. Altogether, our data indicate that oncogenic BRAF inhibition can have a different effect on cell fate depending on the cellular type. Furthermore, we suggest that a BRAF-independent mechanism of cell survival exists in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells.",

In the first patient, histology, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy demonstrated an MTC in the one nodule and PTC in two additional lesions. Non-neoplastic thyroid parenchyma separated the three nodules. Metastasis from PTC was diagnosed in a regional lymph node. Genetic analysis of both tumour components showed a distinctive mutational pattern: in the MTC a Cys634Arg substitution in exon 11 of the RET gene and in the two PTC foci a Val600Glu substitution in exon 15 of the BRAF gene. The other two patients are members of a large multigenerational family affected with familial MTC due to a germline mutation of the RET gene (Ala891Ser). Both patients harboured, besides medullary cancer and C-cell hyperplasia, distinct foci of papillary thyroid cancer, which was positive for Val600Glu BRAF mutation. Review of the literature disclosed 18 similar lesions reported and allowed the identification of different patterns of clinical presentation and biological behaviour. So far, the pathogenesis of these peculiar cases of thyroid malignancy has been completely unknown, but an underlying common genetic drive has been hypothesised. This is the first report in which two mutations, in the RET and BRAF genes, have been identified in three cases of MTC/PTC collision tumour, thus documenting the different genetic origin of these two coexisting carcinomas.",

Fine-needle aspiration samples were obtained for cytology, immunocytology, and molecular analysis. Immunoblot analysis on thyroid tissues was performed to evaluate the most important tumor activating pathways. Cytology was consistent with \"follicular neoplasia\" (negative for galectin-3 immunostaining); molecular analysis on the cytology sample detected a K601E mutation in the exon 15 of the BRAF gene. After total thyroidectomy with lymph-node dissection, the diagnosis of FTC was established by histopathological examination. The BRAF(K601E) mutation was confirmed in DNA obtained from different areas of the FTC. In addition, an activating mutation (E545A) in the PKI3CA oncogene was found in the FTC. As expected, immunoblot analysis showed activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.;This article describes what may be the first case of a classical FTC carrying a BRAF mutation.

It is relatively indolent, however other types poorly differentiated or anaplastic, are more aggressive and usually associated with poor prognosis. Approximately half of these papillary carcinomas harbor a thymine-to-adenine transversion (T1799A) point mutation, in the gene encoding the serine/threonine-kinase B-type Raf kinase (BRAF), with substitution of valine by glutamate (V600E). Mutated BRAF, generates a constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in transmitting proliferative signals generated by cell surface receptors and cytoplasmic signaling elements, to the nucleus. BRAF mutation is mutually exclusive with other common genetic alterations, supporting its independent oncogenic role in cell proliferation, survival and tumor de-differentiation. The BRAFV600E occurs exclusively in papillary thyroid carcinoma and papillary carcinoma-derived anaplastic cancer, rising as a specific diagnostic marker for this tumor when identified in cytological / histological exams. This mutation has recently emerged, as a potential prognostic marker for papillary thyroid carcinoma, after several studies have found this mutation to be associated with some clinicopathological characteristics, known to predict tumor recurrence and progression, including, for instance, old patient age, extrathyroidal invasion and lymph node metastasis. It is therefore considered a marker of aggressive disease in these tumors, associated with increased cancer recurrence and even loss of radioiodine avidity. Several studies were not able to confirm these associations. It has become clearer that BRAF mutation will likely have significant impact on the clinical management of papillary thyroid carcinoma.",

Papers include: 1) the accuracy and currency of websites on thyroid cancer; 2) the detection of the V600E BRAF mutation in very small papillary thyroid cancers that are detected histologically; 3) the relationship between thyroid cancer and Hashimoto's thyroiditis or hepatitis C virus, an association that appears to be nonrandom; 4) the not negligible frequency of coexistence of thyroid cancer with primary hyperparathyroidism; 5) the value of ultrasound elastography of thyroid nodules in distinguishing malignant form benign lesions; 6) the value of percutaneous ethanol injection in the treatment of thyroid or nodal recurrences of thyroid cancer; 7) the relatively benign course of intrathyroid metastases from renal cell carcinoma; 8) the exceedingly rare thyroid paraganglioma, though the rate of reports has increased recently; and 9) the increase in serum calcitonin caused by chronic alcoholism, an increase that cannot be reversed by three weeks of alcohol weaning.",

By showing promoter methylation-induced gene silencing in PTC-derived cell lines, we first demonstrated the functional consequence of methylation of several recently identified tumor suppressor genes, including those for tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP3), SLC5A8, death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) and retinoic acid receptor beta2 (RARbeta2). We then investigated the role of methylation of these genes in the aggressiveness of PTC by examining the relationship of their aberrant methylation to clinicopathological characteristics and BRAF mutation in 231 primary PTC tumors. Methylation of TIMP3, SLC5A8 and DAPK was significantly associated with several aggressive features of PTC, including extrathyroidal invasion, lymph node metastasis, multifocality and advanced tumor stages. Methylation of these genes was also significantly associated with BRAF mutation in PTC, either individually or collectively in various combinations. Methylation of these genes, either individually or collectively, occurred more frequently in more aggressive classical and tall-cell PTC subtypes than in less aggressive follicular-variant PTC, with the latter known to infrequently harbor BRAF mutation. Several other tumor suppressor genes investigated were not methylated. These results suggest that aberrant methylation and hence silencing of TIMP3, SLC5A8, DAPK and RARbeta2, in association with BRAF mutation, may be an important step in PTC tumorigenesis and progression.",

BRAF mutation is seen in melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (including papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from ovarian teratoma), ovarian serous tumours, colorectal carcinoma, gliomas, hepatobiliary carcinomas and hairy cell leukaemia. In these cancers, various genetic aberrations of the BRAF proto-oncogene, such as different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, have been reported. The most common mutation, BRAF V600E, can be detected by DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumour tissue. Detection of BRAF V600E mutation has the potential for clinical use as a diagnostic and prognostic marker. In addition, a great deal of research effort has been spent in strategies inhibiting its activity. Indeed, recent clinical trials involving BRAF selective inhibitors exhibited promising response rates in metastatic melanoma patients. Clinical trials are underway for other cancers. However, cutaneous side effects of treatment have been reported and therapeutic response to cancer is short-lived due to the emergence of several resistance mechanisms. In this review, we give an update on the clinical pathological relevance of BRAF mutation in cancer. It is hoped that the review will enhance the direction of future research and assist in more effective use of the knowledge of BRAF mutation in clinical practice.",

Methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) was used for detection of promoter methylation while BRAF gene mutational status was analyzed by PCR followed by DNA sequencing in the same series of 60 thyroid tumor tissues. The promoter region of TSHR gene was found to be methylated in 25 % (15 of 60) of the thyroid cancer patients. Patients having elevated TSH levels showed strong association with methylation (OR = 4.0, P = 0.02). BRAF V600E mutation was found in 25 % (15 of 60) patients and among them TSHR promoter was methylated in 73.3 % (11 of 15) patients and only 26.7 % (4 of 15) patients with mutated BRAF showed the absence of TSHR promoter methylation. We found a significant association between the presence of methylation in TSHR with the BRAF V600E mutation-positive cases (P < 0.05).

The sensitivity and specificity were calculated. We analysed the association between BRAF(V600E) mutation and the clinico-pathological parameters.;The BRAF(V600E) mutation was present in 93 (83%) of 112 thyroid cancers. Direct DNA sequencing showed a sensitivity of 83.0% and a specificity of 96.0%. The sensitivity and specificity of PCR-RFLP were 78.6% and 80.0%, respectively. Among 25 cases with indeterminate FNAB cytology, 8 patients had malignant lesions (5 PTC and 3 FTC). Three (60%) of 5 PTCs and 1 out of 17 benign lesions had BRAF(V600E) mutation (only one false positive case and the definitive pathology showed atypical nodular hyperplasia that could be a premalignant lesion). The diagnostic accuracy of this molecular method in only the 25 indeterminate nodules was 76% (19/25). No mutation was found in 3 FTCs. Among 107 PTCs, there was no significant association of the BRAF(V600E) mutation with the known risk factors.;Detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in FNAB specimens refines the FNAB-cytology diagnosis, especially in a BRAF(V600E) mutation-prevalent area.

PTC represents 80-90% of all thyroid cancers and over the past five years, more than 200 manuscripts have been published about the relationship between \"B-Raf(V600E) and thyroid cancer\". B-Raf(V600E) genetically arises from a transversion point mutation (valine-to-glutamate substitution at amino acid residue-600, V600E) and leads to over activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway. The MAPK pathway is essential for transmitting proliferation signals generated by cell surface receptors and cytoplasmic signaling elements to the nucleus. In many cancers, including thyroid cancer, B-Raf(V600E) appears to play a crucial role in cell proliferation, survival and de-differentiation. In thyroid cancer, the V600E mutation occurs with greater frequently in aggressive subtypes of PTC, and in individuals that present at advanced stages of disease with extra-thyroidal extension and/or lymph node metastases. B-Raf(V600E) is considered a marker of aggressive disease in both PTC (>1 cm) and micro-PTC (</=1 cm), and interestingly, is associated with both loss of I-131 avidity and PTC recurrence. Though treatment of patients with thyroid cancer is usually successful and most patients are rendered disease-free, to date there are no effective therapies for patients with invasive, non-radioiodine sensitive tumors or metastatic disease. In this article we will review the relation between B-Raf(V600E) and PTC, as well as both non-selective and selective pharmacological agents currently under investigation for treatment of B-Raf(V600E) positive PTC.",

They include BRAF(V600E) and AKT that affect tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. Human thyroid cancer orthotopic mouse models are based on human cell lines that generally harbor genetic alterations found in human thyroid cancers. They can reproduce in vivo and in situ (into the thyroid) many features of aggressive and refractory human advanced thyroid carcinomas, including local invasion and metastasis. Humanized orthotopic mouse models seem to be ideal and commonly used for preclinical and translational studies of compounds and therapies not only because they may mimic key aspects of human diseases (e.g. metastasis), but also for their reproducibility. In addition, they might provide the possibility to evaluate systemic effects of treatments. So far, human thyroid cancer in vivo models were mainly used to test single compounds, non selective and selective. Despite the greater antitumor activity and lower toxicity obtained with different selective drugs in respect to non-selective ones, most of them are only able to delay disease progression, which ultimately could restart with similar aggressive behavior. Aggressive thyroid tumors (for example, anaplastic or poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma) carry several complex genetic alterations that are likely cooperating to promote disease progression and might confer resistance to single-compound approaches. Orthotopic models of human thyroid cancer also hold the potential to be good models for testing novel combinatorial therapies. In this article, we will summarize results on preclinical testing of selective and nonselective single compounds in orthotopic mouse models based on validated human thyroid cancer cell lines harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation or with wild-type BRAF.

        "Doc_abstract":"Constitutive ERK activation is a common finding in human cancer and is often the result of activating mutations of BRAF and RAS. BRAF missense mutations occur in approximately 8% of human tumors, most frequently in melanoma, papillary thyroid cancer and colon cancer. Mutations in BRAF have been found predominantly in tumors in which RAS is commonly mutated but concurrent mutations of both BRAF and RAS are extremely rare. Though over 40 different kinase domain mutations in BRAF have been identified, a single base-pair substitution in exon 15 at codon 600 (V600E) is found in over 80% of cases. These mutations cluster in the glycine-rich loop and activation segments of the kinase and are predicted to induce kinase activation by disrupting the inhibitory glycine-rich loop/activation segment interaction which characterizes the inactive conformation. The majority of mutations identified cause constitutive kinase activation with the V600E mutation demonstrating approximately 500-fold greater kinase activity than wild-type BRAF. Supporting its classification as an oncogene, V600E BRAF stimulates ERK signaling, induces proliferation and is capable in model systems of promoting transformation. However, BRAF mutations are common in nevi and colon polyps suggesting that BRAF mutation alone is insufficient for tumorigenesis and additional mutations are required for cancer development. Though such data suggest that BRAF mutation is likely an early initiating event in tumors such as melanoma and colon cancer, preclinical studies suggest that tumors with V600E BRAF mutation remain dependent upon BRAF for proliferation and survival. Given its frequent occurrence in human cancer and the continued requirement for BRAF activity in tumors with BRAF mutation, efforts are underway to develop targeted inhibitors of BRAF and its downstream effectors. The first generation of RAF inhibitors, including sorafenib, were notable for their lack of specificity and potency for RAF and these agents have shown limited efficacy in tumors with a high incidence of BRAF mutation such as melanoma. Novel inhibitors of the pathway with greater selectivity for BRAF and MEK are now in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials with promising early results. To maximize the likelihood of success with these agents, clinical trials enriched with patients whose tumors possess BRAF and RAS mutations have been proposed.",

The aim of the present study was to disclose the role of BRAF mutations in thyroid carcinoma development. Seventy-two thyroid tumors, including 60 PTCs, six follicular adenomas, five follicular carcinomas, and one anaplastic carcinoma, were studied. BRAF mutation screening focused on exon 15 and exon 11 of the gene by single-stranded conformational polymorphism and sequence analysis. Search of RET/PTC expression was conducted with the RT-PCR technique. The molecular genetic study of the BRAF gene showed the presence of a missense thymine to adenine transversion at nucleotide 1796, resulting in the V599E substitution, in 24 of 60 PTCs (40%), none of six follicular adenomas, and none of five follicular carcinomas or one anaplastic carcinoma. Moreover, nine of 60 PTCs (15%) presented RET/PTC expression. A genetico-clinical association analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between BRAF mutation and development of PTCs of the classic papillary histotype (P = 0.038). On the contrary, no link could be detected between expression of BRAF(V599E) and age at diagnosis, gender, dimension, and local invasiveness of the primary cancer, presence of lymph node metastases, tumor stage, and multifocality of the disease. These data clearly confirm that BRAF(V599E) is the more common genetic alteration found to date in adult sporadic PTCs, that it is unique for this thyroid cancer histotype, and that it might drive the development of PTCs of the classic papillary subtype.",

We examined the T1799A BRAF mutation by direct genomic DNA sequencing in 108 primary PTC samples from a Chinese cohort and analyzed its relationship with clinicopathological, hematological, and other laboratory results as well as the levels of expression of PDGF in tumors. We found that the BRAF mutation was significantly associated with extrathyroidal invasion and advanced tumor stages III and IV. Specifically, extrathyroidal invasion was seen in 30/54 (56%) PTC with BRAF mutation versus 18/54 (33%) PTC without the mutation (P=0.02). Tumor stages III and IV were seen in 16/54 (30%) PTC with BRAF mutation versus 7/54 (13%) PTC without the mutation (P=0.04). The BRAF mutation was also significantly associated with a higher platelet count, with 249.28+/-53.76 x 10(9)/l in the group of patients with BRAF mutation versus 207.79+/-58.98 x 10(9)/l in the group without the mutation (P=0.001).

The BRAF T1799A-positive PTC tissues harbored a significantly higher level of PDGF-B than BRAF T1799A-negative PTC tissues.

However, additional cellular effects caused by subcellular action of BRAF(V600E) remain to be identified.;To explore these effects, differences in the subcellular localization of wild-type and mutant BRAF in thyroid cancer were investigated.;A significant proportion of endogenous and exogenous BRAF(V600E), but not wild-type BRAF, was detected in the mitochondrial fraction, similar to other BRAF mutants including BRAF(V600D), BRAF(V600K), BRAF(V600R), and BRAF(G469A), which showed elevated kinase activity and mitochondrial localization. Induced expression of BRAF(V600E) suppressed the apoptotic responses against staurosporine and TNFα/cycloheximide. Interestingly, the mitochondrial localization and antiapoptotic activities of BRAF(V600E) were unaffected by sorafenib and U0126 suppression of MAPK kinase (MEK) and ERK activities. Similarly, although the RAF inhibitor sorafenib effectively inhibited MEK/ERK activation, it did not block the mitochondrial localization of BRAF(V600E). In addition, inducible expression of BRAF(V600E) increased the glucose uptake rate and decreased O(2) consumption, suggesting that BRAF(V600E) reduces mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, a signature feature of cancer cells. Again, these metabolic alterations resulted by BRAF(V600E) expression were not affected by the treatment of thyroid cells by sorafenib. Therefore, RAF and MEK inhibitors are unable to block the antiapoptotic activity of BRAF(V600E) or correct the high glucose uptake rate and glycolytic activity and suppressed mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation induced by BRAF(V600E).;The mitochondrial localization observed in oncogenic BRAF mutants might be related to their altered responses to apoptotic stimuli and characteristic metabolic phenotypes found in thyroid cancer. The inability of MEK and RAF inhibitors, U0126 and sorafenib, respectively, to block the mitochondrial localization of BRAF(V600E) has additional therapeutic implications for BRAF(V600E)-positive thyroid cancers.",

The development of small molecule inhibitors of mutant BRAF kinase has changed the care of patients, especially with melanoma. Despite the success in treating melanoma with inhibitors of mutant BRAF and other elements of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) pathway, resistance limits the long-term responsiveness to these drugs. The resistance mechanisms to MAPK pathway inhibition are complex, occur at genomic and phenotypic levels, and frequently the same patient can simultaneously develop diverse mechanisms of resistance in different progressive metastases or even in the same lesion. In the current review, we summarize recent research on mutations in BRAF and their importance for the development of tumor.

Seventy-six PTCs (52.8%) showed unequivocal diffuse cytoplasmic expression of the mutated BRAF protein, and the T1799A point mutation was confirmed by sequencing analysis in selected cases. No statistical difference in V600E BRAF protein expression was seen between microcarcinomas and macrocarcinomas.

BRAF V600E protein expression was significantly more common in tumors with tall cell or oncocytic features but was less common in tumors with follicular growth pattern. Diffuse sclerosing, solid and follicular variants did not show the mutated BRAF protein.

In this study, we detected the expression of the heavy chain of IgG (IgGγ) and kappa light chain (Igκ) in papillary thyroid cancer cells. Using in situ hybridization, we detected the constant region of human IgG1 (IGHG1) in papillary thyroid cancer cells. With laser capture microdissection followed by RT-PCR, mRNA transcripts of IGHG1, Igκ, recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1), RAG2, and activation-induced cytidine deaminase genes were successfully amplified from isolated papillary thyroid cancer cells. We further confirmed IgG protein expression with immunohistochemistry and found that none of the IgG receptors was expressed in papillary thyroid cancer. Differences in the level of IgGγ expression between tumor size, between papillary thyroid cancer and normal thyroid tissue, as well as between papillary thyroid cancer with and without lymph node metastasis were significant. Taken together, these results indicate that IgG is produced by papillary thyroid cancer cells and that it might be positively related to the growth and metastasis of papillary thyroid cancer cells. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that IgGγ colocalized with complement proteins in the same cancer cells, which could indicate that immune complexes were formed. Such immune complexes might consist of IgG synthesized by the host against tumor surface antigens and locally produced anti-idiotypic IgG with specificity for the variable region of these 'primary' antibodies. The cancer cells might thus escape the host tumor-antigen-specific immune responses, hence promoting tumor progression.",

Finally, analysis of human thyroid carcinomas indicated that MAP kinase-positive thyroid tumors-as detected by immunostaining for p-ERK - presented high p27 degradative activity and low levels of p27 protein (n = 30; p < 0.05).

Using gene set enrichment analysis and in vitro and in vivo functional studies, we identified and validated a B-Raf(V600E) gene set signature associated with tumor progression in PTCs. An independent cohort of B-Raf(V600E)-positive PTCs showed significantly higher expression levels of many extracellular matrix genes compared with controls. We performed extensive in vitro and in vivo validations on thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), because it has been previously shown to be important in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis and metastasis and is present in abundance in tumor stroma. Knockdown of B-Raf(V600E) resulted in TSP-1 down-regulation and a reduction of adhesion and migration/invasion of human thyroid cancer cells. Knockdown of TSP-1 resulted in a similar phenotype. B-Raf(V600E) cells in which either B-Raf(V600E) or TSP-1 were knocked down were implanted orthotopically into the thyroids of immunocompromised mice, resulting in significant reduction in tumor size and fewer pulmonary metastases from the primary carcinoma as compared with the control cells. Treatment of orthotopic thyroid tumors, initiated 1 week after tumor cell implantation with PLX4720, an orally available selective inhibitor of B-Raf(V600E), caused a significant tumor growth delay and decreased distant metastases, without evidence of toxicity. In conclusion, B-Raf(V600E) plays an important role in PTC progression through genes (i.e., TSP-1) important in tumor invasion and metastasis. Testing of a patient's thyroid cancer for B-Raf(V600E) will yield important information about potential tumor aggressiveness and also allow for future use of targeted therapies with selective B-Raf(V600E) inhibitors, such as PLX4720.",

Owing to the lack of effective treatment options, ATC has a mortality rate of ∼100% and median survival of less than 5 months. RNAi nanotechnology represents a promising strategy for cancer therapy through nanoparticle (NP) -mediated delivery of RNAi agents (e.g., siRNA) to solid tumors for specific silencing of target genes driving growth and/or metastasis. Nevertheless, the clinical success of RNAi cancer nanotherapies remains elusive in large part because of the suboptimal systemic siRNA NP delivery to tumors and the fact that tumor heterogeneity produces variable NP accumulation and thus, therapeutic response. To address these challenges, we here present an innovative theranostic NP platform composed of a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent polymer for effective in vivo siRNA delivery to ATC tumors and simultaneous tracking of the tumor accumulation by noninvasive NIR imaging. The NIR polymeric NPs are small (∼50 nm), show long blood circulation and high tumor accumulation, and facilitate tumor imaging. Systemic siRNA delivery using these NPs efficiently silences the expression of V-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) in tumor tissues and significantly suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model of ATC. These results suggest that this theranostic NP system could become an effective tool for NIR imaging-guided siRNA delivery for personalized treatment of advanced malignancies. ",

PKM2 expression in PTC correlated with clinicopathological features and the BRAF mutation. PTC cells were transfected with small interfering RNA against PKM2. PKM2 expression in cells was analyzed by Western blotting and real-time RT-PCR. Cell growth was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Lactate and ATP production and glucose consumption by cells were determined using commercial assay kits.;PKM2 was aberrantly overexpressed in PTC. This overexpression was associated with poor clinicopathological features including advanced tumor stages and lymph node metastasis. More intensive immunostaining of PKM2 was detected in PTCs harboring the BRAF mutation. Specific small interfering RNA against PKM2 in PTC cell lines retarded cell growth both in vitro and in xenograft mouse models. PKM2 knockdown also reduced lactate and ATP production and glucose consumption by PTC cells.;We conclude that overexpression of PKM2 provides a selective growth advantage for PTC cells through activation of glycolysis.

The v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) valine (V) to glutamic acid (E) substitution at codon 600 (BRAF(V600E)) is the most effective diagnostic/prognostic marker and is used mainly for papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). Although BRAF(V600E) represents 95% of all BRAF mutations, uncommon BRAF mutations have been identified in thyroid carcinomas. For the current study, the authors evaluated morphologic (plump pink cells and sickle-shaped nuclei) anti-BRAF(V600E) antibody (VE1) immunocytochemical and molecular findings of BRAF mutations in PTCs and in the follicular variant of PTC (FVPC).;Between January 2013 and June 2014, there were 150 cytologic samples with surgical follow-up at the authors' institution. BRAF mutations, which were identified using liquid-based cytology, were classified into wild-type BRAF, BRAF(V600E), and uncommon BRAF mutations. All clinicopathologic correlations between BRAF and FVPCs were analyzed.;Forty-four of 150 samples were identified as benign histologic lesions, and the authors focused on the 106 cytologic samples from patients who had malignant outcomes (60 PTCs and 46 FVPCs). The series included 16 follicular neoplasms, 36 samples diagnosed as suspicious of malignancy, and 54 samples diagnosed as positive for malignancy. The BRAF(V600E) mutation was detected in 17.4% of FVPCs and in 66.6% of PTCs, whereas uncommon BRAF mutations were detected only in FVPCs. Plump pink cells and VE1 expression were not identified in samples that had uncommon BRAF mutations. VE1 immunocytochemistry yielded positive results in all 36 samples that had the BRAF(V600E) mutation.;Uncommon BRAF mutations were observed only in FVPCs and were linked to less aggressive behavior. Negative/weak VE1 expression was observed in both wild-type and uncommon BRAF mutations. The current investigation did not reveal any plump cells or morphologic BRAF findings in samples that had uncommon BRAF mutations.

Moreover, mutations in the BRAF gene have recently been suggested as an alternate predominant cause of colorectal and papillary thyroid cancers without ras mutations. Similar to neoplasms of other organs mutations of all three ras genes can be found in thyroid tumors. In our set of 40 cold thyroid adenoma and adenomatous nodules ras mutations were detected in only a single case. We therefore tested these hypofunctional tumors for BRAF mutations. Genomic DNA was extracted from nodular and surrounding tissue. Mutational hot spots in exons 11 and 15 of the BRAF gene were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to screen for mutations. No point mutation could be found in the two exons of the BRAF gene.

This study set out to elucidate the molecular pathways of Taxol effects in human anaplastic thyroid cancer cells using as an experimental model four cell lines, ARO, KTC-2, KTC-3 (anaplastic thyroid cancer), and FRO (undifferentiated follicular cancer), and primary thyrocytes. All cell lines were sensitive to Taxol, although to different extent. In primary thyrocytes the drug displayed substantially lower cytotoxicity. In thyroid cancer cells, Taxol-induced changes characteristic to apoptosis such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and procaspase cleavage and alteration of membrane asymmetry only within a narrow concentration range, from 6 to 50 nm. At higher concentration, other form(s) of cell death perhaps associated with mitochondrial collapse was observed. Low doses of Taxol enhanced Bcl2 phosphorylation and led to its degradation observed on the background of a sustained or increasing Bax level and accumulation of survivin and X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis. c-jun-NH(2) terminal kinase activation was essential for the apoptosis in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells, whereas Raf/MAPK kinase/ERK and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/Akt were likely to comprise main survival mechanisms. Our results suggest an importance of cautious interpreting of biological effects of Taxol in laboratory studies and for determining optimal doses of Taxol to achieve the desired therapeutic effect in anaplastic thyroid cancers.",

Pathological features were reviewed and immunohistochemistry for BRAF V600E was also performed.;Seven out of 273 cases (2.6%) had BRAF mutations (three males and four females, median age 70 years, all smokers), with six adenocarcinomas and one NSCLC, not otherwise specified (NOS). All had wild-type EGFR and KRAS. The identified BRAF mutations were V600E (4/7, 58%), K601N, L597Q and G469V. BRAF V600E immunohistochemistry was positive in two cases with V600E and negative in one case with K601N (tissue available in three cases only). No significant difference in age or gender was found (BRAF mutant vs. wild-type).;BRAF mutations occur in a small proportion of NSCLC that lack other driver mutations. The clinicopathological profile differs from that of EGFR mutant tumours. The potential benefits of BRAF-inhibitors should be investigated.",

Targeted next-generation sequencing was performed to investigate the mutational profile of ATC using a massive parallel sequencing approach.;DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival samples of 11 ATCs and normal matched pairs were used. A total of 48 genetic alterations were identified by targeted exome sequencing. These alterations were validated by mass spectrometric genotyping and direct Sanger sequencing.;The most commonly mutated gene was BRAF, identified in 10 samples (91%), all showing the V600E point mutation. A KRAS point mutation was observed in the one sample (9%) without the BRAF(V600E) mutation. All 11 ATCs harbored BRAF or RAS mutations, reflecting the possibility that differentiated thyroid carcinomas progress to ATCs after the accumulation of mutations. A loss of function mutation of TP53 was observed in eight samples (73%), a PIK3CA mutation was observed in two samples (18%), and a frameshift mutation of PTEN was observed in one sample (9%). Twenty-eight novel mutated genes were found that had not previously been associated with ATC. Of these, loss of function mutations of NF2, KMT2D, and PKHD1 were repeatedly seen in three samples (27%), two samples (18%), and two samples (18%), respectively. Using direct Sanger sequencing, two samples (18%) were also found with a RASAL1 mutation. KMT2D and RASAL1 mutations were significantly associated with shorter ATC patient survival.;This comprehensive analysis of ATCs using targeted massive parallel sequencing identified several novel mutations in ATCs, such as loss of function mutations of NF2 or KMT2D.

We examined the pattern of gene expression after activation of these oncoproteins in thyroid PCCL3 cells, with the goal of identifying pathways or gene subsets that may account for the phenotypic differences observed in human cancers. We hybridized cDNA from cells treated with or without doxycycline to induce expression of BRAF(V600E), RET/PTC3, or RET/PTC3 with small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of BRAF, respectively, to slides arrayed with a rat 70-mer oligonucleotide library consisting of 27,342 oligos. Among the RET/PTC3-induced genes, 2,552 did not require BRAF as they were similarly regulated by RET/PTC3 with or without BRAF knockdown and not by expression of BRAF(V600E). Immune response and IFN-related genes were highly represented in this group. About 24% of RET/PTC3-regulated genes were BRAF dependent, as they were similarly modified by RET/PTC3 and BRAF(V600E) but not in cells expressing RET/PTC3 with knockdown of BRAF. A gene cluster coding for components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain pathway was down-regulated in this group, potentially altering regulation of cell viability. Metalloproteinases were also preferentially induced by BRAF, particularly matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3), MMP9, and MMP13. Accordingly, conditional expression of BRAF was associated with markedly increased invasion into Matrigel compared with cells expressing RET/PTC3. The preferential induction of MMPs by BRAF could explain in part the more invasive behavior of thyroid cancers with BRAF mutations.",

Iodide uptake requires expression of critical genes that are involved in various steps of thyroid hormone biosynthesis. ERK signaling, which is markedly increased in thyroid cancer cells driven by oncogenic BRAF, represses the genetic program that enables iodide transport. Here, we determined that a critical threshold for inhibition of MAPK signaling is required to optimally restore expression of thyroid differentiation genes in thyroid cells and in mice with BrafV600E-induced thyroid cancer. Although the MEK inhibitor selumetinib transiently inhibited ERK signaling, which subsequently rebounded, the MEK inhibitor CKI suppressed ERK signaling in a sustained manner by preventing RAF reactivation. A small increase in ERK inhibition markedly increased the expression of thyroid differentiation genes, increased iodide accumulation in cancer cells, and thereby improved responses to RAI therapy. Only a short exposure to the drug was necessary to obtain a maximal response to RAI. These data suggest that potent inhibition of ERK signaling is required to adequately induce iodide uptake and indicate that this is a promising strategy for the treatment of BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer.",

A comprehensive survey of oncogenic mutations in the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma according to its encapsulated and infiltrative forms has not been performed. Paraffin tissue from 28 patients with encapsulated and 19 with infiltrative follicular variant were subjected to mass spectrometry genotyping encompassing the most significant oncogenes in thyroid carcinomas: 111 mutations in RET, BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, PIK3CA, AKT1 and other related genes. There was no difference in age, gender, tumor size and angioinvasion between encapsulated or infiltrative tumors. Infiltrative carcinomas had a much higher frequency of extrathyroid extension, positive margins and nodal metastases than encapsulated tumors (P<0.05). The BRAF 1799T>A mutation was found in 5 of 19 (26%) of the infiltrative tumor and in none of the encapsulated carcinomas (P=0.007). In contrast, RAS mutations were observed in 10 of 28 (36%) of the encapsulated group (5 NRAS_Q61R, 3 HRAS_Q61, 1 HRAS_G13C and 1 KRAS_Q61R) and in only 2 of 19 (10%) of infiltrative tumors (P=0.09). One encapsulated carcinoma showed a PAX8/PPARgamma rearrangement, whereas two infiltrative tumors harbored RET/PTC fusions. Encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas have a molecular profile very close to follicular adenomas/carcinomas (high rate of RAS and absence of BRAF mutations).

In this study we aim to better characterize molecular effects and efficacy of sorafenib against thyroid carcinoma cells with various histological origins and different BRAF mutational status. Analysis of different signaling pathways affected by sorafenib may contribute to assist a more specific therapy choice with fewer side effects. Twelve thyroid carcinoma cell lines derived from anaplastic, follicular and papillary thyroid carcinomas with wildtype or mutationally activated BRAF were treated with sorafenib. Growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, cell death induction and inhibition of intracellular signaling pathways were then comprehensively analyzed.;Cell viability was analyzed by MTT assay, and the cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining. Cell death was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase liberation assays, caspase activity assays and subG1 peak determinations. Inhibition of intracellular pathways was analyzed in dot blot and western blot analyses.;Sorafenib inhibited proliferation of all thyroid carcinoma cell lines tested with IC50 values ranging between 1.85 and 4.2 μM. Cells derived from papillary carcinoma harboring the mutant BRAF (V600E) allele were slightly more sensitive to sorafenib than those harboring wildtype BRAF. Cell cycle analyses and caspase assays showed a sorafenib-dependent induction of apoptosis in all cell lines, whereas increased lactate dehydrogenase release suggested cell membrane disruption. Sorafenib treatment caused a rapid inhibition of various MAP kinases in addition to inhibiting AKT and receptor tyrosine kinases.;Sorafenib inhibited multiple intracellular signaling pathways in thyroid carcinoma cells, which resulted in cell cycle arrest and the initiation of apoptosis. Sorafenib was effective against all thyroid carcinoma cell lines regardless of their tumor subtype origin or BRAF status, confirming that sorafenib is therapeutically beneficial for patients with any subtype of dedifferentiated thyroid cancer. Inhibition of single intracellular targets of sorafenib in thyroid carcinoma cells may allow the development of more specific therapeutic intervention with less side effects.",

The minute size (<1 mm) of the clusters and the incomplete nuclear changes precluded a diagnosis of papillary microcarcinoma. The atypical cell clusters from all 12 cases were negative for BRAF. The absence of the BRAF mutation in these atypical cell clusters suggests that they may not be preneoplastic. Caution should be exercised in interpreting positive HBME1 or CK19 staining in Hashimoto thyroiditis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Mutational activation of BRAF leading to expression of the BRAF(V600E) oncoprotein was recently identified in a high percentage of specific hematopoietic neoplasms in monocyte/histiocyte and mature B-cell lineages. Although BRAF(V600E) is a driver oncoprotein and pharmacologic target in solid tumors such as melanoma, lung, and thyroid cancer, it remains unknown whether BRAF(V600E) is an appropriate therapeutic target in hematopoietic neoplasms. To address this critical question, we generated a mouse model expressing inducible BRAF(V600E) in the hematopoietic system, and evaluated the efficacy of pathway-targeted therapeutics against primary hematopoietic cells. In this model, BRAF(V600E) expression conferred cytokine-independent growth to monocyte/macrophage-lineage progenitors leading to aberrant in vivo and in vitro monocyte/macrophage expansion. Furthermore, transplantation of BRAF(V600E)-expressing bone marrow cells promoted an in vivo pathology most notable for monocytosis in hematopoietic tissues and visceral organs. In vitro analysis revealed that MAP-ERK kinase inhibition, but not RAF inhibition, effectively suppressed cytokine-independent clonal growth of monocyte/macrophage-lineage progenitors. However, combined RAF and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition effectively inhibited cytokine-independent colony formation, suggesting autocrine PI3K pathway activation. Taken together, these results provide evidence that constitutively activated BRAF(V600E) drives aberrant proliferation of monocyte-lineage cells.;This study supports the development of pathway-targeted therapeutics in the treatment of BRAF(V600E)-expressing hematopoietic neoplasms in the monocyte/histiocyte lineage.",

Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB have been shown to play an important role in thyroid cancer. In particular, TIMP-1 binds its receptor CD63 on cell surface membrane and activates Akt signaling pathway, which is eventually responsible for its anti-apoptotic activity. The aim of our study was to evaluate whether interplay among these three factors exists and exerts a functional role in PTCs. To this purpose, 56 PTC specimens were analyzed for BRAF(V600E) mutation, TIMP-1 expression, and NF-κB activation. We found that BRAF(V600E) mutation occurs selectively in PTC nodules and is associated with hyperactivation of NF-κB and upregulation of both TIMP-1 and its receptor CD63. To assess the functional relationship among these factors, we first silenced BRAF gene in BCPAP cells, harboring BRAF(V600E) mutation. We found that silencing causes a marked decrease in TIMP-1 expression and NF-κB binding activity, as well as decreased invasiveness. After treatment with specific inhibitors of MAPK pathway, we found that only sorafenib was able to increase IκB-α and reduce both TIMP-1 expression and Akt phosphorylation in BCPAP cells, indicating that BRAF(V600E) activates NF-κB and this pathway is MEK-independent. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that BRAF(V600E) causes upregulation of TIMP-1 via NF-κB. TIMP-1 binds then its surface receptor CD63, leading eventually to Akt activation, which in turn confers antiapoptotic behavior and promotion of cell invasion. The recognition of this functional trilogy provides insight on how BRAF(V600E) determines cancer initiation, progression, and invasiveness in PTC, also identifying new therapeutic targets for the treatment of highly aggressive forms.",

These deletions are mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations and occur in 4.21% of KRAS wild-type pancreatic cancer. siRNA knockdown in cells harboring BRAF deletions showed that the MAPK activity and cell growth are BRAF dependent. Structurally, the BRAF deletions are predicted to shorten the β3/αC-helix loop and hinder its flexibility by locking the helix in the active αC-helix-in conformation that favors dimer formation. Expression of L485-P490-deleted BRAF is able to transform NIH/3T3 cells in a BRAF dimer-dependent manner. BRAF homodimer is confirmed to be the dominant RAF dimer by proximity ligation assays in BRAF deletion cells, which are resistant to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and sensitive to LY3009120, a RAF dimer inhibitor. In tumor models with BRAF deletions, LY3009120 has shown tumor growth regression, whereas vemurafenib is inactive.;This study discovered oncogenic BRAF deletions with a distinct activation mechanism dependent on the BRAF dimer formation in tumor cells.

These two alterations did not coexist in any PTCs. The mean age at exposure of patients with PTC showing BRAF mutation was higher than that of patients with tumors without BRAF mutation irrespective of their RET status.

Over the last few years, the knowledge of the molecular processes controlling the mitotic phase of the cell cycle has increased considerably, and different mitotic proteins, whose expression or function has been found altered in human cancer tissues, have been associated to tumour genetic instability and aneuploidy. These include the three members of the Aurora kinase family (Aurora-A, -B and -C), serine/threonine kinases that regulate multiple aspects of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. The genes encoding the Aurora kinases have been shown to induce cell malignant transformation, and their overexpression has been detected in several tumor derived cell lines and tissues, being often associated with a poor prognosis. Over the last decade, specific inhibitors of Aurora kinases exhibited in preclinical and early phase clinical studies a good therapeutic efficacy against several tumour types, including the highly aggressive anaplastic thyroid cancer and the medullary thyroid cancer. In the present review we'll first focus on the Aurora mitotic functions in normal cells; then we shall describe the main implications of their overexpression in the onset of genetic instability and consequent aneuploidy.

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) originates from parafollicular C cells of the thyroid and accounts for 3-12% of all thyroid cancers. As opposed to other types of dedifferentiated thyroid tumours, MTC cells are highly functional, producing and secreting high amounts of calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen. As parafollicular C cells are of neural crest origin, MTC acts as a neuroendocrine tumour also and expresses somatostatin receptors. Although conventional radiological methods such as ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are widely used in the primary diagnosis and staging, they often fail to localize the residual or recurrent disease because the majority of MTC recurrence presents as occult disease. Thus, owing to functional characteristics of MTC, functional imaging modalities of nuclear medicine play a major role in the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for MTC. Among nuclear medicine modalities, Tc(V) -dimercaptosuccinic acid, In-octreotide and I/I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine are commonly used in the diagnostic and even more in postoperative work-up of MTC. Alternatively, F-fluorodeoxyglucose and other positron emission tomography radiopharmaceuticals such as F-fluorodopa or F-fluorodopamine as well as radiolabelled antibodies such as Tc/I/I anticarcinoembryonic antigen, antigastrin, and anticholecystokinin-B have promising results. Functional imaging has a great advantage for nuclear medicine techniques in the routine work-up of MTC patients and also has a wide use in experimental studies.",

Novel targeted therapies aimed at the inhibition of the mutated oncoprotein BRAF(V600E) have shown promise in vivo and in vitro but do not result in cellular apoptosis. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis in a tumor-selective manner by activating the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Here, we show that a TRAIL-R2 agonist antibody, lexatumumab, induces apoptosis effectively in some thyroid cancer cell lines (HTh-7, TPC-1 and BCPAP), while more aggressive anaplastic cell lines (8505c and SW1736) show resistance. Treatment of the most resistant cell line, 8505c, using lexatumumab in combination with the BRAF(V600E) inhibitor, PLX4720, and the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, (triple-drug combination) sensitizes the cells by triggering both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in vitro as well as 8505c orthotopic thyroid tumors in vivo. A decrease in anti-apoptotic proteins, pAkt, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and c-FLIP, coupled with an increase in the activator proteins, Bax and Bim, results in an increase in the Bax to Bcl-xL ratio that appears to be critical for sensitization and subsequent apoptosis of these resistant cells. Our results suggest that targeting the death receptor pathway in thyroid cancer can be a promising strategy for inducing apoptosis in thyroid cancer cells, although combination with other kinase inhibitors may be needed in some of the more aggressive tumors initially resistant to apoptosis.

To clarify this phenomenon, we analysed BRAF V600E mutation in 20 cases of anaplastic carcinoma and 13 accompanying differentiated carcinomas. Among twenty cases of anaplastic carcinomas, nine and four accompanied papillary and follicular carcinomas, respectively. BRAF V600E mutation was found in four (20%) cases.

All three papillary carcinomas accompanied by anaplastic carcinoma with a BRAF V600E mutation were also shown to have a BRAF V600E mutation. In summary, BRAF V600E mutation was occasionally observed in anaplastic carcinomas with papillary carcinoma, and the low frequency of BRAF V600E mutation in anaplastic carcinoma was thought to be due to the low frequency of anaplastic carcinomas with papillary carcinoma. These findings raise a question about the classical model of anaplastic transformation and suggest some roles of thyroid cancer stem cells in the generation of anaplastic carcinoma.",

Furthermore, the specific subgroup patterns of the PTC transcriptome remodeled by BRAF mutations were also analyzed.;A total of 188 lncRNAs and 505 mRNAs were differentially expressed in 50% or more of the PTC tissues (fold change >2; p < 0.05) as assessed by RNA-sequencing compared with paired normal adjacent tissues. Forty-seven lncRNAs and 39 mRNAs were verified in 31 pairs of PTC specimens using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the results were consistent with the RNA sequencing data. The lncRNAs NONHSAT076747 and NONHSAT122730 were associated with lymph node metastasis, and NONHSAG051968 expression was negatively correlated with tumor size. A co-expression network between differentially expressed lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs was constructed and analyzed, and functional analysis suggested that the differentially expressed genes mainly participate in ECM-receptor interactions and the focal adhesion pathway.

We report the detection of a novel BRAF triplet deletion in a case of PTC displaying a predominantly solid growth pattern. The deletion leads to the replacement of a valine and a lysine by a glutamate in the BRAF activation segment (BRAF(VK600-1E)), thus mimicking partially the 2 BRAF mutations previously described.

We and others have recently demonstrated that c-SRC is a key mediator of growth, invasion, and metastasis, and therefore represents a promising therapeutic target in thyroid cancer. However, clinically, Src inhibitor efficacy has been limited, and therefore further insights are needed to define resistance mechanisms and determine rational combination therapies. We have generated four thyroid cancer cell lines with a greater than 30-fold increase in acquired resistance to the Src inhibitor dasatinib. Upon acquisition of dasatinib resistance, the two RAS-mutant cell lines acquired the c-SRC gatekeeper mutation (T341M), whereas the two BRAF-mutant cell lines did not. Accordingly, Src signaling was refractory to dasatinib treatment in the RAS-mutant dasatinib-resistant cell lines. Interestingly, activation of the MAPK pathway was increased in all four of the dasatinib-resistant cell lines, likely due to B-Raf and c-Raf dimerization. Furthermore, MAP2K1/MAP2K2 (MEK1/2) inhibition restored sensitivity in all four of the dasatinib-resistant cell lines, and overcame acquired resistance to dasatinib in the RAS-mutant Cal62 cell line, in vivo Together, these studies demonstrate that acquisition of the c-SRC gatekeeper mutation and MAPK pathway signaling play important roles in promoting resistance to the Src inhibitor dasatinib. We further demonstrate that up-front combined inhibition with dasatinib and MEK1/2 or ERK1/2 inhibitors drives synergistic inhibition of growth and induction of apoptosis, indicating that combined inhibition may overcome mechanisms of survival in response to single-agent inhibition.

PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10) functions as a tumour suppressor by opposing the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signalling pathway. Despite correlative data, how deregulated PTEN signalling leads to thyroid carcinogenesis is not known. Mice harbouring a dominant-negative mutant thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRbeta(PV/PV) mice) spontaneously develop follicular thyroid carcinoma and distant metastases similar to human cancer. To elucidate the role of PTEN in thyroid carcinogenesis, we generated TRbeta(PV/PV) mice haploinsufficient for Pten (TRbeta(PV/PV)Pten(+/-) mouse). PTEN deficiency accelerated the progression of thyroid tumour and increased the occurrence of metastasis spread to the lung in TRbeta(PV/PV)Pten(+/-) mice, thereby significantly reducing their survival as compared with TRbeta(PV/PV)Pten(+/+) mice. AKT activation was further increased by two-fold in TRbeta(PV/PV)Pten(+/-) mice thyroids, leading to increased activity of the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-p70S6K signalling and decreased activity of the forkhead family member FOXO3a. Consistently, cyclin D1 expression was increased. Apoptosis was decreased as indicated by increased expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and decreased caspase-3 activity in the thyroids of TRbeta(PV/PV)Pten(+/-) mice. Our results indicate that PTEN deficiency resulted in increased cell proliferation and survival in the thyroids of TRbeta(PV/PV)Pten(+/-) mice. Altogether, our study provides direct evidence to indicate that in vivo, PTEN is a critical regulator in the follicular thyroid cancer progression and invasiveness.",

A total of 244 consecutive patients with papillary thyroid cancer, without clinical and ultrasound nodal metastases (cN0), were evaluated out of 1373 patients operated for a thyroid disease at the Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Milan, Italy from 1994 to 2006. Of these 244 patients, 126 (Group A) underwent thyroidectomy with central neck dissection, while 118 (Group B) underwent thyroidectomy alone. Demographic, clinical and pathological features were analysed. Overall recurrence rate was 6.3% (8/126) in Group A and 7.7% (9/118) in Group B, with a mean follow-up of 47 (Group A) and 64 (Group B) months. In Group A patients, 47% were pN1a and all patients with recurrence had nodal involvement (p = 0.002). Survival rate did not differ in the two groups. Nine patients were lost to follow-up. Group A patients were older and their tumours were larger in size; according to the pT distribution, a higher extra-capsular invasion rate was observed. The two groups were equivalent as far as concerns histological high risk variants and multifocality. Nodal metastases correlated with stage: pT1-2 vs. pT3-T4a, p = 0.0036. A lower risk of nodal metastases was related to thyroiditis (p = 0.0034). In conclusion, central neck metastases were predictive of recurrence without influencing prognosis. From data obtained, possible greatest efficacy of central neck dissection in pT3-4 papillary thyroid cancer without thyroiditis is suggested.",

In this review we address both the clinical potential of molecular biomarkers and their usefulness, based on the most recent literature.

The BRAF mutation is the most common mutation in papillary thyroid cancer and has recently been reported to be associated with disease aggressiveness; it is also an independent predictor of tumor behavior. Combined testing of RET/PTC, NTRK, RAS and PAX8-PPARgamma, which are mutually exclusive mutations, helps improve the accuracy of fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Gene-expression profiling studies have identified a variety of potential molecular markers to help distinguish benign from malignant thyroid neoplasms. Expression analysis of differentially expressed microRNAs also appears to be a promising diagnostic approach for distinguishing benign from malignant thyroid neoplasm.

Since much enthusiasm surrounds the BRAF-oncogene as a molecular prognostic factor, a central focus of our consideration is to weigh the current arguments for and against applying BRAF mutation status of the tumor in clinical practice. The frequency of BRAF mutation in PTC is high-45% on average, with values over 70-80% in some populations. This will mean that implementing BRAF mutation as a factor of poor prognosis will shift many PTC patients, considered up to now as low risk ones, to the more extensive treatment. We estimate that 31% of all PTC patients and 39% of those diagnosed with stage I-II disease will face the risk of overtreatment if the decision will be based on the BRAF-positivity of their tumors. Also, the risk of undertreatment in the young patients with BRAF-negative tumors is evaluated with 26%. We think that, as of now, the evidence-based support for such consequences is still weak. Thus, there is urgent need to look for genes or gene signatures which will be helpful in the stratification of BRAF-positive tumors to specify these with poor prognosis with higher accuracy, needed for clinical decisions. Considering this, in the review we summarize the present status of knowledge on other prognosis-related gene expression changes in papillary and follicular cancer and relate them to he tumor's biology.",

TT or TT-raf cells were treated with control or 1 microM estradiol. After 48 hours, the cells were analyzed for levels of hASH1 and chromogranin A by Western blotting and for calcitonin production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.;Activation of raf-1 in the TT-raf cells resulted in high levels of phosphorylated MEK and ERK1/2, a morphologic transdifferentiation, and a decrease in chromogranin A and calcitonin levels that are associated with a reduction in hASH1 production. Furthermore, using MEK inhibitors, we demonstrated that these raf-1-mediated changes are dependent on MEK but not ERK1/2 activation.;hASH1 down-regulation by raf-1 in MTC cells is associated with a significant decrease in hormone production.

It has a very slow growth rate and, although it metastasizes at a relatively high frequency, it has very high survival rates. Whereas the prevalence of nodular thyroid disease worldwide is high, malignant conversion from benign thyroid nodules is rare. Treatment of thyroid cancer is usually successful, but we still do not have effective therapies for patients with invasive or metastatic thyroid cancer if the disease does not concentrate radioiodine and it is not surgically resectable. On the other hand, from the same thyroid cell, one of the most aggressive human tumours can arise--undifferentiated or anaplastic thyroid carcinoma--leading to death in a few months. What features of this malignancy account for such paradoxical behaviour? The most common type of thyroid cancer--papillary thyroid carcinoma--stands out among solid tumours because many of the tumour-initiating events have been identified. All of them function in a single pathway--the RTK/RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway--and obey an 'exclusivity principle': one and only one component of the pathway is mutated in a single tumour. This highlights the requirement of this signal transduction pathway for the transformation to thyroid cancer and paves the way to targeted therapies against a tumour with a mutation in a known gene or any gene upstream of the target. However, it is also interesting to underscore the differences among the tumours arising from the different mutations. Studies in vitro and in vivo, including genomic profiling and genetically engineered mouse models, have clearly shown that each oncoprotein exerts its own oncogenic drive, conferring a distinct biological behaviour on thyroid tumours. In this review, we attempt to summarise the most recent advances in thyroid follicular cell-derived cancers research and their potential clinical impact that may change the management of thyroid cancer in the near future.",

High BRAF mRNA levels were associated with bilateral and multifocal lesions, and BRAF-pseudogene mRNA levels were positively correlated with BRAF mRNA levels (r = 0.415, p = 0.009).;These results do not support the use of the BRAF(V600E) mutation as a prognostic marker of conventional PTC. However, the association of high BRAF mRNA levels with more advanced clinical features suggests that BRAF mRNA levels might be a more useful clinical marker of PTCs, independent of the BRAF(V600E) mutation status. The correlation between BRAF-pseudogene mRNA levels and BRAF mRNA levels in PTCs is in agreement with the hypothesis that the BRAF pseudogene regulates BRAF expression during tumorigenesis by acting as competitive noncoding RNA. However, additional studies with larger sample sizes are required to confirm these findings.",

BRAF mRNA expression was significantly higher in malignant (198.2±373.9 AU) than in benign (4.1±6.9 AU) nodules (p<0.0001). BRAF expression identified malignancy with a sensitivity of 80.6%, specificity of 77.1%, positive predictive value of 75.8%, and negative predictive value of 81.8%. A cut-point of 4.712, identified by the ROC curve, was able to sort out malignant nodules with an accuracy of 78.8%.

All patients were tested for the BRAF(V600E) mutation and assigned to 1 of 2 groups: BRAF(V600E) mutated and BRAF-WT. (18)F-FDG uptake of tumor tissue was quantified by maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the hottest malignant lesion in 6 prespecified body regions (thyroid bed, lymph nodes, lung, bone, soft tissue, and other). When there were multiple lesions in 1 of the prespecified body regions, only the 1 with the highest (18)F-FDG uptake was analyzed.;In the DTC cohort, 24 tumors harbored a BRAF(V600E) mutation, whereas 24 tumors were BRAF-WT. (18)F-FDG uptake of BRAF(V600E)-positive lesions (median SUVmax, 6.3; n = 53) was significantly higher than that of BRAF-WT lesions (n = 39; median SUVmax, 4.7; P = 0.019). In the PDTC group, only 5 tumors were BRAF(V600E)-positive, and their (18)F-FDG uptake was not significantly different from the BRAF-WT tumors. There was also no significant difference between the SUVmax of all DTCs and PDTCs, regardless of BRAF mutational status (P = 0.90).;These data suggest that BRAF(V600E)-mutated DTCs are significantly more (18)F-FDG-avid than BRAF-WT tumors.

A small percentage of such patients, however, do not undergo remission and need new therapeutic approaches. Both anaplastic and medullary thyroid carcinomas exhibit aggressive behavior and are usually resistant to current therapeutic modalities. Thyroid carcinoma represents a fascinating model and a particularly promising paradigm for targeted therapy because some of the key oncogenic events are activating mutations of genes coding for tyrosine kinases, and these occur early in cancer development. A prototype is the RET proto-oncogene, a receptor tyrosine kinase, which is a key regulator of development and a 'hotspot' for oncogenic mutations. Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene have been identified as causative for papillary carcinoma and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma, making it an attractive target for selective inhibition in these subtypes. ZD 6474 has shown promising activity in preclinical models against RET kinase, and its contemporary inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor pathways renders it a very attractive drug for clinical trials in thyroid cancer. Activating point mutation of B-RAF can occur early in the development of papillary carcinoma. Moreover, papillary carcinomas with these mutations have more aggressive properties and are diagnosed more often at an advanced stage. Clinical evaluation of B-RAF-targeting drugs is undergoing and trials in thyroid cancer are planned. Agents that restore radioiodine uptake, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors and retinoids, represent another exciting field in new drug development in thyroid cancer.",

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is frequently used as a diagnostic tool for risk stratification of thyroid nodules. Therefore, the authors evaluated the performance of immunostaining with the anti-BRAF antibody VE1 on FNA direct smears.;The authors identified 51 FNA specimens that had subsequent surgical resection specimens with a diagnosis of PTC. BRAF VE1 IHC was performed on the surgical specimens to determine their mutation status. The corresponding direct smears were then stained using the same VE1 stain to assess correlation.;Twenty-two of the 46 included surgical specimens were positive for BRAF mutations (47.8%) by IHC, consistent with the published rates. The paired cytologic smears from these cases revealed 65.3% concordance. The overall sensitivity of BRAF staining on cytologic smears was 63.6%, and the specificity was 58.3%. Concordance rates were highest in specimens that were diagnosed as malignant or suspicious for malignancy (75% and 85.7%, respectively). The negative predictive value increased to 77.8% when suspicious for follicular neoplasm/suspicious cases were combined.;Specimens that were malignant or suspicious on FNA were most likely to be BRAF concordant.

The clinical challenge is to preoperatively identify those tumors that are more likely to recur.;To improve risk stratification and patient management, we sought to determine the prognostic value of BRAF V600E, NRAS or RET/PTC mutations in patients with PTC measuring <20  mm, mainly microPTC.;The prevalence of RET/PTC fusion genes was examined by quantitative RT-PCR. BRAF V600E and NRAS Q61 mutations were determined by PCR sequencing.

ATC behaves in a highly aggressive manner, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality.

Although ATC has been relatively chemo resistant, newer agents such like taxotere show promise. The role of surgery in the treatment of ATC continues to evolve, presently it should be reserved for patients who have shown an initial response to multimodality therapy and in patients in whom a complete macroscopic resection can be achieved with minimal morbidity. The successful treatment of TL currently lies in accurately diagnosing the histological subtype. Both large B-cell and mixed lymphomas are best treated with multimodality therapy consisting of CHOP combined with hyper-fractioned RT. MALT lymphomas with there more indolent course may be amenable to single modality RT or total thyroidectomy if diagnosed at an early stage IE.;Although both ATC and TL are rare, it is important for surgeons to be aware of the need for multimodality therapy when treating these patients and to understand the limited role surgery plays in diagnosis and treatment.",

Studies on the association between thyroid hemiagenesis, Graves' disease and differentiated thyroid cancer are rare.;We describe the medical and surgical history of a patient in whom a molecular evaluation was performed. A 36-year-old man presented with symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism of a few months' duration. Hyperthyroidism was confirmed biochemically and anti-TSH-receptor antibodies were positive. Thyroid ultrasonography showed no left lobe and demonstrated a diffused enlargement of the right lobe; an ipoechoic, non-homogenous nodule 15 millimeters in size was identified in the middle part of the lobe. A 99mTc-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy (111 MBq) confirmed thyroid hemiagenesis due to the absence of the left lobe. Treatment with methimazole (30 mg/day) was started. As the patient's hyperthyroidism improved, he underwent fine-needle needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the right nodule. Cytology was suspicious for malignancy (THY4) and the patient was referred for surgery. Histopathological findings revealed a papillary thyroid carcinoma. The molecular analysis did not show PAX8 or TSHR mutations in the thyroid tissue nor mutations of BRAF, H-RAS, N-RAS or K-RAS genes in the tumor.;Though thus far studies on the association of thyroid hemiagenesis, Graves' disease and differentiated thyroid cancer are extremely rare, the possibility of the development of thyroid cancer must be taken into account in patients affected by thyroid hemiagenesis and the nodular variant of Graves' disease.",

Despite the vast majority of them are of benign origin, the incidence of thyroid cancer is currently rather rising. Although there are several risk factors of thyroid cancer and several clinical, ultrasound, biochemical and molecular diagnostic markers, the exact mechanisms of thyroid oncogenesis and the linkage between thyroid nodule ultrasound appearance and its biological character remain unclear. While ionizing radiation is the only one well-known risk factor for thyroid cancer, the significance of some others remains unclear. The aim of our review was to discuss some not completely known pathophysiological mechanisms involved in thyroid oncogenesis as hypothyroidism, mutations of genes regulating cell proliferation, thyroid autoimmunity and pregnancy and to describe pathophysiological background of some ultrasound markers of thyroid cancer (size, echogenicity, vascularization, calcifications and stiffness). Better knowledge in this field is crucial for development of novel diagnostic techniques and therapeutic approaches. For example, the analysis of BRAF, RAS and other mutations in cytological samples may help to distinction between follicular thyroid carcinoma and follicular thyroid adenoma and may significantly decrease the number of unnecessary surgery among patients with thyroid nodules. Alternatively, the different malign cells growth, angiogenesis, destructions of thyroid follicles, reparative changes, growth retardation, fibrosis and increased interstitial fluid pressure implicate the typical ultrasound appearance of papillary thyroid cancer (hypoechogenicity, irregular vascularization, microcalcifications, stiffness) which is essential to catch the suspicious nodules on the basis of their ultrasound appearance among large amount of benign nodules.

Thus activating mutations of the tyrosine receptor kinases RET and NTRK, and of the intracellular signaling effectors RAS and BRAF are present in a mutually exclusive fashion in more than 70% of cases.

Three ATCs harbored the common BRAF mutation V600E. Using array-comparative genomic hybridisation (array-CGH), several distinct recurrent copy number alterations were revealed including gains in 16p11.2, 20q11.2, and 20q13.12. Subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed recurrent locus gain of UBCH10 in 20q13.12 and Cyclin D1 (CCND1) in 11q13. The detection of a homozygous loss encompassing the CDKN2A locus in 9p21.3 motivated the examination of p16 protein expression, which was undetectable in 24/27 ATCs (89%). Based on the frequent gain in 11q13 (41%; n=11), the role of CCND1 was further investigated. Expression of cyclin D1 protein was observed at varying levels in 18/27 ATCs (67%). The effect of CCND1 on thyroid cell proliferation was assessed in vitro in ATC cells by means of siRNA and in thyroid cells after CCND1 transfection.

In this study, we hypothesized that the common BRAF V600E mutation was associated with GLUT1 overexpression and proliferation in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs).;A total of 57 cases of paraffin-embedded PTC (31 BRAF V600E, 26 wild-type BRAF) were investigated using immunohistochemistry with antibodies against GLUT1 and Ki-67 (MK167) protein. The BRAF V600E mutations were detected using direct sequencing of genomic DNA that was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. GLUT1 expression was assessed using the Remmele immunoreactive score and subdivided into three groups (I=negative, II=weakly positive, and III=positive). The Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) was determined by counting Ki-67-positive nuclei.;GLUT1 expression was found in 39/57 (68.4%) samples of PTC. The occurrence of the BRAF V600E genetic variant was significantly correlated with GLUT1 overexpression (p=0.007) and showed a trend toward higher proliferation, which was indicated by Ki-67 LI (p=0.06). Moreover, GLUT1 overexpression was positively associated with Ki-67 labeling (p=0.023).;The V600E BRAF mutation in PTC may contribute to the initiation of the glycolytic phenotype and confers growth advantages in cancer cells.

A total of 51 PTC with no HT, 28 PTC with HT and 27 HT with no PTC were evaluated using DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded specimens. BRAF mutations were analyzed by direct DNA sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified exon 15. The BRAF missense mutation at codon 599 (T1796A) was present in 46 of 51 PTC (90%) with no HT, 18 of 28 PTC (64%) with HT, four of 28 HT (14%) with PTC, and zero of 27 HT with no PTC. The BRAF mutation at codon 600 (A1798G) was not detected in any case. Clinicopathological examination of 106 patients with either PTC or HT showed that the BRAF mutation was significantly correlated with patient age. These data indicate that the BRAF mutation is associated with a valuable biological property of PTC and may participate in the pathogenesis of PTC arising in HT. These results indicate that the detection of the BRAF mutation in HT can be helpful for prediction of progress to PTC.",

Tumor visualization correlated with rapid tumor growth and large tumor volume as judged from calcitonin levels. The 111In concentration ratio between tumor (T) and blood (B) in surgically excised lymph node metastases of MTC showed a large variation, with low values for microscopic and high values for macroscopic metastases in individual patients. Three cases of MTC, Hürthle cell adenoma and papillary thyroid cancer are reported with preoperative scintigraphy, T/B ratios and Northern analyses of the surgical biopsies. Visualization of tumors was possible in the absence of sstr2 (the high affinity receptor for octreotide) with the exception of microscopic tumor growth. T/B values in the patient with Hürthle cell adenoma were similar to those found in the contralateral thyroid lobe with goitre. The relatively high uptake of 111In in benign thyroid conditions probably limits the use of octreotide scintigraphy in the diagnosis of primary tumors. The technique has certain advantages over radioiodine scintigraphy after the surgical treatment of thyroid tumors: no need for withdrawal of thyroxin substitution; a possibility to diagnose metastases of tumors that do not concentrate radioiodine (MTC, Hürthle cell cancer); and complementary information about metastatic sites of non-medullary thyroid cancer (papillary and follicular tumors).",

Screening of the RAS gene allowed identification of oncogenic mutations in 1/3 (33.3%) FA and 3/4 (75%) FTC. None of the PTCs was positive for RAS.;These data indicate that BRAF mutations are the most frequent genetic event in PTC and that RAS mutations, besides being a genetic hallmark of follicular tumours, are rare or completely absent in PTC from our area.

However, it is controversial whether discrete nodules of PTC arise independently (multicentric occurrence) or are seeded from a single tumor via lymphatic channels (intraglandular metastasis). In order to determine the clonal origin of multiple PTCs, we examined X-chromosome inactivation patterns using a human androgen receptor gene-based assay (HUMARA) and the BRAF mutation using allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) in 32 microdissected cancerous tissues from 14 Japanese women with multifocal PTC. All tumor foci were greater than 3 mm in size and met the criteria for microscopic classical PTC. Samples from 13 of the 14 patients were informative based on HUMARA. Tumor foci from two cases (15.4%) displayed a discordant X-chromosome inactivation pattern. Foci from the other 11 cases (84.6%) showed a concordant inactivation pattern of the X-chromosome. AS-PCR indicated that BRAF mutational status between the tumor foci was discordant in three (25%) and concordant in nine (75%) of 12 available cases. When the results of these two molecular analyses were combined, 28.6% of the cases were discordant in X-chromosome inactivation pattern and/or BRAF mutation, suggesting multicentric origin. Some of the remaining concordant cases also may be of multicentric origin. These results support a hypothesis that multicentric occurrence in multiple PTCs may be common, possibly greater than 30%. Although the exact mechanism of multicentric occurrence is still unclear, our findings contribute to the understanding the histogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.",

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of thyroid cancer in patients with acromegaly and to investigate the frequency of the BRAFV600E mutation in PTC patients with and without acromegaly.;We conducted a retrospective study of 60 patients with acromegaly. Thyroid ultrasonography (US) and US-guided fine needle aspiration were performed on nodules with sonographic features of malignancy. We selected 16 patients with non-acromegalic PTC as a control group. The BRAFV600E mutation was analyzed in paraffin-embedded surgical specimens of PTC by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and tumor specimens from patients with PTC were stained immunohistochemically with an antibody against insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor β (IGF-1Rβ).;Thyroid cancer was found in 15 (25.0%) patients. No differences in age, sex, initial growth hormone (GH) and IGF-1 percentage of the upper limit of normal values or treatment modalities were observed between patients with and without PTC. Acromegaly was active in 12 of 15 patients at the time of PTC diagnosis; uncontrolled acromegaly had a significantly higher frequency in the PTC group (60%) than in the non-PTC group (28.9%) (p = 0.030). The BRAFV600E mutation was present in only 9.1% (1/11) of PTC patients with acromegaly, although 62.5% (10/16) of control patients with PTC had the mutation (p = 0.007). IGF-1Rβ immunostaining showed moderate-to-strong staining in all malignant PTC cells in patients with and without acromegaly. Significantly less staining for IGF-1Rβ was observed in normal adjacent thyroid tissues of PTC patients with acromegaly compared with those without (p = 0.014).;The prevalence of PTC in acromegalic patients was high (25%). An uncontrolled hyperactive GH-IGF-1 axis may play a dominant role in the development of PTC rather than the BRAFV600E mutation in patients with acromegaly.",

PTC is usually associated with a good prognosis, but there is a wide range of aggressiveness, and some patients develop distant metastasis and/or resistance to standard treatment. Early identification of these high-risk tumors is a current challenge for appropriate patient management. MUC1 expression has been studied previously in thyroid cancer, but its prognostic value remains controversial. Here, we correlated MUC1 expression in PTC with clinical and pathological features and with the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation.;We performed a clinical and morphological analysis of 190 thyroid tumors (95 PTCs and 95 adenomas). MUC1 immunohistochemistry was carried out on a tissue microarray using different antibodies. The presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation was investigated by pyrosequencing. MUC1 mRNA levels were assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on a subset of PTC.;MUC1 expression was observed in 49% of PTCs and was found to correlate with the presence of papillary architecture, a stromal lymphoid infiltrate, aggressive histological subtypes, extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis, nuclear pseudoinclusions, lymphovascular invasion, and the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation (p<0.0001). MUC1 was abundant in nuclear pseudoinclusions. Multivariate analysis showed a strong association of MUC1 expression with the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation and lymph node metastasis (p<0.0001). Lymph node metastasis was the most important risk factor of relapse.;Our study shows an association between MUC1 expression and the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in PTC.

The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the outcomes of clinically lymph node-negative patients with papillary thyroid cancer who underwent total thyroidectomy without a central neck dissection, in order to determine the rates of recurrence and reoperation in these patients compared with a group of patients submitted to total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection.;Two-hundred and eighty-five patients undergoing total thyroidectomy with preoperative diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer, in the absence of suspicious nodes, were divided in two groups: those who underwent a thyroidectomy only (group A; n=220) and those who also received a central neck dissection (group B; n=65).;Six cases (2.1%) of nodal recurrence were observed: 4 in group A and 2 in group B. Tumor histology was associated with risk of recurrence: Hürthle cell-variant and tall cell-variant carcinomas were associated with a high risk of recurrence. Multifocality and extrathyroidal invasion also presented a higher risk, while smaller tumors were at lower risk.;The role of prophylactic central lymph node dissection in the management of papillary thyroid cancer remains controversial. Total thyroidectomy appears to be an adequate treatment for clinically node-negative papillary thyroid cancer. Prophylactic central neck dissection could be considered for the more appropriate selection of patients for radioiodine treatment and should be reserved for high-risk patients only. No clinical or pathological factors are able to predict with any certainty the presence of nodal metastasis. In our experience, tumor size, some histological types, multifocality, and locoregional infiltration are related to an increased risk of recurrence. The potential use of molecular markers will hopefully offer a further strategy to stratify the risk of recurrence in patients with papillary thyroid cancer and allow a more tailored approach to offer prophylactic central neck dissection to patients with the greatest benefit.

The 4 assay methods used in this study were sensitive, reliable, and comparable with each other (100% of specificity and 53.5% of sensitivity). PTC harboring BRAF mutation had higher extrathyroidal invasion and/or lymph node metastasis than PTC with wild-type BRAF. BRAF mutation analysis should be useful for the clinical diagnosis of PTC in cases of indeterminate fine needle aspiration specimen, because of the high degree of specificity.

When the diameter of tumor was >10 mm, the central lymph node metastasis rate was significantly higher in patients with positive BRAF mutation than that in patients with a negative BRAF mutation (P<0.05).;The presence of BRAF mutation is an independent predictive factor for central lymph node metastasis. When PTC is with preoperative positive BRAF mutation, the cervical dissection should be routinely performed. The larger the tumor diameter is, the more important is the central lymph node dissection. There should be re-evaluated the necessity of preventative central lymph node dissection when the tumor diameter was ≤5 mm in patients with negative BRAF mutation.",

The transversion is frequently detected in the conventional type, Warthin-like and tall cell variants, but is rare in the follicular variant of PTC. Conventional PTC is often presented with tumors of mixed architecture, which besides the papillary structures also contain areas with follicular and solid morphology in which the details of BRAF mutational status are unknown. We set out to differentially investigate the presence of mutated BRAF in the individual structural components microdissected from 44 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded PTC tissues from 40 patients. The mutation was detected in at least 1 structural component in 23 tumors (52%). Different structural components of the same tumor had identical BRAF status in 41/44 tumors (93%). In 3 tumors the BRAF(T1799A) mutation was found only in the papillary, but not in the follicular component. Mutational patterns identical to those in the primary tumors were found in 11/12 lymph node metastases (92%, including both BRAF(T1799A)-positive and -negative cases). The high concordance of the BRAF mutational status in structurally distinct areas suggests a rather homogeneous distribution of neoplastic epithelial cells in a conventional PTC tumor in most cases. These results imply the reliability of preoperative molecular diagnosis of PTC regardless of the type of tumor component at the site of biopsy sampling and suggest that the majority of patients with BRAF mutation-positive PTC may benefit from the targeted pharmacotherapy.",

Tissue microarray studies can produce genetic maps and proteomics, patterns of protein expression of TTM derived from preoperative biopsies and specimens.

Follicular thyroid cancers harbor translocations and fusions of certain genes (PAX 8 and PPAR-gamma). Proteomic analysis from various tissue sources can provide useful information regarding the overall state of a thyroid cancer cell. Understanding the molecular events related to these genetic and protein alterations can potentially clarify thyroid cancer pathogenesis and guide appropriate molecular targeted therapies. However, despite the realization that these emerging technologies hold great promise, there are still significant obstacles to the routine use of TTM. These include equivocal thyroid nodule tissue morphologic interpretations, inadequate standardization of methods, and monetary costs. Interpretative shortcomings are frequently due to the relative scarcity of cellular material from fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) specimens.

Many tumor suppressor genes are aberrantly methylated in thyroid cancer, and some even in benign thyroid tumors, suggesting a role of this epigenetic event in early thyroid tumorigenesis. Methylation of some of these genes tends to occur in certain types of thyroid cancer and is related to specific signaling pathways. For example, methylation of PTEN and RASSF1A genes occurs mostly in follicular thyroid cancer, and its tumorigenic role may be related to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway, whereas methylation of genes for tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3, SLC5A8, and death-associated protein kinase occurs in papillary thyroid cancer and is related to the BRAF/MAPK kinase/MAPK pathway. Methylation of thyroid-specific genes, such as those for sodium/iodide symporter and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor, is also common in thyroid cancer. Although its tumorigenic role is not clear, methylation, and hence silencing, of these thyroid-specific genes is a cause for the failure of clinical radioiodine treatment of thyroid cancer. Unlike gene methylation, histone modifications have been relatively poorly investigated in thyroid tumors.

The mutation was BRAF V600E in 12/56 cases (21%) and BRAF K601E in 2/56 (4%). Of the BRAF mutated samples on cytological diagnosis (14/56 cases), 2/14 cases (14%) were benign on final histology and 12/14 (86%) were malignant. All BRAF-mutated cases on cytology that were found to be benign on histological examination carried the K601E mutation.

To gain insight into the biologic nature of FVPTC, we compared genetic alterations characteristic of papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas in 24 FVPTCs and 26 classic PTC (CPTCs). In FVPTCs, we observed ras mutation in 6 of 24 cases (25%), BRAF mutation in 1 of 13 cases (7.6%), and ret rearrangement in 5 of 12 cases (41.7%). In CPTCs, we found ras mutation in no case, BRAF mutation in 3 of 10 cases (30%), and ret rearrangement in 5 of 11 cases (45%). One FVPTC exhibited simultaneous ras mutation and ret/PTC1 rearrangement, and one CPTC harbored simultaneous BRAF mutation and ret/PTC3 rearrangement. Based on these findings, we concluded that ras mutation correlates with follicular differentiation of thyroid tumors whereas ret activation is associated with papillary nuclei but not with papillary architecture. ret activation is not exclusive of ras or BRAF mutation, whereas ras and BRAF mutations are mutually exclusive.

Activation of this pathway is necessary to mediate the transforming potential of oncogenic BRAF, however, it may also cause a negative feedback that inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Mitogen-inducible gene-6 (MIG-6) is a potent inhibitor of the EGFR and has been demonstrated to function as a tumor suppressor. As MIG-6 can be induced via RAS-ERK signaling, we investigated its potential involvement in this negative regulatory loop. Focus formation assays were performed and demonstrated that MIG-6 significantly reduces malignant transformation induced by oncogenic BRAF. Although this genetic interaction was mirrored by a physical interaction between MIG-6 and BRAF, we did not observe a direct regulation of BRAF kinase activity by MIG-6. Interestingly, a selective chemical EGFR inhibitor suppressed transformation to a similar degree as MIG-6, whereas combining these approaches had no synergistic effect. By analyzing a range of BRAF mutated and wildtype cell line models, we could show that BRAF V600E causes a strong upregulation of MIG-6, which was mediated at the transcriptional level via the RAS-ERK pathway and resulted in downregulation of EGFR activation. This feedback loop is operational in tumors, as shown by the analysis of almost 400 patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Presence of BRAF V600E correlated with increased MIG-6 expression on the one hand, and with inactivation of the EGFR and of PI3K/AKT signaling on the other hand. Importantly, we also observed a more aggressive disease phenotype when BRAF V600E coexisted with low MIG-6 expression. Finally, analysis of methylation data was performed and revealed that higher methylation of MIG-6 correlated to its decreased expression. Taken together, we demonstrate that MIG-6 efficiently reduces cellular transformation driven by oncogenic BRAF by orchestrating a negative feedback circuit directed towards the EGFR. ",

The sensitivity of the assays was validated in two cell lines, K1 and RO82-W-1, which were respectively positive and negative for the mutation. The method enabled detection of very low concentrations (~1%) of the mutation, with positive findings obtained in 119 of the 187 samples (63.6%). The mutation was not detected in 20 cases of benign thyroid diseases. The presence of the mutation was significantly associated with ages >45 years, the tumor-nodes-metastasis stage, region of metastasis, and clinical outcome (P < 0.05). Although no correlation was found between the mutation and lymph node metastasis, the proportions of patients carrying a mutation differed significantly between central and lateral cervical lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis also indicated the presence of mutation, tumor size, and cervical lymph node metastasis to be independent predictors for recurrence and distant metastasis. We conclude that a high proportion of PTC cases likely harbors the BRAF V600E mutation.

Recently, let-7 microRNA was found to reduce RAS levels in lung cancer, acting as a tumor suppressor gene. Here, we report that RET/PTC3 oncogenic activation in PCCL3 rat thyroid cells markedly reduces let-7f expression. Moreover, stable transfection of let-7 microRNA in TPC-1 cells, which harbor RET/PTC1 rearrangement, inhibits MAPK activation. As a result, let-7f was capable of reducing TPC-1 cell growth, and this might be explained, at least in part, by decreased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of cell cycle stimulators such as MYC and CCND1 (cyclin D1) and increased P21 cell cycle inhibitor mRNA. In addition, let-7 enhanced transcriptional expression of molecular markers of thyroid differentiation such as TITF1 and TG. Thus, reduced expression of let-7f might be an essential molecular event in RET/PTC malignant transformation. Moreover, let-7f effects on thyroid growth and differentiation might attenuate neoplastic process of RET/PTC papillary thyroid oncogenesis through impairment of MAPK signaling pathway activation. This is the first functional demonstration of an association of let-7 with thyroid cancer cell growth and differentiation.",

BRAFV600E is almost always found in PTC with a papillary or a mixed follicular/papillary architecture, being rarer in other subtypes of PTC. The discovery of the BRAFV600E mutation in tissue and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is diagnostic for PTC and has been frequently associated with worse clinical prognosis. However, some studies failed to reveal this prognostic association. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional modulation of PTC with a BRAF mutation has been evaluated in some recent studies. Current therapeutic approaches targeting BRAF are being tested in clinical trials, particularly in more aggressive PTC. In this review, we will first discuss the diagnostic value of a BRAF mutation for PTC diagnosis. The prognostic role of a BRAFV600E mutation is then outlined and discussed in the context of other well-accepted clinicopathological prognostic parameters for PTC (age, gender, pTNM stage, histological subtype).

We analyzed exon 15 of BRAF spanning the V600 locus by direct sequencing in 1,320 adult and pediatric tumors of the nervous system including various types of glial, embryonal, neuronal and glioneuronal, meningeal, adenohypophyseal/sellar, and peripheral nervous system tumors. A total of 96 BRAF mutations were detected; 93 of the V600E type and 3 cases with a three base pair insertion between codons 599 and 600. The highest frequencies of BRAF (V600E) mutations were found in WHO grade II pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (42/64; 66%) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas with anaplasia (15/23; 65%), as well as WHO grade I gangliogliomas (14/77; 18%), WHO grade III anaplastic gangliogliomas (3/6) and pilocytic astrocytomas (9/97; 9%).

Moreover MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways are greatly implicated in PTC development. Many target therapies for PTC are currently under investigation, unfortunately without the expected results. Aim of this study was to characterized the preclinical effectiveness of novel promising drugs, RAF265, SB590885 and ZSTK474 in 3 thyroid cancer cell lines (BCPAP, K1, 8505C). RAF265 and SB590885 target differentially BRAF, while ZSTK474 acts on PI3K. IC50 demonstrated high drug activities ranging from 0.1 to 6.2 μM, depending on drugs and cell type, while combination index revealed an interesting synergistic effect of combination regimen (RAF265 + ZSTK474 and SB590885 + ZSTK474) in almost all cell lines. Moreover this synergistic effect was particularly evident by Western blot, whereas dual MAPK and PI3K/Akt inhibition was detected. In addition, treating cells with SB590885 induced marked morphological changes, leading to massive vacuolization. This suggests an activation of apoptotic process, as underlined by Annexin V flow cytometry analysis. Also cell cycle was altered in treated cells, without evidence of a common pattern, but rather with a more specific effect relying on single drug or combination regimen used. Since beneficial effects of in vitro combination regimen (RAF265 + ZSTK474 and SB590885 + ZSTK474), it is recommended additional investigation.

Sanger sequencing is the 'gold standard' for mutation detection but is subject to sampling error and requires resources beyond many diagnostic pathology laboratories. In this study, we compared immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a BRAF(V600E) mutation-specific MAB to Sanger sequencing on DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, in a well-characterized cohort of 101 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients. For all cases, an IHC result was available; however, five cases failed Sanger sequencing. Of the 96 cases with molecular data, 68 (71%) were BRAF(V600E) positive by IHC and 59 (61%) were BRAF(V600E) positive by sequencing. Eleven cases were discordant. One case was negative by IHC and initially positive by sequencing. Repeat sequencing of that sample and sequencing of a macrodissected sample were negative for BRAF(V600E). Of ten cases positive by IHC but negative by sequencing on whole sections, repeat sequencing on macrodissected tissue confirmed the IHC result in seven cases (suggesting that these were false negatives of sequencing on whole sections). In three cases, repeat sequencing on recut tissue remained negative (including using massive parallel sequencing), but these cases demonstrated relatively low neoplastic cellularity. We conclude that IHC for BRAF(V600E) is more sensitive and specific than Sanger sequencing in the routine diagnostic setting and may represent the new gold standard for detection of BRAF(V600E) mutation in PTC.",

Combining the BRAF V600E molecular assays (Real-Q and AS-PCR) with cytological diagnoses of malignant and suspicious for malignant cells, the detection rates (sensitivity) of Real-Q and AS-PCR for diagnosis of PTC increased to 94.2% (95% CI, 88.4%-97.6%) and 92.6% (95% CI, 86.4%-96.5%), respectively.

Both tumors were analyzed for the BRAF (Val600Glu) mutation and the RET/PTC1 translocation. The PTC was positive for the BRAF mutation but negative for RET/PTC1.

The oncogenicity of this mutation has been shown by some genetically engineered mouse models. However, in these mice, BRAF(V600E) is expressed in all the thyroid cells from the fetal periods, and suppresses thyroid function, thereby leading to TSH elevation, which by itself promotes thyroid tumorigenesis. To overcome these problems, we exploited 2 different approaches, both of which allowed temporally and spatially restricted expression of BRAF(V600E) in the thyroid glands. First, we generated conditional transgenic mice harboring the loxP-neo(R)-loxP-BRAF(V600E)-internal ribosome entry site-green fluorescent protein sequence [Tg(LNL-BRAF(V600E))]. The double transgenic mice (LNL-BRAF(V600E);TPO-Cre) were derived from a high expressor line of Tg(LNL-BRAF(V600E)) mice and TPO-Cre mice; the latter expresses Cre DNA recombinase under the control of thyroid-specific thyroid peroxidase (TPO) promoter and developed PTC-like lesions in early life under normal serum TSH levels due to mosaic recombination. In contrast, injection of adenovirus expressing Cre under the control of another thyroid-specific thyroglobulin (Tg) promoter (Ad-TgP-Cre) into the thyroids of LNL-BRAF(V600E) mice did not induce tumor formation despite detection of BRAF(V600E) and pERK in a small fraction of thyroid cells. Second, postnatal expression of BRAF(V600E) in a small number of thyroid cells was also achieved by injecting the lentivirus expressing loxP-green fluorescent protein-loxP-BRAF(V600E) into the thyroids of TPO-Cre mice; however, no tumor development was again observed. These results suggest that BRAF(V600E) does not appear to induce PTC-like lesions when expressed in a fraction of thyroid cells postnatally under normal TSH concentrations. ",

The BRAF(V600E) mutation was analyzed by PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing. The correlation between the presence/absence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation, clinicopathological features, and outcome of PTC patients were evaluated.;The BRAF(V600E) mutation was found in 38 of 102 (37.3%) PTC patients, and was significantly more frequent in patients older than 60 yr (P = 0.02), in advanced stages (P = 0.03), and in cases with vascular invasion (P = 0.02). At univariate analysis the worst outcome for PTC patients was significantly correlated with clinicopathological features (i.e. age, tumor size, extrathyroid extension, lymph node and distant metastases, advanced stage, vascular endothelial growth factor expression, and vascular invasion) and the BRAF(V600E) mutation (P < 0.002). However, at multivariate analysis only the BRAF(V600E) mutation showed an independent correlation with the worst outcome (P = 0.03). Moreover, the survival curves of PTC patients showed a lower percentage of survivors in the BRAF(V600E)-mutated group (P = 0.015).;In this study the BRAF(V600E) mutation correlated with the worst outcome for PTC patients, who were not only at a higher risk not to be cured but also for death.

They revealed that environmental exposure to 131I during childhood carries an increased risk of thyroid cancer and the risk is radiation dose dependent. The youngest children are most sensitive to radiation-induced carcinogenesis, and the minimal latent period for thyroid cancer development after exposure is as short as 4 yr. The vast majority of these cancers are papillary carcinomas, many of which have characteristic solid or solid-follicular microscopic appearance.

Because BRAF protein plays an important role in ATC cell growth, we analyzed the effects of BAG3 down-modulation on BRAF protein levels. Furthermore, by using a proteasome inhibitor, we verified whether BAG3-mediated regulation of BRAF levels involved a proteasome-dependent mechanism.;BAG3 down-modulation significantly inhibits ATC growth in vitro and in vivo. BAG3 coimmunoprecipitates with BRAF protein, and its down-modulation results in a significant reduction of BRAF protein levels, which can be reverted by incubation with the proteasome inhibitor MG132.;BAG3 protein sustains ATC growth in vitro and in vivo.

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid cancers are the most common endocrine malignancy. Radiation exposure, family history of thyroid cancer and some inherited conditions are the most important predisposing factors for the development of thyroid cancer. Three mitogenic signalling pathways have been described in the thyroid cell, which are influenced by various stimulatory and inhibitory hormones, growth factors and neurotransmitters. Various proto-oncogenes and oncogenes like ras, braf, trk, met and RET also play a role in the signal transduction systems. Two theories have been described in thyroid cancer pathogenesis, the foetal cell carcinogenesis theory and the more common, multistep carcinogenesis theory. The multistep carcinogenesis theory is now the accepted model in many human cancers, including thyroid cancer. The early events of tumour formation are the consequence of activation of either various growth factors or the proto-oncogenes like ras, met or ret. This results in the formation of differentiated thyroid cancers like the papillary, follicular or Hurthle cell cancers. The later stages of tumour formation involve further activation of proto-oncogenes and loss or inactivation of tumour suppressor genes like p53. Based on this theory, follicular carcinomas are generated from follicular adenomas and papillary carcinomas from precursor cells generated from thyrocytes. Anaplastic carcinoma may develop from papillary or follicular carcinoma by dedifferentiation. In this review article, we highlight the molecular pathogenesis of thyroid tumours.",

Classifying both suspicious and malignant FNAB results as positive cytology results, supplementary genetic testing increased the overall sensitivity of FNAB from 70.4 to 85.7%, the positive predictive value (PPV) from 59.4 to 64.9%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) from 84.0 to 91.3%.;Supplementary mutation analysis of RET and especially of the BRAF V600E mutation in FNABs is a fast and probably cost-effective assay in routine diagnostic setting. Mutation analyses of PTC-specific genetic alterations improve the preoperative identification and prognostic assessment of thyroid malignancies and therefore enable an optimized surgical strategy.",

Analyses of 379 consecutive patients with PTC who underwent thyroidectomy with (n=243) or without CND (n=136) at a tertiary-care academic hospital during the period 2001-2010 for their clinicopathological outcomes and BRAF mutation status. Increasingly aggressive tumor characteristics were found as the extent of CND was advanced following conventional risk criteria from non-CND to limited CND to formal CND. Disease recurrence/persistence rate also sharply rose from 4.7% to 15.7% and 40.5% in these CND settings respectively (P<0.0001). CLN metastasis rate rose from 18.0 to 77.3% from limited CND to formal CND (P<0.0001). An increasing rate of BRAF mutation was also found from less to more extensive CND. A strong association of CLN metastasis and BRAF mutation with disease recurrence/persistence was revealed on Kaplan-Meier analysis and BRAF mutation strongly predicted CLN metastasis. CLN metastases found on CND are closely associated with disease recurrence/persistence of PTC, which are both strongly predicted by BRAF mutation.

Sporadic CRCs are caused by accumulation of mutations in essential genes regulating normal proliferation and differentiation of cells. The proto-oncogene BRAF encoded by the BRAF gene is involved in the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway of signal transduction during cell growth. Acquired mutations in BRAF have been found at high frequencies in adult patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma and sporadic CRC. One of the predominant hot spot point mutations is T1799A (V600E) mutation among a cohort of CRC patients from Ahvaz city, southwest Iran. The aim of this study was to estimate the frequency of V600E mutation in CRC patients from Ahvaz city, southwest Iran. We analyzed exon 15 of the BRAF gene in isolated DNA from 80 Formalin Fixed Paraffin-embedded (FFPE) CRC tumor tissues using PCR-RFLP method. Data were analyzed using SPSS statistical program. According to our results 37 out of 80 cases (46.25%) were heterozygous for the mutation while the remaining 43 cases (53.75%) had normal homozygous genotype. No homozygous mutant genotype was found. Based on our findings, the frequency of V600E mutation appears to be significantly increased among CRC patients of the studied population but there was no significant relationship between genotypes and age and sex. In conclusion, these findings might prove the effect of V600E mutation on CRC pathogenesis. However, the exact effect of the mutation in CRC progression requires further work.",

The chief consequence of these mutations is a hyperactive ERK1/2 MAPK able to promote cell proliferation, producing a critical hallmark of metastatic disease. The biochemistry of the ERK pathway is well characterized; however, how the pathway achieves different outcomes in the face of genetic aberrations of cancer and subsequent treatment with chemical inhibitors is not clear. To investigate this, we used mass spectrometry to complete a global phosphoproteomic analysis of a BRAFV600E thyroid cancer cell line (SW1736) after treatment with the mutation-selective inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) and MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244). We identified thousands of phosphorylation events orchestrated in BRAFV600E cells and performed kinase landscape analysis to identify putative kinases regulated in response to MAPK blockade. The abundance of phosphopeptides containing consensus motifs for acidophilic kinases increased after short-term inhibition with these compounds. We showed that coinhibition of the pleiotropic acidophilic protein kinase CK2 (CK2) and BRAFV600E synergistically reduced proliferation in patient-derived melanomas and thyroid cancer cells harboring the BRAF lesion. We investigated this mechanism and show a role for CK2 in controlling AKT activation that was not reliant on changes to PTEN or PDK1 phosphorylation. These findings highlight a role for CK2 blockade in potentiating the antiproliferative effects of BRAF and MEK inhibition in BRAF cancers.",

Our aim was to study the prevalence of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in acromegaly, focusing on the role of genetic events responsible for the onset of thyroid cancer.;Germline mutations in the AIP gene were assessed in all patients; BRAF and H-N-K RAS status was analyzed by direct sequencing in thyroid specimens, while immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the protein expression of AIP and AHR. A set of PTCs unrelated to acromegaly was also studied.;12 DTCs (10 papillary and 2 follicular carcinomas) were identified in a cohort of 113 acromegalic patients. No differences in GH/IGF-1 levels or disease activity emerged between patients with and without DTC, but the former were older and more often female. BRAF V600E was found in 70% of the papillary thyroid cancers; there were no RAS mutations. AIP protein expression was similar in neoplastic and normal cells, while AHR protein was expressed more in PTCs carrying BRAF mutations than in normal tissue, irrespective of acromegaly status.;The prevalence of DTC in acromegaly is around 11% and endocrinologists should bear this in mind, especially when examining elderly female patients with uninodular goiter.

        "Doc_abstract":"In BRAF(V600)-mutant tumours, most mechanisms of resistance to drugs that target the BRAF and/or MEK kinases rely on reactivation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway, on activation of the alternative, PI(3)K-AKT-mTOR, pathway (which is ERK independent) or on modulation of the caspase-dependent apoptotic cascade. All three pathways converge to regulate the formation of the eIF4F eukaryotic translation initiation complex, which binds to the 7-methylguanylate cap (m(7)G) at the 5' end of messenger RNA, thereby modulating the translation of specific mRNAs. Here we show that the persistent formation of the eIF4F complex, comprising the eIF4E cap-binding protein, the eIF4G scaffolding protein and the eIF4A RNA helicase, is associated with resistance to anti-BRAF, anti-MEK and anti-BRAF plus anti-MEK drug combinations in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, colon and thyroid cancer cell lines. Resistance to treatment and maintenance of eIF4F complex formation is associated with one of three mechanisms: reactivation of MAPK signalling, persistent ERK-independent phosphorylation of the inhibitory eIF4E-binding protein 4EBP1 or increased pro-apoptotic BCL-2-modifying factor (BMF)-dependent degradation of eIF4G. The development of an in situ method to detect the eIF4E-eIF4G interactions shows that eIF4F complex formation is decreased in tumours that respond to anti-BRAF therapy and increased in resistant metastases compared to tumours before treatment. Strikingly, inhibiting the eIF4F complex, either by blocking the eIF4E-eIF4G interaction or by targeting eIF4A, synergizes with inhibiting BRAF(V600) to kill the cancer cells. eIF4F not only appears to be an indicator of both innate and acquired resistance but also is a promising therapeutic target. Combinations of drugs targeting BRAF (and/or MEK) and eIF4F may overcome most of the resistance mechanisms arising in BRAF(V600)-mutant cancers. ",

A sensitive, specific, low-cost assay to detect these mutations is needed.;To detect BRAF V600E mutation in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, we developed a method using Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS)-PCR. This method was designed to amplify three products in a single reaction tube: a 200 bp common product serving as an amplification control, a 144 bp BRAF V600E specific product, and a 97 bp wild-type (wt) specific product. The sensitivity of this method was determined to be as low as 0.5% for the BRAF V600E allele in a wild-type background. This method was successfully validated in 72 thyroid tumors. It detected V600E mutation in 22 out of 33 (67%) of the conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 8 out of 12 (75%) of the tall-cell variant of PTC, whereas none of the 10 follicular variant of PTC showed BRAF V600E mutation. In addition, none of the 14 follicular adenomas and 3 follicular carcinomas had BRAF V600E mutation. As a comparison method, direct dideoxy sequencing found only 27 out of 30 (90%) mutations detected by ARMS-PCR method, suggesting that this ARMS-PCR method has higher sensitivity.;Our ARMS-PCR method provides a new tool for rapid detection of BRAF V600E mutation.

BRAF gene mutation analysis combined with X-chromosome inactivation was used to evaluate these tumors' clonal origins. Genomic DNA was prepared from paraffin-embedded tissues after microdissection. In total, 62 tumors yielded DNA of adequate quality. Eighteen (18/21, 85.7%) of 21 informative cases showed concordant BRAF status in tumors from both thyroid lobes, being either BRAF mutation positive (12 patients) or BRAF mutation negative (6 patients).

A large lymphocytic infiltrate might reduce the sensitivity of methods employed to detect BRAF mutation in thyroid cytology specimens. To determine whether testing for BRAF mutational status in fine needle aspirates (FNA) is reliable also in the presence of HT lymphocytic infiltration, we assessed the BRAF status by direct sequencing and pyrosequencing in a series of FNAs with and without concomitant HT lymphocytic infiltration. We also performed the same assessment by pyrosequencing in the corresponding tissue samples. Pyrosequencing demonstrated to be more sensitive than direct sequencing. The percentage of mutant BRAF(V600E) alleles was higher in FNAs than in the corresponding tissues, probably because of the lower stromal contamination in FNA than in the sections. In the presence of lymphocytic infiltration, the percentage of mutant BRAF(V600E) alleles determined by pyrosequencing was higher in FNAs than in the corresponding tissue samples (P < 0.0001), indicating a minor lymphocytic contamination in FNA. The diagnostic value of BRAF(V600E) in inconclusive FNAs was not hampered by thyroid lymphocytic infiltration.

High-resolution neck ultrasound revealed a right hypoechoic, 1.71 × 1.05 cm thyroid nodule. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy report was a Bethesda grade III.

Warthin-like variant is an uncommon and relatively unknown variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma that has been usually associated with an excellent prognosis. Interestingly, BRAF mutations have been reported to be present in up to 75% of the patients.

        "Doc_abstract":"A high prevalence of the BRAF(V600E) somatic mutation was recently reported in several series of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC). This mutation appears to be particularly prevalent in PTC with a predominantly papillary architecture. Another BRAF mutation (K601E) was detected in a follicular adenoma and in some cases of the follicular variant of PTC. The few studies on record provided controversial data on the relationship between the occurrence of BRAF mutations and clinicopathologic parameters such as gender, age and tumour staging. In an attempt to clarify such controversies we decided to enlarge our previous series to 315 tumours or tumour-like lesions diagnosed in 280 patients, including a thorough analysis of several clinicopathologic features. The BRAF(V600E) mutation was exclusively detected in PTC with a papillary or mixed follicular/papillary architecture both of the conventional type (46%) and of other histotypes, such as microcarcinoma (43%), Warthin-like PTC (75%) and oncocytic variant of PTC (55%). The BRAF(K601E) mutation was detected in four of the 54 cases of the follicular variant of PTC (7%). The mean age of patients with conventional PTC harbouring BRAF(V600E) (46.7 years) was significantly higher (P<0.0001) than that of patients with conventional PTC without BRAF(V600E) (29.5 years). The BRAF (BRAF(V600E)) mutated PTC did not exhibit signs of higher aggressiveness (size, vascular invasion, extra-thyroid extension and nodal metastasis) and were in fact less often multicentric than PTC without the mutation.",

The relationship between these parameters and the BRAF mutation are closely examined through the more recent literature. Capsular invasion seems to show the strongest correlation with the mutation and this has important correlations, thus suggesting that a more aggressive local surgery might be advisable, whereas the correlation between the mutation and lymph node involvement would be weaker, at least according to the most recent studies.;The personalization of surgical therapy, today, seems easier to achieve thanks to molecular testing. In particular, an important result could be in the short term reduction in the number of completion thyroidectomies following simple lobectomies. Also, post operative radioactivated iodine therapies should be more carefully evaluated and tailored according to BRAF status. A possible flow chart for the decision of the therapeutic approach is proposed in accordance to the results of the literature.",

The diagnostic criteria remain inconsistent, and the role of a minor TC component is unclear. Molecular diagnostic markers are not available; however, there are two potential candidates: BRAF V600E and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations. Using a novel approach, we enriched a collective with PTCs that harbored an adverse outcome, which overcame the limited statistical power of most studies. This enabled us to review 125 PTC patients, 57 of which had an adverse outcome. The proportion of TCs that constituted a poor prognosis was assessed. All of the tumors underwent sequencing for TERT promoter and BRAF V600E mutational status and were stained with an antibody to detect the BRAF V600E mutation. A 10% cutoff for TCs was significantly associated with advanced tumor stage and lymph node metastasis. Multivariate analysis showed that TCs above 10% were the only significant factor for overall, tumor-specific, and relapse-free survival. Seven percent of the cases had a TERT promoter mutation, whereas 61% demonstrated a BRAF mutation. The presence of TC was significantly associated with TERT promoter and BRAF mutations. TERT predicted highly significant tumor relapse (P<0.001). PTCs comprised of at least 10% TCs are associated with an adverse clinical outcome and should be reported accordingly. BRAF did not influence patient outcome. Nevertheless, a positive status should encourage the search for TCs. TERT promoter mutations are a strong predictor of tumor relapse, but their role as a surrogate marker for TCs is limited. ",

A drawback of our study could be the limited number of patients with nonmutated BRAF (21 of 256 [8.2%]).;Mutation in the TERT promoter, but not in BRAF, was associated with decreased survival in 19 (24.7%) p/rPTC patients who died of disease and in 38 (49.4%) p/rPTC patients who died at last contact.

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid carcinoma is the most common malignant endocrine neoplasia. Differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTCs) represent more than 90% of all thyroid carcinomas and comprise the papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma subtypes. Anaplastic thyroid carcinomas correspond to less than 1% of all thyroid tumors and can arise de novo or by dedifferentiation of a differentiated tumor. The etiology of DTCs is not fully understood. Several genetic events have been implicated in thyroid tumorigenesis. Point mutations in the BRAF or RAS genes or rearranged in transformation (RET)/papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) gene rearrangements are observed in approximately 70% of papillary cancer cases. Follicular carcinomas commonly harbor RAS mutations and paired box gene 8 (PAX8)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) rearrangements. Anaplastic carcinomas may have a wide set of genetic alterations, that include gene effectors in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and/or β-catenin signaling pathways. These distinct genetic alterations constitutively activate the MAPK, PI3K and β-catenin signaling pathways, which have been implicated in thyroid cancer development and progression. In this context, the evaluation of specific genes, as well as the knowledge of their effects on thyroid carcinogenesis may provide important information on disease presentation, prognosis and therapy, through the development of specific tyrosine kinase targets. In this review, we aimed to present an updated and comprehensive review of the recent advances in the understanding of the genetic basis of follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas, as well as the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor development and progression.",

The V600E mutation is found in the vast majority of cases and is an activating mutation, conferring transforming and immortalization potential to cells. CEP-32496 is a potent BRAF inhibitor in an in vitro binding assay for mutated BRAF(V600E) (K(d) BRAF(V600E) = 14 nmol/L) and in a mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated (ER) kinase (MEK) phosphorylation (pMEK) inhibition assay in human melanoma (A375) and colorectal cancer (Colo-205) cell lines (IC(50) = 78 and 60 nmol/L). In vitro, CEP-32496 has multikinase binding activity at other cancer targets of interest; however, it exhibits selective cellular cytotoxicity for BRAF(V600E) versus wild-type cells. CEP-32496 is orally bioavailable in multiple preclinical species (>95% in rats, dogs, and monkeys) and has single oral dose pharmacodynamic inhibition (10-55 mg/kg) of both pMEK and pERK in BRAF(V600E) colon carcinoma xenografts in nude mice. Sustained tumor stasis and regressions are observed with oral administration (30-100 mg/kg twice daily) against BRAF(V600E) melanoma and colon carcinoma xenografts, with no adverse effects. Little or no epithelial hyperplasia was observed in rodents and primates with prolonged oral administration and sustained exposure. CEP-32496 benchmarks favorably with respect to other kinase inhibitors, including RAF-265 (phase I), sorafenib, (approved), and vemurafenib (PLX4032/RG7204, approved).

Its mechanism of action involves selective inhibition of the mutated BRAF V600E kinase that leads to reduced signalling through the aberrant mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Its efficacy is restricted to melanomas carrying the BRAF V600E mutation, which is seen in approximately 50% of all melanomas. In a randomized phase III trial, it was superior to dacarbazine in first-line treatment of advanced melanoma, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 48% (95% CI 42, 45), an estimated 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.3 versus 1.6 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.26; 95% CI 0.20, 0.33; p < 0.001) and a statistically superior 12-month overall survival (OS) rate of 55% versus 43% (HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.49, 0.77]). Vemurafenib is generally well tolerated, but its use can be associated with development of cutaneous neoplasms such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and keratoacanthoma (KA). These lesions can be excised safely without the need for withholding the drug or reducing its dose. Mechanisms of resistance to vemurafenib do not involve development of secondary mutations in the BRAF kinase domain, but may be related to BRAF V600E over-amplification, bypassing mechanisms via upregulation and overexpression of other components in the MAPK signalling cascade or activation of alternative pathways with potential to enhance cell growth, proliferation and survival. Clinical trials to test the efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with immunomodulatory agents, such as ipilimumab, and MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, such as GDC-0973, in the treatment of advanced melanoma are currently underway. Also under investigation is the use of vemurafenib in other solid tumours with BRAF mutations, such as papillary thyroid cancer.",

We determined whether the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation or allelic loss of Rap1GAP related to changes in Rap1GAP protein expression. To determine the consequences of Rap1GAP loss, we targeted Rap1GAP in culture using small interfering RNA.;A highly specific Rap1GAP antibody was applied to sections of 55 human thyroid tissues. Genomic DNA was analyzed for the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation, and loss of Rap1GAP. Rap1GAP expression in rat thyroid cells was abolished using small interfering RNA.;We observed that down-regulation of Rap1GAP in benign lesions and PTCs was common. Rap1GAP expression was more severely decreased in PTCs. Loss of Rap1GAP expression was observed in multiple histological variants of PTCs. Approximately 20% of PTCs and adenomas exhibited allelic loss of Rap1GAP. Loss of Rap1GAP was not associated with the presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation. In vitro, loss of Rap1GAP was sufficient to increase Rap1 activity in thyroid cells.;These data indicate that loss of Rap1GAP is a frequent event in PTC. The more frequent and greater down-regulation of Rap1GAP in PTCs compared with adenomas suggests a role for Rap1GAP depletion in the progression of human thyroid tumors, possibly through unrestrained Rap activity.",

Among these, the recently identified BRAF(V600E) mutation has been found at high frequency in adult patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). However, the association between this mutation and radiation exposure in adult PTC is still unknown. In this study, we examined the BRAF(V600E) mutation in 64 PTCs among adult atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima, Japan, comprising 17 nonexposed (0 mGy) and 47 exposed patients who developed the carcinoma after the bombing, and assessed the association of BRAF(V600E) mutation with clinico-pathological and epidemiological variables. The median radiation dose in PTCs with the BRAF(V600E) mutation was significantly lower than that without the mutation (18.5 vs.156.9 mGy, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P=0.022). A significant difference was found in the median latency period (years elapsed from atomic bombing to diagnosis) between exposed patients with and without BRAF(V600E) mutation (29 vs. 21 yr, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P=0.014). These findings were further confirmed by logistic regression analysis with BRAF(V600E) mutation status as a dependent variable and taking into account possible interactions between the variables. We found that the log-transformed radiation dose and latency period were independently associated with the BRAF(V600E) mutation (P=0.039 and P=0.010, respectively). These results suggest that involvement of BRAF mutation in thyroid carcinogenesis in exposed people may differ from that in the nonexposed people.",

Mutational screening of the tumor revealed a number of driver mutations in oncogenes which enabled melanoma classification into a few molecular subtypes. BRAF is a key component of mitogen-activated kinase pathway; its activating mutation leads to accelerated melanoma cells proliferation, invasion and survival. Somatic mutations in BRAF were reported in various malignancies, including thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer and melanoma. Specific features of BRAF-positive tumors could have clinical implications as mutational alterations may have an impact on the biological behavior of the tumor and prognosis of the disease. In the present study, the frequency of BRAF V600E mutation was evaluated in Russian patients with melanocytic lesions, of which 41.25% were primary melanoma and 60% were melanocytic nevi. Melanoma patients with trunk localization were of younger age in the BRAF-positive group as compared with BRAF-negative patients. Immunohistochemical evaluations of Ki-67 expression, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-2, -9, were found to be equal in BRAF-positive and BRAF-negative tumors. MMP-2/MMP-9 immunoreactivity was observed in stromal and/or melanocytic cells both in melanoma and nevi patients. Besides tumor cells, MMP-9 expression was observed in lymphocytes in 27.2% of BRAF-positive and in 19.1% of BRAF-negative patients. Histopathological prognostic markers (Breslow thickness, mitotic index, ulceration, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes pattern) did not show any differences depending on BRAF V600E mutational status.

IRF5 levels were variably modulated by Interferon alpha but IRF5 only localized in the cytoplasmic compartment, thus failing to induce p21 expression as previously reported in different cell models. Furthermore, ectopic IRF5 increased both the proliferation rate and the clonogenic potential of malignant thyroid cells, protecting them from the cytotoxic effects of DNA-damaging agents. These results were directly attributable to IRF5, as demonstrated by the reduction in colony-forming ability of thyroid cancer cells after IRF5 silencing.

SHH binding to a 12-pass transmembrane receptor, Patched (PTCH), leads to freeing of Smoothened (SMO) and subsequent activation of GLI transcription factors. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of SHH, PTCH, SMO, and GLI1 in 31 follicular thyroid adenomas (FTA), 8 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC), and 51 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) by immunohistochemical staining. More than 65% of FTA, PTC, and ATC specimens stained positive for SHH, PTCH, SMO, and GLI. However, the expression of the genes encoding these four molecules did not correlate with any clinicopathologic parameters, including the age, gender, the status of BRAF gene mutation, tumor stage, local invasion, and metastasis. Three thyroid tumor cell lines (KAT-18, WRO82, and SW1736) all expressed the genes encoding these four molecules. 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine labeling and MTT cell proliferation assays revealed that cyclopamine (CP), an inhibitor of the SHH pathway, was able to inhibit the proliferation of KAT-18 and WRO82 cells more effectively than SW1736 cells. CP led to the arrest of cell cycle or apoptosis. Knockdown of SHH and GLI expression by miRNA constructs that target SHH or GLI mRNA in KAT-18 and SW1736 cells led to the inhibition of cell proliferation.

Furthermore, the role of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in the clinical outcome of pediatric TC is unknown.;The study included 55 pediatric (median age 16 years, range 9-18 years; 46 females) and 210 adult TC patients (median age 40 years, range 20-75 years; 155 females) seen during the same time period. DNA was isolated from TC tissues and subjected to direct sequencing. Genetic-clinicopathological correlations were analyzed.;Only one case of pediatric TC was found to harbor the C228T TERT promoter mutation (1.8%). The C250T mutation was not detected in any of the 55 pediatric TC. In contrast, there was a significantly higher rate of TERT promoter mutations in the adult patients (15.7%, 33/210) compared with the pediatric patients (p = 0.003). In addition, persistent/recurrent TC was seen in 8/12 (66.7%) pediatric patients harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation versus 14/41 (34.1%) patients harboring the wild type BRAF (p = 0.05), and when only conventional papillary TC was examined, in 7/9 (77.8%) cases harboring BRAF(V600E) mutation versus 11/33 (33.3%) cases harboring wild type BRAF (p = 0.025).;This is the first study on TERT promoter mutations in pediatric TC, which revealed an exceedingly low prevalence, suggesting a limited role of these mutations in pediatric TC. This study also for the first time demonstrates an association of the BRAF(V600E) mutation with TC recurrence in pediatric patients.",

We developed a two-tube multiplexed PCR assay followed by single-nucleotide primer extension assay for simultaneous detection of 50 mutations in the BRAF (p.V600E, p.K601E/Q) and RAS genes (KRAS and NRAS codons 12, 13, 19, 61 and HRAS 61) using FNA smears of thyroid nodules. Forty-two FNAs and 27 paired formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were tested. All BRAF p.V600E-positive FNA smears (five) carried a final diagnosis of PTC on resection. RAS mutations were found in benign as well as malignant lesions. Ninety-two percent concordance was observed between FNA and FFPE tissues. In conclusion, our assay is sensitive and reliable for simultaneous detection of multiple BRAF/RAS mutations in FNA smears of thyroid nodules. ",

These discoveries reduced the fraction of PTC cases with unknown oncogenic driver from 25% to 3.5%. Combined analyses of genomic variants, gene expression, and methylation demonstrated that different driver groups lead to different pathologies with distinct signaling and differentiation characteristics. Similarly, we identified distinct molecular subgroups of BRAF-mutant tumors, and multidimensional analyses highlighted a potential involvement of oncomiRs in less-differentiated subgroups. Our results propose a reclassification of thyroid cancers into molecular subtypes that better reflect their underlying signaling and differentiation properties, which has the potential to improve their pathological classification and better inform the management of the disease.

Archival formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues from 352 patients with colon adenocarcinoma (n = 279) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (n = 73) were evaluated for the BRAF V600E mutation by sequencing and IHC. The discordant cases were re-evaluated by repeat IHC, SNaPshot and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Furthermore, the effect of pre-analytical variables on the utility of this antibody was evaluated in two xenograft mouse models.After resolving 15 initially discordant cases, 212 cases were negative for the BRAF V600E mutation by IHC. Of these, 210 cases (99.1%) were also negative by sequencing and two cases (0.9%) remained discordant. Of the 140 cases that were IHC positive for BRAF V600E, 138 cases were confirmed by sequencing (98.6%) and two cases remained discordant (1.4%).

In mouse models of thyroid cancer, selective mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway antagonists increase the expression of the sodium-iodide symporter and uptake of iodine. Their effects in humans are not known.;We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness to radioiodine in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer. After stimulation with thyrotropin alfa, dosimetry with iodine-124 positron-emission tomography (PET) was performed before and 4 weeks after treatment with selumetinib (75 mg twice daily). If the second iodine-124 PET study indicated that a dose of iodine-131 of 2000 cGy or more could be delivered to the metastatic lesion or lesions, therapeutic radioiodine was administered while the patient was receiving selumetinib.;Of 24 patients screened for the study, 20 could be evaluated. The median age was 61 years (range, 44 to 77), and 11 patients were men. Nine patients had tumors with BRAF mutations, and 5 patients had tumors with mutations of NRAS. Selumetinib increased the uptake of iodine-124 in 12 of the 20 patients (4 of 9 patients with BRAF mutations and 5 of 5 patients with NRAS mutations). Eight of these 12 patients reached the dosimetry threshold for radioiodine therapy, including all 5 patients with NRAS mutations. Of the 8 patients treated with radioiodine, 5 had confirmed partial responses and 3 had stable disease; all patients had decreases in serum thyroglobulin levels (mean reduction, 89%). No toxic effects of grade 3 or higher attributable by the investigators to selumetinib were observed. One patient received a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome more than 51 weeks after radioiodine treatment, with progression to acute leukemia.;Selumetinib produces clinically meaningful increases in iodine uptake and retention in a subgroup of patients with thyroid cancer that is refractory to radioiodine; the effectiveness may be greater in patients with RAS-mutant disease.

Four groups were composed according to cytological and pathological diagnoses: Benign (B), papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), atypia of unknown significance (AUS) and follicular neoplasia (FN). The latter 2 groups were further sub-classified into 2 as benign (AUS-B and FN-B) and malignant (AUS-M and FN-M) according to final pathological diagnosis. DNAs were isolated from the fine needle aspiration cytology specimens and the methylation status of TSHr promotor region was investigated by using methylation specific polymerase chain reaction.;Overall, TSHr methylation was present in 58% of cases; 71% of malignant and 46% of benign nodules. PTC group showed the highest TSHr methylation rate (87%), followed by 61% in AUS, 44% in B, and 30% in FN (p = 0.016).

Expression of COT was compared with clinicopathological characteristics including recurrence-free survival. Datasets from public repository (NCBI) were subjected to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).qPCR data showed that the relative mRNA expression of A-, B-, C-RAF and COT of PTC were higher than normal tissues (all P < 0.01). In addition, the expression of COT mRNA in PTC showed positive correlation with A- (r = 0.4083, P < 0.001), B- (r = 0.2773, P = 0.0003), and C-RAF (r = 0.5954, P < 0.001).

Interestingly, moderate-to-strong staining intensities of B-RAF and COT were more frequent in B-RAF-positive PTC (P < 0.001, P = 0.013, respectively). In addition, aberrant expression of COT was related to old age at initial diagnosis (P = 0.045) and higher recurrence rate (P = 0.025).

To determine if PTC-associated gene expression could predict lymph node involvement, a separate cohort of 130 primary PTC (54 metastatic and 76 nonmetastatic) was investigated.

Three genes (CST6, CXCL14, and DHRS3) are strongly associated with PTC. Immunohistochemical analysis of CXCL14 confirmed the qPCR data and showed protein expression in PTC epithelial cells. We also observed that CST6, CXCL14, DHRS3, and SPP1 were associated with PTC lymph node metastasis, with CST6, CXCL14, and SPP1 being positively correlated with metastasis and DHRS3 being negatively correlated. Finally, we found a strong correlation between CST6 and CXCL14 expression and BRAF(V600E) mutational status, suggesting that these genes may be induced subsequently to BRAF activation and therefore may be downstream in the BRAF/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway.;CST6, CXCL14, DHRS3, and SPP1 may play a role in PTC pathogenesis and progression and are possible molecular targets for PTC therapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"After the pathogenesis of thyroid carcinomas was better understood and the role of molecular alterations in RET, BRAF and RET/PTC rearrangement was revealed, several trials using multikinase inhibitors were developed during the last decade for the treatment of recurrent radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), achieving a remarkable success. Sorafenib became the first drug approved for this indication in more than two decades after a significant improvement in the progression-free survival was demonstrated. Lenvatinib (E-7080), an orally active inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1, 2 and 3, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ret and mast/stem cell growth factor receptor Kit, yielded highly promising early clinical data, even when given after progression on first-line therapy. The phase III SELECT trial recently demonstrated the impressive clinical activity of the drug in RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, leading to the drug's approval by the regulatory agencies and potentially making lenvatinib the most effective drug available to date for the treatment of the disease.

Testing for BRAF mutation is clinically useful in providing prognostic prediction and facilitating accurate diagnosis of PTC in thyroid fine-needle aspirate (FNA) samples.;This study assessed the correlation of cellularity with DNA yield and compared 2 technical platforms with different sensitivities in detection of BRAF mutation in cytologic specimens. Cellularity was evaluated based on groups of 10+ cells on a ThinPrep slide: 1+ (1-5 groups), 2+ (6-10 groups), 3+ (11-20 groups), and 4+ (> 20 groups). Genomic DNA was extracted from residual materials of thyroid FNAs after cytologic diagnosis.;Approximately 49% of thyroid FNA samples had low cellularity (1-2+). DNA yield is proportionate with increased cellularity and increased nearly 4-fold from 1+ to 4+ cellularity in cytologic samples. When applied to BRAF mutational assay, using a cutoff of 6 groups of follicular cells with 10+ cells per group, 96.7% of cases yielded enough DNA for at least one testing for BRAF mutation. Five specimens (11.6%) with lower cellularity did not yield sufficient DNA for duplicate testing. Comparison of Sanger sequencing to allele-specific polymerase chain reaction methods shows the latter confers better sensitivity in detection of BRAF mutation, especially in limited cytologic specimens with a lower percentage of malignant cells.;This study demonstrates that by using 6 groups of 10+ follicular cells as a cutoff, nearly 97% of thyroid FNA samples contain enough DNA for BRAF mutational assay. Careful selection of a molecular testing system with high sensitivity facilitates the successful conduction of molecular testing in limited cytologic specimens.

To gain insight into the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma, transcriptional profiles of four normal thyroids and 51 papillary carcinomas (PCs) were generated using DNA microarrays. The tumors were genotyped for their common activating mutations: BRAF V600E point mutation, RET/PTC1 and 3 rearrangement and point mutations of KRAS, HRAS and NRAS. Principal component analysis based on the entire expression data set separated the PCs into three groups that were found to reflect tumor morphology and mutational status. By combining expression profiles with mutational status, we defined distinct expression profiles for the BRAF, RET/PTC and RAS mutation groups. Using small numbers of genes, a simple classifier was able to classify correctly the mutational status of all 40 tumors with known mutations. One tumor without a detectable mutation was predicted by the classifier to have a RET/PTC rearrangement and was shown to contain one by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Among the mutation-specific expression signatures were genes whose differential expression was a direct consequence of the mutation, as well as genes involved in a variety of biological processes including immune response and signal transduction. Expression of one mutation-specific differentially expressed gene, TPO, was validated at the protein level using immunohistochemistry and tissue arrays containing an independent set of tumors. The results demonstrate that mutational status is the primary determinant of gene expression variation within these tumors, a finding that may have clinical and diagnostic significance and predicts success for therapies designed to prevent the consequences of these mutations.",

Mutational analysis of FNAs could enhance selection of thyroid nodules for surgical removal.;Ninety-five excised PTCs along with 49 corresponding FNAs were evaluated for BRAF mutations by a newly developed assay that uses a novel primer extension method (MutectorR assay) and by direct sequencing. An additional 42 FNAs from thyroid nodules that were excised based on a suspicion of malignancy were also evaluated.;BRAF mutations were identified in 36 of the 95 (38%) excised PTCs. By histological subtype, BRAF mutations were more common in conventional PTCs than in the follicular variant (67% versus 12%; P < 0.0001; chi(2)). Analysis of the preoperative FNAs accurately reflected BRAF status of the resected PTC in 46 of the 49 paired samples (94% concordance). In FNA samples grouped according to the preoperative cytologic findings (malignant, n = 25; benign, n = 11; and indeterminate, n = 55), a BRAF mutation confirmed the diagnosis of PTC in 72% of carcinomas within the malignant group, and it established the diagnosis of PTC in 16% of carcinomas within the indeterminate group. BRAF mutations were not detected in FNAs from 32 benign thyroid lesions. Direct sequencing and the MutectorR assay yielded completely concordant results.;BRAF mutations are common in conventional PTCs, and they are specific for PTC.

The study was performed on 66 PTC patients who underwent surgical tumor resection between January and December 2012. Polymerase chain reaction-based DNA amplification was used to analyze extracted DNA from the tumor specimens in order to determine the prevalence of the BRAF (V600E) mutation. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis was employed in order to evaluate the protein expression of p53 in sections of tumor tissue. Furthermore, statistical analysis was performed in order to determine any associations among the BRAF (V600E) mutation prevalence, p53 overexpression and the clinicopathological features of PTC patients, including age, gender, tumor size, multiplicity, lymph node metastasis and extrathyroidal extension. The results revealed that the BRAF (V600E) mutation was observed in 50 (75.8%) of the 66 PTC patients and overexpression of p53 was found in 52 (78.8%) of 66 cases. No significant correlations were observed between the BRAF (V600E) mutation or p53 protein overexpression and the clinicopathological features of patients.

It has been suggested that the discrepancy may be at least partially due to the insufficient number of cases analyzed, epidemiologic factors, and a combination of different variants of PTC included in these studies.;In this context, the prevalence of the BRAF mutation in a Brazilian cohort of PTCs (n = 120) was first assessed and correlated with clinicopathologic features. The BRAF exon 15 mutation was evaluated by direct sequencing. Furthermore, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the issue of whether the expression level of the iodide-metabolizing genes (NIS and TSHR) was correlated with BRAF mutational status was investigated.;A high prevalence of the BRAF mutation was found in PTC cases (48%). The BRAF mutation was found to be significantly associated with the classic variant of PTC (66%; P < .0001), although it was found in the follicular variant as well (21%). Subtype stratification demonstrated that the BRAF V600E mutation was associated with tumor size, extrathyroid invasion, the presence of lymph node metastasis and risk of disease recurrence, and mortality in patients with the classic variant of PTC. Moreover, the expression levels of NIS and TSHR were remarkably lower in PTCs harboring the BRAF V600E mutation.;These findings provide further evidence that BRAF might be associated with a more aggressive phenotype and less differentiated state due to decreased expression of iodide-metabolizing genes. The search for a BRAF mutation in the current study population appears to be valuable for predicting prognosis and guiding management in patients with PTC.",

Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor targeting Ret and VEGFR, showed antitumor activity in preclinical studies of MTC.;In this phase II trial of sorafenib in patients with advanced MTC, the primary end point was objective response. Secondary end points included toxicity assessment and response correlation with tumor markers, functional imaging, and RET mutations. Using a two-stage design, 16 or 25 patients were to be enrolled onto arms A (hereditary) and B (sporadic). Patients received sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily.;Of 16 patients treated in arm B, one achieved partial response (PR; 6.3%; 95% CI, 0.2% to 30.2%), 14 had stable disease (SD; 87.5%; 95% CI, 61.7% to 99.5%), and one was nonevaluable. In a post hoc analysis of 10 arm B patients with progressive disease (PD) before study, one patient had PR of 21+ months, four patients had SD >or= 15 months, four patients had SD <or= 6 months, and one patient had clinical PD. Median progression-free survival was 17.9 months. Arm A was prematurely terminated because of slow accrual. Common adverse events (AEs) included diarrhea, hand-foot-skin reaction, rash, and hypertension. Although serious AEs were rare, one death was seen. Tumor markers decreased in the majority of patients, and RET mutations were detected in 10 of 12 sporadic MTCs analyzed.;Sorafenib is reasonably well tolerated, with suggestion of clinical benefit for patients with sporadic MTC. Caution should be taken because of the rare but fatal toxicity potentially associated with sorafenib.",

Recent studies preferentially search for recurrently mutated driver genes across multiple tumor samples, leading to the neglect of low-frequency mutated cancer genes. The present study was conducted to identify cancer‑driving genes in thyroid cancer with two distinct tools, OncodriveFM and Dendrix, which aim to detect neglected driver genes with low mutation frequency. A total of 23,620 somatic mutations generated by whole‑exome sequencing of 446 tumor/normal pairs of thyroid cancer were obtained from TCGA. Variant classification was conducted with Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP). OncodriveFM and Dendrix were applied to detect driver genes and pathways with statistical evidence. In addition, we analyzed DNA‑methylation status, copy number variation, expression levels and fusion genes among these driver candidates. In total, non‑synonymous mutations accounted for over 55% (13,091/23,620) of the total variants; 53 and 3 driver genes were determined by OncodriveFM and Dendrix, respectively, including 6 recurrently mutated driver genes, such as BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, EIF1AX, KRAS and 47 new genes. A total of 75 pathways with high function impact bias were identified by OncodriveFM. Two genes, FHOD3 and SRP72, were hypomethylated, overexpressed and involved in major deletions in thyroid cancer. Moreover, we identified 91 pairs of fusion genes, 89 of which were new fusion pairs in thyroid cancer. In conclusion, we successfully identified a list of new cancer genes, pathways and fusion genes, providing better insight into the tumorigenesis of thyroid cancer.",

The relative frequency of papillary thyroid cancer cases increased (from 60% up to 84.6% in the last decade) and follicular cancers decreased (from 40% down to 11.6%). During the study period, cancer size declined. Frequency of PTM (Group A) increased from 0% up to 19.3% in the last decade, but cancers of this group represent only a minority of total cancers.;The increase of thyroid cancer in this cohort was mainly due to tumors larger than 1 cm and also to smaller in size but invasive thyroid tumors.

Treated FRO cells were examined for cell cycle using flow cytometry, for apoptosis using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and for gene expression using microarray. Genes identified as upregulated were confirmed by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and proteins by Western blot analysis. SM treatment significantly decreased the proliferation of all cell lines.

The interval between NB treatment completion and PTC is usually more than 5 years. A 4-year-old, female patient with a high risk adrenal NB was found to have a 2.9-cm, right thyroid nodule on surveillance chest computed tomography (CT) 6 months after completion of her NB treatment (induction chemotherapy, tumor resection, autologous stem cell transplantation, external beam radiation to the abdominal tumor site, immunotherapy, and retinoic acid). Posttreatment surveillance included iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine scans and CT scans. Fine-needle aspiration of the thyroid nodule diagnosed a follicular neoplasm, which was negative for BRAF, NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, PAX8/PPARg, and RET/PTC mutations, without evidence of metastatic NB. Nodule histology demonstrated an encapsulated follicular variant of PTC (FVPTC). Next-generation sequence analysis for a 46 cancer-gene profile was performed on both tumors with subsequent peripheral blood DNA testing. A heterozygous missense mutation in STK11 (F354L) was identified in both the NB and FVPTC. This mutation was also detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Two additional heterozygous somatic missense mutations of uncertain significance were identified: KDR/VEGF receptor 2 (Q472H) on chromosome 4 and MET (N375S) on chromosome 7. To our knowledge, this is the shortest reported duration from completion of NB treatment to detection of thyroid cancer. The association of the STK11 gene with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, lung adenocarcinomas, and medullary thyroid cancer leads to a possible association between this genetic variant and our patient's tumors.

Both mutations are able to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling transduction pathway leading to cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. PD0325901 is a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor and therefore is a promising drug to treat thyroid cancers with either RET/PTC or BRAF mutation. In this study we tested the effects of PD0325901 on PTC cells harboring either mutation in vitro by growth curves and Western blots and in vivo using a murine orthotopic xenograft model. We found that 50% growth inhibition (GI(50)) by PD0325901 was 11 nmol/L for the PTC cells with the RET/PTC1 rearrangement and 6.3 nmol/L for PTC cells with a BRAF mutation, with both concentrations readily achievable in serum. After 1 week of oral administration of PD0325901 (20-25 mg/kg/day) in mice, no tumor growth was detected in mice inoculated with PTC cells bearing a BRAF mutation. For PTC with the RET/PTC1 rearrangement, the average tumor volume of the orthotopic tumor was reduced by 58% as compared with controls. In conclusion, our data suggested that PTC cells carrying a BRAF mutation were more sensitive to PD0325901 than were PTC cells carrying the RET/PTC1 rearrangement. Our findings support the clinical evaluation of PD0325901 for patients with PTC and potentially other carcinomas with BRAF mutations.",

Among these surgical patients, 425 (19.2%) had bilateral PTCs, and 1786 had unilateral PTCs. The patients who had unilateral PTCs were subdivided into a group with unilateral-multifocal PTCs (210 patients) and a group with solitary PTCs (1576 patients). The 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were calculated to compare the prognosis between groups. B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) mutation status was examined by direct DNA sequencing.;Patients who had bilateral PTCs were likely to have larger tumors, higher rates of extrathyroid extension and lymph node metastasis, and more advanced tumor stage than those who had unilateral-multifocal PTCs. Multivariate analysis identified only lymph node metastasis as an independent risk factor for PTC recurrence (P < .001). The 10-year DFS rate for patients with bilateral PTCs was much lower than that for those with unilateral-multifocal and solitary PTCs (78.8% vs 85.7% and 89.3%, respectively; P = .005). It is noteworthy that patients who had bilateral PTCs with lymph node metastasis had the worst prognosis in terms of DFS. Incidence of the BRAF V600E mutation (valine to glutamic acid mutation at position 600) was higher in the bilateral PTC group than that in the unilateral and unilateral-multifocal PTC groups.;The current results provide initial evidence that bilateral PTCs are more aggressive than unilateral-multifocal PTCs, and patients who have bilateral disease have more advanced stage and shorter DFS.

The effects of drug exposure on both total and phosphorylated (p-) forms of AKT and ERK were monitored by Western blotting analysis. Effects of these inhibitors on cell-cycle progression and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry and DNA-fragmentation analyses, respectively.;We observed significant toxicities to viability of cells with low concentrations of AZD6244 or GDC0941, which were synergistic when the two inhibitors were used in combination (P < 0.01). AZD6244 abrogated p-ERK and GDC0941 abrogated p-AKT levels, confirming their expected target effects. Unexpectedly, monotherapy with AZD6244 resulted in activation of the PI3K signaling pathway in some cancer cell lines and co-exposure to AZD6244 and GDC0941 was necessary to suppress both pathways. Flow cytometry showed G1 arrest. DNA fragmentation analysis showed an increased apoptosis of cells dually treated with the two inhibitors.;Concomitant suppression of MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways by AZD6244 and GDC0941 abrogates compensatory mechanisms of tumor survival and causes synergistic cytotoxicity in thyroid cancer cells.",

The BRAF(V600E) mutation was analyzed by PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct genomic sequencing. The correlation between the presence/absence of the mutation, the clinical-pathological features, and the outcome of the PTC patients was investigated.;The BRAF(V600E) mutation was present in 106 of 319 PTC patients (33.2%). Its prevalence was also the same in subgroups identified according to the level of risk. The BRAF(V600E) mutation correlated with multifocality, aggressive variant, absence, or infiltration of the tumoral capsule. BRAF(V600E)-mutated PTC also required a higher number of radioiodine courses to obtain disease-free status. The BRAF(V600E) mutation was the only prognostic factor predicting the persistence of the disease in these patients after 5 yr of follow-up.;The BRAF(V600E) mutation was demonstrated to be a poor prognostic factor for the persistence of the disease independent from other clinical-pathological features in low-risk intrathyroid PTC patients. It could be useful to search for the BRAF(V600E) mutation in the workup of low-risk PTC patients to distinguish those who require less or more aggressive treatments.

Associations between mutation types and (131) I dose and other characteristics were explored.;RET/PTC (ret proto-oncogene/papillary thyroid carcinoma) rearrangements were most common (35%), followed by BRAF (15%) and RAS (8%) point mutations. Two tumors carrying PAX8/PPARγ (paired box 8/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) rearrangement were identified. A significant negative association with (131) I dose for BRAF and RAS point mutations and a significant concave association with (131) I dose, with an inflection point at 1.6 Gy and odds ratio of 2.1, based on a linear-quadratic model for RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARγ rearrangements were found. The trends with dose were significantly different between tumors with point mutations and rearrangements. Compared with point mutations, rearrangements were associated with residence in the relatively iodine-deficient Zhytomyr region, younger age at exposure or surgery, and male sex.;These results provide the first demonstration of PAX8/PPARγ rearrangements in post-Chernobyl tumors and show different associations for point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements with (131) I dose and other factors.

The in vitro antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of sorafenib on ATC cell lines were examined. To study the in vivo effects of sorafenib on orthotopic ATC tumors in nude mice, sorafenib was given p.o. at 40 or 80 mg/kg daily. Intratumoral effects were studied using immunohistochemical analysis. The effect of sorafenib on survival of the mice was also studied. Sorafenib inhibited the in vitro proliferation of ATC cell lines. Sorafenib also significantly inhibited tumor angiogenesis via the induction of endothelial apoptosis in an orthotopic model of thyroid cancer. As result, the growth of orthotopic ATC xenografts was reduced and the survival of the test animals was improved. Sorafenib exerts significant antitumor activity in an orthotopic xenograft model of ATC via a potent antiangiogenic effect. The antiangiogenic effects of sorafenib suggest that its use in clinical setting may not depend on the BRAF mutational status of thyroid tumors.

Here, we report on the identification in a classic PTC of a novel BRAF mutation, namely a 1795GTT insertion, resulting in BRAFV599Ins, and describe its biochemical and molecular characterization. Kinase assays carried out on BRAFV599Ins and BRAFV600E revealed a three- to five-fold increase in the enzymatic activity of both mutants with respect to BRAFWT. Similarly, evaluation of BRAF-induced phosphorylation of MEK, MAPK and RSK revealed a significant MAPK cascade activation in cells expressing BRAFV599Ins or BRAFV600E, but not in cells expressing BRAFWT. Molecular dynamic simulations showed a destabilization of the inactive conformation of the enzyme in both BRAFV599Ins and BRAFV600E mutants, but not in BRAFWT. The analysis of the interaction energies inside the catalytic site allowed to demonstrate the presence of repulsive electrostatic forces acting on the activation loop and moving from inward to outward of the mutant enzymes. Finally, focus assays in NIH-3T3 cells confirmed a high transformation rate in the cells transfected either with BRAFV599Ins or BRAFV600E. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that BRAFV599Ins, as BRAFV600E, is a 'gain of function' mutation, characterized by a constitutive catalytic activation, which accounts for its causative role in the studied PTC.",

The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma brain metastases and in other cancer diseases. Therefore the BRAF V600E mutation is a highly interesting oncological target in brain tumors.;This study assesses the BRAF V600E mutation status in 969 intracranial neoplasms using a tissue microarray method and immunohistochemical staining with the mutation-specific VE-1 antibody, followed by sequencing of positively stained cases.;Out of 784 primary brain tumors seven cases with a BRAF V600E mutation were detected (7/784, 1 %). Six of these cases were neuroepithelial tumors (6/667, 1 %) encompassing 2 astrocytomas WHO grade II (2/42, 5 %), 1 gliosarcoma WHO grade IV (1/75, 1 %) and 3 glioblastomas WHO grade IV (3/312, 1 %). Interestingly, all three mutant glioblastomas showed epithelioid histopathological features. Patients with V600E mutated astrocytic tumors were significantly younger (mean age 15.3 years) than wildtype cases (58.2 years). Among three rhabdoid meningiomas, one case was mutated (1/3) while all other grade I-III meningiomas (1/116, 1 %) and all fifty vestibular schwannomas analyzed were of wildtype status. The vast majority of the BRAF V600E mutations were found in cerebral metastases of malignant melanomas and carcinomas (29/135, 22 %), with false-positive staining found in four breast cancer cases and two non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) samples.;Our data suggest routine screening for BRAF V600E mutations for glioblastomas WHO grade IV below the age of 30, especially in glioblastomas with epithelioid features and in all rhabdoid meningiomas WHO grade III. For colorectal carcinoma, thyroid cancer, malignant melanoma and gliomas BRAF V600E immunostaining is sufficient for screening purposes. We also recommend routine immunohistochemical staining followed by sequencing validation in rare CNS metastases or metastases of unknown primary. Immunohistochemical analysis using mutation-specific antibodies on tissue microarrays is a feasible, time- and cost-efficient approach to high-throughput screening for specific mutations in large tumor series but sequencing validation is necessary in unexpected cases.",

In the present clinico-pathological study of a series of 75 CPTC and FVPTC cases, we evaluated the relative contribution of the morphological features of the tumours and their BRAF and N-RAS status for the occurrence of nodal metastases. The morphological features most closely related to the occurrence of nodal metastases were extra-thyroid extension and poorly circumscribed growth pattern, in both CPTC and FVPTC. Additional features significantly associated to nodal metastases were multicentricity in the CPTC and vascular invasion in the FVPTC group. BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 29% of tumours, 41% of CPTC and 16% of FVPTC; N-RAS Q61R mutation was detected in 6% of tumours, 3% of CPTC and 10% of FVPTC.

Thus, the prognosis for patients with thyroid cancer ranges from a survival rate of >97% at 5 years, in the case of differentiated thyroid tumors sensitive to radioactive iodine, to a 4-month median survival for anaplastic tumors. The high vascularity in these tumors and the important role that oncogenic mutations may have in the RAS/RAF/MEK pathway and oncogenicity (as suggested by activating mutations and rearrangements of the RET gene) have led to the development of multitarget inhibitors in different histological subgroups of patients.

We investigated this morphological parameter in our cytological series.;We re-analyzed all 72 cytohistological samples diagnosed as positive for malignancy (favoring PTC) on fine-needle aspiration cytology from January 2012 to December 2013. We included 22 male patients and 50 female patients. The cytological cases were processed with liquid-based cytology. We performed molecular analysis and immunocytochemistry for the VE1 BRAF(V600E) antibody.;We reported 47 mutated cases and 25 wild-type (WT) cases with 100% cytohistological concordance. The cytological evaluations revealed plump cells (abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and PTC nuclei) in all 47 mutated cases, with only 6 having a focal plump cell component (≤20% cells). Furthermore, 5 of the 25 WT cases showed focal plump cells. A distinctive sickle nuclear shape was found only in the mutated cases. VE1 yielded 100% positivity for all 24 mutated cases that were tested, including 3 cases with focal plump cells.;We demonstrated that the BRAF(V600E) mutation might be predicted in cytological samples on the basis of some specific morphological features.

None of the patients (ages 6-18 years; 20 females, 8 males) had significant exposure to radiation. Nucleic acid from tumors was tested for genetic abnormalities (n = 27). Negative results were reevaluated by targeted next-generation sequencing.;Seven of 27 PTCs (26%) had neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor (NTRK) fusion oncogenes (NTRK type 3/ets variant 6 [NTRK3/ETV6], n =5; NTRK3/unknown, n = 1; and NTRK type 1/translocated promoter region, nuclear basket protein [NTRK1/TPR], n = 1), including 5 tumors that measured >2 cm and 3 that diffusely involved the entire thyroid or lobe. All 7 tumors had lymphatic invasion, and 5 had vascular invasion. Six of 27 PTCs (22%) had ret proto-oncogene (RET) fusions (RET/PTC1, n = 5; RET/PTC3, n = 1); 2 tumors measured >2 cm and diffusely involved the thyroid, and 5 had lymphatic invasion, with vascular invasion in 2. Thirteen PTCs had the B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) valine-to-glutamic acid mutation at position 600 (BRAF(V) (600E)) (13 of 27 tumors; 48%), 11 measured <2 cm, and 6 had lymphatic invasion (46%), with vascular invasion in 3. Fusion oncogene tumors, compared with BRAF(V) (600E) PTCs, were associated with large size (mean, 2.2 cm vs 1.5 cm, respectively; P = .05), solid and diffuse variants (11 of 13 vs 0 of 13 tumors, respectively; P < .001), and lymphovascular invasion (12 of 13 vs 6 of 13 tumors, respectively; P = .02); BRAF(V) (600E) PTCs were predominantly the classic variant (12 of 13 vs 1 of 13 tumors). Two tumors metastasized to the lung, and both had fusion oncogenes (NTRK1/TPR, n = 1; RET/PTC1, n = 1).;Fusion oncogene PTC presents with more extensive disease and aggressive pathology than BRAF(V) (600E) PTC in the pediatric population.

Currently, no effective therapies exist. In an effort to identify ATC-specific therapeutic targets, we analyzed global gene expression data from multiple studies to identify ATC specific dysregulated genes. <b>Methods:</b> The NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database was searched for high-throughput gene expression microarray studies from human ATC tissue along with normal thyroid and/or papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) tissue. Gene expression levels in ATC were compared to normal thyroid or PTC using seven separate comparisons, and an ATC-specific gene set common in all seven comparisons was identified. We investigated these genes for their biological functions and pathways. <b>Results:</b> There were 3 studies meeting inclusion criteria, (including 32 ATC patients, 69 PTC and 75 normal). There were 259 upregulated genes and 286 downregulated genes in ATC with at least 2-fold change in all seven comparisons. Using a 5-fold filter, 36 genes were upregulated in ATC while 40 genes were downregulated. Of the 10 top globally upregulated genes in ATC, 4/10 (MMP1, ANLN, CEP55, TFPI2) are known to play a role in ATC progression, however 6/10 (TMEM158, CXCL5, E2F7, DLGAP5, MME, ASPM) genes had not been specifically implicated in ATC. Similarly, 3/10 (SFTA3, LMO3, and C2orf40) of the most globally downregulated genes were novel in this context while 7/10 genes (SLC26A7, TG, TSHR, DUOX2, CDH1, PDE8B, FOXE1) have been previously identified in ATC. We experimentally validated a significant correlation for 7 transcription factors (KLF16, SP3, ETV6, FOXC1, SP1, EGFR1 and MAFK) with the ATC-specific genes using microarray analysis of ATC cell lines. Ontology clustering of globally altered genes revealed that \"Mitotic Cell Cycle\" is highly enriched in the globally upregulated gene set (44% of top upregulated genes, p-value < 10<sup>-30</sup>). <b>Conclusions: </b> By focusing on globally altered genes, we have identified a set of consistently altered biological processes and pathways in ATC. Our data are consistent with an important role for M-phase cell cycle genes in ATC, and may provide direction for future studies to identify novel therapeutic targets for this disease.",

The V599E mutation is highly prevalent in PTC with a papillary or mixed papillary follicular growth pattern, and the K600E mutation is apparently restricted to the follicular variant of PTC. It is usually accepted that thyroid malignancies may follow a progression path from well-differentiated to poorly differentiated (PDC) and undifferentiated (UC) carcinomas. One would expect that at least some of the less differentiated carcinomas would harbour the genetic alterations of pre-existing well-differentiated tumours. In order to find the prevalence of BRAF mutations in PDC and UC, we screened a series of 19 PDCs and 17 UCs, as well as 3 UC-derived cell lines, for both mutation types. The group of PDCs was restricted to the so-called insular and insular-like PDCs, thus excluding PTCs with solid, insular or trabecular foci of growth and PDCs displaying typical PTC nuclei. No BRAF mutations were detected in any of the 19 cases of PDC, whereas 6 of the UCs (35%) and one UC-derived cell line presented the BRAFV599E mutation. The BRAFK600E mutation was not detected in any case. We conclude that UC may progress from BRAFV599E-mutated PTC. The absence of BRAF mutations in our series of PDC supports the assumption that pure insular and insular-like PDCs are more closely related to follicular carcinoma than to PTC.",

The ongoing identification of mutations in cellular signaling pathways has revolutionized the field of thyroid cancer biology and has led to the development of novel new therapeutic agents. One of the signaling cascades implicated in the oncogenic process is the ERK pathway that normally functions to transmit mitogenic signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus. Genetic alterations of key components of this cascade, namely RET, Ras and Raf, are thought to result in constitutive activation of the pathway and subsequent thyroid tumorigenesis. Targeting of these components with pharmaceutical agents holds the potential of providing newer and more effective treatment modalities for thyroid cancer. Several such drugs are currently being developed to inhibit RET, Ras, Raf, as well as other factors impacted by the ERK pathway. These include a vast array of agents such as antisense compounds, small molecule inhibitors as well as inhibitors of farnesyl transferase, heat shock proteins, matrix metalloproteinases and histone deacetylases. Some of these drugs have already entered preclinical and clinical testing with promising anti-tumor effects.

On the other hand, the MAPK/ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway) and PI3K/Akt (lipid kinase phoshoinositid-3-kinase signaling pathway) play an important role in the transmission of cell signals. The genes, coding the signaling cascade proteins (RET, RAS, BRAF, PI3K, PTEN, AKT), are mutated or aberrantly expressed in thyroid cancer derived from follicular thyroid cells. Genetic and epigenetic alternations, concerning MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, contribute to their activation and interaction as a consequence of malignant follicular cell transformation. The understanding of this molecular mechanism provides access to novel molecular prognostic and therapeutic strategies for inhibiting the oncogenic activity of the signaling pathways. This ability to investigate tumour biology allows for the selection of different drugs. Nowadays the most relevant are treatments directed to tyrosine kinase receptors that bind for a wide variety of ligands and are frequently mutated and induce a constitutive activation such that a chimerical protein expression takes place in follicular cells in the domain of RET, as well as in other receptors. Many molecules such as: motesanib, sorafenib, vandetanib, sunitinib, XL-184, imatinib, axitinib, pazopanib, lenvatinib, combretastatin, gefitinib, cetuximab, bortezomib and thiazoldonedione have been developed. Some of them also can act in receptors of vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptors.

Furthermore, we tested the effects of two PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil) against human thyroid cancer cells. PDE5 gene and protein expression were analyzed in two different cohorts of PTCs by real-time PCR using a TaqMan micro-fluid card system and Western blot. MTT and migration assay were used to evaluate the effects of PDE5 inhibitors on proliferation and migration of TPC-1, BCPAP, and 8505C cells. In a first series of 36 PTCs, we found higher expression levels of PDE5A in tumors versus non-tumor (normal) tissues. PTCs with BRAF mutation showed higher levels of mRNA compared with those without mutation. No significant differences were detected between subgroups with low and intermediate ATA risk. Upregulation of PDE5 was also detected in tumor tissue proteins. Similar results were obtained analyzing the second cohort of 50 PTCs. Moreover, all tumor tissues with high PDE5 levels showed reduction of Thyroglobulin, TSH receptor, Thyroperoxidase, and NIS transcripts. In thyroid cancer cells in vitro, sildenafil and tadalafil determined a reduction of proliferation and cellular migration. Our findings demonstrate for the first time an overexpression of PDE5 in PTCs, and the ability of PDE5 inhibitors to block the proliferation of thyroid cancer cells in culture, therefore, suggesting that specific inhibition of PDE5 may be proposed for the treatment of these tumors.

When comparing array data with the chromosomal, mutational and clinical data we found that: a) loss of control of cellular transcription was of major relevance in this group of neoplasms, HMGA2 being one of the most overexpressed genes; b) gene expression correlated with the mutational status of PTCs, as in BRAF+ cases cMET and FN1 were concomitantly overexpressed; and c) death from disease and distant metastasis was associated to the overexpression of DDR2 and to the down-regulation of genes involved in immune, inflammatory response, signal transduction and cell adhesion processes. In conclusion we have identified in aneuploid PTCs a group of significantly altered molecules that may represent preferential targets for the development of new more efficient therapies in this type of cancer.",

Cells were incubated with IFNγ (1, 10, 100, and 1000 U/mL) alone or in combination with TNF-α (10 ng/mL) for 24 hours. CXCL8 and CXCL10 concentrations were measured in the cell supernatants.

        "Doc_abstract":"In recent years, significant progress has been made in elucidating the genetic bases promoting tumorigenesis in various human neoplasms. Constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is a major event in the carcinogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), the most prevalent endocrine malignancy. Affected elements include RET/PTC rearrangements and point mutations of the Ras and BRAF genes. Mutations in these genes are found in over 70% of PTC. Chromosomal RET rearrangements, called RET/PTC, result in constitutive ligand-independent activation of RET kinase, which was the first genetic anomaly detected in PTC and is found in 5-70% of tumoral samples. Although less frequent, the activation of other tyrosine kinase receptors, such as NTRK1, c-Met or EGFR, has also been reported in PTC. The BRAF mutation represents the most common genetic alteration found in PTC. More than 90% of BRAF mutations lead to a change of a valine to a glutamic acid at position 600 (V600E). Finally, Ras is the least affected molecule in the pathway. A relationship between clinical behavior and these genetic alterations has been proposed. Thus, the BRAF mutation is associated with a more aggressive PTC phenotype and is correlated with poorer outcomes. However, no clear association has been found between RET/PTC and clinical features. The discovery of these alterations opens the way to new therapeutic strategies, especially to treat those patients in whom conventional therapy is not effective. Several new drugs are being tested, such as small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Some of these recently developed agents have begun to be used with promising results.",

Thyroid cancer frequently exhibits activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. In other types of cancer, paradoxical ERK activation has emerged as a potential resistance mechanism to RAF-inhibiting drugs including MKIs such as sorafenib and pazopanib. We therefore queried whether the MEK inhibitor trametinib, could augment the activity of pazopanib in thyroid cancer cell lines. Trametinib potently inhibited growth in vitro (GI50 1.1-4.8 nM), whereas pazopanib had more limited in vitro activity, as anticipated (GI50 1.4-7.1 µM). We observed progressive upregulation of ERK activity with pazopanib treatment, an effect abrogated by trametinib. For xenografts (bearing either KRASG12R or BRAFV600E mutations), the combination of trametinib and pazopanib led to sustained shrinkage in tumor volume by 50% or more, compared to pre-treatment baseline. Trametinib also was highly effective as a single agent, compared to pazopanib alone. These preclinical findings support the evaluation of trametinib, alone or in combination with pazopanib or other kinase inhibitors, in thyroid cancer clinical trials. We highlight the importance of pharmacodynamic assessment of the ERK pathway for patients enrolled in trials involving MKIs. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The BRAFT1799A mutation is the most common genetic alteration in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC). It is also found in a subset of papillary microcarcinomas, consistent with a role in tumor initiation. PTCs with BRAFT1799A are often invasive and present at a more advanced stage. BRAFT1799A is found with high prevalence in tall-cell variant PTCs and in poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas arising from PTCs. To explore the role of BRAFV600E in thyroid cancer pathogenesis, we targeted its expression to thyroid cells of transgenic FVB/N mice with a bovine thyroglobulin promoter. Two Tg-BRAFV600E lines (Tg-BRAF2 and Tg-BRAF3) were propagated for detailed analysis. Tg-BRAF2 and Tg-BRAF3 mice had increased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels (>7- and approximately 2-fold, respectively). This likely resulted from decreased expression of thyroid peroxidase, sodium iodine symporter, and thyroglobulin. All lines seemed to successfully compensate for thyroid dysfunction, as serum thyroxine/triiodothyronine and somatic growth were normal. Thyroid glands of transgenic mice were markedly enlarged by 5 weeks of age. In Tg-BRAF2 mice, PTCs were present at 12 and 22 weeks in 14 of 15 and 13 of 14 animals, respectively, with 83% exhibiting tall-cell features, 83% areas of invasion, and 48% foci of poorly differentiated carcinoma. Tg-BRAF3 mice also developed PTCs, albeit with lower prevalence (3 of 12 and 4 of 9 at 12 and 22 weeks, respectively). Tg-BRAF2 mice had a 30% decrease in survival at 5 months. In summary, thyroid-specific expression of BRAFV600E induces goiter and invasive PTC, which transitions to poorly differentiated carcinomas. This closely recapitulates the phenotype of BRAF-positive PTCs in humans and supports a key role for this oncogene in its pathogenesis.",

We report a novel case where a patient with RTH presented a differentiated thyroid cancer. A19 year-old female had been referred due to thyroid disease that disclosed features characteristic of a RTH. During the follow up it was detected a follicular tumor that led to the recommendation for thyroid surgical ablation, where an incidental papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (mPTC) was found. The increase of thyroglobulin (TG) levels following thyroid removal referred the patient for radioiodine treatment. Post-treatment, it was detected jugular adenopathies and the patient was subjected to cervical lymph node drainage where metastases of the mPTC were found. RTH syndrome was confirmed by the detection of a THRB germline mutation. A BRAF mutation was also found in the mPTC but not detected in the follicular adenoma or normal adjacent tissue. The young age of the patient, the rarity of BRAF mutations in childhood and the high dissemination of the malignancy, lead us to the speculation that increased TSH stimulation in a RTH background and oncogenic activation of BRAF could have served as (co) drivers and might have triggered an advanced stage of the neoplastic disease.

Individual tumors were given an expression score (max 300) by multiplying the percent positive tumor cells by the intensity score (range 0-3). The higher expression of HBME-1 and claudin-1 distinguished BRAF-like phenotype from RAS-like phenotype. The same correlation was also retained for both markers when comparing BRAF-like phenotype with non-invasive and invasive RAS-like phenotypes. The expression scores and positivity rates for both markers did not yield any statistical difference among BRAF-like PTCs. Except the higher positivity rate of HBME-1, invasive RAS-like tumors were not statistically different than their non-invasive counterparts with respect to the positivity rate of claudin-1 and the expression scores of both markers.

It is indeed now known that BRAF and RAS mutations and RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARγ rearrangements account for the majority of molecular alterations detected in differentiated thyroid cancers. Abnormal regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is also a promising way of research. The diagnostic utility and prognostic value of detecting these molecular events has been analyzed in several recent studies. BRAF mutation analysis improves the performance of fine-needle aspiration diagnosis by increasing specificity in \"indeterminate\" cytologies and sensitivity in false negatives. Testing for a \"panel of mutations\" (BRAF, RAS, RET/PTC and PAX8/PPARγ) improves the performance, detecting papillary carcinomas with non-classic histology. The specificity of these analyzes is excellent but their sensitivity is still insufficient. In the future, specific miRNAs expression profiles in thyroid carcinoma and identification of new mutations might provide interesting information. Several studies have found that BRAF mutations are associated with a more aggressive tumor behavior, a higher risk of recurrence and treatment failure. With regard to the other mutations and rearrangements, current data are conflicting and it seems premature to draw practical conclusions applicable in routine practice. Lastly, targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, based on our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of thyroid oncogenesis, has shown promise in metastatic, progressive, and radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinomas.",

It is not clear if there is a link between EMT and CSCs in thyroid cancers. We therefore investigated the CSC properties of thyroid cancers that underwent EMT.;To induce EMT (spindle-like cell morphology, loss and acquisition of expression of an epithelial marker E-cadherin and a mesenchymal marker vimentin respectively) in an epithelial-type thyroid cancer cell line ACT-1, we used transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), BRAF(V600E), and/or Snail homolog 1 (SNAI1, also known as SNAIL). CSC properties were analyzed with assays for cell proliferation, chemosensitivity, in vitro and in vivo tumor formation ability, cell surface antigens, and intracellular aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH; a known CSC marker) activities.;EMT was induced most efficiently by SNAIL (ACT-SNAIL cells), whereas TGF-β and BRAF(V600E) were less efficient. ACT-SNAIL cells showed slightly but significantly enhanced tumor formation ability in an in vitro sphere assay (approximately 3-fold) but not an in vivo subcutaneous tumor growth assay, and showed comparable chemosensitivity compared with the parental ACT-1 cells. However, of interest, although the in vitro sphere-formation ability of ALDH(+) cells was almost unchanged after SNAIL induction, SNAIL overexpression induced much higher (approximately 14-fold) spheres in ALDH(-) cells. Thus, ALDH was no longer a CSC marker in ACT-SNAIL cells.;All these data indicate that EMT confers CSC properties in ALDH(-) cells and appears to influence the ability of ALDH to enrich CSCs.",

We report a 46-year-old man with known history of MFS who developed an unusual histological variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The tumor exhibited a widely invasive florid papillary growth pattern with prominent long villous fronds. Immunohistochemical and molecular analysis revealed a BRAF(V600E) mutation, evidence of aggressive biomarker expression (positivity for HBME-1, cytokeratin 19, galectin-3 and cyclin D1, and loss of p27), and changes associated with TGF-β-related epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition with active phospho-SMAD signaling. We introduce a unique histological pattern of papillary thyroid carcinoma that is associated with MFS. The combination of BRAF(V600E) mutation in the setting of altered TGF-β signaling and weak connective tissue integrity associated with MFS may cooperate and possibly be responsible to form this unique villous morphology with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and invasive growth.",

In contrast, the frequency of PTC cases with point mutations (mainly BRAF(V600E)) was significantly lower in patients with relatively higher radiation exposure than those with lower radiation exposure. We also found that among ABS, the frequency of PTC cases with no detectable gene alterations in RET, neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 1 (NTRK1), BRAF, or RAS was significantly higher in patients with relatively higher radiation exposure than those with lower radiation exposure. However, in ABS with PTC, the relationship between the presence of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene fused with other gene partners and radiation exposure has received little study. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the relative frequency of rearranged ALK in ABS with PTC, and with no detectable gene alterations in RET, NTRK1, BRAF, or RAS, would be greater in those having relatively higher radiation exposures.;The 105 subjects in the study were drawn from the Life Span Study cohort of ABS of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who were diagnosed with PTC between 1956 and 1993. Seventy-nine were exposed (>0 mGy), and 26 were not exposed to A-bomb radiation. In the 25 ABS with PTC, and with no detectable gene alterations in RET, NTRK1, BRAF, or RAS, we examined archival, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded PTC specimens for rearrangement of ALK using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5' RACE).;We found rearranged ALK in 10 of 19 radiation-exposed PTC cases, but none among 6 patients with PTC with no radiation exposure. In addition, solid/trabecular-like architecture in PTC was closely associated with ALK rearrangements, being observed in 6 of 10 PTC cases with ALK rearrangements versus 2 of 15 cases with no ALK rearrangements. The six radiation-exposed cases of PTC harboring both ALK rearrangements and solid/trabecular-like architecture were associated with higher radiation doses and younger ages at the time of the A-bombing and at diagnosis compared to the other 19 PTC with no detectable gene alterations.;Our findings suggest that ALK rearrangements are involved in the development of radiation-induced adult-onset PTC.",

Furthermore, small interfering RNA targeting AMPK-α1 abolished AICAR-induced activation of p38 MAPK, p21 accumulation, and activation of caspase-3.;Our findings demonstrate that AMPK activation using AICAR inhibited cell proliferation and survival by activating p38 MAPK and proapoptotic molecules in FRO thyroid cancer cells.

Total thyroidectomy was performed in 143 patients (91.1%); central compartment (CC) node dissection (level VI) in 41 patients; central plus lateral compartment (LC) node dissection (levels II, III, and IV) in 82 patients. Subtotal thyroidectomy was initially performed in 14 cases: 10 of them were re-operated because of persistence of elevated serum calcitonin levels.;After a median post-surgical follow-up of 68 months (range 2-440 months), 42.9% of patients were living disease-free, 39.8% were living with disease, 3.1% were deceased due to causes different from MTC, and 3.2% were deceased due to MTC.

At uni-variate statistical analysis (a) patient's age at initial treatment (>45 years; >/=45 years), (b) sporadic vs. hereditary MTC, (c) disease stage, and (d) the extent of surgical approach resulted as significant variables. Instead, at multivariate statistical analysis, only (a) patient's age at initial diagnosis, (b) disease stage, and (c) the extent of surgery resulted as significant and independent prognostic variables influencing survival.;The presence of lymph node and distant metastases at first diagnosis significantly worsened prognosis and survival rate in our series. Early diagnosis of MTC is very important, allowing complete surgical cure in Stages I and II patients. Due to the relatively bad prognosis of MTC, especially for disease Stages III and IV, it appears reasonable to recommend radical surgery including total thyroidectomy plus CC lymphoadenectomy as the treatment of choice, plus LC lymphoadenectomy in patients with palpable and/or ultrasound enlarged neck lymph nodes.",

Recently, clinical trials with targeted therapies have advanced the outlook of these patients, and inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) axis has led to the approval of small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for first-line treatment of radioiodine refractory disease. In addition to approved therapies (sorafenib and lenvatinib), other multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are commercially available have been recognized as viable treatment options for RAI-R DTC. Our preference is to initially use lenvatinib, given the dramatic progression-free survival (PFS) improvement versus placebo, with the caveat that 24 mg daily is not often tolerated and lower doses often used. In patients with BRAF V600E mutation, BRAF inhibitors are now considered for treatment, especially if patients are at high risk from antiangiogenic therapy. Research is continuing to evolve in identifying mechanisms related to radioiodine refractoriness, and trials are evaluating therapeutic molecules to overcome this resistance. Clinical care of patients with RAI-R DTC requires careful consideration of both patient and disease characteristics.

In this study, we examined whether PTC without BRAF(T1799A) mutation and without RET/PTC rearrangement named PTC-ga(-) were distinguishable from PTC-ga(+) (with one or the other gene alteration) on the basis of gene expression characteristics. We analyzed the mutational state of 116 PTC and we compared gene expression profiles of PTC-ga(+) and PTC-ga(-) from data of a 200 gene macroarray and quantitative PCR. Seventy five PTC were PTC-ga(+) and 41 were PTC-ga(-). Unsupervised analyses of macroarray data by hierarchical clustering led to a complete segregation of PTC-ga(+) and PTC-ga(-). In a series of 42 genes previously recognized as PTC 'marker' genes, 22 were found to be expressed at a comparable level in PTC-ga(-) and normal tissue. Thyroid-specific genes, TPO, TG, DIO1, and DIO2 were under-expressed in PTC-ga(+) but expressed at a normal level in PTC-ga(-). A few genes including DUOX1 and DUOX2 were selectively dys-regulated in PTC-ga(-). Tumor grade of PTC-ga(-) was lower than that of PTC-ga(+). There was a strong association between the mutational state and histiotype of PTC; 81% of PTC follicular variants were corresponded to PTC-ga(-), whereas 84% of PTC of classical form were PTC-ga(+). In conclusion, we show that PTC without BRAF(T1799A) mutation or RET/PTC rearrangement, mainly corresponding to follicular variants, maintain a thyroid differentiation expression level close to that of normal tissue and should be of better prognosis than PTC with one or the other gene alteration.",

Interestingly, estrogen has been shown to contribute to thyroid cancer aggressiveness in vitro, which is in full support of the observed increased incidence of thyroid cancer in women over men. Provided that estrogen has been observed to contribute to increased angiogenesis of estrogen responsive breast cancer, it is conceivable to speculate that estrogen also contributes to angiogenesis of estrogen responsive thyroid cancer.;In this study, three human thyroid cancer cells (B-CPAP, CGTH-W-1, ML-1) were treated with estrogen alone or estrogen and anti-estrogens (fulvestrant and 3,3'-diindolylmethane, a natural dietary compound) for 24 hours. The cell culture media was then added to human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVECs) and assayed for angiogenesis associated events. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were also quantified in the conditioned media so as to evaluate if it is a key player involved in these observations.;Conditioned medium from estrogen treated thyroid cancer cells enhanced phenotypical changes (proliferation, migration and tubulogenesis) of endothelial cells typically observed during angiogenesis. These phenotypic changes observed in HUVECs were determined to be modulated by estrogen induced secretion of VEGF by the cancer cells. Lastly, we show that VEGF secretion was inhibited by the anti-estrogens, fulvestrant and 3,3'-diindolylmethane, which resulted in diminished angiogenesis associated events in HUVECs.;Our data establishes estrogen as being a key regulator of VEGF secretion/expression in thyroid cells which enhances the process of angiogenesis in thyroid cancer. These findings also suggest the clinical utility of anti-estrogens as anti-angiogenic compounds to be used as a therapeutic means to treat thyroid cancer. We also observed that 3,3'-diindolylmethane is a promising naturally occurring anti-estrogen which can be used as a part of therapeutic regimen to treat thyroid cancer.",

The functions of knockdown and ectopic expression of NrCAM in thyroid cancer cells were determine by a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments.;We found that NrCAM was highly expressed in PTCs, and demonstrated that NrCAM might be a potential marker for preoperative diagnosis of PTC. Moreover, NrCAM depletion dramatically inhibited thyroid cancer cell growth, invasiveness and tumorigenic potential in nude mice. On the other hand, ectopic expression of NrCAM significantly enhanced its tumor-promoting effects. Mechanically, NrCAM exerted its oncogenic function by activating MAPK/Erk and PI3K/Akt pathways via its ectodomain shedding and binding to EGFR and α4β1 integrins. In turn, these two pathways were also responsible for NrCAM overexpression through GSK3β/β-catenin signaling axis in thyroid cancer cells. Similar results were also found in transgenic mice with thyroid-specific knock-in of oncogenic Braf",

Fifteen of 17 nodules were malignant, and 2 were benign. The benign nodules were confirmed as adenomatous hyperplasia with underlying lymphocytic thyroiditis and a fibrotic nodule with dense calcification. Thirteen of the 15 malignant nodules had 2 or more suspicious US features, and all 15 nodules were considered to have discordant cytology considering suspicious US features. Five nodules had been followed with US or US-FNA without resection, and did not show change in size or US features on follow-up US examinations.;BRAF(V600E) mutation analysis is a highly sensitive diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinomas.

        "Doc_abstract":"Diffuse sclerosing variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (DSVPTC) is an uncommon variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The aim of this review is to critically analyse the features of this entity. A search of the literature revealed 25 clinicopathological studies with in-depth analysis of features of DSVPTC. Overall, the prevalence of DSVPTC varies from 0.7-6.6% of all papillary thyroid carcinoma. Higher prevalence of DSVPTC was noted in paediatric patients and in patients affected by irradiation. DSVPTC tends to occur more frequently in women and in patients in the third decade of life. Macroscopically, DSVPTC can involve the thyroid gland extensively without forming a dominant mass. Microscopic examination of DSVPTC revealed extensive fibrosis, squamous metaplasia and numerous psammoma bodies. The latter pathological feature can aid in the pre-operative diagnosis of the entity by fine needle aspiration and ultrasound. Compared to conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma, DSVPTC had a higher incidence of lymph node metastases at presentation. Distant metastases were noted in approximately 5% of the cases. Patients with DSVPTC were recommended to be managed by aggressive treatment protocols. It is likely that as a result of this, the prognosis of the patients with DSVPTC was noted to be similar to conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma. Overall, cancer recurrence and cancer related mortality have been reported in 14% and 3%, respectively, of patients with DSVPTC. In immunohistochemical studies, DSVPTC showed different expression patterns of epithelial membrane antigen, galectin 3, cell adhesion molecules, p53 and p63 when compared to conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma. On genetic analysis, the occurrence of BRAF and RAS mutations are uncommon events in DSVPTC and activation of RET/PTC rearrangements are common. To conclude, DSVPTC has different clinical, pathological and molecular profiles when compared to conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma. ",

The aim of this study was to analyze SLP-2 expression pattern in benign and malignant thyroid tumors (n = 210) and to examine its relationship with clinicopathological parameters and BRAFV600E mutation in thyroid cancer. SLP-2 immunohistochemical expression was not detected in benign adenomas and was absent/weak in follicular and anaplastic carcinomas. High expression levels of SLP-2, found only in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), particularly in the classical variant, were significantly associated with adverse clinicopathological parameters: lymph node metastasis (p = 0.002), extrathyroid invasion (p < 0.001), pT status (p < 0.001), and advanced tumor stage (p = 0.001). Additional genotyping of PTC cases for the BRAFV600E mutation revealed for the first time a close relation between SLP-2 overexpression and the presence of BRAF mutation (p = 0.02) with high positive rates of lymph node metastasis (70%) and extrathyroid invasion (80%) in these cases. The significant association of SLP-2 overexpression with unfavorable clinicopathological characteristics and BRAFV600E mutation indicates that SLP-2 may have a role in aggressiveness of BRAF-mutated PTC and that SLP-2 evaluation could be clinically useful in identification of high-risk PTC patients.

A p-value with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and a fold change > 2 were used as a threshold of significance for differential expression. Network and pathway utilities were employed to interpret significance of expression data. BRAF mutational status was established by direct sequencing the hotspot region of exon 15.;We identified 237 annotated genes that were significantly differentially expressed between BRAFwt and BRAFmut PTCs. Of these, 110 genes were down- and 127 were upregulated in BRAFwt compared to BRAFmut PTCs. A number of molecules involved in thyroid hormone metabolism including thyroid peroxidase (TPO) were differentially expressed between both groups. Among cancer-associated molecules were ERBB3 that was downregulated and ERBB4 that was upregulated in BRAFwt PTCs. Two microRNAs were significantly differentially expressed of which miR492 bears predicted functions relevant to thyroid-specific molecules. The protein kinase A (PKA) and the G protein-coupled receptor pathways were identified as significantly related signaling cascades to the gene set of 237 genes. Furthermore, a network of interacting molecules was predicted on basis of the differentially expressed gene set.;The expression study focusing on affected genes that are differentially expressed between BRAFwt and BRAFmut conventional PTCs identified a number of molecules which are connected in a network and affect important canonical pathways. The identified gene set adds to our understanding of the tumor biology of BRAFwt and BRAFmut PTCs and contains genes/biomarkers of interest.",

DNase I protection indicates two domains of protein-DNA interaction, and each domain separately can confer Ras-mediated transcriptional inducibility. This bipartite RRE was also found to be Raf responsive. By affinity screening, we have cloned a cDNA coding for a zinc finger transcription factor (RREB-1) that binds to the distal RRE. The consensus binding site for this factor is CCCCAAACCACCCC. RREB-1 is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues outside the adult brain. Overexpression of RREB-1 protein in TT cells confers the ability to mediate increased transactivation of the CT gene promoter-reporter construct during Ras- or Raf-induced differentiation.

We carried out a systematic literature review specifically for dietary supplement and thyroid cancer risk. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Dissertations and Theses were systematically searched to identify original epidemiological studies with a comparison group that investigated vitamin or mineral supplementation as an etiological factor for thyroid cancer. In total, 11 independent studies were identified and reviewed. Our qualitative summary showed conflicting results for common antioxidants including vitamins A, C, and E and β-carotene in relation to thyroid cancer. Similarly, results for dietary supplement combinations as well as other individual vitamins and minerals (vitamin B complex, vitamin D, iodine, calcium, zinc, magnesium, and iron) are largely inconsistent across studies. Overall, our review suggested that the current evidence to support any protective or hazardous effect of vitamin or mineral supplements on thyroid cancer development is inconclusive and additional studies addressing previous limitations are necessary to elucidate this possible association. In particular, reverse causality is of major concern and should be addressed by prospective studies with large and representative samples.",

In this study, we present a novel prediction system for the lymph node metastasis based on the histological and cyclin D1 staining features. The frequency of lymph node metastases from a series of 210 papillary thyroid carcinomas was analyzed according to the clinicopathological variables, cyclin D1 staining patterns and BRAF(V600E) mutation in tumor tissue. A total of 113 (54%) patients had lymph node metastasis. Cyclin D1 was constantly expressed at the invasive tumor front and revealed well-defined isolated glands of tumor cells in the extra-tumoral region (isolated glands) and laterally spreading tubular growth along the fibrous septa around the invasive front of the tumor (lateral tubular growth). Upon univariate analysis, an age of less than 45 years (P<0.001), tumor size of 10 mm or more (P<0.001), non-follicular variant (P=0.005), invasive growth pattern (P=0.007), extrathyroid extension (P=0.006), isolated glands (P<0.001), lateral tubular growth (P<0.001) and tumor multiplicity (P=0.005) predicted lymph node metastasis, whereas BRAF(V600E) mutation did not. Upon multivariate analysis, age (P=0.001, odds ratio (OR)=5.146), tumor size (P=0.034, OR=3.119), isolated glands (P<0.001, OR=21.042) and lateral tubular growth (P<0.001, OR=24.652) were found to be strong independent predictors of lymph node metastasis. Cyclin D1 staining of papillary thyroid carcinoma is very useful for identifying the intrathyroidal spreading or multifocality of the tumors. Tumor growth patterns verified by cyclin D1 staining can be used for the identification of papillary thyroid carcinomas with metastatic potential.",

The use of molecular data to improve the preoperative diagnosis of thyroid cancer on materiel from fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is in the course of validation by numerous teams throughout the world. We have proposed a molecular test based on the expression level of a series of 19 genes, capable of discriminating malignant from benign tumors [15]. A prospective study aiming at the clinical validation of the molecular test has been performed on a cohort of 730 patients with a thyroid nodule. In patients subjected to tumor resection (≈ 220), the preoperative molecular diagnosis (generated on FNAB material from analyses of the expression level of the 19 genes) was compared to the postoperative diagnosis given by the pathologist (used as reference). Treatment and follow-up of the serious forms of thyroid cancer should benefit by the early identification of tumors with a metastatic potential using molecular characteristics differentiating invasive and non-invasive thyroid carcinomas. We have performed genetic and genomic analyses on a series of 200 papillary thyroid carcinomas (non-invasive or NI-PTC, 50%; invasive or I-PTC, 50%). BRAF(V600E) mutation or/and RET/PTC gene rearrangement have been detected in less than 25% of NI-PTC but in more than 75% of I-PTC. Pan-genomic analyses (Agilent microarray) revealed that 1373 genes are differentially expressed (fold change greater than 2) in NI-PTC as compared to I-PTC samples. The majority of genes (≈ 1200) are overexpressed in I-PTC. Data related to the two domains: diagnosis and prognosis of thyroid cancer will be presented at 2011 International H.P.

Here, we show that FOXM1 is significantly increased in ATCs compared with normal thyroid, well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas (papillary and/or follicular), and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas (P=0.000002). Upregulation of FOXM1 levels in ATC cells was mechanistically linked to loss-of-function of p53 and to the hyperactivation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT/FOXO3a pathway. Knockdown of FOXM1 by RNA interference inhibited cell proliferation by arresting cells in G2/M and reduced cell invasion and motility. This phenotype was associated with decreased expression of FOXM1 target genes, like cyclin B1 (CCNB1), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), Aurora B (AURKB), S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2), and plasminogen activator, urokinase: uPA (PLAU). Pharmacological inhibition of FOXM1 in an orthotopic mouse model of ATC reduced tumor burden and metastasization.

The effects of MDL-101, 371 on tumor cells were associated with induction of apoptosis, as demonstrated by DNA fragmentation assay. Flow cytometric analysis of the expression of apoptosis-related genes revealed the increased levels of Fas-antigen, whereas the levels of Bcl-2 were not significantly influenced in thyroid cancer cells treated with MDL-101,731.

BRaf is activated by Ras proteins allowing Ras oncogenes to constitutively activate the pathway. Activating BRaf mutations are also frequent in several cancers, being the most common oncogenic mutation in thyroid carcinoma and melanoma. There are currently two inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, approved for treatment of malignant melanoma having activating BRaf mutations. Concurrent administration of BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor (trametinib) is significantly more active in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma than either single agent alone, but progression to resistance ultimately occurs by different mechanisms that increase the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Such adaptive changes in tumor cell signaling networks allow bypass of targeted oncoprotein inhibition. This is true with targeted inhibitors for BRaf and MEK as well as specific inhibitors for AKT, mTOR, and many receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGF receptor (EGFR) and HER2. It is this adaptive response to targeted kinase inhibitors that contributes to the failure of single-agent kinase inhibitors to have durable responses. This failure is seen in virtually all cancers treated with single-agent kinase inhibitors, most of which are not as dependent on a single signaling pathway such as BRaf-MEK-ERK in melanoma. Thus, understanding the breadth of adaptive reprogramming responses to specific targeted kinase inhibition will be critical to develop appropriate combination therapies for durable clinical responses.",

Even though fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is considered the best method for the diagnosis of thyroid nodules, its efficacy is still questioned for mPTC. We investigated the role of BRAF gene status in preoperative cytological samples, using manual macrodissection as an additional tool to improve the diagnostic accuracy of mPTC.;DNA was extracted directly from stained FNAC smears of 95 patients including 85 with histological diagnoses of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) ≤1 cm and 10 with goiters. The cytological diagnoses of the 95 cases included the following: 42 samples were suspicious for papillary carcinoma, 38 were PTCs, and 15 were indeterminate lesions. DNA was then extracted from the FNAC slides after performing a \"manual macrodissection\" procedure. The BRAF(V600E) mutational status was determined by sequence analysis in all the patients.;In this study, we showed that the BRAF(V600E) mutation was present with a high frequency in patients with mPTC (74%). The presence of the mutation was independent of the size of the tumor. In our study, the combination of the cytological diagnosis and the molecular analysis was able to identify 82% of all cases of mPTC, with an increase of 37% compared with a morphological diagnosis alone. The morpho-molecular analysis was able to reduce the number of suspicious cases by >70%. All of the goiters had a wild-type BRAF status.;The analysis of BRAF mutational status in FNAC obtained from papillary microcarcinomas demonstrates that molecular pathology, combined with morphology and molecular biology is a powerful tool for cytological diagnosis of mPTC.

One of these rare and poorly characterized variants is papillary thyroid carcinoma with nodular fasciitis-like stroma, of which fewer than 30 cases have been documented, mostly as isolated reports. It is a dual tumor comprising a malignant epithelial proliferation that harbors typical features of conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma, admixed with a prominent mesenchymal proliferation resembling nodular fasciitis or fibromatosis. Thus, the terms papillary thyroid carcinoma with nodular fasciitis-like stroma and papillary thyroid carcinoma with fibromatosis-like stroma are used interchangeably; however, the former term suggests a self-limited and regressing disease, whereas the latter one suggests a recurrent and potentially aggressive one. Better genetic and ultrastructural characterization could lead to more appropriate terminology and management. We performed detailed clinicopathological and molecular analyses of two cases of PTC with prominent mesenchymal proliferation that developed in the thyroid gland of two male patients aged 34 and 48. In both cases, the epithelial component harbored a heterozygous somatic activating BRAF mutation (p.V600E). Also, in both cases, the mesenchymal component showed typical aberrant nuclear and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for β-catenin and harbored a heterozygous somatic activating mutation in the corresponding CTNNB1 gene (p.S45P). This mutation has never been reported in thyroid stroma; in other tissues, it is typical of desmoid-type fibromatosis rather than nodular fasciitis-like stroma. We therefore propose that in cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma with a prominent mesenchymal component, mutations in CTNNB1 should be sought; when they are present, the term 'papillary thyroid carcinoma with desmoid-type fibromatosis' should be used. As the mesenchymal component of these tumors is not expected to concentrate radioactive iodine, special considerations apply to clinical evaluation and follow-up, which should be brought to the attention of the treating specialist.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 7 October 2016; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2016.173.",

However, misdiagnosis of malignancy by FNA is not rare, even if image examination suggests the possibility of thyroid cancer. In the present study, the clinicopathological factors of patients whose preoperative FNA examination had not led to a diagnosis of thyroid cancer were examined. In total, 125 patients with thyroid cancer who underwent FNA and surgery (total thyroidectomy, subtotal thyroidectomy or hemithyroidectomy) at the Department of Surgery, Surgical Oncology and Science of the Sapporo Medical University Hospital between 2006 and 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups: Group A, malignancy determined by FNA, and group B, no malignancy. The groups were then compared by gender, age, tumor size, stage, tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, histology, surgical procedure methods, presence or absence of calcification and thyroglobulin levels. The mean age of the patients in group A (5 males and 59 females) was 53.0 years. The mean age in group B (11 males and 49 females) was 54.2 years. The mean tumor size in both groups was 1.6 cm. The mean thyroglobulin levels were 82.7 ng/ml in Group A and 525.5 ng/ml in group B. There were also significant differences between the groups for tumor stage (P=0.046), histological type (P=0.024) and thyroglobulin levels (P=0.035). The results of the present study suggested that it may be difficult to diagnose thyroid cancer by FNA in cases with non-papillary carcinoma and higher thyroglobulin levels.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Sustained activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway can lead to cell cycle arrest in many cell types. We have found, with human medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) cells, that activated Ras or c-Raf-1 can induce growth arrest by producing and secreting an autocrine-paracrine factor. This protein was purified from cell culture medium conditioned by Raf-activated MTC cells and was identified by mass spectrometry as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF expression upon Raf activation and subsequent activation of JAK-STAT3 was also observed in small cell lung carcinoma cells, suggesting that this autocrine-paracrine signaling may be a common response to Ras/Raf activation. LIF was sufficient to induce growth arrest and differentiation of MTC cells. This effect was mediated through the gp130/JAK/STAT3 pathway, since anti-gp130 blocking antibody or dominant-negative STAT3 blocked the effects of LIF. Thus, LIF expression provides a novel mechanism allowing Ras/Raf signaling to activate the JAK-STAT3 pathway. In addition to this cell-extrinsic growth inhibitory pathway, we find that the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway induces an intracellular growth inhibitory signal, independent of the LIF/JAK/STAT3 pathway. Therefore, activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway can lead to growth arrest and differentiation via at least two different signaling pathways. This use of multiple pathways may be important for \"fail-safe\" induction and maintenance of cell cycle arrest.",

The genes, coding the signaling cascade proteins (RET, RAS, BRAF, PI3K, PTEN, AKT), are mutated or aberrantly expressed in thyroid cancer derived from follicular thyroid cell. Genetic and epigenetic alternations, concerning MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, contribute to their activation and interaction in consequence of malignant follicular cell transformation. Moreover, it is additionally pointed out that genetic, as well as epigenetic DNA changing via aberrant methylation of several tumor suppressor and thyroid-specific genes is associated with tumor aggressiveness, being a jointly responsible mechanism for thyroid tumorigenesis. In the present manuscript the currently developed diagnostic and prognostic genetic/epigenetic markers are presented; the understanding of this molecular mechanism provides access to novel molecular therapeutic strategies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) are aggressive thyroid tumors associated with a high mortality rate of 38-57 % and almost 100 % respectively. Several recent studies utilizing next generation sequencing techniques have shed lights on the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors, providing evidence to support a stepwise tumoral progression from well-differentiated to poorly differentiated, and finally to anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. While BRAF (V600E) and RAS mutations remain the main drivers in aggressive thyroid carcinoma, PDTC and ATC gains additional mutations, e.g., TERT promoter mutation, TP53 mutation, as well as frequent alterations in PIK3CA-PTEN-AKT-mTOR pathway, SWI-SNF complex, histomethyltransferases, and mismatch repair genes. RAS-mutated PDTCs are commonly associated with a histologic phenotype defined by Turin proposal, high frequency of distant metastasis, high thyroid differentiation score, and a RAS-like gene expression profile, whereas BRAF-mutated PDTCs are usually defined solely by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) criteria with a propensity for nodal metastasis and are less differentiated with a BRAF-like expression signature. Such demarcation is largely lost in ATC which is characterized by genomic complexity, heavy mutation burden, and profound undifferentiation. Additionally, several molecular events, e.g., EIF1AX mutation, mutation burden, and chromosome 1q gain in PDTCs, as well as EIF1AX mutation, chromosome 13q loss, and 20q gains in ATCs, may serve as adverse prognostic markers predicting poor clinical outcome.

Despite KRAS being the 6th most frequently mutated gene for all cancers, the reported frequency in thyroid cancer is only 2%. This may be due, in part, to the use of insensitive mutation detection methods such as DNA sequencing. Therefore, using the sensitive and quantitative ACB-PCR approach, we quantified KRAS codon 12 GGT → GAT and GGT → GTT mutant fraction (MF) in 20 normal thyroid tissues, 17 primary PTC, 2 metastatic PTC, and 1 anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. We observed measurable levels of KRAS codon 12 GAT or GTT mutation in all normal thyroid tissues. For PTCs, 29.4% and 35.3% had KRAS codon 12 GAT and GTT MF above the 95% upper confidence interval for the corresponding MFs in normal thyroid. The highest observed KRAS codon 12 GTT MFs were associated with tumors with follicular characteristics and relatively high levels of tumor necrosis.

However, until now, rearrangements have only been detected in fresh FNA material and the number of follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs) was rather low in previous studies. We aimed at investigating the impact of point mutations and rearrangement detection in a set of routine air-dried FNA smears with a higher percentage of FTCs.;RNA and DNA was extracted from 310 FNAs (164 indeterminate, 57 malignant, 89 benign) and corresponding formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (156 follicular adenomas [FAs], 32 FTCs, 44 papillary thyroid carcinomas [PTCs], 9 follicular variant PTCs, and 69 goiters). PAX8/PPARG and RET/PTC rearrangements were detected by qPCR, BRAF and RAS mutations by high-resolution melting PCR and by pyrosequencing.;Forty-seven mutations were detected in the FNAs: 22 BRAF, 13 NRAS, and 3 HRAS mutations, 8 PAX8/PPARG, and one RET/PTC-rearrangement. While the presence of a BRAF and RET/PTC mutation was associated with cancer in 100% of samples each, the presence of a RAS and PAX8/PPARG mutation was associated with cancer in only 12% and 50% of samples, respectively. In the indeterminate group 4 of 25 carcinomas were identified by molecular FNA screening, which increased the sensitivity from 67% (cytology alone) to 75% (cytology plus molecular screening).;Molecular screening for point mutations and rearrangements is feasible in air-dried FNAs. Although the impact of detecting point mutations and rearrangements in FNAs has most likely been overestimated in previous studies, molecular FNA analyses improve presurgical diagnostics. The detection of BRAF mutations in FNA may improve the choice of surgery and postsurgical treatment. Further data are necessary to elucidate the true impact of detecting RAS and PAX8/PPARG mutations in FNAs. The inclusion of additional rare somatic mutations and miRNA markers might further improve the impact of molecular FNA diagnostics.",

Over the past 15 years, the application of molecular technologies to the study of these neoplasms has elucidated critical genetic pathways associated with the development of specific thyroid tumor types. In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), genetic events involve RET and TRK (rearrangements) and BRAF and RAS (mutations), although RAS mutations are uncommon except in the follicular variant of PTC. These genetic alterations, which rarely overlap in the same tumor, result in signaling abnormalities in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In contrast, genetic alterations in follicular carcinomas include PAX8-PPARgamma translocations and RAS mutations while mutations of CTNNB1 and p53 have been implicated in the development and progression of poorly differentiated and undifferentiated (anaplastic) thyroid carcinomas. Germline mutations of RET are responsible for the development of heritable forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) while somatic mutations of this oncogene are found in a significant proportion of sporadic MTCs. The results of these studies not only have provided additional approaches to thyroid tumor classification, but also have stimulated the development of novel approaches to tumor diagnosis and additional parameters for prognostic assessment and potential biologic therapeutic strategies.",

Eighteen EPONs were retrieved from our surgical pathology files and reviewed for defining morphologic features. Cases having the typical nuclear features of PTC were excluded.

Cases were evaluated for rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid carcinoma RET/PTC rearrangement by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The majority of the tumors exhibited a distinctive histologic appearance. They were composed of true papillae lined by a single layer of predominantly cuboidal cells with oncocytic cytoplasm; hobnailing was typically prominent. Three tumors showed taller cells with uniformly apical nuclei and no hobnailing. Ten of 18 cases showed vascular and/or capsular invasion; hence, if the diagnostic criteria used to evaluate follicular neoplasms are applied, more than half of the tumors would be considered minimally invasive carcinomas. No cases were immunoreactive with antibodies to HBME1, whereas only 1 of 13 was immunoreactive for CK19. Six of 7 interpretable cases were immunoreactive for CD56.

        "Doc_abstract":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common thyroid cancer, and it early metastasizes into regional lymph nodes. We evaluated immunohistochemically the expression of the hypoxia marker hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) as well as extracellular matrix protein tenascin C as a marker of stroma remodelling in a cohort of 160 PTCs. Expression of HIF-1α was seen focally accentuated in 100 of the 160 tumours (62.5 %) including 16 cases with equivocal staining (faint staining or only single-cell staining) and 84 cases with unequivocal staining. HIF-1α expression correlated with the degree of desmoplastic stromal reaction as well as with the expression of tenascin C (p < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test, respectively). Moreover, expression of HIF-1α was significantly associated with the presence of lymph node metastases (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test) as well as signs of invasion, namely, peritumoural and extrathyroidal invasion as well as angioinvasion (p = 0.024, p < 0.001, p = 0.017, Mann-Whitney test, respectively). Additionally, PTC with unequivocal HIF-1α nuclear staining was a larger tumour than PTC with negative (-) or equivocal HIF-1α expression (p < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). Interestingly, the expression of HIF-1α was not significantly associated with BRAF V600E status (p > 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Our data show that the expression of HIF-1α is associated with stroma remodelling processes within the tumour and, thus, may play an important role in an invasive behaviour of these tumours independent of BRAF mutation status.",

In addition, NIS mRNA was quantified in 145 DTC patients and 85 PTC cases were screened for BRAF(V600E) mutation.;We found low NIS mRNA expression and low or negative NIS protein expression in most DTC. NIS expression was lower in DTC patients over 45 years old and in tumours larger than 2 cm. There was a tendency for lower NIS expression in advanced stages and patients presenting recurrences. All 13 DTC patients who succumbed to the disease were NIS negative at immunohistochemistry and had very low mRNA expression. NIS expression was lower in PTC presenting BRAF(V600E) mutation. However, neither NIS immunohistochemical analysis nor NIS mRNA quantified expression could identify individuals with poor prognosis.;Our data suggest that NIS expression may help characterize patients' risk and individuals with a poor response to therapy, but is not useful as a diagnostic or prognostic marker, reinforcing the current concept that an appropriate management of DTC patient is the most important and modifiable prognostic factor.",

These mutations-in particular the most common substitution, V600E-are oncogenic drivers and important therapeutic targets. The development of small-molecule Raf inhibitors allowed rapid translation of basic advances to the clinic. In BRAF-mutant melanomas, orally bioavailable B-Raf inhibitors, such as vemurafenib, achieve dramatic responses initially, but this is followed by rapid emergence of resistance driven by numerous mechanisms and requiring second-generation treatment approaches. In tumors with wild-type B-Raf, vemurafenib paradoxically activates downstream signaling and cell proliferation and is thus contraindicated, highlighting again the importance of genotype-based clinical decision making. These advances were greatly facilitated by the study of biopsied tumor tissue, especially at the time of drug resistance. Combinatorial approaches targeting the Raf pathway hold promise for even more substantial clinical benefits in the future. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The major concerns in the surgical treatment of extensive or recurrent thyroid cancer include the difficulty of precise intraoperative and real-time tumor localization, the possibility of missing small metastatic lymph nodes during the operation, the need for reoperation due to recurrence, and complications. The usefulness and feasibility of an intraoperative PET probe have been reported for many other cancers; however, a standard, radioguided, operative protocol using a PET probe in thyroid cancer has not been established. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the feasibility of an intraoperative PET probe with respect to precise tumor localization, verification of complete resection, and a decrease in unnecessary reoperations and complications.;This was a prospective, controlled study. Inclusion criteria were thyroid cancer requiring a total thyroidectomy with a modified radical neck dissection (MRND) and recurrent thyroid cancer after thyroid surgery. The types of procedures included total thyroidectomy with MRND, selective neck dissection (SND), and excision of recurrent thyroid masses. The PET probe NodeSeeker(®) is a high-energy gamma probe seeking 511 keV photons. Operative exploration was carried out between 2 and 6 h after injection of (18)F-FDG. The surgeon calculated the target-to-background ratio (T/B ratio) by checking the 10-sec accumulated count using the PET probe. We performed a re-exploration if the T/B ratio was >1.3 in the operative bed.;Twelve patients underwent PET probe-guided operation. SNDs, mass excisions, total thyroidectomy with MRND, and MRND were performed on 7, 4, and 1 patient, respectively. All tumors were localized by the PET probe precisely in real time, and the lesions not observed on preoperative PET were detected by the PET probe in 7 patients. Furthermore, additional lymph nodes that were not identified on preoperative ultrasonography were detected in 1 patient. The mean T/B ratio of thyroid carcinoma was 1.51 ± 0.53 (range, 1.17-4.03) and the postoperative serum thyroglobulin off thyroid hormone was <2.0 ng/ml.;Radioguided surgery using an intraoperative PET probe in thyroid cancer appears to be a useful method for real-time tumor localization, verification of complete excision, and minimization of the possibility of residual cancer. Therefore, an intraoperative PET probe in thyroid cancer may decrease unnecessary reoperations and complications due to persistent disease.",

Dkk-1 reversed the aberrant expression of β-catenin from nucleus to membrane and inhibited basal levels of TCF/LEF-dependent transcriptional activities. Furthermore, Dkk-1 inhibited cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and adenoviral transduction of constitutively active β-catenin blocked these effects, thus suggesting that the Dkk-1 anti-tumoral effect is mediated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Bromodeoxyuridine assay showed minimal effects of Dkk-1 on cell proliferation. Flow cytometric analysis with Annexin V staining showed marked induction of cell apoptosis by Dkk-1 treatment.

Regarding a FNA classification, the Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathology published a few years ago is expected to become prevailing in the world. Currently the WHO classification of sixth version is used in Japan and the JTA guidelines will adopt a modified WHO classification: \"Indeterminate\" is divided into two categories; \"Indeterminate A, considering follicular tumor\" and \"Indeterminate B, considering other than follicular tumor\".

We found the following therapeutic categories were the most enriched categories with antiproliferative activity: cardiotonic and antiobesity agents. Sixteen agents had an efficacy of greater than 60% and a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the nanomolar range. We validated the results of the qHTS using two agents (bortezomib and ouabain) in additional cell lines representing different histological subtypes of thyroid cancer and with different mutations (BRAF V600E, RET/PTC1, p53, PTEN). Both agents induced apoptosis, and ouabain also caused cell cycle arrest.;To our knowledge, this is the first study to use qHTS of a large drug library to identify candidate drugs for anticancer therapy.

Although BRAF(V600E) inhibitors are available, lack of response has been frequently observed. To study the mechanism underlying intrinsic resistance to the mutant BRAF(V600E) selective inhibitor vemurafenib, we established short-term primary cell cultures of human metastatic/recurrent BRAF(V600E)-PTC, intrathyroidal BRAF(V600E)-PTC, and normal thyroid (NT). We also generated an early intervention model of human BRAF(V600E)-PTC orthotopic mouse. We find that metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells elicit paracrine-signaling which trigger migration of pericytes, blood endothelial cells and lymphatic endothelial cells as compared to BRAF(WT)-PTC cells, and show a higher rate of invasion. We further show that vemurafenib therapy significantly suppresses these aberrant functions in non-metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells but lesser in metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells as compared to vehicle treatment. These results concur with similar folds of down-regulation of tumor microenvironment-associated pro-metastatic molecules, with no effects in BRAF(WT)-PTC and NT cells. Our early intervention preclinical trial shows that vemurafenib delays tumor growth in the orthotopic BRAF(WT/V600E)-PTC mice. Importantly, we identify high copy number gain of MCL1 (chromosome 1q) and loss of CDKN2A (P16, chromosome 9p) in metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cells which are associated with resistance to vemurafenib treatment. Critically, we demonstrate that combined vemurafenib therapy with BCL2/MCL1 inhibitor increases metastatic BRAF(V600E)-PTC cell death and ameliorates response to vemurafenib treatment as compared to single agent treatment. In conclusion, short-term PTC and NT cultures offer a predictive model for evaluating therapeutic response in patients with PTC. Our PTC pre-clinical model suggests that combined targeted therapy might be an important therapeutic strategy for metastatic and refractory BRAF(V600E)-positive PTC.",

In light of the new finding that most PTC consist of a mixture of tumor cells with wild-type and mutant BRAF, we examined the associations between the percentage of BRAF(V600E) alleles and both the clinicopathological parameters at time of diagnosis and the disease outcome in a large series of PTCs.;Tumors from 168 patients with PTC were genotyped for BRAF(V600E) using BigDye Terminator sequencing and pyrosequencing, and the clinical parameters were analyzed. The associations between clinicopathological characteristics, including disease recurrence at follow-up (median 5.1 yr) and the percentage of mutant BRAF alleles were assessed.;The observed prevalence of BRAF(V600E) was higher when using pyrosequencing then when using BigDye Terminator sequencing (53.6 vs. 36.9%). In the PTC positive for BRAF(V600E), the percentage of mutant alleles ranged from 5.1 to 44.7% of the total BRAF alleles, with a median of 20.6%. The presence or the percentage of BRAF(V600E) alleles did not correlate significantly with sex, multicentricity, lymph node metastasis, or tumor stage. The percentage of BRAF(V600E) alleles directly correlated with age at diagnosis and tumor volume (R(2) = 0.223, P = 0.039, and R(2) = 0.166, P < 0.001, respectively). The percentage of BRAF(V600E) alleles (P = 0.014), tumor volume (P = 0.012), and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.008) predicted the disease outcome. The odds ratio of recurrence for PTC with BRAF(V600E) alleles of 30% or greater, compared with that for PTC with BRAF(V600E) alleles of less than 30%, was 5.31 (P = 0.002).;A high percentage of BRAF(V600E) alleles defines a PTC molecular subtype and predicts a poorer disease outcome.

Here, we investigated the role of aberrant DNA methylation in the development of well-differentiated thyroid tumors. We performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in the largest well-differentiated thyroid tumor series reported to date, comprising 83 primary tumors as well as 8 samples of adjacent normal tissue. The epigenetic profiles were closely related to not only tumor histology but also the underlying driver mutation; we found that follicular tumors had higher levels of methylation, which seemed to accumulate in a progressive manner along the tumorigenic process from adenomas to carcinomas. Furthermore, tumors harboring a BRAF or RAS mutation had a larger number of hypo- or hypermethylation events, respectively. The aberrant methylation of several candidate genes potentially related to thyroid carcinogenesis was validated in an independent series of 52 samples. Furthermore, through the integration of methylation and transcriptional expression data, we identified genes whose expression is associated with the methylation status of their promoters. Finally, by integrating clinical follow-up information with methylation levels we propose etoposide-induced 2.4 and Wilms tumor 1 as novel prognostic markers related to recurrence-free survival. This comprehensive study provides insights into the role of DNA methylation in well-differentiated thyroid cancer development and identifies novel markers associated with recurrence-free survival. ",

Because the role of TrkA was not completely elucidated in thyroid cancer ethiopathogenesis, we decided to study the expression of active, phosphorylated TrkA and of its coreceptor p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75 NTR) in a series of 92 PTC (37 lesions of conventional PTC, 28 of follicular variant of PTC [FVPTC], and 27 of other variants of PTC) as well as in 21 samples of normal thyroid and nonneoplastic thyroid lesions used as a controls.

No immunoexpression of p75 NTR was observed in normal thyroid nor in nonneoplastic thyroid lesions. The cellular localization of p75 NTR immunoexpression was also significantly associated with the growth pattern of PTC, being much more frequently detected in an apical localization in PTC with papillary architecture than in PTC with a follicular or solid growth pattern. This apical localization of p75 NTR was significantly associated with the presence of BRAF V600E.

Tumor-specific survival analysis (mean follow-up, 5.5 years) demonstrated no significant difference, but a tendency toward worse prognosis of BRAF-positive patients compared to BRAF-negative patients or rearrangement-positive patients, respectively.;Long-term follow-up data on large tumor panels are needed to disclose significant survival differences of prognostic predictors on PTC. This study provides further evidence that patients harboring BRAF-V600E-positive PTCs may experience an unfavorable course of the disease compared to patients with tumors carrying other genetic alterations.",

These rearrangements result in the formation of chimaeric genes composed of the tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK1 fused to 5' sequences of different genes. To investigate if the NTRK1 gene plays a role in radiation-induced thyroid carcinogenesis, we looked for the presence of NTRK1-activating rearrangements in 32 human thyroid tumours (16 follicular adenomas, 14 papillary carcinomas and two lymph-node metastases of papillary thyroid carcinomas) from patients who had received external radiation, using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Southern blot and direct sequencing techniques. These data were compared with those obtained in a series of 28 'spontaneous' benign and malignant thyroid tumours, collected from patients without a history of radiation exposure and four in vitro culture cell lines derived from 'spontaneous' thyroid cancers. Our results concerning the radiation-associated tumours showed that only rearrangements between NTRK1 and TPM3 genes (TRK oncogene) were detected in 2/14 papillary carcinomas and in one lymph-node metastasis of one of these papillary thyroid carcinomas. All the radiation-associated adenomas were negative. In the 'spontaneous' tumours, only one of the 14 papillary carcinomas and one of the four in vitro culture cell lines, derived from a papillary carcinoma, presented a NTRK1 rearrangement also with the TPM3 gene. Twenty-five of this series of radiation-associated tumours were previously studied for the ras and RET/PTC oncogenes. In conclusion, our data: (a) show that the overall frequency of NTRK1 rearrangements is similar between radiation-associated (2/31: 6%) and 'spontaneous' epithelial thyroid tumours (2/32: 6%). The frequency, if we consider exclusively the papillary carcinomas, is in both cases 12%; (b) show that the TRK oncogene plays a role in the development of a minority of radiation-associated papillary thyroid carcinomas but not in adenomas; and (c) confirm that RET/PTC rearrangements are the major genetic alteration associated with ionizing radiation-induced thyroid tumorigenesis.",

From 2011 to 2014, 197 patients with PTC (246 tumor foci in all) underwent FDG-PET. Among these patients, 46 underwent neck dissection for lateral neck metastasis. According to the FDG avidity of the tumor foci or lateral neck metastasis, factors associated with the prognostic value were evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Among the 197 patients, 7 (3.6 %) were incidentally found to have non-thyroid origin malignancy. Additionally, 63.0 % (155/246) of PTC foci showed FDG uptake on PET/CT. Univariate analysis showed that the tumor size, the presence of extrathyroidal extension, BRAF mutation, and Hashimoto thyroiditis were associated with FDG avidity. However, except for pathological extrathyroidal extension, the other factors showed statistically significant correlations with FDG avidity (p < 0.001, p = 0.008, and p = 0.009, respectively). FDG uptake in lateral neck node metastasis showed high specificity and negative predictive value (NPV). In four cases of nonspecific findings on ultrasonography (USG)/CT, FDG avidity was helpful to diagnose the presence of lateral neck metastasis. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of PET/CT was correlated with the maximum diameter of the involved lateral node. FDG avidity did not show any significance in the recurrence-free survival of both the thyroid tumor and lateral neck metastasis. The FDG avidity of PTC did not show prognostic predictive meaning. However, in the case of lateral neck metastasis, FDG avidity showed high sensitivity and NPV, and could provide better information in cases of nonspecific findings on USG and CT. ",

Critically, it remains constitutively active in approximately 30% of human cancers, having key roles in cancer development, maintenance and progression, while being responsible for poorer prognosis and drug resistance. Consequently, the inhibition of this pathway has been the subject of intense research for >25 years. The advent of better patient screening techniques has increasingly shown that upstream regulators like RAS and RAF remain persistently mutated in many cancer types. These gain-of-function mutations, such as KRAS-4B(G12V/G13D/Q61K), NRAS(Q61L/Q61R) or BRAF(V600E), lead to tremendous increase in their activities, resulting in constitutively active extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). They were not efficiently targeted by the first-generation inhibitors such as Lonafarnib or Sorafenib, which were essentially broad spectrum inhibitors targeting pan-RAS and pan-RAF, respectively. This triggered the development of the second-generation inhibitors selective against the mutated proteins. Second generation inhibitors such as Vemurafenib (Zelboraf) and Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) targeting BRAF(V600E), Trametinib (Mekinist) targeting MEK1/2 and the first generation pan-RAF inhibitor Sorafenib (Nexavar) have already been approved for treating renal, hepatocellular, thyroid cancers and BRAF(V600E/K) harboring metastatic melanoma. Others against RAF and MEK1/2 are presently undergoing clinical trials. Their success would depend on the better understanding of the acquired resistance mechanisms to these drugs in the cancer cells and the identification of predictive biomarkers for the proper administration of suitable inhibitor(s).

Mig-6 expression inversely correlated with PTC size but had no association with other clinicopathological variables including age, extrathyroidal extension, lymphovascular invasion, or histological subtype. Mig-6 knockdown in thyroid cancer cell lines resulted in EGFR phosphorylation and diminished NF-κB activity, whereas Mig-6 overexpression had the opposite effects.

The reference center-based retrospective cohort included 201 (75.6%) females and 65 (24.4%) males aged 48.0±16.1 years (8-83 years old, range) diagnosed and treated for PTC during 1993-2008. Follow-up period was 53.1±41.6 months (7-187 months, range). BRAF and RAS mutations were determined by direct sequencing of genomic DNA. RET/PTC rearrangements were analyzed by RT-PCR/Southern blotting. Genetic alterations were detected in 150/266 tumors (56.4%). One tumor displayed two genetic alterations. The BRAF(V600E) was found in 84/266 (31.6%) cases, RAS mutations in 11/266 (4.1%) and RET/PTC in 55/266 (20.7%; 42/266 (15.8%) RET/PTC1 and 13/266 (4.9%) RET/PTC3). On multivariate analysis BRAF(V600E) was associated with the classical papillary morphology (P = 0.05), the higher pT category (P = 0.05) and advanced clinical stage (P = 0.03). In a proportional hazard model, BRAF(V600E) did not appear to be an independent risk factor for the faster recurrence (P = 0.784). We conclude that under the extensive thyroid surgery and limited application of radioiodine ablation BRAF(V600E) may not be an indicator of poorer disease-free survival during the short to middle follow-up period.

A constitutively activated NF-κB pathway also closely links Hashimoto's thyroiditis with increased incidence of thyroid cancers. The NF-κB pathway is becoming one of the major targets for drug development, and a number of compounds have been developed to inhibit this pathway at different levels in cancer cells.

In this study, the cellular response to the histone deacetylase inhibitors, sodium butyrate and trichostatin A, was analyzed in cell lines derived from primary anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. HDAIs repress the growth (proliferation) of ATC cell lines, independent of p53 status, through the induction of apoptosis and differential cell cycle arrest (arrested in G1 and G2/M). Apoptosis increases in response to drug treatment and is associated with the appearance of the cleaved form of the caspase substrate, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Cell cycle arrest is associated with the reduced expression of cyclins A and B, the increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21(Cip1/WAF1) and p27Kip1, the reduced phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), and a reduction in cdk2 and cdk1-associated kinase activities. In ATC cells overexpressing cyclin E, drug treatment failed to replicate these events. These results suggest that growth inhibition of ATC cells by HDAIs is due to the promotion of apoptosis through the activation of the caspase cascade and the induction of cell cycle arrest via a reduction in cdk2- and cdk1-associated kinase activities.",

All had undergone first follow-up testing after thyroid hormone withdrawal (off-T4) within 1 year of 131I ablation. Negative first follow-up testing was defined as Tg <2 ng/ml and no neck uptake on 131I diagnostic whole-body scan. Seventy-five patients had stage I thyroid cancer and negative first follow-up testing (group A), 19 had stage I disease and positive first follow-up testing (group B), and 35 had stage II-IV disease (group C). RhTSH stimulation was performed an average of 6 years after first follow-up testing.;131I diagnostic scanning after rhTSH was negative in all 75 group A patients. Only one group A patient had detectable Tg after rhTSH injection (1.5 ng/ml), but Tg had also been detected at baseline in this patient (1.45 ng/ml). Given the absence of a response to stimulation, suggesting an interference, Tg was reassessed with a different technique and proved to be undetectable (<0.1 ng/ml). Stimulation with rhTSH in group B showed residual Tg in seven patients and residual 131I uptake in the thyroid bed in two patients, but none of these patients had signs of disease progression. Five group C patients (14%) had a positive rhTSH test result, and this was suggestive of disease progression in at least two cases.;The first follow-up testing is essential for prognostic classification after 131I ablation of thyroid cancer. In stage I patients, undetectable Tg and negative 131I scan 1 year after ablation define a large population of subjects who have a very low risk of recurrence and who do not require further stimulation tests.

In the EU and USA, lenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of locally recurrent or metastatic progressive, radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC). This approval was based on the results of the randomized, double-blind, multinational, phase 3 SELECT study, in which lenvatinib significantly improved median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate compared with placebo in patients with RR-DTC. The PFS benefit with lenvatinib was seen in all pre-specified subgroups, including patients who had received either one or no prior VEGF-targeted therapy. Moreover, the PFS benefit with lenvatinib was maintained regardless of BRAF or RAS mutation status. The safety and tolerability profile of lenvatinib in SELECT was consistent with that of other VEGF/VEGF receptor-targeted therapies and was mostly manageable. Hypertension was the most common treatment-related adverse event in lenvatinib-treated patients, but only infrequently led to discontinuation of the drug. Although not collected in SELECT, information on quality of life would be useful in assessing the overall impact of therapy on the patient. This notwithstanding, the data which are available indicate that lenvatinib is an effective and generally well-tolerated treatment option for patients with RR-DTC.

Thus, here we report the identification of somatic mutations for Chinese PTC using 402 tumor-normal pairs (Discovery: 91 pairs via exome sequencing; validation: 311 pairs via Sanger sequencing). We observed three distinct mutational signatures, evidently different from the two mutational signatures among Caucasian PTCs. Ten significantly mutated genes were identified, most previously uncharacterized. Notably, we found that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) GAS8-AS1 is the secondary most frequently altered gene and acts as a novel tumor suppressor in PTC. As a mutation hotspot, the c.713A>G/714T>C dinucleotide substitution was found among 89.1% patients with GAS8-AS1 mutations and associated with advanced PTC disease (P = 0.009). Interestingly, the wild-type lncRNA GAS8-AS1 (A713T714) showed consistently higher capability to inhibit cancer cell growth compared to the mutated lncRNA (G713C714). Further studies also elucidated the oncogene nature of the G protein-coupled receptor LPAR4 and its c.872T>G (p.Ile291Ser) mutation in PTC malignant transformation. The BRAF c.1799T>A (p.Val600Glu) substitution was present in 59.0% Chinese PTCs, more frequently observed in patients with lymph node metastasis (P = 1.6 × 10(-4)). Together our study defines a exome mutational spectrum of PTC in the Chinese population and highlights lncRNA GAS8-AS1 and LPAR4 as potential diagnostics and therapeutic targets. ",

Specific aims were (a) to recognize a method with minimal interference, by comparing analyte recoveries, from thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb) that can be present in some thyroid cancer patient samples, (b) to correlate individual results with those from Mayo Medical Laboratories (MML) (current referred out assay service used by our institute), and (c) to compare assay precision.;In evaluating performance of the three immunoassays, procedures were followed as recommended by the respective manufacturers. Parallel comparison of the three immunoassays with the MML procedure was performed with thyroid cancer patient sera. Recovery studies utilized sera from 15 thyroid cancer patients, 4 Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients, and 1 Grave's disease patient. TgAb were also measured directly by an IRMA thyroglobulin antibody kit (Sanofi-Pasteur).;Among the randomly selected 20 samples assayed in parallel studies, low recoveries (< 80%) were present in 2 samples by IRMA assay (Sanofi-Pasteur), 8 samples by FIA assay (Wallac-Delfia), and 10 samples by RIA assay (DPC). The majority of the low recovery samples contained high titers of TgAb. All three kits correlated well with the Mayo method. At the control-1 level (approximately 9.9 microgram/L by Delfia determination), both the IRMA kit (CV = 1.96%, n = 10) and FIA Kit (CV = 2.16%, n = 10) showed good within-run precision.;In our hands, the IRMA Kit (Sanofi-Pasteur) demonstrated excellent precision, analyte recoveries, the least interference from TgAb, and good correlation with the Mayo Medical Laboratories procedure.",

This study aimed at evaluating CPSF2 protein expression as a prognostic marker for PTC in a region with a high prevalence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation, Korea.;This study included 159 patients with classical PTC who underwent a total thyroidectomy and received ablative doses of (131)I. The expression of CPSF2 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and graded semi-quantitatively. The presence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation was evaluated by direct sequencing.;Negative protein expression of CPSF2 was observed in 34 (21.3%) of the 159 PTCs. In multivariate analysis, negative CPSF2 expression was significantly associated with cervical lymph node metastasis (odds ratio [OR]=2.56, p=0.28), and distant metastasis (OR=3.48, p=0.02). After adjusting for age, sex, tumor size, extrathyroidal invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and the BRAF(V600E) mutation, the CPSF2-negative group had a significantly lower recurrence-free survival compared to the CPSF2-positive group (hazard ratio=2.14, p=0.03).;Negative protein expression of CPSF2 is independently associated with a poor clinical outcome in PTC.

Actually, derivatives belonging to this structural class show a large spectrum of activity, thus standing out as multi-target agents. Different PP compounds have been shown to act as: a) ABL inhibitors and antiproliferative agents against human leukemia cell lines; b) Src kinase inhibitors in neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma and osteosarcoma; c) Phospholipase D inhibitors in different neoplasias; d) Urokinase plasminogen activator inhibitors, in breast cancer. In thyroid cancer (TC), PP1 and PP2 (inhibitors of RET, Hck, lck, and fynT kinases, and a good inhibitor of c-Src and platelet-derived growth factor receptor) showed antineoplastic actvity in human papillary TC cell lines that carry spontaneous RET/PTC1 rearrangements. More recently, new derivatives, (R)-1-phenethyl-N-(1-phenylethyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4- amine, namely, CLM3 and CLM29, have been demonstrated to exert a multiple signal transduction inhibition (including the RET-TK, BRAF, EGFR, and with antiangiogenic activity), showing antineoplastic activity, in vitro and in vivo, in papillary dedifferentiated, medullary and anaplastic TC. These data have shown the antineoplastic activity of PP in different neoplasias, opening the way to a future clinical evaluation in human cancers. ",

However, the molecular function of KSR in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is unknown. Thus, this study aimed to characterize the role of KSR1 in patients with PTC. qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed inter-tumor heterogeneities in the expression of KSR1 in PTC tissues. Interestingly, BRAFV600E-positive PTC showed higher KSR1 mRNA expression than BRAFV600E-negative PTC (P<0.001). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using public repositories showed that high KSR1 expression coordinately upregulated Notch signaling (nominal P=0.019, false discovery rate (FDR) q-value=0.165); this finding was supported by GeneNetwork analysis, indicating that KSR1 expression is positively correlated with NOTCH1 expression (ρ=0.677, P=6.15×10(-9)). siRNA against KSR1 (siKSR1) significantly decreased ERK phosphorylation induced by BRAFV600E, resulting in reduced expression of NOTCH1 and HES1, targets of Notch signaling. GSEA revealed that high KSR1 expression was also associated with downregulation of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Consistent with this, electron microscopy showed that PTCs with high KSR1 expression exhibited structural defects of the mitochondrial cristae. Furthermore, siKSR1-transfected BCPAP and 8505C cells generated fewer colonies in colony-forming assays. In addition, GSEA showed that high expression of KSR2 and connector enhancer of KSR1 (CNKSR1) also coordinately upregulated Notch signaling (KSR2: nominal P=0.0097, FDR q-value=0.154 and CNKSR1: nominal P<0.0001, FDR q-value=0.00554), and high CNKSR2 was associated with downregulation of the OxPhos gene set (nominal P<0.0001, FDR q-value <0.0001). In conclusion, KSR1 is coordinately regulated with Notch signaling and OxPhos in PTC, because its scaffold function might be required to sustain the proliferative signaling and metabolic remodeling associated with this type of cancer.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) in the signal transduction leading to Erk activation in PTC cells. In normal thyroid cells, CaMKII and Erk were in the inactive form in the absence of stimulation. In primary PTC cultures and in PTC cell lines harboring the oncogenes RET/PTC-1 or BRaf(V600E), CaMKII was active also in the absence of any stimulation. Inhibition of calmodulin or phospholipase C (PLC) attenuated the level of CaMKII activation. Expression of recombinant RET/PTC-3, BRaf(V600E), or Ras(V12) induced CaMKII activation. Inhibition of CaMKII attenuated Erk activation and DNA synthesis in thyroid papillary carcinoma (TPC-1), a cell line harboring RET/PTC-1, suggesting that CaMKII is a component of the Erk signal cascade in this cell line. In conclusion, PTCs contain an active PLC/Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent signal inducing constitutive activation of CaMKII. This kinase is activated by BRaf(V600E), oncogenic Ras, and by RET/PTC. CaMKII participates to the activation of the Erk pathway by oncogenic Ras and RET/PTC and contributes to their signal output, thus modulating tumor cell proliferation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Therapy of thyroid cancers is based on the removal of the primary disease by surgery, replacement of the hormonal deficiencies and subsequent therapy of the recurrent and metastatic disease. The metabolic characteristics of many thyroid tumors mean that radionuclide techniques have been used in the identification of sites of tumour and their subsequent therapy. Differentiated thyroid cancers, papillary, follicular and mixed papillary follicular, are treated by surgery--usually a total or subtotal thyroidectomy. Postoperatively, patients have thyroxine as a replacement therapy and to suppress thyroid-stimulating hormone production. Radioiodine therapy is often given to ablate the thyroid remnant. This allows (a) adequate follow-up of patients using thyroglobulin measurements and assessment scans as necessary, and (b) further therapy with radioiodine for metastatic disease. Patients with a short effective half-life of radioiodide may require higher activities or pharmacological methods of prolonging the retention half-times of iodine. The use of chemotherapy in this group of tumors is limited and at best provides palliation. The overall prognosis is good for differentiated thyroid cancer; papillary carcinomas have an 80 to 90% 10-year survival, whereas follicular tumors are associated with a 65 to 75% 10-year survival. Medullary carcinomas may be sporadic or familial, and some of the latter form part of a multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome (MEN). Primary treatment is surgery, and total thyroidectomy is usually recommended since tumours are often multifocal. The use of radiolabelled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and 111In octreotide as potential therapeutic agents has been explored and may be potentially useful in palliative care. Chemotherapy is of limited benefit. The 10-year survival for medullary carcinomas is 60 to 70%. Anaplastic tumours of the thyroid are usually aggressive, with a high mortality. Treatment is palliative by surgical debulking; some patients may benefit from local radiotherapy or occasionally chemotherapy. The use of therapeutic doses of radionuclides is well tolerated, although it may be associated with a variety of mostly transient adverse effects, including gastritis, thyroiditis and sialadenitis. Therapy with high activities of radioiodine require radiation protection precautions. Despite retreatment with radioiodine there appear to be no long term effects on the fertility of patients, and healthy children are born to women receiving this treatment. 131I remains perhaps the most specific cancer therapy available today and has few adverse effects. It is difficult to see any marked improvement being developed for differentiated thyroid cancer, with the possible exception of targeted gene therapy.",

All 2464 patients were offered a thyroidectomy, and DNA was extracted from the atypical cells in the surgical specimens for detection of the BRAF (V600E) mutation. Clinical and pathological characteristics were also investigated.;Four hundred and fifty-two of 1945 (23.2%) patients were diagnosed with HT, and of these, 119 (72.1%) had a BRAF (V600E) mutation. HT was not significantly associated with the BRAF (V600E) mutation (P < 0.001) and extrathyroidal extensions (P = 0.005) but was associated with a low stage (P = 0.011) and female predominance (P < 0.001). In a subgroup analysis for gender, HT was associated with a low probability of BRAF (V600E) mutations in both genders (P < 0.001 for both females and males). Also, recurrence was significantly associated with HT (OR 0.297, CI 0.099-0.890, P = 0.030), lymph node ratio (OR 2.545, CI 1.092-5.931, P = 0.030), and BRAF (V600E) mutation (OR 2.075, CI 1.021-4.217, P = 0.044). However, there was no relationship with clinicopathological factors or with death.;Our results show that HT in patients with PTC is associated with a low probability of BRAF (V600E) mutations.

The present study was to further investigate and establish this role of CCDC67 in PTC.;The expression of CCDC67, both at mRNA and protein levels, was sharply down-regulated in PTC compared with normal thyroid tissues. Lower CCDC67 expression was significantly associated with aggressive tumor behaviors, such as advanced tumor stages and lymph node metastasis, as well as BRAF mutation. Introduced expression of CCDC67 in TPC-1 cells robustly inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation and migration, induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and increased cell apoptosis.;Primary PTC tumors and matched normal thyroid tissues were obtained from 200 unselected patients at the initial surgery for detection of CCDC67 mRNA and protein by RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses, respectively. Genomic DNA sequencing was performed to detect BRAF mutation in PTC tumors. Clinicopathological data were retrospectively reviewed for correlation analyses. PTC cell line TPC-1 with stable transfection of CCDC67 was used to investigate the functions of CCDC67.;This large study demonstrates down-regulation of CCDC67 in PTC, an inverse relationship between CCDC67 expression and PTC aggressiveness and BRAF mutation, and a robust inhibitory effect of CCDC67 on PTC cellular activities.

        "Doc_abstract":"Nuclear medicine is engaged with the detection of pathological processes with the help of radionuclides. An interesting approach is to target antigens, symporters, or receptors with diagnostic and therapeutic radionuclides. Different peptide receptors like somatostatin, bombesin/GRP or VIP are (over)expressed on cancer cells, and are therefore an ideal target for the diagnosis and therapy in nuclear medicine with radiolabeled peptides. The somatostatin analogue OctreoScan [octreotide coupled with diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate (DTPA)] can be labeled with In-111 and is widely used in nuclear oncology for the staging of different tumors (e.g., carcinoids). Other peptides like neurotensin, bombesin/GRP, and VIP are under (pre)clinical investigations. The staging of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) with the conventional radiological procedures is sometimes difficult. The high sensitivity of the pentagastrin stimulation test in detecting primary or metastatic MTC indicates the presence of tumor, but its localization is often not possible. This reaction of the tumor cells to the pentagastrin stimulation test suggests a widespread expression of the corresponding receptor type on human MTC. Indeed, autoradiographic studies demonstrated cholecystokinin (CCK)-B/gastrin receptors not only in over 90% of MTCs, but in a high percentage of small cell lung cancers, stromal ovarian, and potentially a variety of other tumors, including gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, and malignant glioma. The aim of our recent work was to develop and systematically optimize suitable radioligands for targeting CCK-B receptors in vivo and to investigate their role in the staging and therapy of MTC and other CCK-B receptor expressing malignancies. For this purpose, a variety of CCK/gastrin-related peptides, all having in common the C-terminal CCK receptor binding tetrapeptide sequence -Trp-Met-Asp-PheNH(2) or derivatives thereof, were investigated. They were members of the gastrin- or cholecystokinin families, or possessed characteristics of both, which differ by the intramolecular position of a tyrosyl moiety. Their stability and affinity were studied and optimized in vitro and in vivo; their biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy were tested in preclinical models. Best tumor uptake and tumor-to-nontumor ratios were obtained with members of the gastrin family, due to their superior selectivity and affinity for the CCK-B receptor subtype. Radiometal-labeled derivatives of minigastrin showed excellent targeting of CCK-B receptor expressing tissues in animals and healthy human volunteers. Preclinical therapy experiments in MTC-bearing animals showed significant antitumor efficacy. In a subsequent clinical study, 75 MTC patients with metastatic MTC were investigated; 43 suffered of known, 32 of occult disease. CCK-B receptor scintigraphy was performed with (111)In-DTPA-D-Glu(1)-minigastrin. The normal organ uptake was essentially confined to the stomach (and to a lower extent, to the gallbladder and, in premenopausal women, to normal breast tissue) as a result of CCK-B receptor specific binding, and to the kidneys as excretory organs. All tumor manifestations known from conventional imaging were visualized as early as 1 h p.i., with increasing tumor-to-background ratios over time; at least one lesion was detected in 29/32 patients with occult disease (patient-based sensitivity 91%). Among them were local recurrences, lymph node, pulmonary, hepatic, splenic, and bone (marrow) metastases. Eight patients with advanced metastatic disease were injected in a dose-escalation study with potentially therapeutic activities of a (90)Y-labeled minigastrin derivative at 4-6-weekly intervals (30-50 mCi/m(2) per injection for a maximum of four injections). Hematologic and renal were identified as the dose-limiting toxicities at the 40 and 50 mCi/m(2) levels. Two patients experienced partial remissions, 4 stabilization of their previously rapidly progressing disease. These data suggest that CCK-B receptor ligands may be a useful new class of receptor binding peptides for diagnosis and therapy of a variety of (CCK-B receptor expressing) tumor types. They allow for a sensitive and reliable staging of patients with metastatic MTC. Initial therapeutic results are promising, but nephrotoxicity is a major concern to be solved."},

        "Doc_abstract":"The introduction of PET(-CT) has brought about a major paradigm shift in the management of thyroid carcinoma, especially from the diagnostic standpoint. From the viewpoint of patient management, the areas where it has made significant impact include the following: (1) the detection of disease focus in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma with elevated Tg levels and negative radioiodine scan. When localized disease is identified with F-18 FDG-PET-CT, surgery or focused radiotherapy could be utilized to eradicate the tumor; (2) the localization of disease in patients of MTC with elevated serum calcitonin levels; (3) the detection of unsuspected focal F-18 FDG uptake in the thyroid in patients undergoing whole body F-18 FDG PET for a different indication. This would prompt a workup to rule out thyroid carcinoma. The use of I-124 is evolving at this time and has been of great promise with regard to (a) its better efficacy of lesion detection and (b) the ability to provide lesion-specific dosimetry. In addition, F-18 FDG PET appears to be of potential value in patients with thyroid lymphoma in making the initial diagnosis, monitoring therapeutic response, and assessing for residual disease and/or recurrence.",

No RAS gene mutation was found in hereditary MTC, and no BRAF or NRAS mutation was observed in any of the 50 samples.;Our study confirms that RAS mutations are frequent events in sporadic MTC.

Targeting RET, therefore, might be useful in tailoring surveillance of MTC patients. Here we showed that theaflavins, the bioactive components of black tea, successfully induced apoptosis in human MTC cell line, TT, by inversely modulating two molecular pathways: (i) stalling PI3K/Akt/Bad pathway that resulted in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) loss, cytochrome-c release and activation of the executioner caspases-9 and -3, and (ii) upholding p38MAPK/caspase-8/caspase-3 pathway via inhibition of Ras/Raf/ERK. Over-expression of either constitutively active myristoylated-Akt-cDNA (Myr-Akt-cDNA) or dominant-negative-caspase-8-cDNA (Dn-caspase-8-cDNA) partially blocked theaflavin-induced apoptosis, while co-transfection of Myr-Akt-cDNA and Dn-caspase-8-cDNA completely eradicated the effect of theaflavins thereby negating the possibility of existence of other pathways. A search for the upstream signaling revealed that theaflavin-induced disruption of lipid raft caused interference in anchorage of RET in lipid raft that in turn stalled phosphorylation of Ras and PI3Kinase. In such anti-survival cellular micro-environment, pro-apoptotic signals were triggered to culminate into programmed death of MTC cell. These findings not only unveil a hitherto unexplained mechanism underlying theaflavin-induced MTC death, but also validate RET as a promising and potential target for MTC therapy.",

The immunohistochemical calcitonin stain identified CCs easily, both inside SCNs and dispersed in islets at the periphery. For the characterization of MCs, we added the utility of p40 to p63. The use of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) helped in their identification, as MCs did not react with this marker; the combination of TTF-1 and p40 or p63 IHC stains was useful for the characterization of cystic SCNs of both types 3 and 4.

A functional IGF-I R is required for the cell to progress through the cell cycle. Most importantly, cells lacking this receptor cannot be transformed by any of a number of dominant oncogenes, a finding that proves that the presence of the IGF-I R is important for the development of a malignant phenotype. Consistent with this role, it has been well established that IGF-I can protect cells from apoptosis under a variety of circumstances. For example, IGF-I prevents apoptosis induced by overexpression of c-myc in fibroblasts, by interleukin-3 withdrawal in interleukin-3-dependent hemopoietic cells, etoposide, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, anti-cancer drugs, UV-B irradiations, and serum deprivation. While the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-I has been clearly demonstrated, the molecular mechanisms by which IGF-I inhibits apoptosis induced by these various stimuli remain unknown. We have previously documented increased IGF-I and IGF-I receptor immunoreactivity in human thyroid carcinomas with a corresponding up-regulation of IGF-I mRNA. Immunoreactivity for IGF-I and IGF-I receptor positively correlated with tumor diameter, but not with the occurrence of lymph node metastases.

Eligible patients had incurable solid tumours, were 18 years or older, and had adequate organ function. BRAF mutations were mandatory for inclusion later in the study because of an absence of activity in patients with wild-type BRAF. We used an accelerated dose titration method, with the first dose cohort receiving 12 mg dabrafenib daily in a 21-day cycle. Once doses had been established, we expanded the cohorts to include up to 20 patients. On the basis of initial data, we chose a recommended phase 2 dose. Efficacy at the recommended phase 2 dose was studied in patients with BRAF-mutant tumours, including those with non-Val600Glu mutations, in three cohorts: metastatic melanoma, melanoma with untreated brain metastases, and non-melanoma solid tumours. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00880321.;We enrolled 184 patients, of whom 156 had metastatic melanoma.

This study compares two independent groups of patients aiming to determine the frequency and the prognostic significance of CLT in patients with PTC.;From January 2005 to September 2013, we conducted a retrospective study on 160 patients with PTC who underwent thyroidectomy. CLT was diagnosed histopathologically.

Mean follow-up (metastasis, completeness-of-resection, serum thyroglobulin levels, tumor recurrence) period was 61 months (ranged from 18 to 132 months). A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.;Patients were divided in 2 groups. In group A there were 90 patients affected by PTC alone, and in group B there were 70 patients affected with PTC associated with CLT. Our data showed that the presence of CLT correlate with a lower grade of PTC (p < 0.05). Considering the sex of the patients there were a statistically significant correlation (p < 0.02) and the presence of CLT associated with PTC was most representative in female patients.;The presence of CLT in patients with PTC correlated with a lower grade of PTC, but it does not affect the overall survival of papillary thyroid cancers.",

Cytologic evaluation facilitates the diagnosis of thyroid lesions (TLs), but in 10-40% of cases the interpretation is indeterminate. Patients with indeterminate diagnoses are often treated with hemithyroidectomy followed by completion thyroidectomy, if cancer is found in the initial specimen. Exposing patients to multiple surgeries increases costs and morbidity. The American Thyroid Association states that a combination of molecular markers is likely to optimize the management of patients with indeterminate cytology. However, few studies have addressed the molecular alterations present in pediatric TL. Twenty-seven thyroid carcinomas from patients 10 to 19 years of age were tested for alterations common in adult TL, including BRAF V600E mutation, RET fusions, and TERT promoter mutations. Mutation-negative cases were subsequently analyzed with a next-generation sequencing (NGS) mutation panel to search for additional targets. Histologic diagnoses included 12 classic papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), 13 follicular variant PTCs, 1 medullary thyroid carcinoma, and 1 follicular carcinoma. Fourteen cases showed lymph node involvement, and 13 cases demonstrated lymphovascular invasion. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 10/27 cases, and RET fusions were detected in 6/27 cases. No TERT promoter mutations were identified in any of the cases. The NGS panel revealed additional RET and CTNNB1 pathogenic missense mutations. Our results demonstrate that molecular abnormalities are common in pediatric TLs and suggest that incorporation of molecular testing will be helpful in optimizing patient management. ",

Although partially effective in most cases, it can render a complete cure only in a limited number of patients. One way to enhance its efficacy would be to combine it with antineoplastic agents. Here we describe an initial in vitro evaluation with 4 thyroid cancer cell lines.;Cells were sparsely seeded in microtiter plates and allowed to grow for 2 days; then they were exposed to sublethal concentrations of cisplatin (CDDP), doxorubicin (Dox), or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), followed by treatment with I-131 for 48 hr. Cell survival was measured with a commercial kit based on the colorimetry of succinate dehydrogenase activity.;Chemotherapeutic drugs exerted similar concentration-dependent cytotoxic effects in all 4 cell lines. The doses necessary to reduce the surviving fraction to half of the control were about 3 microg/ml for CDDP, 0.3 microg/ml for Dox, and 3 microg/ml for 5-FU (when used continuously for 48 hours). On the other hand, sensitivity to I-131 irradiation differed among the lines; same doses (7.4-14.8 MBq/ml) caused the greatest damage in FRO cells, a modest effect in NPA and WRO, and only minimal change in B-CPAP. The combined effect was most demonstrable in wells treated with Dox and radioiodine, whereas the addition of CDDP or 5-FU had marginal or insignificant merit, respectively. In FRO cells, half-lethal doses of the above mentioned CDDP, Dox, and 5-FU, when used together with 14.8 MBq/ml I-131, reduced cell survival to 54.5%, 29.4% and 33.4%, respectively, vs. 60.2% with radioiodine alone.;In vitro, clinical concentrations of Dox can accelerate the killing of thyroid cancer cells by radioiodine. These favorable experimental results warrant future studies to evaluate whether this new bidisciplinary approach is clinically relevant and feasible.",

Twenty benign thyroid lesions and 10 PTC served as control cases. A high (47%) prevalence of RET/PTC rearrangements was found in HTT. By contrast, neither B-raf nor N-ras mutations were found in HTT. These findings suggest that, although RET/PTC, N-ras, and B-raf proteins may act along the same signalling cascade, the biological and morphological outcome of their oncogenic activation is not completely overlapping.

For each cytological category, we considered the definitive histological diagnosis of PTC and the presence of the BRAFV600E mutation. In 141 patients with a final tissue diagnosis of PTC, we correlated the presence of BRAFV600E with gender, age, histotype, TNM, size of the lesion, extracapsular extension, node metastases and multifocality.;The prevalence of the BRAFV600E mutation, among PTCs at final tissue diagnosis, was 69%. It improved the FNAB diagnostic accuracy from 88% to 91%. The BRAFV600E mutation was correlated with older age, classical variant of PTC, advanced stages in patients > 45 years.;BRAFV600E testing could play a role in improving the diagnostic accuracy of FNAB for PTC, representing a useful adjuvant tool in presurgical characterization of thyroid nodes in particular cases.

Standard therapy for most patients with localized differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) includes surgery, radioactive iodine, and thyroid hormone replacement. A minority of thyroid cancer patients requires systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Patients with metastatic DTC do not usually benefit from traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. In this review, we describe newly developed small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that are being actively tested and used in the management of advanced thyroid cancer. The use of TKIs as a form of molecular targeted therapy is evolving based on understanding of the pathways involved in DTC. Disrupting tumor vascular supply by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling is the most commonly used approach to treat advanced/metastatic DTC. Other mechanisms include targeting BRAF, MAPK/ERK kinase, or mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. Although TKIs appear to have superior efficacy compared to cytotoxic chemotherapy, they can cause substantial adverse effects; symptomatic management of adverse effects, dose adjustment, or cessation of therapy may be required.

We aimed to describe molecular markers in DTC that correlate with clinical outcome to axitinib. Pretreatment thyroid cancer blocks from 18 patients treated with axitinib were collected and genomic DNA was isolated. The OncoCarta™ Mutation Panel was used to test for 238 oncogenic mutations. Copy number of VEGFR1-3 and PIK3CA was determined using qPCR on enriched tumor samples. Genomic DNA was analyzed for all coding regions of VEGFR1-3 with custom primers. Protein expressions of VEGFR1-3, c-Met, and PIK3CA were evaluated with immunohistochemistry. Clinical response to axitinib, including best response (BR) and progression free survival (PFS), was ascertained from corresponding patients. Fisher's exact test and logistic regression models were used to correlate BR with molecular findings. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to correlate PFS with molecular defects. A total of 22 pathology samples (10 primary, 12 metastatic) were identified. In patients with 2 samples (n = 4), genetic results were concordant and only included once for analysis. Tumors from 4 patients (22%) harbored BRAF V600E mutations, 2 (11%) had KRAS mutations (G12A, G13D) and 2 (11%) had HRAS mutations (Q61R, Q61K). One metastatic sample with mutated KRAS also harbored a PIK3CA (H1047R) mutation. qPCR showed increased copy numbers of PIK3CA in 6 (33%) tumors, VEGFR1 in 0 (0%) tumors, VEGFR2 in 4 (22%) tumors, and VEGFR3 in 6 (33%) tumors. VEGFR sequencing was significant for a possibly damaging non-synonymous SNP in VEGFR2 (G539R) in 2 samples (11%), a possibly damaging SNP in VEGFR3 (E350V) in 1 sample (6%), and a potentially novel mutation in VEGFR2 (T439I) in 2 samples (11%). Immunohistochemistry (VEGFR1, -2, -3; c-MET; PIK3CA) revealed positive staining in the majority of samples. No significant relationship was seen between BR or PFS and the presence of molecular alterations. Molecular evaluation of DTC specimens did not predict clinical response to axitinib but our data were limited by sample size. We did identify molecular changes in VEGFR that should be further explored. While DTC is genetically heterogeneous, primary and metastatic lesions showed identical oncogenic alterations in four cases. ",

Twenty-five PTCs (11 with BRAF(V600E), 4 with RET/PTC1, and 10 without mutation in HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, RET/PTC1, or RET/PTC3) were analyzed using Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 which allows us to detect copy number alteration (CNA) and uniparental disomy (UPD), also referred to as copy neutral loss of heterozygosity, in a single experiment. The Japanese PTCs showed relatively stable karyotypes. Seven cases (28%) showed CNA(s), and 6 (24%) showed UPD(s). Interestingly, CNA and UPD were rarely overlapped in the same tumor; the only one advanced case showed both CNA and UPD with a highly complex karyotype. Thirteen (52%) showed neither CNA nor UPD. Regarding CNA, deletions tended to be more frequent than amplifications. The most frequent and recurrent region was the deletion in chromosome 22; however, it was found in only 4 cases (16%). The degree of genomic instability did not depend on the oncogene status. However, in oncogene-positive cases (BRAF(V600E) and RET/PTC1), tumors with CNA/UPD were less frequent (5/15, 33%), whereas tumors with CNA/UPD were more frequent in oncogene-negative cases (7/10, 70%), suggesting that chromosomal aberrations may play a role in the development of PTC, especially in oncogene-negative tumors. These data suggest that Japanese PTCs may be classified into three distinct groups: CNA(+), UPD(+), and no chromosomal aberrations.

Our present aim was to determine the efficacy of one such antibody, anti-B-Raf (V600E), a mouse monoclonal antibody in which the immunogen is a synthetic peptide derived from the internal region of BRAFV600E. A total of 35 cases of primary cutaneous melanoma were evaluated using a combination of DNA-based techniques that included allele-specific PCR and/or direct DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry. Cases of papillary thyroid carcinomas (n=5) and colorectal carcinomas (n=5), known to harbor the BRAFV600E mutation, served as positive controls for the study. DNA analyses revealed that 6 of 35 (17%) cases of the primary cutaneous malignant melanoma possessed the BRAFV600E mutation. For immunohistochemical analyses, cytoplasmic positivity with anti-B-Raf was noted in 7 of 35 (20%) cases of primary melanoma and in all 10 positive controls.

The present study has investigated the expression, subcellular localization, phosphorylation, and activity of p38-MAPKs in normal and tumoural human thyroid tissues and in thyroid cell lines. The expression and nucleo-cytosolic compartmentalization of the alpha-isoform of p38-MAPKs (p38alpha-MAPK) were studied by western blotting in the WRO and B-CPAP cell lines, which are derived from human follicular and papillary thyroid carcinomas, respectively, and in the non-transformed rat thyroid cell lines FRTL-5 and PCCL3. Immunohistochemistry was used to study the expression and subcellular localization of p38alpha-MAPK, and of the phosphorylated forms of p38-MAPKs (P-p38-MAPKs) in human toxic adenomas (TAs), follicular adenomas (FAs), papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), and follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs). The activity of p38-MAPKs in PTCs and FTCs was revealed by immunohistochemical detection of their typical phosphorylated substrate, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2/3 (MK2/3). p38alpha-MAPK was expressed in all cell lines and this expression was restricted to the cytosolic compartment. p38 MAPK activity was involved in regulating DNA synthesis in B-CPAP cells. p38alpha-MAPK and P-p38-MAPKs were strongly expressed in PTC and FTC cells, although only in the cytoplasm, whereas they were only very weakly expressed in FA cells, and absent in adjacent normal tissues. They were also expressed at a high level in TAs, but they were found in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Finally, phospho-MK2/3 immunostaining followed very similar patterns to those of p38alpha-MAPK and P-p38-MAPKs in PTCs and FTCs. Taken together, these results show for the first time that the p38-MAPK signalling cascade is functional in two types of differentiated carcinoma of the thyroid. The observation that p38-MAPK hyper-expression occurs in FTC, but not in FA, may provide an additional diagnostic tool for malignancy in some thyroid nodules.",

Final diagnoses were acquired in 327 nodules after surgery and clinico-radiological follow-up. The AUS group and FLUS group were compared in terms of US features (composition, echogenicity, margin, shape, and calcifications), US diagnosis (probably benign, malignant), malignancy rate, and final malignant histology.;In univariate and multivariate analysis, the AUS group more frequently had non-circumscribed margins, taller-than-wide shape, and an US diagnosis suggestive for malignancy than the FLUS group did. The risk of malignancy was significantly higher in the AUS group than it was in the FLUS group (51.0% vs.8.1%; p < 0.001). There was a significant difference in the presence of a BRAF mutation between the AUS group and the FLUS group (47.6% vs. 4.2%; p < 0.001). Of the patients with malignancy, papillary thyroid carcinoma was found more frequently in the AUS group than in the FLUS group (97.7% vs. 66.7%; p = 0.004). The incidence of follicular thyroid carcinoma was significantly higher in the FLUS group than it was in the AUS group (33.3% vs.1.6%; p = 0.004).;Bethesda System category III subcategorization into AUS and FLUS can be supported by US features.

Doctors and medical technicians in the Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine of Fukushima Medical University Hospital are participating in this program as administrators, examiners, and instructors. In the first preliminary survey from October, 2011 to March, 2012 for residents in highly contaminated areas, A2 judgment, defined as cysts of < or = 20.0 mm or nodules < or = 5.0 mm in diameter, and B judgment, defined as cysts or nodules larger than A2 were found in 35.8% and 0.5%, respectively. In second preliminary survey until March, 2013, A2 and B judgments were identified in 44.6% and 0.7% of residents in intermediately contaminated areas. A secondary examination for young residents who were judged as B or C identified 28 cases of malignancy or suspected malignancy.

Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using antibodies against several intracellular transducers. The effect of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition was assessed in vitro onto TT cells by means of methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium and Western blot assays.;BRAF, K-, H-, and N-RAS, and PI3 kinase mutations were absent in all cases examined. Germline RET mutations were detected in 20% of cases overall, whereas somatic RET mutations represented 53% of sporadic tumors. RET mutational status was associated to age, presence of multifocal tumors, and nodal status, but not disease outcome. Protein expression of markers investigated was highly heterogeneous, with a strong association between phospho-mTOR, phospho-AKT, and phospho-p70S6K, positively correlated to the presence of germline RET mutations. Moreover, selective mTOR inhibition affected cell proliferation of RET-mutant TT cells.;Taken together, our findings indicate that mTOR intracellular signaling pathway is functionally activated in MTC with a preferential expression in cases with germline RET mutations; genes downstream to RET tyrosine kinase such as BRAF, RAS isoforms, and PI3 kinase are not mutated in MTC.",

We previously observed that IRs are overexpressed in thyroid cancer cells; now we evaluated whether these cells preferentially express IR-A and produce IGF-II, which would activate a growth-promoting autocrine loop. The IR content ranged 6.0-52.6 ng/100 microg cell membrane protein in thyroid cancer primary cultures (n = 8) and permanent cell lines (n = 6) vs. 1.2-1.7 in normal thyroid cells (n = 11 primary cultures; P < 0.0001). IR-A isoform relative abundance ranged from 36-79% in cancer cells (with the highest values in undifferentiated cancers) vs. 27-39% in normal cells. Similar results were obtained in normal vs. cancer thyroid tissue specimens. IGF-II caused IR autophosphorylation with an ED(50) of 1.5-40.0 nM in cancer cells vs. more than 100 nM in normal cells; IGF-II affinity correlated with the relative abundance of IR-A (r = 0.628; P < 0.0001). IGF-II was expressed in all cancer cells, highly expressed in anaplastic cells, and less expressed in normal cells.

Recently, activating mutations in the B-RAF gene, an important activator of this pathway, have been described in several tumor types including melanoma, colorectal and papillary thyroid cancer. The most frequent mutation in exon 15 (V599E), as well as several other mutations within exons 11 and 15 result in constitutive activation of the oncoprotein. In addition, a significant association between mismatch-repair (MMR) deficiency and the V599E mutation in colorectal tumors has been found. The aim of our study was to investigate B-RAF mutations in 121 urothelial carcinomas of the urinary bladder (ranging from pTaG1 to pT4aG3) and 27 tumors from the upper urinary tract (UUT), including 16 tumors of the renal pelvis and 11 tumors of the ureter). Twelve of 27 UUT tumors were MMR-deficient and showed microsatellite instability. The V599E mutation was screened for by allele-specific PCR (PASA) and exons 11 and 15 of B-RAF including intron-exon-boundaries were sequenced. Overall, 116/121 bladder tumors and 23/27 tumors of the UUT were successfully investigated by PASA. None of the tumors showed the V599E mutation. Sequence analysis of exons 11 and 15 was successful in 46 urothelial tumors (bladder, n=31; UUT, n=15). No mutations within the coding region of exons 11 and 15 and the intron-exon junctions were found.

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of CNA profiles revealed a significant enrichment of a subgroup of patients with female gender, long latency (>17 years) and negative lymph node status. Further, we identified single CNAs that were significantly associated with latency, gender, radiation dose and BRAF V600E mutation status. Multivariate analysis revealed no interactions but additive effects of parameters gender, latency and dose on CNAs. The previously identified radiation-associated gain of the chromosomal bands 7q11.22-11.23 was present in 29% of cases. Moreover, comparison of our radiation-associated PTC data set with the TCGA data set on sporadic PTCs revealed altered copy numbers of the tumor driver genes NF2 and CHEK2. Further, we integrated the CNA data with transcriptomic data that were available on a subset of the herein analyzed cohort and did not find statistically significant associations between the two molecular layers.

With the aim of updating the use of Thyrogen, we report 7 cases which were treated with Thyrogen for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. All 7 patients were thyroidectomised and radioiodine ablated and all had detectable [> 1 ng/ml] basal serum thyroglobulin (b-Tg) levels. Thyrogen stimulation resulted in a rise of Tg (s-Tg) in all patients. Five patients had negative whole body scanning (WBS) and no clinical or radiological signs of disease. Two patients with a b-Tg value of 5 ng/ml and 11 ng/ml, respectively showed a s-Tg of 17 ng/ml and 84 ng/ml, respectively, whereas WBS was negative. Both of these patients received 100 mCi (3700 MBq) 131I. Owo patients had a positive Tg and positive WBS with skull, lung and hepatic metastases and received 150 131I after preparation with Thyrogen. Six months later one of these patients was free of disease and the other will be evaluated during the coming months. In conclusion, Thyrogen emerges as a reliable and safe agent for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. Furthermore, it appears that Thyrogen could be used in the treatment of metastases as an alternative to thyroid hormone withdrawal.",

CCK-B/gastrin receptors were found frequently in medullary thyroid carcinomas (92%), in small cell lung cancers (57%), in astrocytomas (65%), and in stromal ovarian cancers (100%). They were found occasionally in gastroenteropancreatic tumors, breast, endometrial, and ovarian adenocarcinomas. They were either not expressed or rarely expressed in colorectal cancers, differentiated thyroid cancers, non-small cell lung cancers, meningiomas, neuroblastomas, schwannomas, glioblastomas, lymphomas, renal cell cancers, prostate carcinomas, and the remaining neuroendocrine tumors (i.e., pituitary adenomas, pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, and parathyroid adenomas). CCK-A receptors were expressed rarely in tumors except in gastroenteropancreatic tumors (38%), meningiomas (30%), and some neuroblastomas (19%). The identified CCK-A and CCK-B receptors were specific and of high affinity in the subnanomolar range. The rank order of potency of various CCK analogues was: sulfated CCK-8 = L-364,718 >> nonsulfated CCK-8 = L-365,260 > or = gastrin for CCK-A receptors and sulfated CCK-8 > gastrin = nonsulfated CCK-8 > L-365,260 > L-364,718 for CCK-B receptors. CCK-B receptors could also be selectively and specifically labeled with a newly designed nonsulfated 125I-(D-Tyr-Gly, Nle28,31)-CCK 26-33. Gastrin mRNA measured by in situ hybridization was present in most CCK-B receptor-positive small cell lung cancers, breast tumors, and ovarian tumors, representing the molecular basis of a possible autocrine growth regulation of these tumors. Gastrin and CCK mRNAs were lacking in medullary thyroid cancers. Thus, these results may have pathogenic, diagnostic, differential diagnostic, and therapeutic implications.",

Specifically, by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) we evaluated TAZ mRNA levels in tissue specimens (n=61) of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and herein we show that the PTC samples express much higher TAZ mRNA levels with respect to the normal thyroid tissue (p<0.001). TAZ expression was also evaluated in normal (n=10) and pathological human thyroids (n=17) by immunohistochemical analysis and the increase of TAZ protein levels in PTC was confirmed. To further analyse the molecular mechanisms underlying TAZ overexpression in PTC, we used an inducible system consisting of FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells expressing a conditional RAS oncoprotein and we show that the activation of the RAS signalling pathway is involved in TAZ deregulation. These observations suggest that the activated effectors of the RAS/RAF/MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) signalling pathway are involved in the increased expression of TAZ, supporting the idea that this may also occur in thyroid papillary carcinoma. Moreover, we demonstrated that the overexpression of TAZ is able to confer growth advantage to thyroid cells in culture and to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, these findings support a potential role for TAZ in the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinomas.",

However, it can also occur sporadically. The molecular pathogenesis of sporadic CMV-PTC is not completely understood. We report cases of 3 patients with sporadic CMV-PTC with PIK3CA mutations. Using sequencing analyses and immunohistochemistry, we examined KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and CTNNB1 mutations and related proteins, including β-catenin, PTEN, CD10, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, cytokeratin 19, and cyclin D1 in 3 CMV-PTCs. The 3 patients were teenaged girls. The tumors were solitary and encapsulated without cervical lymph node metastasis. They showed no recurrence for more than 6 years after the operation. Three tumors were diffusely positive for β-catenin, cyclin D1, and PTEN. The biphasic immunohistochemical patterns between the morular and nonmorular components were identified; the nonmorular components were positive for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and cytokeratin 19, whereas the morular components showed CD10 positivity. All tumors harbored the same mutation in exon 9, codon 545 of the PIK3CA gene (p.E545A), whereas the KRAS, BRAF, and CTNNB1 mutations were not detected. This is the first study identifying the PIK3CA mutation specifically in sporadic CMV-PTC.

The pathological archives at the Johns Hopkins Hospital were searched for metastatic PTC. A total of 247 cases were identified; four cases were found to have metastases to the liver. Three of these cases were available for molecular testing to determine BRAF V600E status. All patients were female with ages ranging from 39- to 66-years old. Local lymph node involvement was found in all patients at the time of thyroidectomy. The average time of liver metastasis discovery following thyroidectomy was 16 years. The cytomorphology revealed predominantly microacini or two-dimensional clusters. Tumor cells were small-to-intermediate in size with oval nuclei, fine chromatin, nuclear grooves, rare intranuclear pseudoinclusions, and mitoses. In all cases, immunohistochemical stains for thyroglobulin and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) were positive. All these tested cases were negative for the BRAF V600E mutation. The differential diagnosis includes adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine neoplasms. The most important morphologic features for diagnosing PTC are the presence of pale finely granular chromatin, nuclear grooves, and intranuclear pseudoinclusions.

Twelve papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) without ETE and NMP were also analyzed. Cases with paraffin tissues were subjected to mass spectrometry genotyping encompassing the most significant oncogenes in TC: 111 mutations in RET, BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, PIK3CA, and AKT1, and other related genes were surveyed.;Eighty-one (10%) of 829 patients in the database had ETE and no NMP. There was a much higher frequency of poorly differentiated and anaplastic carcinomas (12/29, 41%) in patients with gross ETE than in those with METE (3/52, 6%) (p < 0.01). There was a higher disease-specific survival (DSS) in patients with METE than in those with gross ETE (p < 0.0001). Except for an anaplastic case, no recurrences were detected in 45 patients with METE, including 23 PTC patients followed up for a median of 10 years without radioactive iodine therapy. Within patients with gross invasion into trachea/esophagus, tumors with high mitotic activity and/or tumor necrosis correlated with worse DSS (p < 0.05). Fifty-six cases with ETE were genotyped as follows: BRAFV600E, 39 (70%); BRAFV600E-AKT1, 1 (1.8%); NRAS, 1 (1.8%); KRAS, 1 (1.8%); RET/PTC, 3 (5%); wild type, 11 (19.6%). Within PTCs, BRAF positivity rate increased the risk of ETE (p = 0.01). If PTC follicular variants are excluded, BRAF positivity does not correlate with ETE status within classical/tall cell PTC.;(i) PTCs with METE without NMP have an extremely low recurrence rate in contrast to tumors with gross ETE. (ii) High mitotic activity and/or tumor necrosis confers worse DSS even in patients stratified for gross ETE in trachea/esophagus.

We confirmed already described up-regulations of microRNAs in PTC, such as miR-146b-5p or miR-222-3p, but we also identified down-regulated microRNAs, such as miR-7-5p or miR-30c-2-3p. We showed that these down-regulations are linked to the tumorigenesis process of thyrocytes. We selected the 14 most down-regulated microRNAs in PTC and we showed that they are potential biomarkers of PTC samples. Nevertheless, they can distinguish histological classical variants and follicular variants of PTC in the TCGA dataset. In addition, 12 of the 14 down-regulated microRNAs are significantly less expressed in aggressive PTC compared to non-aggressive PTC. We showed that the associated aggressive expression profile is mainly due to the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation. In general, primary tumors and LNM presented similar microRNA expression profiles but specific variations like the down-regulation of miR-7-2-3p and miR-30c-2-3p in LNM were observed. Investigations of the 5p-to-3p arm expression ratios, non-templated additions or isomiRs distributions revealed no major implication in PTC tumorigenesis process or LNM appearance.;Our results showed that down-regulated microRNAs can be used as new potential common biomarkers of PTC and to distinguish main subtypes of PTC. MicroRNA expressions can be linked to the development of LNM of PTC. The bioinformatics framework that we have developed can be used as a starting point for the global analysis of any microRNA deep-sequencing data in an unbiased way.",

The widespread application of the next-generation sequencing technologies in cancer genomics research provides novel insights into determining the clonal relationship between multiple tumours within the same thyroid gland. For eight MPTC patients, we performed whole-exome sequencing and targeted region sequencing to identify the non-synonymous point mutations and gene rearrangements of distinct and spatially separated tumour foci. Among these eight MPTCs, completely discordant mutational spectra were observed in the distinct cancerous nodules of patients MPTC1 and 5, suggesting that these nodules originated from independent precursors. In another three cases (MPTC2, 6, and 8), the distinct MPTC foci of these patients had no other shared mutations except BRAF V600E, also indicating likely independent origins. Two patients (MPTC3 and 4) shared almost identical mutational spectra amongst their separate tumour nodules, suggesting a common clonal origin. MPTC patient 7 had seven cancer foci, of which two foci shared 66.7% of mutations, while the remaining cancer foci displayed no common non-synonymous mutations, indicating that MPTC7 has multiple independent origins accompanied by intraglandular disease dissemination. In this study, we found that 75% of MPTC cases arose as independent tumours, which supports the field cancerization hypothesis describing multiple malignant lesions. MPTC may also arise from intrathyroidal metastases from a single malignant clone, as well as multiple independent origins accompanied by intrathyroidal metastasis.",

The molecular mechanism that contributes to low NIS expression is not well understood. Activated NIS gene expression is stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone-mediated cAMP/protein kinase A signaling through a NIS upstream enhancer (NUE). The cAMP pathway is also stimulated by forskolin. In the current work, we studied the mechanism of transcriptional activation of NIS in normal thyroid cells and thyroid cancer cells. We identified the cAMP response element modulator (CREM) activator as a new component of the transcription complex that is important for NIS gene expression. The CREM complex is seen in the normal thyroid cells and BRAF (V600E) thyroid cancer cells (BHP 17-10) but is missing in rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid carcinoma-1 rearrangement thyroid cancer cells (BHP 2-7). This complex is believed to be responsible for the loss of NUE activity and reduced NIS expression in the BHP 2-7 cell line. In BHP 2-7 cells, forskolin stimulated the thyroid-specific transcription factor Pax 8, but CREM activator mRNA did not increase, and this produced a small increase in NUE activity. Ectopic expression of CREM activator enhanced activity of the NUE, indicating that CREM is an essential regulator of NIS gene expression.",

Although neither PPFP;Cre nor PtenFF;Cre mice develop thyroid tumors, the combined PPFP;PtenFF;Cre mice develop metastatic thyroid cancer, consistent with patient data that PPFP is occasionally found in benign thyroid adenomas and that PPFP carcinomas have increased phosphorylated AKT/protein kinase B.

However, the thyroids in pioglitazone-fed PPFP;PtenFF;Cre mice decreased 7-fold in size, and metastatic disease was prevented. Remarkably, pioglitazone caused an adipogenic response in the PPFP;PtenFF;Cre thyroids characterized by lipid accumulation and the induction of a broad array of adipocyte PPARγ target genes. These data indicate that, in the presence of pioglitazone, PPFP has PPARγ-like activity that results in trans-differentiation of thyroid carcinoma cells into adipocyte-like cells. Furthermore, the data predict that pioglitazone will be therapeutic in patients with PPFP-positive carcinomas.",

While demonstrated to be effective anticancer agents, B-Raf or MEK inhibitors have also been associated with early tumor progression and development of secondary neoplasms. The ligation of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) with its receptor, death receptor 5 (DR5), leading to induction of apoptosis, offers a promising anticancer strategy. Importantly, this is also a natural immunosurveillance mechanism against cancer development. We previously demonstrated that activated B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling positively regulates DR5 expression. Hence, our current work sought to address whether B-Raf/MEK/ERK inhibition and the consequent suppression of DR5 expression impede cancer cell response to DR5 activation-induced apoptosis and activated immune cell-induced killing. We found that both B-Raf (for example, PLX4032) and MEK inhibitors (for example, AZD6244 and PD0325901) effectively inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation and reduced DR5 levels in both human thyroid cancer and melanoma cells. Similar to the observed effect of genetic knockdown of the B-Raf gene, pre-treatment of cancer cell lines with either B-Raf or MEK inhibitors attenuated or abolished cellular apoptotic response induced by TRAIL or the DR5 agonistic antibody AMG655 or cell killing by activated T cells. Our findings clearly show that inhibition of B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling suppresses DR5 expression and impairs DR5 activation-induced apoptosis and T cell-mediated killing of cancer cells. These findings suggest a potential negative impact of B-Raf or MEK inhibition on TRAIL- or DR5-mediated anticancer therapy and on TRAIL/DR5-mediated immune-clearance of cancer cells. ",

Eleven cases were also tested for PAX8/PPARγ translocations. The lymphomas included 25 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, 6 extranodal marginal-zone lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type, and 2 follicular lymphomas. Seventeen diffuse large B-cell lymphomas were germinal center type, six non-germinal center type, and two unclassifiable (Hans algorithm). None of the cases had an associated thyroid carcinoma. Mutations of the BRAF gene were identified in six (24%) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (D594G in three germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, K601N in two germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, and V600E in one non-germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) and of the NRAS gene in two (8%) non-germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (Q61K and Q61H). BRAF and NRAS mutations were not found in any extranodal marginal-zone lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type or follicular lymphomas. HRAS and KRAS mutations were not identified in any of the cases, nor were PAX8/PPARγ translocations found. Thus, interpretation of finding a BRAF or NRAS mutation in the thyroid, particularly in preoperative thyroid aspirates, must take into account the differential diagnosis of a lymphoma.

Follicular variant (FV) papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has aggressive biologic behavior as compared to classic variant (CV) of PTC and frequently metastasizes to the lungs and bones. However, metastasis to the pancreas is extremely rare manifestation of FV-PTC. To date, only 9 cases of PTC have been reported in the literature. Pancreatic metastases from PTC usually remain asymptomatic or manifest as repeated abdominal aches. Associated obstructive jaundice is rare. Prognosis is variable with reported median survival from 16 to 46 months. Case Presentation. Herein we present a 67-year-old Saudi woman, who developed pancreatic metastases seven years after total thyroidectomy and neck dissection followed by radioactive iodine ablation (RAI) for FV-PTC. Metastasectomy was performed by pancreaticoduodenectomy followed by sorafenib as genetic testing revealed a BRAF V600E mutation. She survived 32 months after the pancreatic metastasis diagnosis. Conclusion. Pancreatic metastases are rare manifestation of FV-PTC and are usually sign of extensive disease and conventional diagnostic tools may remain to reach the diagnosis.",

In the proposed approach, a biotinylated 30-nucleotides probe DNA was immobilized in a streptavidin-modified 96-well microtiter plate and the free active sites of the streptavidin were blocked using biotinylated bovine serum albumin (BSA). The biotinylated target DNA was then added and allowed to hybridize with the immobilized probe DNA for 30min. Subsequently, streptavidin-labeled gold nanoparticles were added, and a nanoparticle enlargement process was performed using gold ion solution and formaldehyde reductant. The gold particles were then dissolved in bromide and DNA hybridization detection process was performed using a square wave stripping voltammetry (SWSV) technique. The results indicated a stable SWSV response in differential detection between blank solution and target DNA solution with a concentration of 130aM. Moreover, the coefficient of determination (R(2)) of the semi-log plot of the SWSV response current against the target DNA concentration (0.52-1300aM) was found to be 0.9982. The detection limit was estimated to be 0.35aM (based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1). This value was approximately three orders of magnitude lower than that obtained using the same method but without gold amplification process. Finally, the proposed approach is successful in differentiating between the mutant and wildtype BRAF sequences that are present in genuine 224-nucleotides DNA.",

Malignant transformation is known to occur, usually as classical papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). However, the recognition of follicular variant PTC raises the possibility of similar malignancy arising in struma ovarii. We examined 13 cases of struma ovarii to determine if these lesions can exhibit histological, immunohistochemical, and/or molecular features of follicular variant PTC. Ten of these had atypical histology, cytologic features of PTC, and all ten showed diffuse positivity for CK19; eight of these were also positive for HMBE-1. Mutational analysis for BRAF identified no V600E mutations. However, seven of the ten cases with features of follicular variant PTC exhibited a rearranged in transformation (RET)/PTC rearrangement by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The three cases considered to be benign based on histologic and cytologic criteria were negative for CK19 and HBME-1 by immunohistochemistry, and had no evidence of BRAF mutation or ret/PTC-1 and ret/PTC-3 rearrangements. These results indicate that follicular variant PTC can occur in struma ovarii and that such lesions exhibit the same morphologic and immunohistochemical profile as follicular variant PTC in thyroid. The application of molecular testing to verify the diagnosis can be valuable, as these lesions may harbor ret/PTC gene rearrangements.",

To lower the overall incidence of this false-negative testing, new reporting systems encourage the molecular testing of thyroid nodules. However, to the authors' knowledge, the role of molecular testing in false-negative FNA has not yet been evaluated.;In total, 1347 consecutive papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) with both cytological and histological diagnoses were collected from the same center. A blinded revision of the false-negative cases was performed. An analysis of the BRAF and Ras genes in the false-negative cases was then performed.;The false-negative rate at the time of primary FNA diagnosis was 4.8% (65 of 1347 cases). False-negative cases were 15 follicular variant PTCs, 2 classical variant, and 1 solid variant that lacked peculiar PTC cytomorphological features. Adequate cellular material for molecular analysis was available only in 54 of the 65 false-negative cases. Mutations were found in 6 cases (11%), and Ras alterations were present in 16 cases (29.6%). The addition of molecular analysis decreased the false-negative rate to 0.4% (5 of 1347 cases).;The results of the current study confirm the feasibility of BRAF and Ras analysis in routine FNA. However, when the false-negative FNA rate is low, the cost-benefit analysis of the detection of BRAF and Ras mutations should be carefully evaluated. Consequently, the authors suggest that preoperative molecular assessment could be helpful for benign nodules, but only in the presence of clinical suspicion of malignancy.",

Mutations targeting the RAS family of oncogenes were the most frequently observed class of alterations, present in 36% (46 of 127) of cases, followed by BRAF mutation, present in 30% (38 of 127). We also detected oncogenic rearrangements not previously associated with FVPTC, including TFG-ALK and CREB3L2-PPARγ. BRAF mutation was significantly associated with unencapsulated tumor status.;These data support the hypothesis that FVPTC is composed of distinct biological entities, with one class being identified by BRAF mutation and support the use of clinical genotyping assays that detect a diverse array of rearrangements involving ALK and PPARγ. Additional studies are necessary to identify genetic drivers in the 30% of FVPTCs with no known oncogenic alteration and to better predict behavior in tumors with known genotypes.",

OBJECTIVES To define the relative risk of PTC in patients with CM, and vice versa, and their first- through fifth-degree relatives and spouses by using a unique population research database; and to assess the rate of BRAF v600e mutation in a group of patients with both diagnoses. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective rev iew using the Utah Population Database (which is linked to medical records and the Utah Cancer Registry from 1966 to 2011) and tissue analysis in a tertiary care facility. Included were 4460 patients diagnosed with PTC and 14 569 with CM in Utah between 1966 and 2011 and their first- through fifth-degree relatives and spouses. These were compared at a 5:1 ratio with matched, population-based controls. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Statistically significant increased risk of PTC in patients with CM, and vice versa, and any first- through fifth-degree relatives and spouses; and a significantly higher rate of BRAF v600e mutation in patients with both PTC and CM than would be expected for each individual condition alone. RESULTS Patients with CM had a 2.3-fold increased risk (P < .001) of being diagnosed as having PTC compared with population-based matched controls. Conversely, patients with PTC had a 1.8-fold increased risk (P < .001) of developing CM. First- through fifth-degree relatives and spouses of patients with PTC or CM did not show a statistically significant increased risk. Eight patients with both cancer diagnoses had tissue specimens tested, of which 4 (50%) were found to be positive for the BRAF v600e mutation in either their PTC or CM specimen, and 3 (38%) were found positive in both. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with either PTC or CMhave an increased risk of developing the other cancer as a second primary malignant neoplasm. Tissue specimens from patients with both cancers show a high rate of BRAF v600e mutation. Translational studies are needed to better define the associated genetic predisposition between PTC and CM and to test the efficacy of and implementation techniques for treatment plans using BRAF mutation as a therapeutic target.",

Galectin-3 immunostaining and molecular analyses for BRAF and three RAS genes (NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS) were performed.;FNAC diagnoses of FVPTC included benign (5%), atypia of undetermined significance (19%), follicular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm (14%), suspicious for PTC (29%), and PTC (34%). Galectin-3 immunostaining was positive in 50% of FNAC specimens. A BRAF mutation was found only in 14 (24%) tumors with the FNAC diagnosis of PTC or suspicious for PTC: 13 cases with the usual c.1799T>A (p.V600E) mutation and 1 case with a 3 base-pair deletion (c.1799_1801delTGA), resulting in a deletion of lysine at codon 601 and a deletion c.1799_1801delTGA that results in a valine-to-glutamate substitution at codon 600 (p.V600_K601>E) while preserving the reading frame. A BRAF K601E mutation was not found. RAS mutations were observed in 18 (33%) tumors (NRAS, 22%; HRAS, 6%; KRAS, 6%). Mutations of the three RAS genes were detected in codon 61 but not in codons 12 and 13. There was a decreasing trend of RAS mutation rates associated with an increasing risk of malignancy in the FNAC diagnostic categories. The triage efficacy of FNAC to make a recommendation for surgery was 73% for encapsulated tumors and 79% for infiltrative tumors. Addition of galectin-3 or the BRAF test to FNAC showed no significant improvement in the triage efficacy. However, RAS mutations significantly improved the triage efficacy of FNAC. There was no significant difference in the triage efficacy of FNAC, galectin-3 expression, and the prevalence of somatic mutations between encapsulated and infiltrative tumors.;Thyroid FNAC has a low sensitivity for the detection of FVPTC regardless of histologic subtype. Encapsulated FVPTC and infiltrative FVPTC have similar molecular profiles and rates of galectin-3 expression. RAS mutational analysis is more useful than BRAF testing to improve the triage efficacy of FNAC for FVPTC.",

FASN is overexpressed in variety of human cancers, but its role has not been elucidated in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).;Our objective was to investigate the role of FASN and its relationship with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT activation in a large series of PTC in a tissue microarray format followed by studies using PTC cell lines and Nude mice.;Analysis of apoptosis and cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation assays. FASN and phospho-AKT protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting.;Our data show that expression of FASN is associated with activated AKT (phospho-AKT) in a subset of PTC. Treatment of PTC cell lines (NPA-187, ONCO-DG-1, and B-CPAP) with C-75, an inhibitor of FASN, suppresses growth and induces apoptosis in all cell lines. Treatment of PTC cells with C-75 or expression of FASN small interfering RNA causes down-regulation of FASN and inactivation of AKT activity. Furthermore, treatment of PTC cell lines with C-75 results in apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway involving the proapoptotic factor Bad, activation of Bax, activation of caspases, and down-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins. Finally, treatment of NPA-187 xenografts with C-75 results in growth inhibition of tumors in Nude mice via down-regulation of FASN expression and inactivation of AKT.;Our results suggest that FASN and activated AKT pathway may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention for the treatment of PTC.",

Four months after delivery of a healthy child without complication she was admitted to the hospital for acute abdominal pain. Laparoscopic left adnexectomy was performed initially in a regional hospital; right cystectomy was done later in a specialized clinic. Intraoperative frozen section and a final pathology revealed that the cyst from the left ovary was composed of mature teratomatous elements, normal thyroid tissue (>50%) and a non-encapsulated focus of follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).Normal and cancerous thyroid tissues were tested for BRAF and RAS mutations by direct sequencing, and for RET/PTC rearrangements by RT-PCR/Southern blotting. A KRAS codon 12 mutation, the GGT → GTT transversion, corresponding to the Gly → Val amino acid change was identified in the absence of other genetic alterations commonly found in PTC.;To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this mutation is described in a papillary thyroid carcinoma arising in struma in the ovarii.

We collected serum samples from 46 PTC patients with (131)I-avid lung metastases (Group A) and 23 PTC patients with non-(131)I-avid lung metastases (Group B) respectively, and both groups were matched for age and sex, without history of other tumors.

The serum protein fingerprints were profiled using surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS, USA) and the difference between the two groups was compared using the Ciphergen Proteinchip 3.1 software. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to construct the decision tree model based on the data of the training set, and the blind test was also conducted for blind test set. Our results showed that a total of 151 valid protein peaks were detected at the molecular range of 1300 Da to 15,000 Da, among which 7 were significantly different between Group A and Group B (P< 0.05). The blind test was conducted via the decision tree model, with a sensitivity of 92.6% (25/27) and a specificity of 85.7% (12/14). In conclusion, the difference in the serum protein fingerprints between Group A and Group B is quite accurate for screenning (131)I uptake in the lung metastases from PTC, conferring important clinical value for the prediction of (131)I uptake and guiding of personalized (131)I treatment decisions.",

Among the genetic aberrations described in PTC, the BRAF V600E mutation and ret/PTC activation occur most commonly. Several studies have investigated the genetic alteration status of multifocal thyroid tumours, with discordant results. To address the question of clonality this study examined disparate geographical and morphological areas from a single PTC (classic PTC, insular and anaplastic foci, and tumour cells adjacent to vascular invasion and lymphocytic infiltrate) for the presence of ret/PTC 1 or BRAF mutations. Moreover, we wanted to investigate the consistency of miRNA signatures within disparate areas of a tumour, and geographical data was further correlated with expression profiles of 330 different miRNAs. Putative miRNA gene targets were predicted for differentially regulated miRNAs and immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue sections in an effort to investigate phenotypic variations in microvascular density (MVD), and cytokeratin and p53 protein expression levels.;All of the morphological areas proved negative for ret/PTC 1 rearrangement. Two distinct foci with classic morphology harboured the BRAF mutation. All other regions, including the insular and anaplastic areas were negative for the mutation. MiRNA profiles were found to distinguish tumours containing the BRAF mutation from the other tumour types, and to differentiate between the more aggressive insular & anaplastic tumours, and the classic variant. Our data corroborated miRNAs previously discovered in this carcinoma, and additional miRNAs linked to various processes involved in tumour growth and proliferation.;The initial genetic alteration analysis indicated that pluriform PTC did not necessarily evolve from classic PTC progenitor foci. Analysis of miRNA profiles however provided an interesting variation on the clonality question. While hierarchical clustering analysis of miRNA expression supported the hypothesis that discrete areas did not evolve from clonal expansion of tumour cells, it did not exclude the possibility of independent mutational events suggesting both phenomena might occur simultaneously within a tumour to enhance cancer progression in geographical micro-environments within a tumour.",

All patients underwent next-generation sequencing using an institutional tissue-based DNA platform (50 genes) and a commercially available cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA) platform (70 genes).;Sequencing data were successfully obtained for both platforms on all patients. The most commonly mutated genes noted on both platforms were TP53 (15/23; 65%) and BRAF (11/23; 48%). Concordance between the tumor and cfDNA data was high for BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, and PTEN and moderate for TP53. Concordance was highest in patients who underwent dual-platform sequencing prior to initiation of definitive treatment, and lowest in patients who underwent cfDNA analysis following treatment. Nineteen patients had treatment at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center following cfDNA sequencing. One patient was observed, and three patients opted for hospice. At the time of last contact, 15/23 (65%) patients were alive.;Next-generation sequencing platforms offer clinicians an opportunity to identify targetable oncogenic events in ATC. To the authors' knowledge, this is the largest sequential cohort of ATC patients who have undergone targeted genomic profiling. Based on these data, utilization of both tumor-based and cfDNA analysis in the context of clinical-trial development and application is recommended. Integration of these or similar platforms in clinical-trial implementation may have the potential to transform clinical outcomes for patients with ATC.",

We also studied mutations involving the ras, Braf, ret or pax8 genes. Results of Q-PCR were closely correlated with those of ICC (P < 0.0001; R = 0.59) and showed that overall tpo expression was lower in all carcinomas than in normal and BT (P < 0.05). The ratio tpo2 or tpo3 to tpo1 was inversed in follicular tumors. Genetic mutations were observed in 90% of PCc, 61.9% of FC, 41.7% of PCfv, 0% of OC and 10% in BT. pax8-ppar gamma1 rearrangement was correlated with qualitative changes in tpo mRNA (P < 0.01). These results confirmed the decrease of TPO expression in 97% of thyroid carcinomas regardless of histological type and the overexpression of shorter splice variants in follicular tumors.

The ubiquitous Raf serine/threonine kinases are pivotal molecules within the Raf/mitogen extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which regulates cellular proliferation and survival. Raf kinase isoforms (wild-type Raf-1 or the b-raf V600E oncogene) are overactivated in a variety of solid tumor types, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and papillary thyroid carcinoma.

Using whole-exome and Sanger sequencing of a multi-generation CS family affected by thyroid and other cancers, we identified a pathogenic missense heterozygous SEC23B variant (c.1781T>G [p.Val594Gly]) that segregates with the phenotype. We also found germline heterozygous SEC23B variants in 3/96 (3%) unrelated mutation-negative CS probands with thyroid cancer and in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), representing apparently sporadic cancers. We note that the TCGA thyroid cancer dataset is enriched with unique germline deleterious SEC23B variants associated with a significantly younger age of onset. SEC23B encodes Sec23 homolog B (S. cerevisiae), a component of coat protein complex II (COPII), which transports proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. Interestingly, germline homozygous or compound-heterozygous SEC23B mutations cause an unrelated disorder, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II, and SEC23B-deficient mice suffer from secretory organ degeneration due to ER-stress-associated apoptosis. By characterizing the p.Val594Gly variant in a normal thyroid cell line, we show that it is a functional alteration that results in ER-stress-mediated cell-colony formation and survival, growth, and invasion, which reflect aspects of a cancer phenotype. Our findings suggest a different role for SEC23B, whereby germline heterozygous variants associate with cancer predisposition potentially mediated by ER stress \"addiction.\"",

        "Doc_abstract":"Activation of the Ras-Raf-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway causes not only proliferation and suppression of apoptosis but also the antioncogenic response of senescence. How these contrasting effects are reconciled to achieve cell transformation and cancer formation is poorly understood. In a system of two-step carcinogenesis (dedifferentiated PC EIA, transformed PC EIA-polyoma-middle T [PC EIA + Py] and PC EIA-v-raf [PC EIA + raf] cells], v-raf cooperated with EIA by virtue of a strong prosurvival effect, not elicited by Py-middle T, evident toward serum-deprivation-and H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis was detected by DNA fragmentation and annexin V staining. The prosurvival function of v-raf was, in part, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)-dependent, as shown by pharmacological MEK inhibition. The MEK-dependent antiapoptotic effect of v-raf was exerted despite a lower level of P-ERK1/2 in EIA + raf cells with respect to EIA + Py/EIA cells, which was dependent on a high tyrosine phosphatase activity, as shown by orthovanadate blockade. An ERK1/2 tyrosine phosphatase was likely involved. The high tyrosine phosphatase activity was instrumental to the complete suppression of senescence, detected by β-galactosidase activity, because tyrosine phosphatase blockade induced senescence in EIA + raf but not in EIA + Py cells. High tyrosine phosphatase activity and evasion from senescence were confirmed in an anaplastic thyroid cancer cell line. Therefore, besides EIA, EIA + raf cells suppress senescence through a new mechanism, namely, phosphatase-mediated P-ERK1/2 inhibition, but, paradoxically, retain the oncogenic effects of the Raf-ERK pathway. We propose that the survival effect of Raf is not a function of absolute P-ERK1/2 levels at a given time but is rather dynamically dependent on greater variations after an apoptotic stimulus.",

The aim of this prospective randomized controlled study was to evaluate the clinical advantages and disadvantages of pCCND.;A total of 181 patients with PTC without evidence of preoperative/intraoperative lymph node metastases (cN0) were randomly assigned to either Group A (n = 88) and treated with total thyroidectomy (TTx) or Group B (n = 93) and treated with TTx + pCCND.;After 5 years of followup, no difference was observed in the outcome of the two groups. However, a higher percentage of Group A were treated with a higher number of (131)I courses (P = .002), whereas a higher prevalence of permanent hypoparathyroidism was observed in Group B (P = .02). No preoperative predictors of central compartment lymph node metastases (N1a) were identified. Only three patients were upstaged, and the therapeutic strategy changed in only one case.;cN0 patients with PTC treated either with TTx or TTx + pCCND showed a similar outcome. One advantage of TTx + pCCND was a reduced necessity to repeat (131)I treatments, but the disadvantage was a higher prevalence of permanent hypoparathyroidism. Almost 50% of patients with PTC had micrometastatic lymph nodes in the central compartment, but none of the presurgical features analyzed, including BRAF mutation, was able to predict their presence; moreover, to be aware of their presence does not seem to have any effect on the outcome.",

We have evaluated CCK-A and CCK-B/gastrin receptors in 34 human thyroid cancers using in vitro receptor autoradiography with 2 different radioligands. We demonstrate high-affinity CCK-B/gastrin receptors in medullary thyroid carcinomas, present at very high incidence (92%) but the absence of these receptors in non-medullary thyroid carcinomas or in normal thyroid glands. CCK-B/gastrin receptors are therefore likely to be the molecular substrate for the pentagastrin-stimulation test, widely used in medullary thyroid carcinomas; moreover, they represent the targets for physiologically secreted gastrin or CCK which, as growth factors, may stimulate the growth of medullary thyroid carcinomas.

Simultaneous occurrence of both disease entities is very rare.;A 59-year-old man with known hypothyroidism from Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) was seen for thyroid nodules. A thyroid ultrasound revealed a heterogeneous thyroid gland with two hypoechoic nodules, one in the right aspect of the isthmus measuring 2.0 cm×3.2 cm×1.7 cm and another one in the left lobe measuring 1.4 cm×1.3 cm×1.2 cm. A fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the right-sided nodule revealed atypical epithelial cells and atypical lymphoid cells in a background of lymphocytic thyroiditis; FNA of the left-sided nodule showed findings of PTC. A total thyroidectomy was performed. Lymph node dissection was not performed. Pathology showed extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type with extreme plasmacytic differentiation in the right nodule and PTC in the left nodule (pT1b Nx Mx). Postoperatively, he underwent radioactive iodine ablation treatment. There was only minimal neck uptake on the post-treatment scan. Further work-up did not show any evidence of extrathyroidal lymphoma. Seven years after the surgery, the patient had no evidence of recurrence of either malignancy.;PTC is the most prevalent thyroid cancer and has an excellent prognosis. Primary thyroid lymphoma is rare and accounts for <5% of all thyroid cancers. Among the primary thyroid lymphomas, MALT lymphoma tends to have a more indolent course and a better prognosis. PTC and MALT lymphoma have been associated with HT. FNA has been validated in several studies for the diagnosis of MALT lymphoma; however, distinguishing MALT lymphoma from HT remains a challenge due to their histological similarities. The treatment of MALT lymphoma remains controversial; however, surgery is generally accepted in the early-stage MALT lymphoma as was performed in the present case.;Since HT is associated with PTC and MALT lymphoma, patients with HT deserve careful surveillance for both disease entities. In our patient, the management of one malignancy did not affect the management of the other, and the prognosis did not seem to be affected.",

We investigated clinical outcomes of remnant thyroid ablation with a low radioiodine activity in Korean patients with low to intermediate-risk thyroid cancer. For remnant thyroid ablation, 176 patients received radioiodine of 1.1 GBq, under a standard thyroid hormone withdrawal and a low iodine diet protocol. Serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone stimulated thyroglobulin (off-Tg) and thyroglobulin-antibody (Tg-Ab), and a post-therapy whole body scan (RxWBS) were evaluated. Completion of remnant ablation was considered when there was no visible uptake on RxWBS and undetectable off-Tg (<1.0 ng/mL). Various factors including age, off-Tg, and histopathology were analyzed to predict ablation success rates. Of 176 patients, 68.8% (n = 121) who achieved successful remnant ablation were classified into Group A, and the remaining 55 were classified into Group B. Group A presented with significantly lower off-Tg at the first radioiodine administration (pre-ablative Tg) than those of Group B (1.2 ± 2.3 ng/mL vs. 6.2 ± 15.2 ng/mL, P = 0.027). Pre-ablative Tg was the only significant factor related with ablation success rates. Diagnostic performances of pre-ablative Tg < 10.0 ng/mL were sensitivity of 99.1%, specificity of 14.0%, positive predictive value of 71.1%, and negative predictive value of 87.5%, respectively. Single administration of low radioiodine activity could be sufficient for remnant thyroid ablation in patients with low to intermediate-risk thyroid cancer. Pre-ablative Tg with cutoff value of 10.0 ng/mL is a promising factor to predict successful remnant ablation. ",

Recently, the International Atomic Energy Agency issued document K9010241, which recommends that patient discharge from the hospital must be based on the particular status of each patient. This work measures effective dose received by caregivers of patients treated with I at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología, Mexico City. Thermoluminescent dosimeters were carried during a 15-d period by 40 family caregivers after patient release from hospital. Relatives were classified into two groups, ambulatory and hospitalized, according to the release mode of the patient, and three categories according to the individual patient home and transport facilities. Categories A, B, and C were defined going from most to least adequate concerning public exposure risk. Measurements were performed for 20 family caregivers in each group. The effective dose received by all caregivers participating in this study was found to be less than 5 mSv, the recommended limit per event for caregivers suggested by ICRP 103. In addition, 70 and 90% of ambulatory and hospitalized groups, respectively, received doses lower than 1 mSv. Caregivers belonging to category C, with home situations that are not appropriate for immediate release, received the highest average doses; i.e., 2.2 ± 1.3 and 3.1 ± 1.0 mSv for hospitalized and ambulatory patients, respectively. Results of this work have shown that the proper implementation of radiation protection instructions for relatives and patients can reduce significantly the risk that differentiated thyroid cancer patients treated with I can represent for surrounding individuals. The results also stress the relevance of the patient's particular lifestyle and transport conditions as the prevailing factors related to the dose received by the caregiver. Therefore, the patient's status should be the criterion used to decide his/her release modality. This work provides support to recommend the implementation of the \"patient specific release criteria\" in accordance with ICRP 94, IAEA Safety Report No. 63, and IAE document K9010241 A for patients treated with radiopharmaceuticals.

We retrospectively retrieved 10 cases of hobnail variant from 2,904 consecutive PTC patients. Cytologic and histopathologic slides from those 10 patients were reviewed. We performed molecular analysis for BRAF, ALK, and TERT promoter mutations on paraffin blocks from surgical specimens, and further analyzed the clinicopathologic characteristics of all case reports published in the literature until now. Cytologically, all tumors were characterized by single cells with eccentric nuclei and tapering cytoplasm (comet-like cells), and syncytial or micropapillary clusters with apically placed nuclei resulting in a hobnail appearance in both conventional smears and liquid-based cytology. The BRAF V600E mutation was found in 8 cases (80%) whereas no cases had ALK fusion or TERT promoter mutations. In the literature review of 55 patients including our cases, most patients presented with advanced stage cancer, and disease-specific survival rates were 83%, 71%, and 54% at 5, 10, and 20 years after the initial surgery, respectively. Characteristic cytologic features can allow a preoperative diagnosis of the hobnail variant of PTC based on cytology specimens. Further studies should be performed to identify the molecular genetics of the variant. ",

However, their pathogenic role and clinical significance are still debated. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of RET/PTC rearrangement in a cohort of BRAF WT PTCs by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and to search a reliable cut-off level in order to distinguish clonal or non-clonal RET changes.;Forty BRAF WT PTCs were analyzed by FISH for RET rearrangements. As controls, six BRAFV600E mutated PTCs, 13 follicular adenomas (FA), and ten normal thyroid parenchyma were also analyzed.;We performed FISH analysis on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using a commercially available RET break-apart probe. A cut-off level equivalent to 10.2% of aberrant cells was accepted as significant. To validate FISH results, we analyzed the study cohort by qRT-PCR.;Split RET signals above the cut-off level were observed in 25% (10/40) of PTCs, harboring a percentage of positive cells ranging from 12 to 50%, and in one spontaneous FA (1/13, 7.7%). Overall, the data obtained by FISH matched well with qRT-PCR results. Challenging findings were observed in five cases showing a frequency of rearrangement very close to the cut-off.;FISH approach represents a powerful tool to estimate the ratio between broken and non-broken RET tumor cells. Establishing a precise FISH cut-off may be useful in the interpretation of the presence of RET rearrangement, primarily when this strategy is used for cytological evaluation or for targeted therapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is frequently multifocal, which can represent either intraglandular spread from a single primary tumor or multiple synchronous primary tumors (MSPTs). To distinguish and characterize these entities, we investigated whether multifocal PTCs contain genetically similar or different mutations and have particular histopathologic characteristics. In 60 cases of PTC with 2 to 4 discrete tumor foci, each focus was tested for BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS point mutations and RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3 rearrangements and analyzed for various histopathologic features. Overall, BRAF mutations were found in 43% of tumors, RAS in 27%, and RET/PTC in 2%. Four different patterns of mutation occurrence were identified: (i) 2 foci containing different mutations (30%); (ii) 1 tumor containing a mutation and another carrying no mutations (32%); (iii) both/all tumors containing the same mutation (25%); (iv) all tumors having no mutations (13%). The 30% of cases with 2 different mutations represent a group of tumors that are unequivocally MSPT. These tumors more commonly occurred in different lobes, although they could be located as close as 0.6 cm from each other. Moreover, MSPTs typically demonstrated distinct histologic variants/microscopic features, were encapsulated or had a smooth border, and showed no microscopic peritumoral dissemination. In conclusion, we demonstrate that at least 30% of multifocal PTCs represent unequivocal MSPTs that develop through distinct molecular alterations and that as many as 60% of multifocal PTCs are likely MSPTs. Histopathologically, MSPTs are typically located in different lobes, have distinct growth patterns, and do not show microscopic peritumoral dissemination. ",

PAX8/PPARG and RET/PTC rearrangements were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while BRAF and RAS mutations were detected by pyrosequencing.;BRAF mutations were associated with a carcinoma in 100% of samples; RAS mutations were associated with a carcinoma in 57% of samples. Forty-nine percent of the carcinomas were identified by molecular testing in the group of follicular lesions, which increased the sensitivity from 60% to 80% compared to cytologic FNA evaluation alone. While follicular lesion FNAs had a 28% risk of malignancy, the risk increased to 71% for mutation-positive follicular lesions, and decreased to 18% for mutation-negative follicular lesions.;Molecular testing of air-dried FNA samples improves presurgical diagnosis. Discrepant sensitivities and specificities reported previously are most likely related to the use of different grading schemes resulting in different compositions of the cytologic categories, interobserver variability to diagnose follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinomas and a different prevalence of RAS mutations in follicular carcinomas.

The study population comprised 54 patients (24 men, 30 women; age range 22-90 years) with histologically confirmed DTC who presented with recurrent or persistent disease as indicated by elevated Tg levels after initial treatment. All patients were negative on the iodine-131 post-therapy whole-body scans. Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) was performed in a subgroup of 36 patients. The study population consisted of two groups: Group A ( n=22) comprised patients with disease recurrence as shown by elevated Tg levels but without detectable pathology. In group B ( n=32), pre-existing lesions were known. Among the 54 cases, SSTR scintigraphy was true positive in 33 (61.1%), true negative in 4 (7.4%) and false negative in 17 (31.5%) cases, which resulted in a sensitivity of 66%. A total of 138 tumour foci were localised in 33 patients. The fraction of true positive (99m)Tc-TOC findings was positively correlated ( P<0.01) with elevated Tg levels (higher than 30 ng/ml). Despite two false positive findings, analysis on a lesion basis demonstrated better diagnostic efficacy with (18)F-FDG PET ( P<0.001); however, it also revealed substantial agreement between the imaging techniques [Cohen's kappa of 0.62 (0.47-0.78)].

In fetal cell carcinogenesis, thyroid tumor cells are assumed to be derived from three types of fetal thyroid cell which only exist in fetuses or young children, namely, thyroid stem cells (TSCs), thyroblasts and prothyrocytes, by proliferation without differentiation. Genomic alternations, such as RET/PTC and PAX8-PPARγ1 rearrangements and a mutation in the BRAF gene, play an oncogenic role by preventing thyroid fetal cells from differentiating. Fetal cell carcinogenesis effectively explains recent molecular and clinical evidence regarding thyroid cancer, including thyroid cancer initiating cells (TCICs), and it underscores the importance of identifying a stem cells and clarifying the molecular mechanism of organ development in cancer research. It introduces three important concepts, the reverse approach, stem cell crisis and mature and immature cancers. Further, it implies that analysis of a small population of cells in a cancer tissue will be a key technique in establishing future laboratory tests. In the contrary, mass analysis such as gene expression profiling, whole genomic scan, and proteomics analysis may have definite limitations since they can only provide information based on many cells.

Currently therapy is restricted to surgical removal of all neoplastic tissue lacking alternative forms of treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Therefore MTC is a particularly attractive target for gene therapeutic approaches. Many promising gene therapy strategies have been used in various animal models of MTC, showing enhanced antitumoral efficacy, and these will hopefully extend our current standard of care in the future. These approaches can tentatively be subdivided into four groups: (a) Inhibition of oncogenic RET signaling, (b) suicide gene therapy, (c) immunotherapy, and (d) combination of immunotherapy and suicide approaches. To block oncogenic signal transduction dominant-negative RET mutants were delivered into tumor cells and found to possess strong antineoplastic activity, including tumor growth suppression and increased animal survival. Suicide gene therapeutic approaches applied to MTC treatment featured either gene transfer of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase with concomitant application of ganciclovir or delivery of nitric oxide synthase II. Here antitumor effects were attributed to the occurrence of substantial bystander activities. Immunotherapy approaches comprised stimulation of immune response by delivery of interleukin 2 or 12. Finally, treatment with herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir in combination with interleukin 2 was found to be superior over either treatment alone. This review discusses the various gene therapeutic approaches applied to MTC treatment in detail, gives an overview on the diverse vector systems used to achieve efficient transduction of thyroid cancer cells, and points out the strategies employed to accomplish target cell selective gene expression thereby contributing to enhanced safety of gene therapy for MTC",

B) patients (n 11) previously thyroidectomized and high calcitonin levels with or without radiological evidence of local regional or distant metastases.

An extensive lymphadenectomy performed early in the treatment and re-operative cervical lymphadenectomy in patients with persistently high calcitonin levels after thyroidectomy significantly improved the outcome, although re-operation rarely results in normalized calcitonin levels and is associated with a higher incidence of complications.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The high sensitivity of pentagastrin stimulation in detecting primary or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) suggests widespread expression of the corresponding receptor type on human MTC. Indeed, autoradiographic studies have demonstrated cholecystokinin (CCK)-B/gastrin receptors not only in more than 90% of MTCs but also in a high percentage of small cell lung cancers, some ovarian cancers, astrocytomas and potentially a variety of adenocarcinomas. The aim of this study was to systematically screen and optimize, in a preclinical model and a pilot clinical study, suitable radioligands for targeting CCK-B receptors in vivo.;A variety of CCK/gastrin-related peptides, all bearing the C-terminal CCK receptor-binding tetrapeptide sequence Trp-Met-Asp-PheNH2 or derivatives thereof, were studied. They were radioiodinated by the lodogen or Bolton-Hunter procedures. The peptides were members of the gastrin or CCK families, which differ by the intramolecular position of a tyrosyl moiety. Their stability and affinity were studied in vitro and in vivo; their biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy were tested in nude mice bearing subcutaneous human MTC xenografts. Diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) derivatives of suitable peptides were synthesized successfully, and their preclinical and initial clinical evaluations were performed, labeled with 111In.;All members of the CCK or gastrin families were stable in serum (with half-lives of several hours at 37 degrees C); nevertheless, the stability of those peptides bearing N-terminal pGlu residues or D-amino acids was significantly higher. In accordance with their comparably low affinity, nonsulfated members of the CCK family showed fairly low uptake in the tumor and other CCK-B receptor-expressing tissues. Sulfated CCK derivatives performed significantly better but also displayed a comparably high uptake in normal CCK-A receptor-expressing tissues. This effect was probably due to their similar affinity for both CCK-A and CCK-B receptors. Best tumor uptake and tumor-to-nontumor ratios were obtained with members of the gastrin family because of their selectivity and affinity for the CCK-B receptor subtype. Pilot therapy experiments in MTC-bearing animals showed significant antitumor efficacy compared with untreated controls. DTPA derivatives of minigastrin were successfully developed. In a pilot clinical study, radioiodinated and 111In-labeled derivatives showed excellent targeting of physiological CCK-B receptor-expressing organs, as well as all known tumor sites.;CCK/gastrin analogs may be a useful new class of receptor-binding peptides for diagnosis and therapy of CCK-B receptor-expressing tumors, such as MTC or small cell lung cancer. Nonsulfated gastrin derivatives may be preferable because of their CCK-B receptor selectivity, hence lower accretion in normal CCK-A receptor-expressing organs.",

DNA was obtained from cell blocks or from stained smears and subjected to NGS to analyse mutations in 50 genes. Mutations in BRAF, NRAS, KRAS and PTEN, that are known to be involved in thyroid cancer biology, were detected in seven FNA samples. The presence of a mutation in these genes was a strong indicator of cancer because five (71%) of the mutation-positive FNA samples had a malignant diagnosis after surgery. Moreover, there was only an 8% cancer risk in nodules with an indeterminate cytological diagnosis but with a negative molecular test.;This study demonstrates that thyroid FNA can be analysed successfully by NGS.

The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy and safety of different radioiodine activities. In addition, we compared the ablation rate in patients treated in the hypothyroid state or after recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) administration, retrospectively reviewing the records of 471 patients affected by differentiated thyroid cancer.;Patients were subdivided into three groups on the basis of the different activities of radioiodine administered and taking into account the different approaches used to perform the therapy: thyroid hormonal withdrawal or rhTSH stimulation.;The success of TRA was evaluated 12 months later.

Thyroglobulin mutations which caused overt Cretins with physical and mental development impairment were once believed rare. However, since the discovery of mild hypothyroidism due to thyroglobulin mutations, 54 cases from 43 families were identified in Japan. The patients presented either transient elevation of serum TSH during infancy or growing giant goiters from childhood. Among 15 patients who were born after initiation of neonatal screening in 1979, 13 patients were identified by high serum TSH. In contrast, the major manifestation in patients born before 1979 is persistent growth of goiters with euthyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism. Among 25 mutations, Cys1264Arg and Cys1077Arg are hot spots. The Cys1264Arg patients were found all over Japan, but the Cys1077Arg patients were confined to a small village of a southern island in Japan. The occurrence of the thyroglobulin mutations in the general population is 1/67,000. The pathogenesis of abnormal thyroglobulin is defective intracellular transport. The histological findings include empty colloid in the follicles and distended ER filling the entire cytoplasm of the thyrocytes. An in vitro expression study showed that abnormal thyroglobulin was not secreted from cultured cells. Because of persistent growth of the thyroid, 25 patients underwent surgical treatment. Among them, 11 patients suffered from thyroid cancers, most of which were of the papillary type. We found two BRAF activating mutations Val599Glu and Cys600Gln in five patients tested. In conclusion, we found many patients with thyroglobulin mutations in Japan. They were found by high serum TSH at neonatal screening or persistent growth of goiters in adults. Surgical treatments were inevitable, and 40% of the removed thyroids contained thyroid cancers, some of which were caused by activating mutations of the BRAF gene.",

We retrospectively reviewed 48 patients with tracheal invasion by papillary thyroid carcinoma, follicular thyroid carcinoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma by means of clinical data ranging from 1993 to 2011. The patients were classified into three groups in terms of the depth and extent of tracheal invasion by the tumors, i.e., group A of 18 patients with localized tracheal invasion; group B of 21 patients with intraluminal tracheal invasion, and group C of nine patients with extensive invasion of the trachea, larynx, esophagus and/or mediastinum.

A survival analysis was done using Kaplan-Meier Estimator for cumulative survival probability together with Log-Rank test, and Cox Regression Model was used for multivariate analysis.

To further define this, we examined 21 PTCs from patients 21 yr of age or younger (52% were 18-21 yr of age) for the presence of CD4+ (helper), CD8+ (killer), CD19+ (B cells), and CD56+ (natural killer) cells as well as proliferating lymphocytes (Ki-67+). Nearly half the PTCs contained CD4+ (9 of 21, 43%), CD8+ (8 of 21, 38%), or CD19+ (10 of 21, 48%) lymphocytes. Only one PTC (1 of 21, 5%) contained CD56+ lymphocytes, and none contained all four cell types. By dual staining, none of these lymphocytes were proliferating (Ki-67+). However, PTCs containing either CD8+ cells (n = 8) or a combination of CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ cells (n = 5) contained more numerous proliferating lymphocytes than did PTCs containing any other combination (14.2-fold increase, P = 0.03 and 13.1-fold increase, P = 0.003, respectively). During follow-up, none of the PTCs containing either CD8+ lymphocytes or the combination of CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ lymphocytes recurred.

Patients were also classified into two groups based on whether sTg2, 1-2 years after sTg1, had decreased by ≥50% (Group 1) or had either decreased by <50% or increased (Group 2). sTg was measured every 1-2 years until structural recurrence or BR.;Patients remaining in NSED showed a decrease in serial sTg. Of patients in Groups A, B, and C, 41%, 17%, and 1%, respectively, achieved BR, and there was a significant difference in the BR rate between Groups 1 and 2 (p<0.001). In patients with structural recurrence, serial sTg generally did not decrease from sTg1. There was a significant difference in the recurrence rate among Groups A, B, and C (p=0.005) and between Groups 1 and 2 (p<0.001).;We found that 41% of patients with sTg1 in the range 2-5 ng/mL achieved BR, and that sTg1 and percent change of subsequent sTg were predictive of BR. Repeated sTg measurements are useful for predicting patient prognosis in patients with DTC.",

Due to the history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and a rapid increase in size of the thyroid gland, diagnoses of thyroid lymphoma and anaplastic thyroid cancer were considered. Thyroidectomy was attempted at an outside facility to relieve compressive symptoms.

The major inclusion criterion was the presence of a radioiodine-positive LNR after previous total thyroidectomy and at least two ineffective (131)I treatments. The protocol was designed as follows: Day 0--all patients were hospitalized and received 3.7 GBq of (131) I while clinically hypothyroid. Day 3--pre-surgery whole-body scan with a therapeutic (131)I dose (TxWBS) was acquired. Day 5--neck surgery using a gamma probe (Navigator GPS, AutoSuture, Italy), recording the absolute counts and the lesion/background (L/B) counts ratio was performed. Day 7--post-surgery TxWBS was performed using the remaining radioactivity.;This protocol permitted us to identify neoplastic foci with high sensitivity and specificity, enabling us to remove lymph node metastases resistant to radioiodine therapy in a single session. The protocol also allowed detection of some additional tumoural foci in sclerotic areas or behind vascular structures that were not seen at the pre-surgery TxWBS evaluation.",

Indeed, about 40% of PTCs harbor mutations in BRAF gene, whereas RET rearrangements (RET/PTC oncogenes) are present in about 20% of cases. Finally, RAS mutations and TRK rearrangements account for about 5% each of these malignancies. We used RNA-Sequencing to identify fusion transcripts and mutations in cancer driver genes in a cohort of 18 PTC patients. Furthermore, we used targeted DNA sequencing to validate identified mutations. We extended the screening to 50 PTC patients and 30 healthy individuals. Using this approach we identified new missense mutations in CBL, NOTCH1, PIK3R4 and SMARCA4 genes. We found somatic mutations in DICER1, MET and VHL genes, previously found mutated in other tumors, but not described in PTC. We identified a new chimeric transcript generated by the fusion of WNK1 and B4GALNT3 genes, correlated with B4GALNT3 overexpression. Our data confirmed PTC genetic heterogeneity, revealing that gene expression correlates more with the mutation pattern than with tumor staging. Overall, this study provides new data about mutational landscape of this neoplasia, suggesting potential pharmacological adjuvant therapies against Notch signaling and chromatin remodeling enzymes.

The phosphoinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase B/AKT (PI3K-PKB/AKT) pathway is one of the most critical molecular signaling pathways implicated in key cellular processes. Its continuous activation by several aberrant receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and genetic mutations in its downstream effectors result in high cell proliferation in a broad number of cancers, including thyroid carcinomas. In this review article, the role of different signaling pathways of PI3K/AKT in thyroid cancers, with the emphasis on the PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), PI3K/AKT/forkhead box O (FOXO) and PI3K/AKT/phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) pathways, and various therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways have been summarized. In most of the in vitro studies, agents inhibiting mTOR in monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy for thyroid malignancies have been introduced as promising anticancer therapies. FOXOs and PTEN are two outstanding downstream targets of the PI3K/AKT pathway. At the present time, no study has been undertaken to consider thyroid cancer treatment via FOXOs and PTEN targeting. According to the critical role of these proteins in cell cycle arrest, it seems that a treatment strategy based on the combination of FOXOs or PTEN activity induction with PI3K/AKT downstream mediators (e.g., mTOR) inhibition will be beneficial and promising in thyroid cancer treatment.

The levels were designated as such in situ prior to surgical pathology specimen processing. Reports of the preoperative FNA cytopathologic findings, the extent of lateral neck dissection by levels, and the postoperative final histopathologic examination were reviewed.;A total of 53 patients underwent therapeutic lateral neck dissection for FNA-confirmed nodal metastasis of PTC at a minimum of one lateral neck level.

It is believed that the existence of the V600E mutation may demonstrate an association with the clinicopathological characteristics of patients, however, inconsistencies remain in the literature. A number of explanatory theories have been presented in order to resolve these discrepancies. Recently, it has been suggested that the V600E mutation may function as a target in a novel approach that may aid the diagnosis and prognosis of thyroid carcinoma, with a number of vying methods put forward to that effect.

Since discordant data on the clinico-pathologic features of B-RAF mutated PTC are present in the literature, the aim of the present co-operative study was to establish the prevalence of this genetic alteration and to perform a genotype-phenotype correlation in a large cohort of patients with PTC. To this purpose, a series of 260 sporadic PTCs with different histological variants were included in the study. The mutational analysis of the B-RAF gene was performed either by RT-PCR followed by single-stranded conformational polymorphism or by PCR and direct sequencing. Statistical analyses were obtained by means of chi2/Fisher's exact test and t-test. Overall, a heterozygous T > A transversion at nucleotide 1799 (V600E) was found in 99 out of 260 PTCs (38%). According to the histological type of the tumor, the B-RAF (V600E) mutation was present in 48.3% of cases of classic PTCs (85 out of 176), in 17.6% (nine out of 51) of follicular variants of PTCs, in 21.7% (five out of 23) in other PTC variants and in none of the ten poorly differentiated tumors. B-RAF (V600E) was significantly associated with the classic variant of PTC (P = 0.0001) and with an older age at diagnosis (P = 0.01). No statistically significant correlation was found among the presence of B-RAF (V600E) and gender, tumor node metastasis (TNM), multicentricity of the tumor, stage at diagnosis and outcome. In conclusion, the present study reports the prevalence of B-RAF (V600E) (38%) in the largest series of sporadic PTCs, including 260 cases from three different Italian referring centers. This prevalence is similar to that calculated by pooling together all data previously reported, 39.6% (759 out of 1914 cases), thus indicating that the prevalence of this genetic event lies around 38-40%. Furthermore, B-RAF (V600E) was confirmed to be associated with the papillary growth pattern, but not with poorer differentiated PTC variants. A significant association of B-RAF mutation was also found with an older age at diagnosis, the mutation being very rare in childhood and adolescent PTCs. Finally, no correlation was found with a poorer prognosis and a worse outcome after a median follow-up of 72 months.",

An unexpected expression of galectin-3 was demonstrated in a subset of HT together with the presence of HBME-1, c-met and cyclin-D1 that are also involved in malignant transformation and deregulated cell growth. Furthermore, a loss of allelic heterozygosity in a specific cancer-related chromosomal region was demonstrated in some HT harbouring galectin-3-positive follicular cells, by using laser capture microdissection. On the basis of the morphological and molecular findings we identified four subsets of HT: (a) HT with classic features of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis; (b) HT associated to hyperplastic/adenomatous lesions; (c) HT harbouring thyroid cancer precursors; (d) HT associated to unequivocal thyroid microcarcinomas.

Fifty percent inhibitory concentrations were in the low nanomolar range.;In vitro, [111In-DOTA0]CCK8 showed specific internalization in CCK-B receptor-positive rat pancreatic tumor cells AR42J. Internalization of the analog appeared to be time and temperature dependent and receptor specific. From the data obtained with [111In-DOTA0]CCK8 and (125I)I-gastrin, the latter being a specific ligand for the CCK-B receptor, the rat pancreatic cell line CA20948 also appeared to be CCK-B receptor positive. This provides an in vitro and in vivo rat tumor model because this cell line can be grown to solid tumors in Lewis rats. In vivo biodistribution experiments in CA20948 tumor-bearing Lewis rats showed rapid clearance of [111In-DOTA0]CCK8, and specific uptake was found in the CCK-B receptor-expressing stomach and tumor. Furthermore, comparing [111In-DOTA0]CCK8 with the radioiodinated nonsulfated CCK10 analog (D-Tyr-Gly-Asp-Tyr-Nle-Gly-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2), both ligands having high affinity for the CCK-B receptor, tumor-to-blood ratios were significantly higher for [111In-DOTA0]CCK8 than for 125I-CCK10, analogous to the findings with radioiodinated and 111In-labeled octreotide. The study in humans with [111In-DTPA0]CCK8 showed receptor-specific uptake in the CCK-B receptor-positive stomach and in metastases in the neck region up to 48 h after injection.;[111In-DOTA0]CCK8 is most promising for scintigraphy and, after coupling to therapeutic radionuclides, for radionuclide therapy of human CCK-B receptor-positive tumors such as MTC and small cell lung cancer.",

Four DD fragments that were overexpressed in tumor tissue were identified as parts of genes from the mitochondrial genome: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase 5, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase 6, cytochrome b, and cytochrome c oxidase I. The expression profiles of these genes were confirmed by hybridization using a DNA dot-blot array and radioactively labeled complex cDNA probes generated from tumor (30 biopsies) and nontumor (15 biopsies) total RNA. Cytochrome c oxidase III was also found to be overexpressed in papillary carcinomas, while the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial transcription factor A showed similar mRNA expression levels in tumor and nontumor tissue. Electron microscopy showed increased number and size of mitochondria in papillary carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody recognizing a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein showed positivity in all cases of papillary carcinoma (44 samples), while normal thyroid tissue (34 samples) was negative in all cases except 3, in which there was a weak, focal cytoplasmic staining. We conclude that papillary thyroid carcinomas show increased expression of mitochondrial mRNA and proteins, encoded by nuclear as well as mitochondrial genes.",

Research data on 45 patients (39 women, 6 men, age 22-75 years) with DTC and without high level of Tg autoantibodies have been included in the study.

The postoperative level of Tg as TTM coefficient (ratio of postoperative Tg to daily L-thyroxin dose in mcg to body weight in kg) was higher in patients with unfavorable prognosis: (a) capsular invasion, (b) cervical lymph nodes metastases, (c) advanced disease stage, (d) high risk of recurrence. The postoperative serum Tg levels were similar in primary disease patients and patients with DTC recurrence. There was no relation between preoperative Tg level and any prognostic factors although there was a tendency to higher (more than 2 ng/ml) Tg levels in patents with high preoperative Tg levels.

The therapeutic options for this type of thyroid cancer are limited and generally not efficient. Recent studies with retinoic acid (RA) have shown that this drug can induce re-differentiation of the thyrocyte and tumor regression after 131I therapy. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of RA therapy in patients with extensive thyroid tumor involvement, which lost radioiodine uptake ability. A total of 5 patients (1 follicular carcinoma, 3 papillary carcinomas and 1 poorly differentiated carcinoma) were treated with isotretinoin (1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks and then submitted to radioiodine therapy. Three parameters for assessment of RA effects were established: a) reduction of serum thyroglobulin levels; b) increment of the post-therapeutic dose radioiodine uptake; c) tumor size regression after therapy. All patients completed the treatment and the most frequent side effects were dry skin and lips and hypertriglyceridemia. One patient showed satisfactory response (2 or more of the 3 criteria were reached) and a new cycle of RA was given. In two, just a partial response (1 criterion) was seen and the other patients did not respond. Based on these results, isotretinoin might be an option for de-differentiated thyroid cancer, with low rate of severe side effects, especially when compared with cytotoxic drugs.

        "Doc_abstract":"The high sensitivity of pentagastrin stimulation in detecting primary or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) suggests widespread expression of the corresponding receptor type on human MTC. Indeed, autoradiographic studies demonstrated cholecystokinin (CCK)-B/gastrin receptors not only in >90% of MTCs but in a high percentage of small cell lung cancers and potentially a variety of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. In a pilot study, we have demonstrated the feasibility of radiolabeled gastrin-I to target CCK-B receptor-expressing tissues in vivo in animals and patients (T. M. Behr et al., Eur. J. Nucl. Med., 25: 424-430, 1998). The aim of the present study was to systematically optimize, in a preclinical model, suitable radioligands for targeting CCK-B receptors in vivo. For this purpose, a variety of CCK/gastrin-related peptides, all having in common the COOH-terminal CCK-receptor binding tetrapeptide sequence Trp-Met-Asp-PheNH2 or derivatives thereof, were studied. They were radioiodinated by the Iodogen or Bolton-Hunter procedures. The peptides tested were members of the gastrin- or cholecystokinin families or possessed characteristics of both, which differ by the intramolecular position of a tyrosyl moiety (occurring in native or sulfated form). Their stability and affinity were studied in vitro and in vivo; their biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy were tested in nude mice bearing s.c. human MTC xenografts. Diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate derivatives of suitable peptides were synthesized, evaluated, and labeled with (111)In. All members of the CCK or gastrin family were stable in serum (with t(1/2)s of several hours at 37 degrees C); nevertheless, the stability of those peptides was highest that bore the NH2-terminal pGlu residues (e.g., big gastrin, gastrin-I, caerulein, and others) or D-amino acids. In accordance to their comparably low affinity, nonsulfated members of the CCK family showed fairly low uptake in the tumor and other CCK-B receptor-expressing tissues (e.g., the stomach). Sulfated CCK derivatives performed significantly better but additionally displayed a high uptake in normal, CCK-A receptor-expressing tissues (such as the liver/gallbladder, pancreas, and bowel). Best tumor uptake and tumor:nontumor ratios were obtained with members of the gastrin family, probably because of their selectivity and affinity for the CCK-B receptor subtype. Pilot therapy experiments in MTC bearing animals showed significant antitumor efficacy as compared with untreated controls. (111)In-Labeled diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate derivatives of minigastrin showed excellent targeting of CCK-B receptor-expressing tissues in animals and a normal human volunteer. These data suggest that CCK/gastrin analogues may be a useful new class of receptor binding peptides for diagnosis and therapy of CCK-B receptor-expressing tumors, such as MTC or small cell lung cancer. Nonsulfated gastrin derivatives may be preferable because of their CCK-B receptor selectivity, and hence, lower accretion in normal CCK-A receptor-expressing organs. Further preclinical as well as clinical studies are ongoing.",

Little is known about the methylation status of MLH1 and MGMT in thyroid tumours and its association with MSI and mutational status.;In a series of 96 thyroid tumours whose mutational profiles of BRAF, IDH1 and NRAS mutations and RET/PTC were previously determined, we investigated MLH1 and MGMT expression and methylation status by qPCR and methylation-specific PCR after bisulphite treatment, respectively. MSI was determined by PCR using seven standard microsatellite markers.;Samples with point mutations (BRAF, IDH1 and NRAS) show a decrease in MLH1 expression when compared to negative samples. Additionally, malignant lesions show a higher MSI pattern than benign lesions. The MSI phenotype was also associated with down-regulation of MLH1.;The results of this study allow us to conclude that low expression of MLH1 is associated with BRAF V600E mutations, RET/PTC rearrangements and transitions (IDH1 and NRAS) in patients with thyroid carcinoma.

Western blot analysis was used to confirm the Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway activation and to measure levels of essential cell-cell contact molecules. Assays for cell adhesion and migration were performed to investigate the cell motility.;E(2) treatment of TT-raf cells resulted in the Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway activation as evidenced by increased levels of phospho-MEK1/2 and -ERK1/2. This resulted in significant reductions in levels of essential cell-cell contact molecules including E-cadherin, beta-catenin, and occludin. Importantly, activation of the Raf-1/ MEK/ERK pathway and the associated decrease in essential cell-cell contact molecules dramatically inhibited the abilities of adhesion and migration in MTC cells. Furthermore, treatment of Raf-1-activated cells with U0126, a specific inhibitor of MEK, abrogated these Raf-1-induced effects indicating that the suppression of the metastatic phenotype in MTC cells is a MEK-dependent pathway.;These data suggest that the Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway regulates essential cell-cell contact molecules and metastatic phenotype of MTC cells.

However, cathepsin B has also been localized to the extrafollicular space and is therefore suggested to promote invasiveness and metastasis in thyroid carcinomas through, e.g., ECM degradation. In this study, immunofluorescence and biochemical data from subcellular fractionation revealed that cathepsin B, in its single- and two-chain forms, is localized to endo-lysosomes in the papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line KTC-1 and in the anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell lines HTh7 and HTh74. This distribution is not affected by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) incubation of HTh74, the only cell line that expresses a functional TSH-receptor. Immunofluorescence data disclosed an additional nuclear localization of cathepsin B immunoreactivity. This was supported by biochemical data showing a proteolytically active variant slightly smaller than the cathepsin B proform in nuclear fractions. We also demonstrate that immunoreactions specific for cathepsin V, but not cathepsin L, are localized to the nucleus in HTh74 in peri-nucleolar patterns.

Currently, knowledge about genetic causes of thyroid tumors has begun applying into target gene therapy providing new therapeutic drugs and more individualized treatment. This review summarizes main genetic causes of thyroid tumors and their application in target gene therapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Normal and neoplastic thyroid tissues express a variety of oncogenes, growth factors, and growth factor receptors. The increased expression of a mutated form or forms of c-myc and c-ras appears to be associated with some epithelial and medullary thyroid carcinomas. In some cases the presence of these oncogenes correlates with less favorable histologic appearance. The possibility of cooperation between oncogene products (myc and ras) in neoplastic development is raised by studies on transformed thyroid cells in culture. Moreover, a tissue-specific oncogene associated with papillary carcinoma recently has been described. The role of excessive growth factor or growth factor receptor expression in thyroid carcinoma also has been discussed and may, as with other tumor types, be linked to specific oncogene products (e.g., c-erb-B encoding for the EGF receptor). However, the regulation of oncogenes in various stages of differentiation of thyroid tissues is not well understood. In addition to describing these associations with thyroid carcinoma and putative unchecked growth factor action in the development of neoplasia, more direct demonstrations of a causal relationship are necessary. Thus, one needs to overexpress oncogenes/growth factors in normal cell lines (as has been described in this review) and observe whether cellular transformation or dedifferentiation or both occur. The ability to specifically block oncogene or growth factor expression in neoplastic cell lines at the RNA or protein level (with antisense oligonucleotides or monoclonal antibodies, respectively) should provide important information about the pathogenetic importance of these factors. It may be anticipated that reversing the overexpression of certain oncogenes can lead to normal cellular proliferation, morphology, and differentiation. The knowledge obtained from investigating the associations of oncogenes and growth factors with thyroid cancer should provide insight into the mechanisms involved in cell growth and differentiation and in the biochemical steps involved in neoplastic transformation. New insights into these processes may lead to specific therapeutic measures designed to block aberrant expression of the cellular products involved in neoplasia. A more complete understanding of the role of oncogenes in thyroid cancer also may lead to the development of specific tumor markers that may be useful in the early diagnosis of thyroid cancer and the follow-up of therapeutic maneuvers. If specific markers can be identified, analysis of fine-needle aspiration specimens of the thyroid or imaging techniques (using for example, oncogene-specific monoclonal antibodies) could be added to the diagnostic armamentarium for thyroid disease.",

Nine months after initial diagnosis, radiographic studies revealed multiple pulmonary metastases. A dermatologic examination showed a solitary 1.2-cm chest nodule. Skin biopsy from this nodule revealed infiltrative dermal spindle cells arranged in poorly formed fascicles. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the tumor cells to be PAX-8 (+), pancytokeratin (+, focally), TTF-1 (-) and SOX-10 (-). Comparison with the patient's primary anaplastic thyroid carcinoma revealed focal areas of poorly differentiated spindle cells morphologically similar to the malignant spindle cells in the skin biopsy. Together, these findings confirmed the diagnosis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma metastatic to skin. Cutaneous metastasis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma composed exclusively of spindle cells broadens the histologic differential diagnosis of cutaneous spindle cell malignancies and presents further diagnostic challenges.

DTC and medullary thyroid carcinomas generally have a good prognosis, but UTC are usually fatal. Consequently, there is a need for new effective therapeutic modalities to improve the survival of UTC patients. Here we show that NF-kappa B is activated in human thyroid neoplasms, particularly in undifferentiated carcinomas. Thyroid cell lines, reproducing in vitro the different thyroid neoplasias, also show basal NF-kappa B activity and resistance to drug-induced apoptosis, which correlates with the level of NF-kappa B activation. Activation of NF-kappa B in the DTC cell line NPA renders these cells resistant to drug-induced apoptosis. Stable expression of a super-repressor form of I kappa B alpha (I kappa B alpha M) in the UTC cell line FRO results in enhanced sensitivity to drug-induced apoptosis, to the loss of the ability of these cells to form colonies in soft agar, and to induce tumor growth in nude mice. In addition, we show that FRO cells display a very low JNK activity that is restored in FRO-I kappa B alpha M clones. Moreover, inhibition of JNK activity renders FRO-I kappa B alpha M clones resistant to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents. Our results indicate that NF-kappa B plays a pivotal role in thyroid carcinogenesis, being required for tumor growth and for resistance to drug-induced apoptosis, the latter function very likely through the inhibition of JNK activity. Furthermore, the strong constitutive NF-kappa B activity in human anaplastic thyroid carcinomas, besides representing a novel diagnostic tool, makes NF-kappa B a target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

Specimens were shipped in a nucleic acid stabilization solution and tested at a centralized clinical laboratory. Seventeen genetic alterations (BRAF, KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS mutations, PAX8-PPARG and RET-PTC rearrangements) were evaluated by multiplex polymerase chain reaction and liquid bead array cytometry in 769 FNAs that met inclusion criteria. Cytology, histology, and clinical care followed local procedures and practices. All results were double-blinded.;Thirty-two specimens (4.2%) failed to yield sufficient nucleic acid to generate molecular data. A single genetic alteration was detected in 80% of cytology malignant cases, 21% of indeterminate, 7.8% of nondiagnostic, and 3.5% of benign cases. Among 109 nodules with surgical histology reference standard, oncogenic mutations were present in 50% of malignant nodules missed by cytology. There were 14 cancers not identified by cytology or molecular tests, including 5 carcinomas with histologic sizes less than 1 cm (3 multifocal) and 8 noninvasive follicular variants of papillary carcinoma (4 encapsulated). No mutations were detected in 89% of the nodules benign by histopathology with 6 false-positive molecular results in 5 adenomas (2-5.5 cm) and 1 cystic nodule with an incidental papillary microcarcinoma (0.15 cm).

We performed this meta-analysis to examine the relationship between BRAFV600E mutation and the clinicopathological features of PTMC. We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library for relevant studies. We selected all the studies that reported clinicopathological features of PTMC patients with information available on BRAFV600E mutation status. Nineteen studies involving a total of 3437 patients met these selection criteria and were included in the analyses. The average prevalence of the BRAFV600E mutation was 47.48%, with no significant difference with respect to patient sex (male versus female) and age (younger than 45 years versus 45 years or older). Compared with the WT BRAF gene, the BRAFV600E mutation was associated with tumor multifocality (odds ratio (OR) 1.38; 95% CI, 1.04-1.82), extrathyroidal extension (OR 3.09; 95% CI, 2.24-4.26), lymph node metastases (OR 2.43; 95% CI, 1.28-4.60), and advanced stage (OR 2.39; 95% CI, 1.38-4.15) of PTMC.

We evaluated the associations between iodine-131 dose and the histopathological characteristics of post-Chernobyl PTCs, the changes in these characteristics over time, and their associations with selected somatic mutations.;This study included 115 PTCs diagnosed in a Ukrainian-American cohort (n=13,243) during prescreening and four successive thyroid screenings. Of these PTCs, 65 were subjected to somatic mutation profiling. All individuals were <18 years at the time of the Chernobyl accident and had direct thyroid radioactivity measurements. Statistical analyses included multivariate linear and logistic regression.;We identified a borderline significant linear-quadratic association (P=0.063) between iodine-131 dose and overall tumour invasiveness (presence of extrathyroidal extension, lymphatic/vascular invasion, and regional or distant metastases). Irrespective of dose, tumours with chromosomal rearrangements were more likely to have lymphatic/vascular invasion than tumours without chromosomal rearrangements (P=0.020) or tumours with BRAF or RAS point mutations (P=0.008). Controlling for age, there were significant time trends in decreasing tumour size (P<0.001), the extent of lymphatic/vascular invasion (P=0.005), and overall invasiveness (P=0.026).;We determined that the invasive properties of PTCs that develop in iodine-131-exposed children may be associated with radiation dose. In addition, based on a subset of cases, tumours with chromosomal rearrangements appear to have a more invasive phenotype. The increase in small, less invasive PTCs over time is a consequence of repeated screening examinations.",

Because this viewpoint is based on studies using homogenized thyroid tissue and because of TSHR fragility, we studied TSHR subunit structure in intact thyroid cells, primary human thyrocyte cultures, FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells, and WRO (follicular) and NPA (papillary) thyroid cancer cell lines. To overcome the handicap of very low TSHR expression in thyroid cells, we generated a TSHR-expressing adenovirus (TSHR-Ad-RGD) with an integrin-binding RGD motif enabling efficient entry into cells lacking the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor. Two days after TSHR-Ad-RGD infection, [125I]TSH cross-linking to intact cells revealed uncleaved, single-chain TSHR as well as cleaved TSHR A subunits on the surface of all four thyroid cell types. The extent of TSHR cleavage, which is independent of the level of TSHR expression, was consistently lower in the human thyroid cancer cell lines than in the other cell lines. In flow cytometry studies after TSHR-Ad-RGD infection, strong signals were detected in all four thyroid cell types using a monoclonal antibody that primarily recognizes the uncleaved TSHR. Finally, using the same monoclonal antibody, confocal microscopy confirmed the presence of single-chain TSHR on TSHR-Ad-RGD-infected thyroid cells. In summary, TSH covalent cross-linking, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy demonstrate the presence of uncleaved TSHR on the human thyrocyte surface. These data provide stronger evidence for this alternative than the contrary view based on the finding of only cleaved TSHR in homogenized thyroid cells.",

All tumours examined possessed TSH receptors. In most the complement was similar to that of normal thyroid tissue although all but one of the tumours had no detectable 131I concentration in vivo even with excess TSH stimulation. Elevated serum Tg (patient taking T4 in suppressive dose) was generally associated with tumours which had 131I concentrating function when stimulated by excess TSH. Some patients, however, had high serum Tg concentration but only low or indetectable tumour 131I uptake. We conclude that (a) measurement of tumour TSH receptor complement is unlikely to be useful in clinical management as tumours which do not significantly concentrate 131I in vivo may have a normal TSH receptor complement and (b) the capacity to secrete Tg is usually associated with 131I concentration but quantitatively the relationship varies considerably between tumours.",

Although differences in population iodine intake are a determinant of benign thyroid disorders, the role of iodine intake in TC remains uncertain. We review the evidence linking iodine intake and TC from animal studies, ecological studies of iodine intake and differentiated and undifferentiated TC, iodine intake and mortality from TC and occult TC at autopsy, as well as the case-control and cohort studies of TC and intake of seafood and milk products. We perform a new meta-analysis of pooled measures of effect from case-control studies of total iodine intake and TC. Finally, we examine the post-Chernobyl studies linking iodine status and risk of TC after radiation exposure. The available evidence suggests iodine deficiency is a risk factor for TC, particularly for follicular TC and possibly, for anaplastic TC. This conclusion is based on: a) consistent data showing an increase in TC (mainly follicular) in iodine deficient animals; b) a plausible mechanism (chronic TSH stimulation induced by iodine deficiency); c) consistent data from before and after studies of iodine prophylaxis showing a decrease in follicular TC and anaplastic TC; d) the indirect association between changes in iodine intake and TC mortality in the decade from 2000 to 2010; e) the autopsy studies of occult TC showing higher microcarcinoma rates with lower iodine intakes; and f) the case control studies suggesting lower risk of TC with higher total iodine intakes.

RET/PTC expression has been demonstrated to inhibit transcription of thyroid-specific genes. To study the signal transduction pathways responsible for this, we generated PCCL3 thyroid cells with doxycycline-inducible expression of RET/PTC3, RET/PTC3(Y541F), or PTC2/PDZ. Acute expression of RET/PTC(Y541F) appropriately interacted with Shc, an intermediate in the activation of the Ras pathway, but failed to activate PLCgamma. By contrast, PTC2/PDZ failed to bind Shc, but interacted normally with PLCgamma. Acute expression of RET/PTC3 or RET/PTC3(Y541F), but not PTC2/PDZ, inhibited TSH-induced Tg and NIS expression, suggesting that activation of Shc-Ras, but not PLCgamma, is required for RET/PTC-induced dedifferentiation. Accordingly, acute expression of H-Ras(V12) or of a constitutively active MEK1 also blocked TSH-induced expression of Tg and NIS. Moreover, MEK inhibitors restored Tg and NIS levels. In conclusion, activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway through Shc mediates RET/PTC-induced thyroid cell dedifferentiation. This suggests that inhibition of this pathway may promote redifferentiation in poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas with constitutive activation of either Ras or RET/PTC.",

The aim of this study was to determine if lithium treatment added to 30 mCi 131I would enhance the success rate of this treatment compared with 30 mCi 131I alone in patients who were thyroidectomized for treatment of low-risk DTC.;This was a randomized study with endpoint at one year. Sixty one consecutive patients were enrolled and randomized into two groups: group A (n=32) treated with 30 mCi 131I; group B (n=29) treated with 30 mCi 131I plus an oral dose of lithium 900 mg/day, for 7 days. All patients were evaluated by whole body scan (WBS) with 123I and had serum TSH, thyroglobulin (Tg), and anti-Tg antibodies (TgAb) determined when they were hypothyroid on no thyroid hormone. Patients were reevaluated after one year with serum TSH, Tg, and TgAb determinations and WBS with 123I. The criteria for defining a successful outcome was a negative WBS and a serum Tg of <1.;Group A was composed of 28 women and four men (ages 25-71 years) with 2 having follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), 22 having papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) of 1-4.5 cm, and 8 having micro PTCs (mPTC) of 0.3-0.8 cm. Group B was composed of 26 women and 3 men (ages 20-63 years) with 3 having FTC, 15 having PTC of 1.2-3.5 cm, and 11 having mPTC of 0.2-0.8 cm. All patients had a history of a WBS after their post-therapeutic 131I dose that showed uptake in the cervical region. After one year, 22 patients from group A had a negative WBS (68.75%) and in group B, 27 patients had a negative WBS (93.1%). The successful rates for the follow-up WBS were significantly different (p=0.017). There were 19 patients in group A in whom the initial Tg was positive. Of these, 14 had a negative follow-up Tg (73.7%).

The clinical course of this disease varies from extremely indolent tumors that can go unchanged for years to an extremely aggressive variant that is associated with a high mortality rate. As many as 75% of all medullary thyroid carcinomas are sporadic, with an average age at presentation reported as 60 years, and the remaining 25% are hereditary with an earlier age of presentation, ranging from 20 to 40 years. Germline RET proto-oncogene mutations are the genetic causes of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and a strong genotype-phenotype correlation exists, particularly between a specific RET codon mutation and the (a) age-related onset and (b) thyroid tumor progression, from C-cell hyperplasia to medullary thyroid carcinoma and, ultimately, to nodal metastases. RET mutations predispose an individual to the development of medullary thyroid carcinomas and can also influence the individual response to RET protein receptor-targeted therapies. RET codon 609 point mutations are rare genetic events belonging to the intermediate risk category for the onset of medullary thyroid carcinoma. A large genealogy resulting in a less aggressive form of medullary thyroid carcinoma is associated with the high penetrance of pheochromocytoma and has been reported in the literature. In this short review article, we comment on our previous report of a large multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A kindred with the same Cys609Ser germline RET mutation in which, conversely, the syndrome was characterized by a slightly aggressive, highly penetrant form of medullary thyroid carcinoma that was associated with low penetrance of pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism.",

The aim of this study was to validate the use of FRET on directly labeled DNA molecules to assess the frequency of positioning at <10 nm distances between genes known to be involved in rearrangement and to correlate it with their probability to undergo rearrangement. In the validation experiments, the frequency of FRET-sensitized emission (SE) was found to be 93-96% between probes for the immediately adjacent chromosomal regions as compared to 0.1-0.2% between probes for the random loci located on large linear separation. Further, we found that the frequency of FRET-SE between four pairs of genes that form rearrangements in thyroid cancer was 5% for RET and CCDC6, 4% for RET and NCOA4, 2% for BRAF and AKAP9, and 2% for NTRK1 and TPR. Moreover, the frequency with which FRET was observed showed strong correlation (r = 0.9871) with the prevalence of respective rearrangements in thyroid cancer.

A case-control study was conducted in 413 surgical cases comprising 17 distinct histopathologic categories, 244 malignant, 169 benign, and 304 double-blinded specimens. Seventeen alterations of BRAF, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, PAX8, and RET genes were evaluated using a single validated technology platform. Following verification of analytical sensitivity, accuracy, and precision in model and surgical specimens, 152 molecular positive results were generated in lesions representing multiple stages of progression and epithelial differentiation as well as rare subtypes of primary, secondary, or recurring tumors. Single mutations were found in 58% of primary malignant lesions and 12% of benign (P < .001). In the blinded validation set, mutation distribution and frequency were distinct across variants of follicular and papillary carcinomas. BRAF or RET-PTC was detected exclusively in malignant lesions but not in follicular carcinomas (P < .001).

Thyroid samples were obtained from cancer lesions (n=83) and adjacent normal tissue (n=35) in thyroid cancer patients immediately after endoscopic biopsy. BTG1 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. The effect of BTG1 overexpression was examined in vitro utilizing the human thyroid cancer cell line FTC-133, stably transfected with a recombinant lentivirus (LeBTG1 cells) and compared to empty vector transfected controls (LeEmpty). BTG1 overexpression was verified by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting. The expression of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation (cyclin D1), apoptosis (Bcl-2) and cell migration (MMP-9) in LeBTG1 cells was analyzed by western blotting. The effect of BTG1 overexpression on cell viability and proliferation was assessed by MTT assay in LeBTG1 and LeEmpty cells. Flow cytometric analyses were used to evaluate the effect of BTG1 expression on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. The migration and invasion potential of LeBTG1 cells was examined by plating cells in Matrigel-coated chambers. BTG1 protein expression was significantly lower in thyroid cancer tissue biopsies compared to normal tissue as measured by immunohistochemistry (36.1 vs. 80.0% of tissues; P<0.05) and western blotting (0.251±0.021 vs. 0.651±0.065; P<0.05). Decreased expression of BTG1 was significantly correlated with thyroid cancer lymph node metastasis, clinical stage and pathological differentiation (P<0.05), as well as with reduced overall 10‑year survival rates compared to patients with higher expression levels (30.2 vs. 66.7%; P<0.05). In vitro analyses revealed that LeBTG1 cells had a reduced survival fraction compared to control LeEmpty cells, with higher rates of apoptosis (11.6±2.1 vs. 2.1±0.4%; P<0.05). The proportion of LeBTG1 cells in G0/G1 stage and S phase was also significantly different from LeEmpty cells (81.8±6.3 and 10.2±1.0%, vs. 62.4±4.9 and 25.5±2.6%, respectively; P<0.05), and the migration and invasion of LeBTG1 cells was significantly impaired with respect to LeEmpty cells (72.0±8.0 and 55.0±7.0 vs. 113.0±16.0 and 89.0±9.0, respectively; P<0.05). These effects were accompanied by decreased protein expression of cyclin D1, Bcl-2 and MMP-9 in LeBTG1 cells (0.234±0.018, 0.209±0.021, 0.155±0.017, respectively) compared to control LeEmpty cells (0.551±0.065, 0.452±0.043, 0.609±0.072, respectively; P<0.05). Reduced BTG1 expression is associated with increased disease severity, suggesting it is a negative regulator of thyroid cancer and can serve as a prognostic indicator. ",

The study comprised five CAMSG from two males and three females, aged 21-72 years. Four tumors were localized at the base of tongue and one in the floor of mouth. At the time of diagnosis, four tumors had metastasised to regional lymph nodes. After tumor resection, two patients were treated by radiotherapy and one by chemoradiotherapy. During the follow-up (median 14 months), two patients developed lymph node metastasis. Microscopically, all tumors showed cribriform, papillary, follicular, and microcystic growth patterns. The tumor cells displayed vesicular nuclei with intranuclear grooves. Immunohistochemically, all tumors showed expression of cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK8, CK18, vimentin, smooth muscle actin, calponin, S-100 protein, and p16 protein. In addition, we observed expression of galectin-3, CK19, and HBME-1, but not of thyroglobulin and TTF-1. No mutations of RET, BRAF, K-RAS, H-RAS, and N-RAS proto-oncogenes were detected.

The objective of this study was to reappraise WDT-UMP using morphological, immunochemical, and molecular analysis and to shed more light on encapsulated thyroid follicular-patterned tumors. A total of 30 cases of WDT-UMP with equivocal papillary thyroid carcinoma-type nuclear changes (PTC-N) or focal unequivocal PTC-N were examined. As a control, follicular adenoma (n = 29), follicular carcinoma (n = 8), hyalinizing trabecular adenoma (n = 5), and PTC (n = 48) were included. HBME-1, cytokeratin 19, and galectin-3 were positive in 12 (40.0%), 10 (33.3%) and 11 (36.7%) cases of WDT-UMP, respectively. According to the positivity of those markers, significant differences were obtained between WDT-UMP and PTC encapsulated common type (P = 0.028, 0.010, and 0.004, respectively), infiltrative follicular variant (P = 0.020, 0.026, and 0.008, respectively), and infiltrative common type (P = 0.004, 0.001, and 0.005, respectively), but not between WDT-UMP and follicular adenoma or follicular carcinoma. BRAF(V600E) mutation was absent but RET/PTC1 rearrangement was found in only two (6.7%) cases of WDT-UMP. None of the 20 patients with WDT-UMP developed recurrence, with an average follow-up of 80 months. These findings indicate that WDT-UMP has a favorable outcome and is distinct from PTC in morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular characteristics.

However, there are caveats associated with the use of the molecular approach in fine-needle aspiration (FNA), particularly for RET/PTC, that should be taken into consideration. It has been claimed that a clonal or sporadic presence of this abnormality in follicular cells can distinguish between malignant and benign nodules. Nevertheless, the most commonly used PCR-based techniques lack the capacity to quantify the number of abnormal cells. Because fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the most sensitive method for detecting gene rearrangement in a single cell, we compared results from FISH and conventional RT-PCR obtained in FNA of a large cohort of consecutive patients with suspicious nodules and investigated the feasibility of setting a FISH-FNA threshold capable of distinguishing non-clonal from clonal molecular events. For this purpose, a home brew break-apart probe, able to recognize the physical breakage of RET, was designed. While a ≥3% FISH signal for broken RET was sufficient to distinguish nodules with abnormal follicular cells, only samples with a ≥6.8% break-apart FISH signal also exhibited positive RT-PCR results. On histological analysis, all nodules meeting the ≥6.8% threshold proved to be malignant. These data corroborate the power of FISH when compared with RT-PCR in quantifying the presence of RET/PTC in FNA and validate the RT-PCR efficiency in detecting clonal RET/PTC alterations. ",

Specific gene methylation occurs in certain types of thyroid cancer and depends on particular signaling pathways.

After bioinformatic analysis, these genes were found to be involved in T-cell receptor signaling pathway (B/M) and Jak-Stat signaling pathways (H/M).;Our study offers the most comprehensive DNA methylation data for thyroid disease to date, using 1 patient with 3 tissue types and high-resolution 450K arrays.

In general, pharmacological perturbation of PI3/Akt (application of MK-2206) and MEK/ERK1/2 (application of PD0325901 or U0126) signaling led to a cell line and drug-specific decrease in the proliferation and migration potential of thyroid carcinoma cells, although to a varying extent. However, one exception became apparent: in Cal-62 cells inhibition of the MEK/ERK1/2 module increased the migration rate up to 50%. This effect could be prevented by a simultaneous suppression of the PI3/Akt pathway, but also by application of the multiple kinase inhibitor sorafenib, a treatment that did not change the activation state of Akt. Thus, a pharmacological perturbation of canonical signaling pathways in thyroid carcinoma may induce drug-dependent yin-yang effects that are characterized by a simultaneous suppression of one (i.e., proliferation) and the activation of another (i.e., migration) cellular process. The appearance of such phenomena should be taken into account when therapy plans are established. ",

NF-κB inhibition was achieved by using a NF-κB inhibitor (Bay 11-7082) or by p65 siRNA transfection. Methyl-thiazolyl-tetrazolium assay was performed for cell viability assessment. DNA-binding assay, luciferase reporter assay, and Western blot were adopted to determine function and expression changes of NF-κB. Then NF-κB regulated anti-apoptotic factors XIAP, cIAP1, and Bcl-xL were measured. Apoptosis was analyzed by Western blot for caspase 3 and PARP, and by flow cytometry as well. An iodide uptake assay was performed to determine whether NF-κB inhibition could influence radioactive iodide uptake.;The methyl-thiazolyl-tetrazolium assay showed significant decrease of viable cells by combination therapy than by mono-therapies. The DNA-binding assay and luciferase reporter assay showed enhanced NF-κB function and reporter gene activities due to (131)I, yet significant suppression was achieved by NF-κB inhibition. Western blot proved (131)I could increase nuclear NF-κB concentration, while NF-κB inhibition reduced NF-κB concentration. Western blot also demonstrated significant up-regulation of XIAP, cIAP1, and Bcl-xL after (131)I therapy. And inhibition of NF-κB could significantly down-regulate these factors. Finally, synergism induced by combined therapy was displayed by significant enhancements of cleaved caspase 3 and PARP from Western blot, and of Annexin V positively staining from flow cytometry. The iodine uptake assay did not show significant changes when NF-κB was inhibited.;We demonstrated that (131)I could induce NF-κB activation, which would attenuate (131)I efficacy in DTC cells.

Intriguingly, we found that well-known cancer driver genes such as BRAF, KRAS, PTEN, and TP53 were often co-occurred with other driver genes and FMGSs size peaked at an itemset size of 3~4 genes. Besides, the number and constitution of FMGS and ARs differed greatly among different cancers and stages. In addition, FMGS and ARs were rare in endocrine-related cancers such as breast carcinoma, ovarian cystadenocarcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma, but abundant in cancers contact directly with external environments such as skin melanoma and stomach adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, we observed more rules in stage IV than in other stages, indicating that distant metastasis needed more sophisticated gene regulatory network.",

The objective of this study was to determine relationships between the b-Tg and the 72-hour rhTSH-stimulated Tg (rhTSH-Tg) using a second-generation immunochemiluminometric assay with a functional sensitivity of 0.05 ng/mL (microg/L).;Serum Tg was measured in paired b-Tg and rhTSH-Tg specimens from 1029 rhTSH tests performed on 849 TgAb-negative patients during long-term monitoring for DTC.;Basal Tg correlated with rhTSH-Tg across b-Tg concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 1000 ng/mL (microg/L) (r = 0.85, p < 0.0001). The b-Tg concentration was unrelated to age, sex, basal TSH, 72-hour TSH, or the Tg fold response (rhTSH-Tg/b-Tg). Further, only 2/655 (0.3%) tests with b-Tg below 0.1 ng/mL (microg/L) had rhTSH-Tg above 2.0 ng/mL (microg/L) (2.9 and 3.8 ng/mL [microg/L], respectively). Thirty-three patients with three or more rhTSH tests performed over a 2- to 5-year period displayed high indexes of individuality for both the 72-hour TSH and the Tg fold response (indexes of individuality = 0.30 and 0.38, respectively). Basal Tg measured using a first-generation assay with a functional sensitivity of 0.9 ng/mL (microg/L) failed to reliably detect an rhTSH-Tg response above 2.0 ng/mL (microg/L).;An rhTSH-Tg response above 2.0 ng/mL (microg/L) was highly unlikely when b-Tg was below 0.1 ng/mL (microg/L). Second-generation b-Tg measurements correlated with the degree of rhTSH-Tg stimulation and thus the likelihood of having rhTSH-Tg above the customary cut-off of 2.0 ng/mL (microg/L), whereas b-Tg measured by a first-generation assay did not. Correlations between four different assays showed that the use of a fixed Tg cut-off was influenced by assay selection. Patients receiving repetitive rhTSH tests had highly reproducible rhTSH-Tg/b-Tg fold responses, suggesting that repetitive testing is unnecessary and that second-generation measurement of b-Tg trends without rhTSH stimulation would be satisfactory for the long-term monitoring of most patients with DTC.",

Calibration of participating scanners is required to obtain comparable quantification. As determination of a well-defined range of recovery coefficients is complicated for various reasons, a simpler approach based on the assumption that the iodine uptake is highly focal with a background that significantly lacks radioactivity might be more efficient. For each scanner, a linear conversion between known and observed activity can be derived, allowing quantification that can be traced to a common source for all scanners within one study-protocol. The aim of this paper is to outline a procedure using this approach in order to set up a multicenter calibration of PET/CT scanners for (124)I.;A cylindrical polyethylene phantom contained six 2-ml vials with reference activities of ~2, 10, 20, 100, 400, and 2000 kBq, produced by dilution from a known activity. The phantom was scanned twice on PET/CT scanners of participating centers within 1 week. For each scanner, the best proportional and linear fit between measured and known activities were derived and based on statistical analyses of the results of all scanners; it was determined which fit should be applied. In addition, a Bland-Altman analysis was done on calibrated activities with respect to reference activities to asses the relative precision of the scanners.;Nine Philips (vendor A) and nine Siemens (vendor B) PET/CT scanners were calibrated in a time period of 3 days before and after the reference time. No significant differences were detected between the two subsequent scans on any scanner. Six fitted intercepts of vendor A were significantly different from zero, so the linear model was used. Intercepts ranged from -8 to 26 kBq and slopes ranged from 0.80 to 0.98. Bland-Altman analysis of calibrated and reference activities showed that the relative error of calibrated activities was smaller than that of uncalibrated activities.;A simplified multicenter calibration procedure for PET/CT scans that show highly focal uptake and negligible background is feasible and results in more precise quantification. Our procedure can be used in multicenter (124)I PET scans focusing on (recurrent) DTC.",

Our recent work has focused on new methods to radiolabel the CCK8 peptide with 111In or 99mTc for CCK-B receptor imaging. Derivatives of CCK8 were obtained by addition at the N-terminus in solid phase of a DTPA derivative (DTPAGlu) linked through a glycine spacer (DTPAGlu-G-CCK8) or cysteine, glycine and a diphenylphosphinopropionyl moiety (PhosGC-CCK8) for labeling with 111In and 99mTc, respectively. CCK-BR overexpressing A431 cancer cell lines were utilized to characterize in vitro properties of the two compounds as well as for generating xenografts in nude mice for in vivo characterization. Both 111In-DTPAGlu-G-CCK8 and 99mTcPhosGC-CCK8 showed similar binding affinities for CCK-BR with dissociation constants of 20-40 nM, were internalized after interaction with the receptor and displayed prolonged cellular retention times. Specific in vivo interaction with the receptor of both CCK8 analogs was observed in our animal model. 111In-DTPAGlu-G-CCK8 showed better target to non-target ratios, although it appeared to be rapidly metabolized after injection and activity cleared through the kidneys. 99mTc-PhosGC-CCK8 was more stable in vivo but showed marked hepatobiliary clearance with resulting high background activity in the bowel. The rapid clearance and lower background obtained with 111In-DTPAGlu-G-CCK8 make this a better candidate for further development.",

Like the other papillary thyroid carcinoma forms of Ret, Ret/ptc2 is activated through fusion of the Ret tyrosine kinase domain to the dimerization domain of another protein. Investigation of requirements for Ret/ptc2 mitogenic activity, using coexpression with dominant negative forms of Ras and Raf, indicated that these proteins are required for mitogenic signaling by Ret/ptc2. Because activation of Ras requires recruitment of Grb2 and SOS to the plasma membrane, the subcellular distribution of Ret/ptc2 was investigated, and it was found to localize to the cell periphery. This localization was mediated by association with Enigma via the Ret/ptc2 sequence containing tyrosine 586. Because Shc interacts with MEN2 forms of Ret, and because phosphorylation of Shc results in Grb2 recruitment and subsequent signaling through Ras and Raf, the potential interaction between Ret/ptc2 and Shc was investigated. The PTB domain of Shc also interacted with Ret/ptc2 at tyrosine 586, and this association resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. Coexpression of chimeric proteins demonstrated that mitogenic signaling from Ret/ptc2 required both recruitment of Shc and subcellular localization by Enigma. Because Shc and Enigma interact with the same site on a Ret/ptc2 monomer, dimerization of Ret/ptc2 allows assembly of molecular complexes that are properly localized via Enigma and transmit mitogenic signals via Shc.",

Nevertheless, not all patients with the progressive MTC respond to these drugs, requiring the development of additional therapeutic modalities that have distinct activity.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate bacterially-produced recombinant human LIF for its efficacy to suppress human MTC xenografts in mice. Here, we report that, consistent with its effects in vitro, locally or systemically administered recombinant LIF effectively suppressed growth of TT and MZ-CRC-1 xenografts in mice. Further, as predicted from its effects in TT and MZ-CRC-1 cell cultures in vitro, recombinant LIF activated the JAK/STAT pathway and downregulated RET and E2F1 expression in tumors in mice.

The principal inclusion criterion for I-131 radio-guided surgery in our protocol was the presence of an I-131 positive loco-regional disease relapse after previous total thyroidectomy and at least 2 ineffective conventional I-131 treatments. The protocol we used consisted of the following steps. Day 0: all patients were hospitalized and received a therapeutic 3.7 GBq (100 mCi) dose of I-131 after thyroid hormone therapy withdrawal in condition of overt hypothyroidism (serum TSH levels>30 microUI/ml). Day 3: a whole body scan following the therapeutic I-131 dose (TxWBS) administration was acquired. Day 5: neck surgery was performed through a wide bilateral neck exploration using a 15-mm collimated gamma probe, measuring the absolute intra-operative counts and calculating the lesion to background (L/B) ratio. Day 7: post-surgery TxWBS was performed using the remaining radioactivity to evaluate the completeness of tumoral lesions extirpation. The final histologic examination showed the presence of 184 metastatic foci; among them, 98 (53.2%) were evident by both TxWBS and gamma probe evaluation, 76 (41.3%) were demonstrated only by gamma probe, and 10 (5.4%) were negative by both TxWBS and gamma probe evaluation. During follow-up (8 months to 4.9 years, mean 2.8 years), DxWBS, serum Tg levels off l-T4, and US showed absence of loco-regional disease in 25 patients (80.6%) while 6 patients had persistent disease. In conclusion, this protocol allowed us to identify neoplastic foci with high sensitivity and specificity, enabling us to remove loco-regional I-131 disease recurrences resistant to previous conventional I-131 therapies. Furthermore, the gamma probe allowed detection of some additional tumoral foci in sclerotic areas or located behind vascular structures that were not visualized at the pre-surgery TxWBS evaluation.",

Nuclear isolation was extracted from the patient's tumor, 'normal' thyroid tissue, PBLs, and uterine leiomyoma tissue. TSH receptor (TSHR), RAS, and BRAF genes were sequenced. We searched for PAX8-PPARgamma in thyroid, PBL, and uterine leiomyoma samples from the patient and family members. Proliferative effects of detected mutants on non-transformed human thyrocytes cultures. An activating TSHR mutation, M453T, was detected in the tumor. PAX8 (exons 1-8+10)-PPARgamma was found in all tested patient's tissues. A second rearrangement, PAX8 (exons 1-8)-PPARgamma, was detected in the patient's normal thyroid tissue. Under deprived medium condition, co-transfection of PAX8-PPARgamma and TSHR-M453T dramatically increased the number of thyrocytes, an effect that it was not observed with TSHR wild-type (WT); under complete medium conditions, co-transfection of PAX8-PPARgamma with either TSHR-M453T or TSHR-WT inhibited cell proliferation. We report a patient with hyperthyroidism due to a FTC bearing an activating TSHR mutation and PAX8-PPARgamma rearrangements. PAX8-PPARgamma was present as a mosaicism affecting tissues from endodermal and mesodermal origin. PAX8-PPARgamma and TSHR-M453T inhibited or promoted thyrocyte proliferation depending on medium conditions.

Transformation of melanocytes gives rise to melanoma. In two thirds of melanomas, the serine/threonine kinase B-RAF is mutated to a constitutively active form. Here, we show that FOXD3 levels are upregulated following attenuation of B-RAF and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) signaling in mutant B-RAF harboring human melanoma cells. This effect was selective because FOXD3 was not upregulated following MEK inhibition in wild-type B-RAF melanoma cells and mutant B-RAF thyroid carcinoma cells. Ectopic FOXD3 expression potently inhibited melanoma cell growth without altering mutant B-RAF activation of ERK1/2. Inhibition of cell growth was due to a potent G(1) cell cycle arrest and was associated with p53-dependent upregulation of p21(Cip1). FOXD3-induced cell cycle arrest was prevented by p53 depletion and, to a lesser extent, p21(Cip1) depletion. These studies show that FOXD3 is suppressed by B-RAF, uncover a novel role and mechanism for FOXD3 as a negative cell cycle regulator, and have implications for the repression of melanocytic lineage cells.",

There are two major benefits from this clinical practice: (a) the surgeon is alerted to the need to perform total thyroidectomy and central compartment lymphadenectomy, which is the minimal surgical treatment for MTC; and (b) the outcome of MTC is favourably affected because it is usually identified at a less advanced stage. However, other non-MTC causes of hypercalcitoninaemia and false sCT positivity do exist and must be recognized.

HSP90 is an emerging therapeutic target of interest for the treatment of cancer and is responsible for modulating cellular response to stress by maintaining the function of signalling proteins. In this study, we have worked with B-CPAP, a thyroid papillary cancer cell line which is known to have BRAF V600E mutation. We have administered the flavonoid Quercetin, which is known to induce apoptosis by inhibiting HSP production on various cancer cell lines, at different concentrations (between 10 and 75µM) for 24hours. We have measured cell viability using WST-1 assay. We found that the viability decreases in a dose dependent manner. Then, we chose Quercetin concentrations between 10-75µM for 24hours, for the apoptosis and cell cycle analysis in flow cytometry by Annexin V and propidium iodide. We have also applied Hoechst stain to cancer cells for visualizing them on fluorescence microscopy and confirmed apoptosis with the presence of apoptotic signs in nuclei of cancer cells. Finally, we used Western blotting to compare HSP90 and Cleaved-PARP levels in cells treated with Quercetin and the control group. In the light of the obtained data, our results suggest that in future studies it would be useful to investigate the apoptotic mechanisms of Quercetin and use combinational therapies on BCPAP cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"We have shown that boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) could be an alternative for the treatment of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC). Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) like sodium butyrate (NaB) cause hyperacetylation of histone proteins and show capacity to increase the gamma irradiation effect. The purpose of these studies was to investigate the use of the NaB as a radiosensitizer of the BNCT for PDTC. Follicular thyroid carcinoma cells (WRO) and rat thyroid epithelial cells (FRTL-5) were incubated with 1 mM NaB and then treated with boronophenylalanine ¹⁰BPA (10 μg ¹⁰B ml⁻¹) + neutrons, or with 2, 4-bis (α,β-dihydroxyethyl)-deutero-porphyrin IX ¹⁰BOPP (10 μg ¹⁰B ml⁻¹) + neutrons, or with a neutron beam alone. The cells were irradiated in the thermal column facility of the RA-3 reactor (flux = (1.0 ± 0.1) × 10¹⁰ n cm⁻² s⁻¹). Cell survival decreased as a function of the physical absorbed dose in both cell lines. Moreover, the addition of NaB decreased cell survival (p < 0.05) in WRO cells incubated with both boron compounds. NaB increased the percentage of necrotic and apoptotic cells in both BNCT groups (p < 0.05). An accumulation of cells in G2/M phase at 24 h was observed for all the irradiated groups and the addition of NaB increased this percentage. Biodistribution studies of BPA (350 mg kg⁻¹ body weight) 24 h after NaB injection were performed. The in vivo studies showed that NaB treatment increases the amount of boron in the tumor at 2-h post-BPA injection (p < 0.01). We conclude that NaB could be used as a radiosensitizer for the treatment of thyroid carcinoma by BNCT.",

Activity of commonly used chemotherapy (doxorubicin) is low, thus more active compounds need to be introduced into the therapeutic concept of ATC. Recently, based on preclinical data Ain et al. conducted a clinical phase II study with paclitaxel 96 h infusion in ATC achieving a promising response rate of 53%. To further improve therapeutic options in ATC, we evaluated the activity of topotecan, oxaliplatin, vinorelbine, gemcitabine and paclitaxel in comparision to cisplatin and doxorubicin (1 and 96 h drug exposure) alone or in combination in the ATC cell lines SW1736 and 8505C. IC50 values were determined by the sulforhodamine B assay, potential clinical activity was estimated by relative antitumor activity (RAA) and drug interaction was analyzed using a parametric response surface approach (Greco model) of the Loewe additivity. Duration of drug effect was estimated by regrowth kinetics. We found paclitaxel, vinorelbine and gemcitabine active in ATC with RAA (1 h drug exposure) ranging from 86 to 454, 15 to 17 and 31 to 140, respectively. The activity of doxorubicin and cisplatin was moderate with RAA ranging from 1.4 to 2.2 and 0.2 to 0.3, respectively. Combined drug exposure of gemcitabine/paclitaxel and gemcitabine/vinorelbine was synergistic with a Loewe index > 0. However, these results did not reach statistical significance with p > 0.05. At clinically relevant drug concentrations paclitaxel, gemcitabine and vinorelbine but not oxaliplatin exerted a sustained growth inhibition after cessation of drug exposure for the complete assay time of 15 days. In conclusion, paclitaxel, gemcitabine and vinorelbine but not topotecan or oxaliplatin appeared to be active in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma based on RAA or growth delay at clinically relevant drug concentrations. Combinations of vinorelbine/gemcitabine and paclitaxel/gemcitabine exerted a trend to synergy. Thus, further evaluation of paclitaxel, vinorelbine and gemcitabine alone or in combination with ATC seems warranted.",

MTC can occur sporadically (75%) or as part of inherited cancer syndromes (25%). In most cases, hereditary MTC evolves from preneoplastic C cell hyperplasia (CCH), so early detection of this pathology would evidently be critical. A recent study reports that alterations in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) D are responsible for familial non-RET CCH. First, we studied SDHD in two families with hereditary non-RET CCH and found no alterations related to the inheritance of this disease. Then, we investigated whether the H50R variant could be a risk factor in the sporadic development of MTC in both Spanish and English patients. We found no evidence that the presence of the H50R is strongly associated with the risk of sporadic MTC, although we did observe an association with age at diagnosis of MTC in Spanish H50R carriers that we did not find in English patients. Finally, we looked for evidence of CCH or any other thyroid disease in a panel of germ-line SDH (B or D) mutation carriers and found none. We conclude that SDHD variants do not constitute a risk factor for developing CCH or sporadic MTC.",

A calibration factor of 301 cpm/MBq (d = 16 cm) is used for the probe for estimates of whole body activity. Patients sit in a rotating stool with their center corresponding to the field of view for estimation of whole body RAI. Radioactive counts are obtained for anterio posterior (AP) and postero anterior (PA) geometries. Whole body retention factor is expressed as a ratio against assayed activity administered to the patient on day 1. With exposure rate measurement, for off-thyroxin (hypothyriod) patients, the retention factors were 0.148 ± 0.12 (n = 211) and 0.07 ± 0.08 (n = 68) at 48 h and 72 h, respectively. For recombinant TSH (rhTSH) (euthyroid) group, the retention factors were 0.089 ± 0.06 (n = 24) and 0.05 ± 0.05 (n = 19) at 48 h and 72 h, respectively. By probe counting method, the obtained retention factors were 0.081 ± 0.013 (range: 0.071-0.096) (off-thyroxine group) and 0.039 ± 0.03 (range: 0.008-0.089) for the rhTSH group at 48 h. The 72 h retentions in the off thyroxine (hypothyriod) group and the rhTSH (euthyroid) group were 0.048 ± 0.024 (range: 0.016-0.076) and 0.005, respectively. The radioactive body burdens at 48 h were in the range of 290-315 MBq (7.8-8.5 mCi) for the off-thyroxine group and 44-286 MBq (1.2-7.7 mCi) for the rhTSH group. The calculated residence times in whole body were 21.97 ± 3.8 h (range: 17.1-27.1) for off-thyroxine group and 14.28 ± 2.75 h (range: 9.97-19.46) showing high statistical significance (P < 0.001). The specific blood doses were 0.118 ± 0.025 mGy/MBq (range: 0.083-0.172) for the off-thyroxine group (females n = 23); 0.87 ± 0.028 mGy/MBq (range: 0.057-0.130) (females n = 13), 0.080 ± 0.013 mGy/MBq (range: 0.069-0.098) (males n = 5) and 0.080 ± 0.028 (range: 0.059-0.118 for rhTSH patients (males n = 4).

The dose to blood was \"inversely proportional\" to the body weight, both in the off-thyroxine group and the rhTSH group but the dependence was not very strong with rhTSH administration because of less residence time of the radioactive iodine.

The diagnosis of metastasis to the thyroid has important therapeutic and prognostic implications. To our knowledge, a morphologic and immunophenotypic comparison of metastatic ductal carcinoma of the breast and primary thyroid carcinomas has not been reported. Here, we report the case of a 37-year-old female with a history of metastatic ductal carcinoma of the breast (modified Bloom-Richardson grade 2; ER+, PgR+, HER2+) diagnosed 6 years prior. She developed hoarseness, prompting a CT scan. Multiple thyroid nodules were found, including a 1.5 cm hypoechoic, solid, irregularly-shaped nodule. On FNA, cells were arranged singly and in crowded groups, varied in size and degree of pleomorphism, and exhibited rare nuclear grooves, inconspicuous nucleoli, and rare intracytoplasmic lumina with no nuclear pseudoinclusions or colloid (Figs. 1A and B). These findings raised the differential of papillary thyroid carcinoma (Fig. 1C), follicular neoplasm (Fig. 1D), medullary carcinoma (Fig. 1E), parathyroid (Fig. 1F), and metastatic breast carcinoma. Immunostaining for GATA-3 (+), ER (+), PAX-8 (-), and TTF-1 (-) was consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma (Fig. 2). We conclude that metastatic breast carcinoma to the thyroid may morphologically mimic primary thyroid carcinoma on FNA; a panel of immunomarkers, such as GATA-3, hormonal marker(s), PAX-8, and TTF-1, may be useful in some cases. GATA-3 immunostaining for metastatic breast carcinoma was helpful in our case and has not been previously reported in a thyroid metastasis sampled by FNA. Diagn.

Changes in cell viability and the extents of necrosis and apoptosis were evaluated both immediately and 2 days after irradiation.;Viability of B-CPAP cells diminished with increasing I activity concentration. No apoptosis was detectable immediately after irradiation. Two days after irradiation significant apoptosis was found. The lowest I activity concentration at which apoptosis was detectable corresponds to about 1 MBq . ml. At higher activity concentrations a larger percentage of cells became apoptotic but the proportion decreased again at activity concentrations >10 MBq . ml. Likewise, necrosis was minimal at low activity concentrations and showed an exponential increase with rising I activity concentrations (>5-10 MBq . ml). Necrosis was already detectable immediately after irradiation and was the predominant form of cell death at high activity concentrations.;The data suggest that the nature of the cytotoxic effect of I and whether it leads to apoptotic or necrotic cell death is dose-dependent. High I doses seem to produce mainly necrotic phenomena, whereas at low I activity concentrations apoptotic phenomena prevail. The predominance of delayed apoptosis could explain why radioiodine therapy at lower doses is often linked to delayed onset and possible continuation of thyroid volume reduction over some months and even up to a year.",

This depends on the function of the thyroid cells and on the rate that radioactivity is excreted from the blood. The reduction of radioiodine is described by the effective half-life (EHL), which is the time taken to half the retained radioactivity. If the tumor recurs, more treatments are prescribed, often with escalating activities. Patients may receive several treatments during the evolution of the disease, and the total radioactivity administered (TRA) is the sum of all such activities. The patients' archived information permitted the calculation of EHL and TRA. The patient cohort processed here comprised 274 females and 101 males treated during 1997 to 2015. The TRA to the patients ranged between 1.1 and 129.5 GBq (average = 7.93 ± 9.9 GBq) and the EHL varied between 5.06 and 43.87 hours (average = 14.13 ± 5.7 hours). The data were processed as follows: (a) the EHL corresponding to the last treatment of each patient was plotted against TRA to patients who were treated once and to those treated several times for comparison and (b) using a small subgroup of 16 patients who were treated at least 5 times, the EHL and TRA corresponding to each treatment of each patient were plotted. A function of the form y = p-k·ln(x) was fitted on the data in all graphs and k was calculated. For patients treated once, EHL was independent of TRA. A decrease was seen in (a) multitreated patients, with the gradient (k) ranging between -0.541 and -13.880 and (b) 13 out of 16 patients, with the gradient (k) ranging between -5.55 and -31.17, both indicating an impairment of the remnant function, perhaps identified as \"stunning.\" Since this is not avoidable, the uptake may be boosted by splitting the prescribed activity into low radioactivity fractions, which will also reduce patient hospitalization.

Unfortunately, fine-needle aspiration biopsies are indeterminate in 20%-30% of patients, often necessitating thyroid surgery for diagnosis. Numerous DNA microarray studies including a recently commercialized molecular classifier have helped to better distinguish benign from malignant thyroid nodules. Unfortunately, these assays often require probes for >100 genes, are expensive, and only available at a few laboratories. We sought to validate these DNA microarray assays at the protein level and determine whether simple and widely available immunohistochemical biomarkers alone could distinguish benign from malignant thyroid nodules.;A tissue microarray (TMA) composed of 26 follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs) and 53 follicular adenomas (FAs) from patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules was stained with 17 immunohistochemical biomarkers selected based on prior DNA microarray studies. Antibodies used included galectin 3, growth and differentiation factor 15, protein convertase 2, cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase 1 (GOT1), trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), Friedreich Ataxia gene (X123), fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13), carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4), crystallin alpha-B (CRYAB), peptidylprolyl isomerase F (PPIF), asparagine synthase (ASNS), sodium channel, non-voltage gated, 1 alpha subunit (SCNN1A), frizzled homolog 1 (FZD1), tyrosine related protein 1 (TYRP1), E cadherin, type 1 (ECAD), and thyroid hormone receptor associated protein 220 (TRAP220). Of note, two of these biomarkers (GOT1 and CD44) are now used in the Afirma classifier assay. We chose to compare specifically FTC versus FA rather than include all histologic categories to create a more uniform immunohistochemical comparison. In addition, we have found that most papillary thyroid carcinoma could often be reasonably distinguished from benign disease by morphological cytology findings alone.;Increased immunoreactivity of CRYAB was associated with thyroid malignancy (c-statistic, 0.644; negative predictive value [NPV], 0.90) and loss of immunoreactivity of CA4 was also associated with malignancy (c-statistic, 0.715; NPV, 0.90) in indeterminate thyroid specimens. The combination of CA4 and CRYAB for discriminating FTC from FA resulted in a better c-statistic of 0.75, sensitivity of 0.76, specificity of 0.59, positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.32, and NPV of 0.91. When comparing widely angioinvasive FTC from FA, the resultant c-statistic improved to 0.84, sensitivity of 0.75, specificity of 0.76, PPV of 0.11, and NPV of 0.99.;Loss of CA4 and increase in CRYAB immunoreactivity distinguish FTC from FA in indeterminate thyroid nodules on a thyroid TMA with an NPV of 91%. Further studies in preoperative patient fine needle aspiration (FNAs) are needed to validate these results.",

However, negative testing does not exclude malignancy. The study objective was to identify clinical and imaging features that predict cancer in mutation-negative AUS/FLUS thyroid nodules.;All patients were reviewed (April 2007 to April 2009) who had AUS/FLUS cytology, negative prospective molecular testing of FNA, and histopathology.;Of the 230 nodules, 12 (5.2%) were malignant in 11 of 190 patients, and known clinical risk factors for thyroid cancer did not predict malignancy. On preoperative imaging, ≥1 suspicious ultrasound feature was identified in 33% of nodules and occurred regardless of histology (P = .23). Malignant mutation-negative AUS/FLUS nodules were larger than benign nodules (mean maximum diameter, 33.6 vs 24.0 mm; P = .007). On multivariate analysis, nodule size remained an independent predictor of malignancy (odds ratio, 1.043; P = .018). We observed no malignancies in 88 mutation-negative AUS/FLUS nodules <18.5 mm.;Size is an independent predictor of malignancy in mutation-negative AUS/FLUS nodules and the risk increased 4.3% with every millimeter increase in nodule size.

A distinction, however, is that RET/PTCs induce immunostimulatory programs, suggesting that, in the case of this tumor type, the additional pro-inflammatory pathway reduces aggressiveness. Here, we demonstrate that pro-inflammatory programs are selectively activated by TRAF2 and TRAF6 association with RET/PTC oncoproteins. Eliminating this mechanism reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production without decreasing transformation efficiency. Conversely, ablating MEK/ERK or PI3K/AKT signaling eliminates transformation but not pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Functional uncoupling of the two pathways demonstrates that intrinsic pro-inflammatory pathways are not required for cellular transformation and suggests a need for further investigation into the role inflammation plays in thyroid tumor progression.",

Here we show that nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB is activated in RET-associated C-cell carcinoma specimens. TT cells, a human MTC cell line expressing MEN 2A type RET, display transcriptionally active RelA(p65) in the nucleus. NF-kappaB activity in these cells is attributable to constitutive IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity and high turn over of IkappaBalpha. RET harboring the mutations C634R (MEN 2A) or M918T (MEN 2B), in contrast to wild-type RET, activates a NF-kappaB-dependent reporter construct upon transient transfection in HeLa cells. We show that the prototype RET mutation C634R enhances phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha by IKKbeta but not by IKKalpha. RET-induced NF-kappaB and IKKbeta activity requires Ras function but does neither involve the classical mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase nor the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathways. In contrast, RET-induced NF-kappaB activity is dependent on Raf and MEKK1. Inhibition of constitutive NF-kappaB activity results in cell death of TT cells and blocks focus formation induced by oncogenic forms of RET in NIH 3T3 cells. These results suggest that RET-mediated carcinogenesis critically depends on IKK activity and subsequent NF-kappaB activation.",

In this study, we try to understand the influence of (131)I radioablation on the important lymphocytes subtypes of regulatory T and B cells (Tregs and Bregs). Methods. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 30 PTC patients before and after (131)I therapy, and 20 healthy donors were collected. The expression of Tregs (CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-/low)) and B cell (CD5(+)CD19(+)) and production and secretion of interleukin 10 (IL-10) were analyzed by FACS and ELISA assay, respectively. Results. For Tregs percentage in peripheral blood lymphocytes, there was no difference between pretreatment and control and between posttreatment and control. Compared with pretherapy, increased Tregs infiltration was noted in posttherapy (P < 0.05). Although no difference was between pretreatment and control, compared with these two groups, decreased CD19(+) and CD5(+)CD19(+) B cell percentage in posttreatment was observed (P < 0.05). Among these groups, no significant difference was displayed in intracellular IL-10 production and extracellular IL-10 secretion. Conclusions. (131)I Radioablation increased Tregs and decreased CD19(+) and CD5(+)CD19(+) B cells percentage after treatment. However, it has no effect on IL-10 and lymphocytes in peripheral blood. Therefore, longer follow-up of Tregs and Bregs should be further investigated. ",

Traditionally, this has been achieved by withdrawing L-thyroxine (L-T4) for 4-6 weeks, inducing hypothyroidism in patients. The availability of a genetically engineered version of the recombinant human TSH (rh-TSH) provides an alternative tool to enhance the TSH serum level without inducing hypothyroidism. In this paper the I remnant and red-marrow doses calculated in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients pre-treated with rh-TSH are compared to those calculated in patients in hypothyroidism induced by L-T4 withdrawal.;Forty-six DTC patients, submitted to I ablative therapy, were randomly divided in group A (pre-treated with rh-TSH) and group B (treated after L-T4 withdrawal for 30 days). The red-marrow absorbed dose per unit administered activity and the remnant cumulated activity per unit administered activity were calculated for both groups.;The red-marrow dose in 17 rh-TSH treated patients is 0.06+/-0.02 mGy.MBq; that in 14 hypothyroid patients is 0.09+/-0.03 mGy.MBq (two-tailed unpaired t-test P=0.003). The remnant cumulated activity per unit administered activity in 10 rh-TSH treated patients is 0.9+/-0.8 h; that calculated in 21 hypothyroid patients is 1.55+/-1.05 h (two-tailed unpaired t-test P=0.063). This last result is mainly due to the difference between the maximum uptake (U) in rh-TSH (U=0.01+/-0.01) and hypothyroid patients (U=0.03+/-0.02) (two-tailed unpaired t-test P=0.019).;The rh-TSH pre-treated patients seem to have a lower uptake compared to those in hypothyroidism induced by L-T4 withdrawal. On the other hand their red-marrow absorbed dose seems to be lower.",

The proper management of such patients has been uncertain, but most investigators have advocated repeat testing and evaluation after an interval of several months. The present study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic implications of these modest increases in plasma calcitonin. In 25 kindred members at direct risk for familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), basal peripheral plasma calcitonin (CT) levels were less than 240 pg/ml. Following provocative testing with intravenous calcium or pentagastrin or both, calcitonin values remained below 240 pg/ml in eight subjects (Group A), however, they were mildly elevated (260-580 pg/ml) in 12 subjects (Group B) and moderately elevated (700-940 pg/ml) in five subjects (Group C). Following the transfemoral placement of a catheter into the inferior thyroid vein (ITV), provocative testing was repeated, and ITV and peripheral blood samples were collected simultaneously. Basal ITV plasma CT levels were below 240 pg/ml in all patients in Group A, however, they were mildly elevated (500 pg/ml) in one of the 12 patients in Group B and moderately elevated (800 pg/ml, 1400 pg/ml) in two of the five patients in Group C. Following provocation, ITV plasma CT levels became markedly elevated in one patient in Group A and in all of the patients in Groups B(2520+/-635 pg/ml) and C (6322+/-2598 pg/ml). Thyroidectomy was performed in patients whose ITV plasma CT level was elevated following provocative testing. Medullary thyroid carcinoma of C-cell hyperplasia were evident either on microscopic (1/1 patient in Group A;9/12 patients in Group B; and 2/5 patients in Group C), or gross (3/12 patients in Group B;3/5 patients in Group C) examination of thyroidectomy specimens. In only one of 14 patients was metastatic MTC noted on histologic examination of resected cervical lymph nodes. Postoperative peripheral plasma CT levels were unchanged from basal and less than 240 pg/ml following provocative testing in all but one patient. The present study then provides definitive evidence that patients at direct risk for familial MTC who have even minimally abnormal responses in peripheral plasma CT following provocative testing generally harbor some stage of a C-cell proliferative disorder.

No KRAS, RET/PTC, or PAX8/PPARgamma genetic alteration was detected.

Twenty thyroid cancer patients were entered in the study after total thyroidectomy: ten patients (group A) underwent whole-body scintigraphy with 185 MBq of (131)I and the other ten (group B) received 3700 MBq of (131)I therapy. All patients were in a hypothyroid state at the time of administration of (131)I and started L-thyroxine 150 microg/day 3 days after (131)I administration. Free and bound triiodothyronine and thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroglobulin, thyroglobulin antibodies, thyroid peroxidase/microsomal antibodies, white blood cell, lymphocyte counts and lymphocyte subsets were serially determined at baseline and at days 2, 7, 15, 30 and 60 after (131)I administration. Twenty healthy age- and sex-matched individuals were used as a reference population for lymphocyte subset values. In group A only a reduction in NK cells at days 7 (P=0.043) and 15 (P=0.037) was observed. In group B, patients showed a delayed reduction in the total lymphocyte count at days 15, 30 and 60 (P=0.008, 0.004 and 0. 018, respectively), and a decrease in B cells throughout the study (at days 7, 15, 30 and 60: P=0.006, 0.0017, 0.0017 and 0.0017 respectively). A transient decrease in NK cells was observed at days 15 (P=0.025) and 30 (P=0.008). Among T cells, the helper phenotype (CD4+) was mainly affected, resulting in a reduction in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio at day 60 (P=0.046). Comparing the two groups, the numbers of B lymphocytes at day 30 (P=0.023) and NK cells at days 2 (P=0.037) and 30 (P=0.023) were significantly lower in group B. Neither group showed any clinical sign of immunosuppression during the follow-up period. In patients with thyroid cancer the sensitivity of lymphocytes to the effects of (131)I administered for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes depends upon lymphocyte phenotype and (131)I activity. NK cells are the most radiosensitive cells, being reduced even by low (131)I activity. At higher activity all subtypes show a reduction, which is more marked and prolonged for B lymphocytes and, to a lesser extent, for T-helper lymphocytes. These changes do not result in clinically relevant immunosuppression.",

Amino acid sequences from one form of purified rat MTC alpha-amidating enzyme have been utilized to design oligonucleotide probes for isolating cDNAs encoding this protein. Sequence analysis of multiple cDNA clones indicates that there are at least two types of cDNA in rat tissues. These cDNAs differ primarily by the absence (type A) or the presence (type B) of a 315-base internal sequence. Additional heterogeneity in the 3' coding regions of the different mRNAs has also been found. Both types of cDNA predict primary translation products that are preproenzymes which must be post-translationally processed at both their amino and carboxyl termini. Sequence analysis of the purified peak III protein from rat MTC demonstrates that the type A mRNA encodes this 75-kDa protein. This analysis also provides support for the assignment of the C-terminal processing site. In addition, data are presented which demonstrate that type B mRNA is also functional.

Over the last decade, a number of small-molecule inhibitors of Aurora kinases have been developed, which have proved to efficiently restrain malignant cell growth and tumorigenicity. Regarding medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), we previously showed the efficacy of a pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor (MK-0457) in impairing growth and survival of the MTC-derived cell line TT. In the present study, we sought to establish if one of the Aurora kinases might represent a preferential target for MTC therapy. The effects of selective inhibitors of Aurora-A (MLN8237) and Aurora-B (AZD1152) were analyzed on TT cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and ploidy. The two inhibitors reduced TT cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with IC50 of 19.0 ± 2.4 nM for MLN8237 and 401.6 ± 44.1 nM for AZD1152. Immunofluorescence experiments confirmed that AZD1152 inhibited phosphorylation of histone H3 (Ser10) by Aurora-B, while it did not affect Aurora-A autophosphorylation. MLN8237 inhibited Aurora-A autophosphorylation as expected, but at concentrations required to achieve the maximum antiproliferative effects it also abolished H3 (Ser10) phosphorylation. Cytofluorimetry experiments showed that both inhibitors induced accumulation of cells in G2/M phase and increased the subG0/G1 fraction and polyploidy. Finally, both inhibitors triggered apoptosis. We demonstrated that inhibition of either Aurora-A or Aurora-B has antiproliferative effects on TT cells, and thus it would be worthwhile to further investigate the therapeutical potential of Aurora kinase inhibitors in MTC treatment.",

In most of the studies, planar imaging was performed for comparison using thallium-201 chloride or technetium-99m 2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile ((99m)Tc-MIBI). Furthermore, FDG-PET studies were not always performed in the hypothyroid state with increased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which are known to increase FDG uptake by DTC. The aim of this study was to compare the ability of FDG-PET to detect metastatic DTC with that of (99m)Tc-MIBI whole-body single-photon emission tomography (SPET) and post-therapeutic iodine-131 scintigraphy, evaluated under TSH stimulation. Nineteen patients (8 men, 11 women; age range, 38-72 years, mean 60 years; 17 thyroidectomised and 2 inoperable patients following (131)I ablation of the remaining thyroid tissue; 16 papillary and 3 follicular carcinomas) with metastatic DTC underwent FDG-PET whole-body scan (WBS) and (99m)Tc-MIBI SPET WBS at an interval of less than 1 week, followed by (131)I therapy. The SPET images were reconstructed using the maximum likelihood expectation maximisation (ML-EM) method. All patients were hypothyroid at the time of each scan. (131)I WBS was performed 3-5 days after oral administration of the therapeutic dose. A total of 32 lesions [10 lymph node (LN), 15 lung, 6 bone, 1 muscle] were diagnosed as metastases, as confirmed by histopathology and/or other imaging modalities (X-ray, US, CT, MRI, bone, (201)Tl and (131)I scans).

Activation of protein kinase B (PKB) and its downstream signaling pathways appears to be an important event in thyroid tumorigenesis. In this study, we found that the thyroid-specific oncogenic RET/PTC tyrosine kinase is able to phosphorylate PKB in vitro and in vivo. RET/PTC-transfected cells showed tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous and exogenous PKB, which was independent of phosphorylation of T308 and S473 regulated by the upstream kinases phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and -2, respectively. The PKB Y315 residue, which is known to be phosphorylated by Src tyrosine kinase, was also a major site of phosphorylation by RET/PTC. RET/PTC-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation results in the activation of PKB kinase activity. The activation of PKB by RET/PTC blocked the activity of the forkhead transcription factor, FKHRL1, but a Y315F mutant of PKB failed to inhibit FKHRL1 activity. In summary, these observations suggest that RET/PTC is able to phosphorylate the Y315 residue of PKB, an event that results in maximal activation of PKB for RET/PTC-induced thyroid tumorigenesis.",

HT is an autoimmune disease in which a breakdown of immune tolerance is caused by interplay of a variety of immunologic, genetic, and environmental factors. Thyrocyte injury resulting from environmental factors results in expression of new or hidden epitopes that leads to proliferation of autoreactive T and B cells. Infiltration of thyroid by these cells results in HT. In addition to the usual type of HT, several variants such as the fibrous type and Riedal thyroiditis are also recognized. The most recently recognized variant is immunoglobulin G4(+) HT, which may occur as isolated thyroid limited disease or as part of a generalized Ig4-related sclerosing disease. The relationship between HT and Riedel thyroiditis remains unclear; however, recent evidence seems to suggest that it may also be part of the spectrum of Ig4-related sclerosing disease. HT is frequently associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma and may indeed be a risk factor for developing this type of cancer. The relationship between thyroid lymphoma and HT on the other hand appears well established.",

The authors compared the sensitivity of In-111-based SRS, F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), and extensive conventional radiographic imaging (CRI) in this type of cancer.;SRS, FDG PET, and CRI were performed concurrently in 21 patients (age, 56.4 +/- 12.9 years) who had aggressive TCA. Concordance rates % of lesion positivity among pairs of different techniques (A and B) were calculated as the ratio of the number of lesions positive with both techniques divided by the sum of the total number of lesions positive with technique A + total number of lesions positive with technique B, which was then multiplied by 200.;The combined use of CRI, FDG PET, and SRS resulted in the detection of 105 lesions, presumed to be due to metastatic deposits. Sensitivities for SRS and FDG-PET imaging were 49.5% and 67.6%, respectively. The lesion detection concordance rates were as follows: CRI versus FDG PET, 80.8%; CRI versus SRS, 74.2%; and FDG-PET versus SRS, 58.6%. Importantly, SRS detected five unexpected lesions, which were negative by both CRI and FDG-PET imaging. In two representative patients, a positive correlation (Spearman's rank = 0.71; = 0.0576) existed between the percentage of lesional In-111 DTPA octreotide uptake and the standard uptake value in eight concordant lesions.;Although SRS has only moderate sensitivity for disease detection in metastatic TCA, sometimes it can reveal lesions that otherwise would be undetectable by either CRI or FDG-PET imaging.",

Around 2000 cells were then distributed in 12-well plates and grown for 48 h in either DMEM (thyroid cancer cells) or in RPMI medium (MCF 7 cells) both containing 5% FCS. Thereafter, different concentrations of iodide, iodine or delta-iodolactone were added for 24 h. Growth rate was estimated by cell counting in a Coulter Counter adapted for epithelial cells. Apoptosis was determined by a mitochondrial potential assay.;The growth rate of B-CPAP cells was unaffected by iodide, but was reduced by high concentreations of molecular iodine (100 and 500 microM). However, delta-iodolactone significantly reduced cell proliferation already with low concentrations (5 microM and 10 microM) and further in a dose-dependent manner up to 82%. FTC-133 and 8505C cells were unaffected by iodide, iodine or delta-iodolactone. In contrast, in MCF 7 cells, molecular iodine (100 microM) inhibited growth from 100% to 83% but delta-iodolactone (1, 5 and 10 microM) dose-dependently decreased growth rate from 100% to 82% and 62%, respectively. The inhibition of growth was through apoptosis, and not necrosis, as the amount of apoptotic cells corresponded to the growth inhibition.;delta-Iotaodolactone seems to be the main iodocompound which can inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in B-CPAP cells as well as in MCF 7 breast cancer cells.",

This suggests that local anticancer factors, generated in lymph nodes, control PTC progression. The cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), may be one such factor. We have previously shown that a human PTC cell line (NP-PTC) has high affinity TNF-alpha receptors. We now report on the action of TNF-alpha in these cells. TNF-alpha decreased [3H]thymidine incorporation as well as cellular DNA content and cell number in a dose-dependent manner. The abundance of phosphodiesterase and manganous superoxide dismutase mRNA species was increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner in the NP-PTC cells after TNF-alpha treatment. TNF-alpha activated NF-kappa B, a nuclear factor thought to mediate multiple actions of TNF-alpha, in these cells with a maximum effect observed after 30 min of treatment. Thus, TNF-alpha has an antiproliferative action on NP-PTC cells, despite its ability to induce the accumulation of mRNA that encodes an enzyme (manganous superoxide dismutase), thought to be cytoprotective. The net antiproliferative effect must therefore be explained by a balance of protective and tumoricidal or static effects that ultimately result in control of tumor spread. These antiproliferative effects may be in part mediated by NF-kappa B and PDE.",

Numerous studies worldwide have reported comparable results with recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone (rhTSH) intervention as conventional thyroxine hormone withdrawal. Radiation safety applications call for the need to understand radioactive (131)I (RA(131)I) clearance pattern to estimate whole body doses when this new methodology is used in our institution. A study of radiation body burden estimation was undertaken in two groups of patients treated with RA(131)I; (a) one group of patients having thyroxine medication suspended for 5 weeks prior to therapy and (b) in the other group retaining thyroxine support with two rhTSH injections prior to therapy with RA(131)I. Sequential exposure rates at 1 m in the air were measured in these patients using a digital auto-ranging beta gamma survey instrument calibrated for measurement of exposure rates. The mean measured exposure rates at 1 m in μSv/h immediately after administration and at 24 h intervals until 3 days are used for calculating of effective ½ time of clearance of administered activity in both groups of patients, 81 patients in conventionally treated group (stop thyroxine) and 22 patients with rhTSH administration. The (131)I activities ranged from 2.6 to 7.9 GBq. The mean administered (131)I activities were 4.24 ± 0.95 GBq (n = 81) in \"stop hormone\" group and 5.11 ± 1.40 GBq (n = 22) in rhTSH group.

Beyond 48 h post administration, clearance of RA(131)I takes place with T½eff> 20 h in both groups. Neck and stomach exposure rate measurements showed reduced uptakes in the neck for rhTSH patients compared with \"stop thyroxine\" group and results are comparable with other studies. Whole body clearance is faster for patients with rhTSH injection, resulting in less whole body absorbed doses, and dose to blood. These patients clear circulatory radioactivity faster, enabling them to be discharged sooner, thus reduce costs of the hospitalization. Reduction in background whole body count rate may improve the residual thyroid images in whole body scan. rhTSH provides TSH stimulation without withdrawal of thyroid hormone and hence can help patients to take up therapy without hormone deficient problems in the withdrawn period prior to RA(131)I therapy. This also will help in reducing the restriction time periods for patients to mix up with the general population and children. ",

This is due to alternative splice/polyadenylation events that lead to the predominant synthesis of two long isoforms in naive T cells and a shorter NF-ATc isoform in effector T cells. Whereas the previously described isoform NF-ATc/A contains a relatively short C terminus, the longer isoforms, B and C, span extra C-terminal peptides of 128 and 246 aa, respectively. We show here that in addition to the strong N-terminal trans-activation domain, TAD-A, which is common to all three NF-ATc isoforms, NF-ATc/C contains a second trans-activation domain, TAD-B, in its C-terminal peptide. Various stimuli of T cells that induce the activity of TAD-A also enhance the activity of TAD-B, but, unlike TAD-A, TAD-B remains unphosphorylated by protein from 12-O-tetradecanoyl 12-phorbol 13-acetate-stimulated T cells. The shorter C-terminal peptide of isoform NF-ATc/B exerts a suppressive transcriptional effect. These properties of NF-ATc/B and -C might be of importance for gene regulation in naive T lymphocytes in which NF-ATc/B and -C are predominantly synthesized.",

Taken together, these data provide new evidence of a novel role for uPAR induction (as a consequence of constitutive ERK1/2 activation) as a central component in PTC pathogenesis, and highlight the potential of uPAR as a therapeutic target.",

During the past several years, a plan for evaluating patients with dominant thyroid masses has evolved. The objective is to avoid unnecessary operations by identifying patients with a high risk of cancer. The criteria which are used are the age and sex of the patient, the duration of the mass, 125I or 99mTc scans, 75Selenomethionine scans, B-mode ultrasonography and the response of the mass to suppressive therapy. This is a report of the findings in 222 patients who have been studied employing this approach. Thirty per cent of the patients were operated upon. Forty per cent had neoplasms (well differentiated cancer--28.8%, adenoma--12.1%), 47.0%--nodular goiter, 6.1% cysts, and 6.1% chronic thyroiditis. The incidence of cancer in the 222 patients was 8.6% and adenoma 3.6%. Patients at greatest risk of having cancer are those with solid nonfunctioning nodules which fail to regress with suppressive therapy.

Therefore we have commenced a thyroid ultrasound examination (TUE) survey of the approximately 360,000 pediatric inhabitants (0 to 18 years of age) who lived in Fukushima at the time of the accident in October 2011. The subjects were divided into three categories according to the standardized diagnostic criteria of ultrasound findings. Category A contained the subjects whose TUE findings were intact or benign. Category B were recommended a confirmatory TUE. Category C was recommended an immediate confirmatory TUE.;The survey of 40,302 subjects in the first year was completed in March, 2013. There were 40,097 (99.5%), 205 (0.50%) and 0 subjects in categories A, B and C, respectively. Of the 82 category B subjects who underwent fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), 12 were diagnosed with a malignant tumor or were suspected to have malignancy. The 12 subjects received thyroid surgery and 11 thyroid cancers and one benign nodule were confirmed histologically after surgery.

The period under study was divided into two sections: phase A (1995-1999) and phase B (2000-2005).

Overall histopathological diagnoses were nodular goiter (54.9%), hyperplastic nodules (14.7%), adenoma (8.3%), thyroid cancer (18.2%), and Hashimoto thyroiditis (3.8%). Total thyroidectomy was performed in 91 patients in phase A versus 115 patients in phase B (P < 0.001), whereas the use of subtotal thyroidectomy and lobectomy decreased over time.

NPA cell growth factor activity largely eluted with 0.5 mol/L NaCl from a heparin-Sepharose column. NPA-conditioned medium competed in a platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) RRA, and the mitogenic activity was partially blocked by an anti-PDGF-BB antibody. An immunoprecipitated PDGF-B-like protein from NPA cells was about 17 kilodaltons in a reducing gel, but, in contrast to wild-type PDGF-BB, did not change its electrophoretic mobility in an unreduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. NPA cells expressed an abundant 1.4-kilobase RNA that hybridized to probes for the 5'-untranslated and amino-terminal domains of PDGF-B and was distinct from the 4.2-kilobase wild-type PDGF-B chain transcript. There were no structural changes in the PDGF-B gene, as determined by cytogenetic analysis and restriction mapping. However, the PDGF-B gene in the NPA cells was hypomethylated compared to that in normal thyroid tissue or WRO cells. In contrast, the mitogenic activity of WRO cells bound to heparin with high affinity and was blocked by a basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) antibody. WRO cells contained abundant bFGF mRNA. Both cell lines abundantly expressed transforming growth factor-beta mRNA. Thus, NPA and WRO cells express powerful, yet distinct, mesenchymal cell growth factors. Whereas WRO cells express abundant bFGF, NPA cells produce a novel PDGF-B-like protein, which may correspond to a mutated form of PDGF-B-chain.",

The deduced amino acid sequences of the mitochondrial and plastidic isoforms exhibit high homology even with respect to the presequences. The predicted presequence of AtCS-C has a N-terminal extension of 33 amino acids when compared to the plastidic isoform. Northern blot analysis showed that AtCS-C is higher expressed in roots than in leaves whereas the expression of AtCS-B is stronger in leaves. Furthermore, gene expression of both genes was enhanced by sulfur limitation which in turn led to an increase in enzyme activity in crude extracts of plants. Expression of the AtCS-B gene is regulated by light. The mitochondrial, plastidic and cytosolic (Hesse and Altmann, 1995) isoforms of cysteine synthase of Arabidopsis are able to complement a cysteine synthase-deficient mutant of Escherichia coli unable to grow on minimal medium without cysteine, indicating synthesis of functional plant proteins in the bacterium. Two lines of evidence proved that AtCS-C encodes a mitochondrial form of cysteine synthase; first, import of in vitro translation products derived from AtCS-C in isolated intact mitochondria and second, Western blot analysis of mitochondria isolated from transgenic tobacco plants expressing AtCS-C cDNA/c-myc DNA fusion protein.",

The biological reasons for these irregularities are obscure, but evidence has been presented that they might be linked to RET÷PTC gene translocation. In the present study, we have investigated the hypothesis that the NM irregularities in PTC might be linked to alterations in the expression of lamin B receptor (LBR), a component of the inner NM responsible for the distribution of Lamin B and associated chromatin. Fisher AH et al. already reported on the lack of LBR in PTC, a finding in contrast with the observation that a reduced expression of LBR because of gene mutation is responsible for the lack of nuclear segmentation of granulocytes in Pelger-Huët anomaly. In the present study, we confirmed the lack of immunohistochemical staining for LBR in PTC nuclei, in contrast to a positive staining in intestinal epithelium and stromal cells. However, Western blot and RT-PCR analysis demonstrated a strongly positive reaction in PTC extracts, thus proving an expression of LBR higher in PTC cases and cells than in follicular carcinoma cells. In conclusion, our data suggest that LBR is heavily expressed in PTC cells, but an abnormal folding of the protein might explain its lack of immunohistochemical reactivity and be associated with the anomalous folding of the NM.",

They are found overexpressed in several human malignancies, including the papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). In the present study, we sought to establish whether Aurora kinase inhibition could be of any therapeutic value in the treatment of aggressive forms of PTC, enduring to radioactive iodide (RAI) ablation. To this end, the effects of selective inhibitors of Aurora-A (MLN8237) and Aurora-B (AZD1152) were analyzed on 3 human PTC cell lines expressing either wild-type (K1 and TPC1) or mutant p53 (BCPAP). The two inhibitors were capable of reducing cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with IC₅₀ comprised between 65.4 and 114.9 nM for MLN8237, and between 26.6 and 484.6 nM for AZD1152. Immunofluorescence experiments confirmed that AZD1152 inhibited Aurora-B phosphorylation of histone H3 on Ser10, however, it did not affect Aurora-A autophosphorylation. MLN8237 inhibited Aurora-A autophosphorylation as expected, but at concentrations required to achieve the maximum antiproliferative effects it also abolished H3 (Ser10) phosphorylation. Time-lapse videomicroscopy evidenced that both inhibitors prevented the completion of cytokinesis, and cytofluorimetric analysis showed accumulation of cells in G2/M phase and/or polyploidy. Apoptosis was induced in all the cells by both inhibitors independently from the p53 status. In conclusion, in the present preclinical study MLN8237 and AZD1152 have emerged as promising drug candidates for RAI-insensitive PTC.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Parafollicular (PF) cells have been found to be a good model system for the study of serotonergic cellular mechanisms relevant to neurons. PF cells are derived from the same region of the neural crest that gives rise to the neurons of the gut and are capable of extending neurofilament-bearing neuritic processes. PF cells also synthesize 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and costore 5-HT in the same vesicles as the specific 5-HT-binding protein, 45 kDa SBP. A hypothesis has been advanced that PF cells and enteric neurons share a common developmental precursor. The present investigation was undertaken in order to determine whether a human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) cell line, which is derived from PF cells, sufficiently mimics PF cells that it can be substituted for them in investigations of serotonergic cellular biology. In contrast to PF cells, MTC cells can be propagated in vitro to provide adequate amounts of material for biochemical studies. MTC cells were found to contain neuropeptides, including calcitonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and somatostatin, which have also been reported to be present in PF cells and enteric neurons. MTC cells also were observed to store endogenous 5-HT, to be able to synthesize 3H-5-HT from 3H-L-tryptophan, and to take up 3H-5-HT from the ambient medium by a carrier-mediated mechanism very similar to that of serotonergic neurons. In addition, the longterm accumulation of 3H-5-HT in MTC cells was antagonized by reserpine, suggesting that the cells contain 5-HT storage vesicles that, like the synaptic vesicles of serotonergic neurons, are characterized by a reserpine-sensitive transporter of biogenic amines. MTC cells also contain type A, but not type B, monoamine oxidase. Finally, MTC cells were found to contain both 45 and 56 kDa SBP. MTC cells thus retain a great many of the properties of PF cells, and, like PF cells, they are serotonergic cells with characteristics similar to serotonergic neurons. Substantial differences were found in the content of immunoreactive 5-HT and neuropeptides in individual MTC cells. Moreover, the release of newly synthesized 5-HT to the medium exceeded the ability of the cells to store the amine. Studies of the ultrastructure of the MTC cells revealed a limited and highly variable number of secretory granules, probably accounting for their limited 5-HT storage capacity and for the heterogeneity of immunostaining with antisera to 5-HT or neuropeptides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The aim of this study was to analyze whether these subgroups are clinically different. A retrospective analysis of clinicopathological data of patients with pT3 PTC, with a minimum follow-up of 2 years, at a referral center was conducted. Outcome was evaluated after primary treatment and after 2 and 5 years of follow-up. Patients were classified as no evidence of disease (NED), biochemical evidence of disease (BED), and structural evidence of disease (SED) either locoregional (SED-L) or at distance (SED-D). The study patients were classified into three groups as follows: Group A (n = 91), Group B (n = 101), and Group C (n = 23). Most patients were female (80.0 %); mean age at diagnosis was 49.9 ± 16.5 years. 214 patients underwent total thyroidectomy; 208 patients were treated with (131)I. Median follow-up was 6.0 years.

To address this, we expressed RP3 in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking key classical and noncanonical NF-κB signaling components. In wild-type MEFs, RP3 upregulated CCL2, CXCL1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and tumor necrosis factor expression and activated classical but not noncanonical NF-κB. RP3-activated NF-κB in IκB kinase (IKK)β(-/-) MEFs but not IKKα- or NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)-deficient cells and activation was inhibited by a peptide that blocks NEMO binding to the IKKs. RP3 increased the levels of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and did not activate NF-κB in NIK-deficient MEFs. Notably, NIK stabilization was not accompanied by TRAF3 degradation demonstrating that RP3 disrupts normal basal NIK regulation. Dominant-negative NIK blocked RP3-induced NF-κB activation and an RP3 signaling mutant (RP3(Y588F)) did not stabilize NIK. Finally, examination of PTC specimens revealed strong positive staining for NIK. We therefore conclude that RP3 activates classical NF-κB via NIK, NEMO and IKKα. Importantly, our findings reveal a novel mechanism for oncogene-induced NF-κB activation via stabilization of NIK.",

At the same time, cell surface nucleolin is also over-expressed in PTC and others. Interestingly, a few reports suggest that either CXCR4 or cell surface nucleolin is a co-receptor for HIV-1 entry into CD4+ T cells, which indicates that there is a relationship between CXCR4 and nucleolin. In this study, antibody and siRNA were used to identify effects of cell surface nucleolin and CXCR4 on cell signaling; soft-agar colony formation assay and Transwell assay were used to determine roles of nucleolin and CXCR4 in cell proliferation and migration. Importantly, co-immunoprecipitation was used to demonstrate the relationship between CXCR4 and nucleolin. Results showed CXCR4 and nucleolin were co-expressed in PTC cell line K1, B-CPAP, and TPC-1. Either cell surface nucleolin or CXCR4 was necessary to prompt extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. When blocked, CXCR4 or nucleolin can significantly affect TPC-1 proliferation and migration (p < 0.01). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis identified that nucleolin can bind and interact with CXCR4 to activate CXCR4 signaling. This study suggests that nucleolin is crucial in the activation of CXCR4 signaling, which affects cell growth, migration, and invasiveness. Further, nucleolin may interact with other receptors. Our study also offers new ideas for cancer therapy. ",

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess whether I-131 ablation during rhTSH stimulus can be improved by reducing the circulating iodine pool and by increasing thyroid cell uptake and retention of I-131 obtained by administering furosemide and lithium.;A total of 201 consecutive DTC patients were entered in the study: they were treated by total thyroidectomy and I-131 therapy during rhTSH stimulus to ablate thyroid remnants. Patients were divided into two groups according to the TNM stage: group 1 included patients in stage I-II who were treated with a low 30-mCi I-131 dose, while group 2 included patients in stage III-IV who were treated by a high 100-mCi I-131 dose. Moreover, both groups were further subdivided into three subgroups. Subgroup (a) included 45 patients from group 1 and 22 from group 2: they were treated with I-131 under rhTSH stimulus, following a short 4-day withdrawal of L-thyroxine (LT4). Subgroup (b) included 45 patients from group 1 and 22 from group 2: they were treated with I-131 under rhTSH stimulus, following a short 4-day withdrawal of L-T4, and after furosemide administration (25 mg/day orally) during the 3 days before I-131. Subgroup (c) included 45 patients from group 1 and 22 from group 2: they were treated with I-131 under rhTSH stimulus, following a short 4-day L-T4 withdrawal, and after administration of furosemide (25 mg/day orally) during the 3 days prior I-131 and lithium (450 mg/day orally) during the 3 days following I-131. Another group (group 3) of 20 patients characterized by a very low-risk cancer (unifocal tumor <1.0 cm in diameter, without extra-capsular extension, N0) was treated with a 30-mCi I-131 dose under rhTSH stimulus without performing the short 4-day L-4 withdrawal: this group was taken as the control. Follow-up was performed by neck ultrasonography (US), and Tg measurement and I-131 WBS under rhTSH stimulus.;Among the patients from group 1, those pre-treated with furosemide or with furosemide plus lithium showed a better outcome of ablation both in terms of undetectable Tg values (97.7% and 95.5 % vs. 79.5%, p < 0.05) and of WBS negativity (97.7% vs. 81.8%, p < 0.05) during the rhTSH stimulus. No similar findings were observed in group 2 patients. Moreover, in patients from group 3 (I-131 30 mCi, without L-T4 withdrawal), the outcome of ablation was significantly lower in comparison to patients from group 1 (I-131 30 mCi, with L-T4 withdrawal) in terms of undetectable Tg during the rhTSH stimulus (55.0%, p < 0.001).;rhTSH is highly effective for post-surgical thyroid remnant ablation in low-risk cancer patients using the low 30-mCi dose protocol combined with the short 4-day withdrawal of L-T4.

The pattern of mediastinal uptake could vary based upon the pattern of thymic hyperplasia in an individual case. Three different patterns of mediastinal uptake were observed in the cases described in the present report. Recognizing the patterns and the clinical settings (where this was to be suspected by the treating physician) was important to obviate unnecessary aggressive treatment, such as, surgery or radioiodine therapy. In a review of the literature, we found that a majority of the cases were reported in the young population (related to the thymus reaching its peak size during adolescence and gradual atrophy in the following decades) and in patients undergoing a six-month follow-up whole body diagnostic scan after thyroid remnant ablation treatment, and also in patients receiving a second course of 131-iodine treatment for a persistently elevated thyroglobulin (Tg) level. The indicators that should raise the suspicion of false-positive radioiodine uptake to the attending physician include: (a) undetectable/low serum thyroglobulin level (although this may not be always the case, depending on the clinical setting), (b) a well-controlled disease with no other abnormal focus in the rest of the body,",

Our results show that (1) the TSHR(M623) or (M632) cDNAs give rise to 3T3 clones presenting a fully neoplastic phenotype (growth in agar and nude mouse tumorigenesis); this phenotype was weaker in the cells transformed by the 632 cDNA; (2) suggest that the fully transformed phenotype of our 3T3 cells, may be the consequence of the additive effect of the activation of at least two different pathways: the cAMP pathway through G(alpha)s and the Ras dependent MAPK pathway through G(beta)gamma and PI3K and (3) show that the PI3K isoform playing a key role as an effector in the MAPK pathway activation in our 3T3-transformed cells is PI3Kgamma. Signaling from PI3Kgamma to MAPK appears to require in our murine cellular system a tyrosine kinase (still not characterized), Shc, Grb2, Sos, Ras and Raf. It is proposed that the constitutively activated TSHR genes detected in the thyroid carcinomas, may have played an oncogenic role, participating in their development through these two pathways.",

Two hundred unrelated healthy individuals were typed as controls.;Compared with the controls, the HLA-B*51:01 (8.8% vs. 4.5%, p=0.029, OR 2.039 [CI 1.101-3.775]) and HLA-C*07:06 (2.6% vs. 0.5%, p=0.024, OR 5.307 [CI 1.119-25.171]) allele frequencies were higher in the PTC patients, while the HLA-C*07:01 (1.3% vs. 6.0%, p=0.001, OR 0.206 [CI 0.071-0.601]) allele frequency was lower in the PTC patients that did not persist after Bonferroni correction for multiple tests. This showed no statistically significant correlation of the HLA-A, -DRB1, and -DQB1 alleles and PTC. The incidence of PTC was more frequent in females between 30 and 60 years old. There were no significant differences in the age and sex distributions between the total and the HLA-B*51:01 positive PTC patients.;The HLA associations in this Chinese Han population differ markedly from studies done in Europeans and Caucasians.

From 1999 to 2002, LND of the central compartment (compartment A) was performed in 39 patients. Among this group, additional MRND of the ipsilateral compartment (compartment B) and the contralateral compartment (compartment C) was performed in 29 and 15 patients respectively, who met the selection criteria. The mean number of nodes resected was 11 (5-22) in compartment A, 23 (8-37) in compartment B, and 22 (10-31) in compartment C. Histopathologic findings revealed node invasion of compartment A in 25 patients (64.1%), of A and B in 20 patients (51,2%) and of A, B, and C in 13 patients (33.3%). From the 25 patients with metastases in compartment A, 80% (20 patients) already had metastases in compartment B and 52% (13 patients) had metastases in all three compartments. All patients free of metastasis (M0) in compartment A were also metastasis free in both lateral compartments. Postoperative whole-body scanning I(131) in M0 patients showed no uptake at all. Mapping of the cervical anatomy in compartments seems to be a useful taxonomy for clarifying the lymphatic spread of PTC. Patients having PTC without metastasis in compartment A are almost certainly disease free at the time of operation. Lymph node metastasis in the central compartment appears to be a valuable indicator of lymphatic invasion of the lateral compartment and a strong indication for performance of a unilateral or bilateral MRND to complete the surgical removal of tumor.",

Morphological studies and expression of tumor markers in this cell line have been reported previously, but no detailed characterization on the origin of the chromosome markers is available. B-CPAP cells have a rather stable hypertriploid karyotype, with chromosome polysomies and structural chromosome abnormalities featuring whole chromosome arm imbalances. Chromosome banding revealed a main clone with nine chromosome markers, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole chromosome paint (wcp), partial chromosome paint (pcp), and centromeric probes clarified their origin. The use of centromeric probes provided accurate refinement of the rearrangements classified as whole-arm translocations by banding and FISH with wcp probes. Both chromosomal and array-based comparative genomic hybridization experiments confirmed the cytogenetic characterization of this cell line. Moreover, the use of fluorescence immunophenotyping and interphase cytogenetics as a tool for the investigation of neoplasms (FICTION) technique, which simultaneously shows nuclear ploidy and cytoplasmic immunofluorescence, detailed the oncocytic feature of the cells. Intriguingly, despite their origin, they lack most of the features expressed in papillary thyroid tumor cells and have a chromosomal pattern reminiscent of that of a subgroup of oncocytic malignant thyroid tumors.",

After ATC expansion, the cells were armed with CD20Bi. Killing activity was evaluated by 51Cr-release assay.;Arming ATC with as little as 5 ng CD20Bi/10(6) cells significantly increased cytotoxicity above unarmed ATC. CD20Bi-armed ATC (50 ng/10(6) cells) efficiently lysed CD20+ cell lines at E:T of 6.25-50, but not the nonhematologic, CD20- SK-BR-3 cell line. High levels of cytotoxicity mediated by CD20Bi-armed ATC (p < 0.05) could not be blocked by an 8000-fold excess of soluble rituximab.

The therapeutic procedure consists of a) thyroid blockade; b) administration of high specific activity 131I-MIBG; c) single doses, varying from 3.7 to 9.5 GBq, given by slow i.v. infusion (2-3 hours); d) monitoring of the patient during the infusion of the tracer. Targeted radiotherapy with 131I-MIBG in malignant pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, carcinoids and medullary thyroid carcinomas, was shown to be effective with partial reduction of tumoral lesions (mainly in pheochromocytomas with 58% of objective responses) and palliation in metastatic tumors; in a few pheochromocytomas also succeed in eradicating the residual/recurrent tumor. In patients with stage IV NB who failed to respond to or relapsed after conventional chemotherapy, MIBG therapy showed an important palliative role. A significant therapeutic improvement in the outcome of stage III and IV NB patients was obtained by introducing 131I-MIBG as a first line therapy, partial or even complete responses occurring in more than 60% of the cases treated. Experiences combining chemotherapeutic agents and 131I-MIBG are also in progress with encouraging results. MIBG therapy is well tolerated; toxicity is limited to minor hematologic toxicity and patients generally recover spontaneously. The risk of pancytopenia rises in patients with bone and/or bone marrow metastases; in these cases bone marrow harvesting is recommended. An alternative approach to 131I-MIBG therapy in MTC uses radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies. A novel immunotargeting method, which includes a bispecific antibody and 131I as a radiolabel, seems to be very promising.",

These results do not support previously published predictions that lamin A/C expression is related to a loss of proliferative activity. At least three LAP2 isoforms are identified in normal and neoplastic thyroid. LBR is sparse or undetectable in all the thyroid samples.

Iodine intake modifies the expression of thyroid diseases and has been associated with induction of AITD. Thyroglobulin (Tg) is an important target in iodine-induced autoimmune response due to post-translational modifications of iodinated Tg, as suggested in animal models. We have shown that the unmasking of a cryptic epitope on Tg contributes to iodine-induced thyroid autoimmunity in humans. The relationship between AITD and PTC has been suggested in many studies. The presence of two different mechanisms has been hypothesized, one typical of AITD and the other of an immune reaction to PTC. We have shown that in AITD, the pattern of Tg recognition by anti-Tg antibodies (TgAb) is 'restricted' to the immunodominant regions of Tg, while in patients with non-AITD, such as nodular goiter and PTC devoid of thyroid lymphocytic infiltration at histology, TgAb show a less restricted epitopic pattern and bind also to other regions of Tg. Thyroid function may also affect the frequency of PTC, the risk of cancer increasing with serum TSH levels. We have shown that this mechanism, rather than thyroiditis per se, plays a major role in the association of PTC with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, as a consequence of the autoimmune process leading to a progressive increase of serum TSH in these patients.

From absorption titration experiments with Mg2+, we conclude that binding of one [atc-Mg]+ complex in the homodimer causes changes in the protein conformation around the second binding pocket. In the presence of absence of Mg2+, several different groups of atc-protein arrangements must exist, each with a characteristic atc fluorescence decay time. Taking into account the results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we propose as one possible origin for such a differentiation teh extent of hydrogen bonding between atc and the surrounding amino acids. Binding of Mg2+ should change the arrangement of the surrounding amino acids such that some of the excited atc molecules do not undergo the relaxation process typical for free atc. The MD simulations also show that the pattern of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the two monomeric units is no correlated, thereby leading to different fluorescence kinetics for atc in the two monomeric units. Furthermore, it is suggested that hydrogen bonding between Arg104 and O10 of anhydrotetracycline could regulate the relaxation processes of excited anhydrotetracycline.",

A line of evidence suggested that the development and the aggressiveness of MTC in the different cancer syndromes is variable. Aim of this study was to compare the phenotype of exon 13-15 mutations with that of exon 11 mutation and possibly draw therapeutical consequences.;We compared the phenotype of 47 patients with mutations in exon 13-15 with 66 patients with exon 11, codon 634 mutation, the classical MEN2A.

Elderly patients have more severe disease and more complications following postoperative endocrine therapy to control thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. We aimed to identify optimal postoperative serum TSH levels in elderly patients to prevent recurrence and metastasis and minimize complications. This retrospective cohort study collected data of 87 consecutive elderly patients (age >75) who underwent surgery for PTC with postoperative levothyroxine therapy (50-150 μg/d) between January 2006 and June 2008 and were followed until 2013. After 24 patients with TSH fluctuations and incomplete data were excluded, 73 patients were grouped based on postoperative TSH levels: Group A, 0.3-0.5 mIU/mL; Group B, 0.1-0.3 mIU/mL; and Group C <0.1 mIU/mL (n = 24, 25, 24, respectively). Subjects' baseline, preoperative data, postoperative complications and 1-, 3- and 5-year follow-up data were compared between groups. No significant differences in gender, age (median age of 80 years old), surgery type or clinical characteristics were found between groups (all p value >0.05). Postoperatively, all subjects had normal ECG and neck ultrasound, no osteoporosis, and no differences in survival rate or metastasis. Five-year follow-up revealed significant differences in development of arrhythmias, osteoporosis, insomnia and anxiety between Groups B (0.1-0.3 mIU/mL) and C (<0.1 mIU/mL) compared to Group A (0.3-0.5 mIU/mL). Postoperative incidence of PTC recurrence and metastasis remained stable in elderly patients undergoing thyroid surgery and endocrine therapy but complications increased significantly with increasing TSH levels. Controlling TSH to lower limits of normal may help prevent PTC recurrence and metastasis and reduce complications in this high-risk population.",

Highly potent antigen-presenting cells, namely dendritic cells (DCs), may serve as an interesting tool for anticancer vaccination. Here we report on the IN VITRO findings of a vaccination trial in five MTC patients, who were treated with a new DC generation protocol consisting of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interferon-alpha (IFN-DCs). These cells were pulsed with tumor-specific calcitonin and administered twice. In two patients who responded to therapy we found a large increase (in mean 2.9+/-1.9%) of antigen-specific IFN-gamma-secreting CD4+ cells as well as an increase of granzyme B positive CD8+ cells (mean 2.2+/-0.2%) in the peripheral blood. In parallel, a decrease of CD4+/CD25+/FoxP3+ regulatory T cells was seen. Importantly, IN VITRO stimulation of PBMC with 10 different 15mer calcitonin peptides resulted in the identification of two HLA class II epitope regions within the central part of full-length calcitonin. These data were in accordance with the results drawn from the computer-based algorithm epitope prediction software SYFPEITHI. Measurement of different pro- and anti-angiogenic factors did not allow for a distinct outcome of prediction of the treated patients. In summary, we have demonstrated that immunization with IFN-DCs leads to a tumor epitope-specific immune response in MTC patients and may, therefore, represent a promising tool for future vaccination trials.",

Two lexical methods were used to map ATC to UMLS. The first approach used a French natural language processing tool to map French terms of ATC to the French terminologies of UMLS. The second approach used the MetaMap tool to map English terms of ATC to UMLS. The English MetaMap provides slightly more mappings than the French NLP tool (3,170 vs. 2,992). On the other hand, the French NLP tool provides a slightly better precision than MetaMap (88% vs. 86%). Using a manual mapping between ATC and MeSH, the union of the validated mappings between ATC and MeSH provides 2,824 mappings (68.7% of ATC codes of the fifth level).

The lymphoma was of type V (Bryon's classification) with predominant B cells, and was associated, as in previously reported cases, with a peripheral blood T lymphocyte deficiency. This case was unusual, in that autopsy revealed an active multivisceral sarcoidosis (considered as being cured more than 10 years previously), a clear-cell renal adenoma demonstrating nearly all the characteristics of a Grawitz's tumor, and a papillary epithelioma of the thyroid gland. These findings lead to discuss the significance of immuno-surveillance lack in this particular case: was it dependent on the sarcoidosis (during which a reduction in T lymphocytes is known to occur), or was it primary and perhaps genetic, a son of the patient having Hodgkin's disease? Whatever the case may be, the encephalic proliferation of the B lymphocyte clone, the peripheral epitheliomas, the sarcoidosis, and the deficit in T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood constitute a group of factors singularly rich in questions, this being, apparently, the first case of this type reported in the published literature.",

Radioiodine uptake in metastatic lesions is greater in younger patients than in older ones. Hypothyroidism is often mild or even absent in patients with a large amount of tumor tissue, indicating that thyroid hormones produced by highly differentiated tumors compensate partially or even completely for hypothyroidism following total thyroidectomy. Adequate uptake of 131I has been reported to be associated with significant reduction in the size and number of metastases, and with lower recurrence and higher survival rates. Other favorable factors for longer survival are younger age, well-differentiated histological type, small disease extent, and early discovery of metastases. Older patients with extensive metastases and/or bulky tumor masses in the bone have a poor prognosis. Therefore, it is important to discover metastases as early as possible, when patients are still young. Long-term follow-up with periodic thyroglobulin measurements and imaging studies is strongly recommended. In Japan, 131I treatment for Graves' disease is performed only in selected patients in whom antithyroid drugs cannot be used because of side effects or not effective, considering the high prevalence of permanent hypothyroidism. 89SrCl3 is useful for reducing pain due to bone metastases of malignant tumors. 131I-MIBG therapy is effective for improvement of QOL in some patients with metastatic malignant pheochromocytoma.

For some 25 years, elevated serum concentrations of Tg therefore have been employed as a post-operative marker for well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The aim of serum Tg measurement is to identify patients requiring: A) further testing to confirm the presence and to determine the stage, site and functionality of tumour; and/or B) further treatment. Serum Tg testing has the advantages of superior sensitivity to radioiodine whole-body scanning (WBS), lack of false positive readings, simplicity, speed, low cost, precision and wide availability. However, major limitations of serum Tg testing are interference by serum anti-Tg antibodies and decreased sensitivity during THST. To obviate this last drawback, the use of recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) has been clinically investigated as a preparative adjunct to serum Tg testing in the diagnostic follow-up of well-differentiated thyroid cancer. A large, multicentre international Phase III study now has confirmed evidence from earlier Phase I/II and Phase III trials and established the safety and efficacy of rhTSH in stimulating Tg release by residual and neoplastic thyroid tissue. This confirmatory study has clearly shown that 1) rhTSH administration significantly increases sensitivity of serum Tg measurement in patients on THST; and 2) by permitting sensitive diagnostic follow-up with serum Tg measurement and/or radioiodine WBS during THST, rhTSH administration improves patient comfort and quality of life compared to THST withdrawal. Thus use of the drug in diagnostic follow-up recently has received regulatory approval in the United States, and such approval is pending in the European Union. With regulatory approval, rhTSH is likely to gain an important role as a preparative adjunct to serum Tg testing in everyday practice.",

The study population consisted of 70 patients who underwent initial thyroidectomy before 2004 and had DM beyond the locoregional neck area. Of these 70 patients, 40 patients were diagnosed with DM before or within 9 months after initial thyroidectomy in first radioactive iodide (I) whole-body scintigraphy (group A), and 30 patients were diagnosed with DM during the follow-up period (group B). Patients with DM underwent 3.7 to 7.4 GBq I therapy every 6 to 12 months. After a mean follow-up period of 10.1 ± 0.9 years, the disease-specific mortality and remission rates were 70.0% (49/70) and 10% (7/70), respectively. The survival rates for patients in groups A and B were 72.5% and 96.7% at 1 year, 47.5% and 90.0% at 5 years, 40.0% and 70.0% at 10 years, 36.4% and 41.1% at 15 years, and 35.0% and 8.0% at 20 years, respectively. The percentage of male and older patients and patients with larger tumor size was higher in the mortality group than in the survival group, whereas the percentage of patients with I avid metastatic lesions (first DM) was lower in the mortality group. The percentage of patients with secondary primary cancers was higher in group B than in group A. In the multiple regression analysis, age and male gender were independently associated with disease-specific mortality. In conclusion, after a mean follow-up of 10.1 years, the disease-specific mortality rate for PTC with DM was 70.0%. Older patients and male PTC patients with DM need more aggressive treatment. The timing of DM diagnosis did not influence disease-specific mortality.",

SWE elasticity indices (EI) of mean (Emean), minimum (Emin), maximum (Emax) and the ratio of Emean in LNs and surrounding muscle (Emean-m) were measured at the stiffest portion of LNs (kPa). SWE EI were correlated with the pathologic diagnosis and the histopathologic findings, including number and size of metastatic LNs, the ratio of the number of metastatic LN/dissected LN, and the presence of extranodal extension. Diagnostic performances of SWE EI and BUS for predicting LN metastasis were assessed using receiver operating curve analysis.;All SWE EI were significantly higher in metastatic LNs than in benign LNs (p < 0.005). Combined Emean [area under the curve (AUC) 0.811] or Emin (AUC 0.812) with BUS showed significantly higher AUC than BUS (0.738) for predicting metastatic LNs (p = 0.041 and 0.033, respectively). The number of positive LNs/dissected LNs and the largest LN size were significantly correlated with SWE EI (p < 0.05 and p < 0.005, respectively). Metastatic LNs with extranodal extension showed significantly higher SWE EI (p < 0.005) than those without extranodal extension.;Combined use of SWE and BUS was adjunctive to the diagnostic performance of BUS for the prediction of LN metastasis of PTC, and quantitative SWE could predict pathologic prognostic factors of LN metastasis of PTC.",

The procedure allows pathologic staging of lymph nodes of the central compartment and treatment of the micrometastases. Nevertheless, the morbidity that its routine use adds to the total thyroidectomy must be taken into account. The aim of this study was to characterize the morbidity that CND adds to the total thyroidectomy.;This was a retrospective study of 1087 patients with PTC and clinically negative neck lymph nodes. Patients were divided into three study groups: Group A, total thyroidectomy; Group B, total thyroidectomy and ipsilateral CND; Group C, total thyroidectomy and bilateral CND. Primary endpoints of the study were evaluated by comparing the rates of transient and permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury and hypoparathyroidism in the three study groups.;Analysis of data showed no significant differences in the rate of transient (Group A: 3.6%, Group B: 3.9%, and Group C: 5.5%; p=0.404) and permanent (Group A: 1%, Group B: 0.5%, and Group C: 2.3%; p=0.099) RLN injury between the three study groups. Both ipsilateral CND and bilateral CND were associated with a higher rate of transient hypoparathyroidism (Group: A 27.7%, Group B: 36.1%, and Group C: 51.9%; p=0.014; odds ratio [OR]: 1.477; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.091-2.001; p<0.001; OR: 2.827; 95% CI: 2.065-3.870, respectively). Bilateral CND had a higher rate of permanent hypoparathyroidism (Group A: 6.3%, Group B: 7%, and Group C: 16.2%; p<0.001; OR: 2.860; 95% CI: 1.725-4.743).;The increased rates of transient and permanent hypoparathyroidism in our series suggest a critical review of indications for the routine use of prophylactic CND for PTC. Prophylactic CND ipsilateral to the tumor associated with total thyroidectomy may represent an effective strategy for reducing the rate of permanent hypoparathyroidism. Concomitant completion contralateral paratracheal lymph node neck dissection should be performed in presence of lymph node metastasis on intraoperative frozen-section pathology. This approach limits the use of bilateral CND to patients with intraoperative pathological findings of lymph node metastases.",

Despite occult central lymph node metastases being common, it is unclear if removing these metastases initially would reduce future locoregional recurrence (LRR). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at comparing the short-term LRR between patients who underwent TT with pCND and those who underwent TT alone.;A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify studies comparing LRR between patients with PTC who underwent TT + pCND (group A) and those who underwent TT alone (group B). Inclusion criteria were cN0 patients, with each comparative group containing > 10 patients, and with the number of LRR and mean follow-up duration available. The pooled incidence rate ratio (IRR) was used for calculating the LRR rate between the two groups. Other parameters evaluated included postoperative radioiodine (RAI) ablation, surgically related complications, and overall morbidity. Meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effects model.;Fourteen studies matched the selection criteria. Of the 3331 patients, 1592 (47.8%) belonged to group A, while 1739 (52.2%) belonged to group B. Relative to group B, group A was significantly more likely to have postoperative RAI ablation (71.7% vs. 53.1%; odds ratio [OR] = 2.60 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.12-3.18]), temporary hypocalcemia (26.0% vs. 10.8%; OR = 2.56 [CI = 2.04-3.21]), and overall morbidity (33.2% vs. 17.7%; OR = 2.12 [CI = 1.75-2.57]). When temporary hypocalcemia was excluded, overall morbidity was similar between the two groups (7.3% vs. 6.8%; OR = 1.07 [CI = 0.78-1.47]). Group A had a significantly lower risk of LRR than group B (4.7% vs. 8.6%; IRR = 0.65 [CI = 0.48-0.86]).;Group A was more likely to have postoperative RAI ablation, temporary hypocalcemia, and overall morbidity than group B. Temporary hypocalcemia was the major surgical morbidity in pCND and, when excluded, the overall morbidity appeared similar between the two groups. Although our meta-analysis would suggest that those who undergo TT + pCND may have a 35% reduction in risk of LRR than those who undergo TT alone in the short term (< 5 years), it remains unclear how much of this risk reduction is related to increased use of RAI ablation and potential selection bias in some of the studies examined.",

Initial therapy was tumor resection for 5 patients, lobectomy for 23 patients, total thyroidectomy with unilateral modified neck dissection for 60 patients, and total thyroidectomy with bilateral modified neck dissection for 7 patients. Clinical stage at diagnosis was as follows. Class I included 28 patients with intrathyroidal disease, class II included 60 patients with positive cervical lymph nodes, and class II included 7 patients with tumor invasion into tissue outside of the thyroid gland. Recurrence of the tumor was evaluated according to lymphocytic infiltration in the thyroid gland. Group A consisted of 36 patients with PTC associated with lymphocytic infiltration, 26 with infiltration surrounding the tumor, 3 with infiltration inside of the tumor, and 7 with both. Group B consisted of the remaining 59 patients with PTC with no lymphocytic infiltration. There were no differences in age, sex, initial tumor size, or initial treatment between groups A and B. Antithyroglobulin antibody and/or antimicrosomal antibody were positive in 16 patients from group A and 4 patients from group B (P < 0.001). Class I included 14 patients from each group, class II included 22 patients from group A and 38 patients from group B, and class III included 7 patients, all from group B. Recurrence of the tumor was found in only 1 group A patient (2.8%), but in 11 patients of group B (18.6%). The percentage of patients free from recurrence over the 10 yr of follow-up in group A was significantly higher than that in group B (by Cox-Mantel test, P < 0.01). The time between initial treatment and recurrence was 2-10 yr. In comparing the clinical stage at the time of initial treatment, recurrence was found in 1 class II patient from group A (4.5%) and in 1 class I (7.1%), 6 class II (15.8%), and 4 class III (57.1%) patients from group B. No patients died during the 10 yr of follow-up. In conclusion, 1) lymphocytic infiltration surrounding the tumor or inside the tumor in PTC might be of use as a means for predicting a favorable prognosis; and 2) class II or class III patients with no lymphocytic infiltration had a high rate of recurrence.",

Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry and immunoblotting.

Treatment of PTC cell lines with thiostrepton, an inhibitor of FoxM1, resulted in inhibition of cell viability via induction of apoptosis. In addition, thiostrepton treatment of PTC cells or expression of FoxM1-specific small interfering RNA down-regulated expression of FoxM1 accompanied with decreased MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. Furthermore, inhibition of FoxM1 attenuated migration and invasion of PTC cells. Interestingly, overexpression of FoxM1 rescued the effects of thiostrepton in PTC cell lines. Finally, treatment of PTC cell line xenografts with thiostrepton resulted in growth inhibition of tumors in nude mice via down-regulation of FoxM1 and MMP-9 and MMP-2.;Altogether, this is the first study showing that FoxM1 and its associated signaling pathway play a critical role in the pathogenesis of PTC and may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention for treatment of these cancers.",

The benign sclerosing lesions of the thyroid include Riedel's disease and fibrosing Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Although these conditions usually occur separately, rarely can they occur simultaneously. In malignant lesions, papillary thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid can be associated with extensive sclerosis leading to partial or total effacement of the tumor. We report on three cases that showed simultaneous occurrence of Riedel's disease and fibrosing Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Two of these cases also showed papillary carcinoma (one case of Warthin's-like papillary carcinoma and one case of classic type). All patients were females (age range 32-67 yr) and presented with elevated antithyroglobulin antibodies. Two patients presented with a solitary thyroid mass, and from these one had multiple bilateral neck nodes and a paravertebral mass. The third patient presented with a multinodular gland adherent to neck structures. All patients underwent total thyroidectomy. Histologic sections showed extensive replacement of the thyroid parenchyma with dense keloidal fibrosis, intermixed well-developed lymphoid follicles, and scattered lymphocytes and plasma cells. In all cases the fibrotic process extended beyond thyroid capsule with involvement of the perithyroidal soft tissues and skeletal muscle consistent with Riedel's disease. One case showed a classic papillary carcinoma with bilateral lymph node metastases, and the other showed a Warthin's-like papillary carcinoma. In both cases the papillary cancers were surrounded by dense sclerosis. Immunohistochemical stains for B- and T-markers and immunoglobulin light chains showed a polyclonal population of the lymphoid cells. The simultaneous occurrence of Riedel's disease and fibrosing Hashimoto's thyroiditis is rare and most likely represents a coincidental phenomenon, because both of these conditions are distinct clinicopathologic entities.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate the problem of whether or not the changes of AAIRs of individual tumors in time and space show a similar fitness to the equilibrium model of the law of mass action. The cancer risk data set of: a) 20 neoplasias in scope; b) 6 cancer registration areas in space; and c) 5 sequential investigations from early 1960's to mid 1980's in time, were subjected to the sequential regression analysis - a modification of the least square method. Results obtained are as follows: a) out of 20 tumors tested, all tumors other than 5 tumor types showed a good fitness (P<0.05) to the equilibrium model of the law of mass action in their risk changes in space. The 5 tumor types that failed to fit to the equilibrium model were male gall-bladder cancer, male breast cancer, male thyroid cancer, female liver cancer and female laryngeal cancer. They were all classified as the members of low-risk gender in the cancer family with sex discrimination of cancer risk. b) All tumors other than male thyroid cancer of Birmingham-England showed a good fitness to the equilibrium model of the law of mass action in their risk changes in time. c) It is argued that the good fitness to the equilibrium model of the law of mass action and the poor fitness to the equilibrium model can be taken each as indication of the predominant expression of oncogene activation and the emergence of intervention of tumor suppressor gene inactivation to the full expression of oncogene activation in the mathematical structure of the cancer risk data set. The significance of the above findings as the supporting evidence of the steroid criminal hypothesis of carcinogenesis as well as the pertinence of the least square method to the mathematical analysis of cancer risk are discussed in the light of historical development of science from early 19th century to late 20th century.",

We studied four patients with thyroid nodules, three of whom underwent surgical neck exploration, after an erroneous diagnosis of MTC because of falsely high serum CT eventually proved to be due to HA. One patient had a lingual thyroid, two autoimmune thyroiditis and the fourth a colloid goiter. The minimal incremental CT response to calcium infusion raised our suspicion of possible false high CT values due to HA. There was no linearity of the CT values obtained by testing serial dilutions of the sera in the CT assay, which employs two monoclonal mouse anti-CT antibodies. Addition of normal mouse gamma globulin eliminated the interference by HA in the sera of two patients. Serum assayed in a polyclonal radioimmunoassay using goat anti-CT antibodies gave normal CT values. Finally, incubation of the sera in Heterophilic Blocking Tubes (HBT) eliminated the false CT immunoreactivity. A spontaneous change of the CT serum concentrations was noticed in three patients over several months, apparently due to changing titles of HA. We suggest that, in patients a) whose CT response to calcium or pentagastrin infusion is minimal despite high basal CT values, b) with autoimmune thyroiditis and c) in whom an unexpected change in serum CT concentrations occurs, the possibility of spuriously high CT values because of circulating HA should be considered.",

Cathepsin B inhibitors have also been considered as anticancer drug candidates; hence, there has been a growing need for a probe which enables the selective and simple detection of cathepsin B and its inhibitors. For the purpose of selective assay, a cathepsin B-specific substrate, N,N'-diBoc-dityrosine-glycine-phenylalanine-3-(methylthio)propylamine (DBDY-Gly-Phe-MTPA) was synthesized in this study. Phe-MTPA, which was produced via cathepsin B-catalyzed hydrolysis of DBDY-Gly-Phe-MTPA, allowed aggregation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) leading to a color change from red to blue. When tested for cathepsins B, L, and S, this assay method exhibited AuNPs color change only in reaction to cathepsin B. The limits of detection for cathepsin B was 10 and 5 nM in the 1 and 2 h hydrolysis reactions, respectively. The efficiency of cathepsin B inhibitors such as leupeptin, antipain, and chymostatin was easily compared by the degree of color change. Moreover, IC50 values of leupeptin, antipain, and chymostatin were found to be 0.11, 0.48, and 1.78 μM, respectively, which were similar to the results of previous studies. Therefore the colorimetric assay of cathepsin B and cathepsin B inhibitors using DBDY-Gly-Phe-MTPA and AuNPs allowed not only the selective but also the simple assay of cathepsin B and its inhibitors, which was possible with the naked eye.

We also compare the results of four evaluators to determine the inter-observer variability and the variance between term sets, with respect to the accuracy of the mappings and the reliability of the failure analysis.;From a corpus of approximately 1,000,000 unique terms entered into the Impression/Report/Plan section of the clinical notes system in the calendar year 1997, we randomly selected 1,000 terms. We then further randomized these 1,000 terms into two groups of 500 (Sets A and B). We constructed two copies of the same term matching interface, one without ATC (alpha) and one with ATC (beta). We took four expert Indexers and assigned them to one of the following tasks. The first reviewer (R1) compared set A using the alpha program and then set B using the beta program (R1(Aalpha + Bbeta)). The second compared set A using the alpha program and then set B using the alpha program (R2(A + B) alpha). The third compared set B using the beta program and then set A using the beta program (R3(B + A) beta). The fourth compared set A using the beta program and then set B using the alpha program (R4(Abeta + Balpha)).;The program with Automated Term Composition mapped 540 out of the 1,000 Concepts correctly (54.0%). The same program without ATC mapped only 276 out of the 1,000 Concepts correctly (27.6%). Therefore the program with ATC was significantly more effective at matching concepts in our problem lists than the same search engine without ATC (p < 0.0001; McNemar Method). These figures result from the comparison of the alpha program with the beta program by reviewers one and four. Failure analysis showed that with the alpha version 425 out of the 724 mismatches were because a base concept was missing from the retrieval set (58.7%) and 299 mismatches were from missing qualifiers or modifiers or both (41.3%). In the beta version of the program (with ATC) 340 out of the 460 mismatches were secondary to there being a missing base concept in the retrieval set (73.9%) and only 120 mismatches due to missing modifiers and or qualifiers (26.1%).;Automated term composition provided significantly better coverage of a randomly chosen set of patient problems, diagnosed at the Mayo Clinic during the 1997 calendar year, when compared with the same information retrieval system without ATC. We believe that these results speak further to the excellent content coverage provided by the UMLS metathesaurus. These authors believe that increased structure, normalization of UMLS content and semantics, and better tools to make use of the currently available content such as automated term composition, are what is needed to leverage the production of commercially viable tools that provide access to controlled vocabularies for medicine.",

Of all the patients who presented with a benign STN, malignancy was found more frequently in 'cold' nodules (13.5 per cent), than in nodules with a different presentation on scintiscanning (0-9.5 per cent). Cancers occurred in 5 per cent of the females and in 19.5 per cent of the males. Group B included patients with overt signs of malignancy.

        "Doc_abstract":"Many evolutionary scenarios describing the history of proteins are based solely on phylogenetic studies. We have designed a new approach that allows ascertainment of such questionable scenarios by taking into account quaternary structures: we used aspartate carbamoyltransferase (ATCase) as a case study. Prokaryotic ATCases correspond to different classes of quaternary structures according to the mode of association of the catalytic PyrB subunit with other polypeptides, either the PyrI regulatory subunit (class B) or a dihydroorotase (class A), which may be active (PyrC, subclass A1) or inactive (PyrC', subclass A2). Class C is uniquely made up of trimers of PyrB. The PyrB phylogenetic tree is not congruent with the tree of life, but it became coherent when we recognized the existence of two families of ATCases, ATC I and ATC II. Remarkably, a very strong correlation was found between the pattern of PyrB phylogenetic clustering and the different classes of quaternary structures of ATCases. All class B ATCases form a clade in family ATC II, which also contains all eukaryotic sequences. In contrast, family ATC I is made up of classes A and C. These results suggest unexpected common ancestry for prokaryotic B and eukaryotic ATCases on the one hand, and for A and C on the other. Thus, the emergence of specific quaternary structures appears to have been a more recent event than the separation into the ATC I and ATC II families. We propose that different evolutionary constraints, depending on the identity of the partners interacting in the different kinds of holoenzymes, operated in a concerted way on the ancestral pyrB genes and the respective associated genes pyrI or pyrC, so as to maintain appropriate inter-polypeptides interactions at the level of quaternary structure. The process of coevolution of genes encoding proteins interacting in various holoenzymes has been assessed by calculating the correlation coefficient between their respective phylogenetic trees. Our approach integrating data obtained from the separate fields of structural biology and molecular evolution could be useful in other cases where pure statistical data need to receive independent confirmation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"We have presented evidence that the functional thyroid follicles (follicular units, FU) which are formed in grafts of monodispersed rat thyroid cells, and hence the thyroid tumors which later develop in such grafts, are clonal in origin. Transplantation assays indicate that the clonogens comprise approximately 1% of the cells in monodispersed suspensions of normal thyroid tissue. Carcinogenesis studies show that neoplastic initiation of thyroid clonogens by radiation is a common event. Promotion-progression to cancer from radiation initiated clonogens has, however, been shown to be inversely related to the total grafted thyroid cell number; i.e. more tumors develop per irradiated clonogen in grafts of small cell numbers than of large cell numbers. Recent studies have been designed to investigate: a) whether the cell number-dependent inhibition of promotion-progression is mediated by remote hormonal feed-back, local cell-cell interactions, or both; b) the cell population kinetics of the clonogen subpopulation during goitrogenesis and goiter involution; and c) the effect of prolonged exposure to high levels of TSH (thyrotropin) on the capacity of the clonogens to give rise to functional FU. The results indicate that local cell-cell interactions play an important role in the cell number-dependent suppression of neoplastic promotion-progression. They also show that if sufficient thyroid cells are grafted, the thyroid-pituitary axis can be reestablished in thyroidectomized rats fed normal diets. In such animals given iodine deficient diets, the FU that develop in the thyroid grafts shift their secretory pattern to increase the ratio of T3 (triiodothyronine) to T4 (thyroxine), and thus conserve the available iodine. Finally, the clonogenic subpopulation is conserved during both goitrogenesis and goiter involution. When they are transplanted to thyroidectomized recipients, clonogens from two types of goiters form FU that are morphologically indistinguishable from those that develop in grafts of normal thyroid clonogens. Furthermore, the secretion of T3 and T4 by such grafts is dependent on the grafted clonogen number, and hence FU formation, and not on the total number of thyroid cells transplanted. We conclude that the thyroid clonogens, the presumptive cancer progenitor cells, have many of the characteristics of stem cells.",

Parents completed a medication log, and recorded the presence and severity of opioid-related adverse effects and children's reports of pain intensity using a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale.;No differences were found in analgesic administration or pain intensity scores between the 2 ATC groups. Therefore, they were combined for comparison with the PRN group. Children in the ATC group received more analgesic than those in the PRN group (P<0.0001). Children in the PRN group had higher pain intensity scores compared to children in the ATC group, both at rest (P=0.017) and with swallowing (P=0.017). Pain intensity scores for both groups were higher in the morning compared with the evening (P<0.0001). With the exception of constipation, scheduled analgesic dosing did not increase the frequency or severity of opioid-related adverse effects.;Scheduled dosing of acetaminophen and hydrocodone is more effective than PRN dosing in reducing pain intensity in children after tonsillectomy.

In the pivotal phase III DECISION trial in patients with RAI-refractory, locally advanced or metastatic DTC, oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily significantly prolonged median progression-free survival (PFS) relative to placebo. The PFS benefit of sorafenib over placebo was evident in all pre-specified clinical and genetic biomarker subgroups, and neither BRAF nor RAS mutation status was predictive of sorafenib benefit for PFS. The objective response rate was significantly higher in patients receiving sorafenib than in those receiving placebo; all objective responses were partial responses. The overall survival benefit of sorafenib is as yet unclear, with no significant benefit observed at the time of primary analysis or at 9 months following the primary analysis. Overall survival was possibly confounded by the crossover of patients in the placebo group to sorafenib upon disease progression. The adverse events associated with sorafenib in the DECISION trial were consistent with the known tolerability profile of the drug, with hand-foot skin reaction, diarrhea, and alopecia reported most commonly. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were grade 1 or 2 in severity and occurred early in treatment. However, a high proportion of patients discontinued sorafenib therapy or required dose reductions or interruptions because of toxicity. Although final overall survival data are awaited, current evidence suggests that sorafenib is a promising new treatment option for patients with RAI-refractory, metastatic DTC. ",

Sporadic pediatric DTCs with informative molecular testing (n=18) were studied. We previously tested 15 cases by our standard 7-gene (BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, RET/PTC1, RET/PTC3, PAX8/PPARg) mutation panel. Three cases were not tested previously. The standard 7-gene panel identified molecular alterations in 9 of 15 tumors (60%). Cases analyzed by ThyroSeq v2 NGS included the six previously negative cases by the standard 7-gene panel and three cases not previously tested. The NGS assay revealed new gene fusions in four of six previously negative cases (67%). These gene fusions included ETV6/NTRK3 (n=3) and TPR/NTRK1 (n=1). A point mutation (BRAF-V600E) was detected in one of three untested cases. While standard testing could identify only molecular alterations in 60% of cases, with the addition of the ThyroSeq v2 NGS, this increased to 87% (n=13/15). Some cases with chromosomal rearrangements, including ETV6/NTRK3, appear to be associated with an aggressive histopathologic phenotype, but had no documented history of radiation exposure. Additional work is needed to investigate if pediatric DTCs could benefit from a reclassification based on molecular subtypes, which may better reflect their underlying biologic potential. Our data support the use of broad gene panels for the molecular diagnostics of pediatric thyroid nodules to aid future classification, treatment, and clinical management recommendations.",

After each 111In-Octreotide scintigraphy the target/background (T/B) radioactivity ratio was calculated for each detectable metastases. A total of 14/18 metastases showed a reduction in the T/B ratio after therapy, suggesting saturation or down-regulation of the somatostatin receptors on metastases induced by octreotide therapy.

This diversity of classifications impairs the exchange of drug information, while the use of international or European classifications facilitates this diffusion. The \"Hospital National Center of Drugs Information\" (CNHIM) has integrated ATC (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical) and EphMRA (European Pharmaceutical Marketing Research Association) classifications into its \"Thériaque\" database and has given the ATC official status in France by publishing a French translation. The objective of this article was to analyse the evolution of these two classification systems between 1996 and 2003, and to compare their allocations (of codes) with those for the drugs present in Thériaque in January 2002. The ATC comprises 14 principal groups and five levels of hierarchy, while the EphMRA comprises 16 principal groups and three to four levels. In Thériaque, the ATC is linked to active substances and drugs, and the EphMRA to drugs. Data-processing requests have made it possible to make a comparative analysis. Each year, the two classification systems evolve in terms of addition, suppression, modification and subdivision. Two principal differences are evident in the allocations in Thériaque (class EphMRA K \"Hospital solutions\" versus class ATC B \"Blood and blood forming organ\"; class EphMRA T \"Diagnostic agents\" versus class ATC V \"Various\"). Classifications evolve in parallel or independently, and although they are closely related to one another, they retain their specificities in terms of structure and uses.",

For this analysis, we treated the cells by ultrasound, which freed up some of the proteins into the supernatant but left some attached to the cell fragments. Both types of proteins were further separated by free-flow IEF and SDS gel electrophoresis until their identity was determined by MS. The MS data revealed differences between the two cell lines with regard to various structural proteins such as vimentin, tubulins and actin. Interestingly, integrin α-5 chains, myosin-10 and filamin B were only found in FTC-133 cells, while collagen was only detected in CGTH W-1 cells. These analyses suggest that FTC-133 cells express surface proteins that bind fibronectin, strengthening the three-dimensional cell cohesion.",

M. radiodurans was much more resistant than E. coli B/r to the lethal effects of UV light (by a factor of 33), gamma-radiation (55), NG (15) and NA (62), showed intermediate resistance to MTC (4) and HA (7), but was sensitive to EMS (1) and betaPL (2). M. radiodurans was very resistant to mutagens producing damage which can be repaired by a recombination system, indicating that it possesses an extremely efficient recombination repair mechanism. Both species were equally sensitive to mutation to trimethoprim resistance by NG, but M. radiodurans was more resistant than E. coli B/R to the other mutagens tests, being non-mutable by UV light, gamma-radiation, MTC and HA, and only slightly sensitive to mutation by NA, EMS and betaPL. The resistance of M. radiodurans to mutation by UV-light, gamma-radiation and MTC is consistent with an hypothesis that recombination repair in M. radiodurans is accurate since these mutagens may depend on an \"error-prone\" recombination system for their mutagenic effect in E. coli B/r. However, because M. radiodurans is also resistant to mutagens such as HA and EMS, which are mutagenic in E. coli in the absence of an \"error-prone\" system, we propose that all the mutagens tested may have a common mode of action in E. coli B/r, but that this mutagenic pathway is missing in M. radiodurans.",

In this study, we show that IFN-alpha itself induces IL-16 secretion by peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and enhances IL-16 secretion by anti-CD3 stimulated PBL. Pro-IL-16 is cleaved into its active form by caspase-3. IFN-alpha increases caspase-3 mRNA levels in activated T cells (ATC), as shown by Northern blot analysis, whereas IL-16 mRNA levels are not affected by IFN-alpha. IL-16 secretion into culture supernatants correlates tightly with intracellular caspase-3 activity in ATC. In our experiments addition of specific caspase inhibitors did not reduce the proportion of ATC undergoing Fas-mediated cell death, but completely blocked IFN-alpha-induced IL-16 secretion into culture supernatants.

For each group, we calculated the ratio of I-131 WBS hepatic uptake (H) to cranial uptake as background (B); this ratio was defined as H/B. Furthermore, we made a distinction between group 1, as having completed radioactive iodine therapy (RIT) (CR), and group 2 and 3, as requiring subsequent RIT (RR). The average H/B scores were 1.34 (median, 1.36; range 1.00-2.1) for group 1; 1.89 (median, 1.75; range 1.41-4.20) for group 2; and 2.09 (median, 1.90; range 1.50-4.32) for group 3. Bonferroni multiple comparisons revealed significant differences in H/B among these groups. The H/B of group 1 was significantly smaller than that of other 2 groups (P < 0.0001). The precise cutoff value of H/B for therapeutic effect was ≤1.5. Moreover, 159 of 160 scans in the CR and 375 of 381 patients in the RR were correctly diagnosed using this cutoff value in the final outcome of RIT, yielding a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 99.4%, 98.4%, 99.7%, and 96.3%, respectively.

The sex ratio was 29 women for 8 men with an average age of 59.5. The prevalent histology has a vesicular type (19 cases which represents 51 per cent). The metastasis are mostly found at the dorsal level (48.6).;The different parameters analysed for this study of 37 patients were: invaded segment of the vertebra (anterior, middle, posterior or total), Tokuhashi score, epiduritis extent, patient age, histological type and iodiosensibility.;Out of 37 patients, 3 were lost for follow-up, 7 metastasis were treated carcinologically (\"en bloc\" resection). 30 were treated palliatively depending on the clinical symptoms: neurological, mechanical, or pain. The osseous metastasis exists in 56 per cent of the cases at the time the primitive neoplasy was discovered, and their presence burdens the final prognostic. 21 patients died with an average survival of 21 months, 13 patients survived with a mean follow-up of 50 months, 50 per cent of the patients had a vertebra totally involved with only 13 patients with neurological signs (4 Frankel A, 3 Frankel B, 4 Frankel C and 2 Frankel D).;The analysis of the results shows that the pejorative criteria in case of vertebral metastasis of thyroidal cancer are the score of Tokuhashi inferior to 7, the whole affected vertebra, the epiduritis on 3 levels, the age of the patient superior to 65 and the idiosensibility of the metastase. The surgery do called carcinological gives very good results with 5 surviving patients out of 7.;When reading this study it seems that, in front of vertebral metastasis from thyroidal origin, we should choose the most radical therapeutic attitude as much as possible. This strategy finds its justification by the fact that the thyroidal cancer spreads out slowly giving a survivorship superior to 12 months in case of metastatic vertebral affection. The importance of the tumoral reduction is connected with the efficiency of the iodiotherapy (for differentiated histological types). This is a considerable adjuvant treatment for this kind of cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies have been used to identify sites harbouring tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) involved in tumour initiation or progression. To further elucidate the genetic mechanisms for follicular and papillary thyroid tumours development, we studied the frequency of LOH in 36 thyroid tumours (21 follicular thyroid adenomas (FAs) and 15 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs)) on 10 specific genomic areas: 3p22, 3p25, 7q21, 7q31, 10q23, 10q25-26, 11q13, 11q23, 13q13 and 17p13.3-13.2 using 20 polymorphic markers. We have selected these areas for two reasons: (a) Even though LOH in thyroid neoplasms has been described in some of these areas, results are controversial, and (b) we have also studied areas described as involved in other epithelial or endocrine tumour types, but not studied up to now in thyroid neoplasms. Two areas showed a high percentage of LOH: 7q31 and 11q23. A 62% LOH was found at 7q31 in the FAs, suggesting, as other authors have proposed, that at least one TSG must be present in the vicinity of the c-met locus. The second area in frequency was at the 11q23 locus, with a 45% LOH in the FAs. This area was studied because it has been described as being involved in the development of epithelial and endocrine cancers. This locus had not been studied before in thyroid neoplasms. This result is interesting because the LOH11CR2A gene is localised at this locus. We suggest that this gene and/or an other TSG nearby may be involved in the progression to FA. In our study, a low percentage of LOH was found in the PTC samples, indicating that TSGs present in the areas we have studied are not significantly involved in their progression. Our data also suggest that TSGs located in areas where no LOH was detected (PTEN, MEN1, Cyclin D1, BRCA2 and RFC3) are not involved or do not have an important role in tumour progression.",

The staining reaction in each case was graded on the basis of percentage of epithelial cells stained (1+, <10%; 2+, <10%-50%; 3+, >50). Tissue follow-up was available in all cases.;Nineteen (95%) of 20 cases with an unequivocal diagnosis of papillary carcinoma were positive for CK-19 (3+). Tissue follow-up confirmed papillary carcinoma in all 20 cases. Of the 19 cases with a diagnosis of atypical cytology, cannot exclude papillary carcinoma, 7 (37%) cases displayed 3+ immunostaining and subsequent excision confirmed papillary carcinoma in all 7 cases. The remaining 12 cases with 1+ immunostaining included surgically confirmed goiter (6 cases), adenoma (2 cases), lymphocytic thyroiditis (3 cases), and papillary carcinoma (1 case). The follicular cells in 18 cases with a cytologic diagnosis of nonneoplastic thyroid showed 1+ immunostaining.

Galectin-3 (Gal-3) and the oncogene BRAFV600E are markers of malignancy useful to improve FNAB accuracy. The objective of this study was to determine whether the combined analysis of Gal-3 and BRAFV600E expression in thyroid aspirates could improve the diagnosis in FNAB with suspicious cytological findings. Two hundred and sixty-one surgical thyroid tissues and one hundred and forty-four thyroid aspirates were analyzed for the presence of the two markers. In surgical specimens, Gal-3 expression was present in 27.4% benign nodules, 91.9% papillary (PTC) and 75% follicular (FTC) thyroid carcinomas. BRAFV600E was not detected in 127 benign nodules, as well as in 32 FTCs, while was found in 42.9% PTC. No correlation was found between BRAF mutation and Gal-3 expression. Forty-seven consecutive FNAB suspicious for PTC were analyzed for the presence of the two markers. Of these nodules, 23 were benign at histology, 6 were positive for Gal-3, none displayed BRAFV600E, and 17 were negative for both the markers. Twenty suspicious nodules were diagnosed as PTC and four FTCs at histology. Of these 24 carcinomas, 9 resulted positive for BRAFV600E, 17 for Gal-3, and 22 for one or both the markers. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the presence of Gal-3 and/or BRAFV600E were significantly higher than those obtained for the two markers alone. Notably, the negative predictive value increased from 70.8 to 89.5%. In conclusion, the combined detection of Gal-3 and BRAFV600E improves the diagnosis in FNAB with cytological findings suspicious for PTC and finds clinical application in selected cases.",

In the present study a panel of MoABs against different type 1 chain derived blood group antigens, comprising A, B, H type 1, Le(a), sialyl-Le(a) (CA 19-9), sialyl type 1 structure (CA 50), and Le(b) was used to investigate their immunoreactivity in 38 medullary carcinomas of the thyroid (MTC) and in normal thyroid tissue. The antigens were not expressed in normal follicular or C-cells but were expressed to a various extent in MTC. The studies revealed some characteristic anomalies in the frequency and patterns of tumor-associated antigen expression. The MoAB C 50 stained 32 of the 38 tumors, H type 1 (Le(d)) was demonstrated in 21 and the Le(b) antigen in 27. The Le(a)- and the A antigen were detected in 10 and 12 tumors and the B antigen in one. From the results some rules about the pathways for tumor-associated re-expression of these antigens can be deduced. Le(a) antigen expression was significantly correlated with the CA 50 and Le(b) antigens. The significant relation observed between A-, H1-, and Le(b) antigen formation in MTC suggests the existence of a carcinoma-associated fucosyltransferase committing the type 1 precursor chain along the H1-antigen pathway, and by further glycosylation to an A-, B-, or a Le(b) antigen. Comparative studies of tumor-associated H type 1 and H type 2 antigen expression revealed that H type 2 antigen synthesis was significantly related to a blood type 0 in the host. On the other hand, H1 antigen reactivity was independent of the AB0 blood type of the hosts and was also detected in H type 2 antigen-negative tumors. These findings support the proposal that even in tumor tissue, H antigen expression is still determined by the interaction of at least two different genes. Despite the occurrence of the precursor substance (CA 50) and the formation of the Le(a)- and Le(b) antigens, indicating the presence of a alpha 1,4-fucosyl-transferase (Lewis-enzyme), only two tumors showed the formation of CA 19-9. In conclusion, the investigations demonstrated the dominant re-expression of three type 1 chain-derived structures in MTC, namely H type 1, Le(b), and CA 50. These findings support the general concept demonstrated in other carcinomas, that fucosyl- and sialyltransferases are preferentially activated in MTC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The presence of intranodular blood flow and the absence of a cystic component were associated with a greater possibility of positive FDG uptake. Multivariate analysis showed that vascularity was the only independent factor predicting FDG uptake.

The purpose of the study was to compare the results collected from athletes with those collected previously from ATCs. The questionnaire consisted of 60 statements, categorized into seven scales: athletic trainers' influence, environmental influences, athlete's personality, pain tolerance, self-motivation, goals and incentives, and significant others. Four additional open-ended questions dealing with successful and unsuccessful rehabilitation strategies also were completed. Athletes' responses were generally similar to those of ATCs. Factors deemed significant to rehabilitation adherence were: (a) good rapport and communication between athletic trainers and injured athletes, (b) support from athletic trainers and coaches, (c) self-motivation on the part of athletes, and (d) convenience, accessibility, and flexibility of the rehabilitation facility and staff. The greatest deviations between athletes' and ATCs' responses were in the areas of self-motivation, pain tolerance, education about injury and rehabilitation exercises, and degree of realistic feedback. Analyses of open-ended question responses reinforced the aforementioned results. The strongest findings derived from these questions were the importance of rapport, communication, and support to rehabilitation adherence. Also, athletes' distastes for threats and scare tactics were quite evident.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of detecting bcl1/JH by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) compared with Southern blot analysis in cases proven by cytogenetic analysis to harbor t(11;14). Southern blot analysis using two probes targeting the major translocation cluster (MTC) and a third probe targeting the p94 region was performed, along with PCR using two different bcl1 MTC primers, on 18 cases of MCL known to have t(11;14). Southern blot analysis revealed bcl1 rearrangement in 13 of 18 cases (72%), 12 with MTC breakpoints and 1 with a p94 breakpoint. The 2.1-kb MTC probe \"b\" was superior to the smaller 700-bp probe \"a\" in detecting these rearrangements. The MTC translocation was identified by PCR in 10 of 12 cases, and both primer sets that were tested performed equally well. This study illustrates the frequency with which molecular methods detect known t(11;14) translocations in MCLs.

Apart from biochemical analysis of serum calcium, phosphate, and intact parathyroid hormone, double-phase scintigraphy was performed in each patient 5 and 45 minutes after injection of 370 MBq 99mTc tetrofosmin, followed by SPECT imaging. In consciousness of the scintigraphic results, ultrasound of the neck was performed as well to exclude false-positive results due to thyroid adenomas.;Depending on the results of the biochemical analysis in combination with the results of the scintigraphic and ultrasound examination, the patients were classified retrospectively into three groups: group A with primary HPT (n = 35), group B with secondary HPT (n = 13), and group C without any biochemical suspicion of primary or secondary HPT (n = 20). In group A, double-phase study localized 25 of 36 (69.2%) parathyroid adenomas (one double adenoma) as against 34 of 36 (94.4%) with SPECT. Nine adenomas could be visualized only by SPECT. The reason for nonvisualization on planar scans was suspected to be an ectopic location in 2 cases (retrotracheal dislocation, retrovascular dislocation), a maximal diameter less than 15 mm (9-13 mm) in 6 cases, and oxyphilic-cell-poor cellularity in 1 case. Four false-positive retention (3 thyroid adenomas and 1 papillary thyroid carcinoma) were observed. SPECT showed a sensitivity of 94.4%, a specificity of 85%, and a PPV of 91.9% in biochemically suspected primary HPT. In group B, planar scintigraphy demonstrated 12 hyperplastic glands in 5 of 13 patients, and SPECT demonstrated 20 hyperplastic parathyroid glands in 8 out of 13 patients, which corresponds to a sensitivity of 38% and 61.5%, respectively.;Technetium 99m tetrofosmin seems to be a promising alternative tracer with similar capabilities to 99mTc sestamibi in localization of parathyroid adenoma. SPECT showed clear advantages in terms of sensitivity over planar scintigraphy and should be used at least in cases with poor or no uptake in double-phase study. In endemic goiter areas, ultrasound of the neck should be performed to exclude false positive retention in thyroid adenomas.

It was shown that in addition to apoptotic cell death, Ptx induces signaling cascades that ensure cell survival. Paclitaxel-induced activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) leads to an increase of some antiapoptotic proteins expression such as survivin, cIAP, XIAP. A novel NF-κB inhibitor, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), was found to enhance cytotoxic effect of Ptx in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells. An enhancement of caspase-3 and -9 activation and PARP cleavage as well as the decreased levels of proteins-inhibitors of apoptosis were observed when cells were treated with a combination of both drugs. Mitochondria transmembrane potential (Δψ (m)) loss was observed at higher concentrations of Ptx and DHMEQ. NF-κB inhibition also potentiates paclitaxel effect at tumors formed by xenotransplantation of FRO cells into mice. Tumor mass reduction, significantly different from the effects of each of the compounds alone, was observed in animals, treated with paclitaxel and NF-κB inhibitor. Thus, the combined use of paclitaxel and NF-κB inhibitor inhibits biochemical processes that contribute to the resistance of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells to paclitaxel action.",

In this work we investigated the synthesis and secretion of growth factors and the expression of their corresponding receptors in HTC-TSHr thyroid carcinoma cells. These cells synthesize epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors and platelet-derived growth factor beta (PDGF beta) receptors and in addition transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha), PDGF-A and PDGF-B chains, respectively. Addition of EGF or PDGF-BB to the culture medium resulted in growth inhibition of HTC-TSHr cells. In contrast, treatment of the cells with low concentrations of neutralizing anti-TGF alpha antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors led to stimulation of cell proliferation. Low concentrations of neutralizing anti-PDGF-B antibodies did not affect growth of the cells. As expected, cell proliferation was inhibited when high concentrations of either neutralizing anti-TGF alpha antibodies or anti-PDGF-B antibodies were applied. PDGF-AA did not influence growth of HTC-TSHr cells. We conclude that growth of HTC-TSHr thyroid carcinoma cells is influenced by two autocrine loops between TGF alpha and EGF receptors and between PDGF-B and PDGF beta receptors.

The molecular mechanism underlying INPP4B's tumor-suppressive role is currently unknown. Here, we demonstrate that INPP4B restrains tumor development by dephosphorylating the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 that accumulates in situations of PTEN deficiency. In vitro, INPP4B directly dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. In vivo, neither inactivation of Inpp4b (Inpp4b(Δ/Δ)) nor heterozygous deletion of Pten (Pten(+/-)) in mice causes thyroid abnormalities, but a combination of these mutations induces malignant thyroid cancers with lung metastases. At the molecular level, simultaneous deletion of Inpp4b and Pten synergistically increases PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels and activates AKT downstream signaling proteins in thyroid cells. We propose that the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase activity of INPP4B can function as a \"back-up\" mechanism when PTEN is deficient, making INPP4B a potential novel therapeutic target for PTEN-deficient or PIK3CA-activated cancers.;Although INPP4B expression is reduced in several types of human cancers, our work on Inpp4B-deficient mice provides the first evidence that INPP4B is a bona fide tumor suppressor whose function is particularly important in situations of PTEN deficiency.

        "Doc_abstract":"Overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase HER-2/neu is associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast and ovarian cancer. Recent excitement has surrounded the therapeutic effects of HER-2-blocking therapy strategies and has rekindled interest on the molecular mechanisms of HER-2/neu in tumor biology. To study the role of HER-2/neu overexpression in vivo, we used a murine fibroblast cell line (NIH3T3-her2) conditionally expressing human HER-2/neu under control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter. Expression of HER-2 could be down-regulated below detection limit (>625-fold dilution) by exposure of NIH3T3-her2 cells to anhydrotetracycline (ATc). Subcutaneous injection of NIH3T3-her2 cells into nude mice resulted in rapid tumor growth. Mice with mean tumor volumes of 0.2, 0.8, 1.9, and 14.9 cm(3) were treated daily with 10 mg/kg ATc to switch off HER-2/neu expression, producing reductions in tumor size of 100, 98.1, 81.4, and 74.2%, respectively, by 7 days after onset of ATc administration (P = 0.005, Kruskal-Wallis test). Different long-term effects of HER-2 down-regulation were observed when mice with small (0.2 cm(3); n = 7), intermediate (0.8-1.2 cm(3); n = 10) and large (> or =1.9 cm(3); n = 11) tumors received ATc for up to 40 days. Complete remission was observed for 100, 40, and 18% of the small-, intermediate-, and large-sized tumors, respectively (P = 0.003). However, after 20-45 days of ATc administration, recurrent tumor growth was observed for all mice, even in those with previous complete remissions. The time periods for which mean tumor volume could be suppressed to volumes <0.1 cm(3) under ATc administration were 34, 22, 8, and 0 days for tumors with initial volumes of 0.2, 0.8, 1.9 and 14.9 cm(3), respectively (P = 0.005, Kruskal-Wallis test). Interestingly, HER-2 remained below the detection limit in recurrent tumor tissue, suggesting that initially HER-2-dependent tumors switched to HER-2 independence. The \"second hits\" leading to HER-2-independent tumor growth have not yet been identified. The rapid regression of tumors after down-regulation of HER-2 was explained by two independent mechanisms: (a) a block in cell cycle progression, as evidenced by a decrease in Ki-67 antigen expression from 40% before ATc treatment to 8.3% after 7 days of ATc treatment; and (b) induction of apoptosis as demonstrated by caspase-3 activation and by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Tdt)-mediated nick end labeling assay (TUNEL). In conclusion, we have shown that switching off HER-2 may disturb the sensitive balance between cell proliferation and cell death, leading to apoptosis and tumor remission. Tumor remission was dependent on the volume of the tumors before down-regulation of HER-2/neu.",

For the patient's prognosis and the administration of a patient-tailored therapy strategy it is crucial to identify diagnostic and prognostic markers for high-risk DCIS patients. MUC1 is associated with tumour aggressiveness in human breast cancer. Recent studies used MUC1 splice variant A to identify malignant thyroid cancer. In the present study we have examined the usefulness of MUC1 splice variants as prognostic markers in DCIS. We used laser capture microdissection of paraffin-embedded tissue to isolate RNA from isolated tumour cells and determined the MUC1 splice variant distribution by RT-PCR. In the majority of cases variant B was more highly expressed than variant A. This was true for pure DCIS (66%) as well as for DCIS with adjacent invasive cancer (66%). In 7 out of 18 cases (38%) of pure DCIS variant A was not expressed at all. In DCIS with adjacent invasive cancer only 2 samples out of 12 showed this expression pattern (16%). The situation that variant A was more highly expressed than B, or that variant B was not expressed at all, was similar for pure DCIS (27%) and for DCIS with adjacent invasive cancer (33%).

Analizar el porcentaje de intervenciones sobre tratamientos agudos o crónicos, y el grupo ATC de los fármacos implicados. Método: Se analizaron y clasificaron las intervenciones farmacéuticas realizadas durante un año, asignándoles el grado de recomendación, nivel de evidencia y reducción de la morbimortalidad teórica asociada según las guías de práctica clínica. También fueron clasificadas según el objetivo del tratamiento de la intervención (agudo o crónico), y por el grupo ATC. Resultado: Se realizaron 2.776 intervenciones farmacéuticas durante el período de estudio, siendo el 47% intervenciones de inicio de tratamiento. El 73% pudieron ser clasificadas según la evidencia científica disponible en las guías de práctica clínica. El 84% obtuvo un grado de recomendación y nivel de evidencia IA, el 9% IC y 4% IB. El 67% tenían asociada una disminución teórica de la morbimortalidad. El 73% de las intervenciones estuvieron relacionadas con el tratamiento crónico del paciente, siendo los grupos ATC más frecuentes el N y C. Mientras que en los tratamientos agudos los más frecuentes fueron el grupo B y A. Conclusiones: Las intervenciones de inicio de tratamiento realizadas por un farmacéutico clínico en el Servicio de Urgencias muestran una elevada adherencia a las guías de práctica clínica con un alto grado de recomendación y evidencia, y reducción teórica de la morbimortalidad asociada. La mayoría de las intervenciones estuvieron relacionadas con la conciliación de tratamientos crónicos, fundamentalmente fármacos del grupo N y C.",

        "Doc_abstract":"This paper discusses the problem whether burnout is an evidence of a psychological distress subsequently resulting in a clear psychiatric disorder or can be deemed an already well-defined psychiatric syndrome. The aim of this study was: 1) To assess the frequency of psychological distress in two groups of subjects at high risk for burnout; such perceived psychological distress was self-rated as anxiety, depression or impulse dyscontrol by the subjects. 2) To evaluate whether subjects reporting anxiety, depression or impulse dyscontrol showed an higher emotional and mental exhaustion (EME); EME was intended as a marker of burnout. 3) To investigate relationships between self-reported psychoactive drug use or psychosomatic disorders and levels of EME score. 109 air traffic controllers (ATC) and 88 health service professionals (HSP) were given a questionnaire, the Rome burnout inventory (RBI) developed as an easy-to-administer, easy-to-complete self-rating tool to be filled out during breaks in working environments. RBI assessed: a) EME; b) physical exhaustion; c) social support by components of the social network; d) work- and non-work-related stressors; e) self-reported psychosomatic disorders and perceived psychological distress in terms of anxiety, depression, impulse dyscontrol; f) psychoactive drug use. EME was positively related to years in office and was higher in ATC independently from the different seniority between professional groups. By using a factorial ANOVA, subjects with self-reported psychological distress (anxiety, depression, impulse dyscontrol) showed higher levels of the EME score although these levels were not higher in individuals reporting psychoactive drug intake. These findings were the same in both the professional groups. Psychosomatic disorders were significantly more frequent in ATC (chi 2 with Yates' correction); this is likely to be due to an higher overall level of EME score in ATC but ATC and HSP with self-reported psychosomatic disorders did not show higher levels of EME score. There was a different way to refer to perceived psychological distress in the two professional groups. ATC mainly emphasized the role of impulse dyscontrol as a way to express the subjective feelings of an augmenting distress. Otherwise, HSP seemed to stress depression as the proper descriptor of their own psychological distress.",

The translocation occurs within the major translocation cluster (MTC) of BCL6, and as the result of translocation either one of the three immunoglobulin (Ig) genes or a heterogeneous non-Ig gene is juxtaposed to the coding regions of BCL6. On the other hand, somatic hypermutation involves the BCL6 gene of not only B-NHL but also B-cells from normal individuals. The mutations are clustered within a region of the MTC, suggesting that a common molecular mechanism is operating for the two genetic lesions of BCL6. The Bcl-6 protein is a transcriptional repressor that is an important regulator of lymphoid development and function. The protein is preferentially expressed in germinal center (GC) B-cells of normal lymphoid tissues as well as in a variety of B-NHL subtypes derived from GC B-cells irrespective of whether the BCL6 is rearranged. Although there is no consensus on the effect of BCL6 translocation on the clinical outcome of B-NHL, many studies coincide in showing that a high-level of BCL6 expression at either or both the mRNA and protein levels is a favorable prognostic marker of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In vitro evidence suggests that non-Ig/BCL6 translocation transiently enhances the level of Bcl-6 expression, which may perturb a molecular network that controls the differentiation of GC B-cells to Ig-secreting plasma cells, thereby predisposing the B-cells to neoplastic transformation.",

Specifically, MCL are clonal B-cell neoplasms and often harbor bcl-1 gene rearrangements. Although this genetic profile is well documented, scant or no data are available on the molecular assessment of MCL using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue as a sample source. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to study bcl-1 and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangements (B-cell clonality) using formalin-fixed tissue from 12 cases of MCL. In addition, 12 cases of low grade B-cell lymphoma and 5 cases of reactive lymphocytic hyperplasia were studied as comparison controls. A hemi-nested PCR assay was developed to identify major translocation cluster (MTC) bcl-1 gene rearrangements, whereas IgH gene rearrangements were evaluated by both a single-step and hemi-nested approach. Bcl-1 gene rearrangements were amplified in 4 of 12 (33%) MCL, but in none of the controls. With the hemi-nested approach, B-cell monoclonality was demonstrated in 11 of 12 (92%) MCL; 6 of 6 (100%) small lymphocytic lymphomas; 1 of 2 marginal zone lymphomas; 1 of 4 follicular lymphomas; and 0 of 5 reactive lymphocytic hyperplasias. When one-step PCR was used for B-cell clonality assessment, the overall detection rate was lower, specifically: 8 of 12 (67%) MCL; 4 of 6 (67%) small lymphocytic lymphomas; 1 of 2 marginal zone lymphomas; 0 of 4 follicular lymphomas; and 0 of 5 reactive lymphocytic hyperplasias were identified as monoclonal. We have demonstrated that MTC bcl-1 gene rearrangements can be amplified from formalin-fixed tissue. In addition, monoclonal B-cell populations from MCL are better amplified with a hemi-nested approach rather than a single-step PCR assay. With specialized nucleic acid isolation techniques and appropriate PCR protocol design, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue is an adequate source of DNA for assessing MTC bcl-1 and IgH gene rearrangements.",

We have demonstrated that extrathyroidal extension (ETE) predicts ENE in patients with positive lymph nodes, indicating concordance between primary tumor and lymph node biology. In an effort to determine if there were other histologic features of the primary tumors that indicated an aggressive biology, we examined a subset of patients with intrathyroidal (T1/T2) disease whose lymph nodes had ENE. A review was conducted from January 2004 to March 2013. The histologic features of ETE-negative/ENE-positive tumors (group A, 12 cases) were compared with a random sample of ETE-negative/ENE-negative node-positive patients (group B, 27 cases). Cases were reviewed for size, capsule presence, infiltration, sclerosis, lymphocytic thyroiditis (LT), psammoma bodies, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI), architecture/cytomorphology, and focality. Size was compared using the Mann-Whitney test, while the remaining features were compared using a Fischer exact test. The breakdown of pathologic features of groups A/B were as follows: 2.28 cm/1.46 cm mean tumor size, 90 %/67 % unencapsulated, 100 %/89 % infiltrative, 100 %/89 % sclerotic, 60 %/52 % LT, 30 %/59 % positive psammoma bodies, 0 %/11 % LVI, 0 %/4 % PNI, 90 %/96 % classic architecture, 50 %/44 % multifocal. Neither size (p = 0.072) nor the other nine histologic features examined reached statistical significance. None of the histologic features appeared to significantly predict ENE.

Actually, it raises a problem of public safety for the populations living on these territories that are exposed to low levels of 137Cs during a long period through food. Then it is necessary to study potential effect of this chronic contamination. To mimic this situation, the authors investigate the potential biological effects of chronic exposure to 137Cs at a postaccidental dose (150 Bq/rat/day) on hepatic metabolism of cholesterol in rat. Plasma lipid level, gene expression and activity were analyzed. It was observed that in 137Cs-exposed rats, gene expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr), apolipoprotein B (apoB), and liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) are increased (95%, p < .05; 34%, p < .05; 20%, p < 0.05, respectively), whereas transporter adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter G5 (ABCG5) is decreased (42%, p < .05). In addition, cytochrome P450 27A1 (CYP27A1) activity is increased (34%, p < .05) in contaminated rat liver. In conclusion, the results suggest that 137Cs contamination at low-level induces molecular modifications of the liver cholesterol metabolism without leading to a dysregulation of its homeostasis. These results suggest that chronic long term exposure at low-level of 137Cs may evolve to lipid disorder.",

Excess relative risk is important, being 7.7 for 1 Gy delivered to the thyroid gland during childhood. The risk of thyroid tumours is modified by several factors: a) age at exposure: in childhood, the risk decreases with increasing age at exposure and is not significant after 20 years; b) gender: females are two times more likely than males to develop thyroid tumours; c) genetic predisposition due to a defect in DNA repair mechanisms, and dietary and hormonal factors may modify the risk; d) the influence of fractionation and dose rate is not well established. Radioiodine 131 (1311) used for medical purposes has almost no tumourigenic effect on the adult thyroid gland. The consequences of the Chernobyl accident have clearly shown that the risk of thyroid cancer after exposure to 1311 in childhood is important, and that such exposure should be prevented by potassium iodine prophylaxis.

The susceptibility gene for CS is PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene on 10q23.3 that encodes a lipid phosphatase that lies upstream of protein kinase B (Akt). Interestingly, Carney complex is also a phakomatosis where multiple endocrine neoplasias are prominent and thyroid cancer might be a rare component. One of its susceptibility genes is the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A. Over the course of the last four years, investigators have found the increasing clinical spectrum of syndromes characterized by germline loss-of-function PTEN mutation. In addition to CS, subsets of such disparate syndromes as Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, Proteus syndrome, and possibly VATER with hydrocephalus and megencephaly with autistic features have been found to have germline PTEN mutations. Paradoxically, somatic intragenic PTEN mutations were rare in uncultured primary epithelial thyroid tumors, although hemizygous deletion occurred in 10-20% of thyroid adenomas and carcinomas. However, with subsequent study, it was discovered that epigenetic silencing of PTEN and perhaps inappropriate subcellular compartmentalization were two novel mechanisms of PTEN inactivation pertinent in thyroid carcinogenesis. Ectopic expression studies in vitro have borne out the importance of PTEN in the pathogenesis of epithelial thyroid neoplasias.",

The clinical findings of EDS kyphoscoliotic type (EDS type VIA and B) comprise kyphoscoliosis, muscular hypotonia, hyperextensible, thin and bruisable skin, atrophic scarring, joint hypermobility and variable ocular involvement. Distinct craniofacial abnormalities, joint contractures, wrinkled palms, and normal urinary pyridinoline ratios distinguish EDS VIB from EDS VIA. A genome-wide SNP scan and sequence analyses identified a homozygous frameshift mutation (NM_130468.2:c.145delG, NP_569735.1:p.Val49*) in CHST14, encoding dermatan-4-sulfotransferase 1 (D4ST-1), in two Turkish siblings. Subsequent sequence analysis of CHST14 identified a homozygous 20-bp duplication (NM_130468.2:c.981_1000dup, NP_569735.1:p.Glu334Glyfs*107) in an Indian patient. Loss-of-function mutations in CHST14 were recently reported in adducted thumb–clubfoot syndrome (ATCS). Patients with ATCS present similar craniofacial and musculoskeletal features as the EDS VIB patients reported here, but lack the severe skin manifestations. By identifying an identical mutation in patients with EDS VIB and ATCS, we show that both conditions form a phenotypic continuum. Our findings confirm that the EDS-variant associated with CHST14 mutations forms a clinical spectrum, which we propose to coin as “musculocontractural EDS” and which results from a defect in dermatan sulfate biosynthesis, perturbing collagen assembly.",

However, 'non-ISC, non-SUF' Fe-S biosynthesis factors have been described, both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we report in vitro and in vivo investigations of such a 'non-ISC, non SUF' component, the Nfu proteins. Phylogenomic analysis allowed us to define four subfamilies. Escherichia coli NfuA is within subfamily II. Most members of this subfamily have a Nfu domain fused to a 'degenerate' A-type carrier domain (ATC*) lacking Fe-S cluster co-ordinating Cys ligands. The Nfu domain binds a [4Fe-4S] cluster while the ATC* domain interacts with NuoG (a complex I subunit) and aconitase B (AcnB). In vitro, holo-NfuA promotes maturation of AcnB. In vivo, NfuA is necessary for full activity of complex I under aerobic growth conditions, and of AcnB in the presence of superoxide. NfuA receives Fe-S clusters from IscU/HscBA and SufBCD scaffolds and eventually transfers them to the ATCs IscA and SufA. This study provides significant information on one of the Fe-S biogenesis factors that has been often used as a building block by ISC and/or SUF synthesizing organisms, including bacteria, plants and animals.",

Among them, e-cadherin and catenins--especially α and β--, act as oncogenes during the carcinogenetic process affecting specific signaling transduction pathways (i.e. Wnt/ b-catenin). Concerning thyroid carcinoma, decreased or loss of expression in these proteins seems to affect the biological behavior of the neoplasm increasing its aggressiveness. The aim of this study was to investigate the deregulation of e-cadherin/α-catenin complex in thyroid carcinomas.;Thirty-five paraffin-embedded tissue samples including thyroid carcinomas (N=20) and also 15 cases of benign follicular nodules were cored at 1 mm diameter and transferred to a microarray block. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using anti-e-cadherin/α-catenin antibodies. Digital image analysis was also implemented for measuring the corresponding protein expression levels.;E-cadherin/α-catenin protein expression demonstrated a significant progressive decrease regarding benign and malignant lesions (p=0.001). Simultaneous e-cadherin/α-catenin reduced or loss of expression was observed in 10/20 (50%) cancer cases correlated to advanced stage (especially nodal metastasis) of the examined tumours (p=0.02). Concerning the histological type, combined loss of e-cadherin/α-catenin expression was predominantly associated with follicular and anaplastic histology (p=0.001). Interestingly, α-catenin protein expression pattern was significantly correlated with the grade of differentiation of the examined malignancies (p=0.01).;Progressive loss of e-cadherin mainly and also α-catenin expression is associated with an aggressive phenotype (low differentiation, increased metastatic activity/advanced stage) in thyroid carcinomas.

All these agents induced deletions as well as base changes in the wild-type strain. Thus chemical mutagenesis differed in E. coli and bacteriophages in vitro, for HA, NTG, EMS and perhaps UV produced only point mutations in phage Tr. The patterns of deletion and base-change mutability in E. coli were surprisingly similar. (I) The recombination less recA- strain was mutable by only three (NTG, EMS, HA) of the seven mutagens for either deletions or base changes. (2) The uvrA- strain, unable to excise pyrimidine dimers, was very highly mutable by 4NQO and UV but immutable by MTC for both deletions and base changes. (3) The polA- strain, defective in DNA polymerase I due to a non-suppressible mutation, was very highly mutable by HA and highly mutable by MTC and 4NQO for both deletions and base changes but was highly mutable only for deletions by UV and X-rays, remaining normally mutable by the other agents for both deletions and base changes despite its high sensitivity to their inactivating action. We conclude that errors in the recA-dependent repair of induced DNA damage (after 4NQO, MTC, UV and X-rays) or errors in replication enhanced by damage to the replication system or to the template strands (after NTG, EMS, and HA) give rise to deletions as well as to base changes. From a comparative analysis of 14 dose-response curves for deletions and base changes, we conclude that the order of mutagenic efficiency relative to killing is (EMS, NTG) greater than (UV, 4NQO) greater than HA greater than (X-rays, MTC), and that X-rays, 4NQO, HA and MTC induce more ColBR deletions than Argplus base changes, whereas UV and EMS induce ColBR deletions and Argplus base changes at nearly equal rates and the specificity of NTG is intermediate between these two types.",

The Ras inhibitor farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS, salirasib) attenuates cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and, under certain circumstances, induces cell death. FTS by itself does not induce differentiation or complete growth arrest. The abovementioned activity of VPA as a differentiation agent suggested that it might be worth investigating its possible therapeutic potential in synergistic combination with FTS. Here, we examined whether the combined application of VPA and FTS could synergistically inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells that express oncogenic K-Ras (A549 nonsmall-cell lung carcinoma cells), DLD1 (colon carcinoma cells) or chronically active wild-type K-Ras and constitutively active B-Raf (ARO, thyroid carcinoma cells). The results showed that combined treatment with VPA and FTS synergistically reduces proliferation in all of these cancer cell lines by downregulating Ras and blocking the expression of Survivin and Aurora A. These alterations, which were most pronounced following the combined treatment, led to a mitotic crisis, as reflected by mislocalization of the chromosomal passenger complex. Our findings thus demonstrate that combination therapy with VPA and FTS might offer a promising therapeutic approach to the treatment of epithelial tumors.",

Since 2003 in Denmark, consumers have been able to report ADRs directly to the authorities. The objective of this study was to compare ADRs reported by consumers with ADRs reported from other sources, in terms of their type, seriousness and the suspected medicines involved.;The number of ADRs reported to the Danish ADR database from 2004 to 2006 was analysed in terms of category of reporter, seriousness, category of ADRs by system organ class (SOC) and the suspected medicines on level 1 of the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification system. ADR reports from consumers were compared with reports from other sources (physicians, pharmacists, lawyers, pharmaceutical companies and other healthcare professionals). Chi-square and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to investigate the dependence between type of reporter and reported ADRs (classified by ATC or SOC).;We analysed 6319 ADR reports corresponding to 15 531 ADRs. Consumers reported 11% of the ADRs. Consumers' share of 'serious' ADRs was comparable to that of physicians (approximately 45%) but lower than that of pharmacists and other healthcare professionals. When consumer reports were compared with reports from other sources, consumers were more likely to report ADRs from the following SOCs: 'nervous system disorders' (OR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.05, 1.53); 'psychiatric disorders' (OR = 1.70; 95% CI 1.31, 2.20) and 'reproductive system and breast disorders' (OR = 2.02; 95% CI 1.13, 3.61) than other sources. Compared with other sources, consumers reported fewer ADRs from the SOCs 'blood and lymphatic system disorders' (OR = 0.22; 95% CI 0.08, 0.59) and 'hepatobiliary system disorders' (OR = 0.14; 95% CI 0.04, 0.57). Consumers were more likely to report ADRs from the ATC group N (nervous system) [OR = 2.72; 95% CI 2.34, 3.17], ATC group P (antiparasitic products) [OR = 2.41; 95% CI 1.32, 4.52] and ATC group S (sensory organs) [OR = 4.79; 95% CI 2.04, 11.23] than other sources. Consumers reported fewer ADRs from the ATC group B (blood and blood-forming organs) [OR = 0.04; 95% CI 0.006, 0.32] and the ATC groups J (anti-infective for systemic use) [OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.33, 0.58], L (antioneoplastic and immunomodulating agents) [OR = 0.19; 95% CI 0.12, 0.30] and V (various) [OR = 0.03; 95% CI 0.004, 0.21] than other sources. In the SOC 'nervous system disorders', consumers reported seven categories of ADRs that were not reported by the other sources.;This study showed that compared with other sources, consumers reported different categories of ADRs for different types of medicines.

We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of the 44 patients with primary thyroid lymphoma from 1991 to 2006 at four major referral hospitals in Korea. Out of 44 patients, eight patients were male and 36 patients were female and their average age was 57 years. Fifty-six percent of patients had underlying Hashimoto's thyroiditis. All but two patients had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with B cell origin, and eighty percent of patients presented with stage IE or IIE. Twenty-one of 44 patients (48%) had diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 17 (39%) had MALT lymphoma. Malignancies originating from lymphoid cells were suspected in 10 of eighteen patients with DLBCL (56%) by using fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), and no difference was noted compared with MALT lymphoma (64%). Compared with DLBCL, the patients with MALT lymphoma were more frequently presented with stage I disease (DLBCL vs. MALT lymphoma: 32% vs. 65%, P=0.04). Moreover, in contrast to DLBCL, most of the patients with MALT lymphoma achieved complete response with treatments (DLBCL vs. MALT lymphoma: 53% vs. 94%, P<0.01). Because of the low diagnostic accuracy of FNAC, thyroid biopsy should be considered for the diagnosis of thyroid lymphomas in suspicious cases. The patients with MALT lymphoma were more frequently presented with early stage diseases and this might lead to the favorable outcome to treatments than those with DLBCL.",

In addition, the St. azoricus-like, Metallosphaera species-like and Acidianus species-like cells appeared in similar low abundance in the community.

Cross-reactivity of antisera was 0.0025% and below 0.0001% against PTH and calcitonin in human, respectively. The standard curve of CGRP showed a dose response curve. Results of dilution and reproduction tests were excellent. Normal range of serum CGRP was 6.7 +/- 3.0 pg/ml (M +/- SD) and the cut-off level was determined to be 12.7 pg/ml.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cadherin (CDH)16/kidney-specific-cadherin was first described as a kidney-specific adhesion molecule and thereafter found expressed also in the thyroid gland. We show here that CDH16 fully colocalizes with CDH1/E-cadherin on the basolateral plasma membrane of mouse and human thyrocytes. In thyrocyte cultures, the expression of CDH16 is dependent upon TSH, as other thyroid differentiation markers. In the developing mouse thyroid, CDH16 is expressed at embryonic day 10.5, 1-2 d after the main thyroid-specific transcription factors involved in thyroid cell differentiation. In human thyroid carcinomas, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR, CDH16 expression decreases in papillary, follicular, and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas, and the decrease is more pronounced than that of CDH1. Moreover, by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, it appears that although CDH16-negative tumor cells may still be positive for CDH1, CDH1-negative cells are also negative for CDH16, indicating a more extensive loss of the latter and suggesting that CDH16 loss might precede that of CDH1. Loss of CDH16 appears to be a marker of epithelial-mesenchymal transition as indicated by its decrease in cultured thyroid cells after TGF-β treatment. Finally, the decrease in CDH16 is paralleled in part by the decrease in α B-crystallin, which was proposed to mediate the interaction of CDH16 cytosolic tail with the cell cytoskeleton. In conclusion, CDH16 is a thyroid-selective and hormone-dependent adhesion protein that might play a role during thyroid development and that may be a useful marker to monitor thyroid carcinomas.",

(a) Tumor concentration of 99mTc-EHDP was lowest and the positive delineation of implanted tumor with 99mTc-EHDP was poorest in sequential images, though the active accumulation to some soft tissue maglinant neoplasms, the breast cancer and the thyroid cancer, has been reported. (b) Tumor concentration and tumor to blood ratio of 99mTc-DMSA were not so high on the contrary of our expectation that 197Hg-DMSA may show the high tumor concentration and the high tumor to blood ratio like 197Hg chlormerodrin as same renal scanning radiopharmaceuticals. (c) Tumor concentration of 99mTc-DSDP was highest. Tumor to blood concentration ratio, however, was lower than that of the above mentioned radiopharmaceuticals but tumor to liver ratio and/or tumor to lung ratio was over 1.0 at the earlier time. Biologic distribution of 99mTc-DSDP was similar to that of 32P labeled DSDP and then it is presumed that 99mTc is labeled at phosphate ester of DSDP which is dephospholytated immediately by phospholylase in vivo following the intravenous injection. Therefore, it may be assumed that the accumulation mechanism of 99mTc-DSDP to Ehrlich's tumor is related to the phospholylase activity in neoplasms but is not known precisely.",

Since February 2005, we introduced SRL in liver transplant patients in group a, in whom the primary disease was hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), alcoholic or autoimmune liver cirrhosis, and group b, HCC-negative patients who developed posttransplantation cancers de novo. Of 18 patients in group a, 11 received SRL ab initio (subgroup a1), starting for 10 patients at 66.1+/-29.2 days after surgical healing and after 10 days in 1 case; the remaining 7 patients (subgroup a2) received SRL at 31.2+/-24.2 months. Three patients in group b, included 1 with Kaposi's sarcoma, 1 with bladder cancer, and 1 with thyroid cancer. In this group, SRL was introduced at 80.8+/-40.4 months. In all patients but one, who received a single 5 mg loading dose, SRL was started at 2 mg/d and adjusted to 6 to 8 ng/mL blood levels. CNI drugs, present as primary therapy, were gradually tapered to low levels and eventually stopped. The following observations were drawn from this initial experience: (1) 4/21 (19.0%) patients had to discontinue SRL because of early and late side effects: thrombocytopenia (n=2) and headache with leukopenia and leg edema associated with knee joint arthralgia (n=2); (2) 14 patients (11 in group a and 3 in group b) are still on SRL monotherapy; (3) 1 HCC recurrence and 1 de novo pancreatic adenocarcinoma were observed at 14 and 16 months, respectively (at the time of transplantation, both patients were beyond the MIlan HCC criteria), and (4) 1 patient, from subgroup a1, died after 99 days due to pneumonitis and possible relation to SRL lung toxicity. In conclusion, SRL appeared to be an effective immunosuppressant that could be used as monotherapy in liver transplant patients.

In the present study, we describe at the molecular level the deletions found in the MTC of two (NHL) cases using, (i) DNA obtained from a patient (GUI) with a monosomy 3 and three microdeletions of 101, 22, 25 bp in its unique untranslocated 3q27 allele; (ii) a cell line derived from a patient (VAL) carrying a t(3;4) (q27;p11) translocation and a 2.4 Kbp deletion in the untranslocated allele. As the MTC is recurrently subject to alterations, we have cloned and sequenced the murine equivalent of the human MTC and promoter region in an attempt to identify sequences well conserved in mammals that may be thus important for the LAZ3/BCL6 gene regulation. We show that the human and mouse 5' upstream regions of the LAZ3/BCL6 gene although mainly intronic share a particularly high homology of 79% on the overall sequence. Strikingly, the small sequences which are deleted in patient (GUI) are highly conserved (81%, 100% and 92% respectively). Furthermore, they may play a role in the pathogenesis since proteins prepared from B cell lines and HeLa nuclear extracts bind to these sequences in gel retardation assays. Although a large part of this region is intronic, the high conservation of its sequence and the frequency of alterations in NHLs suggest that they are likely to be significant for the regulation of the LAZ3/BCL6 gene.",
