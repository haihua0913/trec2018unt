We assessed BRAF gain and BRAF mutations in 123 low-grade diffuse gliomas, including 55 diffuse astrocytomas, 18 oligoastrocytomas and 50 oligodendrogliomas. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed BRAF gain in 17/50 (34%) oligodendrogliomas, a significantly higher frequency than in diffuse astrocytomas (7/55; 13%; P = 0.0112). BRAF gain was common in low-grade diffuse gliomas with 1p/19q loss (39%) and those lacking any of the genetic alterations analyzed (31%), but was rare in those with TP53 mutations (2%). Logistic regression analysis showed a significant positive association between 1p/19q loss and BRAF gain (P = 0.0032) and a significant negative association between TP53 mutations and BRAF gain (P = 0.0042). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of 26 low-grade diffuse gliomas with BRAF gain additionally revealed BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion in one oligodendroglioma. Sequencing of cDNA in 17 low-grade diffuse gliomas showed BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion in another oligodendroglioma. A BRAF(V600E) mutation was also detected in one oligodendroglioma, and a BRAF(A598V) in one diffuse astrocytoma. These results suggest that low-grade diffuse gliomas with 1p/19q loss have frequent BRAF gains, and a small fraction of oligodendrogliomas may show BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion.",

Thus, the aim of the present study was to identify the antiproliferative effect of the new oncogenic B-Raf targeting drug UAI-201 on 6 types of glioma cell lines with differing B-Raf mutational status.;The IC50 values of UAI-201 were determined using crystal violet assays in six glioma cell lines. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to assess the functional role of multidrug resistance proteins in response to UAI-201. The effects of UAI-201 on six glioma cells were further examined by immunoblotting analysis, cell cycle analysis, flow cytometric apoptotic assay and autophagy assay. To identify the role of autophagy in UAI-201-induced growth inhibition, Atg5 and Beclin 1 were knocked down by RNA interference.;Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed a poor correlation between UAI-201 activity and the expression level of multidrug resistance proteins. The growth inhibitory effects of UAI-201 correlated with the BRAF-V600E genotype of the glioma cell lines. BRAF blockade with UAI-201 resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of MEK/ERK phosphorylations and increased G0/G1 arrest in glioma cells with BRAF-V600E. Interestingly, UAI-201 preferentially induced autophagy in BRAF-V600E cells, but not in BRAF-WT cells. More notably, autophagy inhibition through siRNA-mediated Beclin 1 knockdown partially attenuated the growth inhibition induced by UAI-201 in BRAF-V600E cells.;The pro-death autophagic processes could be one of the underlying mechanisms for the sensitization of BRAF-V600E glioma cells toward UAI-201.",

In addition, BRAF is mutated in the majority of low-grade gliomas and its expression and activity is significantly increased in the majority of high-grade gliomas. Although the importance of RTKs and RAS signaling in glioma development has been shown, the role of BRAF has yet to be characterized. We evaluated the effect of activated BRAF in glioma formation using the retroviral replication-competent avian leukosis virus long terminal repeat, splice acceptor (RCAS)/TVA system to transfer genes encoding activated forms of BRAF, KRas, Akt and Cre to nestin-expressing neural progenitor cells in Ink4a/Arf(lox/lox) mice in vivo. Although expression of activated BRAF alone is not sufficient for tumorigenesis, the combination of activated BRAF and Akt or BRAF with Ink4a/Arf loss is transforming. Interestingly, activated BRAF generates gliomas with characteristics similar to activated KRas in the context of Akt but not Ink4a/Arf loss.

BRAF mutations are most frequently detected in certain subtypes of low-grade glioma, such as pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA), ganglioglioma (GG) and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT). However, it is unclear whether gliomas harboring BRAF mutations can be invariably regarded as these glioma subtypes or their derivatives. To address this question, we analyzed 274 gliomas in our institutional case series. We performed high-resolution melting analyses and subsequent direct Sanger sequencing on DNA isolated from snap-frozen tumor tissues. As expected, BRAF mutations were detected in the aforementioned low-grade gliomas: in 4/27 PAs, 2/3 PXAs, 4/8 GGs, and 1/6 DNTs. In addition to these gliomas, 1/2 astroblastomas (ABs) and 2/122 glioblastomas (GBs) harbored BRAF mutations. Pathological investigation of the two GBs revealed that one was a GB displaying epithelial features that presumably arose from a precedent GG, whereas the other GB, which harbored a rare G596 A mutation, showed marked epithelial features, including astroblastic rosettes. Our results indicate that in addition to being present in established BRAF-associated gliomas, BRAF mutations might be associated with epithelial features in high-grade gliomas, including sheet-like arrangement of polygonal tumor cells with a plump cytoplasm and astroblastic rosettes, and thus could potentially serve as a genetic marker for these features.",

This oncogenic mutation is also detected in ~5 % of other pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs) including pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) and diffuse astrocytomas. In the current multi-institutional study of 56 non-PXA/non-GG diencephalic pediatric LGGs, the BRAF (V600) mutation rate is 36 %. V600-mutant tumors demonstrate a predilection for infants and young children (<age 3) and have a higher tendency for multicentricity. On neuroimaging, BRAF (V600)-mutant tumors appear as nodular, yet infiltrative contrast-enhancing masses. Morphologic examination reveals a monophasic, predominantly compact and partially infiltrative architecture. Due to the lack of classic morphologic features associated with PAs, pilomyxoid astrocytomas (PMAs), or diffuse astrocytomas, 75 % of the BRAF (V600)-mutant tumors could not be definitively classified on initial histopathologic evaluation. At a median follow-up of 55 months, the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate for BRAF (V600)-mutant diencephalic low-grade astrocytomas (LGAs) was 22 ± 12 %, shorter than BRAF (V600)-WT PAs (52 ± 13 %) but higher than PMAs (10 ± 6 %). Of note, long-term PFS was observed in several adolescent patients with BRAF (V600)-mutant tumors. In children aged 0-12 years, 5-year PFS rate and median PFS in BRAF (V600)-mutant LGAs are 9 ± 9 % and 19 months (95 % CI 3-37 months), respectively. The PFS is comparable to that in BRAF (V600)-WT PMAs (5-year PFS rate: 10 ± 9 %; median PFS: 15 months, 95 % CI 3-32 months; p = 0.96) and significantly shorter than BRAF (V600)-WT PAs (5-year PFS rate: 46 ± 13 %; median PFS: 51 months, 95 % CI 20-∞ months; p < 0.05). In summary, diencephalic BRAF (V600)-mutant pediatric LGAs are associated with unique clinicopathologic features and have a more aggressive clinical course, especially in children under age 13. The low rate of CDKN2A deletion also suggests that these tumors are molecularly distinct from secondary pediatric high-grade gliomas. ",

A four-tiered WHO grading scheme has been successfully applied to a spectrum of diffusely infiltrative astrocytomas, but it is not fully applicable to other gliomas, including oligodendrogliomas and ependymomas. Recent genetic studies have revealed that the major categories of gliomas, such as circumscribe astrocytomas, infiltrating astrocytomas/oligodendrogliomas, and glioblastoma, roughly correspond to major genetic alterations, including isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) 1/2 mutations, TP53 mutations, co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p/19q, and BRAF mutation/fusion. These genetic alterations are clinically significant in terms of the response to treatment(s) and/or the prognosis. It is, thus, rational that future classification of gliomas should be based on genotypes, rather than phenotypes, although the genetic features of each tumor are not sufficiently understood at present to draw a complete map of the gliomas, and genetic testing is not yet available worldwide, particularly in Asian and African countries.

Despite the lack of a complete understanding of the biology of these tumors, significant advances have been made in the past decades. One of the key discoveries made in the area of malignant gliomas is that these tumors can be induced and maintained by aberrant signaling networks. In this context, the Ras pathway has been extensively exploited, from both basic and translational perspectives. Although somatic oncogenic mutations of Ras genes are frequent in several cancer types, early investigations on gliomas revealed disappointing facts that the Ras mutations are nearly absent in malignant gliomas and that the BRAF mutations are present in a very small percentage of gliomas. Therefore, the observed deregulation of the Ras-RAF-ERK signaling pathway in gliomas is attributed to its upstream positive regulators, including, EGFR and PDGFR known to be highly active in the majority of malignant gliomas. In contrast to the initial negative results on the somatic mutations of H-Ras, K-Ras and BRAF, recent breakthrough studies on pediatric low-grade astrocytomas uncovered genetic alterations of the BRAF gene involving copy number gains and rearrangements. The 7q34 rearrangements result in a novel in-frame KIAA1549:BRAF fusion gene that possesses constitutive BRAF kinase activity resembling oncogenic BRAF (V600E). In light of the earlier findings and recent breakthroughs, this review summarizes our current understanding of the Ras-RAF-ERK signaling pathway in gliomas and the outcome of preclinical and clinical studies that evaluated the efficacy of Ras-targeted therapy in malignant gliomas.",

Polymerase chain reaction testing identified KIAA1549:BRAF fusions in 51 (48%) tumors overall, including 42 (60%) pilocytic astrocytomas, 4 (17%) unclassifiable low-grade gliomas, 4 (36%) low-grade glioneuronal/neuroepithelial tumors, 0 (of 5) pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, 0 (of 4) diffuse astrocytomas (World Health Organization grade II), and 1 (of 3, 33%) pilomyxoid astrocytoma. KIAA1549:BRAF gene fusions confirmed by sequencing included the previously reported ones involving exons 1-16/9-18 (49%), 1-15/9-18 (35%), and 1-16/11-18 (8%) and 2 fusions with novel breakpoints: 1-15/11-18 (6%) and 1-17/10-18 (1%). DNA sequencing identified BRAF mutations in 8% of tumors. BRAF mutations were absent. KIAA1549:BRAF fusions were significantly more frequent in infratentorial (57%) and optic pathway (59%) tumors versus supratentorial (19%) tumors (p = 0.001). We did not identify significantly improved progression-free survival in tumors with fusions. In summary, KIAA1549:BRAF fusions predominate in pilocytic astrocytomas but are also present in some low-grade unclassifiable gliomas and glioneuronal tumors. The prognostic and therapeutic significance of this alteration is unclear and merits further study.",

Despite showing initial anti-tumor activity, acquired drug resistance significantly limits the benefit from being treated with BRAFV600E inhibitors. Here, we have identified molecular responses to BRAFV600E inhibitor treatment in human glioma models that have substantial clinical implications. Specifically, we show that BRAFV600E inhibitor resistant cells upregulate pro-survival mediators such as Wnt, and additionally increase receptor tyrosine kinase activity, including EGFR and Axl, promoting resistance to BRAFV600E inhibition.

Exome sequencing and array CGH were performed on available samples followed by detailed genetic analysis of the entire sHGG cohort. Clinical and outcome data of genetically distinct subgroups were obtained.;sHGG was observed in 2.9% of PLGGs (26 of 886 patients). Patients with sHGG had a high frequency of nonsilent somatic mutations compared with patients with primary pediatric high-grade glioma (HGG; median, 25 mutations per exome; P = .0042). Alterations in chromatin-modifying genes and telomere-maintenance pathways were commonly observed, whereas no sHGG harbored the BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion. The most recurrent alterations were BRAF V600E and CDKN2A deletion in 39% and 57% of sHGGs, respectively. Importantly, all BRAF V600E and 80% of CDKN2A alterations could be traced back to their PLGG counterparts. BRAF V600E distinguished sHGG from primary HGG (P = .0023), whereas BRAF and CDKN2A alterations were less commonly observed in PLGG that did not transform (P < .001 and P < .001 respectively).

Recent efforts at comprehensive genetic characterization of various primary brain tumor types have identified a number of common alterations and pathways common to multiple tumor types. Common pathways in glioma biology include growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and their downstream signaling via the MAP kinase cascade or PI3K signaling, loss of apoptosis through p53, cell cycle regulation, angiogenesis via VEGF signaling, and invasion. However, in addition to these common general pathway alterations, a number of specific alterations have been identified in particular tumor types, and a number of these have direct therapeutic implications. These include mutations or fusions in the BRAF gene seen in pilocytic astrocytomas (and gangliogliomas). In oligodendrogliomas, mutations in IDH1 and codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q are associated with improved survival with upfront use of combined chemotherapy and radiation, and these tumors also have unique mutations of CIC and FUBP1 genes. Low grade gliomas are increasingly seen to be divided into two groups based on IDH mutation status, with astrocytomas developing through IDH mutation followed by p53 mutation, while poor prognosis low grade gliomas and primary glioblastomas (GBMs) are characterized by EGFR amplification, loss of PTEN, and loss of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. GBMs can be further characterized based on gene expression and gene methylation patterns into three or four distinct subgroups. Prognostic markers in diffuse gliomas include IDH mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and MGMT methylation, and MGMT is also a predictive marker in elderly patients with glioblastoma treated with temozolomide monotherapy.

        "Doc_abstract":"Brain tumors are the most common solid pediatric malignancy. For high-grade, recurrent, or refractory pediatric brain tumors, radiation therapy (XRT) is an integral treatment modality. In the era of personalized cancer therapy, molecularly targeted agents have been designed to inhibit pathways critical to tumorigenesis. Our evolving knowledge of genetic aberrations in pediatric gliomas is being exploited with the use of specific targeted inhibitors. These agents are additionally being combined with XRT to increase the efficacy and duration of local control. In this review, we discuss novel agents targeting three different pathways in gliomas, and their potential combination with XRT. BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase in the RAS/RAF/MAPK kinase pathway, which is integral to cellular division, survival, and metabolism. Two-thirds of pilocytic astrocytomas, a low-grade pediatric glioma, contain a translocation within the BRAF gene called KIAA1549:BRAF that causes an overactivation of the MEK/MAPK signaling cascade. In vitro and in vivo data support the use of MEK or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in low-grade gliomas expressing this translocation. Additionally, 15-20% of high-grade pediatric gliomas express BRAF V600E, an activating mutation of the BRAF gene. Pre-clinical in vivo and in vitro data in BRAF V600E gliomas demonstrate dramatic cooperation between XRT and small molecule inhibitors of BRAF V600E. Another major signaling cascade that plays a role in pediatric glioma pathogenesis is the PI3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR pathway, known to be upregulated in the majority of high- and low-grade pediatric gliomas. Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are in clinical trials for adult high-grade gliomas and are poised to enter studies of pediatric tumors. Finally, many brain tumors express potent stimulators of angiogenesis that render them refractory to treatment. An analog of thalidomide, CC-5103 increases the secretion of critical cytokines of the tumor microenvironment, including IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-10, and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of recurrent or refractory pediatric central nervous system tumors. In summary, several targeted inhibitors with radiation are currently under investigation in both translational bench research and early clinical trials. This review article summarizes the molecular rationale for, and the pre-clinical data supporting the combinations of these targeted agents with other anti-cancer agents and XRT in pediatric gliomas. In many cases, parallels are drawn to molecular mechanisms and targeted inhibitors of adult gliomas. We additionally discuss the potential mechanisms underlying the efficacy of these agents.",

Common genetic lesions observed in PA, which are linked to aberrant ERK pathway activity, include either NF1 inactivation, KRAS or BRAF gain-of-function mutations. To investigate the mutation spectrum within the proto-oncogene encoding the Ser/Thr-kinase B-Raf in more detail, we analyzed 64 primary tumor samples from children with PA including two patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The well-known BRAF(V600E)  mutation was found in 6/64 (9.38%) of our samples. For the first time, we report concomitant presence of a somatic BRAF(V600E)  mutation in an NF1 patient indicating that more than one Ras/ERK pathway component can be affected in PA. Furthermore, 2/64 (3.13%) of our samples carried a 3-bp insertion in BRAF resulting in the duplication of threonine 599. This conserved residue is located within the activation segment and, if phosphorylated in a Ras-dependent manner, plays a key role in Raf activation. Here, we demonstrate that this mutant (B-Raf(insT) ) and another B-Raf mutant, which carries two additional threonine residues at this position, display an in vitro kinase activity and cellular MEK/ERK activation potential comparable to those of B-Raf(V600E) . Notably, replacement of threonines by valine residues had similar effects on B-Raf activity, suggesting that the distortion of the peptide backbone by additional amino acids rather than the insertion of additional, potential phosphorylation sites destabilizes the inactive conformation of the kinase domain.

Precise classification and grading are essential due to different therapeutic strategies prompted by diagnoses of pilocytic astrocytoma WHO grade I, diffuse astrocytomas WHO grade II or anaplastic astrocytoma WHO grade III. Recently, genomic aberrations with a high specificity for distinct glioma entities have been described. Pilocytic astrocytomas carry a duplication at chromosome band 7q34 containing a BRAF-KIAA1549 gene fusion in the majority of cases. IDH1 mutations are observed very frequently in adult astrocytomas and IDH2 mutations have been reported in some astrocytomas. We examined a series of 120 astrocytomas including 70 pilocytic astrocytomas WHO grade I and 50 diffuse astrocytomas WHO grade II for both, BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion with a newly developed FISH assay and mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 by direct sequencing. Pilocytic astrocytomas contained the BRAF fusion in 49 cases (70%) but neither IDH1 nor IDH2 mutations. Astrocytomas WHO grade II exhibited IDH1 mutations in 38 cases (76%) but neither IDH2 mutations nor BRAF fusions. Thus, combined molecular analysis of BRAF and IDH1 is a sensitive and highly specific approach to separate pilocytic astrocytoma from diffuse astrocytoma.",

Initially described in melanoma, colon and papillary thyroid carcinoma, these alterations have also been observed in primary nervous system tumors albeit at a low frequency. We analyzed exon 15 of BRAF spanning the V600 locus by direct sequencing in 1,320 adult and pediatric tumors of the nervous system including various types of glial, embryonal, neuronal and glioneuronal, meningeal, adenohypophyseal/sellar, and peripheral nervous system tumors. A total of 96 BRAF mutations were detected; 93 of the V600E type and 3 cases with a three base pair insertion between codons 599 and 600. The highest frequencies of BRAF (V600E) mutations were found in WHO grade II pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (42/64; 66%) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas with anaplasia (15/23; 65%), as well as WHO grade I gangliogliomas (14/77; 18%), WHO grade III anaplastic gangliogliomas (3/6) and pilocytic astrocytomas (9/97; 9%). In pilocytic astrocytomas BRAF (V600E) mutation was strongly associated with extra-cerebellar location (p = 0.009) and was most frequent in diencephalic tumors (4/12; 33%). Glioblastomas and other gliomas were characterized by a low frequency or absence of mutations. No mutations were detected in non-glial tumors, including embryonal tumors, meningiomas, nerve sheath tumors and pituitary adenomas. The high mutation frequencies in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, gangliogliomas and extra-cerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas implicate BRAF (V600E) mutation as a valuable diagnostic marker for these rare tumor entities. Future clinical trials should address whether BRAF (V600E) mutant brain tumor patients will benefit from BRAF (V600E)-directed targeted therapies.",

NF1 is caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene, which codes for neurofibromin, a large protein involved in the MAPK- and the mTOR-pathway through RAS-RAF signalling. NF1 is a known tumour predisposition syndrome, associated with different tumours of the nervous system including low grade gliomas (LGGs) in the paediatric population. The focus of this review is on grade I pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs), the most commonly observed histologic subtype of low grade gliomas in NF1. Clinically, these PAs have a better prognosis and show different localisation patterns than their sporadic counterparts, which are most commonly associated with a KIAA1549:BRAF fusion. In this review, possible mechanisms of tumourigenesis in LGGs with and without NF1 will be discussed, including the contribution of different signalling pathways and tumour microenvironment. Furthermore we will discuss how increased understanding of tumourigenesis may lead to new potential targets for treatment. ",

Although oncogenic rearrangements of the BRAF gene have recently been described in PAs, it is not clear whether such alterations have an impact on outcome. An institutional cohort of 147 PAs (118 with outcome data) from both cerebellar and non-cerebellar locations (spine, diencephalon, midbrain, brainstem, and cortex) was utilized in this study. Parameters included quantification of characteristic morphologic variables as well as genes and molecular loci previously shown to be of relevance in high-grade gliomas, including 1p, 9p, 10q, 17p, 19q, and BRAF. Neither 1p, 9p, and 10q nor 19q showed significant association with outcome in PAs, although p16 deletion was more common in PAs of the midbrain, brainstem, and spinal cord. Loss of heterozygosity on 17p13 correlated with increased risk of recurrence in cerebellar tumors. BRAF gene rearrangements were more common in cerebellar tumors than non-cerebellar tumors and associated with classic biphasic histology in the cerebellum. However, clinical outcome was independent of BRAF status. The molecular biology of PAs differs according to location, yet BRAF rearrangements do not appear to produce PAs with different behavior. Nevertheless, such tumors may have altered sensitivity to pathway-specific adjuvant therapy. Additionally, deletion on 17p13 may be an adverse prognostic biomarker in cerebellar tumors.",

Furthermore, the levels of phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK), a downstream effector of RAS, are also increased. In mice, activated KRas cooperates with the loss of INK4a-ARF locus or with activated Akt to induce gliomas, confirming an important role for this pathway in glioma biology. However, to correctly target therapies against the RAS signaling pathway, it is necessary to identify the effectors that contribute to RAS-mediated gliomagenesis. In this study, we investigated the contribution of RAF signaling in glioma oncogenesis. We find that the levels of RAF-1 and BRAF proteins and RAF kinase activity are increased in human GBM samples. We confirm the importance of this finding by demonstrating a causal role for a constitutively active Raf-1 mutant in glioma formation in mice. Specifically, we find that activated Raf-1 cooperates with Arf loss or Akt activation to generate gliomas similar to activated KRas under the same conditions. Our study suggests that the oncogenic effect of KRas in glioma formation may be transduced at least in part through Raf signaling and that therapeutic targeting of this pathway may be beneficial in glioma treatment.",

This can be particularly challenging with small biopsies that often yield limited amounts of tissue for pathologic study, especially considering the marked differences in prognosis and therapy after a pathologic diagnosis. This paper will review some basic principles of gliosis as an astrocytic reaction to a wide range of central nervous system insults and focus on some common diagnostic pitfalls such as (1) gliosis associated with brain tumor mimics, including demyelinating disease and infections, (2) gliosis associated with nonglial tumors such as craniopharyngioma, hemangioblastoma, metastases, and central nervous system lymphoma. New diagnostic methods have facilitated the differentiation between reactive astrocytosis and the diffuse gliomas. Of these, the use of mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH-1) as a marker of diffuse infiltrating astroctomas, oligodendrogliomas, and a subset of glioblastomas (secondary glioblastomas) is particularly exciting for tissue diagnosis and patient prognosis. In addition IDH-1 may be useful to distinguish a diffuse infiltrating glioma from low-grade \"focal\" neoplasms such as the pilocytic astocytoma in histologically ambiguous cases. The discovery of BRAF mutations as molecular signatures of some pilocytic astrocytomas, gangliogliomas, and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas has provided another diagnostic tool for the pathologist. Only after a definitive diagnosis of a diffuse infiltrating glioma or a focal glioma is made should a tumor grade be applied and some practical issues in current glioma grading are provided.",

Sporadic cases are associated with KIAA1549:BRAF fusion rearrangements, while 15-20% of children develop PA in the context of the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) inherited tumor predisposition syndrome. The unique predilection of these tumors to form within the optic pathway and brainstem (NF1-PA) and cerebellum (sporadic PA) raises the possibility that gliomagenesis requires more than biallelic inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene or expression of the KIAA1549:BRAF transcript. Several etiologic explanations include differential susceptibilities of preneoplastic neuroglial cell types in different brain regions to these glioma-causing genetic changes, contributions from non-neoplastic cells and signals in the tumor microenvironment, and genomic modifiers that confer glioma risk. As clinically-faithful rodent models of sporadic PA are currently under development, Nf1 genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) models have served as tractable systems to study the role of the cell of origin, deregulated intracellular signaling, non-neoplastic cells in the tumor microenvironment and genomic modifiers in gliomagenesis.

In these cancers, various genetic aberrations of the BRAF proto-oncogene, such as different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, have been reported.

Indeed, recent clinical trials involving BRAF selective inhibitors exhibited promising response rates in metastatic melanoma patients. Clinical trials are underway for other cancers. However, cutaneous side effects of treatment have been reported and therapeutic response to cancer is short-lived due to the emergence of several resistance mechanisms.

In recent years molecular studies have identified a number of genetic and epigenetic markers that could contribute to an improved tumor classification and better prediction of response to therapy and prognosis in the individual patient. The most important molecular tests with differential diagnostic relevance in patients with astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors include the detection of genetic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), IDH2, alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX), histone H3.3 (H3F3A) and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) genes as well as the demonstration of codeletions of chromosomal arms 1p and 19q. Important predictive markers that have been linked to the response to alkylating chemotherapy are O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation in glioblastoma patients and 1p/19q codel status in anaplastic glioma patients. Oncogenic c11orf95/RELA fusion gene formation is characteristic for a subgroup of patients with supratentorial ependymoma. In addition to diagnostic testing of individual genes, novel microarray and next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques show promising perspectives in glioma diagnostics. The assessment of DNA methylation profiles using DNA methylation arrays representing 450,000 CpG dinucleotides distributed throughout the human genome (450 k array test) now allows the robust molecular classification of gliomas into clinically relevant entities and variants. Moreover, glioma-associated gene panel NGS promises the timely parallel sequencing of relevant diagnostic and predictive marker genes in a single test. It will now be a major task to integrate these novel results and techniques into the conventional histological procedures in the up-coming revision of the WHO classification. ",

BRAF V600E mutation is characteristically found in approximately 50% of all E-GBMs, compared with a low frequency of this mutation in conventional GBM. Here, we report an unusual case of glioma involving the right frontal lobe, basal ganglia and thalamus in an HIV-positive 30-year-old man on antiretroviral therapy. The lesion was composed of abundant discohesive, monotonous epithelioid cells with extensive necrosis, spindle and polyhedral cells, low-grade oligoastrocytoma-like areas, sarcomatous components, and numerous osteoclast-like giant cells (OLGCs) intermingled with epithelioid tumor cells. As the epithelioid cells accounted for more than one-third of the tumor, a pathological diagnosis of E-GBM was made. BRAF V600E mutation was detected in both oligoastrocytoma-like and epithelioid cell components. Similar to previously reported findings on E-GBM associated with low-grade glioma, this case suggested that low-grade astrocytic glioma with BRAF V600E mutation progressed to E-GBM. OLGCs are rarely observed in gliomas, and this is the first case report of E-GBM associated with abundant OLGC infiltration.",

While the genetic profiles of common LGNTs, such as the pilocytic astrocytoma and 'adult-type' diffuse gliomas, are largely established, those of uncommon LGNTs remain to be defined. In this study, we have used massively parallel sequencing and various targeted molecular genetic approaches to study alterations in 91 LGNTs, mostly from children but including young adult patients. These tumors comprise dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNETs; n = 22), diffuse oligodendroglial tumors (d-OTs; n = 20), diffuse astrocytomas (DAs; n = 17), angiocentric gliomas (n = 15), and gangliogliomas (n = 17). Most LGNTs (84 %) analyzed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) were characterized by a single driver genetic alteration. Alterations of FGFR1 occurred frequently in LGNTs composed of oligodendrocyte-like cells, being present in 82 % of DNETs and 40 % of d-OTs. In contrast, a MYB-QKI fusion characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (87 %), and MYB fusion genes were the most common genetic alteration in DAs (41 %). A BRAF:p.V600E mutation was present in 35 % of gangliogliomas and 18 % of DAs. Pathogenic alterations in FGFR1/2/3, BRAF, or MYB/MYBL1 occurred in 78 % of the series. Adult-type d-OTs with an IDH1/2 mutation occurred in four adolescents, the youngest aged 15 years at biopsy. Despite a detailed analysis, novel genetic alterations were limited to two fusion genes, EWSR1-PATZ1 and SLMAP-NTRK2, both in gangliogliomas. Alterations in BRAF, FGFR1, or MYB account for most pathogenic alterations in LGNTs, including pilocytic astrocytomas, and alignment of these genetic alterations and cytologic features across LGNTs has diagnostic implications. Additionally, therapeutic options based upon targeting the effects of these alterations are already in clinical trials. ",

As the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion gene is detected at a much lower frequency in diffuse low-grade astrocytomas and survival was much longer than expected in the patients with a 'non-pilocytic' astrocytoma carrying the fusion gene, identification of this fusion gene can be of diagnostic and prognostic value.

There have been many advances over the last two decades as we widen our search for a molecular basis of gliomagenesis. Many biomarkers have been discovered to be important in the management of gliomas, including 1p19q co-deletion, MGMT promoter methylation, BRAF and IDH1 mutations. In this review, we attempt to summarise the available literature on these biomarkers and their use in the diagnosis and management of gliomas. We pay special attention to the recently discovered IDH1 mutation, which is already proving to be a valuable new marker for favourable prognosis and may also indicate a greater response to therapy. 1p19q co-deletions have been shown to delineate a clinically distinct tumour type and are now routinely tested for in certain situations and can help direct treatment. MGMT promoter methylation is one of the most commonly studied biomarkers in gliomas. It has been shown to be a strong positive prognostic marker in gliomas, with positive tumours being more sensitive to chemotherapy. However, a lack of alternatives means that it is not yet a routine mutation tested for clinically. BRAF mutations are new markers found in pilocytic astrocytomas. Although the prognostic value of such mutations is not yet known, they may play a significant role in the diagnosis and treatment of such tumours. IDH1 mutations are 'the new kid on the block' and seem to play a central role in the pathogenesis of gliomas. They represent an independent and favourable prognostic marker and are a new molecular marker for disease diagnosis. Its role in determining response to chemotherapy is still controversial but with further study, IDH1 mutations may prove to be an invaluable marker in the management of gliomas.",

The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma brain metastases and in other cancer diseases. Therefore the BRAF V600E mutation is a highly interesting oncological target in brain tumors.;This study assesses the BRAF V600E mutation status in 969 intracranial neoplasms using a tissue microarray method and immunohistochemical staining with the mutation-specific VE-1 antibody, followed by sequencing of positively stained cases.;Out of 784 primary brain tumors seven cases with a BRAF V600E mutation were detected (7/784, 1 %). Six of these cases were neuroepithelial tumors (6/667, 1 %) encompassing 2 astrocytomas WHO grade II (2/42, 5 %), 1 gliosarcoma WHO grade IV (1/75, 1 %) and 3 glioblastomas WHO grade IV (3/312, 1 %). Interestingly, all three mutant glioblastomas showed epithelioid histopathological features. Patients with V600E mutated astrocytic tumors were significantly younger (mean age 15.3 years) than wildtype cases (58.2 years). Among three rhabdoid meningiomas, one case was mutated (1/3) while all other grade I-III meningiomas (1/116, 1 %) and all fifty vestibular schwannomas analyzed were of wildtype status. The vast majority of the BRAF V600E mutations were found in cerebral metastases of malignant melanomas and carcinomas (29/135, 22 %), with false-positive staining found in four breast cancer cases and two non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) samples.;Our data suggest routine screening for BRAF V600E mutations for glioblastomas WHO grade IV below the age of 30, especially in glioblastomas with epithelioid features and in all rhabdoid meningiomas WHO grade III. For colorectal carcinoma, thyroid cancer, malignant melanoma and gliomas BRAF V600E immunostaining is sufficient for screening purposes. We also recommend routine immunohistochemical staining followed by sequencing validation in rare CNS metastases or metastases of unknown primary. Immunohistochemical analysis using mutation-specific antibodies on tissue microarrays is a feasible, time- and cost-efficient approach to high-throughput screening for specific mutations in large tumor series but sequencing validation is necessary in unexpected cases.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Gliomas are the most frequent tumors of the central nervous system. The WHO classification, based on the presumed cell origin, distinguishes astrocytic, oligodendrocytic and mixed gliomas. A grading system is based on the presence of the following criteria: increased cellular density, nuclear atypias, mitosis, vascular proliferation and necrosis. The main histological subtype of grade I gliomas are pilocytic astrocytomas, which are benign. Diffuse astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas are low-grade (II) or high-grade (III and IV) tumors. Glioblastomas correspond to grade IV astrocytomas. C. Daumas-Duport et al. have proposed another classification based on histology and imaging data, which distinguishes oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas of grade A (without endothelial proliferation and/or contrast enhancement), oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas of grade B (with endothelial proliferation or contrast enhancement), glioblastomas and glioneuronal malignant tumors. Both classifications lack reproducibility. Many studies have searched for a molecular classification. Recurrent abnormalities in gliomas have been found. They encompassed recurrent chromosomal alterations, such as lost of chromosome 10, gain of chromosome 7, deletion of chromosome 1p and 19q, but also activation of the Akt pathway (amplification of EGFR), dysregulation of the cell cycle (deletion of p16, p53). These studies have enabled the description of two molecular subtypes for glioblastomas. De novo glioblastomas, which occur in young patients without of a prior history of brain tumor and harbor frequent amplification of EGFR, deletion of p16 and mutation of PTEN while mutation of p53 is infrequent. Secondary glioblastomas occur in the context of a preexisting low-grade glioma and are characterized by more frequent mutation of p53. On the other side, combined complete deletion of 1p and 19q as the result of the translocation t(1;19)(q10;p10) is highly specific of oligodendrogliomas. However, histological and molecular classifications do not always correspond as many alterations are shared by high-grade tumors, whatever their histological type. Besides, few molecular alterations have a prognostic value. Among them combined 1p19q loss is associated with a better prognosis and response to treatment for oligodendrogliomas. Another promising marker is MGMT, a DNA repairing enzyme. If inactivated (by methylation of the promoter of the gene) a better sensitivity is observed with nitrosoure agents. However, some concerns exist for the method of detection of this abnormality. Quality control for molecular techniques is also required before using them for therapeutic strategy. In the future, studies of gene expression profiles by cDNA-microarray as well as works in the field of neural progenitor cells will probably provide new insights in gliomagenesis.",

We investigated TERT promoter and BRAF mutation frequency in respectively 94 and 86 consecutive MPNST cases from our institute. TERT promoter mutation analysis on DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens was performed by SNaPshot analysis. Sequence analysis of BRAF was performed by bidirectional DNA sequencing.

One co-occurrence of a TERT promoter- and a BRAF mutation was observed. In comparison with other neuroectodermal derived malignant neoplasms, TERT promoter mutations occur at relatively low frequency in MPNSTs.

However, optimal incorporation of molecular markers into clinical care is still controversial. Here, the potential utility of genetic alterations found in gliomas in refining histological diagnosis, prognosis, and predictive values for treatment selection is reviewed. Among all, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, 1p/19q codeletion, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations have been identified as favorable prognostic markers. MGMT promoter methylation is the only potential predictive marker for response to temozolomide and alkylating agents in glioblastoma (GBM), but it is not of assistance in diagnostics. IDH1 mutations and 1p/19q codeletion are also useful for classifying and grading gliomas, since 1p/19q codeletion is tightly linked to oligodendroglial lineage, and IDH1 mutations are restricted to grade II/III gliomas, while not to primary GBM. BRAF fusion is a good marker for pilocytic astrocytoma. High-throughput profiling techniques for gene expression and epigenetic modification have provided new subtype classifications for GBM as well as lower grade gliomas, which may be of prognostic and predictive values.

Understanding the genetic alterations that drive glioma formation and progression may help improve patient prognosis by identification of novel treatment targets. Recently, two major studies have performed in-depth mutation analysis of glioblastomas (the most common and aggressive subtype of glioma). This systematic approach revealed three major pathways that are affected in glioblastomas: The receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, the TP53 pathway and the pRB pathway. Apart from frequent mutations in the IDH1/2 gene, much less is known about the causal genetic changes of grade II and III (anaplastic) gliomas. Exceptions include TP53 mutations and fusion genes involving the BRAF gene in astrocytic and pilocytic glioma subtypes, respectively. In this review, we provide an update on all common events involved in the initiation and/or progression across the different subtypes of glioma and provide future directions for research into the genetic changes.

We investigated genomic alterations in 25 pilocytic astrocytomas, including 5 supratentorial and 20 posterior fossa tumors, using oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization. Large changes were identified in 7 tumors and included gains of chromosomes 5, 6, and 7 and losses of chromosomes 16, 17, 19, and 22. The most common alteration was a 1.9-MB region of low-level gain at chromosome 7q34 identified in 17 of 20 posterior fossa tumors. In most tumors, the region of gain ended within the BRAF locus and encompassed only exons that encode the BRAF kinase domain. We confirmed copy number increase at the 7q34 locus using quantitative polymerase chain reaction with primers adjacent to the HIPK2, RAB19B, and BRAF genes. Western blot analysis revealed that 3 of 6 pilocytic astrocytomas with 7q34 gain contained high levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and nitrogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK), while 1 tumor lacking 7q34 gain and 2 normal brain specimens did not. Immunohistochemical stains of a tissue microarray containing 43 pilocytic astrocytoma identified ERK phosphorylation in 35 (81%). These data indicate that focal gains at chromosome 7q34 and increased BRAF-MEK-ERK signaling are common findings in sporadic pilocytic astrocytomas.",

Although these tumors are typically slow growing, they may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality because of recurrence and malignant progression, even in the setting of optimal resection. LGG in pediatric and adult age groups are currently classified by morphologic criteria. Recent years have heralded a molecular revolution in understanding brain tumors, including LGG. Next-generation sequencing has definitively demonstrated that pediatric and adult LGG fundamentally differ in their underlying molecular characteristics, despite being histologically similar. Pediatric LGG show alterations in FGFR1 and BRAF in pilocytic astrocytomas and FGFR1 alterations in diffuse astrocytomas, each converging on the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Adult LGG are characterized by IDH1/2 mutations and ATRX mutations in astrocytic tumors and IDH1/2 mutations and 1p/19q codeletions in oligodendroglial tumors. TERT promoter mutations are also noted in LGG and are mainly associated with oligodendrogliomas. These findings have considerably refined approaches to classifying these tumors. Moreover, many of the molecular alterations identified in LGG directly impact on prognosis, tumor biology, and the development of novel therapies. ",

The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion typically results from a 2.0 Mb tandem duplication in chromosome band 7q34. In the present study, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based array analysis of three LGGs demonstrated deletions in 7q34 that resulted in a BRAF fusion. Case 1 was likely a pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) with three deletions in 7q33q34 and an exon 15-9 KIAA1549-BRAF fusion. SNP array analysis of case 2, a possible dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT), revealed a 2.6 Mb deletion, which included the 5' end of BRAF and extended to the 3' end of FAM131B. In case 3, deletions involving BRAF and FAM131B were observed in both a primary and a recurrent PA. RNA-based sequence analysis of cases 2 and 3 confirmed a fusion between FAM131B exon 2 and BRAF exon 9. The presence of fusion transcripts in these three LGGs highlights the utility of SNP array analysis to identify deletions that are suggestive of fusion proteins. BRAF fusions can result from multiple non-overlapping deletions, suggesting various complex mechanisms of formation. ",

This article provides an overview and critical appraisal of the types of genetic and epigenetic aberrations that have gained significance in the molecular diagnostics of gliomas, namely deletions of chromosome arms 1p and 19q, promoter hypermethylation of the O6-methylguanine-methyl-transferase (MGMT) gene, and the mutation status of the IDH1 and IDH2 genes. In addition, the frequent oncogenic aberration of BRAF in pilocytic astrocytomas may serve as a novel diagnostic marker and therapeutic target.

Several proteinases released by invading tumor cells appear to participate in the focal degradation of extracellular matrix proteins.

The amount of cathepsin B activity and protein content were highest in glioblastomas, lower in anaplastic astrocytomas and lowest in normal brain tissue and low-grade gliomas. There were significantly higher amounts of M(r) 25,000 and 26,000 bands in glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma than in normal brain and low-grade glioma tissue extracts as determined by Western blotting with anti-cathepsin antibodies. In addition, cathepsin B transcripts were overexpressed in anaplastic astrocytoma (about two- to three-fold), in glioblastoma (about eight- to 10-fold), compared with normal brain tissue and low-grade glioma. Immunohistochemical staining for cathepsin B showed intense immunoreactivity in tumor and endothelial cells of glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas but only weak immunoreactivity in low-grade glioma and normal brain tissues. Therefore, we conclude that cathepsin B expression is greatest in highly malignant astrocytomas, especially in glioblastomas, and is correlated with the malignant progression of astrocytomas.",

The purpose of this study was to clarify the incidence of B-RAF mutations and their possible relation with tumor progression in a series of 82 human gliomas, including 49 astrocytic and 33 oligodendroglial tumors.

Both mutations were located in the hotspot residue 600 (V600E) at exon 15, which leads to constitutive B-RAF kinase activity.

Pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve is an equally indolent subtype that is occasionally associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. In earlier studies, this subtype was considered within the larger category of 'optic pathway glioma,' which included infiltrating astrocytomas and other hypothalamic tumors. However, there have been suggestions that gliomas in the optic nerve, and especially pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve, are biologically different from tumors within the hypothalamus and other parts of the optic tract. Furthermore, the recent discovery of BRAF duplication and fusion with the KIAA1549 gene is reported to be more typical for posterior fossa tumors, and the rate of this aberration is not well known in pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve. To determine the distinction of pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve from pilocytic astrocytoma of the posterior fossa and to investigate the prevalence of BRAF aberrations, we reviewed the clinicopathological and molecular features of all such patients in our institution. Our study demonstrates that BRAF duplication is more frequent in posterior fossa tumors compared with pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve (P=0.011). However, the rates of phospho-MAPK1 and CDKN2A expression were high in both pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve and posterior fossa pilocytic astrocytoma, suggesting that the MAPK pathway is active in these tumors. Our study supports the notion that BRAF duplication is more typical of posterior fossa pilocytic astrocytoma and that molecular alterations other than KIAA1549 fusion may underlie MAPK pathway activation in pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve.

In pediatric low-grade diffuse gliomas, an intragenic duplication of the portion of FGFR1 encoding the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) and rearrangements of MYB/MYBL1 were found recurrently and mutually exclusively.

B-FABP is also expressed in astrocytoma tumors and in some malignant glioma cell lines. To address the role of B-FABP in malignant glioma, we have studied the growth properties of clonal populations of malignant glioma cells modified for B-FABP expression. Here, we demonstrate that expression of B-FABP in B-FABP-negative malignant glioma cells is accompanied by the appearance of radial glial-like properties, such as increased migration and extended bipolar cell processes, as well as reduced transformation. Conversely, B-FABP depletion in B-FABP-positive malignant glioma cells results in decreased migration, reduction in cell processes, and a more transformed phenotype. Moreover, expression of B-FABP in astrocytomas is associated with regions of tumor infiltration and recurrence. Rather than being a direct manifestation of the tumorigenic process, we propose that the ability of high-grade astrocytoma cells to migrate long distances from the primary tumor reflects properties associated with their cell of origin.

Diffuse PLGGs comprise a set of uncommon subtypes that exhibit invasive growth and are therefore especially challenging clinically. We performed high-resolution copy-number analysis on 44 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded diffuse PLGGs to identify recurrent alterations. Diffuse PLGGs exhibited fewer such alterations than adult low-grade gliomas, but we identified several significantly recurrent events. The most significant event, 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs and resulted in partial duplication of the transcription factor MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas in the related gene v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) on 6q23.3. Whole-genome sequencing of a MYBL1-rearranged diffuse astrocytoma grade II demonstrated MYBL1 tandem duplication and few other events. Truncated MYBL1 transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional tumors with MYBL1 partial duplication. Our results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.",

BRAF alterations and Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) point mutations are key molecular alterations in Pas, but their clinical implications are not established. We aimed to determine the frequency and prognostic role of these alterations in a cohort of 69 patients with PAs. We assessed KIAA1549:BRAF fusion by fluorescence in situ hybridization and BRAF (exon 15) mutations by capillary sequencing. In addition, FGFR1 expression was analyzed using immunohistochemistry, and this was compared with gene amplification and hotspot mutations (exons 12 and 14) assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and capillary sequencing. KIAA1549:BRAF fusion was identified in almost 60% of cases. Two tumors harbored mutated BRAF. Despite high FGFR1 expression overall, no cases had FGFR1 amplifications. Three cases harbored a FGFR1 p.K656E point mutation. No correlation was observed between BRAF and FGFR1 alterations. The cases were predominantly pediatric (87%), and no statistical differences were observed in molecular alterations-related patient ages. In summary, we confirmed the high frequency of KIAA1549:BRAF fusion in PAs and its association with a better outcome. Oncogenic mutations of FGFR1, although rare, occurred in a subset of patients with worse outcome. These molecular alterations may constitute alternative targets for novel clinical approaches, when radical surgical resection is unachievable.",

Current therapies rely on neurosurgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or combination of these conventional modalities and although histopathology helps to direct therapy, molecular pathology has so far not played a major role in the management of paediatric glioma. However, increasing knowledge of glioma biology is starting to impact on drug development towards targeted therapies. Pilocytic astrocytoma, the most common childhood low grade brain tumour, has recently been shown to harbour an activated BRAF/MAPK/ERK pathway in the majority of cases; this represents an attractive target for new agents. The molecular biology of adult malignant glioma is now well described and targeted therapies against VEGFR are already playing a role in the management of glioblastoma. It is likely that high grade gliomas in children and adults share common aberrant molecular pathways but the frequency and mechanisms involved probably will exhibit key differences and on-going comprehensive molecular analyses of paediatric high grade glioma are essential to determine which targets are important in children. However, selection for specific targeted therapy is unlikely to be based on, or restricted by, age but will require individual case by case testing for target presence in order to direct and maximise the efficacy of molecular therapy. Brainstem glioma remains a tumour with a dismal prognosis but relatively little is known about the underlying biology and progress will require a concerted effort to collect tissue by biopsy and autopsy to allow appropriate analysis to identify and validate targets. A new era of molecular based therapies offers the promise of major benefits in the management of paediatric glioma but translating this promise into reality will require further understanding of the biology driving these tumours.",

A totall of 26 eligible studies with 2224 cases were included in this systematic review of publications to 20 June, 2016. Genetic biomarkers such as isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations, low expression of excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2), high xCT expression, overexpression of adenosine kinase (ADK) and low expression of very large G-protein-coupled receptor-1 (VLGR1) are primarily involved in synaptic transmission, whereas BRAF mutations, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification, miR-196b expression and low ki-67 expression are associated with regulation of cell proliferation.

Understanding the mechanisms involved in glioma invasion could lead to new therapeutic strategies. We have previously shown that BEHAB/brevican, an extracellular matrix protein in the central nervous system, plays a role in the invasive ability of gliomas. The mechanisms that underlie BEHAB/brevican function are not yet understood, due in part to the existence of several isoforms that may have different functions. Here we describe for the first time the expression of BEHAB/brevican in human brain and characterize two novel glioma-specific isoforms, B/b(sia) and B/b(Deltag), which are generated by differential glycosylation and are absent from normal adult brain and other neuropathologies. B/b(sia) is an oversialylated isoform expressed by about half the high- and low-grade gliomas analyzed. B/b(Deltag) lacks most of the carbohydrates typically present on BEHAB/brevican and is the major up-regulated isoform of this protein in high-grade gliomas but is absent in a specific subset of low-grade, indolent oligodendrogliomas. B/b(Deltag) is detected on the extracellular surface, where it binds to the membrane by a mechanism distinct from the other BEHAB/brevican isoforms. The glioma-specific expression of B/b(Deltag), its restricted membrane localization, and its expression in all high-grade gliomas tested to date suggest that it may play a significant role in glioma progression and make it an important new potential therapeutic target. In addition, its absence from benign gliomas prompts its use as a diagnostic marker to distinguish primary brain tumors of similar histology but different pathologic course.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Pilocytic astrocytomas occur rarely in adults and show aggressive tumor behavior. However, their underlying molecular-genetic events are largely uncharacterized. Hence, we studied 59 adult pilocytic astrocytoma (APA) cases of classical histology (MIB-1 LI:1-5%). Analysis of BRAF alterations using qRT-PCR, confirmed KIAA1549-BRAF fusion in 11(19%) and BRAF-gain in 2(3.4%) cases. BRAF-V600E mutation was noted in 1(1.7%) case by sequencing. FGFR1-mutation and FGFR-TKD duplication were seen in 7/59(11.9%) and 3/59(5%) cases respectively. Overall 36% of APAs harbored BRAF and/or FGFR genetic alterations. Notably, FGFR related genetic alterations were enriched in tumors of supratentorial region (8/25,32%) as compared to other locations (P=0.01). The difference in age of cases with FGFR1-mutation (Mean age±SD: 37.2±15) vs KIAA1549-BRAF fusion (Mean age±SD: 25.1±4.1) was statistically significant (P=0.03). Combined BRAF and FGFR alterations were identified in 3(5%) cases. Notably, the cases with more than one genetic alteration were in higher age group (Mean age±SD: 50±12) as compared to cases with single genetic alteration (Mean age±SD: 29±10)(P= 0.003). Immunopositivity of p-MAPK/p-MEK1 was found in all the cases examined. pS6-immunoreactivity, a marker of mTOR activation was observed in 34/39(87%) cases. Interestingly, cases with BRAF and/or FGFR related alteration showed significantly lower pS6-immunostatining (3/12;25%) as compared to those with wild-type BRAF and/or FGFR (16/27;59%)(P=0.04). Analysis of 7 IDH wild-type adult diffuse astrocytomas (DA) showed FGFR related genetic alterations in 43% cases. These and previous results suggest that APAs are genetically similar to IDH wild-type adult DAs. APAs harbor infrequent BRAF alterations but more frequent FGFR alterations as compared to pediatric cases. KIAA1549-BRAF fusion inversely correlates with increasing age whereas FGFR1-mutation associates with older age. Activation of MAPK/ERK/mTOR signaling appears to be an important oncogenic event in APAs and may be underlying event of aggressive tumor behavior. Our findings provide a rationale for potential therapeutic advantage of targeting MAPK/ERK/mTOR pathway in APAs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

PCR and sequencing confirmed the presence of five KIAA1549-BRAF fusion variants, along with a single fusion between SRGAP3 and RAF1. The resulting fusion genes lack the auto-inhibitory domains of BRAF and RAF1, which are replaced in-frame by the beginning of KIAA1549 and SRGAP3, respectively, conferring constitutive kinase activity. An activating mutation of KRAS was identified in the single pilocytic astrocytoma without a BRAF or RAF1 fusion.

Here we report that BRAF(V600E) expression in neural progenitors (NPs) is insufficient for tumorigenesis and increases NP cellular differentiation as well as apoptosis. In contrast, astrocytomas are readily generated from NPs with additional Ink4a-Arf deletion. The BRAF(V600E) inhibitor PLX4720 significantly increased survival of mice after intracranial transplant of genetically relevant murine or human astrocytoma cells. Moreover, combination therapy using PLX4720 plus the Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-specific inhibitor PD0332991 further extended survival relative to either monotherapy.

Cathepsin D activity and content were higher in anaplastic astrocytoma and in glioblastoma tissue extracts especially when compared to normal brain tissue and low-grade gliomas.

        "Doc_abstract":"In order to clarify the role of fibronectin in glioma invasion in vivo, we analyzed the relationship between fibronectin-stimulated cell migration and adhesion in 14 primary glioma cells and the expression of fibronectin and the fibronectin receptor in the corresponding tumor tissues. The tumors comprised nine glioblastomas (GB) and five anaplastic gliomas (AG) consisting of two astrocytomas, two oligoastrocytomas and one ependymoma. All glioma cells tested in the primary cell culture were found to migrate to fibronectin in a dose-dependent manner. The extent of cell migration to fibronectin was not significantly different for the GB and AG groups. On the other hand, cell adhesion to fibronectin in the AG was much stronger than that in the GB group. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that fibronectin positively stained in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in eight cases and that the fibronectin receptor was positive in tumor cell membranes in 10 cases. In addition, cellular fibronectin isoforms containing ED-A and ED-B sequences were found to be immunolocalized in the tumor cells and the ECM of GB. These isoforms were also specifically expressed in tumor vessels within tumor tissues, but not in those within normal brain tissues. Cell migration tended to be expressed more strongly by glioma cells derived from tumor tissues in which fibronectin was positively immunolocalized in the ECM than from tissues with negative fibronectin in the ECM. Four glioma cells derived from GB whose tumor cells did not positively stain for fibronectin receptors migrated much less extensively to fibronectin than other glioma cells whose tissues showed positive staining for the fibronectin receptor. Of these four GB, two had loss of heterozygosity in the locus of fibronectin receptor beta1 gene. These results suggest that fibronectin deposited in the extracellular matrix of tumors, which can be derived from both plasma and the tumor cell itself, strongly promotes the migration of glioma cells, and that expression of the fibronectin receptor may play a critical role in the biological behavior of the tumor cells, particularly in fibronectin-stimulated cell migration in vivo.",

Disease-free survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Tumors with low cystatin C protein expression and high cathepsin B protein expression were significantly more likely to be of high grade, and this pattern was significantly correlated with high Ki-67 LI and tumor recurrence. Depressed expression of cystatin C messenger RNA in glioblastomas compared with low-grade astrocytomas was demonstrated. Multivariate analysis demonstrated high tumor grade, high Ki-67 labeling index, high cathepsin B expression, and low cystatin C expression correlated significantly with shorter disease-free survival.

The effect of B-TGF on proliferation of clonogenic cells from 12 human glioma biopsies was registrated in a thymidine incorporation assay. B-TGF appeared to be a potent growth inhibitor for some gliomas, while it had no effect on others. Maximum inhibition was about 60%. Though not significant, glioblastomas appeared to be less sensitive to inhibition by B-TGF than astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. Very little is known about the growth inhibitory action of B-TGF. The negative autocrine growth theory for cancer cells postulates that a reduced production, or production of a defective growth inhibitor normally found in the cell, may account for the autonomous nature of some cancer cells. In view of this theory, we searched for B-TGF in protein extracts from a glioblastoma cell line, T-MGl, whose growth was inhibited by B-TGF. Protein extract from T-MGl cells was analysed for B-TGF activity using a soft agar colony formation assay with normal rat kidney fibroblasts. B-TGF was not found in the extract. Since, according to the literature B-TGF has been found in all other cell lines examined, we believe that there may be a lack of B-TGF or an altered B-TGF in the gliomas whose growth are inhibited by B-TGF.

Fifteen patients with astrocytoma (AC) [11 male (mean age +/- standard deviation) 40 +/- 11 years], nine with oligodendroglioma (OD) (four male, 45 +/- 13 years) and three with oligoastrocytoma (OA) (two male, 60 +/- 11 years) were recruited and diffusion-weighted images (b = 0 and 1000 s mm(-2)) were acquired every 6 months to date or until malignant transformation. Whole tumour ADC histograms were calculated, a multiple discriminant analysis was performed and quantitative morphological parameters extracted, the AC and OD subtypes were then compared using Student's unpaired t-test. Classification of the histograms was also performed. ODs had significantly lower group ADC values than ACs and up to 83% of the subjects could be correctly classified into the OD and AC groups by reference to the histogram.

This strongly suggests that this pathway is necessary for glioma formation and maintenance. To further define the role of this pathway in the development of high-grade gliomas, we used the established RCAS/TVA glioma mouse model to test the ability of activated MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK), a RAF effector, to induce tumors in vivo in the context of activated AKT or Ink4a/Arf loss. Although expression of activated MEK alone in neural progenitor cells is not sufficient for tumorigenesis, the combination of activated MEK and AKT or MEK with Ink4a/Arf loss is transforming. The data reveal that activation of the classical RAS/MAPK pathway, which is mediated through MEK, leads to the development of high-grade gliomas in vivo and suggest that MEK may be a relevant target for glioma therapy. To test this, we treated both mouse and human glioma cells with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901. Although this treatment induced apoptosis in a significant percentage of the cells, the effect was enhanced by combined treatment with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235. Our results demonstrate that combined inhibition of MEK and PI3K/mTOR is a rational strategy for the treatment of high-grade gliomas and may be an effective adjuvant therapy for this disease.",

A defining aspect of the glioma TME is the unique composition and structure of its extracellular matrix (ECM), which enables tumor cells to overcome the inhibitory barriers of the adult central nervous system (CNS). In this way, the TME plays a role in glioma invasion and the cellular heterogeneity that distinguishes these tumors. Brain Enriched Hyaluronan Binding (BEHAB)/brevican (B/b), is a CNS-specific ECM constituent and is upregulated in the glioma TME. Previous studies have shown B/b exerts a pro-invasive function, suggesting it may represent a target to reduce glioma pathogenesis. Herein, we also provide evidence that B/b expression is enriched in the glioma initiating cell (GIC) niche. We demonstrate that B/b plays roles in the pathological progression, aggressiveness, and lethality of tumors derived from human GICs and traditional glioma cell lines. Interestingly, we found that B/b is not required to maintain the defining phenotypic properties of GICs and thereby acts primarily in late stages of glioma progression.

In previous studies, we demonstrated that uPA levels are significantly higher in anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma than in low-grade glioma and normal brain tissue. In the present study, our goal was to determine whether the increase in uPA production in higher-grade gliomas is caused by an increase in mRNA stability or increased transcription of the gene in three human glioma cell lines of various grades (H4, SW1783, UWR3). The half-life of uPA mRNA was about 14 h in UWR3 and 8 h in SW1783 cells. In transient transfection studies of the wild-type -2109-bp human uPA promoter in the different grades of cell lines, the uPA promoter activity was increased two-fold in SW1783, anaplastic astrocytoma cells and six-fold in UWR3 glioblastoma cells, as compared with the uPA promoter activity in low-grade H4 cells. Using human uPA promoter chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) constructs with mutations of the AP-1 element at -1967 or the PEA-3 cis element at -1973, the activity of the uPA promoter was decreased 4-fold to 10-fold in all three human glioma cell lines. In transient transfection assays, the uPA promoter was stimulated 2.2-fold in UWR3 and SW1783 cells and 3.7-fold in H4 cells in response to phorbol-12-myristat-13-acetate. We further studied the activation and inhibition of uPA promoter by co-expression of a transactivation domain lacking c-jun: a dominant negative ERK1 and ERK2 mutant and a dominant negative c-raf in glioblastoma cell line showed repressed uPA promoter activity compared with the effect of the empty expression vector. We conclude from our findings that increased transcription is the more likely mechanism underlying the increase in uPA production in high-grade gliomas.",

This increase correlated with increases in protein abundance (from + to ) as measured by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, in glioblastoma cell lines increases in transcript abundance (ranging from 3- to 12-fold) were accompanied by increases in enzyme activity (44-133 nmol/min x mg protein). Altered subcellular localization was observed both immunohistochemically and by indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and was found to correlate with increased grade.

ATF5, in turn, promotes survival by stimulating transcription of myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 (MCL1), an antiapoptotic B cell leukemia-2 family member. Analysis of human malignant glioma samples indicates that ATF5 expression inversely correlates with disease prognosis. The RAF kinase inhibitor sorafenib suppresses ATF5 expression in glioma stem cells and inhibits malignant glioma growth in cell culture and mouse models.

The VE1 antibody that recognizes the V600E-mutant BRAF protein is one such example. We have recently shown that the vast majority of papillary craniopharyngiomas-tumors that arise in the sellar or suprasellar regions of the brain-harbor BRAF V600E mutations. The VE1 antibody can be effective in discriminating papillary craniopharyngioma from adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma, which harbors mutations in CTNNB1 and not BRAF. While further characterizing the use of the VE1 antibody in the differential diagnosis of suprasellar lesions, we found that the VE1 antibody stains the epithelial cells lining Rathke's cleft cysts with very strong staining of the cilia of these cells. We used targeted sequencing to show that Rathke's cleft cysts do not harbor the BRAF V600E mutation. Moreover, we found that the VE1 antibody reacts strongly with cilia in various structures-the bronchial airways, the fallopian tubes, the nasopharynx, and the epididymis-as well as with the flagella of sperm. In addition, VE1 reacts strongly with the cilia of the ependymal lining of the brain and with the cilia-containing microlumens of ependymoma tumors. There is significant sequence homology between the synthetic peptide (amino acid 596-606 of BRAF V600E: GLATEKSRWSG) that was used to generate the VE1 antibody and regions of multiple axonemal dynein heavy chain proteins (eg, DNAH2, DNAH7, and DNAH12). These proteins are major components of the axonemes of cilia and flagella where they drive the sliding of microtubules. In ELISA assays, we show that the VE1 antibody recognizes epitopes from these proteins. A familiarity with the cross-reactivity of the VE1 antibody with epitopes of proteins in cilia is of value when evaluating tissues stained with this important clinical antibody. ",

Targeted sequencing of mutational hotspots in H3F3A, IDH1/2, and BRAF, and genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation and copy number abnormalities was performed in available tumors. Thirty-two patients [23 (72 %) with type 1 and 9 (28 %) with type 2 GC] were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 10.2 years (range 1.5-19.1). A median of 4 cerebral lobes (range 3-8) was affected at diagnosis. In addition, symmetrical bithalamic involvement was observed in 9 (28 %) patients. Twenty-two patients (69 %) had an anaplastic astrocytoma. Despite aggressive therapy, only two patients younger than 3 years at diagnosis are long-term survivors. Clustering analysis of methylation array data from 18 cases classified tumors as IDH (n = 3, 17 %), G34 (n = 4, 22 %), mesenchymal (n = 3, 17 %), and RTK I 'PDGFRA' (n = 8, 44 %).

Our aim was to assess the feasibility of discriminant analysis applied to histograms of preoperative diffusion tensor imaging-derived images for the prediction of glioma grade validated by histomorphology.;Tumors of 40 consecutive patients included 13 grade II astrocytomas, seven oligoastrocytomas, six grade II oligodendrogliomas, three grade III oligoastrocytomas, and 11 glioblastoma multiformes. Preoperative DTI data comprised: unweighted (B (0)) images, fractional anisotropy, longitudinal and radial diffusivity maps, directionally averaged diffusion-weighted imaging, and trace images. Sampling consisted of generating histograms for gross tumor volumes; 25 histogram bins per scalar map were calculated. The histogram bins that allowed the most precise determination of low-grade (LG) or high-grade (HG) classification were selected by multivariate discriminant analysis. Accuracy of the model was defined by the success rate of the leave-one-out cross-validation.;Statistical descriptors of voxel value distribution did not differ between LG and HG tumors and did not allow classification. The histogram model had 88.5% specificity and 85.7% sensitivity in the separation of LG and HG gliomas; specificity was improved when cases with oligodendroglial components were omitted.;Constructing histograms of preoperative radiological images over the tumor volume allows representation of the grade and enables discrimination of LG and HG gliomas which has been confirmed by histopathology.",

Its role in the prognosis and tumourigenesis of gliomas remains unclear. In the present study, we found that RKIP protein is absent in a low frequency (10%, 20/193) of glioma tumors. Nevertheless, the absence of RKIP expression was an independent prognostic marker in glioma. Additionally, by in vitro downregulation of RKIP, we found that RKIP inhibition induces a higher viability and migration of the cells, having no effect on cellular proliferation and angiogenesis, as assessed by in vivo CAM assay. In conclusion, this is the largest series studied so far evaluating the expression levels of this important cancer suppressor protein in glioma tumors.

According to WHO classification, gliomas are classified into four different malignant grades ranging from grade I to grade IV based on histopathological features and related molecular aberrations. The induction and maintenance of these tumors can be attributed largely to aberrant signaling networks. In this regard, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) network has been widely studied and is reported to be severely altered in glial tumors. Mutations in MAPK pathways most frequently affect RAS and B-RAF in the ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 pathways leading to malignant transformation. Also, it is linked to both inherited and sequential accumulations of mutations that control receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-activated signal transduction pathways, cell cycle growth arrest pathways, and nonresponsive cell death pathways. Genetic alterations that modulate RTK signaling can also alter several downstream pathways, including RAS-mediated MAP kinases along with JNK pathways, which ultimately regulate cell proliferation and cell death.

The expression of glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B is observed to be aberrantly regulated in glioma tissues and cells, and high levels of glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B present an inverse correlation with the survival of glioma patients. Compared with the control, glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B inhibition significantly retarded the proliferation and migration of human glioma cells. The tube formation ability of HBMECs induced by glioma cells was also remarkably reduced by glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B silencing. Increased levels of VEGF-C and TEM7 were down-regulated by the suppression of glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B in glioma cells. Additionally, the activity of MMP-2/3/9 was assessed in glioma cells using Western blotting and gelatin zymography assay; their activities were strongly decreased following the suppression of glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B. Further studies suggested that canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway was activated, but was inactivated by glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B suppression in glioma cells.

HA-induced glioma invasion was driven by two important molecular events: matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion and up-regulation of cell migration. MMP secretion was triggered by HA-induced focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation, which transmits its signal through ERK activation and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) translocation. Another important molecular event is osteopontin (OPN) expression. OPN expression by AKT activation triggers cell migration.

This study aims to elucidate the glioma cell-derived ADAM10 (A Disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10) in the suppression of CD8+ effector T cells by the induction of regulatory B cells. In this study, glioma cells were isolated from surgically removed glioma tissue and stimulated by Phorbol myristate acetage (PMA) in the culture. The levels of ADAM10 in the culture were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immune cells were assessed by flow cytometry. The results showed that the isolated glioma cells express ADAM10, which was markedly up regulated after stimulated with PMA. The glioma-derived ADAM10 induced activated B cells to differentiate into regulatory B cells, the later suppressed CD8+ T cell proliferation as well as the induced regulatory T cells, which also showed the immune suppressor effect on CD8+ effector T cell proliferation. In conclusion, glioma cells produce ADAM10 to induce Bregs; the latter suppresses CD8+ T cells and induces Tregs. ",

Using immunohistochemistry, 77 glioma specimens were evaluated for their expression of ETBR and infiltrating T lymphocytes, including an analysis of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs). The number of ETBR-positive vessels in the glioblastomas (Grade IV) was significantly higher than in other grades of gliomas (comparisons to Grade IV, Grade I: p = 0.0323, Grade II: p = 0.0009, Grade III: p = 0.0273). The ETBR expression rate (defined as the number of ETBR-positive blood vessels divided by the total number of blood vessels) in the glioblastomas was higher than the ETBR expression rate in the low-grade gliomas (compared to Grade IV, Grade I: p = 0.0132, Grade II: p = 0.0018, Grade III: p = 0.0745). In addition, the cases which had an ETBR expression rate of 50 % or higher exhibited fewer infiltrating CTLs and more infiltrating Tregs compared to the cases with an ETBR expression rate <50 % (CTLs: p = 0.0342; Tregs: p = 0.0175). Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH-1) mutations were identified in 21 cases, but there was no correlation between ETBR expression and IDH-1 mutations for any WHO grade.

It has important significance to improve the treatment of glioma through in-depth understanding the intracerebral metabolic characteristics and pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutics. Brain microdialysis (B-MD), an effective method to monitor central nervous system anticancer drug disposition, conditions of drugs through the blood-brain barrier, basic pathophysiologic metabolism, bioactive compounds and the changes of neurotransmitter in brain, provides the unique opportunity to allow the simultaneous determination of unbound concentrations of drugs in several tissues, and directly measure gliomas biochemistry continuously. B-MD has been able to monitor the change of brain drugs, metabolites and neurotransmitters, dynamic analysis of the drug concentration and pharmacological effect after administration, pharmacodynamic interaction between drugs, receptor mechanism of drug transport, as well as feedback information of internal environment. B-MD is expected to provide reference for clinical individual chemotherapy of glioma, but also provide powerful tools for the evaluation of new anticancer drugs in vivo.

The up-regulated protein kinase B could influence the expression of cyclooxygenase-2, an indicator of aggressive glioma. The present study was embarked to demonstrate the effect of naringenin (50 mg/kg bw for 30 days administrated orally) on PI3K, protein kinase B, and cyclooxygenase-2 in cerebrally implanted rat C6 glioma model. After the experimental period of 30 days, the animals were sacrificed and excised brain tissues were subjected to study the expressions of PI3K, protein kinase B, and cyclooxygenase-2 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction followed Western blot analysis. The activity of COX-2 (production of prostaglandin-E(2)) was also determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. The results showed that the naringenin could down-regulate the expressions of PI3K and protein kinase B along with activity and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in C6 glioma cells implanted rat brain. In conclusion, it can be argued that the reduced expressions of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B in naringenin-treated glioma-induced rat brain might be involved in the down-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression and activity.

Thus, in the present study, MAO-B activity in membranes of glial tumours (n=20), meningiomas (n=12) and non-pathological human brains (n=15) was quantified by [14C]PEA oxidation.

There were no significant differences in MAO-B activity between glioblastoma multiformes (n=11) and low-grade astrocytomas (n=3) or anaplastic astrocytomas (n=6). In conclusion, the present results demonstrate a significant and selective increase in MAO-B activity in human gliomas when compared with meningiomas or non-tumoural tissue.

Expression levels significantly increased with malignancy of the gliomas. 87.5% of grade III and IV, but only 4% of grade II tumors expressed high levels of mRNA. Elevation of IL-10 serum levels was found in 11% of low grade and in 63.6% of high grade glioma patients. In situ hybridization analysis with combined immunohistochemistry revealed that: a) IL-10 is not produced by infiltrating B- or T- lymphocytes, b) both microglia and astroglia contributed to IL-10 expression in malignant gliomas in vivo. These data suggested the functional role of IL-10 in glioma progression. Therefore, the effects of IL-10 on proliferation and migration of glioma cells were determined in vitro. Two human glioma cell lines were grown as monolayer as well as spheroids in the presence of different concentrations of IL-10.

Mice with established GL261 brain gliomas were vaccinated subcutaneously with H-2(b) GL261 glioma cells fused with H-2(d) RAG-neo cells or with a mock vaccine of phosphate-buffered saline.

In contrast, spleen cells of tumor-bearing, mock-vaccinated mice produced lower levels of cytokines in the presence of tumor-conditioned media. However, these results also show that there was not a heightened level of cytokine production in the presence of tumor-conditioned medium by spleen cells of vaccinated mice over the production by spleen cells of control mice.

Routine histological preparations and post-contrast preoperative MRI/CT-scan were simultaneously reviewed in order to assess the impact on survival of the following features: presence or absence of a polymorphous or gemistocytic astrocytic component, of necrosis and of contrast enhancement (CH); endothelial hyperplasia (EH) assessed as absent, present minor (HE+) or (HE++) when conform to the threshold of HE defined in the SA grading system of oligodendrogliomas. The tumors were graded A: no CH and no EH; in B: CH and /or HE++, and A/B: EH + but no CE.;70.1% of the tumors were classified as \"pure\" oligodendroglioma, 19.5% as \"polymorphous oligo-astroastrocytoma\" and 10.3% as \"gemistocytic oligo-astrocytoma\". In grade A, or B tumors, the presence of a polymorphous or a gemistocytic component had no significant influence on survival; however respectively 53% and 65% of these tumours versus 32% of \"pure\" oligodendrogliomas were grade B at the time of diagnosis. In either histological subtypes, survival was not significantly different when HE was absent or minor (HE+). After regrouping of the histological subtypes and of the tumors with HE+ or absent, the series included 153 oligodendrogliomas grade A and 98 grade B. Survival in patients with grade A versus grade B tumors was respectively 142 versus 52 months (p<0.0001). In grade B tumors, necrosis had no significant influence on survival. Ring-shaped contrast enhancement surrounding large foci of necrosis was observed in only 4 cases. In tumors with or without CE, patient survival was respectively 148 versus 40 months (p<0.0001). On post contrast MRI done in 235 patients, only 7 tumors (3%) were grade A/B (EH++ but no CH).;From these results and our previous observation that, according to the SA classification of gliomas, only oligodendrogliomas or oligo-astrocytomas may not show CE, we propose that for retrospective studies: 1) tumors diagnosed according to the Ste-Anne classification as oligodendroglioma or oligo-astrocytoma be regrouped in a unique category, 2) independent of their histological type and grade according to the WHO, gliomas that do not show CE be regrouped with SA oligodendrogliomas grade A, 3) concerning gliomas that show CE on MRI: oligodendrogliomas or oligo-astrocytomas WHO grade II or III, as well as WHO secondary glioblastomas or glioblastomas with an oligodendroglial component, be regrouped with SA oligodendrogliomas grade B; however tumors that show ring-like CE surrounding large foci of necrosis and finger-like \"peritumoral\" edema should be excluded or analysed separately.",

In this study, we found that miR-19a was significantly upregulated in human glioma tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-19a by a miR-19a mimic promoted glioma cell proliferation and invasion. In contrast, miR-19a inhibitor suppressed cell proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, by a dual-luciferase reporter assay and expression analysis, we determined that Ras homolog family member B was a direct target of miR-19a. Knockdown of Ras homolog family member B could block cell proliferation and invasion induced by the miR-19a mimic. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that miR-19a upregulation is common in gliomas and that suppression of miR-19a expression inhibits cell proliferation and invasion, which indicates that miR-19a may act as an oncogene in gliomas.

Molecular classification was of clear prognostic significance and correlated better with outcome than did classical histopathology. In 1p/19q codeleted tumors, outcome was not affected by CIC and FUBP1 mutations. MGMT promoter methylation remained the most predictive factor for survival benefit of PCV chemotherapy.;Targeted NGS allows a clinically relevant classification of diffuse glioma into groups with very different outcomes.

There is considerable experimental evidence that VEGF isoforms are strongly involved in provoking neoangiogenesis of neoplastic cells and, consequently, the growth and progression of primary neoplasms (i.e., astrocytic gliomas), including the formation of an invasive and metastatic immunophenotype (IP). During this immunohistochemical study, the presence and tissue localization of VEGF121 was observed in anaplastic, high-grade astrocytomas (AAs) and in glioblastoma multiforme (GBMs) employing the specific monoclonal antibody against it. A sensitive, four-step, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antigen detection technique was used. The immunoreactivity demonstrated a cytoplasmic, cell surface and extracellular matrix localization pattern in more than 90% of the tumor cells, with high intensity immunoreactivity (++++, A,B) in every high-grade astrocytic glioma tissue. VEGF121 expression was identified mostly within the cytoplasm of tumor cells, suggesting an embryonic, undifferentiated and more malignant cellular IP of high-grade gliomas. Tumor-related neo-angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation were also present. The great majority of high-grade astrocytic gliomas are incurable with the three classic therapeutic modalities. In the future, the development of targeted anti-neoplastic treatment strategies, adapted to individual patients, will require molecular identification of the different classes of neoplasm (including subtypes of astrocytomas) according to their stages, biology, prognosis and therapeutic options.",

Here, we observed that p53 inactivation by transfection with pCMV-E6 sensitized U87MG cells to BCNU. Compared with control U87MG-neo cells with intact p53 function, the clonogenic survival of U87MG-E6 cells exposed to BCNU was reduced significantly. In U87MG-E6 cells, sensitization to BCNU was associated with failure of p21(WAF1) induction, transient cell cycle arrest in S phase, accumulation of polyploid cells, and significant cell death. In contrast, resistance to BCNU in U87MG-neo cells was associated with up-regulation of p53, prolonged induction of p21(WAF1), sustained cell cycle arrest in S phase, and enhancement of DNA repair. U87MG cells with disrupted p53 function were less able to repair BCNU-induced DNA damage and survive this chemotherapeutic insult. The question arises of whether p53 dysfunction might be a chemosensitizing genetic alteration in human astrocytic gliomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Brain invasion is a biological hallmark of glioma that contributes to its aggressiveness and limits the potential of surgery and irradiation. Deregulated expression of adhesion molecules on glioma cells is thought to contribute to this process. Junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) include several IgSF members involved in leukocyte trafficking, angiogenesis, and cell polarity. They are expressed mainly by endothelial cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Here, we report JAM-C expression by human gliomas, but not by their normal cellular counterpart. This expression correlates with the expression of genes involved in cytoskeleton remodeling and cell migration. These genes, identified by a transcriptomic approach, include poliovirus receptor and cystein-rich 61, both known to promote glioma invasion, as well as actin filament associated protein, a c-Src binding partner. Gliomas also aberrantly express JAM-B, a high affinity JAM-C ligand. Their interaction activates the c-Src proto-oncogene, a central upstream molecule in the pathways regulating cell migration and invasion. In the tumor microenvironment, this co-expression may thus promote glioma invasion through paracrine stimuli from both tumor cells and endothelial cells. Accordingly, JAM-C/B blocking antibodies impair in vivo glioma growth and invasion, highlighting the potential of JAM-C and JAM-B as new targets for the treatment of human gliomas.",

In this study we investigated the status of FOXO3a expression and related signaling in human glioma in order to test its potential value as a therapeutic target for this disease.

Only a greater extent of surgical resection and absence of contrast enhancement predicted DSS on multivariate analyses. Patients receiving higher doses of RT had higher complication rates.;Our data confirmed the lack of radiation dose response for supratentorial LGG as demonstrated in the previous randomized trials. The radiation dose should not exceed 5520 cGy because dose escalation did not result in an improvement of DSS and it also increased the complication rates.

LRF is also reported to have an oncogenic activity in various human cancers. This study investigated the effect of LRF knockdown on the regulation of glioma growth. LRF short hairpin RNA (shRNA) suppressed the expression of LRF protein in a glioma cell line (GL261-EGFP) compared to the negative control vector-transfected glioma cells. LRF knockdown also reduced glioma cell viability and enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in glioma cells. AKT activation and the expression of various cell cycle-related genes were inhibited following LRF knockdown. The effect on growth and migration is related to dose response results of AKT and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) inhibitors. These data demonstrate that LRF may play a role in glioma progression, suggesting that inhibition of LRF expression using LRF shRNA should be further evaluated as a novel target for the control of glioma.

BMP-2 is also closely associated with various malignant tumors. microRNAs negatively and posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression and function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Herein, we report that miR-656 expression was significantly downregulated in glioma cell lines and tissues. We identified and confirmed that BMP receptor, type 1A (BMPR1A) is a direct target of miR-656. The expression of BMPR1A was negatively correlated with that of miR-656 in human glioma tissues. We further demonstrated that miR-656 suppressed glioma cell proliferation, neurosphere formation, migration and invasion with or without exogenous BMP-2. Engineered knockdown of BMPR1A diminished the antiproliferation effect of miR-656 in vitro. Moreover, the canonical BMP/Smad and non-canonical BMP/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were inhibited by miR-656 overexpression. Several cancer-related signaling molecules, including cyclin B, cyclin D1, matrix metalloproteinase-9, p21 and p27, were also involved in miR-656 function in glioma cells. The tumor-suppressing function of miR-656 was validated using an in vivo intracranial xenograft mouse model. Notably, ectopic expression of miR-656 markedly reduced tumor size and prolonged the survival of mice treated with or without BMP-2. These results elucidate the function of miR-656 in glioma progression and suggest a promising application for glioma treatment. ",

Genetic analysis included a search for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosomes 1p and 19q; amplification of chromosomes 9p and 10q and of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and mouse double-minute (MDM2) genes; and p53 expression.;The median survival was 33.5 months, and the median progression-free survival was 15.8 months. In a univariate analysis, LOH on 1p and 19q was correlated with longer survival, whereas p53 expression, LOH on 9p, LOH on 10q, amplified EGFR, and deleted CDKN2A were correlated with shorter survival. LOH on 1p and 19q were associated with oligodendrogliomas, LOH on 10q was related to EGFR amplification, and LOH on 1p and 19q was mutually exclusive with EGFR amplification and LOH on 10q.

Cathepsin B and uPAR are overexpressed in gliomas and they are postulated to play central roles in glioma metastasis. In this study, efficient downregulation of cathepsin B and uPAR by siRNA treatments significantly reduced glioma cell adhesion to laminin as compared to vitronectin, fibronectin, or collagen I in U251 and 4910 glioma cell lines. Brain glioma tissue array analysis showed high expression of CD151 in clinical samples when compared with normal brain tissue. Cathepsin B and uPAR siRNA treatment led to the downregulation of CD151 and laminin-binding integrins α3 and β1. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that downregulation of cathepsin B and uPAR decreased the interaction of CD151 with uPAR cathepsin B, and α3β1 integrin. Studies on the downstream signaling cascade of uPAR/CD151/α3β1 integrin have shown that phosphorylation of FAK, SRC, paxillin, and expression of adaptor cytoskeletal proteins talin and vinculin were reduced with knockdown of cathepsin B, uPAR, and CD151. Treatment with the bicistronic construct reduced interactions between uPAR and CD151 as well as lowering α3β1 integrin, talin, and vinculin expression levels in pre-established glioma tumors of nude mice. In conclusion, our results show that downregulation of cathepsin B and uPAR alone and in combination inhibit glioma cell adhesion by downregulating CD151 and its associated signaling molecules in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, the results of the present study show that targeting the uPAR-cathepsin B system has possible therapeutic potential.",

In this study, we have examined glioma migration in living brain tissue by using two novel in vivo model systems. Within the brain, glioma cells migrate like nontransformed, neural progenitor cells-extending a prominent leading cytoplasmic process followed by a burst of forward movement by the cell body that requires myosin II. In contrast, on a two-dimensional surface, glioma cells migrate more like fibroblasts, and they do not require myosin II to move. To explain this phenomenon, we studied glioma migration through a series of synthetic membranes with defined pore sizes. Our results demonstrate that the A and B isoforms of myosin II are specifically required when a glioma cell has to squeeze through pores smaller than its nuclear diameter. They support a model in which the neural progenitor-like mode of glioma invasion and the requirement for myosin II represent an adaptation needed to move within the brain, which has a submicrometer effective pore size. Furthermore, the absolute requirement for myosin II in brain invasion underscores the importance of this molecular motor as a potential target for new anti-invasive therapies to treat malignant brain tumors.",

The lowest BrdU LI was seen in pilocytic and gemistocytic astrocytomas followed by astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastoma multiforme in that order. Mixed oligoastrocytomas followed the pattern of their astrocytic counterparts. Tumors of similar histological type showed different BrdU LI values especially amongst astrocytomas and glioblastomas. A statistically significant difference in the BrdU LI was also noted between the higher TESTAST grades of astrocytomas (T III and IV) versus the lower TESTAST grades (T II). Unlike earlier reports in literature, in the present study the category of BrdU LI of <1 contained no case of anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme (TESTAST grades III and IV). Likewise, the category of BrdU LI >5 contained only anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme (TESTAST grades III and IV). Maximum spread of cases was seen in the BrdU LI category of 1-5, not only in terms of histological types but also TESTAST grades. Thus there appeared to be a positive trend of increasing BrdU LI values both with histological types and increasing TESTAST grades. Further, an interesting observation was that by using a combination of TESTAST grades and BrdU LI, the histologically homogenous glioblastoma group could be further subdivided into 4 categories which showed a trend towards prognostic correlation. Thus, this study though preliminary with number of cases being small in some groups, highlights the possible usefulness of combined histological typing, TESTAST grading and in vivo BrdU LI for prognostication of gliomas especially glioblastoma multiforme.",

Here, we report a case involving a 22-year-old man with a right occipital lobe tumor, which comprised mainly epithelioid tumor cells with a small area of diffusely infiltrating less atypical astrocytoma cells showing a lower cell density. Array comparative genomic hybridization separately performed for each histologically distinct component demonstrated eight shared copy number alterations (CNAs) and three CNAs observed only in epithelioid cells; one of the latter was a homozygous deletion of a tumor suppressor gene, LSAMP, at 3q13.31. BRAF V600E mutation was observed both in epithelioid tumor cells and in diffusely infiltrating less atypical astrocytoma cells. Our findings suggest that the regional loss of LSAMP led to the aggressive nature of epithelioid cells in the present case of epithelioid glioblastoma. ",

Documentation of their genetic identity has become a requirement for scientific journals and grant applications to exclude cross-contamination and misidentification that lead to misinterpretation of results. Here, we report the standard 16 marker short tandem repeat (STR) DNA fingerprints for a panel of 39 widely used glioma cell lines as reference. Comparison of the fingerprints among themselves and with the large DSMZ database comprising 9 marker STRs for 2278 cell lines uncovered 3 misidentified cell lines and confirmed previously known cross-contaminations. Furthermore, 2 glioma cell lines exhibited identity scores of 0.8, which is proposed as the cutoff for detecting cross-contamination. Additional characteristics, comprising lack of a B-raf mutation in one line and a similarity score of 1 with the original tumor tissue in the other, excluded a cross-contamination. Subsequent simulation procedures suggested that, when using DNA fingerprints comprising only 9 STR markers, the commonly used similarity score of 0.8 is not sufficiently stringent to unambiguously differentiate the origin. DNA fingerprints are confounded by frequent genetic alterations in cancer cell lines, particularly loss of heterozygosity, that reduce the informativeness of STR markers and, thereby, the overall power for distinction. The similarity score depends on the number of markers measured; thus, more markers or additional cell line characteristics, such as information on specific mutations, may be necessary to clarify the origin.",

Additionally, recent studies have demonstrated the existence             of brain glioma stem cells (BGSCs) which are tumorigenic, self-renewable and dominate             the biological behavior of gliomas. Currently BGSCs are committed as a new target             of glioma therapies. However, few studies have focused on the expression of Bcl-2             in BGSCs. We performed a series of experiments to culture BGSCs from eight clinical             specimens, followed by real-time RT-PCR and immunoassays to compare the expression             levels of Bcl-2 in BGSCs and their corresponding primary glioma cells (PGCs).             The results showed that Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression levels are higher in             BGSCs compared to their counterparts, and the expression levels are related to             glioma malignancies. As an anti-apoptotic gene, Bcl-2 assigns immortality characteristics             to cells, which coincide with the pivotal biological feature of BGSCs. The experimental             results indicated that BGSCs would evade apoptosis for higher Bcl-2 expression,             and may interpret the drug resistance of glioma to cytotoxic drugs and other pro-apoptotic             agents.

Analyses of 16 human glioma lines for the expression of chemokine receptors belonging to the CXCR and CCR series revealed low to negligible levels of all receptors, with the exception of CXCR4 that was expressed by 13 of 16 lines. All six resected human glioma specimens showed similarly high CXCR4 expression. The CXCR4 on glioma lines is a signaling receptor in that its agonist, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1; CXCL12), produced rapid phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Furthermore, SDF-1 induced the phosphorylation of Akt (protein kinase B), a kinase associated with survival, and prevented the apoptosis of glioma cells when serum was withdrawn from the culture medium. SDF-1 also mediated glioma chemotaxis, in accordance with this better known role of chemokines. We conclude that glioma cells express a predominant chemokine receptor, CXCR4, and that this functions to regulate survival in part through activating pathways such as Akt.",

In the present study, HLA antigen frequencies of 65 adult Caucasian patients with low-grade, anaplastic, or malignant astrocytic glioma (WHO grades II-IV) were compared with 157 racially similar, asymptomatic control individuals. Both standard serologic and PCR techniques for HLA typing were employed for all patients and controls. Our results suggest a positive association between single HLA antigens and presence of symptomatic cerebral glioma. Compared with the control population, patients positive for HLA-A*25 had a 3.0-fold increased risk of glioma (p = 0.04), patients positive for HLA-B*27, a 2.7-fold risk (p = 0.03), and patients positive for HLA-DRB1*15, a 2.2-fold risk (p = 0.03), whereas HLA-DRB1*07 was associated with a 0.4-fold decreased risk of glioma (p = 0.02). Occurrence rate of some HLA antigen combinations and estimated haplotypes was also different in glioma patients. Thus, HLA-DRB1*15:DRB5*(51) occurrence in combination with HLA-DRB1*11 was associated with a 13.4-fold increased risk of glioma (p = 0.001), and the incidence of HLA-Cw*6:DRB1*07 with a 0.2-fold decreased risk of glioma (p = 0.03).

We further showed that IL-8 mRNA expression in GBM8401 cells increased dramatically, by 2(8)-2(10)-fold, after being cocultured with macrophages. This increase could also be induced by macrophage-conditioned medium, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta, and could be suppressed by anti-inflammatory agents including pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, pentoxifylline, or dexamethasone.

A serum-free chemically defined medium, MCDB 105, was employed for all studies. Two established human malignant glioma cell lines (T98G and U138), two rat glioma lines (9L and C6), and two low-passage human glioma lines (obtained from surgical specimens) were studied. With the exception of the C6 line, all tumors responded in a dose-dependent fashion to nanomolar concentrations of TPA with a median effective dose that varied from 0.5 ng/ml for the U138 glioma to 1 ng/ml for the T98G glioma. At optimal concentrations (5 to 10 ng/ml), TPA produced a two- to five-fold increase in the rate of DNA synthesis (p less than 0.05) as assessed by incorporation of 3H-thymidine. However, TPA had no additive effect on the mitogenic response produced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Inhibition of PKC using the antibiotic polymyxin B (20 micrograms/ml) abolished the TPA-induced mitogenic response in the five responsive lines tested. In two tumors (U138 and 9L), polymyxin B also eliminated EGF-, PDGF-, and serum-induced DNA synthesis as well as abolishing baseline DNA synthesis. These cells remained viable, however, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion; after removal of polymyxin B from the medium, they were able to resume DNA synthesis in response to TPA and serum. In the three other tumors (T98G and the two low-passage human glioma lines), growth factor-induced and serum-induced DNA synthesis were inhibited by approximately 25% to 85%. It is concluded that PKC-mediated pathways affect DNA synthesis in the human malignant glial tumors studied. The response of the glioma cells to TPA is similar to the responses seen in fetal astrocytes, but differs significantly from those reported for normal adult glial cultures. Because the response of the 9L glioma to TPA is similar to the responses seen in the human tumors, the 9L rat glioma model may prove useful for examining the role of PKC-mediated pathways in controlling glioma growth in vivo.",

We studied 20 cases of pediatric oligodendroglioma by SNP array (median age 9 years, range 1-19; 15 grade II and 5 grade III). Cytogenetic abnormalities were present in 8 (53%) grade II and all five anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Most changes were in the form of deletion and copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH). The most common abnormality was 1p deletion (n = 5). Whole arm 1p19q co-deletion was present in three cases from adolescent patients and 9p loss in 3, including one low-grade oligodendroglioma with CDKN2A homozygous deletion. Common losses were largely limited to the anaplastic subset (n = 5) and included 3q29 (n = 3), 11p (n = 3), 17q (n = 3), 4q (n = 2), 6p (n = 2), 13q (n = 2), 14q (n = 2), 17p (n = 2) and whole Ch 18 loss (n = 2). Gains were non-recurrent except for whole Ch 7 (n = 2) and gain on 12q (n = 2) including the MDM2 locus. Possible germ line LOH (or uniparental disomy) was present in seven cases (35%), with one focal abnormality (22q13.1-13.2) in two. BRAF-KIAA1549 fusions and BRAF p.V600E mutations were absent (n = 13 and 8). In summary, cytogenetic alterations in pediatric oligodendrogliomas are characterized mostly by genomic losses, particularly in anaplastic tumors.",

To establish the role of PDGF-B in glioma angiogenesis, we overexpressed PDGF-B in U87MG glioma cells. Although PDGF-B stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF-Rbeta in U87MG cells, treatment with recombinant PDGF-B or overexpression of PDGF-B in U87MG cells had no effect on their proliferation. However, an increase of secreted PDGF-B in conditioned media of U87MG/PDGF-B cells promoted migration of endothelial cells expressing PDGF-R beta, whereas conditioned media from U87MG cells did not increase the cell migration. In mice, overexpression of PDGF-B in U87MG cells enhanced intracranial glioma formation by stimulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in neovessels and by attracting vessel-associated pericytes. When PDGF-B and VEGF were overexpressed simultaneously by U87MG tumors, there was a marked increase of capillary-associated pericytes as seen in U87MG/VEGF(165)/PDGF-B gliomas. As a result of pericyte recruitment, vessels induced by VEGF in tumor vicinity migrated into the central regions of these tumors. These data suggest that PDGF-B is a paracrine factor in U87MG gliomas, and that PDGF-B enhances glioma angiogenesis, at least in part, by stimulating VEGF expression in tumor endothelia and by recruiting pericytes to neovessels.",

Glioma type 1 (2 of 12) showed constitutive expression of all class II molecules that might be mediated by activation of B cell-specific CIITA promoter III. Glioma type 2 represented the major phenotype (66.7 %) of malignant glioma cell lines, and MHC class II expression was induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in this phenotype. Analysis of glioma tissue samples revealed that CIITA promoter IV was detected in 9 of 11 patients (81.8%); however, promoter III was only in two (18.2%). Moreover, cultured glioma cells obtained from a fresh tumor sample upregulated expression of CIITA and class II molecules in the presence of IFN-gamma, strongly suggesting that glioma type 2 might be predominant in glioma tissues. Glioma type 3 (2 of 12) showed CIITA transcripts but loss of MHC class II expression even in the presence of IFN-gamma. In addition, we determined that the constitutive MHC class II expression in the glioma cell lines (type 1) was the result of transcriptional activation of the CIITA gene. This phenomenon was mediated by global histone acetylation over 6 kb upstream from the transcriptional start site of CIITA promoter III. Moreover, stable transfection of CIITA promoter IV as well as promoter III into MHC class II inducible cell lines restored the constitutive expression of all class II molecules. These studies lay the foundation to understand the molecular basis for the expression of class II molecules in gliomas.",

The differential expression of methyltransferase G9a, histone H3K9me2 and histone H3K9me1 in in human brain glioma and adjacent tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, a growth curve of U251 cells following treatment with BIX‑01294 was determined using the MTT assay. In addition, the apoptosis percentage of U251 cells was analyzed by TUNEL assay and the expression levels of apoptosis‑associated proteins, including B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2), Bcl‑2‑associated X protein (Bax), caspase‑9 and caspase‑3, and the acetylation of histones, including H3K27me1, H3K27me2 and H3 in U251 were analyzed by western blot following BIX‑01294 treatment.

In the present study, we evaluated the in vivo antitumor effect of CKD-602 in a mouse glioma model. Nude mice with established U87MG glioma were treated with a dose of CKD-602 of 0mg/kg (control group, injection with saline only; n=5), 40 mg/kg (group A) or 60 mg/kg (group B).

Mean tumor volume in each group was: control, 145.35 mm(3); group A, 76.51 mm(3); group B, 73.99 mm(3)). Tumor volume was significantly smaller in both groups A and B compared with the control group (group A, p<0.01; group B, p<0.05).

Therefore, disruption of PDGF ligand/receptor complex represents a promising strategy for the treatment of malignant gliomas. However, the mechanisms of the antitumour effect exerted by the inhibition of PDGF-mediated cell growth remain unclear. In the present study, using anti-PDGF neutralising antibody, we investigated the effect of the inhibition of PDGF signalling on malignant glioma U87-MG, D54, and T98G cells with high levels of PDGF-A and -B. As a control, normal fibroblast MRC5 cells expressing low levels of PDGF-A and -B were used. Treatment with anti-PDGF neutralising antibody did not affect the expressions of PDGF-A, PDGF-B, and Akt, but suppressed the level of phosphorylated Akt in tumour cells, indicating the inhibition of PDGF signalling. The cell viability of all malignant glioma cells tested in this study was significantly inhibited in a time-dependent manner following the treatment compared to that of fibroblast cells (P<0.02 to <0.05). The antitumour effect of anti-PDGF antibody was suppressed by the activation of Akt and enhanced by the downregulation of Akt. Interestingly, the inhibition of PDGF signalling induced the development of acidic vesicular organelles and the autophagosome membrane association of the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3, which are characteristic of autophagy, in malignant glioma cells, while apoptotic cell death was not observed. Together these findings imply a new concept of autophagy for PDGF autocrine inhibition in malignant gliomas.",

The design of neutral MP-MUS involved the use of a seeker molecule capable of binding to mitochondrial MAO-B, which is up-regulated ≥fourfold in glioma cells. Once the binding occurs, MP-MUS is converted into a positively charged moiety, P(+) -MUS, which accumulates inside mitochondria at a theoretical maximal value of 1000:1 gradient. The LD50 of MP-MUS against glioma cells is 75 μM, which is two- to threefold more potent than temozolomide, a primary drug for gliomas. Importantly, MP-MUS was found to be selectively toxic toward glioma cells. In the concentration range of 150-180 μM MP-MUS killed 90-95 % of glioma cells, but stimulated the growth of normal human astrocytes.

Aurora kinase inhibitors are in early clinical trials for the treatment of leukemia. We hypothesized that Aurora B inhibition would reduce malignant glioma cell viability and result in impaired tumor growth in vivo. Aurora B expression is greater in cultured malignant glioma U251 cells compared to proliferating normal human astrocytes, and expression is maintained in U251 flank xenografts. Aurora B inhibition with AZD1152-HQPA blocked cell division in four different p53-mutant glioma cell lines (U251, T98G, U373, and U118). AZD1152-HQPA also inhibited Aurora C activation loop threonine autophosphorylation at the effective antiproliferative concentrations in vitro. Reduction in cell viability of U251 (p53(R273H)) cells was secondary to cytokinesis blockade and apoptosis induction following endoreplication. AZD1152-HQPA inhibited the growth of U251 tumor xenografts and resulted in an increase in tumor cell apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo.

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which thallium acetate induces cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis in cultured LC6 glioma cells. Exposure of C6 glioma cells to thallium acetate decreased cell viability as demonstrated by the MTT assay. Incubation of thallium acetate arrested cell cycle progression at the G2/M phase and caused cellular apoptosis at 300 microM as determined by trypan blue exclusion and flow cytometric analysis. The G2/M arrest was associated with a decrease in expression of CDK2 protein and an upregulation of p53 and the CDK inhibitor p21(Cip1), but not p27(Kip1). Thallium acetate did not alter the protein levels of cyclin A and B; cyclin D1, D2, and D3; and CDK4 expression in C6 glioma cells. Incubation of C6 glioma cells with thallium acetate upregulated the expression of proapoptotic proteins Bad and Apaf and downregulated the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. In conclusion, these data suggest that thallium acetate inhibits cell cycle progression at G2/M phase by suppressing CDK activity through the p53-mediated induction of the CDK inhibitor p21(Cip1). Impairment of cell cycle progression may trigger the activation of a mitochondrial pathway and shifts the balance in the Bcl-2 family toward the proapoptotic members, promoting the formation of the apoptosome and, consequently, apoptosis.",

Here, expression profiles of ephrin-B family members were determined in four glioma cell lines and in invading glioblastoma cells collected by laser capture microdissection. Ephrin-B3 mRNA was up-regulated in migrating cells of four of four glioma cell lines (1.3- to 1.7-fold) and in invading tumor cells of eight of eight biopsy specimens (1.2- to 10.0-fold). Forced expression of ephrin-B3 in low expressor cell lines (U87, T98G) stimulated cell migration and invasion in vitro and ex vivo, concomitant with tyrosine phosphorylation of ephrin-B3. In high expressor cell lines (U251, SNB19), ephrin-B3 colocalized with Rac1 to lamellipodia of motile wild-type cells. Cells transfected with ephrin-B3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) showed significant morphologic change and decreased invasion in vitro and ex vivo. Depletion of endogenous ephrin-B3 expression abrogated the increase of migration and invasion induced by EphB2/Fc, indicating increased invasion is dependent on ephrin-B3 activation. Furthermore, using a Rac1-GTP pull-down assay, we showed that ephrin-B3 is associated with Rac1 activation. Reduction of Rac1 by siRNA negated the increased invasion by addition of EphB2/Fc. In human glioma specimens, ephrin-B3 expression and phosphorylation correlated with increasing tumor grade. Immunohistochemistry revealed robust staining for phosphorylated ephrin-B and ephrin-B3 in invading glioblastoma cells. These data show that ephrin-B3 expression and signaling through Rac1 are critically important to glioma invasion.",

        "Doc_abstract":"It is well recognized that malignant gliomas escape an immune response by hiding behind the blood-brain barrier and by producing proteins that suppress systemic immunity. However, if gliomas can be made to be more immunogenic or if a tumor vaccine can be produced, then access to all tumor cells including those that infiltrate into the brain can be achieved through the patient's immune response. Several strategies have been investigated for immunotherapy. Laboratory studies and animal models have shown that these immune cells will attack the tumor cell, reduce the size of implanted tumors, and that the immune memory is sufficient to suppress tumor growth when the animal is rechallenges with a tumor implant. Since the development of hybridoma technology, monoclonal antibodies against human cancer cells have been produced and antigens have been identified. Hagiwara reported the production of a human monoclonal antibody, CLN-IgG, made by fusing UC 729-6, human lymphoblastoid B-cell line, with lymphocytes obtained from a patient with the cervical carcinoma. It has been reported that CLN-IgG recognized the antigen expressed in various histological types of human cancers including malignant gliomas. The effect of human monoclonal antibody(CLN-IgG) on malignant brain tumors was evaluated in patients with malignant glioma. Early phase II study was concluded that this specific immunotherapy with CLN-IgG is safe and effective therapy in patients with malignant glioma. We treated 10 cases of malignant gliomas with CLN-IgG. All patients had received radiotherapy and chemotherapy before this immunotherapy using the human monoclonal antibody. The human monoclonal antibody(CLN-IgG) was administered intravenously once or twice/week during 24 weeks. Six cases of glioblastoma, 1 medulloblastoma and 3 cases of potine glioma histologically unverified, were treated. Five cases of 6 glioblastomas died 4 to 12 months after this treatment, 3 cases of pontine glioma showed good responses, 2 cases showed marked decrease of tumor size and 1 case showed no regrowth of tumor on MRI imaging. For the above reasons, Human monoclonal antibody(CLN-IgG) might be useful as an immunotherapy of malignant gliomas.",

Here, we examine the cytotoxic effects of soluble components secreted from microglia culture on glioma cells. Microglia conditioned culture medium (MCM) actively stimulated apoptotic death of glioma cells, and the effects of MCM prepared from LPS- or IFN-gamma-activated microglia were more pronounced. The cytotoxic effects were glioma-specific in that primary cultured rat astrocytes were not affected by MCM. A donor of peroxynitrite induced glioma-specific cell death. In addition, NO synthase inhibitor suppressed glioma cell death induced by activated MCM, indicating that NO is one of the key molecules responsible for glioma cytotoxicity mediated by activated MCM. However, since unstimulated resting microglia produces low or very limited level of NO, MCM may contain other critical molecule(s) that induce glioma apoptosis. To identify the proteins secreted in MCM, proteomic analysis was performed on control or activated medium. Among over 200 protein spots detected by Coomassie blue staining, we identified 26 constitutive and 28 LPS- or IFN-gamma-regulated MCM proteins. Several cathepsin proteases were markedly expressed, which were reduced upon activation. In particular, suppression of cathepsin B by the chemical inhibitors significantly reversed MCM-induced glioma cell death, implying a critical role of this protease in cytotoxicity. Our findings provide evidence on the functional implications of specific microglial-secreted proteins in glioma cytotoxicity, as well as a basis to develop a proteomic databank of both basal and activation-related proteins in microglia.",

Sustained ERK pathway activity is commonly observed in human malignancies; however, the mechanisms by which the pathway is protected from phosphatase-mediated inactivation in the tumor tissue remain obscure. Here, we show that methylesterase PME-1-mediated inhibition of the protein phosphatase 2A promotes basal ERK pathway activity and is required for efficient growth factor response. Mechanistically, PME-1 is shown to support ERK pathway signaling upstream of Raf, but downstream of growth factor receptors and protein kinase C. In malignant gliomas, PME-1 expression levels correlate with both ERK activity and cell proliferation in vivo. Moreover, PME-1 expression significantly correlates with disease progression in human astrocytic gliomas (n=222). Together, these observations identify PME-1 expression as one mechanism by which ERK pathway activity is maintained in cancer cells and suggest an important functional role for PME-1 in the disease progression of human astrocytic gliomas.",

However, the molecular basis of its action is still not clear. Besides endothelial cells, Flt-1 is also expressed by other different cell types, including myeloid hematopoeitic cells (monocytes and macrophages). To examine the functions of Flt-1 expressed by bone marrow-derived myeloid cells in supporting tumor growth and angiogenesis, Flt-1 tyrosine kinase-deficient (Flt-1 TK-/-) bone marrow cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated syngeneic recipients. After hematopoietic reconstitution, we orthotopically implanted syngeneic wild-type glioma cells or glioma cells overexpressing either VEGF(164) or PlGF-2. Loss of Flt-1 signaling in bone marrow-derived myeloid cells led to a significant decrease in tumor volume and vascularization in gliomas. VEGF but not PlGF overexpressed by glioma cells restored the tumor growth rate in Flt-1 TK-/- bone marrow chimera. VEGF and PlGF overexpression by tumor cells induced an accumulation of bone marrow-derived myeloid cells into tumor tissue. This infiltration was decreased in tumors grown in Flt-1 TK-/- bone marrow chimeras. When investigating chemokines and growth factors involved in myeloid cell recruitment, we determined elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 levels in VEGF- and PlGF-overexpressing tumors.

Here we confirm and extend the profile of molecular genetic findings in a MG-PNET involving the left frontal lobe of a 12-year-old male. Histologically, the PNET-like component showed morphological features akin to anaplastic medulloblastoma highlighted by widespread immunoreactivity for βIII-tubulin (TUBB3) and nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein, and to a lesser degree, Neu-N, synaptophysin, and CD99, whereas the gliomatous component was demarcated by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) labeling. Immunohistochemical labeling with an anti-H3K27M mutant-specific antibody was not detectable in either gliomatous and/or PNET-like areas. Interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) study on touch preparations from frozen tumor and formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded histological sections showed amplification of MYC in both PNET-like and gliomatous areas. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray analysis revealed that the tumor carried gains of multiple chromosomes and chromosome arms, losses of multiple chromosomes and chromosome arms, gains of multiple chromosomal segments (not limited to amplification of chromosomal segments 4q12 including PDGFRA, and 8q24.21 including MYC), and a hitherto unreported chromothripsis-like abnormality on chromosome 8. No mutations were identified for IDH1, IDH2, or BRAF genes by sequence analysis. The molecular genetic findings support the presence of a CNS-PNET as an integral part of the tumor coupled with overlapping genetic alterations found in both adult and pediatric high-grade gliomas/glioblastoma.

More than 200 gene expression alterations were detected from glioblastomas, whereas relatively few changes were seen in grade II and grade III tumors. The most distinct progression-related expression change was the up-regulation of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) gene. Second, a high-density tissue microarray of 418 brain tumors was constructed and used for clinical validation of gene expression changes. Strong expression of IGFBP2 was associated with progression and poor patient survival in diffuse astrocytomas (P < 0.0001). Third, comparisons of the data between (a) multiple spots retrieved from one predefined tumor region (IGFBP2 and vimentin immunohistochemistry, 20 tumors) or between (b) standard slides and arrayed tissues (p53 immunohistochemistry, 42 tumors) revealed very little variation.

In cultured 9L gliosarcoma cells, AQP1 expression was induced by dexamethasone, platelet-derived growth factor, NaCl, hypoxia, D-glucose (but not L-glucose), and fructose.

        "Doc_abstract":"Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to localize to gliomas and deliver therapeutic agents. However, the clinical translation of MSCs remains poorly defined because previous studies relied on glioma models with uncertain relevance to human disease, typically xenograft models in immunocompromised mice. To address this shortcoming, we used the RCAS/Ntv-a system, in which endogenous gliomas that recapitulate the tumor and stromal features of human gliomas develop in immunocompetent mice. MSCs were harvested from bone marrow of Ntv-a mice and injected into the carotid artery of Ntv-a mice previously inoculated with RCAS-PDGF-B and RCAS-IGFBP2 to induce malignant gliomas (n = 9). MSCs were labeled with luciferase for in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI). After intra-arterial injection, BLI revealed MSCs in the right frontal lobe in seven of nine mice. At necropsy, gliomas were detected within the right frontal lobe in all these mice, correlating with the location of the MSCs. In the two mice without MSCs based on BLI, no tumor was found, indicating that MSC localization was tumor specific. In another cohort of mice (n = 9), MSCs were labeled with SP-DiI, a fluorescent vital dye. After intra-arterial injection, fluorescence microscopy revealed SP-DiI-labeled MSCs throughout tumors 1 to 7 days after injection but not in nontumoral areas of the brain. MSCs injected intravenously did not localize to tumors (n = 12). We conclude that syngeneic MSCs are capable of homing to endogenous gliomas in immunocompetent mice. These findings support the use of MSCs as tumor-specific delivery vehicles for treating gliomas.",

The decreased interaction of hexokinase 2 with mitochondria in the             treated cells indicated the inhibition of glycolysis activation. Overexpression             of Akt reversed the pMU- and pMC-mediated OXPHOS to glycolysis switch. The OXPHOS             un-coupler oligomycin A altered the expression levels of the Bcl-2 family of proteins;             treatment with pMU or pMC reversed this effect and induced mitochondrial outer             membrane permeabilization. In addition, our results show changes in mitochondrial             pore transition to release cytochrome c due to changes in the VDAC-Bcl-XL and             BAX-BAK interaction with pMU and pMC treatments. Taken together, our results suggest             that pMU and pMC treatments switch glioma cells from the glycolytic to the OXPHOS             pathway through an inhibitory effect on Akt, ROS induction and an increase of             cytosolic cytochrome c accumulation.

Replicating oncolytic viruses have shown great promise, among them attenuated measles viruses of the Edmonston B strain (MV-Edm). However, host immune response and the infiltrative nature of gliomas limit their efficacy. We show that human blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs), readily expandable from peripheral blood, are easily infected by MV-Edm and allow replication of MV-Edm while surviving long enough after infection to serve as vehicles for MV-Edm (BOEC/MV-Edm). After intravenous and peritumoral injection, BOEC/MV-Edm deliver the viruses selectively to irradiated orthotopic U87 gliomas in mice. At the tumor, MV-Edm produced by the BOECs infect glioma cells. Subsequent spread from tumor cell to tumor cell leads to focal infection and cytopathic effects that decrease tumor size and, in the case of peritumoral injection, prolong survival of mice. Since MV-Edm within BOECs are not readily neutralized and because BOEC/MV-Edm search and destroy glioma cells, BOEC/MV-Edm constitute a promising novel approach for glioma therapy.",

Using glioma cDNA microarray analysis, we found that FKBP5 was overexpressed in glioma tumors. This finding was further validated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The roles of FKBP5 in glioma cells were then examined. We found that cell growth was suppressed after FKBP5 expression was inhibited by short interfering RNA transfection and enhanced by FKBP5 overexpression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and DNA binding was enhanced by FKBP5 overexpression. The expression level of I-kappa B alpha and phosphorylated NF-kappaB was regulated by the expression of FKBP5. These data suggest that FKBP5 is involved in NF-kappaB pathway activation in glioma cells. In addition, FKBP5 overexpression in rapamycin-sensitive U87 cells blocked the cells' response to rapamycin treatment, whereas rapamycin-resistant glioma cells, both PTEN-positive and -negative, were synergistically sensitive to rapamycin after FKBP5 was knocked down, suggesting that the FKBP5 regulates glioma cell response to rapamycin treatment.

Here, we investigate the function of miR-218 in apoptosis and tumor growth of glioma cells.;The expression of miR-218 was detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. The effects of miR-218 on glioma cell proliferation and tumorigenicity were investigated by in vitro clonogenicity and in vivo xenograft assay.

We developed a five B cell-associated gene signature for prognosis of high grade glioma patients, which is independent of clinicopathological and genetic features. The signature identified high risk patients suitable for chemoradiotherapy, whereas low risk patients should rule out chemotherapy with radiotherapy only. We found that tumors of TCGA Mesenchymal subtype and wild type IDH1 were preferentially stratified to the high risk group, which bore strong immunosuppressive microenvironment, while tumors of TCGA Proneural subtype and mutated IDH1 were significantly accumulated to the low risk group, which exhibited less immunosuppressive state.

Since then, it has been shown very convincingly that viruses can directly cause several human cancers by various mechanisms. Epidemiological data imply that viruses are the second most important risk factor for cancer development in humans, exceeded only by tobacco consumption. Although the ability of certain viruses (hepatitis B and C, human papillomavirus, etc) to cause cancer has been time tested and proven scientifically, there are several other potential viral candidates whose role in oncogenesis is more controversial. One such controversial scenario involves the role of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in malignant gliomas, the most common form of primary brain tumour. CMV first attracted attention about a decade ago when CMV gene products were found in glioma tissue but not in normal brain. Since this initial observation, several different groups have shown an oncomodulatory effect of CMV; however, direct association between CMV infection and incidence of glioma is lacking. In this review, we will evaluate the evidence, both preclinical and clinical, regarding the possible role of CMV in gliomagenesis and maintenance. We will also critically evaluate the rationale for using antiviral drugs in the treatment of patients with glioma. ",

In neurinomas a greater amount of acid mucopolysaccharides can be shown not only in the collagen fibers but also in tumor areas of the Antoni-B-type.

TCTP can promote the growth and suppress apoptosis of tumor cels. However, few studies have reported the effects of TCTP in gliomas. In the present study, a glioma cell line was established, which was stably transfected with TCTP short hairpin ribonucleic acid (shRNA), to investigate the impact of downregulated expression of TCTP on the proliferation, apoptosis and invasion of glioma cells. Western blot and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated that TCTP shRNA effectively reduced the expression of TCTP in the U251 glioma cell line. MTT and colony formation assays revealed that downregulated expression of TCTP significantly inhibited glioma cell proliferation. Cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry revealed that the cells in the pRNA‑H1.1‑TCTP group were arrested in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Western blot analysis detected downregulated expression levels of cyclins, including Cyclin D1, Cyclin E and Cyclin B. Annexin V‑fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide and Hoechst staining demonstrated that the apoptotic rate of the cells in the pRNA‑H1.1‑TCTP group was significantly higher than that of the cells in the pRNA‑H1.1‑control group, with upregulated expression levels of B-cell-associated X protein and cleaved‑caspase‑3 and downregulated expression of B-cell lmyphoma-2 in the apoptotic process. Wound healing and Transwell assays revealed that downregulated expression of TCTP significantly inhibited the migration and invasiveness of the glioma cells; and the expression levels and activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑2 and MMP‑9 were also significantly affected. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that downregulated expression of TCTP significantly inhibited proliferation and invasion, and induced apoptosis in the glioma cells. These results suggested that TCTP may be important in glioma development and metastasis. Therefore, TCTP is expected to become an effective target for glioma gene therapy.",

We developed a novel methodology by utilizing multiphoton laser scanning microscopy (MPLSM) to image the movement of glioma cells deep within the normal brain of live mice in real time. This allowed us to track the invasion of individual RFP-expressing GL261 cells in relation to perfused vasculature or GFP-labeled endothelial cells repetitively over days, up to a depth of 0.5 mm. Glioma cells moved faster and more efficiently when the abluminal site of a blood vessel was utilized for invasion. Cells that invaded perivascularly were frequently found next to (a) multiple capillary structures where microvessels run parallel to each other, (b) capillary loops or glomeruloid-like bodies, and (c) dilated capillaries. Dynamic MPLSM for more than 48 h revealed that single invasive glioma cells induced intussusceptive microvascular growth and capillary loop formation, specifically at the microvascular site with which they had contact. As the main tumor grew by cooption of existing brain vessels, these peritumoral vascular changes may create a beneficial environment for glioma growth.

Migration and invasiveness of the engineered cells were assessed using wound healing assay, Transwell migration assay, Transwell matrix penetration assay and 3-D spheroid invasion assay. MMP-9 expression and activity were measured using real-time PCR, ELISA and the gelatin zymography methods. Expression of NF-kappaB target genes was quantified using real-time PCR. NF-kappaB transcriptional activity was assessed using an NF-kappaB luciferase reporter system. Expression of Bmi-1 and MMP-9 in clinical specimens was analyzed using immunohistochemical assay.;Ectopic overexpression of Bmi-1 dramatically increased, whereas knockdown of endogenous Bmi-1 reduced, the invasiveness and migration of glioma cells. NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and MMP-9 expression and activity were significantly increased in Bmi-1-overexpressing but reduced in Bmi-1-silenced cells. The reporter luciferase activity driven by MMP-9 promoter in Bmi-1-overexpressing cells was dependent on the presence of a functional NF-kappaB binding site, and blockade of NF-kappaB signaling inhibited the upregulation of MMP-9 in Bmi-1 overexpressing cells. Furthermore, expression of Bmi-1 correlated with NF-kappaB nuclear translocation as well as MMP-9 expression in clinical glioma samples.;Bmi-1 may play an important role in the development of aggressive phenotype of glioma via activating the NF-kappaB/MMP-9 pathway and therefore might represent a novel therapeutic target for glioma.",

We measured TM4SF1 expression in tumor tissue from 72 patients with glioma and in eight control brain tissues by means of quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. The survival data including age, sex, Karnofsky performance scores, epilepsy, size of tumor, extent of resection, pathological grade, and TM4SF1 expression were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the multivariate test method (Cox's proportional hazards model).

Kaplan-Meier analysis with the log-rank test indicated that high TM4SF1 expression had a significant negative impact on overall survival (P<0.001). Moreover, multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that TM4SF1 was an independent prognostic marker in glioma patients.

Thus in this study, we performed multiple analysis such as MTT assay, Hoechst 33258 staining, flow cytometry, foci formation, RT-PCR, Western blot, and transfection to explore the selective lethality of PEITC to malignant glioma cells and the underlying mechanisms. We found that PEITC induced a selective apoptosis and suppressed tumorigenicity and migration of malignant glioma cells. Furthermore, we found PEITC significantly induced GSH depletion, ROS production, caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, and miR-135a upregulation in malignant glioma cells but not in normal cells. Moreover, PEITC activated the miR-135a-mitochondria dependent apoptosis pathway as demonstrated by downregulation of STAT6, SMAD5 and Bcl-xl while upregulation of Bax expression and Cytochrome-C release in malignant glioma cell lines but not in the immortalized human normal glial HEB cells. Correspondingly, the above PEITC-induced activation of the ROS-MiR-135a-Mitochondria dependent apoptosis pathways in malignant glioma was attenuated by pre-transfection with miR-135a inhibitor, pre-treatment with multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) inhibitor Sch B, or combination with glutathione (GSH). These results revealed that PEITC selectively induced apoptosis of malignant glioma cells through MRP1-mediated export of GSH to activate ROS-MiR-135a-Mitochondria dependent apoptosis pathway, suggesting a potential application of PEITC for treating glioma.

Recently described genetic aberrations involving this pathway are critical for tumorigenesis. Tandem duplication of 7q34 encodes BRAF and produces several KIAA1549-BRAF novel oncogenic fusions. Activating point mutations of BRAF, such as BRAF (V600E), also lead to pilocytic astrocytoma. Loss of the NF1 gene allows hyperactivation of the oncogene KRAS.

In the present study, we used plasmid constructs to induce the RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated down-regulation of uPAR and cathepsin B in SNB19 human glioma cells. We observed that the simultaneous down-regulation of uPAR and cathepsin B induces the up-regulation of proapoptotic genes and initiates a collapse in mitochondrial Deltapsi.

Nuclear translocation of AIF and Fas ligand translocation to the cell membrane were also observed. Ki67 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein levels decreased, thereby indicating apoptosis. These results suggest the involvement of uPAR-cathepsin B complex on the cell surface and its role in maintaining the viability of SNB19 glioma cells.

However, its expression status, clinical significance and biological functions in glioma remain largely unknown. In the present study, the levels of BCL3 were overexpressed in glioma compared to normal brain tissues. Furthermore, high expression of BCL3 protein was confirmed by immunoblotting in glioma cells as compared with normal human astrocyte cell line. The positive expression of BCL3 was correlated with adverse prognostic features and reduced overall survival rate of glioma patients. BCL3 silencing resulted in prominent decreased proliferation, cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and increased apoptosis in U251 cells. In contrast, BCL3 overexpression in U87 cells remarkably facilitated proliferative ability and cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis. In vivo studies showed that BCL3 knockdown inhibited the tumor growth of U251 cells in a mouse xenograft model. Mechanistically, BCL3 positively regulated the abundance of STAT3, p-STAT3 and the downstream targets of STAT3 pathway including BCL2, MCL-1 and cyclin D1 in glioma cells. Furthermore, a positive correlation between BCL3 and STAT3 expression was observed in glioma specimens. Notably, we confirmed that STAT3 knockdown abolished the oncogenic roles of BCL3 in glioma.

However, the exact function of miR‑34a on glioma progression and underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The present study investigated the function of miR‑34a in U87 human glioma cells by exogenously transfecting cells with an miR‑34a mimic. Overexpression of miR‑34a inhibited proliferation, and induced apoptosis of U87 cells. The current study also demonstrated that B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2) was the target gene of miR‑34a, as demonstrated by luciferase assays. Furthermore, restoring the expression of Bcl‑2 was indicated to partially block the miR‑34a‑induced apoptosis. Thus, data from the present study identified miR‑34a as a tumor suppressor in glioma by, at least partially, targeting Bcl‑2. This may provide future novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for human glioma. ",

Malignant glioma cells secrete thrombospondin-1 which participates in the motility of glioma cells and binds cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan. To clarify the invasion mechanism of tumor cells, expression of the syndecans (syndecan-1, -2, -3, and -4), a major cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan family, was analyzed in malignant gliomas. Involvement of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) on syndecan-1 expression was also investigated. Using reverse transcription-PCR, the authors analyzed the expression of syndecan-1, -2, -3, and -4 in 10 malignant glioma cell lines, 2 glioblastoma specimens, and 2 normal brain specimens. All malignant glioma cell lines and glioblastoma specimens expressed all types of syndecan mRNA, except in one glioma cell line that lacked syndecan-3 expression. On the other hand, normal brain specimens expressed syndecan-2, -3, and -4 mRNA, but did not syndecan-1 mRNA. Syndecan-1 protein was localized in the cell surface of all malignant glioma cell lines by flow cytometry. Various levels of active nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) was detected in all malignant glioma cell lines using immunoblotting. The expression of active NF-kappaB and syndecan-1 increased in U251 glioma cells after tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1beta treatment, which can activate NF-kappaB. The amplification of active NF-kappaB and syndecan-1 by tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1beta was suppressed by an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation (emodin). Emodin also downregulated the expression of syndecan-1 mRNA in U251 cells. These results indicate that malignant glioma cells express all types of syndecans and suggest that NF-kappaB participates in the upregulation of the syndecan-1 expression at the transcriptional level, and increased expression of syndecan-1 could associate with extracellular matrices including thrombospondin-1.",

Depending on the type of cells and their functional interactions, immune cells may play a key role in suppressing the tumor or in providing support for tumor growth, with relevant effects on patient behavior. In recent years, important advances have been achieved in the characterization of immune cell infiltrates in central nervous system (CNS) tumors, but their role in tumorigenesis and patient behavior still remain poorly understood. Overall, these studies have shown significant but variable levels of infiltration of CNS tumors by macrophage/microglial cells (TAM) and to a less extent also lymphocytes (particularly T-cells and NK cells, and less frequently also B-cells). Of note, TAM infiltrate gliomas at moderate numbers where they frequently show an immune suppressive phenotype and functional behavior; in contrast, infiltration by TAM may be very pronounced in meningiomas, particularly in cases that carry isolated monosomy 22, where the immune infiltrates also contain greater numbers of cytotoxic T and NK-cells associated with an enhanced anti-tumoral immune response. In line with this, the presence of regulatory T cells, is usually limited to a small fraction of all meningiomas, while frequently found in gliomas. Despite these differences between gliomas and meningiomas, both tumors show heterogeneous levels of infiltration by immune cells with variable functionality. In this review we summarize current knowledge about tumor-infiltrating immune cells in the two most common types of CNS tumors-gliomas and meningiomas-, as well as the role that such immune cells may play in the tumor microenvironment in controlling and/or promoting tumor development, growth and control.

In the current study, we compare the expression of alpha(v)beta(3) in ependymomas, oligodendrogliomas, pilocytic astrocytomas, medulloblastomas, and vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas). Samples of 5 tumors of each of the 5 tumor types were harvested surgically and frozen. After the pathological diagnosis was confirmed, immunohistochemistry was performed using an anti- alpha(v)beta(3) monoclonal antibody (LM609). The expression of alpha(v)beta(3) was assessed using a 4-tiered (0-3) grading scheme reflecting the percentage of positively staining vessels. All vestibular schwannomas demonstrated strong (grade 3) alpha(v)beta(3) expression. The expression was uniformly prominent in Antoni B regions of the tumors. Of 5 ependymomas, 4 demonstrated uniformly strong alpha(v)beta(3).

        "Doc_abstract":"Despite major advances in the management of malignant gliomas of which glioblastomas represent the ultimate grade of malignancy, they remain characterized by dismal prognoses. Glioblastoma patients have a median survival expectancy of only 14 months on the current standard treatment of surgical resection to the extent feasible, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy plus temozolomide, given concomitantly with and after radiotherapy. Malignant gliomas are associated with such dismal prognoses because glioma cells can actively migrate through the narrow extra-cellular spaces in the brain, often travelling relatively long distances, making them elusive targets for effective surgical management. Clinical and experimental data have demonstrated that invasive malignant glioma cells show a decrease in their proliferation rates and a relative resistance to apoptosis (type I programmed cell death) as compared to the highly cellular centre of the tumor, and this may contribute to their resistance to conventional pro-apoptotic chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Resistance to apoptosis results from changes at the genomic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional level of proteins, protein kinases and their transcriptional factor effectors. The PTEN/ PI3K/Akt/mTOR/NF-kappaB and the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascades play critical roles in the regulation of gene expression and prevention of apoptosis. Components of these pathways are mutated or aberrantly expressed in human cancer, notably glioblastomas. Monoclonal antibodies and low molecular-weight kinase inhibitors of these pathways are the most common classes of agents in targeted cancer treatment. However, most clinical trials of these agents as monotherapies have failed to demonstrate survival benefit. Despite resistance to apoptosis being closely linked to tumorigenesis, tumor cells can still be induced to die by non-apoptotic mechanisms such as necrosis, senescence, autophagy (type II programmed cell death) and mitotic catastrophe. Temozolomide brings significant therapeutic benefits in glioblastoma treatment. Part of temozolomide cytotoxic activity is exerted through pro-autophagic processes and also through the induction of late apoptosis. Autophagy, type II programmed cell death, represents an alternative mechanism to overcome, at least partly, the dramatic resistance of many cancers to pro-apoptotic-related therapies. Another way to potentially overcome apoptosis resistance is to decrease the migration of malignant glioma cells in the brain, which then should restore a level of sensitivity to pro-apoptotic drugs. Recent series of studies have supported the concept that malignant gliomas might be seen as an orchestration of cross-talks between cancer cells, microenvironment, vasculature and cancer stem cells. The present chapter focuses on (i) the major signaling pathways making glioblastomas resistant to apoptosis, (ii) the signaling pathways distinctly activated by pro-autophagic drugs as compared to pro-apoptotic ones, (iii) autophagic cell death as an alternative to combat malignant gliomas, (iv) the major scientific data already obtained by researchers to prove that temozolomide is actually a pro-autophagic and pro-apoptotic drug, (v) the molecular and cellular therapies and local drug delivery which could be used to complement conventional treatments, and a review of some of the currently ongoing clinical trials, (vi) the fact that reducing the levels of malignant glioma cell motility can restore pro-apoptotic drug sensitivity, (vii) the observation that inhibiting the sodium pump activity reduces both glioma cell proliferation and migration, (viii) the brain tumor stem cells as a target to complement conventional treatment.",

Therefore, the targeting of mTOR signaling is considered a promising therapy for malignant gliomas. However, the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effects of a selective mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, on malignant glioma cells are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was thus to elucidate how rapamycin exerts its cytotoxic effects on malignant glioma cells. We showed that rapamycin induced autophagy but not apoptosis in rapamycin-sensitive malignant glioma U87-MG and T98G cells by inhibiting the function of mTOR. In contrast, in rapamycin-resistant U373-MG cells, the inhibitory effect of rapamycin was minor, although the phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase, a molecule downstream of mTOR, was remarkably inhibited. Interestingly, a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, and an Akt inhibitor, UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine), both synergistically sensitized U87-MG and T98G cells as well as U373-MG cells to rapamycin by stimulating the induction of autophagy. Enforced expression of active Akt in tumor cells suppressed the combined effects of LY294002 or UCN-01, whereas dominant-negative Akt expression was sufficient to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to rapamycin. These results indicate that rapamycin exerts its antitumor effect on malignant glioma cells by inducing autophagy and suggest that in malignant glioma cells a disruption of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway could greatly enhance the effectiveness of mTOR inhibitors.",

The aim of this study was to assess the ability of different interleukins (IL), IL-2, IL-12 and IL-21, produced by transduced glioma cells to activate an immune response and trigger intracranial tumor rejection. Such experiments were performed by the use of a slow-growing clone of GL261 (GL D2-60) that was used as orthotopic glioma model. Using GL D2-60-transduced cells, all cytokines elicited an immune response against the tumor. Most notably 100% of the animals receiving a primary implant of IL-21-transduced cells rejected the implant, and 76% of these animals survived to a subsequent rechallenge with GL261 parental cells, while the other transduced cytokine genes were not as effective. Rejection responses were also obtained by admixing wild-type tumor cells with IL-21-producing GL D2-60 cells, indicating a local bystander effect of IL-21. More importantly, IL-21-secreting GL D2-60 cells or 1 microg of rIL-21 protein stereotactically injected into established GL D2-60 tumors were able to trigger glioblastoma rejection in 90 and 77% of mice, respectively. Again most of these mice survived to GL261 rechallenge. Immune mice showed antibody responses to glioma antigens, predominantly involving IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes, which mediated complement- or cell-dependent glioma cell lysis. Antibody responses were crucial for glioma immunotherapy by IL-21-secreting GL D2-60 cells, as immunotherapy was uneffective in syngeneic microMT B-cell-deficient mice.

        "Doc_abstract":"Capsaicin, a pungent ingredient of red chili peppers, has been reported to possess antitumor activities. Here, we show that subtoxic doses of capsaicin effectively sensitize multiple malignant glioma cell lines to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis. Although TRAIL alone mediated partial proteolytic processing of procaspase-3 in glioma cells, cotreatment with capsaicin and TRAIL efficiently restored complete activation of caspases. We found that treatment of various gliomas with capsaicin significantly upregulated DR5, a death receptor of TRAIL, and downregulated the caspase inhibitor survivin. The induction of DR5 was mediated by CHOP/GADD153. The reduction in survivin protein level was associated with downregulation of cyclin B and Cdc2 expression, suggesting that inhibition of Cdc2 activity might contribute to capsaicin-induced survivin downregulation. Taken together, these results indicate that the activity of capsaicin toward DR5 and survivin contributes to the amplification of caspase cascades, thereby restoring TRAIL sensitivity in malignant glioma cells. Interestingly, normal astrocytes were resistant to combined treatment with capsaicin and TRAIL. Neither capsaicin-induced DR5 upregulation/survivin downregulation nor the partial processing of procaspase-3 by TRAIL was induced in astrocytes. Thus, a combined regimen using capsaicin and TRAIL may provide a safe and effective strategy for treating malignant gliomas.",

The anti-apoptotic b cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) gene is associated with treatment resistance, and is transactivated by the paired box transcription factor 8 (PAX8). In earlier studies, we demonstrated that increased PAX8 expression in glioma cell lines was associated with the expression of telomerase. In this current study, we more extensively explored a role for PAX8 in gliomagenesis.;PAX8 expression was measured in 156 gliomas including telomerase-negative tumours, those with the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism or with a non-defined telomere maintenance mechanism (NDTMM), using immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR. We also tested the affect of PAX8 knockdown using siRNA in cell lines on cell survival and BCL2 expression.;Seventy-two percent of glioblastomas were PAX8-positive (80% telomerase, 73% NDTMM, and 44% ALT). The majority of the low-grade gliomas and normal brain cells were PAX8-negative. The suppression of PAX8 was associated with a reduction in both cell growth and BCL2, suggesting that a reduction in PAX8 expression would sensitise tumours to cell death.;PAX8 is increased in the majority of glioblastomas and promoted cell survival.

Proteases such as MMP9, cathepsin B and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) are over expressed in gliomas and contribute to enhanced cancer cell proliferation. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair mechanism plays a major role in double strand break (DSB) repair in mammalian cells.;Here we show that silencing MMP9 in combination with uPAR/cathepsin B effects NHEJ repair machinery. Expression of DNA PKcs and Ku70/80 at both mRNA and protein levels in MMP9-uPAR (pMU) and MMP9-cathepsin B (pMC) shRNA-treated glioma xenograft cells were reduced. FACS analysis showed an increase in apoptotic peak and proliferation assays revealed a significant reduction in the cell population in pMU- and pMC-treated cells compared to untreated cells. We hypothesized that reduced NHEJ repair led to DSBs accumulation in pMU- and pMC-treated cells, thereby initiating cell death. This hypothesis was confirmed by reduced Ku70/Ku80 protein binding to DSB, increased comet tail length and elevated γH2AX expression in treated cells compared to control. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that EGFR-mediated lowered DNA PK activity in treated cells compared to controls. Treatment with pMU and pMC shRNA reduced the expression of DNA PKcs and ATM, and elevated γH2AX levels in xenograft implanted nude mice. Glioma cells exposed to hypoxia and irradiation showed DSB accumulation and apoptosis after pMU and pMC treatments compared to respective controls.;Our results suggest that pMU and pMC shRNA reduce glioma proliferation by DSB accumulation and increase apoptosis under normoxia, hypoxia and in combination with irradiation. Considering the radio- and chemo-resistant cancers favored by hypoxia, our study provides important therapeutic potential of MMP9, uPAR and cathepsin B shRNA in the treatment of glioma from clinical stand point.",

These tumors are highly aggressive with a median survival of less than 2 years. Nuclear factor I (NFI) is a family of transcription factors that regulates the expression of glial genes in the developing brain. We have previously shown that regulation of the brain fatty acid-binding protein (B-FABP; FABP7) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) genes in MG cells is dependent on the phosphorylation state of NFI, with hypophosphorylation of NFI correlating with GFAP and B-FABP expression. Importantly, NFI phosphorylation is dependent on phosphatase activity that is enriched in GFAP/B-FABP+ve cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that NFI occupies the GFAP and B-FABP promoters in NFI-hypophosphorylated GFAP/B-FABP+ve MG cells. NFI occupancy, NFI-dependent transcriptional activity, and NFI phosphorylation are all modulated by the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin. Importantly, a cleaved form of calcineurin, associated with increased phosphatase activity, is specifically expressed in NFI-hypophosphorylated GFAP/B-FABP+ve MG cells. Calcineurin in GFAP/B-FABP+ve MG cells localizes to the nucleus. In contrast, calcineurin is primarily found in the cytoplasm of GFAP/B-FABP-ve cells, suggesting a dual mechanism for calcineurin activation in MG. Finally, our results demonstrate that calcineurin expression is up-regulated in areas of high infiltration/migration in grade IV astrocytoma tumor tissue. Our data suggest a critical role for calcineurin in NFI transcriptional regulation and in the determination of MG infiltrative properties. ",

In this study, experiments were conducted to characterize the P2Y receptor on C(6) glioma cells responsible for stimulating cell proliferation associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. 2. UTP and ATP produced a similar effect on [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, suggesting the involvement of P2Y(2) receptor in mediating proliferation of C(6) glioma cells. 3. In response to UTP, both p42 and p44 MAPK were activated in a time- and concentration-dependent manner using Western blot analysis with an anti-phospho-p42/p44 MAPK antibody. The phosphorylation reached maximal levels after 5 min and declining by 30 min. 4. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) did not change these responses to UTP. Both DNA synthesis and phosphorylation of MAPK in response to UTP were attenuated by tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and herbimycin A, protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, staurosporine and GF109203X, and removal of Ca(2+) by addition of BAPTA/AM plus EGTA. 5. UTP-induced [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation and p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation was completely inhibited by PD98059 (an inhibitor of MEK1/2). Furthermore, we showed that overexpression of dominant negative mutants of Ras (RasN17) and Raf (Raf-301) completely suppressed MEK1/2 and p42/p44 MAPK activation induced by ATP and UTP. 6. These results conclude that the mitogenic effect of UTP mediated through a P2Y(2) receptor that involves the activation of Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway.

Images were acquired by using a Stejskal-Tanner diffusion pulse sequence, with 16 values of b (0-900 s/mm(2)) in 3 orthogonal directions on 3T systems equipped with 32 multichannel receiver head coils. The intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion parameters were derived by fitting the intravoxel incoherent motion biexponential model. Regions of interest were drawn in regions of maximum intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion fraction and contralateral control regions. Statistical significance was assessed by using the Student t test. In addition, regions of interest were drawn around all whole tumors and were evaluated with the help of histograms.;In the regions of maximum perfusion fraction, perfusion fraction was significantly higher in the high-grade group (0.127 ± 0.031) than in the low-grade group (0.084 ± 0.016, P < .001) and in the contralateral control region (0.061 ± 0.011, P < .001). No statistically significant difference was observed for the pseudodiffusion coefficient. The perfusion fraction correlated moderately with dynamic susceptibility contrast relative CBV (r = 0.59). The histograms of the perfusion fraction showed a \"heavy-tailed\" distribution for high-grade but not low-grade gliomas.;The intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion fraction is helpful for differentiating high- from low-grade brain gliomas.",

The present study aimed to investigate the anti-glioma activity and underlying mechanisms of pregnenolone, which originates from cholesterol and is metabolized into important steroid hormones in the body. The results demonstrated that 100 μM pregnenolone induced a significant loss of cell viability in various malignant glioma cell lines. In the U-87 MG, LN-18 and C6 cell lines, the loss of cell viability resulted from cell apoptosis, which was evidenced by apoptotic nuclear morphology changes and caspase 3 activation. Moreover, the increased activities of caspase 8 and 9 strongly indicated that pregnenolone activated the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. Additionally, glioma cell apoptosis was prevented by the general caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK. In the C6 cells, upregulation of Fas and Fas ligand triggered the activation of the extrinsic pathway, whereas knockdown of Fas significantly abrogated the cell apoptosis that was induced by pregnenolone. Furthermore, downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein, B-cell lymphoma 2 and upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax and Bak, activated the intrinsic pathway. In conclusion, pregnenolone induced glioma cell apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner, which was mediated by activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.",

Calcineurin is one of the key regulators of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, but its mechanism is poorly understood. Hence, we studied subcellular localization of calcineurin after transcriptional downregulation of uPAR and cathepsin B in glioma. In the present study, efficient downregulation of uPAR and cathepsin B increased the translocation of calcineurin A from the mitochondria to the cytosol, decreased pBAD (S136) expression and its interaction with 14-3-3ζ and increased the interaction of BAD with Bcl-xl. Co-depletion of uPAR and cathepsin B induced mitochondrial translocation of BAD, activation of caspase 3 as well as PARP and cytochrome c and SMAC release. These effects were inhibited by FK506 (10 μM), a specific inhibitor of calcineurin. Calcineurin A was co-localized and also co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl-2. This interaction decreased with co-depletion of uPAR and cathepsin B and also with Bcl-2 inhibitor, HA 14-1 (20 μg/ml). Altered localization and interaction of calcineurin A with Bcl-2 was also observed in vivo when uPAR and cathepsin B were downregulated.

We assessed cell proliferation by labeling cells with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester and quantifying the fluorescence by FACS analysis. We also examined the cell cycle status using BrdU/propidium iodide double staining and FACS analysis. We evaluated changes in gene expression by microarray analysis following treatment with A-192621 in glioma cells. We examined the role of ETRB by reducing its expression level using small interfering RNA (siRNA).;We report that two ETRB-specific antagonists, A-192621 and BQ788, reduce the number of viable cells in two glioma cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We describe similar results for two melanoma cell lines. The more potent of the two antagonists, A-192621, decreases the mean number of cell divisions at least in part by inducing a G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Microarray analysis of the effects of A-192621 treatment reveals up-regulation of several DNA damage-inducible genes. These results were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Importantly, reducing expression of ETRB with siRNAs does not abrogate the effects of either A-192621 or BQ788 in glioma or melanoma cells. Furthermore, BQ123, an endothelin receptor type A (ETRA)-specific antagonist, has no effect on cell viability in any of these cell lines, indicating that the ETRB-independent effects on cell viability exhibited by A-192621 and BQ788 are not a result of ETRA inhibition.;While ETRB antagonists reduce the viability of glioma cells in vitro, it appears unlikely that this effect is mediated by ETRB inhibition or cross-reaction with ETRA. Instead, we present evidence that A-192621 affects glioma and melanoma viability by activating stress/DNA damage response pathways, which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Wild type mice revealed smaller tumors as compared to mice lacking functional T and B cells indicating that considerable immune dependent tumor rejection occurs physiologically in this model. However, glioma rejection was significantly enhanced in mice expressing IL-12 in the CNS and was predominantly dependent on the presence of CD8+ T cells while CD4+ T cells had less impact. Interestingly, the rejection of tumors was independent of IFN-gamma.

By Real-Time-PCR and western blot analysis, we found that TRPV2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were expressed in benign astrocyte tissues, and its expression progressively declined in high-grade glioma tissues as histological grade increased (n = 49 cases), and in U87MG cells and in MZC, FCL and FSL primary glioma cells. To investigate the function of TRPV2 in glioma, small RNA interfering was used to silence TRPV2 expression in U87MG cells. As evaluated by RT-Profiler PCR array, siTRPV2-U87MG transfected cells displayed a marked downregulation of Fas and procaspase-8 mRNA expression, associated with upregulation of cyclin E1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, E2F1 transcriptor factor 1, V-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bcl-X(L)) mRNA expression. TRPV2 silencing increased U87MG cell proliferation as shown by the increased percentage of cells incorporating 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine expressing beta(III)-tubulin and rescued glioma cells to Fas-induced apoptosis. These events were dependent on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation: indeed inhibition of ERK activation in siTRPV2-U87MG transfected cells by treatment with PD98059, a specific mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor, reduced Bcl-X(L) protein levels, promoted Fas expression, and restored Akt/protein kinase B pathway activation leading to reduced U87MG cell survival and proliferation, and increased sensitivity to Fas-induced apoptosis. In addition, transfection of TRPV2 in MZC glioma cells, by inducing Fas overexpression, resulted in a reduced viability and an increased spontaneous and Fas-induced apoptosis. Overall, our findings indicate that TRPV2 negatively controls glioma cell survival and proliferation, as well as resistance to Fas-induced apoptotic cell death in an ERK-dependent manner.",

In this study, the influence of gastrin on the in vitro cell cycle kinetics and the in vivo growth features of three experimental malignant gliomas was investigated.;Gastrin-induced influence on overall growth was assayed in vitro by means of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium colorimetric assay for human U373 and rat C6 gliomas and for rat 9L gliosarcoma. Although cell cycle analyses were performed by means of computer-assisted microscope analyses of Feulgen-stained nuclei, the gastrin-induced effects of the levels of expression of cyclins D3 and E, CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, CDK7, p15, p16, E2F1, and E2F2 were assayed by means of quantitative Western blot test. The presence of ribonucleic acids for the CCK(B) and CCK(C) gastrin receptors in the U373, C6, and 9L models was assayed by means of quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and the presence or absence of ribonucleic acids for CCK(A) receptor was checked by means of conventional polymerase chain reaction. The influence of gastrin was also characterized in vivo in terms of the survival periods of conventional rats orthotopically grafted with the C6 and 9L models and nude rats with the U373 model.;Gastrin significantly decreased the overall growth rate in the rat C6 and the human U373 high-grade astrocytic tumor models with either CCK(B) or CCK(C) gastrin receptor but not in the 9L rat gliosarcoma, which had no CCK(B) gastrin receptor (but had CCK(A) receptor) and only weak amounts of CCK(C) receptor. This effect seems to occur via a cytostatic effect; that is, an accumulation of tumor astrocytes occurs in the G(1) cell cycle phase. The cytostatic effect could relate to a gastrin-induced decrease in the amounts of the cyclin D3-CDK4 complex in both C6 and U373 glioma cells. In vivo, gastrin significantly increased the survival periods of C6 and U373 glioma-bearing rats, but not of 9L gliosarcoma-bearing rats.;Gastrin is able to significantly modify the growth levels of a number of experimental gliomas.",

It has also been reported that these compounds inhibit tumor cell spreading, but the molecular targets of this cannabinoid action remain elusive. Here, we evaluated the effect of cannabinoids on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and its effect on tumor cell invasion. Local administration of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major active ingredient of cannabis, down-regulated MMP-2 expression in gliomas generated in mice, as determined by Western blot, immunofluorescence, and real-time quantitative PCR analyses. This cannabinoid-induced inhibition of MMP-2 expression in gliomas (a) was MMP-2-selective, as levels of other MMP family members were unaffected; (b) was mimicked by JWH-133, a CB(2) cannabinoid receptor-selective agonist that is devoid of psychoactive side effects; (c) was abrogated by fumonisin B1, a selective inhibitor of ceramide biosynthesis; and (d) was also evident in two patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. THC inhibited MMP-2 expression and cell invasion in cultured glioma cells. Manipulation of MMP-2 expression by RNA interference and cDNA overexpression experiments proved that down-regulation of this MMP plays a critical role in THC-mediated inhibition of cell invasion. Cannabinoid-induced inhibition of MMP-2 expression and cell invasion was prevented by blocking ceramide biosynthesis and by knocking-down the expression of the stress protein p8. As MMP-2 up-regulation is associated with high progression and poor prognosis of gliomas and many other tumors, MMP-2 down-regulation constitutes a new hallmark of cannabinoid antitumoral activity.",

This combined treatment was also cytotoxic to glioma cells overexpressing Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, but not to normal human astrocytes, thus offering an attractive strategy for safely treating resistant gliomas. Cotreatment with sodium butyrate facilitated completion of proteolytic processing of procaspase-3 that was partially blocked by treatment with TRAIL alone. We also found that treatment with sodium butyrate significantly decreased the protein levels of survivin and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), two major caspase inhibitors. Overexpression of survivin and XIAP attenuated sodium butyrate-stimulated TRAIL-induced apoptosis, suggesting its involvement in conferring TRAIL resistance to glioma cells. Furthermore, the kinase activities of Cdc2 and Cdk2 were significantly decreased following sodium butyrate treatment, accompanying downregulation of cyclin A and cyclin B, as well as upregulation of p21. Forced expression of Cdc2 plus cyclin B, but not Cdk2 plus cyclin A, attenuated sodium butyrate/TRAIL-induced apoptosis, overriding sodium butyrate-mediated downregulation of survivin and XIAP. Therefore, Cdc2-mediated downregulation of survivin and XIAP by sodium butyrate may contribute to the recovery of TRAIL sensitivity in glioma cells.",

To date there is not a single approved drug to effectively treat these tumors and thus novel therapies are desperately needed. Recent studies suggest that a significant fraction of these tumors contain alterations in cell cycle regulatory genes including amplification of the D-type cyclins and CDK4/6, and less commonly, loss of Ink4a-ARF leading to aberrant cell proliferation. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic approach of targeting the cyclin-CDK-Retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway in a genetically engineered PDGF-B-driven brainstem glioma (BSG) mouse model. We found that PD-0332991 (PD), a CDK4/6 inhibitor, induces cell-cycle arrest in our PDGF-B; Ink4a-ARF deficient model both in vitro and in vivo. By contrast, the PDGF-B; p53 deficient model was mostly resistant to treatment with PD. We noted that a 7-day treatment course with PD significantly prolonged survival by 12% in the PDGF-B; Ink4a-ARF deficient BSG model. Furthermore, a single dose of 10 Gy radiation therapy (RT) followed by 7 days of treatment with PD increased the survival by 19% in comparison to RT alone. These findings provide the rationale for evaluating PD in children with Ink4a-ARF deficient gliomas. ",

We also conducted analysis to assess joint and haplotype effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on mutagen sensitivity. We further validate our results in an independent external control group totaling 662 subjects.;Of the 392 tSNPs examined, we found that mutagen sensitivity was modified by one tSNP in the EME2 gene and six tSNPs in the RAD51L1 gene (P < 0.01). Among the six RAD51L1 SNPs tested in the validation set, one (RAD51L1 rs2180611) was significantly associated with mutagen sensitivity (P = 0.025). Moreover, we found a significant dose-response relationship between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse tSNP genotypes. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that RAD51L1 haplotypes F-A (zero adverse allele) and F-E (six adverse alleles) exhibited the lowest (0.42) and highest (0.93) mean B/C values, respectively.

Immunoblot and immunocyto analysis demonstrated increased expression of p27(Kip1) and its nuclear localization with the knockdown of cathepsin B and uPAR. These effects could be mediated by alphaVbeta3/PI3K/AKT/FOXO pathway as observed by the decreased alphaVbeta3 expression, PI3K and AKT phosphorylation accompanied by elevated FOXO3a levels. These results were further confirmed with the increased expression of p27(Kip1) and FOXO3a when treated with Ly294002 (10 microM) and increased luciferase expression with the siRNA and Ly294002 treatments when the FOXO binding promoter region of p27(Kip1) was used. Our treatment also reduced the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, p-Rb and cyclin E while the expression of Cdk2 was unaffected. Of note, the Cdk2-cyclin E complex formation was reduced significantly.;Our study indicates that cathepsin B and uPAR knockdown induces G0/G1 arrest by modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and further increases expression of p27(Kip1) accompanied by the binding of FOXO3a to its promoter. Taken together, our findings provide molecular mechanism for the G0/G1 arrest induced by the downregulation of cathepsin B and uPAR in SNB19 and U251 glioma cells.",

The purpose of this study was to determine if the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) from diffusion imaging can help to differentiate between newly diagnosed grade II OD and AC subtypes and to evaluate the ADC and FA values for the mixed population of oligoastrocytomas (OA). Fifty-three patients with newly diagnosed grade II gliomas were studied using a 1.5T whole body scanner (23 ODs, 16 ACs, and 14 OAs). The imaging protocol included post-gadolinium T1-weighted images, T2-weighted images, and either three and/or six directional diffusion imaging sequence with b = 1000 s/mm(2). Diffusion-weighted images were analyzed using in-house software to calculate maps of ADC and for six directional acquisitions, FA. The intensity values were normalized by values from normal appearing white matter (NAWM) to generate maps of normalized apparent diffusion coefficient (nADC) and normalized fractional anisotropy (nFA). The hyperintense region in the T2 weighted image was defined as the T2All region. A Mann-Whitney rank-sum test was performed on the 25th, median, and 75th nADC and nFA among the three subtypes. Logistic regression was performed to determine how well the nADC and nFA predict subtype. Lesions diagnosed as being OD had significantly lower nADC and significantly higher nFA, compared to AC. The nADC and nFA values individually classified the data with an accuracy of 87%. Combining the two did not enhance the classification. The patients with OA had nADC and nFA values between those of OD and AC. This suggests that ADC and FA may be helpful in directing tissue sampling to the most appropriate regions for taking biopsies in order to make a definitive diagnosis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The tumor suppressor gene PTEN (MMAC1, TEP1) encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase and is considered a progression-associated target of genetic alterations in human gliomas. Recently, it has been reported that the introduction of wild type PTEN into glioma cells containing endogenous mutant PTEN alleles (U87MG, LN-308), but not in those which retain wild-type PTEN (LN-18, LN-229), causes growth suppression and inhibits cellular migration, spreading and focal adhesion. Here, we show that PTEN gene transfer has no effect on the chemosensitivity of the four cell lines. Further, a correlational analysis of the endogenous PTEN status of 12 human glioma cell lines with their sensitivity to seven different cancer chemotherapy drugs reveals no link between PTEN and chemosensitivity. In contrast, ectopic expression of wild type PTEN, but not the PTEN(G129R) mutant, in PTEN-mutant gliomas markedly sensitizes these cells to irradiation and to CD95-ligand (CD95L)-induced apoptosis. PTEN-mediated facilitation of CD95L-induced apoptosis is associated with enhanced CD95L-evoked caspase 3 activity. Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), previously shown to inhibit CD95L-induced apoptosis in nonglial COS7 cells, is inactivated by dephosphorylation. Interestingly, both PTEN-mutant U87MG and PTEN-wild-type LN-229 cells contain phosphorylated PKB constitutively. Wild-type PTEN gene transfer promotes dephosphorylation of PKB specifically in U87MG cells but not in LN-229 cells. Sensitization of U87MG cells to CD95L-apoptosis by wild-type PTEN is blocked by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). The protection by IGF-1 is inhibited by the phosphoinositide 3-OH (PI 3) kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. Although PKB is a down-stream target of PI 3 kinase, the protection by IGF-1 was not associated with the reconstitution of PKB phosphorylation. Thus, PTEN may sensitize human malignant glioma cells to CD95L-induced apoptosis in a PI 3 kinase-dependent manner that may not require PKB phosphorylation.",

MTT assay was firstly examined to determine non-cytotoxic dose range, then gelatin zymography, matrigel invasion assay, migration assay and MMP-2 activity assay for 24 h exposure in indomethacin were employed to assess the inhibitory effect of indomethacin. MTT assay revealed that dose with 0, 50, and 500 microM/ml were non-cytotoxic. Zymography demonstrated: (a) expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity was downregulated along with elevated dose of indomethacin. (b) MMP-2 activity that changed from pro-MMP-2 to active form of MMP-2 in supernatants of cell lines could not be inhibited by indomethacin. Invasion assay disclosed that the number of invading cells through the matrigel were significantly decreased in a dose dependent manner. Migration assay indicated indomethacin did not affect cells migration. MMP-2 activity assay showed the total and active MMP-2 secretion was suppressed by 500 microM/ml of indomethacin. Our present study is the first report on inhibitive effect of indomethacin mediated by MMP-2 and MMP-9 in invasion assay of glioma cell lines. The current study suggested that non-cytotoxic level of indomethacin was able to reduce the cell invasion of malignant gliomas mediated by MMP-2 and MMP-9, but it did not affected on cell motility. It also lowered down the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and could reduce of MMP-2 secretion of cell lines.

Over the last several years, several noncytotoxic molecular targeted therapies have been developed against growth factor receptors and tumor angiogenesis. In gliomas, two main anti-growth factor receptor strategies have been evaluated in phase I/II clinical trials: (a) small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and (b) monoclonal antibodies that target growth factors or growth factor receptors other than vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Up to now, few glioma patients have responded to small TKIs (0%-14%) or monoclonal antibodies (three case reports) delivered as a single agent. Greater doses, combined therapies, as well as the identification of molecular biomarkers predictive of response and resistance are important in order to optimize drug delivery and improve efficacy. Antiangiogenic therapies are promising for the treatment of gliomas. Thalidomide and metronomic chemotherapy were the first antiangiogenic strategies evaluated, but they have shown only modest activity. Recent studies of bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody, and irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, have demonstrated a high response rate, suggesting that targeted antiangiogenic therapies may play a significant role in the management of high-grade gliomas in the future. However, the toxicity profiles of these agents are not fully defined and the radiological evaluation of possible tumor response is challenging.

Even with targeted therapeutic agent, bevacitumab, malignant glioma often develops resistance and recurrence. Thus, developing alternative interventions (therapeutic targets, biomarkers) is urgently required. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) has been long implicated in B cell malignancies but surprisingly it has recently been shown to also play a tumorigenic role in solid tumors such as ovarian and prostate cancer. Bioinformatics data indicates that Btk is significantly higher in clinical glioma samples as compared to normal brain cells and Btk expression level is associated with stage progression. This prompts us to investigate the potential role of Btk as a therapeutic target for glioma. Here, we demonstrate Btk expression is associated with GBM tumorigenesis. Down-regulation of Btk in GBM cell lines showed a significantly reduced abilities in colony formation, migration and GBM sphere-forming potential. Mechanistically, Btk-silenced cells showed a concomitant reduction in the expression of CD133 and Akt/mTOR signaling. In parallel, Ibrutinib (a Btk inhibitor) treatment led to a similar anti-tumorigenic response. Using xenograft mouse model, tumorigenesis was significantly reduced in Btk-silenced or ibrutinib-treated mice as compared to control counterparts. Finally, our glioma tissue microarray analysis indicated a higher Btk staining in the malignant tumors than less malignant and normal brain tissues.

ATF5 is an anti-apoptotic protein that is highly expressed in malignant glioma and is essential for glioma cell survival. Accumulating evidence indicates that human malignant gliomas are universally infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Recent studies have shown that HCMV may be resistant to the induction of apoptosis by disrupting cellular pathways in glioblastoma. To investigate the potential anti-apoptotic function of HCMV in glioma, malignant U87 glioma cells were infected with HCMV. The present study showed that HCMV infection suppressed apoptosis in glioblastoma U87 cells by regulating the expression of ATF5. Furthermore, in glioblastoma U87 cells, HCMV infection induced cellular proliferation in parallel with an increase in the expression level of ATF5 and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 to Bcl-2-associated X protein ratio. Loss of ATF5 function was achieved using a dominant-negative form of ATF5 in U87 cells, whereby cells appeared to grow marginally following HCMV infection when compared with the control. However, the anti-apoptotic ability was appeared to decline in the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay. These results indicate that ATF5 signaling pathways may be important in the anti-apoptotic activity of HCMV-infected glioblastoma cells; therefore, the anti-apoptotic molecular mechanisms of HCMV in human glioblastoma cells were investigated in the current study.

Mechanistic studies into identification of novel biomarkers are needed to develop new therapeutic strategies for this deadly disease. The objective for this study was to explore the potential direct impact of IL-17-IL-17R interaction in gliomas. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry analysis of 12 tumor samples obtained from patients with high grade gliomas revealed that a considerable population (2-19%) of cells in all malignant gliomas expressed IL-17RA, with remarkable co-expression of the glioma stem cell (GSC) markers CD133, Nestin, and Sox2. IL-17 enhanced the self-renewal of GSCs as determined by proliferation and Matrigel® colony assays. IL-17 also induced cytokine/chemokine (IL-6, IL-8, interferon-γ-inducible protein [IP-10], and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1]) secretion in GSCs, which were differentially blocked by antibodies against IL-17R and IL-6R. Western blot analysis showed that IL-17 modulated the activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and β-catenin in GSCs. While IL-17R-mediated secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly blocked by inhibitors of NF-κB and STAT3; NF-κB inhibitor was more potent than STAT3 inhibitor in blocking IL-17-induced MCP-1 secretion. Overall, our results suggest that IL-17-IL-17R interaction in GSCs induces an autocrine/paracrine cytokine feedback loop, which may provide an important signaling component for maintenance/self-renewal of GSCs via constitutive activation of both NF-κB and STAT3. The results also strongly implicate IL-17R as an important functional biomarker for therapeutic targeting of GSCs. ",

Here we introduce drug encapsulated aerosolized microspheres as a biodegradable, intelligent glioma therapy (DREAM BIG therapy). DREAM BIG therapy is envisioned to deliver three chemotherapeutics, temporally staged over one year, via a bioadhesive, biodegradable spray directly to the brain surgical site after tumor excision. In this proof-of-principle article exploring key components of the DREAM BIG therapy prototype, rhodamine B (RB) encapsulated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) encapsulated poly(lactic acid) microspheres were formulated and characterized. The encapsulation efficiency of RB and IgG and the release kinetics of the model drugs from the microspheres were elucidated in addition to the release kinetics of RB from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres formulated in a degradable poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) solution. The successful aerosolized application onto brain tissue ex-vivo demonstrated the conformal adhesion of the RB encapsulated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres to the convoluted brain surface mediated by the thermoresponsive carrier, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide). These preliminary results suggest the potential of the DREAM BIG therapy for future use with multiple chemotherapeutics and microsphere types to combat gliomas at a localized site.",

In this study, we used in vitro and in vivo assays to examine the differentiation effects of wogonin, a major active constituent of Scutellaria baicalensis, on glioma C6 and U251 cells. We found that wogonin can suppress cell proliferation and induce G0/G1 arrest under a concentration-dependent manner. Wogonin also triggered significant reduction in the G1 cell-cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and 4 along with overexpression of cell-cycle inhibitory proteins p27. Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis indicated that wogonin increased the expression of lineage-specific differentiation marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In mechanisms, we verified that wogonin significantly diminished the phosphorylated level of protein kinase B (AKT), and maintenance of low β-catenin expression level was dependent on glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activation at Ser9. Blocking GSK3β/β-catenin pathway was required for wogonin-induced proliferation inhibition and terminal differentiation by using canonical activator lithium chloride (LiCl) and inhibitor dickkopf-1 (Dkk1). Moreover, intravenous administration of wogonin delayed the growth of C6 glioma in the intracranial tumor model. These findings provide the evidence and mechanistic support for wogonin-based differentiation therapies for malignant glioblastoma. Furthermore, inhibition of GSK3β/β-catenin pathway may be a key and requisite factor in glioma differentiation. ",

Treatment of partially resected or recurrent tumors is challenging, and the factors associated with increased recurrence risk are not well defined. Identification of favorable and unfavorable factors can lead to a better understanding and management of patients with PA. We studied the pathologic characteristics of 116 intracranial PAs from 4 institutions representing 3 distinct geographic regions to identify factors that may be associated with biological behavior. The study included 65 boys and 51 girls with a median age of 6 years. Median follow-up for all patients was 101 months, during which time 38 patients had recurrence. Progression-free and overall survivals were better in patients who underwent gross total resection. We were not able to identify any differences in pathologic and molecular markers among the 4 institutions from 3 different countries. However, progression-free survival varied significantly among institutions. Sox-2 was the most prevalent stem cell marker in PA, and many tumors showed synaptophysin positivity. BRAF immunostaining was not useful in determining BRAF duplication. BRAF duplication was more typical of posterior fossa tumors. There was a strong correlation between BRAF duplication and pERK immunostaining, suggesting that the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is active in these tumors. This finding has significant implications given its role in oncogen-induced senescence and possible influence on treatment decisions of subtotally resected tumors.",

We also observed that the broad caspase inhibitor, Z-Asp-2, 6-dichlorobenzoylmethylketone rescued pCU-induced apoptosis in U251 cells but not in 5310 cells. Immunoblot analysis of caspase-9 immunoprecipitates for Apaf-1 showed that uPAR and cathepsin B knockdown activated apoptosome complex formation in U251 cells. Downregulation of uPAR and cathepsin B also retarded nuclear translocation and interfered with DNA binding activity of CREB in both U251 and 5310 cells. Further western blotting analysis demonstrated that downregulation of uPAR and cathepsin B significantly decreased expression of the signaling molecules p-PDGFR-β, p-PI3K and p-Akt. An increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells, increased Bax expression, and decreased Bcl-2 expression in nude mice brain tumor sections and brain tissue lysates confirm our in vitro results.;In conclusion, RNAi-mediated downregulation of uPAR and cathepsin B initiates caspase-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis in U251 cells and caspase-independent mitochondrial apoptosis in 5310 cells. Thus, targeting uPAR and cathepsin B-mediated signaling using siRNA may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of gliomas.",

Here, 20 pediatric HGAs (9 DIPGs and 11 supratentorial HGAs) were subject to gene expression profiling following approval by the research ethics board at our institution. Many of these tumors showed expression signatures composed of genes that promote G1/S and G2/M cell cycle progression. In particular, Aurora kinase B (AURKB) was consistently and highly overexpressed in 6/9 DIPGs and 8/11 HGAs. Array data were validated using quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, as well as cross-validation of our data set with previously published series.

The results from the absorbed polyclonal antiserum have been confirmed by the successful generation of six stable murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which recognize a subset of the same antigens with high specificity on immunoblots and with no apparent cross-reactivities by RIA to normal brain, serum, liver, muscle, kidney, spleen, or melanoma tissues. Moreover, the tested murine MAbs (B12C4) reveal a striking and abundant glial filament protein, possibly related to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or other intermediate filament proteins, by frozen-section immunofluorescence. This is seen only in gliomas and is absent, or dramatically reduced, in normal human cortex. Use of potent immortalizing strain (FF41) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to establish antibody-secreting human lymphoblastoid lines, and the generation of mouse-human chimeric fusions, have yielded lines possessing variable supernatant human antibody secretion. Radioimmunoassays using culture supernatants, and sera from glioma patients and an normal individual, have demonstrated surprisingly similar reactivity profiles, even after a sensitive sandwich RIA employing the B6C6 murine MAb. These results suggest that, although human glioma-associated antigens, including possibly the up-regulation of GFAP expression, clearly exist, there seems to be a muted humoral response as evidenced by a paucity of tumor-specific B-cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"Integrin α5β1 expression is correlated with a worse prognosis in high-grade glioma. We previously unraveled a negative crosstalk between integrin α5β1 and p53 pathway, which was proposed to be part of the resistance of glioblastoma to chemotherapies. The restoration of p53 tumor-suppressor function is under intensive investigations for cancer therapy. However, p53-dependent apoptosis is not always achieved by p53-reactivating compounds such as Nutlin-3a, although full transcriptional activity of p53 could be obtained. Here we investigated whether integrin α5β1 functional inhibition or repression could sensitize glioma cells to Nutlin-3a-induced p53-dependent apoptosis. We discovered that α5β1 integrin-specific blocking antibodies or small RGD-like antagonists in association with Nutlin-3a triggered a caspase (Casp) 8/Casp 3-dependent strong apoptosis in glioma cells expressing a functional p53. We deciphered the molecular mechanisms involved and we showed the crucial role of two anti-apoptotic proteins, phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15 (PEA-15) and survivin in glioma cell apoptotic outcome. PEA-15 is under α5β1 integrin/AKT (protein kinase B) control and survivin is a p53-repressed target. Moreover, interconnections between integrin and p53 pathways were revealed. Indeed PEA-15 repression by specific small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-activated p53 pathway to repress survivin and conversely survivin repression by specific siRNA decreased α5β1 integrin expression. This pro-apoptotic loop could be generalized to several glioma cell lines, whatever their p53 status, inasmuch PEA-15 and survivin protein levels were decreased. Our findings identify a novel mechanism whereby inhibition of α5β1 integrin and activation of p53 modulates two anti-apoptotic proteins crucially involved in the apoptotic answer of glioma cells. Importantly, our results suggest that high-grade glioma expressing high level of α5β1 integrin may benefit from associated therapies including integrin antagonists and repressors of survivin expression.

Twenty-eight specimens, obtained from 14 patients before and after TMZ treatment, were analyzed to investigate whether induction of autophagy could be detected in surgical specimens by immunohistochemical analysis. Macroautophagy was monitored by immunohistochemical analysis employing anti-light chain 3 isoform B (LC3B) and anti-lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) antibodies; chaperone-mediated autophagy was monitored by anti-LAMP2A antibody immunostaining. Furthermore, detection of LC3B protein by Western blotting was performed on six specimens obtained from the preserved frozen tissues of three patients. All specimens showed dot-like staining for each immunostain in the cytoplasm of glioma cells, indicating induction of autophagy. LC3B, LAMP1 and LAMP2A immunostains were semiquantitatively scored from 1 to 3 points. Combination of the three scores after TMZ treatment (6.4 ± 1.2) showed a significant increase (P = 0.020) compared to pre-treatment scores (5.2 ± 1.5).

Due to heterogeneity and different degrees of vascularisation cell subpopulations possess varying resistance to chemo- or radiation therapy. Therefore, therapy is dependent on the ability to specifically target a tumour cell. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a bimodal method, in radiation therapy, taking advantage of the ability of the stable isotope boron-10 to capture neutrons. It results in disintegration products depositing large amounts of energy within a short length, approximately one cell diameter. Thereby, selective irradiation of a target cell may be accomplished if a sufficient amount of boron has been accumulated and hence the cell-associated boron concentration is of critical importance. The accumulation of boron, boronophenylalanine (BPA), was investigated in two human glioma cell subpopulations and a human fibroblast cell line in vitro. The cells were incubated at low boron concentrations (0-5 microg B/ml). Oil filtration was then used for separation of extracellular and cell-associated boron. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was used for boron determination. Significant (P < 0.05) differences in accumulation ratio (relation between cell-associated and extracellular boron concentration) between human malignant glioma cell lines were found. Human fibroblasts, used to represent normal cells, showed a growth-dependent uptake and a lower accumulation ratio than the glioma cells. Our findings indicate that BPA concentration, incubation time and differences in boron uptake between cell subpopulations should be considered in BNCT.",

Chemotherapy frequently results in DNA damage. When such damage is sensed by the cell, programmed cell death, or apoptosis, may be initiated. However, chemotherapy-induced DNA damage may activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and block apoptosis. We inhibited NF-kappaB using a gene therapy approach to determine whether this would render human glioma cells more susceptible to chemotherapy. U87 and U251 glioma cell lines were infected with either treatment adenovirus containing the gene for a mutant non-degradable form of IkappaBalpha, which is an inhibitor of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, or empty control virus. Following viral infection, cells were treated either with BCNU, carboplatin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), or SN-38. Chemotherapy resulted in a marked increase in active intranuclear NF-kappaB. This response was greatly decreased by insertion of the mutant repressor gene. Similarly, a significant increase in cell killing by all chemotherapy age was demonstrated following infection with treatment virus. Expression of the mutant repressor gene also resulted in increased apoptosis by TUNEL assay following chemotherapy. Numerous genes are responsible for glioma chemoresistance. DNA damage by chemotherapy may induce the antiapoptotic factor NF-kappaB and prevent programmed cell death. Insertion of a mutant inhibitor of NF-kappaB strips cells of this antiapoptotic defense and renders them more susceptible to killing by chemotherapy via increased apoptosis.",

Sorafenib (Bay43-9006; Nexavar) is a dual-action Raf and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor that blocks receptor phosphorylation and MAPK-mediated signaling and inhibits growth in a number of tumor types. Because our initial studies of this agent in a series of glioma cell lines showed only partial growth inhibition at clinically achievable concentrations, we questioned whether inhibition of PKC signaling using the PKC-delta inhibitor rottlerin might potentiate therapeutic efficacy. Proliferation assays, apoptosis induction studies, and Western immunoblot analysis were conducted in cells treated with sorafenib and rottlerin as single agents or in combination. Sorafenib and rottlerin reduced proliferation in all cell lines when used as single agents, and the combination produced marked potentiation of growth inhibition. Flow-cytometric measurements of cells stained with Annexin V-propidium iodide and immunocytochemical assessment of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor release demonstrated that addition of rottlerin resulted in significantly higher levels of apoptosis than sorafenib alone. In addition, the combination of sorafenib and rottlerin reduced or completely inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Akt and down-regulated cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclin-D1, cyclin-D3, cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)4, and cdk6 in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

In human glioma cell lines and tissues, we found very low levels of SOX5 compared with normal brain. Overexpression of Sox5 in human glioma cells led to a reduction in clone formation and inhibition of proliferation. Combined expression of Sox5 and PDGFB in primary brain cell cultures caused decreased proliferation and an increased number of senescent cells in the Ink4a-/- cells only. Protein analyses showed a reduction in the amount and activation of Akt and increased levels of p27(Kip1) upon Sox5 expression that was dominant to PDGFB signaling and specific to Ink4a-/- cells. Upon inhibition of p27(Kip1), the effects of Sox5 on proliferation and senescence could be reversed.

To assess the relationship between genetic abnormalities and clinicopathological characteristics, we have performed a genetic and clinical analysis of a series of gliomas. A total of 112 gliomas were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization on a BAC array with a 1 megabase resolution. Altered regions were identified and correlation analysis enabled to retrieve significant associations and exclusions. Whole chromosomes (chrs) 1p and 19q losses with centromeric breakpoints and EGFR high level amplification were found to be mutually exclusive, permitting identification of 3 distinct, nonoverlapping groups of tumors with striking clinicopathological differences. Type A tumors with chrs 1p and 19q co-deletion exhibited an oligodendroglial phenotype and a longer patient survival. Type B tumors were characterized by EGFR amplification. They harbored a WHO high grade of malignancy and a short patient survival. Finally, type C tumors displayed none of the previous patterns but the presence of chr 7 gain, chr 9p deletion and/or chr 10 loss. It included astrocytic tumors in patients younger than in type B and whose prognosis was highly dependent upon the number of alterations. A multivariate analysis based on a Cox model shows that age, WHO grade and genomic type provide complementary prognostic informations. Finally, our results highlight the potential of a whole-genome analysis as an additional diagnostic in cases of unclear conventional genetic findings.",

Chemoresistance is a common feature of malignant gliomas. Since receptor tyrosine kinases contribute to chemoresistance in tumors, we addressed whether PDGFR signaling might confer selective growth advantage to chemoresistant cells. The effects of the PDGFR inhibitor STI571 on proliferation and PDGFR signaling were compared in chemosensitive and cisplatin-selected, chemoresistant sublines derived from glioma and from two other PDGFR-expressing tumors (ovarian carcinoma and neuroblastoma). The chemoresistant glioma U87/Pt cells were twofold more sensitive to STI571 growth-inhibitory effects than the chemosensitive U87 cells, and two- to threefold more sensitive than five unrelated glioma cell lines. The other two paired cell lines were equally responsive. Sensitization of U87/Pt cells correlated with upregulation of the PDGF-B isoform and with PDGF-BB-induced Akt overactivation, which was prevented by STI571. STI571 specifically inhibited PDGF-BB-, but not PDGF-AA- or stem cell factor-mediated signaling. In serum-containing medium, STI571 decreased phospho-Akt in U87/Pt cells, but not in U87, while activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) in both. STI571 antiproliferative effects were partially reverted by constitutively active Akt. Cotreatment with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) resulted in enhanced growth inhibition in glioma cells. Our results suggest that increased PDGF-BB signaling may sensitize chemoresistant glioma cells to STI571, suggesting a therapeutic potential for STI571 in patients with malignant gliomas refractory to chemotherapy. Simultaneous blockade of PDGFR and PI3K or Erk pathway may enhance therapeutic targeting in gliomas.",

In 6 patients it was associated to cytosine arabinoside (4 g/course, 1 to 9 courses every 4 weeks).;4 non-responder patients died 2.5 to 4 months after starting therapy. One patient who had been reoperated before receiving ATRA and cytosine arabinoside (5 course) had no sign of tumor recurrence after 17 months of treatment. In 4 responder patients (2 glioblastoma and 2 anaplastic astrocytoma) a clinical and radiological stabilization (time to progression) during 9 +/- 2.5 months was observed. This stabilization was associated in 3 of them with the appearance of intra tumoral calcifications visualized on repeated CT scans and confirmed in one patient by post-mortem examination. All of them had received cytosine arabinoside (1 to 9 courses) with ATRA; however small calcifications were also observed in one non-responder patient who did not receive aracytine.;These results suggest: a) a therapeutic effect of ATRA in combination with cytosine arabinoside in patients with relapsing malignant gliomas b) that intratumoral calcifications are related to the effects of ATRA on differentiation and/or on endothelial t-PA production and that these effects explain the tumor progression arrest in responder patients. The transient efficiency is probably related to the pharmacokinetics of ATRA or to changes of cellular mechanisms that modulate the cell response to the drug and is a critical issue for this therapy.",

At the Medical College of Wisconsin, 34 patients less than 15 years of age (median, 7.3 years of age) with cerebellar astrocytomas were seen from 1965 to 1988. Effect of histologic condition and treatment on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed. Progression was defined as radiographic evidence of an enlarging mass and/or signs and symptoms indicative of advancing disease. Histologic material was reviewed and classified by the system of Winston and Gilles. Twenty-eight patients had glioma A tumors, and six patients had glioma B tumors. For patients with glioma A (n = 28), 5-year actuarial OS rate was 100%. For patients with glioma B (n = 6), 5-year actuarial OS rate was 41%. PFS rate was 66% and 0% for patients with glioma A and glioma B, respectively. The poorer PFS for patients with B histologic tumors was statistically significant (P less than 0.001). The median time to progression was 36 months and 23 months for patients with glioma A and B, respectively. Patients were retrospectively divided into total resection and observation, total resection and irradiation, subtotal resection and observation, and subtotal resection and irradiation groups, which were composed of 12, 2, 3, and 17 patients, respectively. Five-year actuarial OS rates were 100%, 50%, 50%, and 100%, respectively. PFS rates were 60%, 50%, 33% and 58%, respectively. These data support the Gilles classification as a prognostic tool because patients with B tumors had a higher incidence of disease progression and accounted for all deaths. Postoperative irradiation after subtotal resection seems to be beneficial, but additional investigation, ideally with a prospective randomized trial, will be necessary to firmly establish this.",

Molecular genetic abnormalities and activation of signaling pathways associated with clinically aggressive PA and histologically anaplastic PA have not been adequately studied. We performed molecular genetic, gene expression, and immunohistochemical studies using three PA subsets, including conventional PA (n = 43), clinically aggressive/recurrent PA (n = 24), and histologically anaplastic PA (n = 25). A clinical diagnosis of NF1 was present in 28% of anaplastic PA. Molecular cytogenetic studies demonstrated heterozygous PTEN/10q and homozygous p16 deletions in 6/19 (32%) and 3/15 (20%) cases of anaplastic PA, respectively, but in neither of the two other groups. BRAF duplication was identified in 33% of sporadic anaplastic PA and 63% of cerebellar examples. BRAF (V600E) mutation was absent in four (of 4) sporadic cases lacking duplication. IDH1(R132H) immunohistochemistry was negative in 16 (of 16) cases. Neither PDGFRA nor EGFR amplifications were present. pERK staining levels were similar among the three PA subsets, but a stepwise increase in cytoplasmic pAKT and to a lesser extent pS6 immunoreactivity was noted by immunohistochemistry in aggressive PA groups. This was particularly true in histologically anaplastic PA when compared with conventional PA (p < 0.001 and p = 0.005, respectively). In addition, PTEN expression at the mRNA level was decreased in histologically anaplastic PA when compared to the other groups (p = 0.05). In summary, activation of the PI3K/AKT in addition to MAPK/ERK signaling pathways may underlie biological aggressiveness in PA. Specifically, it may mediate the increased proliferative activity observed in histologically anaplastic PA.",

Despite existing assessment methods, the availability of a simple but reliable preoperative grading based on functional data would therefore prove to be indispensable for the prediction of postoperative outcome and hence for overall survival in glioma patients. We performed a clinical investigation comprising 322 patients with gliomas and developed a novel classification system of preoperative tumor status, which considers tumor operability based on two graduations (Friedlein Grading - FG): FGA with lesions at safe distance to eloquent regions which can be completely resected, and FGB referring to tumors which can only be partially resected or biopsied. Investigation of outcome revealed that FGA were characterized by a significantly longer overall survival time compared to FGB. We offer the opportunity to classify brain tumors in a dependable and reproducible manner.

In contrast, the SA classification is based on the distinction of two patterns of tumor growth, solid tumor tissue versus isolated tumor cells and also relies on imaging and clinical features. According to this approach, the SA classification includes in the category of oligodendrogliomas, the fibrillary or gemistocytic diffuse astrocytomas (WHO grade II) as well as a substantial proportion of astrocytomas WHO grade III, 2) the WHO uses multiple histological criteria for the grading of oligodendrogliomas (grade II versus grade III), including the degree of differentiation, cellular atypia, mitotic activity and necrosis. In contrast, the SA grading of these tumors (grade A versus B) only uses two criteria: the presence or absence of endothelial hyperplasia, and the presence or absence of contrast enhancement. This last criterion allows overcoming the problems related to the representativeness of surgical samples. Difficulties and discrepancies regarding the diagnosis of oligodendrogliomas are in part due to the lack of immunomarker for the identification of tumoral oligodendrocytes.

Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. Data was analysed based on Grounded Theory and using the constant comparison method. This paper focuses on patient and carer perceptions of the initial communication about the diagnosis of high grade glioma and its prognosis. Themes identified included: (a) shock at hearing the diagnosis; (b) trying to understand and process prognostic information when still in shock; (c) the perception of hope being taken away; (d) individualizing prognostic information; and (e) clinicians' lack of communication skills. This study shows that the first communication of prognosis to patients with high grade glioma and their caregivers requires careful negotiation. It illustrates the inability of individuals to process detailed prognostic information when in a state of initial shock and distress. The importance of balancing honesty with hope in the communication of a poor prognosis is highlighted. We recommend that clinicians seek patient preferences for the amount and type of information they require and that prognostic information be individualized.

These included 11 patients with malignant gliomas, six with low-grade gliomas, and one with a recurrent glioma. They were stratified into three groups according to tumor volume (TV). Fifteen were treated using the initial FSRS dose schedule and form the subject of this report. Group A (four patients), had TV of 5 cm3 or less (7 Gy twice pre- and twice post-CEBRT); Group B (six patients), TV greater than 5 cm3 but less than or equal to 15 cm3 (7 Gy twice pre-CEBRT and once post-CEBRT); and Group C (five patients), TV greater than 15 cm3 but less than or equal to 30 cm3 (7 Gy once pre- and once post-CEBRT). All patients received CEBRT to 59.4 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions. Dose escalation was planned, provided the level of toxicity was acceptable. All patients were able to complete CEBRT without interruption or experiencing disease progression. Unacceptable toxicity was observed in two Grade 4/Group B patients and two Grade 4/Group C patients. Eight patients required reoperation. In three (38%) there was necrosis without evidence of tumor. Neuroimaging studies were available for evaluation in 14 patients. Two had a partial (> or = 50%) reduction in volume and nine had a minor (> 20%) reduction in size. The median follow-up period was 15 months (range 9-60 months). Six patients remained alive for 3 to 60 months.;The imaging responses and the ability of these patients with intracranial gliomas to complete therapy without interruption or experiencing disease progression is encouraging. Excessive toxicity derived from combined FSRS and CEBRT treatment, as evaluated thus far in this study, was seen in patients with Group B and C lesions at the 7-Gy dose level. Evaluation of this novel treatment strategy with dose modification is ongoing.",

Eleven patients, six with glioblastoma multiforme and five with WHO grade III gliomas, median age 50 years, with a Karnofsky performance score of 80-100 participated in ten group training sessions of 90 min. For evaluation at baseline and after the training by a neuropsychologist not involved in care or training of the patients, Trail Making Tests A and B (TMTA and TMTB), Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), and the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWA) were used. Comparison of mean group differences between baseline and at post-training evaluation after 12 weeks revealed improvement across all neurocognitive variables. The patients showed a great diversity in their performances, with worsening, improvement, and stabilization. However, a significant group difference was detected only for the HVLT (score 19.6 +/- 8.9 at baseline, 23.6 +/- 8.8 after 12 weeks, P = 0.04).

Astrocytes support neurons by releasing neurotrophic factors including GDNF. It has been reported that various agents including cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1beta induce GDNF mRNA expression and the release in astrocytes. However, the mechanism behind the GDNF synthesis and release remains unclear. Herein, we investigated the mechanisms of the IL-1beta-induced GDNF release from rat C6 glioma cells. IL-1beta time dependently stimulated GDNF release from C6 cells. IL-1beta induced the phosphorylation of inhibitor kappa B (IkappaB), p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, p44/p42 MAP kinase, stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3. The IL-1beta-stimulated levels of GDNF were suppressed by wedelolactone, an inhibitor of IkappaB kinase, SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, PD98059, an inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase 1/2 or Janus family of tyrosine kinase (JAK) inhibitor I, an inhibitor of upstream kinase of STAT3. On the contrary, SP600125, an inhibitor of SAPK/JNK, failed to reduce the IL-1beta-effect. These results strongly suggest that IL-1beta stimulates GDNF release through the pathways of IkappaB-nuclear factor kappa B, p38 MAP kinase, p44/p42 MAP kinase and JAK-STAT3, but not through the SAPK/JNK pathway in glioma cells.",

Ten microns thick frozen tissue was cut out on a cryostat and divided into three different parts on the histology stained with HE, ie, the tumor region(T), brain tissues with tumor infiltration(I), and the border region between these two parts(B). These sections were air-dried, and fixed with cold acetone (-4 degrees C) for 5min. Adjacent sections were immunohistochemically stained by ABC method, using monoclonal antibody for FN-R and polyclonal antibodies for FN and LN. FN, LN and FN-R were all stained at the vascular and pial-glial basement membranes intensely in all gliomas. In immunostain for FN, fine networks of FN were observed in the extracellular space in all three parts. Some tumor cells were clustered around such networks of FN in brain tissues with tumor infiltration. Immunostain for LN demonstrated that the vascularity in the border between the tumor and the brain with tumor infiltration was much higher than that in other parts.

Although an O2A-like glial progenitor cell of origin has been suggested, a neuronal-oligodendroglial progenitor cell is also of interest, particularly because variable degrees of neuronal marker expression have been reported in typical oligodendrogliomas. We present 2 female and 2 male patients (ages 34-54) with frontal lobe oligodendrogliomas containing a) morphologically distinct collections of small round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, b) well-formed Homer Wright-like and perivascular rosettes, and c) demonstrable neuronal differentiation by immunohistochemistry and/or electron microscopy in the rosette-associated regions. Unlike extraventricular neurocytomas, these cases featured an infiltrative growth pattern and a classic oligodendroglioma immunophenotype in non-rosette bearing portions of each tumor. FISH analysis demonstrated chromosome 1p and 19q codeletions in 3 (75%) cases, both in regions with and without rosettes. Recurrences were common, although all patients are currently alive 4 months to 13 yr from initial diagnosis. Based on clinicopathologic and genetic features, we diagnosed these tumors as oligodendrogliomas with neurocytic differentiation. However, it is unclear whether they represent a) gliomas with divergent neuronal differentiation, b) a distinctive form of glioneuronal neoplasm, or c) a reflection of glioneuronal histogenesis in oligodendrogliomas in general. In any case, their occurrence suggests a histogenetic overlap between oligodendroglioma and extraventricular neurocytoma not previously recognized.",

HiF-1α was localized to the nuclei in high-grade gliomas, but it was primarily cytosolic in low-grade gliomas and normal human astrocytes. Expression of both glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and MAOB are correlated to HiF-1α expression levels. Levels of MAOB are correlated by the levels of transcription factor Sp3 in the majority of GBM examined, but this control of MAOB expression by Sp3 in low grade astrocytic gliomas is significantly different from control in the in the majority of glioblastomas. The current findings support previous suggestions that MAOB can be exploited for the killing of cancer cells.

We have characterized sphere-cultured glioma-derived cancer-initiating cells (GICs) from experimental gliomas induced by platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) in neonatal Gtv-a Arf(-/-) mice. We found that the GICs can maintain their stem cell-like characteristics in absence of exogenous epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor 2 and that this culture condition was highly selective for tumor-initiating cells where as few as five GICs could induce secondary tumor formation after orthotopic transplantation. Addition of FBS to the medium caused the GICs to differentiate into cells coexpressing glial fibrillary acidic protein and Tuj1, and this differentiation process was reversible, suggesting that the GICs are highly plastic and able to adapt to different environments without losing their tumorigenic properties. On inhibition of virally transduced PDGF-B by small interfering RNA treatment, the GICs stopped proliferating, lost their self-renewal ability, and started to uniformly express CNPase, a marker of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and mature oligodendrocytes. Most importantly, PDGF-B depletion completely abrogated the tumor-initiating capacity of the GICs. Our findings suggest that interfering with PDGF-controlled differentiation could be a therapeutic avenue for patients diagnosed with the PDGF-driven proneural subtype of human glioblastoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"DNA hypermethylation-mediated gene silencing is a frequent and early contributor to aberrant cell growth and invasion in cancer. Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults and the second most common tumor in children. Morbidity and mortality are high in glioma patients because tumors are resistant to treatment and are highly invasive into surrounding brain tissue rendering complete surgical resection impossible. Invasiveness is regulated by the interplay between secreted proteases (eg, cathepsins) and their endogenous inhibitors (cystatins). In our previous studies we identified cystatin E/M (CST6) as a frequent target of epigenetic silencing in glioma. Cystatin E/M is a potent inhibitor of cathepsin B, which is frequently overexpressed in glioma. Here, we study the expression of cystatin E/M in normal brain and show that it is highly and moderately expressed in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, respectively, but not in neurons. Consistent with this, the CST6 promoter is hypomethylated in all normal samples using methylation-specific PCR, bisulfite genomic sequencing, and pyrosequencing. In contrast, 78% of 28 primary brain tumors demonstrated reduced/absent cystatin E/M expression using a tissue microarray and this reduced expression correlated with CST6 promoter hypermethylation. Interestingly, CST6 was expressed in neural stem cells (NSC) and markedly induced upon differentiation, whereas a glioma tumor initiating cell (TIC) line was completely blocked for CST6 expression by promoter methylation. Analysis of primary pediatric brain tumor-derived lines also showed CST6 downregulation and methylation in nearly 100% of 12 cases. Finally, ectopic expression of cystatin E/M in glioma lines reduced cell motility and invasion. These results demonstrate that epigenetic silencing of CST6 is frequent in adult and pediatric brain tumors and occurs in TICs, which are thought to give rise to the tumor. CST6 methylation may therefore represent a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target specifically altered in TICs.",

The anesthetic-induced reversion of the stellated cell shape seems to be mediated by a number of cellular alterations. Central to the effect is most likely a RhoA/Rho-kinase activation, but also the MAPKK/MEK and the Akt/protein kinase B pathway are activated by the anesthetics. With the use of specific inhibitors we were able to show that activation of the MAPKK/MEK pathway inhibits, whereas activation of the Akt/protein kinase B pathway stimulates the reversal of the stellated cell shape by the anesthetics.

With the aim to better understand the resistance/susceptibility processes associated to temozolomide (TMZ) treatment, the current study was performed in three human malignant glioma cell lines by focusing on several levels: (a) apoptotic index and senescence, (b) DNA damage, and (c) interaction of HSPB1 with players of the DNA damage response. Three human glioma cell lines, Gli36, U87, and DBTRG, were treated with TMZ evaluating cell viability and survival, apoptosis, senescence, and comets (comet assay). The expression of HSPA (HSPA1A and HSPA8), HSPB1, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), MLH1, and MSH2 was determined by immunocytochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Western blot. Immunoprecipitation was used to analyze protein interaction. The cell lines exhibited differences in viability, apoptosis, and senescence after TMZ administration. We then focused on Gli36 cells (relatively unstudied) which showed very low recovery capacity following TMZ treatment, and this was related to high DNA damage levels; however, the cells maintained their viability. In these cells, MGMT, MSH2, HSPA, and HSPB1 levels increased significantly after TMZ administration. In addition, MSH2 and HSPB1 proteins appeared co-localized by confocal microscopy. This co-localization increased after TMZ treatment, and in immunoprecipitation analysis, MSH2 and HSPB1 appeared interacting. In contrast, HSPB1 did not interact with MGMT. We show in glioma cells the biological effects of TMZ and how this drug affects the expression levels of heat shock proteins (HSPs), MGMT, MSH2, and MLH1. In Gli36 cells, the results suggest that interactions between HSPB1 and MSH2, including co-nuclear localization, may be important in determining cell sensitivity to TMZ. ",

Expression of PDGFB is thought to be important in the pathogenesis of glioma and several animal models of cerebral glioma based on PDGF expression have been described. To examine whether PDGF could contribute to the pathogenesis of spinal cord glioma, we developed transgenic mice that express hPDGFB under the control of a tetracycline-responsive element (TRE/hPDGFB). These TRE/hPDGFB mice were mated with transgenic mice expressing the tetracycline transcriptional activator (tet-off), tTA, regulated by the human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter and exhibiting uniquely strong promoter activity in the spinal cord. These transgenic mice (GFAP/tTA:TRE/hPDGFB) expressed hPDGFB in GFAP-expressing glia in a manner responsive to doxycycline administration. Without doxycycline, almost all GFAP/tTA:TRE/hPDGFB mice developed spinal cord neoplasms resembling human mixed oligoastrocytoma. Tumorigenesis in these animals was suppressed by doxycycline. To further examine the importance of PDGFB in mouse primary intramedullary spinal cord tumors, we also created transgenic mice expressing hPDGFB under the control of the human GFAP promoter (GFAP/hPDGFB). These GFAP/hPDGFB mice also developed spinal oligoastrocytoma. PDGFB can mediate the development of mouse spinal tumors that are histologically and pathologically indistinguishable from primary intramedullary spinal tumors of humans and may provide opportunities for both novel insights into the pathogenesis of these tumors and the development of new therapeutics.",

Its expression and function in brain tumors are, however, not yet known. In this study, we investigated expression of the bisecting GlcNAc structure in a series of pediatric brain tumors and its relationship to tumor response to vinblastine. A plant lectin (E-PHA) that recognizes the bisecting GlcNAc structure was used for detection of this molecule in a total of 90 pediatric brain tumors and normal brain tissue specimens. Our results showed that, whereas E-PHA staining was undetectable in the normal brain tissue, pediatric brain tumor specimens exhibited different levels of reactivity. Lectin staining was particularly prominent in high-grade astrocytomas (73%) and ependymomas (72%). In astrocytomas, there was a positive correlation with the tumor grade, which suggests that the bisecting GlcNAc may be of particular interest as a tumor marker for diagnosis and/or prognosis. By using a human glioma cell culture model, we have found that treatment of these cells with E-PHA lectin enhances their sensitivity to vinblastine. E-PHA interacted directly with the drug transporter P-glycoprotein and inhibited its drug efflux function. In a drug-resistant glioma cell line transfected with the mdr1 gene, drug resistance was reversed by E-PHA. Our findings indicate that: (a) expression of the bisecting GlcNAc in pediatric brain tumors may have a potential relevance as a tumor marker; and (b) glioma response to chemotherapy may be modulated through the bisecting GlcNAc.",

Since the connectivity and activity of disease modules may shed light on the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis and disease progression, their identification becomes one of the most important challenges in network medicine, an emerging paradigm to study complex human disease. This paper proposes a novel algorithm, DiME (Disease Module Extraction), to identify putative disease modules from biological networks. We have developed novel heuristics to optimise Community Extraction, a module criterion originally proposed for social network analysis, to extract topological core modules from biological networks as putative disease modules. In addition, we have incorporated a statistical significance measure, B-score, to evaluate the quality of extracted modules. As an application to complex diseases, we have employed DiME to investigate the molecular mechanisms that underpin the progression of glioma, the most common type of brain tumour. We have built low (grade II)--and high (GBM)--grade glioma co-expression networks from three independent datasets and then applied DiME to extract potential disease modules from both networks for comparison. Examination of the interconnectivity of the identified modules have revealed changes in topology and module activity (expression) between low- and high- grade tumours, which are characteristic of the major shifts in the constitution and physiology of tumour cells during glioma progression. Our results suggest that transcription factors E2F4, AR and ETS1 are potential key regulators in tumour progression.

This up-regulation in turn promotes angiogenesis and tumor progression. Posttranscriptional gene regulation has been implicated as one mechanism for this tumor response, and we have previously shown that HuR, a protein associated with RNA stabilization, is overexpressed in MGs (L. B. Nabors et al., Cancer Res., 61: 2154-2161, 2001). Here, we demonstrate a marked up-regulation (RNA and protein) of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 8, and, to a lesser extent, vascular endothelial growth factor in U251 glioma cells after stimulation with TNF-alpha. RNA kinetic studies indicated that TNF-alpha induced the stabilization of all three transcripts. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrate that the AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3'-untranslated region of these genes significantly contribute to this posttranscriptional regulation. UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation with glioma extracts indicate that HuR binds to all three AREs. When HuR is overexpressed in glioma cells, there is enhanced RNA stabilization of all three angiogenic factor transcripts with a concomitant increase in mRNA and protein expression (up to 7-fold). These findings indicate that TNF-alpha up-regulates angiogenic factor expression in MG cells and that RNA stabilization, via the AREs in the 3'-untranslated region, contributes to this up-regulation.",

CIMP is associated with microsatellite instability but is also found in BRAF mutant microsatellite stable cancers that are associated with poor prognosis. The isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene causes CIMP in glioma due to an activating mutation that produces the 2-hydroxyglutarate oncometabolite. We therefore examined IDH1 alteration as a potential cause of CIMP in colorectal cancer. The IDH1 mutational hotspot was screened in 86 CIMP-positive and 80 CIMP-negative cancers. The entire coding sequence was examined in 81 CIMP-positive colorectal cancers. Forty-seven cancers varying by CIMP-status and IDH1 mutation status were examined using Illumina 450K DNA methylation microarrays. The R132C IDH1 mutation was detected in 4/166 cancers. All IDH1 mutations were in CIMP cancers that were BRAF mutant and microsatellite stable (4/45, 8.9%). Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis identified an IDH1 mutation-like methylation signature in approximately half of the CIMP-positive cancers. IDH1 mutation appears to cause CIMP in a small proportion of BRAF mutant, microsatellite stable colorectal cancers. This study provides a precedent that a single gene mutation may cause CIMP in colorectal cancer, and that this will be associated with a specific epigenetic signature and clinicopathological features.

The median progression-free survival for the two treatment groups, as measured from postradiotherapy registration, was 71.1 months for the DFMO-PCV arm and 37.5 months for the PCV-only arm. Median survival, measured from registration, was 75.8 and 61.1 months, respectively, for the DFMO-PCV and PCV arms. The treatment effect persisted when the AA histology was separated from AO and AOA histologies. This effect persisted even after adjusting for the covariates of age, Karnofsky performance status, and extent of surgery. There was a statistically significant increase in grade 3 adverse events for diarrhea and anemia associated with DFMO-PCV. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events of nausea, ototoxicity, and thrombocytopenia were not significantly increased among groups.;The addition of DFMO to the nitrosourea-based PCV regimen in this Phase III study demonstrated a sustained benefit in survival probabilities for AG patients but not in the corresponding hazard rates. Survival analysis from registration found a DFMO-PCV median survival of 6.3 years (49 of 114 events), whereas that for PCV alone was 5.1 years (55 of 114 events). The hazard function demonstrated a difference over the first 2 years of study (hazard ratio 0.53, P = 0.02) but not after 2 years (hazard ratio 1.06, P = 0.84), supporting the conclusion that DFMO adds to the survival advantage of PCV chemotherapy for AG patients by direct temporal interaction with PCV.",

We found that herbimycin A, a tyrosine protein kinase inhibitor, blocked: 1) LPS/IFN gamma-induced iNOS expression, 2) LPS-induced intranuclear translocation of activated NF-kappa B (p50. p65) and 3) IFN gamma-induced autophosphorylation and activation of Jak 2 and Stat 1 as well as intranuclear translocation of phosphorylated Stat 1. Furthermore, transfection of a dominant negative form of I kappa B alpha (SS-->AA) suppressed LPS/IFN gamma-induced iNOS expression, suggesting that NF-kappa B, in particular, I kappa B alpha molecules could play important roles in the iNOS expression. We also found in IL-1 beta-induced CINC expression using cultured C6 glioma cells, the transient translocation of NF-kappa B in response to IL-1 beta is partly dependent on transient proteasome activation. Thus we suggest that the formation of heterodimer p50.p65 from inactive trimer p50.p65.I kappa B alpha, particularly, proteolytic degradation and dissociation of I kappa B alpha from p50.p65 are a critical phase in NF-kappa B activation during LPS-induced iNOS and IL-1 beta-induced CINC expression in astroglial cells.",

Our results show that patients as a whole were efficient at most tasks; however, the patients exhibited difficulties in the productive picture-naming task, the receptive verbal judgment task, and the visual/graphic portion of the dual-attention task.

This phosphorylation inhibits the binding of effector Raf while promoting the engagement of GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and GTP hydrolysis. Here we identify SHP2 as the ubiquitously expressed tyrosine phosphatase that preferentially binds to and dephosphorylates Ras to increase its association with Raf and activate downstream proliferative Ras/ERK/MAPK signalling. In comparison to normal astrocytes, SHP2 activity is elevated in astrocytes isolated from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)-prone H-Ras(12V) knock-in mice as well as in glioma cell lines and patient-derived GBM specimens exhibiting hyperactive Ras. Pharmacologic inhibition of SHP2 activity attenuates cell proliferation, soft-agar colony formation and orthotopic GBM growth in NOD/SCID mice and decelerates the progression of low-grade astrocytoma to GBM in a spontaneous transgenic glioma mouse model. These results identify SHP2 as a direct activator of Ras and a potential therapeutic target for cancers driven by a previously 'undruggable' oncogenic or hyperactive Ras. ",

Aims of the study are: (1) to evaluate the modifications of fiber trajectory induced by the tumor; (2) to validate preoperative DTI-FT results with intraoperative identification of functional subcortical sites through direct subcortical stimulation; (3) to evaluate the impact of preoperative DTI-FT reconstructions in a neuronavigational setup combined with ISM technique on duration and modalities of surgical procedures, and on functional outcome of the patients. Data are available on 64 patients (52 low-grade and 12 high-grade gliomas). DTI-FT was acquired by a 3-T MR scanner with a single-shot EPI sequence (TR/TE 8986/80 ms, b=1000 s/mm) with gradients applied along 32 non-collinear directions. 3D Fast Field Echo (FFE) T1-weighted imaging (TR/TE 8/4 ms) was performed for anatomic guidance. The corticospinal tract (CST), superior longitudinal, inferior fronto-occipital and uncinatus fasciculi were reconstructed. Data were transferred to the neuronavigational system. Functional subcortical sites identified during ISM were correlated with fiber tracts depicted by DTI-FT. In high-grade gliomas, DTI-FT depicted tracts mostly at the tumor periphery; in low-grade gliomas, fibers were frequently located inside the tumor mass. There was a high correlation between DTI-FT and ISM (sensitivity for CST=95%, language tracts=97%). For a proper reconstruction of the tracts, it was necessary to use a low FA threshold of fiber tracking algorithm and to position additional regions of interest (ROIs). The combination of DTI-FT and ISM decreased the duration of surgery, patient fatigue, and intraoperative seizures. Combination of DTI-FT and ISM allows accurate identification of eloquent fiber tracts and enhances surgical performance and safety maintaining a high rate of functional preservation.",

Six of the cell lines showed upregulation of secretion of both enzymes by all six gangliosides. Of the remaining two cell lines, one showed inhibition of MMP secretion by all gangliosides and the other had a small but differential response to the range of gangliosides investigated.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the efficacy of boronated epidermal growth factor (EGF) either alone or in combination with boronophenylalanine (BPA) as delivery agents for an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -positive glioma, designated F98(EGFR). A heavily boronated precision macromolecule [boronated starburst dendrimer (BSD)] was chemically linked to EGF by heterobifunctional reagents. Either F98 wild-type (F98(WT)) receptor (-) or EGFR gene-transfected F98(EGFR) cells, which expressed 5 x 10(5) receptor sites/cell, were stereotactically implanted into the brains of Fischer rats, and 2 weeks later biodistribution studies were initiated. For biodistribution studies rats received an intratumoral (i.t.) injection of (125)I-labeled BSD-EGF and were euthanized either 6 or 24 h later. At 6 h, equivalent amounts of BSD-EGF were detected in F98(EGFR) and F98(WT) tumors. Persistence of the bioconjugate in F98(EGFR) tumors was specifically determined by EGFR expression. By 24 h 33.2% of injected dose/g of EGF-BSD was retained by F98(EGFR) gliomas compared with 9.4% % of injected dose/g in F98(WT) gliomas, and the corresponding boron concentrations were 21.1 microg/g and 9.2 microg/g, respectively. Boron concentrations in normal brain, blood, liver, kidneys, and spleen all were at nondetectable levels (<0.5 microg/g). On the basis of these results, BNCT was initiated at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Medical Research Reactor. Two weeks after implantation of 10(3) F98(EGFR) or F98(WT) tumor cells, rats received an i.t. injection of BSD-EGF (approximately 60 microg (10)B/approximately 15 microg EGF) either alone or in combination with i.v. BPA (500 mg/kg). Rats were irradiated at the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor 24 h after i.t. injection, which was timed to coincide with 2.5 h after i.v. injection of BPA for those animals that received both capture agents. Untreated control rats had a mean survival time (MST) +/- SE of 27 +/- 1 day, and irradiated controls had a MST of 31 +/- 1 day. Animals bearing F98(EGFR) gliomas, which had received i.t.

BPA had a MST of 57 +/- 8 days compared with 39 +/- 2 days for i.v. BPA alone (P = 0.016).

In particular, we report that TMZ and BCNU induce clustering of pericentromeric heterochromatin regions and increase the amount of heterochromatic proteins MeCP2 and HP1alpha bound to chromatin. These drugs also decrease global levels of histone H3 acetylation and increase levels of histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 9 (H3-triMeK9). These events precede the senescence status.

Here, we present an immunohistochemical analysis of the expression pattern of ET-1 receptor subtypes (ET(A)-R and ET(B)-R) and a functional study of their potential role in human oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas. By comparison, we assessed the corresponding expression patterns of glioblastomas. Interestingly, a nuclear localization of ET-1 receptor subtypes (associated or not with a cytoplasmic labeling) was constantly observed in tumor cells from all three glioma types. Moreover, we noted a distinct receptor distribution in the different gliomas: a nuclear expression of ET(B)-R by tumor cells was found to be restricted to oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas, while a nuclear expression of ET(A)-R was only detected in tumor cells from some glioblastomas. Using primary cultures of oligodendroglial tumor cells, we confirmed the selective expression of nuclear ET(B)-R, together with a plasma membrane expression, and further demonstrated that this receptor was functionally coupled to intracellular signaling pathways known to be involved in cell survival and/or proliferation: extracellular signal-regulated kinase and focal adhesion kinase activation, actin cytoskeleton reorganization. In addition, impairment of ET(B)-R activation in these cells by in vitro treatment with an ET(B)-R-specific antagonist induced cell death. These data point to ET-1 as a possible survival factor for oligodendrogliomas via ET(B)-R activation and suggest that ET(B)-R-specific antagonists might constitute a potential therapeutic alternative for oligodendrogliomas.",

This should enable BNCT to reduce damage to normal tissues compared with other radiation therapies.;To augment the therapeutic efficacy of BNCT, we used transferrin-conjugated polyethylene glycol (PEG) (TF-PEG) liposome encapsulating sodium borocaptate and Iomeprol, an iodine contrast agent, with intratumoral convection-enhanced delivery (CED) in a rat glioma tumor model.;The in vitro (10)B concentration of F98 rat glioma cells was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry after incubation with either TF-PEG or PEG liposomes.

        "Doc_abstract":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and highly aggressive type of primary brain tumor. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) secrete TNF-α that activates important survival pathways including Akt (PKB)/mTOR network. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) network functions downstream of PI3K/Akt pathway to regulate cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTOR exists in two distinct complexes-mTORC1 and mTORC2 that differ in their components and sensitivity to rapamycin. The rapamycin-insensitive complex (mTORC2) consists of mTOR, mLST8, Rictor, mSin1 and Protor and regulates the actin cytoskeleton in addition to activating Akt (protein kinase B). The present study aimed to investigate the role of Rictor-a core component of mTORC2 in regulating proliferation, survival, and invasion in gliomas. siRNA-mediated loss of Rictor function in human glioma cell lines, LN18 and LN229 and in primary GBM cells resulted in elevated expression and activity of MMP-9 and significant increase in the invasive potential of these cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that the activation of Raf-1-MEK-ERK pathway was essential for induction of MMP-9 activity and enhanced invasion. Interestingly, ablation of Rictor did not affect TNF-α-induced MMP-9 activity and invasiveness suggesting that TNF-α in the microenvironment of tumor might overrule the function of Rictor as a negative regulator of MMP-9 and invasion. Silencing Rictor had no effect on the survival or proliferation in the cell lines in the presence or absence of TNF-α. Our findings identify a role for Rictor in bridging two major pathways-Akt (PKB)/mTOR and Raf-1-MEK-ERK in regulating MMP-9 activity and invasion of glioma tumor cells.",

In this study, the human glioblastoma cell line U87 was stably transfected with a lentivirus vector expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting AKT2. Knockdown of AKT2 by the shRNA inhibited U87 cell proliferation and increased the rate of apoptosis. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis revealed that cells stably underexpressing AKT2 showed lower expression of the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and enhanced expression of the apoptosis effector caspase-3 compared to U87 cells stably transfected with a control vector. Furthermore, expression levels of AKT2 were correlated with the IC50 of the antitumor drug VM-26 (teniposide); the VM-26 IC50 was reduced from 6.46±0.42μg/ml in control glioma cells to 1.15±0.22μg/ml in U87 cells underexpressing AKT2. Combined AKT2 knockdown and VM-26 treatment inhibited cell proliferation in vitro more effectively than either treatment alone. Knockdown of AKT2 expression was associated with decreased expression of the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) without affecting MRP1 mRNA expression. However, the mRNA and protein levels of MDR1 (p-glycoprotein) were unaffected by AKT2 knockdown. These results indicate that inhibition of AKT2 expression may be an effective means for overcoming AKT2-associated chemoresistance in human malignant glioma cells and may represent a potential gene-targeting approach to treat glioma.",

We determined the effect of AG3340, a novel synthetic MMP inhibitor with Ki values against gelatinases in the low picomolar range, on the growth of a human malignant glioma cell line (U87) in SCID-NOD mice. Mice were injected s.c. with U87 cells. Tumors were allowed to grow to a size of approximately 0.5 x 0.5 cm (after about 3 weeks), and the mice were randomized to receive either: (a) 100 mg/kg AG3340 in vehicle; or (b) vehicle control (0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose, 0.1% pluronic F68), both given daily i.p. Tumor area was measured twice weekly, and animals were sacrificed when moribund, or earlier if premorbid histology was examined. In vivo inhibition of tumor growth was profound, with AG3340 decreasing tumor size by 78% compared with controls after 31 days (when controls were sacrificed; P < 0.01, Wilcoxon test). Control animals survived 31 days after the i.p. injections began, and AG3340 mice survived 71 days, representing a >2-fold increase in survival associated with tumor growth delay. Histological examination found that AG3340-treated tumors were smaller, had lower rates of proliferation, and significantly less invasion than control-treated tumors. Hepatic or pulmonary metastases were not seen in either group. In a separate experiment, the tumors were smaller and sampled after a shorter duration of treatment; the changes in proliferation were more marked and occurred earlier than differences in tumor invasion between the two groups. Furthermore, in vitro cell growth was not inhibited at AG3340 concentrations of <1 mM. AG3340 plasma concentrations in vivo, 1 h after administration, ranged from 67 to 365 nM. Thus, AG3340 produced a profound inhibition of glioma tumor growth and invasion. AG3340 markedly increased survival in this in vivo glioma model.

Deregulation of the G1 phase cell cycle machinery is a common feature of cancers. p27(Kip1) (p27) is one of the major cyclin-CDK regulators in the G1 phase. uPAR and cathepsin B downregulation was recently shown to induce p27 expression through PI3K/Akt/FOXO3a signaling. Since uPAR and cathepsin B knockdown also decreased phosphorylation of ERK, we hypothesized that ERK also has a role to play in p27 induction. As induction of p27 is due to an increase in gene transcription, we investigated the roles of c-Myc and E2F1 transcription factors which have been shown to potently affect p27 promoter activity. In the present study, shRNA against cathepsin B and uPAR as well as specific inhibitors, Wortmannin (10 μM) and U0126 (10 μM), were used to determine the roles of AKT and ERK signaling on p27 expression. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that downregulation of both p-ERK and p-AKT downstream of EGFR and β1 integrin are involved in the p27 upregulation. Cathepsin B and uPAR downregulation induced E2F1 and decreased phosphorylaion of pocket proteins and c-Myc expression. CHIP analysis and luciferase expression studies confirmed the functional association of transcription factor E2F1 to the p27 promoter. Further, c-Myc-Max interaction inhibitor studies showed an inverse pattern of c-Myc and p27 expression. Also, cathepsin B and uPAR downregulation reduced tumor growth and increased p27 nuclear expression in vivo. In summary, cathepsin B and uPAR downregulation reduced p-ERK levels and c-Myc expression, increased expression of E2F1 and FOXO3a, decreased phosphorylation of pocket proteins and thus upregulated p27 expression in glioma cells.",

Ninety MRI studies were performed of 18 patients with malignant glioma before and 6, 18, 26, 52, and 72 weeks after the end of stereotactic radiotherapy. The signal time courses of the contrast-enhanced tumors were analyzed using a pharmacokinetic two-compartment model that calculates for the parameter A, reflecting the degree of MRI signal enhancement [no units] and the exchange rate constant k21 [min(-1)]. Before radiotherapy, the amplitude A was significantly (P < .05) lower in patients with subsequent local tumor control (n = 8; mean A = .34 +/- .15) compared to patients without subsequent local tumor control (n = 10; mean A = .94 +/- .71). In the local tumor control group, early after stereotactic radiotherapy (at 6-18 weeks), there was a significant (P < .05) time-dependent decrease in the parameter k21, whereas there was still no alteration in the tumor volume. A low amplitude A before radiotherapy, combined with an early drop of k21 after stereotactic radiotherapy, reliably characterized the group of patients with subsequent tumor volume decrease. Our preliminary results suggest that two contrast-enhanced dynamic MR studies, one before and one early after stereotactic radiotherapy, offer important information on local tumor control within the first 6 to 18 weeks after stereotactic radiotherapy. Moreover, this response may be evidenced before tumor volume changes and provides a therapeutic window to broaden treatment options and to improve treatment outcome.",

We previously demonstrated that SPARC promotes glioma migration and invasion-in part, by activating the P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-heat shock protein (HSP)27 signaling pathway. The commonly lost tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) suppresses SPARC-induced migration, which is accompanied by suppression of Shc-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 and Akt signaling. As PTEN completely suppresses SPARC-induced migration, we proposed that PTEN must also interfere with SPARC-induced HSP27 signaling. Therefore, this study determined the effects of PTEN expression on SPARC-induced expression and phosphorylation of HSP27.;Control and SPARC-expressing clones transfected with control- or PTEN-expression plasmids were plated on fibronectin-coated tissue culture plates for 3, 6, 24, and 48 h and then lysed. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to Western blot and densitometric analyses.;The results show that SPARC enhances phosphorylated (p)P38 MAPK, phosphorylated MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (pMAPKAPK2), and serine (Ser)78 HSP27 phosphorylation relative to total HSP27. PTEN suppresses pAkt and pMAPKAPK2, suggesting that PTEN effects are downstream of pP38 MAPK. PTEN suppressed SPARC-induced sustained phosphorylation at Ser78 HSP27. As the level of total HSP27 differed based on the presence of SPARC or PTEN, the ratios of phosphorylation-specific to total HSP27 were examined. The data demonstrate that SPARC-induced phosphorylation at Ser78 remains elevated despite increasing levels of total HSP27. In contrast, PTEN inhibits SPARC-induced increases in Ser78 HSP27 phosphorylation relative to total HSP27.;These data describe a novel mechanism whereby PTEN inhibits SPARC-induced migration through suppression and differential regulation of pAkt and the P38 MAPK-MAPKAPK2-HSP27 signaling pathway.",

The present study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of (11)C-4DST PET in the diagnosis of human brain gliomas by comparing with the images of (18)F-FLT PET.;Twenty patients with primary and recurrent brain gliomas underwent (18)F-FLT and (11)C-4DST PET scans. The uptake values in the tumors were evaluated using the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), the tumor-to-normal tissue uptake (T/N) ratio, and the tumor-to-blood uptake (T/B) ratio. These values were compared among different glioma grades. Correlation between the Ki-67 labeling index and the uptake values of (11)C-4DST and (18)F-FLT in the tumor was evaluated using linear regression analysis. The relationship between the individual (18)F-FLT and (11)C-4DST uptake values in the tumors was also examined.;(11)C-4DST uptake was significantly higher than that of (18)F-FLT in the normal brain.

No significant differences in the uptake values of (18)F-FLT and (11)C-4DST were noted among different glioma grades. Linear regression analysis showed a significant correlation between the Ki-67 labeling index and the T/N ratio of (11)C-4DST (r = 0.50, P < 0.05) and (18)F-FLT (r = 0.50, P < 0.05).

In recent years, several authors showed the benefit of intraoperative ultrasound partially matched with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of this study was to find out if intraoperative neuronavigation in combination with intraoperative ultrasound has any impact on the complete resection of gliomas. A comparison between the ultrasound-controlled resection of brain tumors and operations controlled by navigated ultrasound was performed.;A total of 92 patients (54 men and 39 women) with a mean age of 53.2 years underwent 93 operations over a period of 4 years (2007-2010). They harbored a tumor with suspicion of glioma; 32 of them had undergone previous surgery, and additional chemotherapy, and 29 of them had undergone irradiation. Overall, 49 operations were performed with navigated ultrasound (group A) and 44 with non-navigated ultrasound (group B). A standardized early postoperative MRI was performed . Complete or gross total resection (GTR) was defined by a resection of ≥ 95% of the tumor. Skin incision and craniotomy were planned after registration of the neuronavigation system. The ultrasound system was used systematically before and after opening the dura, and during and at the end of resection.;GTR could be achieved in 28 of 49 cases in group A and in 23 of 44 cases in group B. In group A, sensitivity and specificity of tumor remnants detected by ultrasound were higher than in group B. Concerning recurrent gliomas, the sensitivity of ultrasound visualizing tumor remnants was lower than in primary tumors. In case of preoperatively planned GTR, in both groups (navigated and non-navigated ultrasound) similar tumor remnant sizes were postoperatively detected by MRI. In nine cases the removal was incomplete because of eloquently located tumors. There was no significant difference between navigated and not-navigated ultrasound concerning GTR (p > 0.05).;Navigated ultrasound is an important technical tool that helps in intraoperative orientation. Further prospective investigation is needed to assess the impact on GTR.",

Muscimol, a selective gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor agonist, but not (-)-baclofen, a selective gamma-aminobutyric acid B receptor agonist, stimulates [14C]arachidonate release from C6 cells as a result of hydrolysis of a small pool of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine by phospholipase A2. This release is facilitated by diazepam and a number of other benzodiazepines such as flunitrazepam, medazepam and midazolam (but very little by clonazepam), although these benzodiazepines per se are inactive in causing the release. In addition to increasing the release of [14C]arachidonate, diazepam in the presence of muscimol promotes the release of [14C] prostaglandin D2. Bicuculline inhibits the action of muscimol and facilitation by diazepam. \"Peripheral\" benzodiazepine ligand, RO 5-4864 (4'-chlordiazepam) antagonizes the action of diazepam, whereas \"central\" ligand, RO 15-1788, is inactive. The release of arachidonate metabolites stimulated by muscimol and diazepam is unaffected by Cl- channel blockers, picrotoxin and pentylenetetrazol. Based on these results we propose that in glioma C6 cells (and presumably in normal glia) peripheral benzodiazepine receptor interacts functionally with gamma-aminobutyric acid A type of receptor, which appears not to be linked to picrotoxin sensitive Cl- channel, and may be linked to phospholipase A2.",

Recently, nonapoptotic cell death, or autophagy, has been revealed as a novel response of cancer cells to ionizing radiation. In the present study, the authors analyzed the effect of pitavastatin as a potential inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation on the radiosensitivity of A172, U87, and U251 human glioma cell lines.;The pharmacological inhibition of NF-kappaB activation was achieved using pitavastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. Growth and radiosensitivity assays were performed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Hoechst 33258 staining, supravital acridine orange staining, and electron microscopy were performed utilizing 3 glioma cell lines with or without pitavastatin pretreatment to identify apoptosis or autophagy after irradiation.;The growth of these 3 glioma cell lines was not significantly inhibited by pitavastatin at a concentration of up to 1 microM. Treatment with 0.1 microM of pitavastatin enhanced radiation-induced cell death in all glioma cell lines, with different sensitivity. Apoptosis did not occur in any pretreated or untreated (no pitavastatin) cell line following irradiation. Instead, autophagic cell changes were observed regardless of the radiosensitivity of the cell line. An inhibitor of autophagy, 3-methyladenine suppressed the cytotoxic effect of irradiation with pitavastatin, indicating that autophagy is a result of an antitumor mechanism. Using the most radiosensitive A172 cell line, the intracellular localization of p50, a representative subunit of NF-kappaB, was evaluated through immunoblotting and immunofluorescence studies. The NF-kappaB of A172 cells was immediately activated and translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus in response to irradiation. Pitavastatin inhibited this activation and translocation of NF-kappaB.;Autophagic cell death rather than apoptosis is a possible mechanism of radiation-induced and pitavastatin-enhanced cell damage, and radiosensitization by the pharmacological inhibition of NF-kappaB activation may be a novel therapeutic strategy for malignant gliomas.",

However, few options are effective for patients who experience treatment failure. We conducted a multicenter, phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of continuous dose-intense TMZ for recurrent GBM. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with malignant glioma at progression after standard TMZ 150 to 200 mg/m(2) x 5 days in a 28-day cycle for three or more cycles were stratified by tumor type (anaplastic glioma group A, GBM, group B). Ninety-one patients with GBM were prospectively divided into three groups (early [B1], extended [B2], and rechallenge [B3]) according to the timing of progression during adjuvant therapy. All patients received continuous dose-intense TMZ 50 mg/m(2)/d for up to 1 year or until progression occurred. Response was assessed by using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). Results A total of 116 of 120 patients were evaluable for efficacy. For patients with GBM, 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 23.9% (B1, 27.3%; B2, 7.4%; B3, 35.7%). One-year survival from time of study entry was 27.3%, 14.8%, and 28.6% for the B1, B2 and B3 groups, respectively. For patients with anaplastic glioma, 6-month PFS was 35.7%; 1-year survival was 60.7%. The most common grades 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities were nausea/vomiting (6.7%) and fatigue (5.8%). Grades 3 and 4 hematologic toxicities were uncommon. CONCLUSION Rechallenge with continuous dose-intense TMZ 50 mg/m(2)/d is a valuable therapeutic option for patients with recurrent GBM. Patients who experience progression during the first six cycles of conventional adjuvant TMZ therapy or after a treatment-free interval get the most benefit from therapy.",

Glutamate receptor subunit B is nearly 100% edited at one position (the Q/R-site), which is essential for normal receptor function. Its significance is apparent from mouse models in which a slightly reduced rate of Q/R-site editing is associated with early onset epilepsy and premature death. Here we report that in tissues from malignant human brain tumors, this editing position of glutamate receptor subunit B is substantially underedited compared with control tissues. We also observe alterations in editing and alternative splicing of serotonin receptor 5-HT(2C) transcripts. These changes correlate with a decrease in enzymatic activity of the editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) 2, as deduced from analysis of ADAR2 self-editing. Our results suggest a role for RNA editing in tumor progression and may provide a molecular model explaining the occurrence of epileptic seizures in association with malignant gliomas.",

The Ad-uPAR-Cath B-infected cells revealed a marked reduction in tumor growth and invasiveness as compared with the parental and vector controls.

Furthermore, using a near infrared fluorescence probe, in vivo imaging for cathepsin B indicated low/undetectable levels of fluorescence after injection of the Ad-uPAR-Cath B construct into pre-established s.c. tumors as compared with Ad-CMV-treated and untreated tumors. The effect with bicistronic construct (Ad-uPAR-Cath B) was much higher than with single (Ad-uPAR/Ad-Cath B) constructs.

Schedule A patients received irinotecan weekly (125 mg/m(2)/w) for four out of six weeks. Schedule B patients received irinotecan every three weeks at a dose of 300 mg/m(2). A 20% dose reduction was implemented for patients who had received prior nitrosureas. Treatment was continued until unacceptable toxicity, tumor progression or patient withdrawal.;There was no difference in confirmed responses between the two groups (6.3%). PFS at 6 months was 6.25% (2/32 patients) on schedule A and 18.75% (6/32 patients) on schedule B but median OS (5.1 versus 5.5 months), and survival at one year (19%) was similar for both arms. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities on schedules A/B were: thrombocytopenia (15.6%/21.9%), diarrhea (6.3%/12.5%) and nausea and vomiting (0%/15.7%). One toxic death due to infection in the absence of neutropenia occurred in schedule B. EIAEDs reduced SN-38 and CPT-11 area under the curve and increased CPT-11 clearance. This effect was more prominent in schedule A patients. Steroids did not alter CPT-11 pharmacokinetics in either schedule.;Single agent irinotecan has modest activity in patients with recurrent gliomas, independently of the administration schedule. Irinotecan administration on an every 3 week schedule resulted in longer PFS-6, at the expense of more toxicity. EIAEDs alter CPT-11 pharmacokinetics in this group of patients, and should be taken into consideration when determining optimal dosing.",

However, recent evidences have suggested that tumor cells may evade the immune system and exploit inflammatory responses to enhance its own growth. An exemplary example is the highly invasive and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha-resistant glioblastoma, whose growth is associated with TNFalpha expression. We thus examined whether the tumor takes advantage of TNFalpha overexpression to enhance its invasiveness. To delineate the contribution of inflammation in tumor migration, we demonstrated that the role of proinflammatory cytokines on matrix metalloproteinases-3 (MMP-3) expression, and its consequent effects on the invasiveness of a human glioma cell-line, T98G. By using Matrigel Invasion Chamber, T98G cell migration was significantly enhanced in response to TNFalpha. In contrast, interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) reduced both basal and TNFalpha-enhanced cell invasion. To investigate the mechanisms involved, we demonstrated that TNFalpha upregulated mRNA and protein expression of MMP-3 in T98G cells, whereas IFN gamma downregulated the MMP-3 expression. The role of MMP-3 in glioma invasiveness was further confirmed by transfecting MMP-3 siRNA in T98G to abrogate the TNFalpha-enhanced cell invasion. To delineate the mechanisms further, we showed that IFN gamma exerts an inhibitory effect on the binding of TNFalpha-activated Ets-1 and NF kappa B to their respective enhancer elements found in MMP-3 promoter. In summary, our results indicated that TNFalpha enhances the invasiveness of T98G glioma cells through MMP-3 induction, and such enhancement of cell migration can be inhibited by IFN gamma.",

Boron-10 is known to accumulate selectively only in brain tumor cells. This work was aimed to clarify the subcellular biodistribution of BSH in a rat glioma model using immunohistochemical approach. Wistar rats were used for this experiment. An intracerebral injection of 5.0 x 10(6) C6 glioma cells was introduced into the region of cerebral hemisphere. Fifty milligrams of \"'B/kg BSH was infused intravenously two weeks after implantation. Host rats were divided into six groups according to the sampling time: 1, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 h after the start of BSH infusion. Immunohistochemical study was carried out using anti-BSH antibody. Boron was already found in a whole cell 1 h after BSH infusion, and then seemed to collect in a cell nuclei around 8-16 h after infusion. It was still recognized in tumor cell 48 h after infusion. This study supports the following hypothesis on selective boron uptake in a tumor. BSH can pass through the disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB) easily and can come in contact with tumor cells; there, BSH can bind on the extracellular surface of plasma membrane to choline residues. After binding to the plasma membrane, boron with choline residues may be internalized into the cell by endocytic pathways and eventually travel to cell nuclei, and then stay there for a long time.",

Tumor-specific effector cells were detected in the spleens harvested from animals bearing 17-day, regressing, T9.F/IL6/hi tumors. In vitro, these effector cells lysed T9.F cells, proliferated in response to T9.F stimulator cells, and produced Th1 cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) but not the Th2 cytokine, IL-4, when cocultured with T9.F stimulator cells. Rats that had rejected s.c. T9.F/IL6/hi tumors displayed a delayed-type hypersensitivity response when injected with viable T9.F cells in the contralateral flank.

Here, 11,000- gene microarray was used to identify gene expression profiles in brain tumors including high-grade gliomas [glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma], low-grade astrocytomas, or benign extra-axial brain tumors (meningioma) in comparison with normal brain tissue. Histologically normal tissues adjacent to GBMs were also studied. All GBMs studied overexpressed 14 known genes compared with normal human brain tissue. Overexpressed genes belonged to two broad groups: (a) growth factor-related genes; and (b) structural/extracellular matrix-related genes. For most of these 14 genes, expression levels were lower in low-grade astrocytoma than in GBM and were barely detectable in normal brain. Despite normal-appearing histology, gene expression patterns of tissues immediately adjacent to GBM were similar to those of their respective primary GBMs. Two genes were consistently up-regulated in both high-grade and low-grade gliomas, as well as in histologically normal tissues adjacent to GBMs. These genes coded for the epidermal growth factor receptor (previously reported to be overexpressed in gliomas) and for the alpha4 chain of laminin, a major blood vessel basement membrane component. Changes in expression of this laminin chain have not been previously associated with malignant tumors. Overexpression of laminin alpha4 chain in GBM and astrocytoma grade II by gene microarray analysis was confirmed by semiquantitive reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Importantly, an alpha4 chain-containing laminin isoform, laminin-8 (alpha4beta1gamma1), was expressed mainly in blood vessel walls of GBMs and histologically normal tissues adjacent to GBMs, whereas another alpha4 chain-containing laminin isoform, laminin-9 (alpha4beta2gamma1), was expressed mainly in blood vessel walls of low-grade tumors and normal brain. GBMs that overexpressed laminin-8 had a shorter mean time to tumor recurrence (4.3 months) than GBMs with overexpression of laminin-9 (9.7 months, P = 0.0007). Up-regulation of alpha4 chain-containing laminins could be important for the development of glioma-induced neovascularization and glial tumor progression. Overexpression of laminin-8 may be predictive of glioma recurrence.",

In this study, we have investigated 6-OHDA-induced nitrosative cell death and its self-defense mechanism in C6 glioma cells. Treatment of C6 cells with 6-OHDA increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and subsequent production of nitric oxide (NO). Furthermore 6-OHDA treatment led to peroxynitrite generation and nitrotyrosine formation. 6-OHDA-induced nitrosative stress ultimately caused apoptotic cell death as determined by decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio, activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), which were attenuated by peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)prophyrinato iron(III) (FeTPPS). In another experiment, exposure of C6 glioma cells to 6-OHDA resulted in an increased expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and 6-OHDA-induced cytotoxicity was effectively suppressed by the HO-1 inducer SnCl(2) and aggravated by HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP), supporting the cytoprotective role of HO-1. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying 6-OHDA-mediated HO-1 induction, we have examined the possible involvement of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of phase II detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes. 6-OHDA treatment increased nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of Nrf2, which seemed to be partly mediated by activation of upstream kinases such as Akt/protein kinase B (PKB). Taken together these findings suggest that HO-1 up-regulation via Nrf2 activation may mediate the cellular adaptive survival response to 6-OHDA-induced nitrosative cell death in C6 glioma cells.",

The three major KIAA1549:BRAF fusion subtypes were analysed by reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in a subset of 47 frozen cases and by fluorescence in situ hybridization on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue in 23 cases. Tumour location, age at surgery, extent of surgical removal, histological subtype and KIAA1549:BRAF fusion by RT-PCR were searched for prognostic significance.;Pilomyxoid astrocytoma (PMA) and the hypothalamo-chiasmatic (H/C) location were associated with a worse prognosis [P < 0.001 for overall survival (OS) and P = 0.001 for progression-free survival (PFS)]. Patients who underwent complete surgical excision had a better OS (P = 0.004) and a longer PFS (P < 0.001) than the others. Age was also a strong prognostic factor for OS but not for PFS.

        "Doc_abstract":"Human astrocytomas frequently co-express Fas (APO-1/CD95) and Fas ligand (FasL), yet do not appear to be overly susceptible to suicidal, fratricidal and immune-mediated elimination. This suggests that these gliomas have acquired mechanisms to prevent Fas-mediated apoptosis from occurring. Candidates for such a role include transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGFbeta2) and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2). TGFbeta2 effectively functions by hiding tumor cells from the immune system. This may potentially prevent the delivery of FasL from cytolytic T cells to Fas bearing astrocytomas. Bcl-2 works by rendering gliomas resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed seventy-six human astrocytomas (11 World Health Organization (WHO) grade I, 17 grade II, 17 grade III, and 31 grade IV) for the expression of Fas, FasL, TGFbeta2 and Bcl-2 in vivo. Positive immunoreactivity was found to significantly increase with increasing tumor grade for Fas (p < 0.0002), FasL (p < 0.0001), TGFbeta2 (p < 0.001) and Bcl-2 (p < 0.01). In addition, Fas/FasL co-expression, a counter-intuitive combination of factors in regards to glioma survival, also increased with WHO grade. Forty-five of 76 (59%) astrocytomas co-expressed Fas and FasL. Of those co-expressing Fas and FasL, 44 of 45 (98%) produced TGFbeta2, and 26 of 45 (58%) expressed Bcl-2. We found a significant positive correlation between Fas/FasL co-expression and TGFbeta2 (p < 0.002) and Bcl-2 (p < 0.005) production. We conclude that Fas and FasL are frequently co-expressed in human astrocytomas and these tumors are likely to produce other immunosuppressive and antiapoptotic factors such as TGFbeta2 and Bcl-2.",

Comparison of two alternative treatments of cultured C6 (p53(+)) and 9L (p53(-)) rat glioma cells showed significantly reduced survival for both cell lines, especially 9L, when radiation was applied prior to virus versus radiation alone. High p53 protein expression mediated by VV-TK-p53 was measured in infected cells. Single modality treatment of C6 cells with psoralen and UV (PUV)-inactivated VV-TK-p53 (PUV-VV-TK-53) or radiation significantly decreased survival compared with PUV-inactivated L-15 (PUV-L-15) control virus. However, no difference was observed between radiation and combination treatments of C6 cells. In contrast, radiation followed by PUV-VV-TK-53 resulted in dramatic reduction of 9L cell viability, compared to single modality treatment. Flow cytometry analysis of Annexin-V-stained 9L cells showed that radiation and PUV-VV-TK-53 caused a significant decrease in live cells (17.2%) as compared to other treatments and control (61.6-98.3%). Apoptosis was observed in 37.2% of cells, while the range was 0.7-7.8% in other treatment groups; maximal p53 level was measured on day 7 post-infection. In athymic mice bearing C6 tumors, VV-TK-53 plus radiation in both single and multiple therapies resulted in significantly smaller tumors by day 30 compared to the agents given only once. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections demonstrated p53 protein expression over 20 days after VV-TK-53 treatment. Analysis of blood and spleen cells of mice given multiple combination treatments showed significant splenomegaly, leukocytosis, and increased DNA synthesis and response to mitogen. Multiple combination treatments were also associated with significantly elevated natural killer and B cells in the spleen. There were no overt toxicities, although depression in red blood cell and thrombocyte parameters was noted. Collectively, the data demonstrate that radiation significantly improves the efficacy of VV-mediated tumor suppressor p53 therapy and may be a promising strategy for glioma treatment. Furthermore, the results support the conclusion that the mechanisms underlying the enhanced anti-tumor effect of combination treatment include apoptosis/necrosis and upregulation of innate immune defenses.",

Flow cytometric analyses were carried out to measure the cell-cycle, apoptosis, and mitotic index. Mitotic catastrophe was detected by immunofluorescence. The efficacy of NVP-BKM120 was tested using intracranial U87 glioma model.;We tested the biologic effects of a selective PI3K inhibitor NVP-BKM120 in a set of glioma cell lines. NVP-BKM120 treatment for 72 hours resulted in a dose-dependent growth inhibition and effectively blocked the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade. Although we found no obvious relationship between the cell line's sensitivity to NVP-BKM120 and the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) statuses, we did observe a differential sensitivity pattern with respect to p53 status, with glioma cells containing wild-type p53 more sensitive than cells with mutated or deleted p53. NVP-BKM120 showed differential forms of cell death on the basis of p53 status of the cells with p53 wild-type cells undergoing apoptotic cell death and p53 mutant/deleted cells having a mitotic catastrophe cell death. NVP-BKM120 mediates mitotic catastrophe mainly through Aurora B kinase. Knockdown of p53 in p53 wild-type U87 glioma cells displayed microtubule misalignment, multiple centrosomes, and mitotic catastrophe cell death.

        "Doc_abstract":"We have recently shown that endothelin-1 activates two types of Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channels (NSCC-1 and NSCC-2) in C6 glioma cells. These channels can be distinguished by their sensitivity to blockers of the receptor-operated Ca2+ channel, 1-[b-(3-[4-methoxyphenyl]propoxy)-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1H-imidazole hydrochloride (SK&F 96365) and (R,S)-(3,4-dihydro-6,7-dimethoxy-isoquinoline-1-yl)-2-phenyl-N,N-di-[2-(2,3,4-trimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]-acetamide (LOE 908). NSCC-1 is sensitive to LOE 908 and resistant to SK&F 96365, whereas NSCC-2 is sensitive to both LOE 908 and SK&F 96365. Moreover, extracellular Ca2+ influx through these channels plays an essential role in endothelin-1-induced mitogenesis in C6 glioma cells. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of extracellular Ca2+ influx on intracellular pathways of endothelin-1-induced mitogenic responses in C6 glioma cells. We focused on extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in this context. An inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase, 2-[2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl]-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (PD 98059), abolished the endothelin-1-induced increase in ERK1/2 activity, but only partially suppressed the mitogenic response. ERK1/2 activation by endothelin-1 was partially suppressed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. On the basis of the sensitivity to LOE 908 and SK&F 96365, Ca2+ influx through NSCC-1 and NSCC-2 plays an essential role in the extracellular Ca2+-dependent component of ERK1/2 activity. In contrast, Ca2+ influx through NSCC-2 is involved in the ERK1/2-independent component of endothelin-1-induced mitogenesis. These results indicate that (1) the endothelin-1-induced mitogenic response involves both ERK1/2-dependent and -independent mechanisms, (2) ERK1/2 activation by endothelin-1 involves an extracellular Ca2+ influx-dependent cascade as well as an extracellular Ca2+ influx-independent cascade, (3) because endothelin-1-induced mitogenesis is completely dependent on extracellular Ca2+ influx, extracellular Ca2+ influx also plays an important role in mitogenic pathways downstream of ERK1/2, (4) extracellular Ca2+ influx through NSCC-1 and NSCC-2 has an important role in the extracellular Ca2+ influx-dependent component of ERK1/2-dependent mitogenesis, (5) extracellular Ca2+ influx through NSCC-2 has an important role in ERK1/2-independent mitogenesis, and (6) Ca2+ influx through each Ca2+ channel may play a distinct role in intracellular mitogenic cascades.",

Tetraarsenic oxide (As4O6 [TAO]) is a trivalent arsenic compound that has potential anticancer and antiangiogenic effects in selected cancer cell lines at a lower concentration than arsenic trioxide (As2O3 [ATO]), which has been more widely tested in vitro and in vivo. The authors tried to determine the cytotoxic concentration of TAO in malignant glioma cell lines and whether TAO would show anti-invasive effects under conditions independent of cell death or apoptosis.;The human phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deficient malignant glioma cell lines U87MG, U251MG, and U373MG together with PTEN-functional LN428 were cultured with a range of micromolar concentrations of TAO. The invasiveness of the glioma cell lines was analyzed. The effect of TAO on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion and membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP expression was measured using gelatin zymography and Western blot, respectively. Akt, or protein kinase B, activity, which is a downstream effector of PTEN, was assessed with a kinase assay using glycogen synthesis kinase-3β (GSK-3β) as a substrate and Western blotting of phosphorylated Akt.;Tetraarsenic oxide inhibited 50% of glioma cell proliferation at 6.3-12.2 μM. Subsequent experiments were performed under the same TAO concentrations and exposure times, avoiding the direct tumoricidal effect of TAO, which was confirmed with apoptosis markers. An invasion assay revealed a dose-dependent decrease in invasiveness under the influence of TAO. Both the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP expression decreased in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines, which was in accordance with the invasion assay results. The TAO decreased kinase activity of Akt on GSK-3β assay and inhibited Akt phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines regardless of their PTEN status.;These results showed that TAO effectively inhibits proliferation of glioblastoma cell lines and also exerts an anti-invasive effect via decreased MMP-2 secretion, decreased MT1-MMP expression, and the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation under conditions devoid of cytotoxicity. Further investigations using an in vivo model are needed to evaluate the potential role of TAO as an anti-invasive agent.",

Pharmacokinetics of each drug were assessed.;A total of 37 recurrent patients, 34 (92%) with glioblastoma and 3 (8%) with grade 3 malignant glioma, were enrolled. Nineteen patients (51%) were taking EIAEDs. The MTD of vatalanib for all patients was 1000 mg twice-a-day. DLTs were hematologic, gastrointestinal, renal, and hepatic. No patients developed intracranial hemorrhage. Concurrent administration of imatinib and hydroxyurea did not affect vatalanib exposure, but EIAEDs decreased vatalanib and imatinib plasma exposures.;Vatalanib doses up to 1000 mg twice-a-day combined with imatinib and hydroxyurea were well tolerated.

The mean age was 27.8 years at symptom onset and 31.8 years at labeling (median, 36 years). Forty-five tumors were supratentorial, 30 were frontal, and two were cerebellar; 16 were recurrent at labeling. The median labeling index (LI) was 1% (range, < 1 to 15.1%). Forty-six tumors has oligodendroglial and astrocytic elements, and one had astrocytic and ependymal elements. The median LI was 4.4% in recurrent tumors and < 1% in primary tumors. A higher BrdU LI correlated with an increased risk of recurrence and a shorter time to recurrence. During a median follow-up of 16 months, four patients died; each had a BrdU LI > or = 4.4%. The median time to recurrence was 4.5 months for tumors with BrdU LI's > 5% but was not reached for tumors with LI's < 5% (p < 0.003). The histologic grade of the oligodendroglial component correlated with the median time to recurrence (8 months for Smith Grade C tumors, not reached for Smith Grade B tumors; p < 0.05); there were too few cases to evaluate the median times to recurrence of Smith Grade A and Grade D tumors. The median time to recurrence was not reached for any astrocytic grade, and there were no significant differences in the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. These findings suggest that the BrdU LI and the grade of the oligodendroglial component of mixed gliomas have prognostic significance.",

Here we show that miR-30e, which was previously identified as an ionizing radiation-inducible miRNA, enhances cellular invasion by promoting secretion of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2. The enhancement of cellular invasion by miR-30e involved up-regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and subsequent activation of its downstream signaling mediators, AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. EGFR up-regulation by miR-30e occurred due to stabilization of the EGFR protein. The E3 ubiquitin ligase casitas B-lineage lymphoma B (CBL-B) was down-regulated by miR-30e, and this led to increased EGFR abundance. A 3' UTR reporter assay confirmed that CBL-B is a direct target of miR-30e. Knocking down CBL-B expression phenocopied the effects of miR-30e, whereas ectopic expression of CBL-B suppressed miR-30e-induced EGFR up-regulation and invasion. Collectively, our results suggest that targeting miR-30e may limit the invasiveness induced during glioma radiotherapy. ",

In order to gain more insight into tumor biology of gliomas, objectives of the study were selected (a) to correlate morphometrically evaluated nuclear parameters [nuclear area (NA), nuclear perimeter (NP), nuclear density (ND), percentage of total nuclear area (%TNA)] and microvessel parameters [microvessel density (MVD), microvessel caliber (VC), microvessel cross sectional area (VCSA), total microvessel boundary density (TVBD), percentage of total VCSA (%TVCSA)] with WHO grading; (b) extend such correlations to the ratio parameters: ratio of MVD to ND (MDV/ND), ratio of TVBD to %TNA (TVBD/%TNA) and ratio of %TVCSA to %TNA (%TVCSA/%TNA); and (c) to correlate microvessel and ratio parameters with NP and ND.;A total of thirty gliomas managed at this institute during 2009-2012 were evaluated for various nuclear and microvessel parameters by image morphometry using a computerized digital photomicrograph system. For assessment of microvessel parameters CD34-immunostained sections were used while nuclear morphometry was performed on routine hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections. Appropriate statistical analysis was performed in correlation studies.;All nuclear morphometric parameters showed strong positive correlation with tumor grades (r>0.7). In contrast, though all microvessel parameters exhibited positive correlation with grades, the parameters TVBD and %TVCSA showed strong positive correlation. The ratio parameters (MVD/ND) and (TVBD/%TNA) showed negative correlation with grades, whereas (%TVCSA/%TNA) did not exhibit meaningful correlation with grades. Further, while all microvessel parameters showed positive correlation with NP and ND; ratio parameters showed negative correlation with them.;This study indicates that the parameters related to tumor growth (NA, NP, ND, %TNA), and angiogenesis showed increasing trend with tumor grades simultaneously; whereas the parameters related to supply of nutrients per nucleus showed decreasing trends with tumor grades, nuclear size and nuclear density. Thus, the former accounts for increased cellularity, mitosis, and vascular proliferation, while the latter culminates in tumor necrosis, all of which are essential components for grading of gliomas. The present study will therefore have a vital role as surrogate markers of grading of tumor.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The expression of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family members contributes to the resistance of human cancers to apoptosis induced by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We report that the infection of malignant glioma cells and several other tumor cell lines with adenoviruses encoding antisense RNA to X-linked IAP (XIAP) depletes endogenous XIAP levels and promotes global caspase activation and apoptosis. In contrast, non-neoplastic SV-FHAS human astrocytes and other non-neoplastic cells express XIAP at very low levels and resist these effects of adenovirus-expressing XIAP antisense RNA (Ad-XIAP-as). Caspase inhibitors such as z-Val-Ala-DL-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) delay caspase processing and XIAP depletion, suggesting that XIAP depletion results both from antisense-mediated interference with protein synthesis and proteolytic cleavage by activated caspases. However, zVAD-fmk neither prevents nor delays cell death, indicating a caspase-independent pathway to cell death triggered by IAP depletion. Similarly, B-cell lymphoma-X(L) (BCL-X(L)) inhibits caspase activity, but fails to rescue from apoptosis. Loss of p65/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) protein and NF-kappaB activity is an early event triggered by Ad-XIAP-as and probably involved in Ad-XIAP-as-induced apoptosis. Finally, Ad-XIAP-as gene therapy induces cell death in intracranial glioma xenografts, prolongs survival in nude mice and may reduce tumorigenicity in synergy with Apo2L/TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in vivo. Altogether, these data define a powerful survival function for XIAP and reinforce its possible role as a therapeutic target in human glioma cells.",

P2Y(AC)-receptor stimulation increased MAP kinase (ERK1/2) activation that returned to the basal level 4 h after stimulation and was correlated with a gradual desensitization of the P2Y(AC)-purinoceptor. The purinoceptor antagonists DIDS and RB2 blocked MAP kinase activation. An IP(3)-independent Ca(2+)-influx was observed after P2Y(AC)-receptor activation. Inhibition of this influx by Ca(2+)-chelation, did not affect MAP kinase activation. Pertussis toxin, toxin B, selective PKC-inhibitors and a specific MEK-inhibitor inhibited the 2MeSADP- and Ap(3)A-induced MAP kinase activation. In addition, transfection with dominant negative RhoA(Asn19) rendered C6 cells insensitive to P2Y(AC)-receptor-mediated MAP kinase activation whereas dominant negative ras was without effect. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated a significant increase in the phosphorylation of raf-1 after P2Y(AC)-receptor activation.

This change is prevented by the presence of serum from different species (chicken, mouse, rat, horse, adult bovine, fetal bovine, and human) in the cell culture medium. In this communication the component in serum responsible for this effect is identified as lysophosphatidic acid for the following reasons: First, lysophosphatidic acid alone at concentrations which are present in serum reverts the morphological response. Second, both lysophosphatidic acid and the component in serum no longer revert the morphological response after treatment with phospholipase B (E.C.3.1.1.5). Third, lysophosphatidic acid and serum produce an analogous intracellular Cai2+ signal in rat glioma C6 cells as measured by fluorescence spectrophotometry with the Ca2+ ion indicator Fura 2. Fourth, both the morphological response and the Cai2+ increase are prevented by pretreatment of the cells with 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Finally, a maximal Cai2+ increase induced by FCS prevents the subsequent Cai2+ signal by lysophosphatidic acid. Interestingly, the morphological response is also reverted by Al3+ together with F- ions and also by lower n-alkanols such as ethanol and n-propanol suggesting that a regulatory GTP-binding protein is involved in the reversion.

        "Doc_abstract":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) is a receptor tyrosine kinase promoting tumor growth in a variety of cancers, including glioblastoma. Binding of FGFs triggers the intracellular Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathway leading to cell proliferation. Down-regulation of FGFR1 and, consequently, inactivation of its signaling pathways represent novel treatment strategies for glioblastoma. In this study, we investigated the internalization and endocytic trafficking of FGFR1 in the human glioma cell line U373. Stimulation with FGF-2 induced cell rounding accompanied by increased BrdU and pERK labeling. The overexpression of FGFR1 (without FGF treatment) resulted in enhanced phosphorylated FGFR1 suggesting receptor autoactivation. Labeled ligand (FGF-2-Cy5.5) was endocytosed in a clathrin- and caveolin-dependent manner. About 25 % of vesicles carrying fluorescently tagged FGFR1 represented early endosomes, 15 % transferrin-positive recycling endosomes and 40 % Lamp1-positive late endosomal/lysosomal vesicles. Stimulation with FGF-2 increased the colocalization rate in each of these vesicle populations. The treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor leupeptin resulted in FGFR1 accumulation in lysosomes, but did not enhance receptor recycling as observed in neurons. Analysis of vesicle distributions revealed an accumulation of recycling endosomes in the perinuclear region. In conclusion, the shuttling of receptor tyrosine kinases can be directly visualized by overexpression of fluorescently tagged receptors which respond to ligand stimulation and follow the recycling and degradation pathways similarly to their endogenous counterparts.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Angiocentric glioma (AG) is a newly-classified, very rare, WHO grade I central nervous system (CNS) lesion, occurring usually in children and young adults. Only 52 patients with AG have been reported so far, making it one of the rarest neuropathological entities. Hereby we present two new cases of AG in young subjects with detailed neuropathological investigations and a neuroradiological picture along with a brief summary of all already published literature reports of this tumor. Histopathological examination of the resected tissue from both cases revealed similar changes characteristic of AG. The tumors were composed of spindle-like, elongated cells, forming characteristic pseudorosettes around vessels and diffusively infiltrating surrounding tissue, trapping neurons between tumor cells. Noticeably, some neoplastic cells encrusting vessels extended far beyond the main tumor mass. Hypothetically, this may be responsible for the recurrence of the tumor even in the case of apparently total excision. In immunohistochemistry, AG cells were glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin positive, also exhibiting a strikingly significant epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) dot-like staining pattern. In one of the cases, electron microscopy revealed ependymal differentiation features such as microvilli and cilia. Taken together, all these data strongly confirm a dual astroglial-ependymal nature of the tumor. Follow up corroborates benign character of this neoplasm. Both AGs reported here were immunonegative for the product of the mutated IDH-1 gene what, according to our best knowledge, has never been reported so far. It may suggest that in their pathogenesis AGs differ from grade II astrocytomas, which in most cases harbor a mutation of IDH-1. Noteworthy, neuroimaging in our cases was relatively characteristic but not conclusive, therefore biopsy (at least) is mandatory. A newly proposed so called \"A-B-C\" classification of long-term epilepsy-associated tumors (LEATs) places AG in a category named ANET. The authors shortly review the A-B-C classification of LEATs.

The major goal of the present study was to construct a plasmid-based bax gene vector (pGL1-Bax) and evaluate its expression in vitro and in vivo using athymic mice with subcutaneously growing C6 glioma. Preliminary experiments of efficacy and safety were also performed using pGL1-Bax alone and in combination with previously constructed pGL1-TNF-alpha, as well as with radiation. pGL1-Bax was expressed by C6 cells and was correlated with apoptosis, indicating that the construct and the bax protein were functional. Although intratumoral injections of pGL1-Bax alone, up to total doses of 450 micro g, did not significantly affect tumor growth, consistently smaller tumors were obtained when pGL1-TNF-alpha plus pGL1-Bax were injected 16-18 hr prior to tumor irradiation. Furthermore, in mice with two tumors, one treated and one untreated, progression of the untreated tumor was delayed in the animals receiving all three modalities. No prohibitive toxicities were noted, based on mouse body weights and in vitro assays of blood and spleen. Significant increases in spleen mass, total leukocyte counts, percentage of granulocytes, spontaneous blastogenesis, and CD71-expressing B cells were primarily associated with tumor presence and not treatment type. Overall, the results are promising and suggest that TNF-alpha/Bax gene therapy may be beneficial against highly malignant tumors of the brain. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bax gene therapy used together with radiation in an in vivo glioma model.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate in a rat glioma cell line (C6) the effect of VB biotechnologically produced by S. vulgaris plant cell cultures in the regulation of the inflammatory response. We used a model of central nervous system inflammation induced by bacterial endotoxin/cytokine (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interferon (IFN)-gamma, 1 microg/ml and 100 U/ml, respectively). Our results show that the treatment with LPS/IFN-gamma for 24 h elicited the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity as determined by NO(x) accumulation in the culture medium. Preincubation with VB (10-100 microg/ml) abrogated the mixed cytokine-mediated induction of iNOS. The effect was concentration-dependent. Our studies also showed an inhibitory effect of VB on neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression. Moreover, Western blot analysis showed that this glycoside prevents specifically the activation of the proinflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in glioma cells without simultaneous inhibition of COX-1 enzyme. Moreover, we found that VB reduced the expression of proinflammatory enzymes in LPS/IFN-gamma through the inhibition of the activation of nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. The mechanisms underlying in vitro the neuroprotective properties of VB involve modulation of transcription factors and consequent altered gene expression, resulting in downregulation of inflammation. These findings provide support that VB may provide a promising approach for the treatment of oxidative-stress-related neurodegenerative diseases.",

The initial course of radiation consisted of 3000 cGy whole brain in ten fractions 5 days a week. After a 2-week rest, treatment was continued to a portal restricted to the computerized tomography scan demonstrated abnormality plus a margin for an additional 2100 cGy (total 5100 cGy/17 fx/36 days). The optic chiasm and hypothalamus were excluded from the high dose region. Following review of all pathologic specimens, three patients with grade II glioma, three lacking histologic confirmation, two unbiopsied and eleven not receiving the prescribed treatment were excluded from the survival analysis. No patients were lost to follow-up. Surviving patients were followed 85 months (median); range 68-125 months. All remaining patients were followed until death. The median actuarial survival for 73 grade III and IV patients was 12.5 months. The 5-year actuarial survival was 10%. The median survival for 54 grade IV patients was 10 months. The 5-year survival was 4%. For 19 grade III patients the median survival was 22.5 months. The 5-year survival was 26%. There was one long-term grade IV survivor (68 mos.) and four long-term grade III survivors (76, 85, 108, 125 mos). No patient developed optic nerve or chiasm injury. One patient, an 85 months survivor, had biopsy documented radionecrosis and hemiparesis. The incidence of necrosis among 62 patients alive 6 months or more (and therefore at risk of brain necrosis) is 1/62 (2%). The incidence among survivors is 1/5. The nominal standard dose for this regimen is 1749 ret. The predictive value of the \"nominal standard dose\" and \"equivalent dose\" formulae for brain necrosis is explored. We conclude (a) that this regimen provides a survival probability equivalent to conventional treatment for grade III and IV supratentorial gliomas, (b) that neither the equivalent nor nominal standard doses predicted the incidence of brain necrosis, (c) that the time dose schedule is well tolerated and has an acceptable risk-benefit ratio, (d) that its advantage to the patient is decreased time requirement and cost.",

Here, we show that two glioblstoma U251 cell clones stably expressing LRRC4 were established. LRRC4 expression significantly inhibited the expression of some cytokines and their receptors determined by microarray and Western blot assays, and dramatically reduced cytokine-induced AP-1, NF-kB, and CyclinD1 activation in glioma cells. Furthermore, LRRC4 expression in glioma cells significantly downregulated spontaneous and cytokine-induced expression of K-RAS and phosphorylation of c-Raf, ERK, AKT, NF-kBp65, p70S6K, and PKC, suggesting that LRRC4 inhibited receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways. Moreover, treatment with bFGF, IGF1, or IGF2 stimulated LRRC4(-/-), but not the LRRC4(+), glioma cell proliferation, indicating that LRRC4 mitigated cytokine-stimulated proliferation in glioma cells. In addition, treatment of LRRC4(-/-) glioma cells with EGF, IGF2, or PDGF promoted long distance mobilization, but induced little migration in LRRC4(+) glioma cells, suggesting that LRRC4 retarded cytokine-promoted glioma cell migration in vitro. Finally, human vessel endothelial cells (ECV304) treated with VEGF grew, aligned and formed hollow tube-like structures in vitro. In contrast, LRRC4(+) ECV304 treated with VEGF failed to form vessel-tube structures. Collectively, LRRC4 expression inhibited the expression of some growth factors, cytokines and their receptors, and the capacity of glioma cells responding to cytokine stimulation, leading to inhibition of glioma cell proliferation. Conceivably, induction of LRRC4 expression may provide new intervention for human glioma in the clinic.",

Our objectives are to identify factors that influence the uptake and retention of BOPP in vitro and to determine BOPP distribution in a human glioma cell line in vitro. This information will aid the development of compounds and treatment strategies that increase the effectiveness of BNCT therapy for GBM.;The amount, distribution pattern, and site of internalization of BOPP were assessed using fluorescence microscopy. Living human glioma (SF-767) cells were imaged after a 24-h exposure to BOPP (20-135.6 microg/ml, normal serum). Dose-dependent uptake of BOPP was determined using both fluorescence microscopy of individual living cells and inductively-coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis of cell pellets. Lysosome- or mitochondria-specific fluorescent probes were used to identify the cellular compartment containing BOPP. Two human fibroblast cell lines, AG-1522 (LDL receptor-positive) and GM019-15C (LDL receptor-deficient), were used to investigate LDL receptor-dependent BOPP uptake. The dependence of BOPP uptake on lipoproteins in the media was determined by exposing each of the three cell types to BOPP in medium containing either normal (NS) or lipoprotein deficient serum (LPDS).;BOPP accumulated in the lysosomes of human glioma cells in vitro, and not in the mitochondria, as reported for C6 rat glioma cells in vitro. BOPP uptake was concentration-dependent and was also dependent on the amount of lipoproteins in the medium. Over the range of incubation concentrations studied and at the single exposure duration time point investigated (24 h), all cells retained a similar amount of BOPP. At the lowest incubation concentration (20 microg/ml, NS), the amount of boron retained was near 10(9) atoms per cell (15 microg B/g cells). Lysosomes containing high concentrations of BOPP were randomly distributed throughout the cytoplasm; however, larger lysosomes containing BOPP were concentrated around the cell nucleus. Little or no BOPP accumulated in the cell nucleus. At incubation concentrations of 20 and 40 microg/ml (24-h time point), BOPP uptake in SF-767 cells was reduced in LPDS compared with NS (66% reduction). A similar result was observed for normal human fibroblasts (AG-1522 cells, 40 microg/ml, 24 h). At 40 microg/ml, in both NS and LPDS at 24 h, BOPP accumulation in LDL receptor-deficient human fibroblasts (GM019-15C cells) was reduced relative to AG-1522 cells. BOPP accumulation in GM019-15C cells (40 microg/ml, 24 h) was not affected by serum lipoprotein levels.;In cell culture, BOPP is taken up by human glioma cells via the LDL pathway and is compartmentalized into cellular lysosomes. Knowledge of this mechanism of BOPP uptake and retention will be important in attempts to modify toxicity and efficacy of this drug.",

Radiology and pathology were reviewed by central independent reviewers. Paraffin shavings for RNA extraction were taken and tested for fusion events involving KIAA1549:BRAF. Tumors were classified as unilateral or bithalamic based on their origin on imaging. Univariate and multivariate analyses on factors influencing survival were performed.;Seventy-two thalamic tumors were identified from 11 institutions. Females represented 53% of the study population, and the mean age at presentation was 8.9 years. Sixty-two tumors were unilateral and 10 bithalamic. Unilateral tumors had a greater propensity to grow inferiorly towards the brainstem. These tumors were predominantly low grade in comparison to bithalamic tumors which were high-grade astrocytomas. The 5-year overall survival was 61 ± 13% for unithalamic tumors compared to 37 ± 32% for bithalamic tumors (p = 0.097). Multivariate analysis indicated tumor grade as the only significant prognostic factor for unithalamic tumors. Six unilateral tumors, all low grade, were BRAF fusion positive.;Unilateral and bilateral thalamic tumors behave differently. Surgical resection is an appropriate treatment option in unilateral tumors, most of which are low grade, but outcome is not related to extent of resection (EOR). Bilateral thalamic tumors have a poorer prognosis, but the occasional patient does remarkably well. The efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has not been clearly demonstrated. Novel therapeutic approaches are required to improve the prognosis for malignant unilateral thalamic tumors and bilateral thalamic tumors.",

In the present study, expression analysis using cDNA arrays revealed several similarities of virus-induced mouse gliomas with human brain tumors. Brain tumors with short latency contained on average 8.0 retroviral insertions and resembled human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) whereas long-latency gliomas were of lower grade, similar to human oligodendroglioma (OD) and had 2.3 insertions per tumor. Several known and novel genes of tumor progression or cell markers were differentially expressed between OD- and GBM-like tumors. Array and quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated elevated expression similar to Pdgfralpha of retrovirally tagged genes Abhd2, Ddr1, Fos, Ng2, Ppfibp1, Rad51b and Sulf2 in both glioma types compared to neonatal and adult normal brain. The retrovirally tagged genes Plekhb1, Prex1, Prkg2, Sox10 and 1200004M23Rik were upregulated in the tumors but had a different expression profile than Pdgfralpha whereas Rap1gap, Gli1, Neurl and Camk2b were downregulated in the tumors. The present study accentuates the proposed role of the retrovirally tagged genes in PDGF-driven gliomagenesis and indicates that insertional mutagenesis can promote glioma progression.",

        "Doc_abstract":"This review examines the apparently paradoxical conversion of transforming growth factor beta's (TGFbeta) regulatory role as a growth inhibitor among normal glial cells to that of a progression factor among glioblastomas (GM). In vitro, TGFbeta functions as an autocrine growth inhibitor of near-diploid gliomas of any grade. In contrast, hyperdiploid glioblastoma multiforme (HD-GM) cultures proliferate in response to TGFbeta, which is mediated by induction of platelet-derived growth factor B chain (PDGF-BB). The dominant hypothesis of TGFbeta's pathogenetic association with malignant transformation has been predicated upon acquisition of resistance to its growth inhibitory effects. However, the lack of obvious correlation with TGFbeta receptor (TbetaR) expression (or loss) between the HD-GM and the TGFbeta-inhibited GM cultures suggests the existence of intrinsically opposed regulatory mechanisms influenced by TGFbeta. The mechanism of conversion might be explained either by the loss of a putative tumor suppressor gene (TSG) which mediates TGFbeta's inhibition of growth or by enhancement of an active oncogenic pathway among the HD-GM. The frequency of mutations within glioma-associated TSG, such as TP53 and RB, suggests that defects in TGFbeta's inhibitory signaling pathway may have analogous effects in the progression to HD-GM, and TGFbeta's conversion to a mitogen. Alternative sites of inactivation which might explain the loss of TGFbeta's inhibitory effect include inactivating mutation/loss of the TbetaR type II, alterations in post-receptor signal transmission or the cyclin/cyclin dependent kinase system which regulates the phosphorylation of pRB. Loss or inactivation of a glial TSG with a consequent failure of inhibition appears to allow TGFbeta's other constitutive effects, such as induction of c-sis, to become functionally dominant. Mechanistically, TGFbeta's conversion from autocrine inhibitor to mitogen promotes 'clonal dominance' by conferring a Darwinian advantage to the hyperdiploid subpopulations through qualitative and quantitative differences in its modulation of PDGF-A and c-sis, with concomitant paracrine inhibition of competing, near-diploid elements.",

For in vivo studies, F98 wild-type receptor-negative or EGFRvIII human gene-transfected receptor-positive F98(npEGFRvIII) glioma cells were implanted i.c. into the brains of Fischer rats. Biodistribution studies were initiated 14 days later. Animals received [(125)I]BD-L8A4 by either convection enhanced delivery (CED) or direct i.t. injection and were euthanized 6, 12, 24, or 48 hours later.;At 6 hours, equivalent amounts of the bioconjugate were detected in receptor-positive and receptor-negative tumors, but by 24 hours the amounts retained by receptor-positive gliomas were 60.1% following CED and 43.7% following i.t. injection compared with 14.6% ID/g by receptor-negative tumors. Boron concentrations in normal brain, blood, liver, kidneys, and spleen all were at nondetectable levels (<0.5 microg/g) at the corresponding times. Based on these favorable biodistribution data, BNCT studies were initiated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Research Reactor-II. Rats received BD-L8A4 ( approximately 40 microg (10)B/ approximately 750 mug protein) by CED either alone or in combination with i.v. boronophenylalanine (BPA; 500 mg/kg). BNCT was carried out 24 hours after administration of the bioconjugate and 2.5 hours after i.v. injection of BPA for those animals that received both agents. Rats that received BD-L8A4 by CED in combination with i.v. BPA had a mean +/- SE survival time of 85.5 +/- 15.5 days with 20% long-term survivors (>6 months) and those that received BD-L8A4 alone had a mean +/- SE survival time of 70.4 +/- 11.1 days with 10% long-term survivors compared with 40.1 +/- 2.2 days for i.v.

Forty glial tumors were divided into three groups according to the clinical stage: Samples from Group A patients were obtained before therapy and/or after biopsy; in these patients a large volume of tumor was apparent on computerized tomography (CT). Group B samples were obtained after gross total removal of the tumor and/or chemo- and radiation therapy; these patients showed a small volume of residual tumor on CT.

Urinary EGF levels in Group A samples were statistically significantly higher than in samples from healthy individuals (p < 0.001), Group B patients (p < 0.10), and Group C patients (p < 0.02). In addition, high-grade glial tumors in Group A cases showed a significantly higher level of urinary EGF than low-grade tumors in Group A patients (p < 0.05), or patients with meningioma (p < 0.02), metastatic brain tumor (p < 0.05), and cerebral infarction (p < 0.001).

In this study, we developed and characterized selumetinib resistance and explored approaches to circumventing the mechanisms of acquired resistance.;BT-40 xenografts were selected in vivo for selumetinib resistance. Resistant tumors were obtained and characterized, as were tumors that reverted to sensitivity. Characterization included expression profiling, assessment of MEK signature and compensatory pathways, MEK inhibition, BRAF expression, and cytokine levels. Combination treatment of BT-40/AZD-resistant tumors with the MEK inhibitor and a STAT3 inhibitor (LLL12) was assessed.;Resistance was unstable, tumors reverting to selumetinib sensitivity when passaged in untreated mice, and MEK was equally inhibited in sensitive and resistant tumors by selumetinib. Drug resistance was associated with an enhanced MEK signature and increased interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 expression. Selumetinib treatment induced phosphorylation of STAT3 (Y705) only in resistant xenografts, and similar results were observed in BRAF(V600E) astrocytic cell lines intrinsically resistant to selumetinib. Treatment of BT-40-resistant tumors with selumetinib or LLL12 had no significant effect, whereas combined treatment induced complete regressions of BT-40/AZD-resistant xenografts.;Resistance to selumetinib selected in vivo in BT-40 tumor xenografts was unstable. In resistant tumors, selumetinib activated STAT3, and combined treatment with selumetinib and LLL12 induced complete responses in resistant BT-40 tumors. These results suggest dual targeting BRAF (V600E) signaling and STAT3 signaling may be effective in selumetinib-resistant tumors or may retard or prevent onset of resistance.",

Our previous studies with electropermeabilized (EP) rat glioma (C6) cells have indicated that the intermediates of this pathway are not freely diffusible in the cell but are channeled toward synthesis of Ptd-choline (George, T.P., Morash, S.C., Cook, H.W., Byers, D.M., Palmer, F. B. St.C., and Spence, M.W. (1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1004, 283-291). In this study, Ca(2+)-[ethylene-bis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid buffers were used to investigate the role of intracellular free Ca2+ levels in functional organization of this pathway in EP glioma cells. In EP cells reduction of free Ca2+ in the medium from 1.8 mM to less than 200 nM resulted in 2-3-fold stimulation of exogenous [3H]choline and [14C]P-choline incorporation into Ptd-choline whereas incorporation of exogenous CDP-[14C]choline was augmented 100-fold; there was no uptake or incorporation of labeled P-choline or CDP-choline in intact cells. In EP cells incubated at 1.8 mM Ca2+ the water-soluble products of choline metabolism (choline, P-choline, CDP-choline, and glycerophosphocholine) were retained at 37 degrees C; in contrast, in the presence of 100 nM Ca2+ there was uniform leakage of these metabolites. Experiments with hemicholinium-3, an inhibitor of choline transport, and EP cells at 100 nM Ca2+ show that linkage of choline transport and Ptd-choline biosynthesis is also dependent on Ca2+. These results suggest that channeling of intermediates in the CDP-choline pathway of Ptd-choline biosynthesis in glioma cells is mediated by intracellular Ca2+ levels that may coordinately regulate the steps involved in conversion of choline to Ptd-choline.",

We retrospectively reviewed 11 cases. These cases included 4 ependymomas, 6 astrocytic tumors, and 1 neurocytoma. Patients' age ranged from 9 to 50 years (mean, 26 y; median, 24 y). All ependymal tumors with detailed clinical history (n=3) were not associated with any other ovarian neoplasm. In contrast, all astrocytic tumors were associated with immature teratoma (n=4), mature cystic teratoma (n=1), or mixed germ cell tumor (n=1). The neurocytoma arose in association with mature teratomatous components in a patient with a history of treated mixed germ cell tumor. Immunohistochemical staining showed that 7 of 7 ependymal and astrocytic tumors (100%) were positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein, and 2 of 2 ependymomas (100%) were positive for both estrogen and progesterone receptors. The neurocytoma was positive for synaptophysin and negative for S100 protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and SALL4. No IDH1-R132H mutation was detected in 2 of 2 (0%) astrocytomas by immunohistochemistry. Next-generation sequencing was performed on additional 2 ependymomas and 2 astrocytomas but detected no mutations in a panel of 50 genes that included IDH1, IDH2, TP53, PIK3CA, EGFR, BRAF, and PTEN. Follow-up information was available for 8 patients, with the follow-up period ranging from 4 to 59 months (mean, 15 mo; median, 8.5 mo), of which 3 had no evidence of disease and 5 were alive with disease. In conclusion, primary glial and neuronal tumors of the ovary can arise independently or in association with other ovarian germ cell tumor components. Pathologists should be aware of these rare tumors and differentiate them from other ovarian neoplasms. Even though an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation is found in the majority of WHO grade II and III astrocytomas, and in secondary glioblastomas arising from them, such mutations were not identified in our series, suggesting that these tumors are molecularly different from their central nervous system counterparts despite their morphologic and immunophenotypic similarities.

The uptake of FET, FCH and FDG was measured using autoradiography and correlated with histology, disruption of the BBB and MVD.;The mean FET, FCH and FDG standardised uptake values (SUVs) in the tumour and the contralateral normal cortex (in parentheses) were 4.19+/-0.86 (1.32+/-0.26), 2.98+/-0.58 (0.51+/-0.11) and 11.02+/-3.84 (4.76+/-1.77) respectively. MVD was significantly correlated only with FCH uptake. There was a trend towards a negative correlation between the degree of BBB disruption and FCH uptake and a trend towards a positive correlation with FET uptake. The ratio of the uptake in tumours to that in the radiation injuries was 1.97 (FCH), 2.71 (FET) and 2.37 (FDG).;MVD displayed a significant effect only on FCH uptake. The degree of BBB disruption seems to affect the accumulation of FET and FCH, but not FDG. Mean tumour uptake for all tracers was significantly higher than the accumulation in radiation injuries.",

However, the roles of heparanase in the regulation of gene expression and the subsequent cell function changes other than invasion are not clear. In the current study, we overexpressed the human heparanase gene in a human U251n glioma cell line. We found that heparanase-overexpression significantly increased cell invasion, proliferation, anchorage-independent colony formation and chemotactic migration towards fetal bovine serum (FBS)-supplied medium and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). These phenotypic appearances were accompanied by enhanced protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation.

A total of 56 samples (8 adjoining regions of 6 glioblastoma tumors) were immunohistochemically examined for the expression and regional distribution of gelatinase-A (MMP-2), gelatinase-B (MMP-9), matrilysin (MMP-7) and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3). Gelatinase-A mRNA was detected in all samples, gelatinase-B was found in numerous samples. Correspondingly, strong expression levels of both gelatinase protein was seen in immunohistochemistry. Gelatinase-A was expressed by both tumor cells and endothelium while gelatinase-B was found to be restricted to endothelial cells. Stromelysin-1 protein was not detected in any of the samples. Matrilysin was found around tumor cells of three samples from one patient only. The strong immunoreactivity seen for gelatinase-A around tumor cells and blood vessels suggests a role in both tissue degradation and tumor neoangiogenesis which is in accordance with previously published in vitro data. The marked localization of gelatinase-B to the endothelium and its presence in non-infiltrative benign lesions, however, makes a direct proteolytic role of gelatinase-B on ECM components during glioma invasion appear unlikely. Its close association with vascular structures, however, might indicate a link to neoangiogenesis. The significance of matrilysin which was only seen in tumor cells in three samples remains unclear. Stromelysin-1, though strongly expressed in cell lines, does not appear to play a role in glioblastoma tumors in vivo.",

In these cells HGF induces expression of c-Met via PKC, Ras and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Here we report that secretion and expression of HGF in U87 astrocytoma is increased by a PKC activator, PMA, an effect which is abolished by a PKC inhibitor, Go6976, specific for PKCalpha and PKCbeta1. Activating PKA by forskolin, on the other hand, had no effect. Furthermore, messenger molecule downstream of PKC, i.e. MEK mediates such effect of PKC as specific MEK inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126) abolished PMA induced HGF secretion by U87 cells. Accordingly, PMA induced rapid phosphorylation of MEK substrate, i.e. Erk1/2 (p42/44 MAPK). In addition, such effect of PKC is Ras-dependent as specific Ras inhibitor L-744,832 attenuated both PMA mediated induction of Erk 1/2 phosphorylation as well as HGF secretion. Moreover, a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) almost completely inhibited basal HGF secretion to an undetectable level. Increased secretion of HGF is most likely exerted at the transcriptional level since inhibitor of transcription, actinomycin D abolished such increase. Furthermore, when assessed by Northern blot analysis, PMA increased HGF transcripts while U0127 and SB203580 inhibited. Therefore, our data reveal that HGF secretion in U87 cells is regulated by Ras-dependent PKC, MEK cascade and in parallel by p38 MAPK pathway. Since the Raf-PKC-MEK cascade is used for HGF's signaling via its receptor in astrocytoma cells, our data revealing similar regulatory mechanism for HGF secretion in these cells would help to explain the feed forward nature of HGF action in glioma cells that would further accentuate its basal secretion, exacerbating its effects on the progression of gliomas in an autocrine fashion.",

Immunotherapy could offer a possibility to eradicate remnant tumor cells after conventional therapy. Experimental immunotherapy can induce partial cure of established intracerebral tumors in several rodent models. One reason for the limited therapeutic effects could be immunosuppression induced by both the growing tumor and the induced immune reaction. NO has been implicated in tumor-derived immune suppression in tumor-bearing hosts, and unspecific inhibitors of NO synthase have been shown to boost antitumor immunity. In this study, we show that the inducible NO synthase (iNOS)-specific inhibitor mercaptoethylguanidine (MEG) superiorly enhanced lymphocyte reactivity after polyclonal stimulation compared with the iNOS-specific inhibitor L-NIL and the unspecific NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME. Both iNOS inhibitors increased the number and proliferation of T cells but not of B cells. When combined during postimmunization with IFN-gamma-secreting N32 rat glioma cells of rats harboring intracerebral tumors, only MEG increased the cure rate. However, this was only achieved when MEG was administered after immunizations. These findings implicate that NO has both enhancing and suppressive effects after active immunotherapy.",

When C6 cells were exposed to arsenite (50-100 microM for 1 h) or heat (42 degrees C for 30 min), expression of hsp27 and alpha B-crystallin was stimulated, with levels of the two proteins reaching a maximum after 10-16 h of culture. Induction of hsp27 was markedly enhanced when cells were exposed to arsenite in the presence of isoproterenol (20 microM) or epinephrine (20 microM) but not in the presence of phenylephrine. The stimulatory effects of isoproterenol and epinephrine were blocked completely by propranolol, an antagonist of beta-adrenergic receptors. Cholera toxin (2 micrograms/ml), forskolin (20 microM), and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (2.5 mM), all of which are known to increase intracellular levels of cyclic AMP, also stimulated the arsenite- or heat-induced accumulation of hsp27. Treatment of cells with each of these modulators alone did not result in the induction of hsp27. The level of hsp70 in C6 cells, as estimated by western blot analysis, was also enhanced by arsenite or heat stress. However, induction of hsp70 by stress was barely stimulated by isoproterenol. By contrast, induction of alpha B-crystallin by heat or arsenite stress was suppressed when isoproterenol, cholera toxin, forskolin, or dibutyryl cyclic AMP was present during the stress period. Northern blot analysis of the expression of mRNAs for hsp70, hsp27, and alpha B-crystallin showed that the modulation of the stress-induced accumulation of the three hsps by the various agents was regulated at the level of the corresponding mRNA. These results indicate that stress responses of hsp70, hsp27, and alpha B-crystallin in C6 rat glioma cells are regulated differently and, moreover, that when the level of cyclic AMP increases in cells, the response to stress of hsp27 is stimulated but that of alpha B-crystallin is suppressed.",

This treatment regimen is often associated with significant lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and progressive blood-brain barrier dysfunction that can result in clinical and radiologic deterioration without true tumor progression (\"pseudoprogression\"). With new evidence that combining this cytotoxic agent with radiation improves survival in this malignancy, many investigators have modified the regimen to further improve patient outcomes. These largely uncontrolled studies highlight controversies regarding the optimal therapy of this disease. This review focuses on the following selected controversies: (a) What is the appropriate temozolomide dose, schedule, and duration in the postradiation period? (b) How should other U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies (such as carmustine wafers and bevacizumab) be incorporated into this treatment regimen?

The role of astrocytes in regulating brain interstitial adenosine levels has not been clearly defined. We have determined the nucleoside transporters present in rat C6 glioma cells. RT-PCR analysis, (3)H-nucleoside uptake experiments, and [(3)H]nitrobenzylthioinosine ([(3)H]NBMPR) binding assays indicated that the primary functional nucleoside transporter in C6 cells was rENT2, an equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) that is relatively insensitive to inhibition by NBMPR. [(3)H]Formycin B, a poorly metabolized nucleoside analogue, was used to investigate nucleoside release processes, and rENT2 transporters mediated [(3)H]formycin B release from these cells. Adenosine release was investigated by first loading cells with [(3)H]adenine to label adenine nucleotide pools. Tritium release was initiated by inhibiting glycolytic and oxidative ATP generation and thus depleting ATP levels. Our results indicate that during ATP-depleting conditions, AMP catabolism progressed via the reactions AMP --> IMP --> inosine --> hypoxanthine, which accounted for >90% of the evoked tritium release. It was surprising that adenosine was not released during ATP-depleting conditions unless AMP deaminase and adenosine deaminase were inhibited. Inosine release was enhanced by inhibition of purine nucleoside phosphorylase; ENT2 transporters mediated the release of adenosine or inosine. However, inhibition of AMP deaminase/adenosine deaminase or purine nucleoside phosphorylase during ATP depletion produced release of adenosine or inosine, respectively, via the rENT2 transporter. This indicates that C6 glioma cells possess primarily rENT2 nucleoside transporters that function in adenosine uptake but that intracellular metabolism prevents the release of adenosine from these cells even during ATP-depleting conditions.",

These groups were treated with the corresponding simulators. The expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-14 and Bcl-2 in each group was determined using a reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Compared with that in the control group, the mRNA and protein expression of MMP-2, MMP-14 and Bcl-2 in the YC-1 and ABT-737 groups was significantly reduced. The expression of HIF-1α, however, was only significantly reduced in the YC-1 group (P<0.05). Compared with those in the YC-1 + ABT-737 group, the expression levels of the four proteins in the YC-1 and ABT-737 groups were not significantly different, with the exception of the expression of HIF-1α in the ABT-737 group, which was significantly enhanced (P<0.05). The mRNA expression levels of HIF-1α, MMP-2 and MMP-14 in the YC-1 group were significantly different from those in the ABT-737 group (P<0.01); however, no significant difference was observed in the expression of Bcl-2. In conclusion, Bcl-2 may be an important factor in the VM formation of human malignant glioma U87 cells under hypoxic conditions.

        "Doc_abstract":"Neural cell fate specification is well understood in the embryonic cerebral cortex, where the proneural genes Neurog2 and Ascl1 are key cell fate determinants. What is less well understood is how cellular diversity is generated in brain tumors. Gliomas and glioneuronal tumors, which are often localized in the cerebrum, are both characterized by a neoplastic glial component, but glioneuronal tumors also have an intermixed neuronal component. A core abnormality in both tumor groups is overactive RAS/ERK signaling, a pro-proliferative signal whose contributions to cell differentiation in oncogenesis are largely unexplored. We found that RAS/ERK activation levels differ in two distinct human tumors associated with constitutively active BRAF. Pilocytic astrocytomas, which contain abnormal glial cells, have higher ERK activation levels than gangliogliomas, which contain abnormal neuronal and glial cells. Using in vivo gain of function and loss of function in the mouse embryonic neocortex, we found that RAS/ERK signals control a proneural genetic switch, inhibiting Neurog2 expression while inducing Ascl1, a competing lineage determinant. Furthermore, we found that RAS/ERK levels control Ascl1's fate specification properties in murine cortical progenitors--at higher RAS/ERK levels, Ascl1(+) progenitors are biased toward proliferative glial programs, initiating astrocytomas, while at moderate RAS/ERK levels, Ascl1 promotes GABAergic neuronal and less glial differentiation, generating glioneuronal tumors. Mechanistically, Ascl1 is phosphorylated by ERK, and ERK phosphoacceptor sites are necessary for Ascl1's GABAergic neuronal and gliogenic potential. RAS/ERK signaling thus acts as a rheostat to influence neural cell fate selection in both normal cortical development and gliomagenesis, controlling Neurog2-Ascl1 expression and Ascl1 function.",

Although the patients generally have longer survival as compared to those with glioblastoma, the timing of inevitable malignant progression ultimately determines the prognosis. Recent advances in molecular genetics have uncovered that histopathologically diagnosed astrocytomas may consist of two genetically different groups of tumours. The majority of diffusely infiltrating astrocytomas regardless of WHO grade have concurrent mutations of IDH1 or IDH2, TP53 and ATRX. Among these astrocytomas, no other genetic markers that may distinguish grade II and grade III tumours have been identified. Those astrocytomas without IDH mutation tend to have a distinct genotype and a poor prognosis comparable to that of glioblastomas. On the other hand, diffuse astrocytomas that arise in children do not harbour IDH/TP53 mutations, but instead display mutations of BRAF or structural alterations involving MYB/MYBL1 or FGFR1. A molecular classification may thus help delineate diffusely infiltrating astrocytomas into distinct pathogenic and prognostic groups, which could aid in determining individualised therapeutic strategies.

Proteolytic remodeling of extracellular matrix is a key event in vessel sprouting during angiogenesis. Urokinase type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and cathepsin B are both known to be overexpressed and implicated in tumor angiogenesis. In the present study, we observed that knockdown of uPAR and cathepsin B using puPAR (pU), pCathepsin B (pC), and a bicistronic construct of uPAR and cathepsin B (pCU) caused significant inhibition of angiogenesis by disrupting the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway-dependent expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Further, transcriptional suppression of uPAR and cathepsin B inhibited tumor-induced migration, proliferation of endothelial cells and decreased tumor-promoted expression of VEGF receptor-2, Rac1, gp91phox, cyclin D1, cyclin dependent kinase 4 and p-Rb in human dermal microvascular endothelial cell. Furthermore, U251 and SNB19 xenograft tissue sections from nude mice treated with pCU showed reduced expression of VEGF and CD31, which is a blood vessel visualization marker. Overall, results revealed that knockdown of uPAR and cathepsin B inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis by disrupting the JAK/STAT pathway-dependent expression of VEGF.

We compared cDNA populations of a glioma cell line (G112) exposed or not to a motility-inducing substrate of cell-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins using two sets of cDNA microarrays of 5,700 and 7,000 gene sequences. The data were analyzed considering the level and consistency of differential expression (outliers) and whether genes involved in pathways of motility, apoptosis, and proliferation were differentially expressed when the motility behavior was engaged. Validation of differential expression of selected genes was performed on additional cell lines and human glioblastoma tissue using quantitative RT-PCR. Some genes involved in cell motility, like tenascin C, neuropilin 2, GAP43, PARG1 (an inhibitor of Rho), PLCy, and CD44, were over expressed; other genes, like adducin 3y and integrins, were down regulated in migrating cells. Many key cell cycle components, like cyclin A and B, and proliferation markers, like PCNA, were strongly down regulated on ECM. Interestingly, genes involved in apoptotic cascades, like Bcl-2 and effector caspases, were differentially expressed, suggesting the global down regulation of proapoptotic components in cells exposed to cell-derived ECM.

Their role has previously been described in colorectal cancer, as well as in gastric, breast, thyroid, prostate, ovarian, pancreatic, glioma, liver, leukemia and many other cancers. In a previous study, we have described protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type T, M, Z1 and Q genes (PTPRT, PTPRM, PTPRZ1 and PTPRQ) hypermethylated in sporadic colorectal cancer. Thus, in this study, we examined the relation of unbalanced chromosomal alterations within regions covering these four protein tyrosine phosphatase genes with this cancer. One hundred and two cancer tissues were molecularly characterized, including analysis of the BRAF and K-ras mutations and methylator phenotype. The analysis of chromosomal aberrations was performed using Comparative Genomic Hybridization. We observed amplification of three regions containing genes coding for PTPs, such as PTPRZ1 (7q31.3, amplified in 23.5% of cases), PTPRQ (12q21.2, amplified in 5.9% of cases), PTPRT (20q12, amplified in 29.4% of cases), along with deletions in the region of PTPRM (18p11.2, deleted in 21.6% of cases). These data may suggest that in sporadic colorectal cancer PTPRZ1, PTPRT, PTPRQ probably act as oncogenes, while PTPRM acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Our study also revealed that gains on chromosome 20q12 and losses on chromosome 18p11.2 are connected with the absence of the BRAF mutation and the conventional adenocarcinoma pathway. ",

Reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis demonstrates increased expression of these genes. In addition, these cells secrete a mitogenic factor that stimulates 3H-thymidine uptake in NIH 3T3 cells. This factor is sensitive to anti-PDGF antibodies and beta-mercaptoethanol, but not to anti-EGF antibodies.

Transgenic rodent models have revealed a role for CREB in higher-order brain functions, such as memory and drug addiction behaviors. CREB overexpression in transgenic animals imparts oncogenic properties on cells in various tissues, and aberrant CREB expression is associated with tumours. It is the central position of CREB, downstream from key developmental and growth signalling pathways, which gives CREB this ability to influence a spectrum of cellular activities, such as cell survival, growth and differentiation, in both normal and cancer cells. We show that CREB is highly expressed and constitutively activated in patient glioma tissue and that this activation closely correlates with tumour grade. The mechanism by which CREB regulates glioblastoma (GBM) tumour cell proliferation involves activities downstream from both the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways that then modulate the expression of three key cell cycle factors, cyclin B, D and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Cyclin D1 is highly CREB-dependent, whereas cyclin B1 and PCNA are co-regulated by both CREB-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The precise regulatory network involved appears to differ depending on the tumour-suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog status of the GBM cells, which in turn allows CREB to regulate the activity of the PI3K itself. Given that CREB sits at the hub of key cancer cell signalling pathways, understanding the role of glioma-specific CREB function may lead to improved novel combinatorial anti-tumour therapies, which can complement existing PI3K-specific drugs undergoing early phase clinical trials.

NFκB regulates various aspects of the cellular response to interferon (IFN).

The role of melatonin as an immunomodulator is, in some cases, contradictory. Although melatonin is reported to influence a variety of inflammatory and immune responses, evidence supporting its effects on important glioma cells-derived mediators is incomplete. We studied, in rat glioma cell line (C6), the role of melatonin (100 microm-1 mm) in the regulation of the expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) caused by incubation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interferon (IFN)-gamma (1 microg/mL and 100 U/mL, respectively) and defined the mode of melatonin's action. Treatment with LPS/IFN-gamma for 24 hr elicited the induction of inducible (iNOS) activity as determined by nitrite and nitrate (NO(x)) accumulation in the culture medium. Preincubation with melatonin abrogated the mixed cytokines-mediated induction of iNOS. The effect of melatonin was concentration-dependent. Moreover, Western blot analysis showed that melatonin inhibited LPS/IFN-gamma-induced expression of COX-2 protein, but not that of constitutive cyclooxygenase. Inhibition of iNOS and COX-2 expression was associated with inhibition of activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). The ability of melatonin to inhibit NF-kappaB activation was further confirmed by studies on the degradation of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB, IkappaB-alpha. Increased production of lipid peroxidation products using thiobarbituric acid assay were found in cellular contents from activated cultures. Lipid peroxidation was decreased by melatonin treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, several genes having roles in heat-shock response were downregulated in melatonin-treated cells, such as 70 proteins, reflecting the reduced oxidative stress in these cells. The mechanisms underlying in vitro the neuroprotective properties of melatonin involve modulation of transcription factors and consequent altered gene expression, resulting in downregulation of inflammation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"This report describes a test of the hypothesis that the oncolytic effect of genetically engineered, replication competent herpes simplex viruses (HSV) depends both on cell destruction by the virus and an immune response to the tumor cells induced in an immunocompetent animal system. The oncolytic vector was a HSV recombinant virus in which both copies of the gamma 1 34.5 gene were replaced with the murine genes encoding the cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) or interleukin-10 (IL-10). The hypothesis predicted that if an immune response plays a role in survival following intratumoral treatment of tumor-bearing animals with HSV, expression of IL-4 should prolong survival whereas expression of IL-10 should reduce it. The results are that (1) these cytokines can be expressed by HSV in productively infected cells both in vitro and in vivo; (2) HSV-expressing IL-4 or IL-10 genes were able to infect and destroy glioma cells in vitro; (3) intracerebral inoculation of HSV expressing either IL-4 or IL-10 into syngeneic murine glioma GL-261 cells implanted in the brains of immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice produced dramatically opposite physiologic responses. The IL-4 HSV significantly prolonged survival of tumor bearers, whereas tumor-bearing mice that received the IL-10 HSV had a median survival that was identical to that of saline treated controls; (4) immunohistochemical analyses of mouse brains at 3 and 7 days after virus inoculation showed marked accumulation of inflammatory cells composed primarily of macrophages/microglia, with various proportions of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, but few B lymphocytes. We conclude that the cytokines expressed from genes encoded in the viral genome influence HSV therapy of tumors and this is probably due to the host immune response. Thus, cytokine expression may be an important adjunct to tumor therapy utilizing genetically engineered HSV.",

Treatment plans for IMRT and RA1 and RA2 were prepared for 10 patients with malignant gliomas involving the parietal lobe. The Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test was used to compare the plan quality, monitor units and dosimetric parameters between IMRT and RA1 and RA2 through dose-volume histograms.

D2% to the optic chiasma in RA2 was small compared with that in RA1. The median dose (D50%) to the right lens and right optic nerve in RA1 and RA2 was less compared with the identical parameters in IMRT, and D50% to the brain stem in RA2 was less compared with that in RA1. The volume receiving at least 45 Gy (V45) or V50 in normal brain tissue (whole brain minus the planning target volume 2; B-P) in RA1 was less compared with that in IMRT.

FACS analysis showed that the cytotoxic T cells (CTL) infiltrating rat T9.F gliomas were CD3epsilon+, alphabetaTCR+, CD8alpha+, but CD8beta-. These lymphocytes also stained positive for the B cell-specific marker, CD45RA, as well as Annexin-V, signifying apoptotic changes. Functional and biochemical analyses were performed to assess whether the aberrant phenotype was linked to other defects. When CD8alpha+ TIL were purified and stimulated in vitro, their proliferative capacity was markedly diminished in comparison with CD3+CD8alpha+CD8beta+ T cells isolated from the spleens of naive, non tumor-bearing rats. Furthermore, the mean fluorescence intensity of surface CD3epsilon was dramatically reduced in the CD3+CD8alpha+CD8beta- TIL population as compared with CD3-CD8alpha+CD8beta+ TIL from the same tumor-bearing animal. Biochemical studies revealed that the expression of TCRzeta and LAT were reduced in lysates generated from CD8alpha-purified TIL with respect to CD8alpha-purified T cells from naive spleen. We believe that these degenerative changes are reflective of chronic T cell receptor ligation, because in vitro culture of rat splenocytes or purified T cells with ConA or anti-CD3 mAb induced the same alterations. In vitro, the downregulation of CD8beta could be inhibited by the caspase inhibitor, z-VAD. These results suggest that the aberrant CTL phenotype found in the TIL of glioma-bearing rats may be novel signals for their impending death and degenerating anti-tumor immune function.",

To target herpes simplex virus 1 to this receptor, we constructed a recombinant virus (R5111) in which the known heparan sulfate binding sites in glycoproteins B and C were deleted and IL-13 was inserted into both glycoproteins C and D. We also transduced a baby hamster kidney cell line lacking the known viral receptors (J1-1) and Vero cells with a plasmid encoding IL13Ralpha2. The J1-1 derivative (J-13R) cell line is susceptible to and replicates the R5111 recombinant virus but not the wild-type parent virus. We report the following. (i) Expression of IL13Ralpha2 was rapidly lost from the surface of transduced cells grown in culture. The loss appeared to be related to ligands present in fetal bovine serum in the medium. None of the malignant glioma cell lines cultivated in vitro and tested to date exhibited the IL13Ralpha2 receptor. (ii) Soluble IL-13 but not IL-4 or IL-2 blocked the replication of R5111 recombinant virus in J-13R cells. (iii) The endocytosis inhibitor PD98059 blocked the replication in J1-1 cells of a mutant lacking glycoprotein D (gD-/-) but not the replication of R5111 in the J-13R cells.

Tumor-derived CRCLs have been reported to activate dendritic cells (DCs) to elicit potent anti-tumor activity. However, the role of DC-derived exosomes (DEXs) secreted from DCs loaded with CRCLs in the treatment of tumors has not been clearly determined. In the present study, DEXs were generated from DCs loaded with CRCLs derived from GL261 glioma cells. These DEXs, designated DEX (CRCL-GL261), were then used to treat DCs to create DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs. The DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs were found to promote cell proliferation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in vitro compared with DEX (GL261)-DCs, which were loaded with DEXs derived from DCs loaded with GL261 tumor cell lysates. DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs significantly prolonged the survival of mice with tumors and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. In addition, DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs induced enhanced T cell infiltration in intracranial glioma tissues compared with other treatments. DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs induced strong production of anti-tumor cytokines, including interleukin-2 and interferon-γ. Moreover, depletion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells significantly impaired the anti-tumor effect of DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs. Finally, DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs were found to negatively regulate Casitas B cell lineage lymphoma (Cbl)-b and c-Cbl signaling, leading to the activation of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling in T cells. In summary, we present evidence that DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs induce more potent and effective anti-tumor T cell immune responses and delineate the underlying mechanism by which DEX (CRCL-GL261)-DCs exerted their anti-tumor activity through modulating Cbl-b and c-Cbl signaling.

After 4 days of treatment, AEA and 2-AG inhibited C6 cell proliferation with similar potencies (IC(50) values of 1.6 and 1.8 microM, respectively), whereas palmitoylethanolamide showed no significant antiproliferative effects at concentrations up to 10 microM. The antiproliferative effects of both AEA and 2-AG were blocked completely by a combination of antagonists at cannabinoid receptors (SR141716A and SR144528 or AM251 and AM630) and vanilloid receptors (capsazepine) as well as by alpha-tocopherol (0.1 and 10 microM), and reduced by calpeptin (10 microM) and fumonisin B(1) (10 microM), but not by L-cycloserine (1 and 100 microM).

It could be hypothesized that this infiltrate reflects recently recruited immune cells that are immediately overwhelmed by a high tumor burden. Alternatively, if there is earlier immune detection and infiltration of the tumor, the question arises as to when antitumor competency is lost. To address these issues, we analyzed a transgenic mouse model of spontaneous astrocytoma (GFAP-V(12)HA-ras mice), which allows the study of immune interactions with developing glioma, even at early asymptomatic stages. T cells, including a significant proportion of Tregs, are already present in the brain before symptoms develop, followed later by macrophages, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells. The effector potential of CD8 T-cells is defective, with the absence of granzyme B expression and low expression of IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin 2. Overall, our results show an early defective endogenous immune response to gliomas, and local accumulation of immunosuppressive cells at the tumor site. Thus, the antiglioma response is not simply overwhelmed at advanced stages of tumor growth, but is counterbalanced by an inhibitory microenvironment from the outset. Nevertheless, we determined that effector molecule expression (granzyme B, IFN-gamma) by brain-infiltrating CD8 T-cells could be enhanced, despite this unfavorable milieu, by strong immune stimuli. This potential to modulate the strong imbalance in local antiglioma immunity is encouraging for the development and optimization of future glioma immunotherapies.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical presentation of OPG patients and their final outcomes in response to treatment.;Thirty-seven patients with an initial diagnosis of OPG were studied as part of a single-center retrospective cohort for their clinical presentation, treatment, and response to treatment over a 10-year period.;The mean age of the patients was 37.1 months, and there was a nearly equal sex distribution. The most prevalent manifestation was visual impairment (94.4%), and other symptoms included nystagmus (50%), growth and developmental delays (27.8%), neurological deficits (19.4%), diencephalic syndrome (13.5%), proptosis (11.1%), and hydrocephalus (29.7%). Tumor staging revealed that 10.8% of the cases were stage A, 54.1% were stage B, and 35.1% were stage C. In 30 evaluable patients, the response to treatment included complete response (CR; 23.3%), partial response (PR; 43.3%), stable disease (23.3%), progressive disease (3.3%), and death due to disease (6.7%). A significant association was detected between tumor staging and the response to treatment, with higher rates of CR and PR in stage B and a higher mortality rate in stage C (p = 0.005).;OPG occur more commonly in the first decade of life, with visual disturbance as the most prevalent symptom. Tumor staging and the treatment strategy are proposed to affect the response to treatment, although the specific tumor behavior in each patient should be considered as well.",

RAD51 is a central protein in homologous recombination repair and during replication, when it protects and restarts stalled replication forks. Aberrant RAD51 expression occurs in glioma, and high expression has been shown to correlate with prolonged survival. Furthermore, genes involved in DNA damage response (DDR) are mutated or deleted in human glioblastomas, corroborating the importance of proper DNA repair to suppress gliomagenesis. We have analyzed DDR and genomic instability in PDGF-B-induced gliomas and investigated the role of RAD51 in glioma development. We show that PDGF-B-induced gliomas display genomic instability and that co-expression of RAD51 can suppress PDGF-B-induced tumorigenesis and prolong survival. Expression of RAD51 inhibited proliferation and genomic instability of tumor cells independent of Arf status. Our results demonstrate that the RAD51 pathway can prevent glioma initiation and maintain genome integrity of induced tumors, suggesting reactivation of the RAD51 pathway as a potential therapeutic avenue.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are an homologous family of proteolytic enzymes capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and thereby facilitating the invasion of tumour cells into normal tissues. The neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAMs) of neuronal and glial cells provide a Ca2+-independent mechanism for cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion. NCAMs are downregulated to promote cell disaggregation during cell migration in the developing nervous system whereas MMPs facilitate migration. Recent studies have shown downregulation of MMP secretion in rat glioma cells transfected with an NCAM cDNA, implying an inverse correlation between NCAM and MMP expression. The purpose of this study was to establish whether such a correlation could be demonstrated in a panel of nine human glioma cell-lines, one metastatic carcinoma and one foetal astrocyte derived cell line. The secretion of two MMPs, 72 kDa gelatinase (MMP-2 or gelatinase-A) and 92 kDa gelatinase (MMP-9 or gelatinase-B), was investigated using SDS-PAGE zymography; NCAM-A was assayed by an immunochemiluminescent assay following SDS-PAGE of whole-cell extracts. An inverse correlation was found between the expression of NCAM-A and that of both MMPs studied although the patterns of expression showed no obvious correlation with histological type or grade of the parent tumours. Our results suggest that downregulation of NCAM-A may contribute to tumour invasiveness by promoting both cell disaggregation and protease secretion.",

SNB19 cells that were transfected with dominant-negative JNK, MEKK, and ERK1 expression vectors showed reduced MMP-9 promoter activity. In addition, conditioned medium collected from SNB19 cells transfected with these expression vectors showed diminished MMP-9 activity in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate, as determined by gelatin zymography. The cotransfection of SNB19 cells with kinase-deficient c-raf also diminished MMP-9 promoter activity. Further, in the presence of a specific inhibitor of MEKK (PD098059), the Matrigel invasion assay showed the invasiveness of dominant-negative SNB19 cells transfected with dominant-negative JNK1 or ERK1 to be remarkably reduced.

In human neuropathology, the immune cell microenvironment of gliomas has been investigated; however, the nature of the inflammatory cells within canine gliomas is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the nature of the immune cells and determine an association between the inflammatory cells and tumour grade. Thirty-four (18 of grade II and 16 of grade III) formalin-fixed and paraffin wax-embedded samples of canine oligodendroglioma were evaluated by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry for expression of CD3, PAX5, Iba-1, HLA-DR, Mac387 and CD31. Variations in immune cell recruitment and activation were evident in all cases. Infiltrating CD3(+) T lymphocytes were common in most cases. PAX5(+) B lymphocytes were less common and restricted to perivascular cuffs within or around the tumour. Iba-1(+) cells were common within the tumour and formed a dense infiltrate around the tumour in a subset of cases. HLA-DR(+) cells were common within the tumour and in a subset of cases formed perivascular cuffs. Iba-1(+) cells typically had prominent ramified processes suggestive of activated microglia, while the HLA-DR(+) cells had a more rounded morphology typical of amoeboid microglia. Rare Mac387(+) macrophages were found in the tumour parenchyma, while increased numbers of Mac387(+) monocytes were noted within the vasculature. No association or significance was established between the immune cell infiltrate and the grade of the tumour (all P ≥0.16). This study establishes that there is a robust population of immune cells within canine oligodendrogliomas and indicates that further study is needed to determine the role of these cells in tumour pathogenesis and progression.

In primary malignant gliomas, the amplification/alteration of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown to play a significant role in enhancing glioma burden. In an effort to dissect the role of EGFR expression in glioma progression in vivo and evaluate targeted therapies for gliomas, we have genetically engineered glioma cells to visualize the dynamics of EGFR and targeted therapies in real time in vivo. Using engineered lentiviral vectors bearing fusions between EGFR and its exon 2 to 7 deleted variant (EGFRvIII) with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Renilla luciferase (Rluc), we show that there is a direct correlation between EGFR expression and glioma cell proliferation in the initial stages of glioma progression. To monitor and evaluate EGFR-targeted therapies, we have engineered (a) short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) and (b) clinically used monoclonal antibody, cetuximab. Using EGFR-GFP-Rluc/firefly luciferase (Fluc)-DsRed2 glioma model, we show that both shRNAs and cetuximab result in a considerable reduction in glioma cell proliferation in culture and glioma burden in vivo that can be monitored in real time at a cellular resolution.

We investigated whether the widely used chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide (TMZ) can sensitize glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) from human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. GSCs were isolated from GBM, and stem cell properties were confirmed by immunocytochemistry and in vivo tumorigenicity. Primary GSCs (PGCs) were produced by serum treatment of GBM-derived cells. Changes in expression levels of various TRAIL-related signaling factors before and after TRAIL or TRAIL + TMZ treatment were measured by Western blotting. Overexpression vectors and siRNAs were used to investigate mechanism of TRAIL sensitivity. GSCs showed greater resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis than PGCs and had lower basal caspase activity. Caspase knockdown in PGCs reduced TRAIL sensitivity. Expression levels of c-Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin 1-converting enzyme-like inhibitory protein long and short isoforms (c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS) were significantly higher in GSCs than PGCs, and siRNA-mediated c-FLIP knockdown in GSCs enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis. TMZ enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in GSCs and downregulated c-FLIP expression. Add of TMZ also upregulated the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase casitas B-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl). Moreover, overexpression of c-Cbl alone reduced c-FLIP expression, and c-Cbl knockdown both enhanced c-FLIP expression and reduced the potentiating effect of TMZ on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The result indicated that TMZ may overcome TRAIL resistance in GSCs by suppressing c-FLIP expression through c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination and degradation.",

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent glioma. Its aggressive and infiltrative growth renders it extremely difficult to treat. Median survival after diagnosis is currently only 12-14 months. The present review describes the use of retroviral tagging to identify candidate cancer-causing genes that cooperate with PDGF in brain tumor formation. Newborn mice injected intracerebrally with a Moloney murine leukemia retrovirus carrying the sis/PDGF-B oncogene and a replication competent helper virus developed brain tumors with many characteristics of human gliomas. Analysis of proviral integrations in the brain tumors identified almost 70 common insertion sites (CISs). These CISs were named brain tumor loci and harbored known but also putative novel cancer-causing genes. Microarray analysis identified differentially expressed genes in the mouse brain tumors compared to normal brain. Known tumor genes and markers of immature cells were upregulated in the tumors. Tumors developed 13-42 weeks after injection and short latency tumors were further distinguished as fast growing and GBM-like. Long latency tumors resembled slow-growing oligodendrogliomas and contained significantly less integrations as compared to short latency tumors. Several candidate genes tagged in this retroviral screen have known functions in neoplastic transformation and oncogenesis. Some candidates with a previously unknown function in tumorigenesis were found and their putative role in brain tumor formation will be discussed in this review. The results show that proviral tagging may be a useful tool in the search for candidate glioma genes.",

The distributed diffusion coefficient values were significantly lower than in normal white matter or normal gray matter. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the presence of tumors in the peritumor region that could be histologically distinguished from the main tumor mass.

Sixteen clones were completely karyotyped with the G-banding technique. The unique markers 1p-q+, 16p- found in all clones, as well as in the parallel uncloned line, U-343 MG, provided evidence of their common origin. The deduced early, possibly partly primary, deviations had the formula 44, XY, 1p-q+, -14, 16p-, -22, where loss of one chromosome 22 is in accordance with previous reports on early chromosomal deviations in gliomas. Two clones, the hypodiploid 26L and 5H, represented early progressional changes. The other clones followed two patterns of late progressional changes, probably starting from the karyotype of 5H, with additional markers and doubling of the stemlines. In late progressional line I 12q+ and in II +7 were the most characteristic findings. Northern blot analysis using complementary DNA clones for the A and B chains of PDGF showed that both PDGF chains were expressed in 26L and 5H indicating that activation of the PDGF genes could have been an early event in the development of this glioma. Clones with late progression pattern II had been subjected to the highest selective pressure in vitro, and they secreted the highest amount of PDGF-like activity to the extracellular medium. Among them were the most rapidly and tightly growing cells and some clones with high 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor binding. Possibly these findings reflect progressional changes including defective regulation of the growth factor/growth factor receptor genes, selected for in vitro, without involving gross rearrangements or amplifications of the genes. The possible significance of extra chromosomes 7, with the PDGF A chain and epidermal growth factor receptor genes, and of the 12q+ marker, located near the gamma interferon gene is discussed.",

The Th cell clone is noncytolytic and proliferates specifically in the presence of irradiated autologous melanoma cells or autologous EBV-transformed B cells pulsed with melanoma tumor cell lysates. Th35-1A produces IFN-gamma (a Th1-type cytokine) after autologous tumor cell stimulation, and its proliferative reactivity is HLA class II-restricted. Th cells showed helper activity for PWM responses of PBMCs. Using a panel of HLA class II-matched and unmatched EBV-B cells as APCs and allogeneic melanoma tumor cell lysate as stimulant, DR7 was delineated as the HLA class II restriction element used by the Th cell clone. In agreement with these results, transfection of an allogeneic melanoma cell line with HLA-DR7 isolated from autologous EBV-B cells rendered the cell line stimulatory for Th35-1A cells. Specificity studies using autologous EBV-B cells (EBV-B35) pulsed with a panel of allogeneic tumor cell lysates of various tissue origins indicated that the Th cell clone recognizes an antigen shared by melanoma and glioma cells. The availability of the Th cell clone may lead to the development of new therapies against melanoma, using adoptive Th cell transfer and/or active immunization with a shared Th cell antigen.",

In a greater number of patients the amount of accumulated stereoisomers do not differ on a significant level, indicating that a raised transport rate mediated by a carrier of low stereospecifity seems to contribute substantially to the increased uptake of [11C-methyl]-L-methionine in human brain tumors. Several cerebral functions and diseases have been studied with positron emission tomography (PET), which represents a clinical tool for visualizing metabolic activities rather than morphologic lesions (Reivich et al. 1985; Mazziotta et al. 1986). With regard to the malignancy of brain tumors DiChiro et al. (1982, 1984, 1985a, b) showed a correlation between tumor grade and its glucose metabolism measured with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose.

        "Doc_abstract":"Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is the most common astrocytic neoplasm of childhood. Patients have an extremely favorable prognosis after surgical resection, qualifying tumors for a grade I designation by the World Health Organization. The molecular data on PA support a key role for the BRAF oncogene in the pathogenesis of these tumors, with the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion being the most common alteration identified in sporadic cases, particularly those occurring in the posterior fossa. Constitutive activation of BRAF leads to downstream activation of the MEK/MAPK/ERK/p16 pathway, which interestingly is also used by cells to activate oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). In fact, the presence of an active OIS pathway might explain the periods of dormancy or spontaneous regression or both, that can be seen in PA. In addition to reviewing the historical evolution, clinicopathologic, predictive, prognostic, and molecular features of PA, we discuss current therapeutic strategies and the caveats that should be considered for the development of therapies that could be used to more effectively treat challenging cases. Individualized treatment requires identification of the type of MAPK alteration, as several alterations in BRAF have been described in addition to the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion. Combination regimens would also appear crucial to achieve tumor eradication and prevent the development of drug resistance. Balancing mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway inhibition with abrogation of an active OIS should be carefully considered as well to preserve any existing protective pathways. Importantly, PAs are largely indolent tumors, and care should be taken to avoid overtreatment, as aggressive therapy could cause more harm than good. ",

Recently, we have found that intermediates of this pathway are not freely diffusible in cultured rat glioma (C6) cells but are channeled towards PtdCho biosynthesis (George et al. (1989). Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1004, 283-291). Channeling of intermediates in other mammalian systems is thought to be mediated through adsorption of enzymes to membranes and cytoskeletal elements to form multienzyme complexes. In this study, agents which perturb the structure and function of cytoskeletal elements were tested for effects on phospholipid metabolism in glioma cells. The filament-disrupting agent cytochalasin B (CB), but not other cytochalasins or the microtubule depolymerizer colchicine inhibited PtdCho and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) biosynthesis as judged by dose-dependent reduction of labeling from [3H]Cho and [14C]ethanolamine (Etn). 32Pi pulse-labeling indicated that CB selectively decreased PtdCho and PtdEtn biosynthesis without affecting synthesis of other phospholipids. Synthesis of water-soluble intermediates of PtdCho metabolism was unaffected but the conversion of phosphoethanolamine to CDP-ethanolamine was reduced by CB. Effects of CB on phospholipid biosynthesis were not due to inhibition of glucose uptake as shown by experiments with 2-deoxyglucose, glucose-starved cells and other cytochalasins. Experiments with Ca(2+)-EGTA buffers and digitonin-permeabilized cells, and the Ca(2+)-channel blocker verapamil suggest that effects of CB on PtdCho and PtdEtn biosynthesis are due to alteration of intracellular Ca2+. Taken together, these results suggest that CB acts at sites distinct from glucose transport and cellular microfilaments to specifically inhibit PtdCho and PtdEtn biosynthesis by mechanisms dependent on intracellular Ca2+.",

In this report we demonstrate that this cation-exchange system can be induced within 24-36 h by either serum removal or by dibutyryl cyclic AMP; however, these modes of induction are not additive and are manifest only after activation by serum. In these glioma cells we found that activation by serum can be mimicked in part by specific serum factors, i.e., epidermal growth factor and bradykinin. We attempted to characterize this activation process further using several cell biologic probes. We had previously shown that that activation process involves a calcium-dependent step with full activation obtained in the presence of the calcium ionophore A23187. The activation by serum was inhibited by preincubation with colchicine but not with dihydrocytochalasin B, suggesting a cytoskeletal involvement in the activation process. Activation by epidermal growth factor and bradykinin was found to be unaffected by colchicine, suggesting that other factors must be present in serum that confer sensitivity to colchicine. Incubation of the cells with phorbol myristoyl acetate results in the activation of amiloride-sensitive transport, suggesting that stimulation of protein kinase C may be integral to the activation process. Unlike the effects of serum, activation by phorbol myristoyl acetate is not inhibited by colchicine, indicating that this drug works in a way that bypasses the cytoskeletal-dependent step. Since diacylglycerol is the presumed endogenous activator of protein kinase C, we studied the effects of dioleylglycerol.

We studied alterations in Notch signaling components in tumor tissue from 18 patients with PA and 4 with other low-grade astrocytomas to identify much needed therapeutic targets. We found that Notch pathway members were overexpressed at the mRNA (NOTCH1, NOTCH2, HEY1, HEY2) and protein (HES1) levels in PAs at various anatomic sites compared with non-neoplastic brain samples. These changes were not associated with specific BRAF alterations.

The micelles were formed by the self-assembly of an amphiphilic diblock copolymer consisting of a hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) block and a hydrophobic polymethacrylate block (PEYM) bearing acid-labile ortho ester side-chains. The diblock copolymer was synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) from a PEG macro-initiator to obtain well-defined polymer chain-length. The PEG-b-PEYM micelles assumed a stable core-shell structure in aqueous buffer at physiological pH with a low critical micelle concentration as determined by proton NMR and pyrene fluorescence spectroscopy. The hydrolysis of the ortho ester side-chain at physiological pH was minimal yet much accelerated at mildly acidic pHs. Doxorubicin (Dox) was successfully loaded into the micelles at pH 7.4 and was released at a much higher rate in response to slight acidification to pH 5. Interestingly, the release of Dox at pH 5 followed apparently a biphasic profile, consisting of an initial fast phase of several hours followed by a sustained release period of several days. Dox loaded in the micelles was rapidly taken up by human glioma (T98G) cells in vitro, accumulating in the endolysosome and subsequently in the nucleus in a few hours, in contrast to the very low uptake of free drug at the same dose. The dose-dependent cytotoxicity of the Dox-loaded micelles was determined by the MTT assay and compared with that of the free Dox. While the empty micelles themselves were not toxic, the IC(50) values of the Dox-loaded micelles were approximately ten-times (by 24h) and three-times (by 48h) lower than the free drug. The much enhanced potency in killing the multi-drug-resistant human glioma cells by Dox loaded in the micelles could be attributed to high intracellular drug concentration and the subsequent pH-triggered drug release. These results establish the PEG-b-PEYM block copolymer with acid-labile ortho ester side-chains as a novel and effective pH-responsive nano-carrier for enhancing the delivery of drugs to cancer cells.",

HCAR is heterogeneously expressed in various tissues and types of human cancer cells, which has implications for the use of adenoviruses as vectors in cancer gene therapy. Using immunoblotting, real-time PCR, FACS-analysis and sensitivity to infection with adenovirus-lacZ, we analyzed the expression level of hCAR in glioma Grade IV cell lines. With real-time PCR, we also analyzed hCAR expression in primary human astrocytomas of different malignancy grades, as well as in their xenograft derivatives. Analysis of a set of 10 cell lines showed great variation in hCAR expression. Susceptibility to Ad5lacZ correlated well with hCAR expression, whereas no correlation was observed with the expression of alphavbeta3/alphavbeta5 integrins, proposed to function as co-receptors for adenoviruses. A great variation of CAR expression was also observed in primary astrocytomas of different malignancy grades. The mean value of CAR expression was significantly lower in 22 Grade IV tumors as compared to the values for 6 Grade II (p = 0.01) and 6 Grade III (p = 0.01) tumors. When the hCAR expression in 11 xenografts derived from Grade IV gliomas were compared to the levels detected in the original parental tumors, a mean 12-fold higher expression was seen in the xenografts (P = 0.01). Two xenografts with low hCAR expression grew considerably faster than the hCAR-expressing cells. Our results have relevance for the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy against astrocytomas.",

While undergoing apoptosis, there was a remarkable accumulation of G2/M cells with the upregulatoin of Wee1 but it also inhibited cyclin B, CDK1 and Cdc25c that led to G2/M arrest. Along with cytotoxicity in C6 cells, several apoptotic events including mitochondrial cytochrome c release, activation of caspase-9, -3 and -8 and DNA fragmentation were induced. Berberine increased the levels of GADD153 and GRP 78 in C6 cells based on the examination of Western blotting and this is a major hallmark of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We also found that berberine promoted the production of reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ in C6 cells. Western blotting assay also showed that berberine inhibited the levels of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 but increased the levels of pro-apoptotic protein Bax before leading to a decrease in the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) followed by cytochrome c release that caused the activations of capase-9 and -3 for apoptotic occurrence. The caspase-8, -9 and -3 were activated by berberine in C6 cells based on the substrate solution (PhiPhiLux-G1D1, CaspaLux 8-L1D2, CaspaLux 9-M1D2 for caspase-3, -8 and -9, respectively) and analyzed by flow cytometer and each inhibitor of caspase-8, -9 and -3 led to increase the percentage of viable C6 cells after exposure to berberine. This finding was also confirmed by Western blot assay which showed that berberine promoted the active form of caspase-8, -9 and -3. These results demonstrate that the cytotoxicity of berberine in C6 rat glioma cells is attributable to apoptosis mainly through induced G2/M-arrested cells, in an ER-dependent manner, via a mitochondria-dependent caspase pathway regulated by Bax and Bcl-2.",

As oncomirs promote growth of cancer cells and support survival during chemotherapy, thus microRNA-silencing therapies could be a valuable approach to be associated with anticancer drugs and chemotherapy treatments. miR-155 microRNA was found overexpressed in different types of cancer, such as leukaemias (PML, B-cell lymphomas), lung cancer and glioblastoma. GABA-A receptor downregulation was found correlated with glioma grading, with decreasing levels associated with higher grade of malignancies. A relationship between knock-down of miR-155 and re-expression of GABRA 1 protein in vivo was recently individuated. This finding has implication on the effectiveness of RNA-silencing approaches against miR-155 with the scope to control proliferation and signalling pathways regulated by GABA-A receptor. Applying microRNAs for treatment of brain tumours poses several problems, and fields to be solved are mainly the passage of the brain-blood barrier and the targeted delivery to specific cell types. Glioblastoma multiforme cells bud off microvesicles that deliver cytoplasmic contents to nearby cells. Thus, the exploitation of these mechanisms to deliver antagomir therapeutics targeting microvescicles in the brain could take the lead in the near future in the treatment for brain cancers in substitution of invasive surgical intervention.",

The objectives of this study were to explore YKL-40 protein expression status and World Health Organization (WHO) pathologic grades of primary human astrocytoma and to investigate the role of YKL-40 in the proliferation of both established and primary astrocytoma cells in vitro.;WHO grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 primary astrocytomas (210 patients) were evaluated for YKL-40 protein expression status in immunohistochemical analyses. In addition, after transfection with a plasmid that contained YKL-40 small-interfering RNA (siRNA), cell proliferation and the cell cycle were measured with a cell-viability assay and flow cytometry. Expression levels of phosphorylated, total mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (AKT) were detected by Western blot analysis.;The percentage of positive cells and the staining intensity differed significantly between different pathologic tumor grades (P < .001). The YKL-40 immunoreactivity score increased markedly with increased pathologic grade (F = 18.89; P < .001). In the in vitro experiment, the cell cycle was arrested in G(1) phase. An inhibitor of the p38 MAPK, SB203580, could partially abrogate the cell proliferation inhibition effect by siRNA treatment. The expression levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and phosphorylated AKT were notably decreased in siRNA-transfected U87 cells. In contrast, the expression levels of phosphorylated p38 and phosphorylated c-jun N-terminal kinase 1 and 2 increased significantly (P < .01).;YKL-40 expression status correlated well with the pathologic grade of primary astrocytomas.

A total of 43 PA, including 35 sporadic grade I PA, 4 neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1)-associated PA, and 4 PA with pilomyxoid features, as well as 5 nonneoplastic brain controls were examined. BRAF fusion status was assessed in most cases. RNA was examined using the Agilent Human miRNA Microarray V3 platform. Expression of miRNA subsets was validated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) with Taqman probes. Validation of predicted protein targets was performed on tissue microarrays with the use of immunohistochemistry. We identified a subset of miRNAs that were differentially expressed in pediatric PAs versus normal brain tissue: 13 miRNAs were underexpressed, and 20 miRNAs were overexpressed in tumors. Differences were validated by qRT-PCR in a subset, with mean fold change in tumor versus brain of -17 (miR-124), -15 (miR-129), and 19.8 (miR-21). Searching for predicted protein targets in Targetscan, we identified a number of known and putative oncogenes that were predicted targets of miRNA sets relatively underexpressed in PA. Predicted targets with increased expression at the mRNA and/or protein level in PA included PBX3, METAP2, and NFIB. A unique miRNA profile exists in PA, compared with brain tissue.

Seizure patterns were classified into four groups: A, no postoperative seizure; B, early postoperative seizure control within 6 months; C, fluctuating seizure control; and D, never seizure-free. Rates and duration of seizure freedom, subsequent seizure relapse, and response to AED were analyzed.;Among patients included, 49 (26.3%) had grade II, 28 (15.1%) had grade III, and 109 (58.6%) had grade IV glioma. Outcome pattern A was observed in 95 (51.1%), B in 22 (11.8%), C in 45 (24.2%), and D in 24 (12.9%). One hundred nineteen patients had at least one seizure and were classified as having TAE. Compared to pattern A, pattern B was predicted by histologic progression; pattern C by tumor grade, preoperative seizure, and histologic progression, and pattern D by preoperative seizure and gross total resection. Among patients with TAE, 57.5% of grade II, 68.2% of grade III, and 26.3% of grade IV experienced a period of 12-month seizure freedom.

The contents of GM3 with different cell densities were consistent, being more than 0.4 micromol/g of the cellular weight, which was high enough to be recognized by the antibody. Trypsin treatment of the cells did not increase antibody reactivity. The extracted GM3 retained its antigenicity, being intensely stained with M2590 on a TLC plate; there was no change in chromatographic mobility either, indicating no modification of its chemical structure. The fluorescent microscope disclosed scattered dot-like staining of GM3, particularly at the periphery of the cells. We were able to expose cryptic GM3 fully within 12 h by dispersion of the cells to a sparse density. Surface labeling of GM3 with the use of limited sodium periodate oxidation of sialylated residue equally labeled GM3 either from the confluent cells or the sparse cells. Disassembly of actin filaments with cytochalasin B (10 microM) partially exposed cryptic GM3 of confluent cells, indicating reversibility of the crypticity. All together, the results indicate that cryptic GM3 actually exists on the cell surface, hidden from the surface not by other molecules but by other mechanisms associated with the cellular architecture.

However, the modest efficacy of these drugs and emerging problems with anti-VEGF treatment resistance welcome the development of alternative antiangiogenic therapies. One potential candidate is histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), a plasma protein with antiangiogenic properties that can inhibit endothelial cell adhesion and migration. We have used the RCAS/TV-A mouse model for gliomas to investigate the effect of HRG on brain tumor development. Tumors were induced with platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B), in the presence or absence of HRG.

Imatinib treatment (orally once daily) was initiated 4 days after s.c. injection of rat C6 glioma cells into athymic nude mice and patupilone administration (i.v. once per week) was started 3 or 4 days after imatinib treatment.;As a single agent, imatinib was inactive in the regimens selected (100 mg/kg: T/C 86% and 116%; 200 mg/kg: T/C 68% and 84%; two independent experiments), but well tolerated (gain in body weight and no mortalities). Patupilone weekly monotherapy demonstrated dose-dependent antitumour effects (1 mg/kg: T/C 67% and 70%; 2 mg/kg: T/C 32% and 63%; 4 mg/kg: T/C 3% and 46%). As expected, dose-dependent body weight losses occurred (final body weight changes at 1 mg/kg were -7% and -3%; at 2 mg/kg were -23% and -13%; and at 4 mg/kg were -33% and -15%). Combining 2 mg/kg patupilone and 200 mg/kg per day imatinib in one experiment produced a non-statistically significant trend for an improved antitumour effect over patupilone alone (combination, T/C 9%), while in the second experiment, enhancement was seen with the combination and reached statistical significance versus patupilone alone (combination, T/C 22%; P=0.008). Reduction of the imatinib dose to 100 mg/kg per day resulted in no enhancement of antitumour activity in combination with 2 mg/kg patupilone. Reduction of the patupilone dose to 1 mg/kg resulted in a reduced antitumour effect, and only a trend for synergy with either imatinib dose (combination, T/C 46% and 40%). Pooling the data from the two experiments confirmed a significant synergy for the combination of 2 mg/kg patupilone and 200 mg/kg per day imatinib (P=0.032), and a trend for synergy at the 1 mg/kg patupilone dose. Reduction in the imatinib dose to 100 mg/kg per day resulted only in additivity with either dose of patupilone.

Hyperplasia of the vascular endothelium is a prominent characteristic of human glioblastoma multiforme and simian sarcoma virus-induced gliomas in primates. RNA transfer blot analysis of biopsies from glioblastoma multiforme showed transcripts for PDGF A and B chains and the PDGF receptor. Tissue sections from this tumor examined by in situ hybridization techniques revealed that the proliferating vascular endothelial cells contained large quantities of mRNA for PDGF B chain/c-sis and its receptor and, to a lesser extent, for PDGF A chain. In contrast, the tumor cells expressed more mRNA for PDGF A chain than for PDGF B chain and PDGF receptor. The latter two were also expressed at higher levels in glioma cells than in glial cells of nontumorous human brain tissue. Thus, an autocrine stimulation by the PDGF B chain/c-sis product via its receptor, evoked by interaction with surrounding glioma cells, could be the mechanism behind the pathological proliferation of endothelial cells characteristically found in this type of malignancy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Glioma is the most common adult primary brain tumor. Its most malignant form, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is almost invariably fatal, due in part to the intrinsic resistance of GBM to radiation- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. We analyzed B-cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) anti-apoptotic proteins in GBM and found myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) to be the highest expressed in the majority of malignant gliomas. Mcl-1 was functionally important, as neutralization of Mcl-1 induced apoptosis and increased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. To determine how Mcl-1 was regulated in glioma, we analyzed the promoter and identified a novel functional single nucleotide polymorphism in an uncharacterized E26 transformation-specific (ETS) binding site. We identified the ETS transcription factor ELK4 as a critical regulator of Mcl-1 in glioma, since ELK4 downregulation was shown to reduce Mcl-1 and increase sensitivity to apoptosis. Importantly the presence of the single nucleotide polymorphism, which ablated ELK4 binding in gliomas, was associated with lower Mcl-1 levels and a greater dependence on Bcl-xL. Furthermore, in vivo, ELK4 downregulation reduced tumor formation in glioblastoma xenograft models. The critical role of ELK4 in Mcl-1 expression and protection from apoptosis in glioma defines ELK4 as a novel potential therapeutic target for GBM.",

Histologic examination of both cases revealed white matter infiltration by a hypocellular lesion composed of uniform, fibrillary astrocytes in a microcystic background. Multilocular tumor cysts were prominent, but Rosenthal fibers and eosinophilic granular bodies were absent. Very rare mitoses were seen in the absence of necrosis or vascular change. There was no convincing cortical infiltration, but the subpial zone was diffusely expanded by a band of astrocytes set in a dense fibrillar feltwork which opened out into numerous cystic spaces. No desmoplastic changes or associated atypical ganglion cells were identified. There was no evidence for a BRAFKIAA1549 fusion or BRAF mutation in one case tested.

In intact cells, this sequence is usually demonstrated using radiolabeled Cho since PCho and CDP-Cho do not enter the cell intact. We have studied the incorporation of radiolabeled Cho, PCho and CDP-Cho into rat glioma (C6) cells following electropermeabilization. C6 cells were permeable as judged by [U-14C]sucrose and Erythrosin B uptake and more rapid incorporation of [1,2,3-3H]glycerol into cell lipids, and viable as assessed by uptake and incorporation of [methyl-3H]Cho, [1-14C]oleate and [1,2,3-3H]glycerol into complex lipids. Despite rapid incorporation of [methyl-3H]Cho into PtdCho in permeabilized cells, there was no incorporation of [methyl-14C]PCho or CDP-[methyl-14C]Cho into PtdCho. PCho (300 microM) and CDP-Cho (300 microM) failed to significantly reduce incorporation of 28 microM [methyl-3H]Cho into PtdCho. Radioactivity in PtdCho of cells prelabeled with [methyl-3H]Cho prior to permeabilization could be chased with 4 mM Cho but not with 4 mM PCho or 4 mM CDP-Cho. The water-soluble products of Cho metabolism--PCho, CDP-Cho and glycerophosphocholine--were retained at 37 degrees C in permeabilized cells compared with controls while there was uniform leakage from permeabilized cells at 4 degrees C. Hemicholinium-3, an inhibitor of high-affinity Cho transport, decreased [methyl-3H]Cho incorporation into PtdCho in permeabilized cells, as in controls, suggesting that even in permeabilized cells, Cho incorporation into PtdCho is linked to the transport system. We propose that individual steps of the cytidine pathway of PtdCho biosynthesis are functionally linked and that reaction intermediates are not freely diffusible within the cell but are channeled to PtdCho biosynthesis.",

This inhibition was observed immediately after addition of MTX when monitored with fura-2, which suggests that PbTx2 directly blocks the action of MTX. This blockade by PbTx2 was not affected by tetrodotoxin, which excludes the involvement of voltage-sensitive sodium channels. The depolarizing effects of these brevetoxins were also not a likely cause of this inhibition, because melittin, a channel-forming peptide, did not significantly block MTX-induced 45Ca2+ influx. Instead, this inhibition was thought to be mediated by blockade of an MTX-binding site by the brevetoxins, based on the fact that these toxins, particularly PbTx2, closely mimic the partial structure of MTX. Synthetic fragments of MTX corresponding to the hydrophilic EF-GH rings (200 microM) and LM-NO rings (500 microM) of MTX significantly reduced MTX-elicited Ca2+ influx.

They generally affect patients with relevant risk factors such as immunocompromisation or long-term use of antibiotics or corticosteroids. Treatment usually combines medical and surgical approaches, often including extended necrosectomies, although the prognosis of generalized fungal infections is very poor. In this paper, we present the case of a 17-year-old girl affected by combined aspergillosis and mucormycosis, following treatment of a recurrent glioma. The patient was hospitalized for a suspected cellulitis of the right hemi-face, involving frontal maxillary area and the upper airways and was immediately put on intravenous antibiotic therapies; after performing nasal septum and maxillary biopsies, concomitant mucormycosis and aspergillosis were diagnosed and antimycotic therapy with liposomal B-amphotericin was administered. After evaluation by the oral surgeon and otolaryngologist, surgical cranio-facial necrosectomy was suggested, but refused by the parents of the patient. The girl died only few days later, due to a respiratory arrest. Awareness of this pathology with prompt diagnosis and early treatment may improve the outcome of these infections and reduce the mortality. ",

We detected known mutations at the expected frequencies in common cancers, as well as novel mutations in adult and pediatric cancers that are likely to predict heightened response or resistance to existing or developmental cancer therapies. OncoMap profiles also support a new molecular stratification of pediatric low-grade gliomas based on BRAF mutations that may have immediate clinical impact.;Our results demonstrate the clinical feasibility of high-throughput mutation profiling to query a large panel of \"actionable\" cancer gene mutations.

This migratory behaviour depends partially on lysosomal cysteine cathepsins. Reportedly, the expression of cathepsins B, L and S gradually increases in the progression from benign astrocytoma to the malignant glioblastoma, although their specific roles in glioma progression have not been revealed. The aim of this study was to clarify their specific contribution to glioblastoma cell invasion. The differences between the matrix invading cells and non-invading core cells from spheroids derived from glioblastoma cell culture and from glioblastoma patients' biopsies, and embedded in type I collagen, have been studied at the mRNA, protein and cathepsin activity levels. Analyses of the two types of cells showed that the three cathepsins were up-regulated post-translationally, their specific activities increasing in the invading cells. The cystatin levels were also differentially altered, resulting in higher ratio of cathepsins B and L to stefin B in the invading cells. However, using specific synthetic inhibitors and silencing strategies revealed that only cathepsin B activity was involved in the invasion of glioblastoma cells, confirming previous notion of cathepsin B as tumour invasiveness biomarker. Our data support the concept of specific roles of cysteine cathepsins in cancer progression. Finally the study points out on the complexity of protease regulation and the need to include functional proteomics in the systems biology approaches to understand the processes associated with glioma invasion and progression.",

Molecular inversion probe (MIP) assay showed that large chromosomal alterations were rare among DIG and DIA.

Furthermore, two cases showed gain at 4q12, and a single case showed BRAF mutation. In agreement with previous analyses, this study demonstrates the absence of consistent recurrent chromosomal alterations in DIA and DIG and overall rarity of the BRAF mutation in these tumors.

        "Doc_abstract":"Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor (RGNT) of the IV ventricle is a rare and recently recognized brain tumor entity. It is histologically composed by two distinct features: a glial component, resembling pilocytic astrocytoma, and a component forming neurocytic rosettes and/or perivascular rosettes. Herein, we describe a 33-year-old man with RGNT arising in the spinal cord. Following an immunohistochemistry validation, we further performed an extensive genomic analysis, using array-CGH (aCGH), whole exome and cancer-related hotspot sequencing, in order to better understand its underlying biology. We observed the loss of 1p and gain of 1q, as well as gain of the whole chromosomes 7, 9 and 16. Local amplifications in 9q34.2 and 19p13.3 (encompassing the gene SBNO2) were identified. Moreover, we observed focal gains/losses in several chromosomes. Additionally, on chromosome 7, we identified the presence of the KIAA1549:BRAF gene fusion, which was further validated by RT-PCR and FISH. Across all mutational analyses, we detected and validated the somatic mutations of the genes MLL2, CNNM3, PCDHGC4 and SCN1A. Our comprehensive molecular profiling of this RGNT suggests that MAPK pathway and methylome changes, driven by KIAA1549:BRAF fusion and MLL2 mutation, respectively, could be associated with the development of this rare tumor entity.

        "Doc_abstract":"In the last years, the transmembrane proteoglycan NG2 has gained interest as a therapeutic target for the treatment of diverse tumor types, including gliomas, because increases of its expression correlate with dismal prognosis. NG2 has been shown to function as a co-receptor for PDGF ligands whose aberrant expression is common in gliomas. We have recently generated a glioma model based on the overexpression of PDGF-B in neural progenitors and here we investigated the possible relevance of NG2 during PDGF-driven gliomagenesis.;The survival curves of NG2-KO mice overexpressing PDGF-B were compared to controls by using a Log-rank test. The characteristics of tumors induced in NG2-KO were compared to those of tumors induced in wild type mice by immunostaining for different cell lineage markers and by transplantation assays in adult mice.;We showed that the lack of NG2 does not appreciably affect any of the characterized steps of PDGF-driven brain tumorigenesis, such as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) induction, the recruitment of bystander OPCs and the progression to full malignancy, which take place as in wild type animals.;Our analysis, using both NG2-KO mice and a miRNA based silencing approach, clearly demonstrates that NG2 is not required for PDGF-B to efficiently induce and maintain gliomas from neural progenitors. On the basis of the data obtained, we therefore suggest that the role of NG2 as a target molecule for glioma treatment should be carefully reconsidered.",

Gliomas are among those human malignancies known to elicit an immune response. By a variety of methods in which viable tumor cells have been used, immunity directly partly against tumor-associated antigens and partly against glia cell-specific antigens could be demonstrated in glioma patients. An isolated tumor antigen would provide a more convenient tool in this respect. We have therefore approached this problem by identifying and isolating tumor-associated components from glioma tissue. Immunological identical antigens could be detected in all human gliomas tested so far by a rabbit antiserum. Electrophoretic analysis revealed at least two tumor-associated polypeptides with an estimated molecular weight of 55,000 and 10,000 dalton. Using these soluble tumor-associated components as antigen source, cross-reacting antibodies could be detected in 79% of the glioma patients' sera.",

The structure of jalapinoside B (1) consists of a hexasaccharide core bonded to an 11-hydroxytetradecanoic (convolvulinic) acid forming a macrolactone acylated by a 2-methylbutanoyl, a 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoyl, and a quamoclinic acid B units. Purginoic acid A (2) contains a hexasaccharide core bonded to a convolvulinic acid acylated by a 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoyl unit. Stansin A (4) is an ester-type heterodimer, and consists of two stansoic acid A (3) units, acylated by 2-methylbutanoic and 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoic acids. The site of lactonization was located at C-3 of Rhamnose, and the position for the ester linkage of the monomeric unit B on the macrolactone unit A was established as C-4 of the terminal rhamnose. Compounds 5 and 6 are glycosidic acids. Murucinic acid II (5) is composed of a pentasaccharide core bonded to an 11-hydroxyhexadecanoic (jalapinolic) acid, acylated by an acetyl unit. Stansinic acid I (6) is a tetrasaccharide core bonded to a jalapinolic acid, acylated by 2-methylbutanoyl and 3-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoyl units.

Treatment of C6 glioma cells with Toxin B and exoenzyme C3 resulted in cell death suggesting the role of geranylgeranylated protein(s) in the survival of glioma cells. Relative apoptotic death observed in cells transfected with dominant negative constructs of RhoA, Rac, and cdc42 imply Rho A as playing the major role in cell survival. Furthermore, the inhibition of Rho A kinase (ROCK), a direct downstream effector of Rho A, by Y-27632 or dominant negative of ROCK, induced apoptosis in glioma cells. These findings indicate that RhoA/ROCK pathway is involved negatively in the regulation of glioma cell death pathway. Moreover, in vivo studies of lovastatin treatment in animals implanted with C6 glioma cell tumors also resulted in smaller tumor size and induced apoptosis in the tumor tissue. The implantation of stably transfected C6 glioma cells with expression vector of C3 exoenzyme, dominant negative of RhoA and ROCK, resulted in significant smaller tumor mass, further establishing the importance of geranylgeranylated proteins, specifically RhoA and its downstream effecter ROCK, in cell survival and tumor genesis.",

Some correlation was found between MMP expression and the degree of malignancy. Western blotting analysis revealed a more uniform pattern of distribution of MMP-2 (gelatinase A) than of MMP-9 (gelatinase B) and MMP-12 (metalloelastase) among tumors. MMP-9 levels were found to be significantly higher in grade III anaplastic astrocytomas and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas than those in grade I schwannomas and meningiomas. Anaplastic astrocytomas and Grade IV glioblastomas expressed significantly higher levels MMP-12 than grade I meningiomas. All sixty tumors showed a similar pattern of activity in zymography, proMMP-9 being the major species detected. Interestingly, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expression levels were especially low in tumors of grade II and grade III but significantly higher in tumors of grade I, particularly in schwannomas.

The aim of this study was to identify the target genes residing in the minimally deleted regions on chromosome 1p36.31-p36.32 that might be involved in OTs. A novel gene KIAA0495/p53-dependent apoptosis modulator (PDAM) was found frequently deregulated, with 37 of 58 (63.8%) OTs examined showing reduced expression compared with normal brain. Chromosome 1p loss and epigenetic modifications were the major mechanisms contributing to PDAM downregulation. The role of PDAM in chemosensitivity was also evaluated. PDAM knockdown had no effect on sensitivity to vincristine, lomustine, temozolomide and paclitaxel, but could induce cisplatin resistance in glioma cells harboring wild-type p53. B-cell CCL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2)-like 1 (BCL2L1) exhibited significant upregulation, while BCL2 showed partial derepression in PDAM-silenced cells after cisplatin treatment, suggesting that alteration of anti-apoptotic genes contributed in part to cisplatin resistance. Knockdown of BCL2L1 abrogated the induced cisplatin-resistant phenotype. Moreover, our data suggested that PDAM might function as a non-protein-coding RNA. Collectively, these findings suggest that PDAM deregulation may play a role in OT development and that PDAM may possess the capacity to modulate apoptosis via regulation of p53-dependent anti-apoptotic genes.",

We investigated the influence of hypoxia, nutrient deprivation and current standard therapies on B10 cytotoxicity. The human glioma cell lines LN-308 and LNT-229 were exposed to B10 alone or together with irradiation, temozolomide, nutrient deprivation or hypoxia. Cell growth and viability were evaluated by crystal violet staining, clonogenicity assays, propidium iodide uptake and LDH release assays. Cell death was examined using an inhibitor of lysosomal acidification (bafilomycin A1), a cathepsin inhibitor (CA074-Me) and a short-hairpin RNA targeting cathepsin B. Hypoxia substantially enhanced B10-induced cell death. This effect was sensitive to bafilomycin A1 and thus dependent on hypoxia-induced lysosomal acidification. Cathepsin B appeared to mediate cell death because either the inhibitor CA074-Me or cathepsin B gene silencing rescued glioma cells from B10 toxicity under hypoxia. B10 is a novel antitumor agent with substantially enhanced cytotoxicity under hypoxia conferred by increased lysosomal cell death pathway activation. Given the importance of hypoxia for therapy resistance, malignant progression, and as a result of antiangiogenic therapies, B10 might be a promising strategy for hypoxic tumors like malignant glioma.

The level of most proteins remains unchanged between the different grade tumors and only few differences are reproducibly observable. Fifteen differentially expressed proteins, as well as seventy conserved spots, were identified by mass spectrometry. Western and immnunohistochemical analysis confirmed the differential expression of the identified proteins. These data provide an initial reference map for brain gliomas. Among the proteins more highly expressed in glioblastoma multiforme, we found peroxiredoxin 1 and 6, the transcription factor BTF3, and alpha-B-crystallin, whereas protein disulfide isomerase A3, the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and the glial fibrillary acidic protein are increased in low-grade astrocytomas. Our findings contribute to deepening our knowledge of the factors that characterize this class of tumors and, at the same time, can be applied toward the development of novel molecular biomakers potentially useful for an accurate classification of the grade of astrocytomas.",

In the current study, we show an inverse correlation between PDPN expression and PTEN levels in primary human GB and glioma cell lines, and we report elevated PDPN protein levels in the subventricular zone of brain tissue sections of PTEN-deficient mice. In human glioma cells lacking functional PTEN, reintroduction of wild-type PTEN, inhibition of the PTEN downstream target protein kinase B/AKT, or interference with transcription factor AP-1 function resulted in efficient downregulation of PDPN expression. In addition, we observed hypoxia-dependent PDPN transcriptional control and demonstrated that PDPN expression is subject to negative transcriptional regulation by promoter methylation in human GB and in glioma cell lines. Treatment of PTEN-negative glioma cells with demethylating agents induced expression of PDPN. Together, our findings show that increased PDPN expression in human GB is caused by loss of PTEN function and activation of the PI3K-AKT-AP-1 signaling pathway, accompanied by epigenetic regulation of PDPN promoter activity. Silencing of PDPN expression leads to reduced proliferation and migration of glioma cells, suggesting a functional role of PDPN in glioma progression and malignancy. Thus, specific targeting of PDPN expression and/or function could be a promising strategy for the treatment of patients with primary GB.",

We report the development of a genetically engineered mouse model of BSG using the RCAS/tv-a system and its implementation in preclinical trials. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor alpha is overexpressed in 67% of pediatric BSGs. Based on this observation, we induced low-grade BSGs by overexpressing PDGF-B in the posterior fossa of neonatal nestin tv-a mice. To generate high-grade BSGs, we overexpressed PDGF-B in combination with Ink4a-ARF loss, given that this locus is commonly lost in high-grade pediatric BSGs. We show that the likely cells of origin for these mouse BSGs exist on the floor of the fourth ventricle and cerebral aqueduct. Irradiation of these high-grade BSGs shows that although single doses of 2, 6, and 10 Gy significantly increased the percent of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive nuclei, only 6 and 10 Gy significantly induce cell cycle arrest. Perifosine, an inhibitor of AKT signaling, significantly induced TUNEL-positive nuclei in this high-grade BSG model, but in combination with 10 Gy, it did not significantly increase the percent of TUNEL-positive nuclei relative to 10 Gy alone at 6, 24, and 72 hours. Survival analysis showed that a single dose of 10 Gy significantly prolonged survival by 27% (P = 0.0002) but perifosine did not (P = 0.92). Perifosine + 10 Gy did not result in a significantly increased survival relative to 10 Gy alone (P = 0.23).

Only the creation of competitive highly qualified, multidisciplinary groups including a reasonable number of hospitals will allow reaching the new challenges in the treatment of cerebral tumors present to be rapidly and successfully undertaken in a medium term. These challenges may be summarized as follows: a) the design of less neurotoxic and more effective protocols for chemosensitive tumors (lymphomas, meduloblastomas, germinomas and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas), b) the development of better response evaluation techniques, and c) the identification of subgroups of more homogeneous tumors within the malignant gliomas defined by molecular alterations which confers them a prognosis similar to the treated studied.",

The pharmacokinetics revealed that BSH could move easily from blood to the peripheral organs; it was retained there and elimination was very slow. BSH after intra-arterial infusion (i.a.) was found to move into the peripheral organs more easily than after intra-venous (i.v.) infusion. In patients with malignant glioma, the average values of boron concentration in tumor and the tumor to blood ratio (T/B ratio) after i.a. infusion were 26.8 +/- 19.5 micrograms/g (range, 6.1-104.7 micrograms/g) and 1.77 +/- 1.30 (range, 0.47-6.65) respectively. On the other hand, after i.v. infusion the values were 20.9 +/- 12.2 micrograms/g (range, 7.0-39.7 micrograms/g) and 1.30 +/- 0.65 (range, 0.61-2.94) respectively. The differences are not statistically significant. Boron uptake in malignant glioma was about three times higher than low grade glioma. We found a good correlation between boron uptake and time interval from BSH infusion, and 15-20 hours after BSH infusion the boron concentration in tumor was above 20 micrograms/g 10B in 69% of the malignant glioma patients; T/B ratio was above one in 75%, and above two in 44% of them. We recommend intra-venous infusion of BSH clinically since it is safer, and results in sufficient boron concentration in tumor, and the planned irradiation might be optimal around 15-20 hours after the BSH infusion for treating malignant glioma.",

No signs of apoptotic cell death were found using in situ end labelling with biotin-labelled nucleotides or with DNA integrity analysis in agarose gel electrophoresis. An immunohistochemical method for analysis of cisplatin-DNA adducts was used to elucidate the distribution of cisplatin in brain tumour, normal brain and kidney. Addition of AmB to cisplatin caused increased adduct formation in kidneys, particularly in tubular cells. It seems plausible that the nephrotoxicity, at least in part, was mediated by increased levels of cisplatin-DNA adducts. Pretreatment with AmB did not have any obvious effect on the formation of adducts in the cerebral cortex. The adduct levels in the tumours from animals pretreated with AmB were not significantly increased compared with those treated with cisplatin only.

It describes the distribution of the carbon-13 isotope (13C) at the different carbon positions of metabolites in cells fed with 13C-enriched substrates. The model allows the determination of fluxes through different metabolic pathways from 13C- and 1H-NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry data. The considered metabolic network includes glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the citric acid cycle and a number of reactions corresponding to protein or fatty acid metabolism. The model was used for calculating metabolic fluxes in a rat tumor cell line, the C6 glioma, incubated with [1-13C]glucose. After evolution to metabolic and isotopic steady states, the intracellular metabolites were extracted with perchloric acid. The specific enrichments of glutamate, aspartate and alanine carbons were determined from 13C-, 1H-NMR spectroscopy, or mass spectrometry data. Taking into account the rate of glucose consumption and of lactate formation, determined from the evolution of glucose and lactate contents in the cell medium, and knowing the activity of the hexose monophosphate shunt, it was possible to estimate the absolute values of all the considered fluxes. From the analysis the following results were obtained. (a) Glucose accounts for about 78% of the pyruvate and 57% of the CoASAc. (b) A metabolic channelling occurs at the citric acid cycle level; it favours the conversion of carbons 2, 3, 4, and 5 of 2-oxoglutarate into carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4 of oxaloacetate, respectively. The percentage of channelled metabolites amounts to 39%. (c) The pyruvate carboxylase activity and the efflux from the citric acid cycle are estimated to be very low, suggesting a lack of glutamine production in C6 cells.

In C6 glioma cells, short term (10 min) treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) results in a dose-dependent translocation of PKC alpha, PKC delta and PKC theta. Long term (24 hr) treatment with appropriate doses of TPA results in the complete down-regulation of PKC delta but not of PKC alpha PKC theta. This property was used to determine which isoform might be involved in the activation of the glial cell Na(+)-H+ exchanger. It was found that (a) TPA has dose-dependent effects on PKC alpha, PKC delta, and PKC theta translocation and on Na(+)-dependent, EIPA-sensitive Na(+)-H+ exchanger stimulation; (b) the antiporter is blocked both by staurosporine and in cells in which PKC alpha, PKC delta, and PKC theta have been completely down-regulated; (c) the inactive form (alpha-TPA) of TPA, which does not include translocation of the three isoforms (alpha, delta, and theta) has no effect on the antiporter; (d) Western blot analysis demonstrated dose-dependent TPA (10, 30, 100, and 1000 nM)-induced translocation of PKC alpha, PKC delta, and PKC theta. TPA (10, 30, 100, and 1000 nM)-induced Na(+)-H+ exchanger activation was also found to be dose dependent. There was no difference in TPA-induced Na(+)-H+ exchanger activation between 30 and 100 nM; it correlated with the extent of TPA-induced PKC delta translocation over the same concentration range, suggesting that isoform responsible for the exchanger activation is PKC delta; (e) When 1 microM TPA is added after prior treatment of the cells with 10 nM TPA, an additive effect on Na(+)-H+ exchanger is seen that is not observed when the initial stimulus in 30 nM TPA, as would be expected if the PKC delta isoform were responsible for exchanger activation; (f) Finally, when PKC delta, but not PKC alpha and PKC theta, is completely down-regulated by 24-hr pretreatment with 10, 30, or 100 nM TPA, the Na(+)-H+ exchanger can no longer be stimulated by 1 microM TPA; when 1 nM TPA pretreatment is used, no down-regulation occurs and the exchanger still responds to 1 microM TPA. We have shown that the Na(+)-H+ exchanger in C6 glioma cells can be stimulated by TPA-induced PKC activation and, for the first time, that PKC delta is involved in the activation of this antiporter. Our results also suggest that different members of the PKC family within a single cell elicit specific physiological responses.",

SPARC suppresses glioma growth but promotes migration and invasion by mediating integrin and growth factor receptor-regulated kinases and their downstream effectors. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10), which is commonly lost in primary GBMs, negatively regulates proliferation and migration by inhibiting some of the same SPARC-mediated signaling pathways. This study determined whether PTEN reconstitution in PTEN-mutant, SPARC-expressing U87MG cells could further suppress proliferation and tumor growth but inhibit migration and invasion in SPARC-expressing cells in vitro and in vivo, and thereby prolong survival in animals with xenograft tumors. In vitro, PTEN reduced proliferation and migration in both SPARC-expressing and control cells, with a greater suppression in SPARC-expressing cells. PTEN reconstitution suppressed AKT activation in SPARC-expressing and control cells but suppressed the SHC-RAF-ERK signaling pathway only in SPARC-expressing cells. Importantly, coexpression of SPARC and PTEN resulted in the smallest, least proliferative tumors with reduced invasive capacity and longer animal survival. Furthermore, direct inhibition of the AKT and SHC-RAF-ERK signaling pathways suppressed the proliferation and migration of SPARC-expressing cells in vitro. These findings demonstrate that PTEN reconstitution or inhibition of signaling pathways that are activated by the loss of PTEN provide potential therapeutic strategies to inhibit SPARC-induced invasion while enhancing the negative effect of SPARC on tumor growth.",

The transcription factor GLI1, a member of the glioma-associated oncogene homologue (GLI) subfamily of Krüppel-like zinc finger proteins is involved in signal transduction within the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is involved in the development of many human malignancies. GLI activation is important for cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis in various cancers. To investigate whether the transcriptional coactivator HBx binds to the zinc finger transcription factor GLI1, recombinant HBx and GLI1 were isolated. Expression and purification of the HBx and GLI1 proteins were successfully performed in Escherichia coli. The binding of HBx to GLI1 was detected by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (BIAcore), fluorescence measurement, and a His-tagged pull-down experiment. After measuring the fluorescence emission spectra of purified HBx and GLI1, it was found that the interaction of these proteins is accompanied by significant conformational changes in one or both. This study provides important clues for the structural identification of signal transduction pathways involving the HBx and GLI1 proteins.",

Currently, drug-induced differentiation is considered as a promising approach to eradicate this tumor-driving cell population. Recently, the effect of cannabinoids (CBs) in promoting glial differentiation and inhibiting gliomagenesis has been evidenced. Herein, we demonstrated that cannabidiol (CBD) by activating transient receptor potential vanilloid-2 (TRPV2) triggers GSCs differentiation activating the autophagic process and inhibits GSCs proliferation and clonogenic capability. Above all, CBD and carmustine (BCNU) in combination overcome the high resistance of GSCs to BCNU treatment, by inducing apoptotic cell death. Acute myeloid leukemia (Aml-1) transcription factors play a pivotal role in GBM proliferation and differentiation and it is known that Aml-1 control the expression of several nociceptive receptors. So, we evaluated the expression levels of Aml-1 spliced variants (Aml-1a, b and c) in GSCs and during their differentiation. We found that Aml-1a is upregulated during GSCs differentiation, and its downregulation restores a stem cell phenotype in differentiated GSCs. Since it was demonstrated that CBD induces also TRPV2 expression and that TRPV2 is involved in GSCs differentiation, we evaluated if Aml-1a interacted directly with TRPV2 promoters. Herein, we found that Aml-1a binds TRPV2 promoters and that Aml-1a expression is upregulated by CBD treatment, in a TRPV2 and PI3K/AKT dependent manner. Altogether, these results support a novel mechanism by which CBD inducing TRPV2-dependent autophagic process stimulates Aml-1a-dependent GSCs differentiation, abrogating the BCNU chemoresistance in GSCs.

These patients on single-drug chemotherapy allowed us to evaluate the effects of each agent on sister chromatid exchange (SCE) induction in vivo. Eight weeks following the final radiation treatment, patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: (a) 200 mg BCNU/m2, i.v., every 8 weeks; of (b) 15 mg AZQ/m2/day, i.v., for 3 consecutive days, every 4 weeks. Blood (5-10 ml) was drawn by venipuncture before treatment, within 10 h after treatment, and for two BCNU-treated patients at various other times. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured by standard techniques for analysis of SCE. Eight weeks after irradiation but before chemotherapy, the mean SCE frequency in the patients' peripheral blood lymphocytes was 9.6 SCEs/metaphase. Following treatment with AZQ or BCNU, the baseline SCE frequency was increased more than 2-fold or 3-fold, respectively. Two months after BCNU treatment, there was less than a 25% reduction in SCE levels compared to samples taken and cultured within 10 h after treatment.

Subcutaneous implantation of 9L-IL-4 influenced the systemic humoral response, which was demonstrated by Th2-type isotype-switching and the induction of cellular immune responses, which played a critical role in the rejection of tumors. Serological analyses of recombinant cDNA expression libraries (SEREX), has recently emerged as a powerful method for serological identification of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and/or tumor rejection antigens (TRAs). Because IL-4 is known to activate B cells and to promote humoral responses, and inasmuch as induction of humoral responses by central nervous system tumors has been reported to be minimal, we investigated whether the induction of a potent humoral immune response against 9L TAAs or TRAs in rats immunized s.c. with 9L-IL4 could be demonstrated. Screening of 5 x 10(5) independent clones of 9L-expression cDNA library for the presence of reactive antibodies in the serum from a 91-IL-4 immunized rat led to the identification of three different TAAs. One 9L TAA (clone 29) was demonstrated to be calcyclin, a member of the S-100 family of calcium-binding proteins. The second 9L TAA (clone 37) was demonstrated to be the rat homologue of the J6B7 mouse immunomodulatory molecule. The third TAA (clones 158 and 171) was determined to be the rat homologue of the mouse Id-associated protein 1 (MIDA1), a DNA-binding, protein-associated protein. Northern blotting demonstrated that message for calcyclin was overexpressed in 9L cells. Message encoding MIDA1 was highly expressed in parental 9L cells and thymus and, to a lesser degree, in testis, suggesting that MIDA1 was comparable with the cancer/testis category of TAAs. Sera obtained from animals bearing 9L-IL-4 were found to have a higher a frequency and titer of antibodies to these antigens when compared with sera obtained from rats bearing sham-transduced 9L (9L-neo) cells. To determine whether immunization with these TAAs induced antitumor immunity, animals were immunized by intradermal injection with expression plasmids encoding calcyclin or MIDA1. Subsequent challenge of rats with parental 9L resulted in significant suppression of tumor growth in animals immunized with MIDA1, but not with calcyclin. These results indicate that MIDA1 is an effective 9L TRA and will be useful for the investigation of specific antitumor immunity in this glioma model. Furthermore, these results suggest that this approach, termed \"cytokine-assisted SEREX (CAS),\" may serve as an effective strategy for identification of TRAs for in animal-glioma models of cytokine gene therapy, and potentially in humans undergoing cytokine gene therapy protocols as well.",

As determined by a radioligand binding assay, there were 1.2 x 10(5) EGFRvIII sites per cell compared with an undetectable number on F98WT cells. The tumorigenicity of the F98(npEGFRvIII) glioma was studied following i.c. implantation of 10(3), 10(4), or 10(5) cells into CD-Fischer rats. Mean survival times were 23, 17, and 13 days, respectively, which were equivalent to those obtained with F98EGFR and F98WT cells. As determined by magnetic resonance imaging, the mean doubling times for the F98WT and F98(npEGFRvIII) gliomas were similar (59.8 +/- 4.8 versus 52 +/- 3.3 hours). Following i.v. administration to glioma-bearing rats, mAb L8A4 specifically targeted the F98(npEGFRvIII) glioma, and at 24 hours, 7.7% of the injected dose per gram (ID/g) localized in the tumor.

It has been shown to be constitutively active in some cancers and is being pursued as potential anticancer target. Sulfasalazine which is used clinically to treat Crohn's disease has emerged as a potential inhibitor of NF-kappaB and has shown promising results in two pre-clinical studies to target primary brain tumors, gliomas. Once digested, sulfasalazine is cleaved into sulfapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA; mesalamine) by colonic bacteria, and the latter, too, is reported to suppress NF-kappaB activity. We now show that glioma cells obtained from patient biopsies or glioma cell lines do not show significant constitutive NF-kappaB activation, unless exposed to inflammatory cytokines. This does not change when gliomas are implanted into the cerebrum of severe combined immun-deficient mice. Nevertheless, sulfasalazine but not its cleaved form 5-ASA caused a dose-dependent inhibition of glioma growth. This effect was entirely attributable to the inhibition of cystine uptake via the system x(c)(-) cystine-glutamate transporter. It could be mimicked by S-4-carboxy-phenylglycine (S-4-CPG) a more specific system x(c)(-) inhibitor, and lentiviral expression of a constitutively active form of IkappaB kinase b was unable to overcome the growth retarding effects of sulfasalazine or S-4-CPG. Both drugs inhibited cystine uptake causing a chronic depletion of intracellular GSH and consequently compromised cellular redox defense which stymied tumor growth. This data suggests that system x(c)(-) is a promising therapeutic target in gliomas and possibly other cancers and that it can be pharmacologically inhibited by Sulfasalazine, an FDA-approved drug.",

As a preface to continued clinical investigation of this vaccination strategy, we have studied the contribution of an optimized IGF-1R AS-ODN, designated \"NOBEL\", to the induction of immunity to mouse GL261 glioma cells. The impact of NOBEL on mechanisms contributing to the development of GL261 immunity was first examined in the periphery. GL261 cells are naturally immunogenic when implanted into the flanks of congenic C57BL/6 mice, immunizing rather than forming tumors in around 50 % of these animals but causing tumors in the majority of mice lacking T and B lymphocytes. Overnight treatment with NOBEL in vitro reduces IGF-1R expression by GL261 cells but has minimal effect on cell viability and does not reduce the capacity of the cells to form tumors upon implantation. In contrast, tumors are extremely rare when GL261 cells are mixed with NOBEL at inoculation into the flanks of C57BL/6, and the recipient mice become immune to subcutaneous and intracranial challenge with untreated GL261. Adaptive immune mechanisms contribute to this effect, as immunocompromised mice fail to either fully control tumor formation or develop immunity following flank administration of the GL261/NOBEL mix. NOBEL's structure has known immunostimulatory motifs that likely contribute to the immunogenicity of the mix, but its specificity for IGF-1R mRNA is also important as a similarly structured sense molecule is not effective.",

Matrix metalloproteases (MMP)-9 and cathepsin B have been shown to participate in the processes of tumor growth, vascularization and invasion of gliomas. In the present study, we used a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven DNA template approach to induce hairpin RNA (hpRNA)-triggered RNA interference (RNAi) to block MMP-9 and cathepsin B gene expression with a single construct. Transfection of a plasmid vector-expressing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for MMP-9 and cathepsin B significantly inhibited MMP-9 and cathepsin B expression and reduced the invasive behavior of SNB19, glioblastoma cell line in Matrigel and spheroid invasion models. Downregulation of MMP-9 and cathepsin B using RNAi in SNB19 cells reduced cell-cell interaction of human microvascular endothelial cells, resulting in the disruption of capillary network formation in both in vitro and in vivo models. Direct intratumoral injections of plasmid DNA expressing hpRNA for MMP-9 and cathepsin B significantly inhibited established glioma tumor growth and invasion in intracranial tumors in vivo. Further intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of plasmid DNA expressing hpRNA for MMP-9 and cathepsin B completely regressed pre-established tumors for a long time (4 months) without any indication of these tumor cells. For the first time, these observations demonstrate that the simultaneous RNAi-mediated targeting of MMP-9 and cathepsin B has potential application for the treatment of human gliomas.",

We showed that HCMV glycoprotein B (gB) mediates viral cellular entry via the receptor tyrosine kinase PDGFR-alpha (PDGFRα), resulting in activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, a critical signaling axis gliomagenesis. Here, we investigated the effects of gB overexpression on glioma progression. We demonstrate that gB is endogenously expressed in primary GBM samples and show that ectopic gB expression in glioma cells induced sustained phosphorylation of PDGFRα, Akt, and Src. Recombinant gB protein and the whole virus enhanced invasion of primary glioblastoma cells into Matrigel and rat brain slices, and this effect was specifically inhibited by neutralizing antibodies to either gB or PDGFRα. Importantly, neutralizing antibodies to gB significantly inhibited the invasiveness of patient-derived HCMV-positive glioblastoma cells, suggesting that functional inhibition of this viral protein could hinder glioblastoma progression. gB overexpression promoted in vivo glioma growth and enhanced phosphor-Akt levels and tumor cell dispersal relative to controls. Taken together, our results demonstrate that HCMV gB promotes key hallmarks of glioblastoma and suggest that targeting gB may have therapeutic benefits for patients with HCMV-positive gliomas.",

The pharmacokinetics and brain concentration of mebendazole polymorphs and two main metabolites were analyzed by LC/MS. We found that polymorph B and C both increased survival in a GL261 glioma model, as B exhibited greater toxicity. Polymorph A showed no benefit. Polymorph B and C both reached concentrations in the brain that exceeded the IC₅₀ in GL261 cells 29-fold. In addition, polymorph C demonstrated an AUC₀₋₂₄h brain-to-plasma (B/P) ratio of 0.82, whereas B showed higher plasma AUC and lower B/P ratio. In contrast, polymorph A presented markedly lower levels in the plasma and brain. Furthermore, the combination with elacridar was able to significantly improve the efficacy of polymorph C in GL261 glioma and D425 medulloblastoma models in mice.;Among mebendazole polymorphs, C reaches therapeutically effective concentrations in the brain tissue and tumor with fewer side effects, and is the better choice for brain cancer therapy.

This report focuses on a panel of five genetically engineered viral mutants of the gamma(1)34.5 gene, which was shown previously to cause reduction in viral replication and associated neurovirulence of HSV. These include R3616, which has both copies of gamma(1)34.5 deleted, R4009, which has a stop codon inserted after codon 28 in both copies of the gamma(1)34.5 gene, R849, which contains a lacZ gene inserted in place of the gamma(1)34.5, R908, which lacks 41 codons in frame after codon 72 of the gamma(1)34.5, and R939, which carries a stop codon precluding the translation of the COOH-terminal domain of the gamma(1)34.5 gene. We report the following: (a) all five mutant HSVs were avirulent in experimental animals but were cytotoxic for human tumor cells in vitro and in vivo; (b) the gamma(1)34.5- HSV replicated in human glioma cells almost as efficiently as wild-type HSV-1(F) based on replication assays, in situ hybridization for viral DNA, and expression of infected cell protein 27; (c) capacity of mutant HSVs to kill human cells derived from glioblastoma multiforme (CH-235MG, D-37MG, D-54MG, D-65MG, U-251MG, U-373MG, and SK-MG-1), anaplastic astrocytoma (Hs-683), anaplastic glioma (U-87MG and U-138MG), gliosarcoma (D-32GS), or normal human astrocytes demonstrated that glioma cells varied in their susceptibility to HSV-mediated cytotoxicity and that cultured astrocytes were two to three orders of magnitude less susceptible to killing than were malignant glia; and (d) scid mice, which received 0.5 or 5 x 10(6) plaque-forming units of R4009, either were coinoculated at the time of intracranial transplantation with 106 U251MG or D-54MG human glioma cells or received the cells intratumorally 5 days after tumor induction and experienced significant increases in median survivals, with no histopathological indication of an infectious encephalitic process.

They were compared (a) with each other, (b) with several clinical predictors, and (c) with histopathologic grade under actual clinical biopsy conditions in a study of 1993 World Health Organization (WHO) grade II to IV adult supratentorial gliomas. There was a strong positive relationship between MIB-1 and BUDR by Spearman Rank correlation. In univariate analysis, MIB-1 (logrank p = 0.06) was more predictive of survival than BUDR or PCNA. Longer survivors were distinguished from others by the lowest MIB-1 labeling indices (LI < or = 2.5%) better than by the lowest histopathologic grade. However, histopathologic grades were highly predictive among the entire group (logrank p < 0.0001). Young age (p < 0.0001) and high Karnofsky performance status (p < 0.0001) were the clinical factors most predictive of longer survival. Female gender correlated with longer survival (logrank p = 0.02). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, age, Karnofsky performance status, and histopathologic grading remained statistically significant after full reduction of the model. We conclude that Ki-67 measured by MIB-1 monoclonal antibody was superior to other markers of proliferation. When all factors are considered simultaneously over all 3 grades of malignancy, greatest predictive power resides in histopathologic grade and clinical variables. MIB-1 is expected to be most important in cases where clinical or histopathologic factors are ambiguous or where they cannot be fully assessed.",

Here we show that the IDH variants in CS are also associated with a hypermethylation phenotype and display increased production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, supporting the role of mutant IDH-produced 2-hydroxyglutarate as an inhibitor of TET-mediated DNA demethylation. Meta-analysis of the acute myeloid leukaemia, low-grade glioma, cholangiocarcinoma and CS methylation data identifies cancer-specific effectors within the retinoic acid receptor activation pathway among the hypermethylated targets. By analysing sequence motifs surrounding hypermethylated sites across the four cancer types, and using chromatin immunoprecipitation and western blotting, we identify the transcription factor EBF1 (early B-cell factor 1) as an interaction partner for TET2, suggesting a sequence-specific mechanism for regulating DNA methylation.

All IFN-gamma-treated rats survived to 92 days after C6 implantation (an arbitrary end point) compared with 14 days for controls. Analysis of these treated brains showed that the established C6 tumors had been completely eradicated by this time-point with brain morphology appearing normal. The IFN-gamma-mediated tumoricidal activity resulted from an apparent interplay of B and T cell components of the immune system, as well as the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. This therapeutic strategy may provide an effective method of eradicating established intracranial tumors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Gliosarcomas are rare and poorly characterized malignant brain tumors that exhibit a biphasic tissue pattern with areas of gliomatous and sarcomatous differentiation. These tumors are histological variants of glioblastoma, displaying a similar genetic profile and dismal prognosis. Up-regulation of PDGFR subfamily of tyrosine kinase members, PDGFR-alpha and c-Kit, and their intracellular effectors RAS/RAF/MAPK has a crucial role in the cancer development. In addition, signal transduction mediated by activating mutations of c-Kit and PDGFR can be effectively blocked by specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as Imatinib mesylate. The aim of this study was to characterize the molecular alterations of PDGFR signaling in gliosarcomas. Six cases were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of PDGFR-alpha, c-Kit and their ligands PDGF-A and SCF, respectively. The cases were further evaluated for the presence of activating mutations of PDGFR-alpha (exons 12 and 18) and c-kit (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17), as well as B-RAF (exons 11 and 15). Expression of PDGF-A was found in all cases and co-expression of PDGFR-alpha was observed in three cases. Four cases showed expression of SCF, and c-Kit was observed only in one case that also expressed SCF. Generally, immunoreaction predominates in the glial component. The mutational analysis of PDGFR-alpha showed the presence of an IVS17-50insT intronic insertion in two cases, one of them also with a 2472C > T silent mutation; this silent mutation was also found in another case. Glioma cell line analysis of IVS17-50insT insertion showed no influence on PDGFR-alpha gene splicing. No mutations were detected in c-kit and B-RAF oncogenes. Our results indicate that activating mutations of PDGFR-alpha, c-kit and B-RAF are absent in gliosarcomas. Nevertheless, the presence of a PDGFR-a/PDGFA and c-Kit/SCF autocrine/paracrine stimulation loop in a proportion of cases, supports the potential role of specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of gliosarcomas.",

Therefore, several selective muscarinic antagonists were used to characterize the subtype of muscarinic receptor coupled to the inhibition of hormone-stimulated cAMP accumulation using NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells. These cells were prelabeled with [2-3H]-adenine, washed, and resuspended in a culture medium containing the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.5 mM). The labeled cells were preincubated with the different antagonists 12-15 min. before they were challenged with agonists. The formation of [3H]-cAMP was activated by PGE1 (1 microM) or forskolin (1 microM). In all cases, [3H]-cAMP formed was separated and measured. Carbachol (100 microM) and McN-A343 (10 mM) were used as standard muscarinic agonists. These studies gave the following results: a) McN-A343 (10 mM), an M1 receptor agonist, was only a partial agonist causing 40% inhibition of cAMP accumulation indicating that this effect was not mediated by an M1 receptor; b) The M1-selective antagonist, pirenzepine, exhibited low affinity (pA2 6.2) further suggesting that an M1 receptor was not coupled to the attenuation of cAMP accumulation; c) Two selective M2 antagonists (AF-DX 116 and methoctramine) and M3 antagonist (HHSiD) were used to further characterize these muscarinic receptors. The order of all antagonists based on their affinities (pA2 values) could be arranged in the following order: atropine (9.0) > methoctramine (7.6) > HHSiD (6.9) > AF-DX 116 (6.6) > pirenzepine (6.2).

        "Doc_abstract":"Mithramycin A (MitA) is a chemotherapeutic compound which has been used in the therapy of several types of cancer. For experimental cancer it has been shown that MitA mediates the expression of genes involved in tumor progression such as genes involved in immunosurveillance, cell motility or cell death. MitA works synergistically with Apo2L/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and with antiangiogenic agents. We were therefore interested in analyzing whether MitA might be a suitable agent for glioma therapy. We demonstrate herein that the cell death sensitizing effects of MitA are cell line specific, independent of the endogenous status of the tumor suppressor p53 as well as of the endogenous expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) or basal sensitivity towards death ligand-induced cell death. In glioma cells, MitA reduced the secretion and activity of the migration-involved matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), diminished vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and increased recepteur d'origine nantais (RON) kinase messenger RNA (mRNA), paralleled by a significant reduction of glioma cell migration. In contrast to other cancer types, in glioma cells MitA did not alter the expression of the immunorelevant genes major histocompatibility complex I class related (MIC)-A, MIC-B or UL16 binding proteins (ULBP). We conclude that, whereas MitA-mediated reduction of XIAP expression and sensitization to Apo2L/TRAIL are cell line specific, its antimigratory effects are more general and might be the result of altered expression of MMP, VEGF, and/or RON kinase. Therefore, MitA might be a potential agent to reduce glioma cell migration.",

Our laboratory has previously reported the development of genetically engineered DIPG mouse models using the RCAS/tv-a system, including a model driven by PDGF-B, H3.3K27M, and p53 loss. These models can serve as a platform in which to test novel therapeutics prior to the initiation of human clinical trials. In this study, an in vitro high-throughput drug screen as part of the DIPG preclinical consortium using cell-lines derived from our DIPG models identified BMS-754807 as a drug of interest in DIPG. BMS-754807 is a potent and reversible small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor with many targets including IGF-1R, IR, MET, TRKA, TRKB, AURKA, AURKB. In vitro evaluation showed significant cytotoxic effects with an IC50 of 0.13 μM, significant inhibition of proliferation at a concentration of 1.5 μM, as well as inhibition of AKT activation. Interestingly, IGF-1R signaling was absent in serum-free cultures from the PDGF-B; H3.3K27M; p53 deficient model suggesting that the antitumor activity of BMS-754807 in this model is independent of IGF-1R. In vivo, systemic administration of BMS-754807 to DIPG-bearing mice did not prolong survival. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that tumor tissue drug concentrations of BMS-754807 were well below the identified IC50, suggesting that inadequate drug delivery may limit in vivo efficacy. In summary, an unbiased in vitro drug screen identified BMS-754807 as a potential therapeutic agent in DIPG, but BMS-754807 treatment in vivo by systemic delivery did not significantly prolong survival of DIPG-bearing mice.

Serine, metallo, and cysteine proteinases are 3 types of a family of enzymes that proteolytically degrade various components of extracellular matrix. These proteases release various growth factors and also increase adhesive molecules and signaling pathway molecules upon their activation, which plays a significant role in angiogenesis. Downregulation of these molecules by antisense/siRNA or synthetic inhibitors decreases the levels of these molecules, inhibits the release of growth factors, and decreases the levels of various signaling pathway molecules, thereby leading to the inhibition of angiogenesis. Furthermore, MMPs degrade specific substrates and release angiogenic inhibitors which inhibit angiogenesis. Downregulation of 2 molecules, such as uPA and uPAR, uPAR and MMP-9, or Cathepsin B and MMP-9, are more effective to inhibit angiogenesis rather than downregulation of single molecules. However, careful testing of these combinations are most important because multiple effects of these combinations play a significant role in angiogenesis.",

Ganglioglioma grade I is a rare, circumscribed, glioneuronal tumor of the central nervous system (CNS) that occurs most often in young patients, most frequently in the temporal lobe and presents with seizures (1). The neuronal component consists of ganglion cells, abnormally grouped and occasionally binucleated. The glial component consists of piloid or fibrillary astrocytic elements, or of pseudo-oligodendroglial elements. Mitoses are occasional and necrosis is absent. Eosinophilic granular bodies (EGB) and perivascular lymphocytes are associated (1). The glial component variably expresses GFAP and OLIG2 and the neuronal component variably expresses synaptophysin, chromogranin A and MAP2. The progenitor marker CD34 often shows an extravascular stellar immunostaining (1). Ki67 labelling index is usually less than 3% and p53 immunostaining is negative. The majority of gangliogliomas are benign grade I tumours, however 6% present as grade III anaplastic ganglioglioma or undergo malignant transformation. Markers to predict anaplastic transformation of grade I tumours are poorly defined (1).

The activity of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), which catalyses the rate-limiting step of ceramide synthesis de novo, was remarkably enhanced by THC in C6.9 cells, but not in C6.4 cells. However, no major changes in SPT mRNA and protein levels were evident. Changes in SPT activity paralleled changes in ceramide levels. Pharmacological inhibition of ceramide synthesis de novo also prevented the stimulation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase and the inhibition of protein kinase B triggered by cannabinoids. These findings show that de novo-synthesized ceramide is involved in cannabinoid-induced apoptosis of glioma cells.",

Among them it has been observed that aberrant PDGF signalling is frequently linked to glioma development and progression, and Pdgf-b over-expression in mouse neural progenitors leads to the formation of gliomas. Despite this evidence, the mechanisms underlying PDGF-B driven tumorigenesis and its role during brain development are not fully understood. In order to contribute to clarifying possible new roles of pdgf-b signalling, we present here the embryonic gene expression pattern of pdgf-b, so far unknown in early vertebrate development. By using Xenopus laevis as a model system we performed qRT-PCR and whole mount in situ hybridization. Pdgf-b mRNA is expressed in discrete regions of the developing central nervous system, in the cranial nerve placodes and in the notochord. We also compared the gene expression of pdgf-b with that of its receptor pdgfr-α suggesting so far unsuspected roles for this signalling pathway during the development of specific embryonic structures.

A variant of wt-DA (designated DA-P12) generated during the 12th passage of persistent infection of a G26-20 glioma cell line failed to persist and induce demyelination in SJL/J mice. To identify the determinants responsible for this change in phenotype, we sequenced the capsid coding sequence (nucleotides [nt] 2991 to 3994) and found three mutations in VP1: residues 99 (Gly to Ser), 100 (Gly to Asp), and 103 (Asn to Lys). To study the role of these mutations in neurovirulence and demyelination, we prepared a recombinant virus, DAP-1C-2A/DA, with replacement of wt-DA nt 2991 to 3994 with the corresponding region of DA-P12, and viruses with individual point mutations at VP1 residues 99(Ser), 100(Asp), and 103(Lys). DAP-1C-2A/DA and viruses with a mutation at VP1 residue 99 or 100 (but not 103) completely attenuated the ability of wt-DA to induce demyelination. Failure to induce demyelination was not due to a general failure in growth, since DA-P12 and other mutant viruses lysed L-2 cells in vitro as effectively as wt-DA. The change in disease phenotype was independent of the specific B- or T-cell immune recognition because a decrease in the neurovirulence of mutant viruses was observed in neonatal mice and immune-deficient RAG1 -/- mice. This difference in neurovirulence is not the complete explanation for the failure of DA-P12 to demyelinate, since virus with a mutation at residue 103(Lys) had decreased neurovirulence but did induce demyelination. Therefore, point mutation at VP1 residue 99 or 100 altered the ability of wt-DA to demyelinate, perhaps related to a disruption in interaction between virus and receptor on certain neural cells.",

The mechanism by which CIL-102 inhibits growth remains poorly understood in human astrocytoma cells. Herein, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which CIL-102 affects the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell cycle G2/M arrest in glioma cells. Treatment of U87 cells with 1.0μM CIL-102 resulted in phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK1/2), downregulation of cell cycle-related proteins (cyclin A, cyclin B, cyclin D1, and cdk1), and phosphorylation of cdk1Tyr(15) and Cdc25cSer(216). Furthermore, treatment with the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 abolished CIL-102-induced Cdc25cSer(216) expression and reversed CIL-102-inhibited cdk1 activation. In addition, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, blocked cell cycle G2/M arrest and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Cdc25cSer(216) in U87 cells. CIL-102-mediated ERK1/2 and ROS production, and cell cycle arrest were blocked by treatment with specific inhibitors. In conclusion, we have identified a novel CIL-102-inhibited proliferation in U87 cells by activating the ERK1/2 and Cdc25cSer(216) cell cycle-related proteins and inducing ROS production; this might be a new mechanism in human astrocytoma cells.",

Neurologic dose-limiting toxicity developed in 3 patients; however, none required further surgery to debulk radiation necrosis. Median survival was 88.6 wk and 65.0 wk for newly diagnosed and recurrent patients, respectively.;The MTD of (131)I-ch81C6 is 2.96 GBq (80 mCi) because of dose-limiting hematologic toxicity.

To extend these findings and to uncover the underlying mechanisms, the ensuing experiments were undertaken. We hypothesized that immunizations combining both GM-CSF and IFNgamma systemically would increase the number of immature myeloid cells, which then would mature and differentiate into dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, thereby augmenting tumor antigen presentation and T-cell activation. Indeed, the combined therapy induced a systemic increase of both immature and mature myeloid cells but also an increase in T regulatory cells (T-regs). Cytotoxic anti-tumor responses, mirrored by an increase in Granzyme B-positive cells as well as IFNgamma-producing T-cells, were augmented after immunizations with GM-CSF and IFNgamma. We also show that the combined therapy induced a long-term memory with rejection of intracerebral (i.c.) rechallenges. Depletion of T-cells showed that both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were essential for the combined GM-CSF and IFNgamma effect. Finally, when immunizations were delayed until day 5 after tumor inoculation, only mice receiving immunotherapy with both GM-CSF and IFNgamma survived. We conclude that the addition of recombinant IFNgamma to immunizations with GM-CSF producing tumor cells increased the number of activated tumoricidal T-cells, which could eradicate established intracerebral tumors. These results clearly demonstrate that the combination of cytokines in immunotherapy of brain tumors have synergistic effects that have implications for clinical immunotherapy of human malignant brain tumors.",

We also explored its localization mechanism using Cu(DOTA-LRB) as the fluorescent probe in both the U87MG human glioma cell line and the cultured primary U87MG glioma cells. It was found that (64)Cu(DOTA-LRB) had the highest tumor uptake (6.54 ± 1.50, 6.91 ± 1.26, 5.68 ± 1.13, 7.58 ± 1.96, and 5.14 ± 1.50%ID/g at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 h postinjection, respectively) among many (64)Cu-labeled organic cations evaluated in the same animal model. The cellular staining study indicated that Cu(DOTA-LRB) was able to localize in mitochondria of U87MG glioma cells due to the enhanced negative mitochondrial potential. This statement is completely supported by the results from decoupling experiment with carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). MicroPET data showed that the U87MG glioma tumors were clearly visualized as early as 30 min postinjection with (64)Cu(DOTA-LRB). (64)Cu(DOTA-LRB) remained stable during renal excretion, but underwent extensive degradation during hepatobiliary excretion.

The high specificity of this fusion to PA when compared with other CNS tumors has diagnostic utility. In addition, the frequency of alteration of this key pathway provides an opportunity for molecularly targeted therapy in this tumor.

        "Doc_abstract":"Some of the pathological features of 112 cerebellar astrocytomas seen at The Radcliffe Infirmary between 1938 and 1984 have been described. These include the following: Macroscopic appearance: Cerebellar astrocytomas, when compared to other gliomas, have an unusual tendency to become cystic. Thus, if all ages are considered only 22% are total solid tumors while the others have either a large solitary cyst or many smaller ones. Although patients with cystic tumors remain free of recurrence far longer than those with totally solid astrocytomas, the proportion of cystic and solid elements does not significantly influence the overall survival period. Moreover, the degree of tumor demarcation is not an absolute indicator of the degree of malignancy. Extent of disease: Approximately 8% of cerebellar astrocytomas infiltrate the brainstem and these cases are associated with the poorest prognosis. Supratentorial invasion is very rare and CSF dissemination is very uncommon. Only one example of the latter was recorded in the present study. It is important to note that subarachnoid spread may also occur from histologically benign tumors as well as malignant cerebellar astrocytomas. Classification by growth pattern: The classification of cerebellar astrocytomas by \"growth pattern\" is clearly of limited use. This is due to the presence of substantial transitional forms in both the \"juvenile\" and \"diffuse\" as well as in the \"fibrillary\" and \"protoplasmic\" classifications. Confusion also arises because of the disregard for the quantity and distribution of certain features which, in turn, limits the usefulness of the \"A\" and \"B\" type classification system. Failure to define rigorously the cell type which predominates in the \"cerebral\" and \"diffuse\" forms also creates substantial difficulties in using Ringertz' nomenclature. Further problems are caused by Zülich's \"polar spongioblastomas\" since cerebellar astrocytomas are not composed of primitive spongioblasts, the \"polar spongioblastomas\" merely representing one subtype of cerebellar astrocytoma, namely the piloid or pilocytic variety. Attempts to classify cerebellar astrocytomas in a manner which does not rely upon any specific cell type but which depends instead upon the degree of homogeneity or heterogeneity of cell growth is of limited value. Grading schemes: Although the tumors studied in the present report were not graded, previous authors have shown that \"grading schemes\" are of little predictive value in assessing the behavior of cerebellar astrocytomas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "Doc_abstract":"Three types of ionic current essentially determine the firing pattern of nerve cells: the persistent Na+ current, the M current and the low-voltage-activated Ca(2)+ current. The present article summarizes recent experiments concerned with the basic properties of these currents. Keynes and Meves (Proc R Soc Lond B (1993) 253, 61-68) studied the persistent or steady-state Na+ current on dialysed squid axons and measured the probability of channel opening both for the peak and the steady-state Na+ current (PF(peak) and PF(ss)) as a function of voltage. Whereas PF(peak) starts to rise at -50 mV and reaches a maximum at +40 to +50 mV, PF(ss) only begins to rise appreciably at around 0 mV and is still increasing at +100 mV. This differs from observations on vertebrate excitable tissues where the persistent Na+ current tums on in the threshold region and saturates at around 0 mV. Schmitt and Meves (Pflugers Arch (1993) 425, 134-139) recorded M current, a non-inactivating K+ current, from NGI08-15 neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells, voltage-clamped in the whole-cell mode, and studied the effects of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB), an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), and arachidonic acid (AA). PDB and AA both decreased I(M), the effective concentrations being 0.1-1 mu M and 5-25 mu M, respectively; while the PDB effect was regularly observed, the M current depression by AA was highly variable from cell to cell. The PKC 19-31 peptide, an effective inhibitor of PKC, in a concentration of 1 muM almost totally prevented the effects of PDB and AA on M current, suggesting that both are mediated by PKC. Schmitt and Meves (Pflugers Arch (1994a) 426, Suppl R 59) measured low-voltage-activated (l-v-a) and high-voltage-activated (h-v-a) Ca2+ currents on NG108-15 cells and investigated the effect of AA and PDB on both types of current. At pulse potentials > -20 mV, AA (25-100 mu M) decreased 1-v-a and h-v-a I(Ca). The decrease was accompanied by a small negative shift and a slight flattening of the activation and inactivation curves of the l-v-a I(Ca). The AA effect was not prevented by 50 mu M eicosa-5,8,11,14-tetraynoic acid (ETYA), an inhibitor of AA metabolism, or PKC 19-31 peptide and not mimicked by 0.1-1 mu M PDB. Probably, AA acts directly on the channel protein or its lipid environment. The physiological relevance of these three sets of observations is briefly discussed.",

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether its efficacy could be enhanced by an X-ray boost administered after BNCT. Two brain tumor models were used, the F98 glioma as a model for primary brain tumors and the MRA 27 human melanoma as a model for metastatic brain tumors.;For biodistribution studies, either 10(5) F98 glioma cells were implanted stereotactically into the brains of syngeneic Fischer rats or 10(6) MRA 27 melanoma cells were implanted intracerebrally into National Institutes of Health (NIH)-rnu nude rats. Biodistribution studies were performed 11-13 days after implantation of the F98 glioma and 20-24 days after implantation of the MRA 27 melanoma. Animals bearing the F98 glioma received a combination of two boron-containing drugs, sodium borocaptate at a dose of 30 mg/kg and boron phenylalanine (BPA) at a dose of 250 mg/kg. MRA 27 melanoma-bearing rats received BPA (500 mg/kg) containing an equivalent amount of 10B (27 mg B/kg). The drugs were administered by either intracarotid or i.v. injection.;The tumor boron concentration after intracarotid injection was approximately 50% greater in the F98 glioma and MRA 27 melanoma after intracarotid injection (20.8 and 36.8 microg/g, respectively) compared with i.v. injection (11.2 and 19.5 microg/g, respectively). BNCT was carried out at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Medical Research Reactor approximately 14 days after tumor implantation of either the F98 glioma or the MRA 27 melanoma. Approximately 7-10 days after BNCT, subsets of animals were irradiated with 6-MV photons, produced by a linear accelerator at a total dose of 15 Gy, delivered in 5-Gy daily fractions. F98 glioma-bearing rats that received intracarotid or i.v. sodium borocaptate plus BPA, followed 2.5 h later by BNCT and 7-10 days later by X-rays, had similar mean survival times (61 days and 53 days, respectively, p = 0.25), and the non X-irradiated, BNCT-treated animals had a mean survival time of 52 and 40 days, respectively, for intracarotid vs. i.v. injection; the latter was equivalent to that of the irradiated animals. The corresponding survival time for MRA 27 melanoma-bearing rats that received intracarotid or i.v. BPA, followed by BNCT and then X-irradiation, was 75 and 82 days, respectively (p = 0.5), 54 days without X-irradiation (p = 0.0002), 37 days for X-irradiation alone, and 24 days for untreated controls. In contrast to the data obtained with the F98 glioma, MRA 27 melanoma-bearing rats that received i.v. BPA, followed by BNCT, had a highly significant difference in mean survival time compared with the irradiated controls (54 vs. 37 days, p = 0.008).;Our data are the first to suggest that a significant therapeutic gain may be obtained when BNCT is combined with an X-ray boost. Additional experimental studies are required to determine the optimal combination of X-radiation and neutron doses and whether it is more advantageous to administer the photon boost before or after BNCT.",

To gain additional mechanistic insight into the efficacy of this approach, we have treated mice bearing the MCA205 (H-2(b)) or CMS-4 (H-2(d)) sarcomas. IL-12/23 p40(-/-) and IFN-gamma(-/-) mice, which were able to reject the initial inoculation of IL-4 expressing tumors, failed to mount a sustained systemic response against parental (nontransfected) tumor cells. Paracrine production of IL-4 in vaccine sites promoted the accumulation and maturation of IL-12p70-secreting tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells (TIDCs). Adoptive transfer of TIDCs isolated from vaccinated wild-type, but not IL-12/23 p40(-/-), mice were capable of promoting tumor-specific CTL responses in syngeneic recipient animals. Interestingly, both STAT4(-/-) and STAT6(-/-) mice failed to reject IL-4-transfected tumors in concert with the reduced capacity of TIDCs to produce IL-12p70 and to promote specific antitumor CTL reactivity. These results suggest that vaccines consisting of tumor cells engineered to produce the type 2 cytokine, IL-4, critically depend on type 1 immunity for their observed therapeutic efficacy.",

Here, we demonstrate that the simultaneous, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of uPAR and cathepsin B inhibits glioma cell migration and is accompanied by cytoskeletal condensation. We show that the dephosphorylation of cofilin is inhibited by the down-regulation of uPAR alone and, to a lesser extent, by the down-regulation of cathepsin B alone, and that the effect was much higher with the down-regulation of both molecules by pUC. Using FACS analysis and western blotting for the alphaVbeta3 integrin heterodimer, we determined that down-regulating uPAR subsequently causes the down-regulation of the alphaVbeta3 integrin heterodimer. As evidenced by western blot analysis of ERK1/2, pERK1/2, p38MAPK, p-p38MAPK, AKT, pAKT and PI3-k, the MEK and PI3-k pathways are inhibited. From cytoskeleton studies, we observed that the down-regulation of uPAR caused cytoskeletal condensation and that the simultaneous down-regulation of uPAR and cathepsin B was even more effective at inducing cytoskeletal condensation than uPAR alone.

This study assesses grading of astrocytomas based on Raman spectroscopy for a future application in intra-surgical guidance. Our predictive classification models distinguish the surgically relevant classes \"normal tissue\" and \"low\" and \"high grade astrocytoma\" in Raman maps of moist bulk samples (80 patients) acquired with a fibre-optic probe. We introduce partial class memberships as a strategy to utilize borderline cases for classification. Borderline cases supply the most valuable training and test data for our application. They are (a) examples of the sought boundary and (b) the cases for which new diagnostics are needed. Besides, the number of suitable training samples increases considerably: soft logistic regression (LR) utilizes 85% more spectra and 50% more patients than linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The predictive soft LR models achieve ca. 85, 67 and 84% (normal, low and high grade) sensitivity and specificity. We discuss the different heuristics of LR and LDA in the light of borderline samples. While we focus on prediction, the spectroscopic interpretation of the predictive models agrees with previous descriptive studies. Unsaturated lipids are used to differentiate between normal and tumour tissues, while the total lipid content prominently contributes to the determination of the tumour grade. The high-wavenumber region above 2,800 cm(-1) alone did not allow successful grading. We give a proof of concept for Raman spectroscopic grading of moist astrocytoma tissues and propose to include borderline samples into classifier training and testing.",

Also, in the specimens, in which Leu 1+ cells and Leu M5+ cells infiltrate, simultaneous detection of Leu 2a, Leu 3a + 3b, or Leu M5 and HLA-DR, was performed by double immunofluorescence staining to analyze the T cell activation and antigen-present macrophage (M phi).

Our recent study suggested that Akt is a crucial mediator of apoptosis sensitivity in response to ABT-737 in glioma cell lines. Inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt are currently being assessed clinically in patients with glioma. Because PI3K/Akt inhibition would be expected to have many proapoptotic effects, we hypothesized that there may be unique synergy between PI3K inhibitors and Bcl-2 homology 3 mimetics. Toward this end, we assessed the combination of the PI3K/Akt inhibitor NVP-BKM120 [5-(2,6-dimorpholinopyrimidin-4-yl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-amine] and the Bcl-2 family inhibitor ABT-737 in established and primary cultured glioma cells. We found that the combined treatment with these agents led to a significant activation of caspase-8 and -3, PARP, and cell death, irrespective of PTEN status. The enhanced lethality observed with this combination also appears dependent on the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c, smac/DIABLO, and apoptosis-inducing factor to the cytosol. Further study revealed that the upregulation of Noxa, truncation of Bid, and activation of Bax and Bak caused by these inhibitors were the key factors for the synergy. In addition, we demonstrated the release of proapoptotic proteins Bim and Bak from Mcl-1. We found defects in chromosome segregation leading to multinuclear cells and loss of colony-forming ability, suggesting the potential use of NVP-BKM120 as a promising agent to improve the anticancer activities of ABT-737.

The main facts concerning histological type, topography of the tumour, date of diagnosis, address, profession, O.B.O. and Rhesus groups, age and sex were codified for feeding into a computer and processed by sophisticated statistical methods. This analysis shows the homogeneity of topographical distribution in the brain of the different types of glioma, the special genetic code of meningiomas (predominance of A and B genes of the A.B.O. group), absence of the same factors for glioblastoma. Sex ratio analysis shows the contrast between definitely masculine tumours--glioblastomas and astrocytomas--and meningiomas and spongioblastomas. Analysis of the \"age specific rate\" separates tumours prevalent in the young, where incidence is a decreasing function of age (spongioblastoma, medulloblastoma, cerebellar astrocytoma) and tumours prevalent in adults which are mainly meningiomas and glioblastomas whose incidence is an increasing exponential function of age. Epidemiological analysis shows the difference in geographical distribution of glioblastomas and meningiomas. As far as glioblastomas are concerned, it would appear that on to the general rule of constant tumourincidence over the area as a whole, is superimposed another of high incidence in particular districts of the Beaujolais and Maconnais regions. The aetiological implications of these various findings are discussed.",

The ability to detect these enzymes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) would be a minimally invasive method of evaluating brain tumors.;CSF from 66 patients with white blood cell counts of < or = 5 microL were analyzed for the presence of gelatinolytic activity by zymography. Twenty-nine patients had malignant astrocytomas, 10 had brain metastases from systemic malignancies, 4 had systemic cancer not involving the central nervous system, 4 had nonmalignant neurologic diseases, and 19 were healthy controls. Fifteen CSF samples had positive cytologies. The zymographic results were retrospectively correlated with clinical information and CSF cytologic data.;CSF from all patients with malignant astrocytomas or brain metastases contained precursor gelatinase A (pMMP2) and precursor gelatinase B (pMMP9), whereas control CSF contained only pMMP2. All patients with positive CSF cytologies had activated MMP2. A similar correlation was observed between the presence of activated MMP9 and positive CSF cytology.;The precursor and activated forms of gelatinases A and B can be detected in the CSF of patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors. The distribution of gelatinase activity in CSF distinguishes patients with malignant gliomas or brain metastases from those without brain tumors, and distinguishes patients with meningeal carcinomatosis from those without CSF spread of tumor, regardless of their brain tumor status.

This compound administered orally in the rat glioma model has potent activity in treating fully formed gliomas. In this report observations made on the PBN-nitrones in experimental cancer models will be summarized. In addition the experimental results will be discussed in the general framework of the properties of the compounds with a view to try to understand the mechanistic basis of how the PBN-nitrones act as anti-cancer agents.

PHF20 appears to be a novel antigen in glioma, and has also termed glioma-expressed antigen 2. PHF20 is thought to contribute to the development of cancers, including glioblastoma, lung cancer, colon cancer and ovarian cancer. However, little is known about the function of PHF20 in various cancers. Here we report that PHF20 contains two consensus sites for protein kinase B (PKB) phosphorylation (RxRxxS/T). PKB can directly phosphorylate PHF20 on Ser291 in vitro and in vivo. It has been shown that PKB participates in the tumor suppressor p53 regulated gene expression program and has a direct effect on p21 regulation after DNA damage. UV-induced DNA damage results in accumulation of p53 and PKB activation. Interestingly, PKB-mediated PHF20 phosphorylation led to an inhibition of p53 induction following UV treatment, leading to the reduction of p21 transcriptional activity. Using anti PHF20 and anti pPKB (S473) antibodies, these events were mapped in various human cancer tissues. Taken together, these data suggest that PHF20 is a novel substrate for PKB and its phosphorylation by PKB plays an important role in tumorigenesis via regulating of p53 mediated signaling.",

SREBP1a can also activate the transcription of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) by binding to its promoter region. IDH1 mutations, especially R132H mutation of IDH1, are a common feature of a major subset of human gliomas. There are few data available on the relationship between mutational IDH1 expression and SREBP1a pathway. In this study, we investigated cellular effects and SREBP1a pathway alterations caused by R132H mutational IDH1 expression in U87 cells. Two glioma cell lines, stably expressing mutational (U87/R132H) or wild type (U87/wt) IDH1, were established. A cell line, stably transfected with pcDNA3.1(+) (U87/vector), was generated as a control. Click-iT EdU assay, sulforhodamine B assay, and wound healing assay respectively showed that the expression of R132H induced cellular proliferation, cell growth, and cell migration. Western blot revealed that SREBP1 was increased in U87/R132H compared with that in U87/wt. Elevated SREBP1a and several its target genes, but not SREBP1c, were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction in U87/R132H. All these findings indicated that R132H mutational IDH1 is involved in the regulation of proliferation, growth, and migration of glioma cells.

Infiltrates in gliomas consist almost exclusively of T-cells of the suppressor/cytotoxic type whereas infiltrates in carcinoma metastases and craniopharyngeomas contain considerable numbers of T-helper/inducer cells and B-cells. From this the authors conclude (1) that NK cells do not play a major role in tumor rejection, and (2) that the kind of inflammatory reaction does not depend upon the tumor site but more likely on the tumor type.

        "Doc_abstract":"The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway is an important regulator of a wide spectrum of tumor-related biological processes, including cell proliferation, survival, and motility, as well as neovascularization. Protein kinase B/Akt is activated in a complex manner through the phosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt on Thr308 and Ser473. Although protein-dependent kinase-1 has been shown to phosphorylate Akt at Thr308, it is not clear whether there is a distinct kinase that exclusively phosphorylates Akt at Ser473. A possible candidate is integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which has been shown to phosphorylate Akt at Ser473 in vitro. ILK is a multidomain focal adhesion protein that is believed to be involved in signal transmission from integrin and growth factor receptors. Further, ILK is implicated in the regulation of anchorage-dependent cell growth/survival, cell cycle progression, invasion and migration, and tumor angiogenesis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that ILK inhibition would inhibit these processes in gliomas in which it is constitutively expressed. We found that a newly developed small-molecule compound (QLT0267) effectively inhibited signaling through the ILK/Akt cascade in glioma cells by blocking the phosphorylation of Akt and downstream targets, including mammalian target of rapamycin and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. Treatment of glioma cells with 12.5 micromol/L QLT0267 inhibited cell growth by 50% at 48 hours. An anchorage-dependent cell growth assay confirmed the cell growth-inhibitory effect of QLT0267. Further, the decrease in cell growth was associated with a dramatic accumulation of cells in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle. Although the cell growth-inhibitory effects of the ILK inhibitor were achieved only at a high concentration, the QLT0267 was able to reduce cellular invasion and angiogenesis at much lower concentrations as shown by in vitro invasion assays and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion. Thus, blocking the ILK/Akt pathway is a potential strategy for molecular targeted therapy for gliomas.",

To further investigate the significance of PDGF stimulation in brain tumors, we used a previously developed mouse tumor model, in which malignant brain tumors of neuroepithelial origin were induced by injecting a murine retrovirus containing the human PDGF B-chain gene into the brains of neonatal mice. In the present investigation, we have characterized a cell line established from such an experimentally induced tumor in an INK4a-/- mouse. Cultured tumor cells expressed nestin and NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and are thus most likely derived from an oligodendrocyte precursor cell. Tumor cells produced PDGF-B protein and displayed constitutively activated PDGF alpha receptors. Autocrine receptor activation could be blocked with the specific PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor CGP 57148B, which led to almost complete inhibition of cell proliferation, which was much less affected by a PDGF B-chain aptamer that inhibits binding of PDGF-B to PDGF receptors and is unlikely to be able to pass through the plasma membrane.

Contrast with white matter and ADC values for tumor components with available histology were also evaluated.;Twenty patients with clinical and routine MR imaging/CT evidence of intracerebral neoplasm were examined with routine MR imaging and echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging. The routine MR imaging included at least the axial T2-weighted fast spin-echo and axial T1-weighted spin-echo sequences before and after contrast enhancement. The diffusion-weighted imaging included an echo-planar spin-echo sequence with three b values (0, 300, and 1200 s/mm(2)), sensitizing gradient in the z direction, and calculated ADC maps. The visual comparison of routine MR images with diffusion-weighted images for tumor delineation was performed as was the statistical analysis of quantitative diffusion-weighted imaging parameters with histologic evaluation.;For tumors, the diffusion-weighted images and ADC maps of gliomas were less useful than the T2-weighted spin-echo and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo images in definition of tumor boundaries. Additionally, in six cases of gliomas, neither T2-weighted spin-echo nor diffusion-weighted images were able to show a boundary between tumor and edema, which was present on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and/or perfusion echo-planar images. The ADC values of solid gliomas, metastases, and meningioma were in the same range. In two cases of lymphomas, there was a good contrast with white matter, with strongly reduced ADC values. For infection, the highest contrast on diffusion-weighted images and lowest ADC values were observed in association with inflammatory granuloma and abscess.;Contrary to the findings of previous studies, we found no clear advantage of diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging in the evaluation of tumor extension. The contrast between gliomas, metastases, meningioma, and white matter was generally lower on diffusion-weighted images and ADC maps compared with conventional MR imaging. Unlike gliomas, the two cases of lymphomas showed hyperintense signal on diffusion-weighted images whereas the case of cerebral abscess showed the highest contrast on diffusion-weighted images with very low ADC values.

        "Doc_abstract":"Chronic treatment of neuroblastoma X glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells with the opiate agonist etorphine resulted in a decrease in both opiate receptor density (receptor down-regulation) and opiate ability to inhibit prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)-stimulated increases in cyclic AMP levels (receptor desensitization). Opiate receptor down-regulation and desensitization were homologous as indicated by the lack of apparent change in muscarinic, alpha 2-adrenergic, and PGE1 receptor binding and also retention, albeit modulation, of the ability of carbachol and norepinephrine to inhibit PGE1-stimulated increases in cyclic AMP levels after 24 hr of etorphine treatment. PGE1-stimulated increases in cyclic AMP levels remained identical in etorphine-treated and control cells. Several lines of evidence indicate that receptor desensitization and receptor down-regulation in NG108-15 cells are two separate cellular adaptation processes. (a) With an agonist which appears to be efficiently coupled, i.e., an agonist whose apparent Kd value is much larger than its apparent IC50 value for regulation of cyclic AMP levels (Ki), the concentration of ligand required to produce half-maximal down-regulation is analogous to its Ki value, whereas the concentration of ligand required to produce half-maximal desensitization is related to its Kd value; (b) receptor desensitization precedes receptor down-regulation; (c) only opiate agonists could produce receptor down-regulation, whereas both opiate agonists and partial agonists could desensitize post-receptor occupancy events. Still further evidence for dissociability of these processes was obtained by incubating NG108-15 cells with etorphine at 30 degrees for 2 hr. Under these conditions, there was a decrease in etorphine's ability to regulate adenylate cyclase while [3H]diprenorphine binding remained unaltered. IC50 values of D-Ala2-D-Leu5-enkephalin's competition for [3H]diprenorphine binding to intact cells increased 19.6-fold after etorphine treatment for 90 min, while naloxone IC50 values remained unaltered. This apparent increase in IC50 values was much lower, about 2-fold, when receptor binding was carried out in membranes isolated from cells treated with etorphine chronically. Furthermore, analysis of [3H]etorphine binding to such membranes in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+ indicated a loss of receptor binding sites with no change in apparent affinity, whereas [3H]diprenorphine binding revealed no significant alteration in either Bmax or Kd values. Therefore, during opiate receptor desensitization, a reduction of agonist high-affinity site occurs with no apparent alteration in total receptor number.",

        "Doc_abstract":"We previously identified SIRT2, an nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent tubulin deacetylase, as a protein downregulated in gliomas and glioma cell lines, which are characterized by aneuploidy. Other studies reported SIRT2 to be involved in mitotic progression in the normal cell cycle. We herein investigated whether SIRT2 functions in the mitotic checkpoint in response to mitotic stress caused by microtubule poisons. By monitoring chromosome condensation, the exogenously expressed SIRT2 was found to block the entry to chromosome condensation and subsequent hyperploid cell formation in glioma cell lines with a persistence of the cyclin B/cdc2 activity in response to mitotic stress. SIRT2 is thus a novel mitotic checkpoint protein that functions in the early metaphase to prevent chromosomal instability (CIN), characteristics previously reported for the CHFR protein. We further found that histone deacetylation, but not the aberrant DNA methylation of SIRT2 5'untranslated region is involved in the downregulation of SIRT2. Although SIRT2 is normally exclusively located in the cytoplasm, the rapid accumulation of SIRT2 in the nucleus was observed after treatment with a nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin B and ionizing radiation in normal human fibroblasts, suggesting that nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling regulates the SIRT2 function. Collectively, our results suggest that the further study of SIRT2 may thus provide new insights into the relationships among CIN, epigenetic regulation and tumorigenesis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are found at a relatively high frequency in glioma, with the most common being the de2-7 EGFR (or EGFRvIII). This mutation arises from an in-frame deletion of exons 2-7, which removes 267 amino acids from the extracellular domain of the receptor. Despite being unable to bind ligand, the de2-7 EGFR is constitutively active and imparts a significant in vivo growth advantage to glioma cells. In order to examine the signalling pathways activated by the de2-7 EGFR and its biological effects in an in vitro system, the de2-7 EGFR gene was transfected into the murine IL-3-dependent pro-B-cell line BaF/3. Expression of the de2-7 EGFR enhanced the survival of BaF/3 cells in the absence of IL-3 by reducing apoptosis in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)-dependent manner. Interestingly, while de2-7 EGFR also enhanced proliferation of BaF/3 cells in low levels of IL-3, this effect was independent of PI3-K. Survival and proliferation were further enhanced when BaF/3 cells were cotransfected with the de2-7 and wt EGFR. This was due to heterodimerization between the de2-7 and wt EGFR leading to trans-phosphorylation of the wt EGFR. This observation is directly relevant to glioma where de2-7 and wt EGFR appear to be coexpressed. Thus, expression of de2-7 EGFR in BaF/3 cells provides an in vitro model for evaluating the signalling pathways activated by this receptor.",

Treatment with lovastatin resulted in the induction of LPS/IFN-gamma-mediated iNOS mRNA and increased nitric oxide (NO) production. The addition of mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) reversed the lovastatin-mediated effect, whereas FPP had no effect. An inhibitor of geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor (GGTI 298) further induced the cytokine and lovastatin-mediated iNOS expression, suggesting the involvement of geranylgeranylated proteins in the regulation of iNOS. Bacterial toxin B (inactivates RhoA, B, and C; CDC42; Rac proteins), C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase (C3) toxin from C. botulinum (inactivates RhoA, B, and C proteins), and Y-27632 (selective inhibitor of Rho-associated kinases) increased the LPS/IFN-gamma-mediated iNOS expression. Lovastatin treatment induced NO by increasing NF-kappaB translocation and its association with the CREB-binding protein (CBP/p300) via the downregulation of RhoA. Inhibition of RhoA resulted in increased activation of IKKalpha. Cotransfection studies with dominant-negative form of RhoA and iNOS-luciferase or NF-kappaB-luciferase reporter constructs further support these observations. Taken together, these studies show that downregulation of RhoA by lovastatin resulted in increased iNOS expression via the activation of NF-kappaB-CBP/p300 pathway in transformed brain cells.",

In contrast to adult GBM, few molecular prognostic markers for the pediatric counterpart have been established. We, therefore, investigated the prognostic significance of genomic and epigenetic alterations through molecular analysis of 202 pedGBM (1-18 years) with comprehensive clinical annotation. Routinely prepared formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples were assessed for genome-wide DNA methylation profiles, with known candidate genes screened for alterations via direct sequencing or FISH. Unexpectedly, a subset of histologically diagnosed GBM (n = 40, 20 %) displayed methylation profiles similar to those of either low-grade gliomas or pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXA). These tumors showed a markedly better prognosis, with molecularly PXA-like tumors frequently harboring BRAF V600E mutations and 9p21 (CDKN2A) homozygous deletion. The remaining 162 tumors with pedGBM molecular signatures comprised four subgroups: H3.3 G34-mutant (15 %), H3.3/H3.1 K27-mutant (43 %), IDH1-mutant (6 %), and H3/IDH wild-type (wt) GBM (36 %). These subgroups were associated with specific cytogenetic aberrations, MGMT methylation patterns and clinical outcomes. Analysis of follow-up data identified a set of biomarkers feasible for use in risk stratification: pedGBM with any oncogene amplification and/or K27M mutation (n = 124) represents a particularly unfavorable group, with 3-year overall survival (OS) of 5 %, whereas tumors without these markers (n = 38) define a more favorable group (3-year OS ~70 %).Combined with the lower grade-like lesions, almost 40 % of pedGBM cases had distinct molecular features associated with a more favorable outcome. This refined prognostication method for pedGBM using a molecular risk algorithm may allow for improved therapeutic choices and better planning of clinical trial stratification for this otherwise devastating disease.",

When C6 cultures were exposed to 0.01 to 10 muM BCNU, the growth rates decreased for 2 days as control cell populations continued to proliferate at log phase rates. These growth-inhibitory responses were dose dependent and ranged from 20 to 80%, relative to control growth. Subsequently, the growth rates increased and the inhibitory responses ranged from 0 to 12% 4 days later. Cell densities in C6 cultures exposed to 1 muM dexamethasone for 1 day did not differ significantly from controls. Then cell proliferation ceased and the inhibitory response remained at 50% relative to controls in stationary phase. When 0.03 muM BCNU and 1 muM dexamethasone were supplied simultaneously to C6 cultures, a 35% inhibitory response occurred after 1 day. This response did not differ significantly from that observed with 0.03 muM BCNU alone. After 4 days, the inhibitory response did not decrease in cultures containing both drugs, but did decrease to 13% in the 0.03 muM BCNU-treated cultures. In 1 muM BCNU-treated cultures, the response was 66% after 1 day, which decreased to 21% 5 days later. When 1 muM BCNU was supplied to C6 cultures that were pretreated for 1 day with 1 muM dexamethasone, the response was 91% the following day, and this decreased to only 54% 5 days later. Dose-response curves showed that the inhibitory responses after 1 day in these pretreated cultures exposed to 0.001 to 10 muM BCNU increased up to 22% relative to the responses produced by either drug alone. After 5 days, the responses in the pretreated cultures exposed to 0.001 to 1 muM BCNU was 50%, which was similar to the response produced by 1 muM dexamethasone alone. Ultrastructural studies revealed that control and 1 muM BCNU-treated C6 cells contained 18 mitochondria, but the treated cells were 10% smaller after 1 day. Cells exposed to 1 muM dexamethasone for 1 day conount of granular endoplasmic reticulum increased greater than 80% in cells treated with BCNU for 1 day or dexamethasone for 2 days. C6 cells pretreated with dexamethasone and exposed to BCNU for an additional day (a) contained 23 mitochondria, (b) did not decrease in size, and (c) exhibited a greater than 250% increase in the amount of granular endoplasmic reticulum.

Moreover, the effects of CS were also evaluated on endotoxin/cytokine activated glioma iNOS protein expression and MAO enzyme activity. Cigarette smoke condensates (CSCs) were acquired from Marlboro 20 Class A and Kentucky 2R4F reference research (2R4F) cigarettes. The CSCs did not protect against 6-OHDA or H2O2 toxicity in neuroblastoma, and exhibited a very mild protective effect [approximately 10%] against MPP+. Neither CSC demonstrated antioxidant capability, but conversely contained high concentration of NO2-. Paradoxically, in glioma cells, iNOS protein expression and endogenous enzymatic NO2- production were significantly blocked by both CSCs. Both CSCs also inhibited glioma MAO-A and MAO-B [1.4.3.4]. Kinetic analysis indicated that 2R4F-CSC displayed competitive inhibition and the Marlboro-CSC exerted potent competitive and non-competitive inhibition. In conclusion, these data suggest that cigarette smoke does not appear to directly protect against the toxicity of the selected neurotoxins.

TNFR1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and c-Myc mRNA were frequently expressed in malignant astrocytomas, especially in glioblastomas, compared with low-grade astrocytomas by PCR analysis.

Hypoxia, a hallmark of aggressive tumor behavior often noted in GBMs, has been associated with resistance to therapy, poorer survival, and more malignant tumor phenotypes. Based on the existence of a set of novel imaging techniques and modeling tools, our objective was to assess a hypothesized quantitative link between tumor growth kinetics [assessed via mathematical models and routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] and the hypoxic burden of the tumor [assessed via positron emission tomography (PET) imaging]. Our biomathematical model for glioma kinetics describes the spatial and temporal evolution of a glioma in terms of concentration of malignant tumor cells. This model has already been proven useful as a novel tool to dynamically quantify the net rates of proliferation (rho) and invasion (D) of the glioma cells in individual patients. Estimates of these kinetic rates can be calculated from routinely available pretreatment MRI in vivo. Eleven adults with GBM were imaged preoperatively with (18)F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO)-PET and serial gadolinium-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted MRIs to allow the estimation of patient-specific net rates of proliferation (rho) and invasion (D). Hypoxic volumes were quantified from each FMISO-PET scan following standard techniques. To control for tumor size variability, two measures of hypoxic burden were considered: relative hypoxia (RH), defined as the ratio of the hypoxic volume to the T2-defined tumor volume, and the mean intensity on FMISO-PET scaled to the blood activity of the tracer (mean T/B). Pearson correlations between RH and the net rate of cell proliferation (rho) reached significance (P < 0.04). Moreover, highly significant positive correlations were found between biological aggressiveness ratio (rho/D) and both RH (P < 0.00003) and the mean T/B (P < 0.0007).",

In the present study, we examined immunohistochemical expression of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and COX-2 in 45 gastric adenocarcinomas with different tumor grades. Then, adenovirus-mediated small hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vectors rAd5-Akt1+COX-2 (rAd5-A+C) that target sequences of human COX-2 and Akt1 were used to examine the inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis in SGC7901 gastric adenocarcinoma and U251 glioma cells. Cell growth was inhibited by over 70%, as indicated by a MTT assay, and was accompanied by G1/G0 phase arrest in the rAd5-A+C treated group, indicating poor cell growth activities. The number of cells invading through the matrigel in the rAd5-A+C treated group was significantly decreased (36.2+/-3.1) compared with that of the control group SGC7901 (105.0+/-4.0) and the nonsense sequence group rAd5-HK (102.5+/-6.4). In addition, the tumor volumes in the SGC7901 subcutaneous nude mouse model treated with rAd5-A+C was significantly smaller than those of the control group and nonsense sequence group rAd5-HK. When COX-2 and Akt1 were dramatically downregulated, Ki-67, CyclinD1, MMP-2, MMP-9 and Bcl-2 were also downregulated. Our results demonstrated that p-Akt and COX-2 were overexpressed in gastric adenocarcinomas and their expression levels were elevated with the ascending order of tumor malignancy; rAd5-A+C targeting COX-2 and Akt1 downregulated their expression significantly in a sequence-specific manner, exerting inhibitory effects on SGC7901 and U251 cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis. In conclusion, our data suggest a novel mechanism for the regulation of malignant tumor cell growth and provide evidence for combined gene therapy for malignant tumors.",

SSAT levels were downregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels by shRNA-mediated simultaneous knockdown of MMP-9 and uPAR/cathepsin B. In addition, we noted a prominent reduction in the expression of SSAT with MMP-9 and uPAR/cathepsin B knockdown in the tumor regions of 5310 injected nude mice brains. Further, SSAT knockdown in glioma xenograft cells significantly reduced their migration potential. Interestingly, MMP-9, uPAR and cathepsin B overexpression in these xenograft cells significantly elevated SSAT mRNA and protein levels. The migratory potential of MMP-9/uPAR/cathepsin B-overexpressed 4910 and 5310 cells was not affected by either glybenclamide (Kir 6.x inhibitor) or tertiapin-Q (Kir 1.1 and 3.x inhibitor) but instead was significantly inhibited by either barium or Kir4.2 siRNA treatments. Co-localization of α9 integrin with Kir4.2 was observed in both 4910 and 5310 xenograft cells. However, MMP-9 and uPAR/cathepsin B knockdown in these cells prominently reduced the co-localization of α9 with Kir4.2. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that α9β1 integrin-mediated cell migration utilizes SSAT and the Kir4.2 potassium channel pathway, and inhibition of the migratory potential of these glioma xenograft cells by simultaneous knockdown of MMP-9 and uPAR/cathepsin B could be attributed to the reduced SSAT levels and co-localization of α9 integrin with Kir4.2 inward rectifier potassium channels.",

The study included 4 myxopapillary ependymomas (Grade I of the World Health Organization [WHO] scale), 10 subependymomas (WHO Grade I), 17 ependymomas (WHO Grade II), 2 papillary ependymomas (WHO grade II), and 4 anaplastic ependymomas (WHO Grade III). The MIB-1 proliferation index was significantly higher in tumors diagnosed as anaplastic ependymoma (P < .001), with a moderate level of correlation (Kendall's tau-b = 0.557, asymptotic standard error = 108). In addition, one ependymoma (WHO Grade II) not considered overtly anaplastic by routine histologic criteria showed a high MIB-1 labeling index, suggesting that the MIB-1 proliferation index might be a more objective indicator of tumor grade. The remaining WHO Grade I and Grade II ependymomas showed low proliferative activity. bcl-2 oncoprotein expression was identified in all of the four myxopapillary and in both papillary ependymomas. An additional observation was the correlation of p53 expression with increasing WHO grade. These data suggest that high MIB-1 and p53 immunolabeling might be objective indicators of high grade in ependymomas that do not otherwise meet routine histologic criteria for high-grade ependymoma. Subsequent clinicopathologic analyses will be important in assessing whether these markers are useful as independent predictors of survival.",

The aim of the study was to explain the observation that glioblastoma invasion often occurs along existing vasculature, suggesting interactions between the two types of cells. Using the in vitro model, we demonstrate that co-culturing of U87 (human glioblastoma) cells with HMEC-1 (human microvascular endothelial) cells increases the invasiveness of the U87 cells. The enhanced invasiveness correlates with increased expression of MMP-9 in both U87 and HMEC-1 cells, increased expression of cysteine cathepsins B and S and down-regulation of endogenous cell adhesion molecule NCAM in U87 cells. On the other hand, U87 tumour cells significantly enhance the proliferation of co-cultured endothelial cells by a mechanism involving cathepsin B, but not cathepsin S. Furthermore, we demonstrated that increased cell expression and activity of MMP-9 in cell microenvironment is mediated via secretion of SDF-1 by HMEC-1 cells. Selective SDF-1 inhibition impaired the enhanced U87 cell invasion, mostly via down-regulation of MMP-9, but did not alter cathepsin B, although the latter is more relevant for the invasion of U87 cells in mono-culture. Taken together, our study suggests that glioblastoma cells may be attracted by endothelial cells, enhancing their proliferation and underlines the importance of SDF-1, cathepsin B and MMP-9 in the cross-talk between these cells in normoxic conditions. This notion contributes to better understanding and suggests further investigations of the paracrine mechanisms, regulating glioma angiogenesis.",

The reactions of commercially available markers [Ham-56, Mac 387, CD68, CR3/43, DR alpha, lysozyme, CD16, and Ricinus communis agglutinin-1 (RCA-1)] were studied in normal cerebellum, subacute infarcts, viral encephalitis with microglial nodules, radiation necrosis, Alzheimer's disease, medulloblastoma, T-cell lymphoma, oligodendroglioma, gliomatosis cerebri, and microgliomatosis cerebri. We also performed a more extensive investigation of Ham-56 with largely surgical material. We concluded that (a) RCA-1 is a sensitive marker for microglia, either resting or responding to injury, but staining must be interpreted carefully because endothelial cells and reactive astrocytes frequently stain as well. This marker was useful in highlighting focal inflammation in HIV encephalitis. (b) CD68 is a specific marker for resting microglia. A case of microgliomatosis cerebri was intensely stained. (c) Ham-56 is a sensitive, specific (with the exception of endothelial cells), and reliable marker of central nervous system macrophages in routinely processed autopsy and surgical material.

Target validation was established using the thymidine kinase (TK) 1(+) wild-type, murine L929 cell line and its TK1(-) mutant counterpart, which were implanted s.c. (s.c.) into nude mice. Two intratumoral (i.t.) injections of (10)B-enriched N5-2OH were administered to tumor-bearing mice at 2-hour intervals, after which BNCT was carried out at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Research Reactor. Thirty days after BNCT, mice bearing TK1(+) L929 tumors had a 15x reduction in tumor volume compared with TK1(-) controls. Based on these favorable results, BNCT studies were then initiated in rats bearing intracerebral (i.c.) RG2 gliomas, after i.c. administration of N5-2OH by Alzet osmotic pumps, either alone or in combination with i.v. (i.v.) boronophenylalanine (BPA), a drug that has been used clinically.

In the tumor with the largest infiltration (Case 3), inflammatory cells were stained for interferon-gamma, interleukin-2, interleukin-1 beta, lymphotoxin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta. The tumor cells also expressed interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, transforming growth factor-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and prostaglandin E. In contrast, in the tumor with the least inflammatory response (Case 1), the tumor cells did not express any cytokines. Expression of cytokines by glioma cells was modest in the two cases with modest inflammatory responses. Cellular inflammation, primarily consisting of T cells and macrophages with few or no B cells or natural killer cells, was two- to 15-fold greater outside the tumor than within. In contrast to leukocytes outside the tumor, which were activated and expressing class II major histocompatibility antigens, leukocytes within the tumor parenchyma or at the tumor's edge were negative for these antigens. In the four specimens studied here, the tumor cells themselves were also negative for class II major histocompatibility antigens. These findings, although preliminary, suggest that inflammatory cells within gliomas are inactivated and that glioma cells may increase the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines in response to an increased lymphocyte infiltrate.

The safety and general biodistribution patterns of this radiopharmaceutical in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC), small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) or non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), malignant lymphoma, and high-grade gliomas, were demonstrated in this study.;Patients with known primary or suspected metastatic HNSCC, SCLC or NSCLC, malignant lymphoma or high-grade gliomas were dosed with 5.2 MBq/kg of (18)F-FAZA, then scanned 2-3 h after injection using a PET or PET/CT scanner. Images were interpreted by three experienced nuclear medicine physicians. The location and relative uptake scores (graded 0 to 4) of normal and abnormal (18)F-FAZA biodistribution patterns, the calculated tumour-to-background (T/B) ratio, and the maximum standardized uptake value were recorded.;Included in the study were 50 patients (32 men, 18 women). All seven patients with high-grade gliomas showed very high uptake of (18)F-FAZA in the primary tumour. In six out of nine patients with HNSCC, clear uptake of (18)F-FAZA was observed in the primary tumour and/or the lymph nodes in the neck. Of the 21 lymphoma patients (15 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 6 with Hodgkin's disease), 3 demonstrated moderate lymphoma-related uptake. Of the 13 lung cancer patients (12 NSCLC, 1 SCLC), 7 had increased (18)F-FAZA uptake in the primary lung tumour. No side effects of the administration of (18)F-FAZA were observed.;This study suggests that (18)F-FAZA may be a very useful radiopharmaceutical to image hypoxia in the tumour types selected. Especially the high uptake by gliomas was encouraging.

        "Doc_abstract":"BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) therapy for melanoma patients harboring the V600E mutation is initially highly effective, but almost all patients relapse within a few months. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning BRAFi-based therapy is therefore an important issue. Here we identified a previously unsuspected mechanism of BRAFi resistance driven by elevated Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activation that is observed in a cohort of melanoma patients after vemurafenib treatment. Specifically, we demonstrate that melanoma cell lines, with acquired in vitro-induced vemurafenib resistance, show increased levels of glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 and 2 (GLI1/GLI2) compared with naïve cells. We also observed these findings in clinical melanoma specimens. Moreover, the increased expression of the transcription factors GLI1/GLI2 was independent of canonical Hh signaling and was instead correlated with the noncanonical Hh pathway, involving TGFβ/SMAD (transforming growth factor-β/Sma- and Mad-related family) signaling. Knockdown of GLI1 and GLI2 restored sensitivity to vemurafenib-resistant cells, an effect associated with both growth arrest and senescence. Treatment of vemurafenib-resistant cells with the GLI1/GLI2 inhibitor Gant61 led to decreased invasion of the melanoma cells in a three-dimensional skin reconstruct model and was associated with a decrease in metalloproteinase (MMP2/MMP9) expression and microphthalmia transcription factor upregulation. Gant61 monotherapy did not alter the drug sensitivity of naïve cells, but could reverse the resistance of melanoma cells chronically treated with vemurafenib. We further noted that alternating dosing schedules of Gant61 and vemurafenib prevented the onset of BRAFi resistance, suggesting that this could be a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention of therapeutic escape. Our results suggest that targeting the Hh pathway in BRAFi-resistant melanoma may represent a viable therapeutic strategy to restore vemurafenib sensitivity, reducing or even inhibiting the acquired chemoresistance in melanoma patients.Oncogene advance online publication, 17 October 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.348.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The first Klatzo-Lecture pays homage to an exceptional academician, scientist and teacher. The author spent nearly 1 year in Klatzo's laboratory at the NHI in Bethesda, and the first part of results presented here originate directly from this collaboration. It was shown that following cortical injury, movement of edema fluid into the tissue occurs by bulk flow, and that the driving force is a small tissue pressure gradient. Resolution of edema fluid is achieved by clearance into the ventricular and subarachnoid CSF, is enhanced in the presence of pressure gradients and is supported by re-absorption into capillaries. Using appropriate techniques, the formation rate as well as clearance of edema into CSF and tissue resorption could be determined in human brain metastases and malignant gliomas. Three examples of clinical applications based on the discussed mechanisms are presented: a. Fluorescence-guided surgery of gliomas is based on the accumulation of 5-ALA in tumour cells; there being enzymatically converted to PP-IX, a compound with deep red fluorescence. This fluorescence is used for the more accurate surgical removal of gliomas. b. Radioimmunotherapy of gliomas uses an anti-tenascin antibody, coupled with a nuclide, administered postoperatively into the tumour cavity, from where it diffuses into tissue, couples to the receptor at the glioma cells. Then the isotope destroys the tumour cells. c. Convection-enhanced delivery is based on the interstitial infusion of an appropriate cytotoxic drug into the white matter at low pressure. Thus, the method employs bulk flow, distributes a drug in a larger tissue volume and eventually achieves drug concentrations greater than systemic levels. Experimental studies and clinical results are presented for all three clinical applications.I am very grateful to Z. Czernicki and the organizing group for being offered the great honour of presenting the first Igor Klatzo Lecture. In this report first previous results of bulk flow and diffusion in the development and resolution of brain edema will be revisited, then some recent examples will be shown as to how this knowledge of diffusion and bulk flow can be transferred into clinical applications.A great part of the work on bulk flow and diffusion was done during a stay in I. Klatzo's laboratory in Bethesda in 1973/1974 (Fig. 1). Since then a long collaboration developed with I. Klatzo and M. Spatz. Due to given limits, I will concentrate on the studies of our group. Unfortunately it will not be possible to mention all the important groups who have contributed by essential studies.",

Gelatin-affinity chromatography has been employed for the large-scale purification of gelatinases from conditioned medium obtained from cultured cells. The objective of this paper was to develop a rapid method whereby gelatinase activity could be extracted from regional brain tissues without tedious, intervening purification steps. After Triton X-100 extraction and gelatin-Sepharose 4B purification of rat brain tissue extracts, two major activities were observed on gelatin zymograms. These were identified as gelatinase A and B using co-migration with astrocyte-derived enzymes and inhibition of activity by tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). The non-ionic detergents, Triton X-100 and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate (CHAPS) were equally effective in extracting activities from brain tissue. Little difference in recovery was observed among 0.1, 1 and 10% concentrations of Triton X-100. The method developed here was capable of recovering gelatinase activities from rat brain tissue over a 4-10-fold range using gelatin zymography for the measurement of activity. It is possible that this method may be modified for the measurement of gelatinases in tissues such as biopsy samples of gliomas or astrocytomas or other cancers where gelatinases are thought to play a role in tumor invasion and/or metastasis.",

Endothelins 1 and 3 increased transiently intracellular Ca(2+)concentration, endothelin 3 being less potent inducer. Dibutyryl-cAMP treated cells responded with less sensitivity. While BQ123, a specific endothelin A receptor antagonist, inhibited both endothelins induced response in proliferating cells, it failed to inhibit in dibutyryl-cAMP treated ones. IRL1620, a specific endothelin B receptor agonist, was devoid of any significant effect.

We have isolated a 2.2-kb cathepsin B genomic fragment that contains the 5'-flanking region of the cathepsin B gene. Using reporter gene analysis in human glioblastoma U87MG cells, we have mapped a 228-bp fragment (-172 to +56) having high promoter activity. This promoter region has a high G+C content; contains potential Spl, Ets, and USF binding motifs; and lacks canonical TATA and CAAT boxes immediately upstream of the major transcriptional initiation site. Cotransfection experiments demonstrated that Spl and Ets1 could trans-activate cathepsin B transcription, whereas Ets2 could not. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and supershift assays revealed that three of the four putative Sp1 sites in this promoter region form a specific complex containing the Sp1 transcription factor. Mutating all four of the Spl binding sites individually markedly reduced the promoter activity of transfected reporter genes in U87 cells. Cotransfection of this cathepsin B promoter construct with Spl family expression vectors in Schneider's Drosophila line 2 (SL2) cells demonstrated that Spl and Sp3, but not Sp4, activated cathepsin B transcription. Taken together, these results suggest that Sp1, Sp3, and Ets1 are important factors in cathepsin B transcription. The regulation of cathepsin B transcription by Sp1- and Sp1-related factors is mediated through multiple GC boxes.",

The overexpression and knockdown of ETBR was conducted in Hs683 human oligodendroglioma cells, and cell proliferation and activation (phosphorylation) of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were measured in vitro. An orthotopic xenograft oligodendroglioma mouse model was established. Mouse survival times and immunohistochemical Ki67 staining in the xenografts were examined. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the overexpression of ETBR significantly enhanced the proliferation of oligodendroglioma cells and the activation of ERK compared with the controls, which was eliminated by the selective ETBR inhibitor BQ788 and ERK-specific inhibitor U0126, but not selective endothelin A receptor inhibitor BQ123. By contrast, the knockdown of endogenous ETBR markedly decreased oligodendroglioma cell proliferation and the activation of ERK compared with the controls. Overexpression of ETBR significantly increased immunohistochemical Ki67 staining in the Hs683 cell orthotopic xenograft and decreased animal survival. By contrast, knockdown of ETBR significantly decreased Ki67 staining and increased mouse survival times. Intratumoral injection of BQ788, but not BQ123, significantly decreased Ki67 staining and prolonged mouse survival times. In conclusion, ETBR was demonstrated to mediate the proliferation of oligodendroglioma cells according to an ERK-dependent mechanism. Using an orthotopic xenograft oligodendroglioma mouse model, it was demonstrated in vivo that ETBR promotes oligodendroglioma proliferation and that the selective ETBR antagonist effectively inhibits the proliferation of oligodendroglioma cells and prolongs survival times. This study provides a novel insight into the role of ETBR in oligodendroglioma proliferation and survival, and provides the first in vivo evidence that ETBR-specific antagonists are a potential therapeutic alternative for oligodendrogliomas.

We now report that numerous human tumor-derived cell lines simultaneously express the genes for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A and B chains and the PDGF receptor (PDGF-R). Measurement of mRNA transcribed from these genes showed that among 16 malignant glioma cell lines tested, 15 expressed the PDGF A gene, 12 expressed the PDGF B gene, and 13 expressed the PDGF-R gene. Of three osteosarcoma lines, three expressed PDGF A, two expressed PDGF B, and three expressed PDGF-R. For eight malignant melanoma lines, seven expressed PDGF A, five expressed PDGF B, and three expressed PDGF-R genes. Thus, 13 of 16 malignant glioma, 3 of 3 osteosarcomas, and 3 of 8 malignant melanoma cell lines expressed the PDGF receptor gene and either or both PDGF genes. Five cell lines were tested for production of biologically active PDGF and PDGF receptor protein. Media conditioned by each of the five cell lines induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein identical in size to the PDGF receptor. These five cell lines also produced PDGF receptor protein as measured by Western blot analysis or metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation using PDGF-R antibodies. The PDGF receptors of these cell lines were activated by human platelet PDGF or by recombinant AA or BB homodimers.

Accord-ingly, in the new Sainte-Anne grading system of oligodendrogliomas, endothelial hyperplasia and contrast enhancement, both being indicators of microangiogenesis, are key criteria for the distinction of grade A from grade B tumours. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenic factor: a strong correlation between VEGF expression, Sainte-Anne malignancy grade and patient outcome might thus be expected. In order to assess this hypothesis, VEGF immunostaining was performed in a series of 34 oligodendrogliomas that included 11 grade B and 23 grade A, of which nine became grade B during the study period (mean clinical and imaging follow-up: 41 months). VEGF expression correlated strongly with Sainte-Anne tumour grade (P < 0.001), and inversely with patient survival (P < 0.001) and recurrence-free survival (P = 0.002). One hundred per cent of grade B but only 17% of grade A were VEGF-positive. By contrast, the MIB-1 labelling index did not correlate with VEGF expression, total survival or recurrence-free survival. In accordance with the grading system, this study showed that, in oligodendrogliomas, VEGF expression and microangiogenesis are progression-related phenomena that confer on these tumours a growth advantage by presumably reducing hypoxia-induced apoptotic cell death. These findings might have important implications in the future for the indication and timing of anti-angiogenic therapies.",

The tumors were induced by stereotactic implantation of 1000 glioma cells into the right caudate nucleus of 26 adult CDF-rats and examined after 10, 14, 18, and 21 days following controlled intracardial perfusion of the host animals. Our histochemical results on paraffin sections demonstrate that B-RCA I selectively stains vascular endothelial cells of arteries, veins, and capillaries not only in the normal rat brain but also in the transplantation tumors. Subsequently morphometric measurements of the B-RCA I-stained sections were performed to define the tumor vascularization in quantitative terms. There was an increase in the mean tumor vessel diameters during tumor growth in both transplantation tumor types leading to values about two times above those of the normal rat striatum. On the contrary, the mean vessel density and the mean vessel surface per tumor area were markedly reduced in the late stages of both tumor types when compared to the normal striatum. The RG2 and F98 transplantation tumors differed with regard to the intercapillary distance, which was two times higher in the F98 transplantation tumors than in the RG2 tumors on day 21. In conclusion, B-RCA I is a very sensitive histochemical marker for rat vascular endothelia on paraffin sections.

Despite multidisciplinary approaches, the median survival time for patients with glioblastoma multiform (GBM) remains at less than 1 year from initial diagnosis. Temozolomide (TMZ), an oral alkylating agent, has shown promising activity in the treatment of malignant gliomas. We conducted a multicenter randomized phase II study comparing the efficacy and safety of TMZ administered concomitantly and sequentially to RT versus RT alone in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.;One hundred thirty patients with pathologically confirmed, newly diagnosed GBM were randomly assigned (110 assessable patients) to receive either TMZ 75 mg/m(2)/d orally, concomitantly with RT (60 Gy in 30 fractions; group A, n = 57), followed by six cycles of TMZ (150 mg/m(2) on days 1 through 5 and 15 to 19 every 28 days), or RT alone (60 Gy in 30 fractions; group B, n = 53).;Median time to progression was 10.8 months in group A and 5.2 months in group B (P = .0001). One-year progression-free survival rate was 36.6% in group A and 7.7% in group B. Median overall survival (OS) time was also significantly better in group A versus group B (13.4 v 7.7 months, respectively; P < .0001), as was the 1-year OS at 56.3% v 15.7% (P < .0001), respectively. Toxicity was mainly hematologic. One patient with grade 4 myelotoxicity died as a result of sepsis.

The purpose of this study was (a) to identify if astrocytes show a similar non-Nernstian depolarization in low K+ or low Ca2+ solutions as previously found in human glial and glioma cells, and (b) to analyze the influence of the K+ conductance on the membrane potential of astrocytes. 2. The membrane potential (Em) and the ionic conductance were studied with whole-cell patch-clamp technique in neonatal rat astrocytes (5-9 days in culture) and in human glioma cells (U-251MG). 3. In 3.0 mM K+ Em was -75 +/- 1.0 mV (mean +/- SEM, n = 39) in rat astrocytes and -79 +/- 0.7 mV (n = 5) in U-251MG cells. In both cell types Em changed linearly to the logarithm of [K+]0 between 3.0 and 160 mM K+ free medium caused astrocytes to hyperpolarize to -93 +/- 2.7 mV (n = 21) and U-251MG cells to depolarize to -27 +/- 2.1 mV (n = 3). 4. The I-E curve did not show inward rectification in astrocytes at this developmental stage. The slope conductance (g) exhibited only a small decrease (-19%) in K+ free solution and no significant change in 160 mM K+. 5. Ba2+ (1.0 mM) depolarized astrocytes to -45 +/- 2.9 mV (n = 11), decreasing the slope conductance (g) by 42.4 +/- 8.3% (n = 11). Ca2+ free solution depolarized astrocytes to -53 +/- 3.4 mV (n = 12) and resulted in a positive shift of the I-E curve, increasing g by 15.3 +/- 8.2% (n = 8). 6. Calculations indicated that a block of K+ channels explains the depolarizing effect of Ba2+. The effects of K+ free or Ca2+ free solutions on Em can be explained by a transformation of K+ channels to non-specific leakage channels. That astrocytes show a different reaction to low K+ than glioma cells can be related to the lack of inwardly rectifying K+ channels in astrocytes at this developmental stage.",

In many in vitro studies TIL have been shown to manifest anti-tumour reactivity, yet many tumours escape immunological destruction. To investigate the role of Fas expression and the concomitant sensitivity to the inducibility of apoptotic death, we derived TIL from four melanomas and one glioma. The glioma, and all but one of the melanomas, expressed Fas, but Fas-mediated apoptosis could only be detected if the targets were treated with cyclohexamide. The melanomas and the glioma all expressed detectable cytoplasmic Bcl-2 protein, known to exert anti-apoptotic activity. Lysis of tumours by CD8-enriched cultures and CD8+ clones was Ca2+-dependent and could not be modified by an anti-Fas MoAb. In CD4-enriched cultures or CD4+ clones with cytotoxic potential against tumour cells, cytotoxicity was also Ca2+-dependent. As Ca2+-dependent cytotoxicity is usually the result of secretion of perforin/granzyme-B, we investigated the presence of perforin in cytotoxic CD4+ clones and demonstrated the presence of granular deposits of this enzyme in some of the CD4+ clones. Although an anti-Fas MoAb did not block the lysis of melanoma targets by CD4+ clones, the examination of Fas-dependent targets demonstrated that these clones also had the potential to kill by the Fas/Fas ligand system. These data suggest that the predominant mechanism in tumour killing by TIL appears to be perforin-granzyme-dependent, and that the solid tumour cell lines we studied are less susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis. As non-apoptotic pathways may enhance tumour immunogenicity, exploitation of the perforin-granzyme-dependent cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) pathways may be important for achieving successful anti-tumour responses.",

Our results indicate that one of these lesions is represented by the down-regulation of the oncosuppressor Btg2. By in vivo transplantation assays, we further demonstrate that fully progressed tumors are PDGF-B-addicted because their tumor-propagating ability is lost when the PDGF-B transgene is silenced, whereas it is promptly reacquired after its reactivation. We provide evidence that this oncogene addiction is not caused by the need for PDGF-B as a mitogen but, rather, to the fact that PDGF-B is required to overcome cell-cell contact inhibition and to confer in vivo infiltrating potential on tumor cells.",

A spectral-domain tomograph using 840 nm and 930 nm superluminescence diodes (SLD) with a central wavelength of 900 nm was used as a second imaging modelity.;Both time-domain and spectral-domain coherence tomography delineated normal brain, the infiltration zone and solid tumor in murine intracerebral gliomas. Histological evaluation of H&E sections parallel to the optical plain demonstrated that tumor areas of less than a millimeter could be detected and that not only solid tumor, but also brain invaded by a low-density single tumor cells produced an OCT signal different from normal brain. Spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) demonstrated a significantly more detailed microstructure of tumor and normal brain up to a tissue depth of 1.5-2.0 mm, whereas the interpretation of time-domain OCT (TD-OCT) was difficult at a tissue depth >1.0 mm. Because of rapid scanning times SD-OCT data could be acquired as 3D data maps, which allowed a multi-planar analysis of the tumor to brain interface. Similar to our findings in experimental gliomas, images of human nervous system tissue acquired using SD-OCT showed a characteristic signal of normal brain tissue and a detailed microstructure of tumor parenchyma.;Spectral-domain OCT of experimental gliomas and human brain tumor specimens differentiates solid tumor, diffusely invaded brain tissue, and adjacent normal brain based on microstructure and B-scan signal characteristics. In conjunction with the rapid image acquisition rates of SD-OCT, this technology carries the potential of a novel intraoperative imaging tool for the detection of residual tumor and guidance of neurosurgical tumor resections.",

In this study, we screened for the essential components of a PDGF autocrine loop in fresh surgical isolates of human astrocytomas, using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical techniques. Eight malignant astrocytomas (6 glioblastomas and 2 anaplastic astrocytomas), 5 low-grade astrocytomas and 4 non-neoplastic glial specimens (mesial temporal sclerosis) were evaluated. Malignant astrocytomas, and to a lesser extent low-grade astrocytomas, expressed more PDGF-A and PDGF-B than non-neoplastic glia. PDGF-alpha-receptor expression was elevated both in malignant and in low-grade astrocytomas. These data support the argument that PDGF autocrine loops contribute to the unregulated growth of human astrocytomas. Expression of PDGF and PDGF receptor in low-grade astrocytomas suggests that activation of PDGF autocrine loops may be an early event in the pathogenesis of malignant astrocytomas.",

In addition, we determined the level and cellular source of gelatinolytic activity and localized gelatinase B and TIMP-1 RNA. Distinct expression patterns of the MMP and TIMP genes were found in the various brain tumors tested. While the WHO grade I and II tumors had MT1/MT3 ratios below 1, the malignant (grade III and IV) tumors had ratios above 1. Strong expression of TIMP-1 RNA was observed in all malignant tumors and in grade I pilocytic astrocytomas and localized to the walls of neovessels. Quantitative analysis of enzymatic activity in the soluble fraction of protein extracts revealed that in most tumors gelatinases remained in the inactive pro-form. In situ zymography revealed net gelatinolytic activity in neurons of normal brain and in tumor cells and vessel walls of all tumors tested. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that gelatinase B was localized to vessel walls, to neutrophils in areas of hemorrhage, and in glioblastomas to macrophages. Together these data demonstrate that the different primary brain tumors show distinct regulation of MMP and TIMP genes. The localization of the soluble gelatinase B indicates an association with neovascularization, whereas membrane-bound MMPs may account for the invasive potential of the glial tumor cells.",

In this study we compared the surgical results of our earlier cases using conventional methods with more recent cases using these new methods. We report our experience based on 44 adult cases. Histologic diagnosis revealed ependymoma (20 cases), astrocytoma (15 cases), glioblastoma multiforme (1 case), and other histologic diagnoses (8 cases). We performed 20 gross total resections, 19 partial resections, and 5 biopsies. The mean follow-up period was 25.8 months (3 months-10 years). Surgical results were improvement in 11 patients (25%), stabilization in 24 (54%), and deterioration in 9 (20%). The first 28 cases (group A) were diagnosed using conventional myelography and CT myelography. The more recent 16 cases (group B) were diagnosed with MRI and operated on using techniques such as ultrasonic aspiration, intraoperative monitoring and ultrasound imaging. Radical surgery (total excision) was performed in 36% (n = 10) of group A, while it was possible in 62% (n = 10) of group B. Deterioration after operation was noted in 28% (n = 8) of group A, but only 6.2% (n = 1) of group B. These results stress the importance of a preoperative MRI scan and the positive effects of intraoperative ultrasound imaging, ultrasonic aspiration, and evoked potential monitoring on surgical results. With the help of these tools, most intramedullary spinal cord tumors may be diagnosed and treated surgically with significantly decreased risk. Radical surgery was possible in as many as 62% of our more recent patients. Partial resection with radiotherapy should be confined to patients with high-grade astrocytomas.",

This leads to clonal expansion and acquisition both of effector functions and a specific adhesion molecule pattern. Whether this program can be reshaped during the effector phase to adapt to the effector site microenvironment is unknown. We investigated this in murine brain tumor models using adoptive transfer of tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells, and in spontaneous immune responses of patients with malignant glioma. Our data show proliferation of Ag-experienced tumor-specific T cells within the brain parenchyma. Moreover, CD8(+) T cells further differentiated in the brain, exhibiting enhanced IFN-gamma and granzyme B expression and induction of alpha(E)(CD103)beta(7) integrin. This unexpected integrin expression identified a subpopulation of CD8(+) T cells conditioned by the brain microenvironment and also had functional consequences: alpha(E)(CD103)beta(7)-expressing CD8(+) T cells had enhanced retention in the brain. These findings were further investigated for CD8(+) T cells infiltrating human malignant glioma; CD8(+) T cells expressed alpha(E)(CD103)beta(7) integrin and granzyme B as in the murine models. Overall, our data indicate that the effector site plays an active role in shaping the effector phase of tumor immunity.

All four cell lines demonstrated significant reactivity with anti-neuroectodermal-associated MAb.

Review of the complete antibody reactivity profile revealed a dichotomy between lines TE-671 and Daoy and lines D283 Med and D341 Med, which have been previously shown to express neurofilament protein in culture and xenografts, and to exhibit neuroblastic morphological features in biopsy and xenograft tissue sections.

Release of prostaglandin E2 produced by angiotensin II from rat C6 glioma, human astrocytoma, or porcine aortic smooth muscle cells in culture was blocked by the addition of the 10(-7) M of DuP 753. In contrast, the release of prostacyclin, as assessed by measurement of the stable metabolite 6-keto PGF1 alpha, was not attenuated by addition of Du P 753. However, DuP 753 either alone or in combination with angiotensin II, produced dose-dependent increases in prostacyclin release with doses as low as 10(-8) M. In the absence of angiotensin II, DuP 753 also increased prostaglandin E2 release at high doses but the magnitude of the potentiation was substantially less than for prostacyclin release (50 to 250% v 400 to 2800% above basal). Thus, we clearly show that angiotensin II stimulates PGE2 release via subtype 1 (or B) angiotensin receptors. Whether the effect of DuP 753 on prostaglandin release is a result of agonistic properties or intrinsic effects unrelated to blockage of angiotensin II receptors remains to be determined. The marked stimulatory effect of DuP 753 release precludes characterization of the receptor subtype that mediates the Ang II-induced release of prostacyclin. Nonetheless, potent stimulation of prostacyclin release by DuP 753, especially in vascular smooth muscle cells, requires reevaluation of the mechanisms that participate in the anti-hypertensive effects of the compound.",

In this context, low density lipoproteins (LDL) play a key role in the delivery of the photosensitizer in tumor cells. We correlate the physicochemical parameters of the berberine association to LDL with the influence of LDL-delivery on its accumulation in a glioma cell line and on its photo-induced activity in view of antitumor PDT. Our results evidence an important binding of 400 berberine molecules per LDL. Changes in berberine and apoprotein fluorescence suggest different fixation types, involving various LDL compartments including the vicinity of the apoprotein. The berberine association to LDL does not affect their recognition by the specific B/E receptors, of which over-expression increases the cellular uptake of LDL-preloaded berberine. Fluorescence microscopy evidences the mitochondrial labeling of the glioma model cells, with no significant modification upon LDL-delivery. Moreover, the cellular delivery of berberine by LDL increases its photocytotoxic effects on such cells. So, this research illustrates the potential of berberine as a photosensitizing agent for PDT, in particular due to their behavior towards LDL as plasma vehicles, and gives insights into its mechanisms of cell uptake.

Deregulated signaling through this pathway contributes to development of gliomas and their resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Targeting the PI3K signaling pathway has thus emerged as a promising approach to successful treatment of gliomas. We assessed the radiosensitizing potential of four small-molecule inhibitors that differ in their activities against specific isoforms of the PI3K 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). p110alpha inhibitors blocked phosphorylation of both protein kinase B/Akt and S6 in all cell lines examined, effectively decreased cellular proliferation, and produced additive cytotoxic effects in combination with radiation therapy. The p110beta inhibitor exhibited limited biochemical effects and failed to decrease cellular proliferation or viability as either a single agent or in combination with radiation or rapamycin. In vivo studies examining the effects of the p110alpha inhibitor in combination with radiation indicated a significant reduction in tumor growth rate induced by the combined treatment compared with each treatment modality alone. This translated into a trend toward prolonged time-to-failure for mice in the combination treatment group. In conclusion, PI3K inhibitors are promising agents in the treatment of glioblastomas, especially when used in combination with ionizing radiation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The cure rate for childhood intracranial ependymoma is approximately 70% in the setting of a gross total resection followed by radiation, but management remains challenging in patients with residual disease. Therefore, robust biomarkers are needed to guide the development of new targeted therapy. The authors evaluated the expression of several biomarkers in pediatric intracranial ependymoma and observed that the expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a polycomb complex protein involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression, was independently associated with poor survival.;Tissue microarray immunostaining was performed on 180 ependymoma samples from 12 of 16 Canadian pediatric centers. Expression levels of EZH2, Ki-67, B lymphoma Moloney-murine leukemia virus insertion region 1 homolog, tumor protein 16 (P16), Y-box binding protein 1, phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT), and epidermal growth factor receptor were evaluated. Cox regression analyses were performed, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to construct survival curves.;EZH2 expressed in 16% of tumors was associated with inferior 5-year overall survival. Ki-67 and pAKT levels were associated with a poor outcome in patients with posterior fossa ependymoma, and the absence of P16 was associated with a poor outcome in patients with supratentorial ependymoma. Multivariate analysis revealed that younger age and EZH2 expression (95% confidence interval, 1.1-36.0) were independent markers of a poor prognosis.;EZH2 is a novel, independent marker of a poor prognosis in patients with ependymoma, especially in those who have tumors located in the posterior fossa. EZH2, pAKT, and P16 are potential therapeutic targets, particularly for patients who have tumors in which standard gross total resection plus fractionated radiotherapy is not feasible.",

EGF levels were measured by specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) and further analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) followed by RIA and radioreceptor binding. The levels of EGF-like immunoreactivity (EGF-LI) in astrocytoma-IV tumors were fourfold greater than those in normal brain tissues. In astrocytoma-II and astrocytoma-III tumors, however, levels of EGF-LI were not different from those in normal brain. HPLC analysis of extracts from normal brain tissue and astrocytoma-II showed one peak of EGF-LI that coeluted with standard human EGF (retention time 22 min). Interestingly, EGF-LI in extracts of astrocytoma-IV tumors eluted in two distinct peaks with retention times of 24 and 26 min (Astro-A and Astro-B, respectively). Materials in both Astro-A and Astro-B peaks reduced the specific binding of [125I]hEGF to EGF receptors in human placental membranes. These studies demonstrate elevated levels of EGF-LI in malignant astrocytoma, but not in benign tumors. Furthermore, two different EGF-like molecules that are different from native EGF are present in malignant astrocytoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a crucial role in angiogenesis and progression of malignant brain tumors. Given the significance of tumor microenvironment in general, and the established role of paracrine VEGF signaling in glioblastoma (GBM) biology in particular, we explored the potential autocrine control of human astrocytoma behavior by VEGF. Using a range of cell and molecular biology approaches to study a panel of astrocytoma (grade III and IV/GBM)-derived cell lines and a series of clinical specimens from low- and high-grade astrocytomas, we show that co-expression of VEGF and VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) occurs commonly in astrocytoma cells. We found VEGF secretion and VEGF-induced biological effects (modulation of cell cycle progression and enhanced viability of glioblastoma cells) to function in an autocrine manner. Morevover, we demonstrated that the autocrine VEGF signaling is mediated via VEGFR2 (KDR), and involves co-activation of the c-Raf/MAPK, PI3K/Akt and PLC/PKC pathways. Blockade of VEGFR2 by the selective inhibitor (SU1498) abrogated the VEGF-mediated enhancement of astrocytoma cell growth and viability under unperturbed culture conditions. In addition, such interference with VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling potentiated the ionizing radiation-induced tumor cell death. In clinical specimens, both VEGFRs and VEGF were co-expressed in astroglial tumor cells, and higher VEGF expression correlated with tumor progression, thereby supporting the relevance of functional VEGF-VEGFR signaling in vivo. Overall, our results are consistent with a potential autocrine role of the VEGF-VEGFR2 (KDR) interplay as a factor contributing to malignant astrocytoma growth and radioresistance, thereby supporting the candidacy of this signaling cascade as a therapeutic target, possibly in combination with radiotherapy.",

In phase A, pGL1-TNF-alpha expression within tumors was dose dependent and transient, with highest levels seen at 18 h after injection, whereas no TNF-alpha protein was detected in plasma. Low erythrocyte counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were associated with tumor presence, but the reduction in these variables was most striking in the group receiving 450 microg of pGL1-TNF-alpha, the group that also exhibited thrombocytopenia at 72 h. In phase B, treatment with pGL1-TNF-alpha at 15 or 150 microg resulted in the greatest degree of splenomegaly, increased spontaneous blastogenesis by splenocytes, and high leukocyte and lymphocyte numbers in the spleen. In these same two groups, flow cytometry analyses of spleen cells showed that high levels of natural killer (panNK+) cells, B (CD19+) lymphocytes, and cells expressing the CD71 and CD25 activation markers were present (p < 0.05). An enhancing effect was also noted in some of the measurements with parental plasmid p WS4 and tumor presence. In phase C, the slowest tumor progression was observed in the groups receiving 15 and 150 microg pGL1-TNF-alpha together with radiation; tumor volumes were 51 and 43% smaller, respectively, than for PBS-injected controls by the end of the study. Collectively, these results show that localized treatment with pGL1-TNF-alpha is hematologically nontoxic at low doses and support the premise that activation of lymphocytes may contribute to the antitumor effects of radiation against a highly aggressive brain tumor.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cyclic AMP-dependent induction of differentiation by activation of the beta-adrenergic receptor is correlated with inhibition of protein kinase B activity concomitant with growth arrest and increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) synthesis in rat C6 glioma cells. Costimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor with purinergic receptors activated by 2-methylthio-adenosine-5'-diphosphate (2MeSADP) increased protein kinase B (PKB) phosphorylation above the level measured in non-stimulated cells and abolished cAMP-dependent differentiation. Transfection of cells with constitutively active PKB confirmed that reactivation of PKB is involved in the 2MeSADP-dependent inhibition of GFAP synthesis. The P2Y(12) and P2Y(13) receptor antagonist AR-C69931MX [N(6)-(2-methylthioethyl)-2-(3,3,3-trifluoropropylthio)-beta,gamma-dichloro-methylene ATP] decreased PKB phosphorylation to the level in non-stimulated cells, whereas the P2Y(13) antagonists pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (PPADS) and P(1),P(3)-di(adenosine-5') tetraphosphate (Ap(4)A) did not alter the 2MeSADP-induced phosphorylation of PKB, showing that enhanced PKB activity and subsequent phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 is due to stimulation of the P2Y(12) receptor. In addition, experiments in the presence of pertussis toxin and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) activity assays demonstrated that the P2Y(12) receptor-mediated increase in PKB phosphorylation is G(i) protein- and PI 3-K-dependent. The presented data demonstrated that a cAMP-dependent inhibition of PKB induces differentiation of C6 glioma cells and that inhibition of adenylate cyclase and reactivation of the PI 3-K/PKB pathway by the P2Y(12) receptor reverses differentiation into enhanced proliferation.",

From these results, we have made a presumption that for the majority drugs studied, the perturbation of cell cycle travers will be proportional to tumor cell kill. Primary cultured cells from the human brain tumor were used to determine the effectiveness of drugs for its treatment using Factor B (the accumulated cells in SG2M phases after anti-cancer drug treatment as the percentage of cells that was previously in SG2M phases) in comparison with the results (dose-response curves) obtained by glioma cell line. The clinical application was tried using these results. A case with malignant astrocytoma had shown 20.8% for ACNU treatment, however, 85.7% for VCR treatment in maximum range of Factor B on the samples of the removed tumor at the operation (cultured cells). This patient was already treated with radiation, ACNU and other anti-cancer drugs but subsequently failed and revealed constant growth in tumor size. Thereafter patient was treated with VCR according to flow cytometric indication, there was a response, that was the first time after the desperate trials of various drugs.

Rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) express high levels of Fas in vitro but are resistant to FasL (CD95L/APO-1L/CD178)-induced apoptosis. We here show that this resistance was mediated by a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)-Akt/protein kinase B (PKB)-dependent expression of lifeguard (LFG)/neuronal membrane protein 35. Reduction of endogenous LFG expression by antisense oligonucleotides or small interfering RNA lead to increased sensitivity of CGNs to FasL-induced cell death and caspase-8 cleavage. The inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity sensitized CGNs to FasL-induced caspase-8 and caspase-3 processing and caspase-dependent fodrin cleavage. Pharmacological inhibition of PI 3-kinase, overexpression of the inhibitory protein IkappaB, or cotransfection of an LFG reporter plasmid with dominant-negative Akt/PKB inhibited LFG reporter activity, whereas overexpression of constitutively active Akt/PKB increased LFG reporter activity. Overexpression of LFG in CGNs interfered with the sensitization to FasL by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. In contrast to CGNs, 12 glioma cell lines, which are sensitive to FasL, did not express LFG. Gene transfer of LFG into these FasL-susceptible glioma cells protected against FasL-induced apoptosis. These results demonstrate that LFG mediated the FasL resistance of CGNs and that, under certain circumstances, e.g., inhibition of the PI 3-kinase-Akt/PKB pathway, CGNs were sensitized to FasL.",

Surgery represents the standard therapy, with the goal of obtaining complete resection even at the risk of neurological morbidity. MRI is the gold standard for diagnosis and assessment of intramedullary tumors. Nevertheless, sometimes MRI may not accurately differentiate between different types of intramedullary tumors, in particular if they are associated with syringes or intra- and peritumoral cysts. This could subsequently affect surgical strategies. Intraoperative ultrasound (ioUS) has become in the last few years a very useful tool for use during neurosurgical procedures. Various ioUS modalities such as B-mode and Doppler have been applied during neurosurgical procedures. On the other hand, the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is not yet well defined and standardized in this field. We report a case of a young patient harboring a cervicothoracic intramedullary tumor, for which the preoperative neuroradiologi-cal diagnosis was in favor of a diffuse astrocytoma with nodular components whereas ioUS demonstrated 3 distinct intramedullary nodules. CEUS showed highly vascularized lesions, compatible with hemangioblastomas. These findings, particularly those obtained with CEUS, allowed better definition of the lesions for diagnosis, enhanced understanding of the physiopathological aspects, and permitted the localization of all 3 nodules, thus limiting spinal cord manipulation and allowing complete resection of the lesions, with an uneventful postoperative neurological course. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of intraoperative CEUS in a case of intramedullary hemangioblastoma. ",

The nucleoskeletal protein lamin-A varies both within and between cell types and was shown here to contribute to cell sorting and survival in migration through constraining micropores. Lamin-A proved rate-limiting in 3D migration of diverse human cells that ranged from glioma and adenocarcinoma lines to primary mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Stoichiometry of A- to B-type lamins established an activation barrier, with high lamin-A:B producing extruded nuclear shapes after migration. Because the juxtaposed A and B polymer assemblies respectively conferred viscous and elastic stiffness to the nucleus, subpopulations with different A:B levels sorted in 3D migration. However, net migration was also biphasic in lamin-A, as wild-type lamin-A levels protected against stress-induced death, whereas deep knockdown caused broad defects in stress resistance. In vivo xenografts proved consistent with A:B-based cell sorting, and intermediate A:B-enhanced tumor growth. Lamins thus impede 3D migration but also promote survival against migration-induced stresses. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"To fully develop its potential boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) requires the combination of a suitable thermal/epithermal neutron flux together with a selective intake of (10)B-boron nuclei in the target tissue. The latter condition is the most critical to be realized as none of the boron carriers used for experimental or clinical purposes proved at the moment an optimal selectivity for cancer cells compared to normal cells. In addition to complex physical factors, the assessment of the intracellular concentration of boron represent a crucial parameter to predict the dose delivered to the cancer cells during the treatment. Nowadays the dosimetry calculation and then the prediction of the treatment effectiveness are made using Monte Carlo simulations, but some of the model assumption are still uncertain: the radiobiological dose efficacy and the probability of tumour cell survival are crucial parameters that needs a more reliable experimental approach. The aim of this work was to evaluate the differential ability of two cell lines to selectively concentrate the boron-10 administered as di-hydroxyboryl-phenylalanine (BPA)-fructose adduct, and the effect of the differential boron intake on the damage produced by the irradiation with thermal neutrons; the two cell lines were selected to be representative one of normal tissues involved in the active/passive transport of boron carriers, and one of the tumour. Recent in vitro studies demonstrated how BPA is taken by proliferating cells, however the mechanism of BPA uptake and the parameters driving the kinetics of influx and the elimination of BPA are still not clarified. In these preliminary studies we analysed the survival of F98 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cells line after irradiation, using different thermal fluencies at the same level of density population and boron concentration in the growing medium prior the irradiation. This is first study performed on endothelium model obtained by a primary human cell line (HUVEC). The perspective application of this work is to develop a model able to foresee the effects produced by different combination of boron influx with a thermal neutron fluencies, applying a standardized radiobiological methodology, and in particular to continue the investigation of the radiobiological effects on the endothelium model as the main tissue involved in the transport of boronated molecules.",

        "Doc_abstract":"As concerns human adult brain neoplasms, the biological behaviour of glioblastoma, a high-grade neuro-ectodermal tumour, is among the most disadvantageous. Glioblastoma may develop either as a primary tumour without clinical and histological evidence of a prior precursor lesion, or as the final stage of malignant transformation of a low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma. There are conflicting reports in connection with the association of the p53 tumour suppressor gene mutation with the clinical and histological progression of gliomas. Previous studies likewise led to contradictory results concerning the significance of ras oncogenes in different histological malignancies, and especially in neuro-epithelial tumours. The possible roles of p53 and ras gene alterations in the development of \"primary\" and \"transformed\" glioblastomas were studied in this work. Eighteen tumours were investigated by means of immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction-assisted-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) sequence analysis in a search for molecular genetic differences between primary and transformed glioblastomas. An increased incidence of p53-immunopositive cells was observed in both types of glioblastomas but there was no significant difference between the transformed tumours and the primary form. All samples were screened for point mutation in codons 12 and 61 of the H-, K-, and N-ras oncogenes and exons 5-8 of the p53 gene. No aberrant band or mutation was found in the H-, K- and N-ras oncogenes. Aberrant bands were seen in only 2 (11%) of the 18 tumours in the SSCP analyses of exons 6 and 8. Sequence analysis of the 2 abnormal cases revealed G --> C transmission in the second nucleotide of codon 280 on exon 8, which resulted in a change in the encoded amino acid from arginine to threonine (case 15). A ttagtct --> ttggtct transmission on intron 5 (case 8) was also found. No genetic difference could be identified between the primary and the transformed glioblastoma forms as concerns their p53 and ras oncogenes. There are two possible explanations for these findings: (a) The p53 and ras gene mutations were not primary events in the morphological transformations. Alterations in these genes may therefore take place at an early stage in glioma progression. (b) The different genetic changes may accumulate during glioblastoma development. These specific genetic events may additionally play a role in multistep tumourigenesis.",

For BNCT experiments, which were initiated 14 days after intracerebral implantation of 1000 F98 cells, BSH (30 mg B/kg b.wt. was administered intravenously (i.v.) without BBB-D, or i.c. with or without BBB-D. The animals were irradiated 2.5 h later with a collimated beam of thermal neutrons at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Medical Research Reactor.;The mean tumor boron concentration after i.c. injection with BBB-D was 48.6 +/- 17.2 microg/g at 2.5 h compared with 30.8 +/- 12.2 microg/g after i.c. injection without BBB-D and 12.9 +/- 4.2 microg/g after i.v. injection. The best composite tumor to normal tissue ratios were observed at 2.5 h after BBB-D, at which time the tumor:blood (T:B1) ratio was 5.0, and the tumor: brain (T:Br) ratio was 12.3, compared to 1.1 and 4.6, respectively, in i.v. injected rats. The mean survival time for untreated control rats was 24 +/- 3 days, 29 +/- 4 days for irradiated controls, 33 +/- 6 days for those receiving i.v. injection of BSH, 40 +/- 8 days for rats receiving i.c.

It is associated with increased motility and a potential to hydrolyse macromolecular components of the extracellular matrix. The peptidases that have been most investigated, and are induced during this process, are reviewed: the plasminogen activators (PAs), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and lysosomal cysteine peptidases called cathepsins (Cats). Increased levels of urokinase-type PA (uPA) are observed mainly at the invasive margins of a tumour, whereas the data on the expression of tissue-type PA (tPA) are still controversial. It has been shown that the endogenous inhibitor of PAs, PAI-1, is localised in both tumour and tumour-associated endothelial cells. Among MMPs, the expression of the gelatinases, MMP2 and MMP9, strongly correlates with glioma progression. Membrane bound MT-MMPs, in particular MT1- and MT2-MMP, seem to play a major role in activating MMP-2. Several members of the ADAMTS family have also been detected in brain tumours, the most relevant being ADAMTS4, due to its cleavage of CNS specific proteins. Lysosomal cathepsin B is highly expressed in malignant glial cells and in endothelial cells of vascularised glioblastomas and is a predictor of a shorter survival. In addition to invasion, cathepsin L may play a role in decreased susceptibility of anaplastic glioma cells to apoptosis. Finally, cathepsin B was proposed as a marker for malignancy in the more aggressive type of meningiomas. Each of these peptidases may act alone, or in concert with the others, to support malignant behaviour of brain tumour cells; the development of new inhibitors of invasion, therefore, should contribute to the control of local spread of a tumour.",

It has also been evaluated in several clinical trials for treatment of brain tumors such as high-grade glioma. In this study, we investigated the influence of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) on distribution of gefitinib to the central nervous system. In vitro studies conducted in Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells indicate that both P-gp and BCRP effectively transport gefitinib, limiting its intracellular accumulation. In vivo studies demonstrated that transport of gefitinib across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is significantly limited. Steady-state brain-to-plasma (B/P) concentration ratios were 70-fold higher in the Mdr1a/b(-/-) Bcrp1(-/-) mice (ratio of approximately 7) compared with wild-type mice (ratio of approximately 0.1). The B/P ratio after oral administration increased significantly when gefitinib was coadministered with the dual P-gp and BCRP inhibitor elacridar. We investigated the integrity of tight junctions in the Mdr1a/b(-/-) Bcrp1(-/-) mice and found no difference in the brain inulin and sucrose space between the wild-type and Mdr1a/b(-/-) Bcrp1(-/-) mice. This suggested that the dramatic enhancement in the brain distribution of gefitinib is not due to a leakier BBB in these mice. These results show that brain distribution of gefitinib is restricted due to active efflux by P-gp and BCRP. This finding is of clinical significance for therapy in brain tumors such as glioma, where concurrent administration of a dual inhibitor such as elacridar can increase delivery and thus enhance efficacy of gefitinib.",

The polymers were synthesized and tagged with folic acid (FA) to render them as efficient cancer cell targeting cargos. FA-conjugated block copolymers were self-assembled to a nearly spherical (ranging from 15 to 170 nm) polymeric micelle (FA-PM) with a sufficiently lower range of critical micelle concentration (0.59 × 10(-2) to 1.52 × 10(-2) mg/mL) suitable for performing as an efficient drug carrier. The blocks show lower critical solution temperature (LCST) ranging from 30 to 39 °C with high DOX-loading content (24.3%, w/w) as compared to that reported for a linear polymer in the contemporary literature. The temperature-induced reduction in size (57%) of the FA-PM enables a high rate of DOX release (78.57% after 24 h) at a temperature above LCST. The DOX release rate has also been tuned by on-demand administration of temperature. The in vitro biocompatibilities of the blank and DOX-loaded FA-PMs have been studied by the MTT assay. The cellular uptake study proves selective internalization of the FA-PM into cancerous cells (C6 glioma) compared that into normal cells (HaCaT). In vivo administration of the DOX-loaded FA-PMs into the C6 glioma rat tumor model resulted in significant accumulation in tumor sites, which drastically inhibited the tumor volume by ∼83.9% with respect to control without any significant systemic toxicity.

Saponins have been reported to have important time-dependent anti-cancer properties. We have used a highly purified and characterized saponin fraction containing the soyasapogenol B glycosides (the 'B group' saponins) from soybeans (Glycine max L.) to demonstrate a reduction in SNB 19 human glioblastoma cell invasion (45% decrease compared to untreated cells) in vitro in a Matrigel invasion assay. We have also demonstrated that triterpenoid saponin induces apopotosis and affects mictochondiral function. Dose-dependent loss of mitochondrial trans-membrane potential in SNB 19 cells occurred with treatment, along with release of cytochrome c, processing of caspase-9, and -3 and specific cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), a substrate of caspase-3. The results suggest that the saponin fraction induces apoptosis in SNB19 human glioblastoma cells by stimulating cytochrome-c release and subsequent activation of a caspase cascade. Our observations clearly demonstrate the pro-apoptotic and anti-invasive activities of the soyasapogenol B glycosides from soybeans.",

We sought to decipher this heterogeneity by integrating matched genetic alterations and candidate cells of origin to generate accurate disease models. First, we identified subgroups of human ependymoma, a form of neural tumour that arises throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Subgroup-specific alterations included amplifications and homozygous deletions of genes not yet implicated in ependymoma. To select cellular compartments most likely to give rise to subgroups of ependymoma, we matched the transcriptomes of human tumours to those of mouse neural stem cells (NSCs), isolated from different regions of the CNS at different developmental stages, with an intact or deleted Ink4a/Arf locus (that encodes Cdkn2a and b). The transcriptome of human supratentorial ependymomas with amplified EPHB2 and deleted INK4A/ARF matched only that of embryonic cerebral Ink4a/Arf(-/-) NSCs. Notably, activation of Ephb2 signalling in these, but not other, NSCs generated the first mouse model of ependymoma, which is highly penetrant and accurately models the histology and transcriptome of one subgroup of human supratentorial tumour. Further, comparative analysis of matched mouse and human tumours revealed selective deregulation in the expression and copy number of genes that control synaptogenesis, pinpointing disruption of this pathway as a critical event in the production of this ependymoma subgroup. Our data demonstrate the power of cross-species genomics to meticulously match subgroup-specific driver mutations with cellular compartments to model and interrogate cancer subgroups.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The possibility of links between psychosocial factors and cancer incidence and progression has generated considerable scientific and public interest. Tachykinins, including substance P, neurokinin A and B, hemokinin-1 and endokinins, are a family of neuropeptides, acting through three types of transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors denoted NK1, NK2 and NK3. Besides their role as neurotransmitters in peripheral and central nervous system, tachykinins and their receptors are also expressed in several non neuronal cells contributing to the fine connections between nervous systems and peripheral organ system such as respiratory, cardiovascular, immune, endocrine, gastrointestinal and genitourinary. Being so much involved in regulating physiological functions, they, of course, can concur to pathological conditions including cancer. Tachykinins can act on different steps of carcinogenesis. Tumors expressing NK receptors, such as astrocytoma, glioma, neuroblastoma, pancreatic cancer and melanoma, can misuse tachykinin-induced signaling, operating in normal cells, to promote proliferation and survival of cancer cells and to release cytokines and soluble mediators favoring tumor growth. In neuroblastoma, breast and prostate carcinomas tachykinins facilitate tumor metastatic infiltration in the bone marrow. In neuroendocrine carcinoma, tachykinins are responsible of symptoms associated with these pathologies including flushing, diarrhea, wheezing and right heart disease. In addition, regardless tumor histology, tachykinins may favor cancer incidence and metastatic progression by influencing blood flux and neovascularization in tumor formation as well as inducing immunosuppression mediated by neurogenic inflammation due to stress or surgery. However, the precise involvement of tachykinins in cancer pathologies and the potentiality to become effective pharmacological drug targets remain to be fully defined.",

Initial symptoms were caused in 10 cases by the tumour, in 8 cases by aneurysmal rupture. In 2 cases the tumour was discovered years after the exclusion of the aneurysm. The tumour was supratentorial in 14 cases, and was more commonly a meningioma (44% of cases) or glioma (38% of cases). A total of 25 aneurysms were observed in the 18 patients: 8 had ruptured and 17 were incidental. The aneurysms were more commonly on the internal carotid artery (40%). Surgical treatment was undertaken in 13 patients, and consisted of: a) tumour resection plus aneurysmal exclusion in 6 patients, b) only tumour resection in 5 patients with incidental aneurysms, and c) only exclusion of the aneurysm in 2 patients later developing malignant gliomas. Rupture of incidental aneurysms was never observed. The prognosis was linked mainly to the nature of the tumour in cases with malignant tumours, and to the evolution of subarachnoid haemorrhage in patients with ruptured aneurysms. As a whole, a satisfactory recovery was observed in 7 patients, and death occurred in 11 patients, mainly due to progressive evolution of the malignant tumour (in 6 cases) or to fatal aneurysmal rebleeding (in 3 cases). It is concluded that tumours associated with aneurysms should be operated on at the same time whenever possible, and decisions regarding exclusion of incidental aneurysms should be balanced against the risks of the procedure.",

The extent of extraction did not depend on whether the cells were in monolayer culture of in suspension or whether choleragen was found at 0 or 37 degrees C. A similar resistance to extraction was also observed in membranes isolated from toxin-treated cells. Using more drastic conditions and other non-ionic detergents, 90% of the bound choleragen was solubilized from cells and membranes. When rat glioma C6 cells, which bind only small amounts of choleragen, were incubated with the ganglioside GM1, toxin binding was increased and the bound toxin was also resistant to extraction. When these cells were incubated with [3H]GM1, up to 70% of the cell-associated GM1 was extracted under the mild conditions. When the Gm1-labeled cells were incubated with choleragen or its B (binding) component, there was a significant reduction in the solubilization of GM1. Similar results were obtained with isolated membranes. When choleragen-receptor complexes were isolated from N18 cells labeled with [3H] galactose by immunoadsorption, only labeled GM1 was specifically recovered.

In contrast, the brain is a major target for metastatic spread of many systemic tumors. Recently, it was demonstrated that expression of splice variants of CD44 (CD44v), but not standard CD44 (CD44s), was sufficient to confer metastatic potential to low- or nonmetastatic rat tumor cells. Because CD44 is expressed in brain tumors, we examined whether differential expression of CD44 isoforms was correlated with the metastatic behavior of these tumors. We compared CD44s and CD44v expression in 17 human glioblastomas, 18 glioma cell lines, and metastases of 15 other tumors to the brain by reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction, Northern blotting, and immunocytochemistry. These experiments showed that 0 of 17 glioblastomas and 0 of 18 glioma cell lines expressed CD44v as compared to 12 of 15 brain metastases. These data show a correlation between CD44v expression and the metastatic ability of the tumors analyzed (P < 0.01). This suggests (a) that the biological significance of the lack of CD44v expression in human glioblastomas warrants further examination with regard to their inability to metastasize extraneurally and (b) that CD44v expression may play a role in the intracerebral spread of about 80% [corrected] of the brain metastases. Therefore, CD44v expression should be further considered as a potential marker for differential diagnosis and prognosis of patients with brain metastases.",

Inhibition by DCA of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases and subsequent reactivation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and oxidative phosphorylation is the common mechanism accounting for the drug's anti-neoplastic effects. At least two fundamental changes in tumor metabolism are induced by DCA that antagonize tumor growth, metastases and survival: the first is the redirection of glucose metabolism from glycolysis to oxidation (reversal of the Warburg effect), leading to inhibition of proliferation and induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis. These effects have been replicated in both human cancer cell lines and in tumor implants of diverse germ line origin. The second fundamental change is the oxidative removal of lactate, via pyruvate, and the co-incident buffering of hydrogen ions by dehydrogenases located in the mitochondrial matrix. Preclinical studies demonstrate that DCA has additive or synergistic effects when used in combination with standard agents designed to modify tumor oxidative stress, vascular remodeling, DNA integrity or immunity. These findings and limited clinical results suggest that potentially fruitful areas for additional clinical trials include 1) adult and pediatric high grade astrocytomas; 2) BRAF-mutant cancers, such as melanoma, perhaps combined with other pro-oxidants; 3) tumors in which resistance to standard platinum-class drugs alone may be overcome with combination therapy; and 4) tumors of endodermal origin, in which extensive experimental research has demonstrated significant anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic effects of DCA, leading to improved host survival.

Here, we have assessed the efficacy of the microtubule inhibiting agent epothilone B on glioblastoma cell motility, a prerequisite cellular program of invasive glioblastomas. Using cell migration assays and immunofluorescence techniques we demonstrated that epothilone B abrogated glioblastoma cell motility as a consequence of α-actinin 4 redistristrubiton and the breakdown of cellular structures (leading edge, stress fibers) it is associated with during cell migration. Evaluation of the microtubule actin cross linking factor in glioblastoma cells also revealed epothilone B invoked changes in this cytoskeleton cross linking protein, resembling α-actinin 4 changes in response to epothilone B. We have demonstrated in this study that epothilone B antagonizes glioblastoma cell motility due to the disruption of cytoskeleton binding proteins that aide in preserving the structural organization of the cytoskeleton filamentous network. Furthermore, we provide preclincial evidence that epothilone B effects on glioblastomas are not limited to the impairment of dividing tumors cells but that it also targets migratory and invasive glioblastoma cells, suggesting that this agent has potential clinical benefit due to its ability to target divergent cellular programs in the glioblastoma tumor mass.",

The 9L rat brain tumor is a gliosarcoma and a model used to study treatment paradigms for human gliomas. To study the roles of fibrin and fibrinolysis in this brain tumor model, we used these features to investigate the nature of the plasminogen activator (PA) and thrombin inhibitors in normal rat brain and in the 9L rat brain tumor, growing both in vitro and in vivo in rat brain. The results indicate that cells cultured from the tumor in vitro express PA inhibitory activity which is both of the protease nexin I and PA inhibitor 1 types. However, the serpin PA inhibitory activity in extracts of both the normal brain and tumor is of the protease nexin I/PA inhibitor 3 type. This activity is higher in the tumor than in the surrounding \"normal\" tissue.

Previous studies of GSTM3 and GSTP1 polymorphisms and adult brain tumor risk have produced inconsistent results, whereas the GSTM3 -63 variant is newly identified and, therefore, has not yet been studied in this context. We therefore examined associations between GSTM3 -63, GSTM3 *A/*B, GSTP1 105, and GSTP1 114 variants and adult brain tumor risk and the interaction of the effects of these same polymorphisms with cigarette smoking. In addition, the enzymes NQO1 and CYP1A1 alter susceptibility to oxidative brain damage. Because there is less previous evidence for a role of NQO1, CYP1A1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 variants, we restricted analysis of these variants to a small preliminary study.;We genotyped DNA collected for an international population-based case-control study of 725 glioma cases, 329 of which were glioblastoma cases, 546 meningioma cases and 1,612 controls. Study participants were residents of Sweden, southeast England, Denmark, and Finland.;We found no associations between the GSTM3, GSTP1, NQO1, CYP1A1, GSTM1, or GSTT1 polymorphisms and adult brain tumor risk with the possible exception of a weak association between the G-C (Val-Ala) GSTP1 105/114 haplotype and glioma [odds ratio (OR), 0.73; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.54, 0.99], nor was there an interaction between the effects of the GSTM3 or GSTP1 polymorphisms and cigarette smoking.;Overall, we observed no strong evidence for an association between GST or related enzyme polymorphisms and adult brain tumor risk.",

Multiple tumor cell lines of varying histiotypes, including A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), 786-O (renal cell carcinoma), HeLa (cervical carcinoma), MDA-MB-231 (breast), K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia), Jurkat (acute T-cell leukemia), MEC-2 (B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia), and U251 and D37 (glioma), as well as cells derived from primary human glioma tumors that are likely a more clinically relevant model were treated with sorafenib or bortezomib alone or in combination. Sorafenib and bortezomib synergistically induced a marked increase in mitochondrial injury and apoptosis, reflected by cytochrome c release, caspase-3 cleavage, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation in a broad range of solid tumor and leukemia cell lines. These findings were accompanied by several biochemical changes, including decreased phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta, and Akt and increased phosphorylation of stress-related c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Inhibition of Akt was required for synergism, as a constitutively active Akt protected cells against apoptosis induced by the combination. Alternatively, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 could also protect cells from apoptosis induced by the combination, indicating that both inhibition of Akt and activation of JNK were required for the synergism. These findings show that sorafenib interacts synergistically with bortezomib to induce apoptosis in a broad spectrum of neoplastic cell lines and show an important role for the Akt and JNK pathways in mediating synergism. Further clinical development of this combination seems warranted.",

For each tumor, we ascertained information on patient age, sex, tumor location, oncological treatment, and survival after surgery. The analysis of the tumor volume and the extent of tumor resection (incomplete versus complete resection of the macroscopic tumor) was made retrospectively from the preoperative radiological investigations and, when available, also from postoperative radiology. We performed semiquantitative immunohistochemical evaluation of the presence of intermediate filament (nanofilament) proteins glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, nestin, and synemin in tumor cells. The intermediate filament system helps cells and tissues to cope with various types of stress, and thus, it might affect the malignant potential of grade IV astrocytoma. We propose a subclassification of astrocytomas grade IV with respect to the expression of the intermediate filament proteins glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, nestin, and synemin, namely, type A, B, and C. Our results suggest that the expression of the intermediate filament proteins glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, nestin, and synemin is coregulated in grade IV astrocytomas.

Surgery followed by standard radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide is the standard of care in patients with glioblastoma, however the prognosis remains poor with a median survival in the range of 12-15 months. Common genetic abnormalities in glioblastoma are associated with aberrant activation or suppression of cellular signal transduction pathways and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Special attention has been focused on targets such as epidermal growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and on pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol-3kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin and Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein-kinase pathways. Several signal transduction inhibitors have been examined in preclinical and clinical malignant glioma trials, including antiangiogenic agents (bevacizumab, enzastaurin), and inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (temsirolimus, everolimus) and integrin (cilengitide). Although preliminary clinical results of the use of targeted agents have not translated into significantly better survival, more recent phase II trials are exploring the combination of multitargeted drugs with cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy in order to overcome the resistance of tumors to single-agent targeted therapies.

The patients' median age at diagnosis was 47 years, with a range from 3 to 76 years; 6% of the oligodendrogliomas occurred in children. The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 20.5 months (mean 43 months). Plain skull x-ray films showed calcified deposits in 28% of the tumors. At operation, most of the tumors were poorly defined, without cyst formation, hematoma necrosis, or calcification. The median duration of disease from onset of symptoms until death was 14 months in nine untreated cases. In surgically treated oligodendroglioma patients the median survival time from onset of symptoms was 74 months. The median postoperative survival time was 35 months (mean 52 months). Tumor calcification, as seen on plain skull x-ray films, was associated with a significantly longer survival period. The surgical findings of gross necrosis, gross hypervascularity, and soft tumor consistency were all related to a shorter total duration of disease. Grossly well demarcated lesions were associated with a significantly longer postoperative survival. The length of postoperative survival correlated with the preoperative clinical status. The cumulative proportion of patients surviving 5 years was 0.342. The patient's age and sex did not have a statistically significant influence on survival time. The extent of surgical excision only seemed to play a role when the neurosurgeon considered that he had removed the whole lesion: these patients had a median postoperative survival period 14 months longer than the other oligodendroglioma patients. The ABO blood group of the oligodendroglioma patient was of prognostic value. In particular, patients with blood group A had a distinctly poorer prognosis than patients with O or B blood.

        "Doc_abstract":"The nuclear matrix and its role in cell physiology are largely unknown, and the discovery of any matrix constituent whose expression is tissue- and/or cell-specific offers a new avenue of exploration. Studies of the novel neuronal nuclear matrix protein, NRP/B, reveal that it is an early and highly specific marker of neuronal induction and development in vertebrates, since its expression is restricted mainly to the developing and mature nervous system. These studies also show that NRP/B is involved in neuronal differentiation. To further examine the structure-function of NRP/B, we have cloned and characterized the murine Nrp/b gene. The murine gene consists of four exons interrupted by three introns that span 7.6kb of DNA. The complete open reading frame is localized in exon 3, suggesting that NRP/B is highly conserved during evolution. Chromosomal analysis shows that NRP/B is localized to chromosome 13 in mouse and chromosome 5q12-13 in human. Since our previous studies demonstrated that NRP/B is expressed in primary hippocampal neurons but not in primary astrocytes, we have characterized NRP/B mRNA and protein expression in various brain cell lines and in human brain tumors. Abundant expression of NRP/B mRNA and protein was observed in human neuroblastoma cell lines (IMR32, SKN-MC, SKN-SH), in glioblastoma cell lines (A172, T98G, U87-MG, U118-MG, U138-MG, and U373-MG), in neuroglioma (H4) and astrocytoma cell lines (CCF-STTG1 and SW1088). Confocal analysis of NRP/B in U87-MG glioblastoma cells indicated nuclear localization of NRP/B. NRP/B expression was also observed in human primary brain tumors including glioblastoma multiformae and astrocytomas (total of five cases). These results suggest that NRP/B expression is upregulated in human brain tumors including glioblastomas and astrocytomas, while under normal conditions NRP/B expression is restricted to neurons. This study implicates a role for NRP/B in brain tumor development.",

The aim of the study was to determine the lncRNA expression profile in astrocytomas and to assess its potential clinical value. We performed a three-step analysis to establish the lncRNA profile for astrocytoma: a) the lncRNA expression was examined on 3 astrocytomas as well as 3 NATs (normal adjacent tissues) using the lncRNA microarray; b) the top-hits were validated in 40 astrocytomas (WHO grade II-IV) by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR); c) the hits with significant differences were re-evaluated using qRT-PCR in 90 astrocytomas. Finally, 7 lncRNAs were found to have a significantly different expression profile in astrocytoma samples compared to the NAT samples. Unsupervised clustering analysis further revealed the potential of the 7-lncRNA profile to differentiate between tumors and NAT samples. The upregulation of ENST00000545440 and NR_002809 was associated with advanced clinical stages of astrocytoma. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, we showed that the low expression of BC002811 or XLOC_010967, or the high expression of NR_002809 was significantly associated with poor patient survival. Moreover, Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that this prognostic impact was independent of other clinicopathological factors. Our results indicate that the lncRNA profile may be a potential prognostic biomarker for the prediction of post-surgical outcomes. ",

Deletion analysis of subcloned fragments identified several regulatory elements. A major positive cis-acting element was localized between base pairs -290/-186. A second positive regulatory element was localized between -454/-280 and negative regulatory elements were present in the region between bp -828/-454. The sequence -280/-186 conferred B cell-specific expression on a heterologous, TATA box containing c-fos promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with overlapping oligonucleotide probes spanning -280/-186 revealed that a 25-bp probe (-225/-201) bound a nuclear protein present in B cell lines expressing the CD20/B1 antigen but not in Jurkat (T cell), U937 (promonocytic), U251 (glioma), or HeLa cells. To confirm the functional significance of this sequence, a trimer of this region was subcloned into the c-fos promoter containing CAT plasmid. Expression was observed only in BJA-B and HS-Sultan cells but not in CD20/B1- cell lines. This sequence element is also important in phorbol ester-induced CD20 expression in the pre-B cell line BP-697.

Daily weights, neurological findings and survival time were examined. MRI scan was performed after neurological deterioration and histological examination was also performed after death. CLN-IgG MoAb was used for treatment and 15 nude mice which were inoculated with tumor cells into the cisterna magna (Day 0) were divided into three groups of 5 mice each. Group A was control group which received saline into the cisterna magna, Group B and C received 50 micrograms of CLN-IgG into the cisterna magna on Day 2 or Day 7 following inoculation of tumor cells. Efficacy of experimental immunotherapy was statistically evaluated by the difference of median survival time (MST) among three groups. All of the nude mice lost weight within 4 or 5 days after inoculation of tumor cells and developed paraplegia or tetraplegia with incontinence and died.

Potential biomedical applications of this compound include the fabrication of hydrogels by radical polymerization (e.g., cell encapsulation or drug delivery) and the thermal sensitization of cancerous cells to induce localized cell death. In this study we evaluated whether this compound could induce cell death at 37 degrees C in vitro and in vivo using a tumor animal model. Cytotoxicity was quantitated with a sulfo-rhodamine B colorimetric assay by monitoring growth inhibition of human glioma cells in vitro. AIPC was entrapped in fibrin gel and exposed to cells in culture as a potential way to localize the compound in a controlled release environment. The mechanism of action for cell death was evaluated by quantitating caspase-3 activity in cells. In vivo studies included human glioma tumors that were grown subcutaneously in rats to study the effect of intra-tumor injections of AIPC. AIPC was also injected subcutaneously into normal tissue. Concentrations of 0.2% and 0.02% (w/v in RPMI medium) showed 93% and 84% inhibition of cell growth in vitro, respectively. Cell-growth inhibition using gel-entrapped AIPC was comparable to that obtained with AIPC in solution after 48 hr (86% inhibition at 0.2% w/v). Exposure to AIPC resulted in a significant increase of caspase activity (up to 163 units after 20 min), suggesting induced apoptosis as a possible mechanism of action of the AIPC.

Here, we evaluated the antitumor effects of NK cell-based immunotherapy by serial noninvasive imaging of apoptosis using a caspase-3 sensor in mice with human glioma xenografts. Human glioma cells expressing both a caspase-3 sensor as a surrogate marker for caspase-3 activation and Renilla luciferase (Rluc) as a surrogate marker for cell viability were established and referred to as D54-CR cells. Human NK92 cells were used as effector cells. Treatment with NK92 cells resulted in a time- and effector number-dependent increase in bioluminescence imaging (BLI) activity of the caspase-3 sensor in D54-CR cells in vitro. Caspase-3 activation by NK92 treatment was blocked by Z-VAD treatment in D54-CR cells. Transfusion of NK92 cells induced an increase of the BLI signal by caspase-3 activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in D54-CR tumor-bearing mice but not in PBS-treated mice. Accordingly, sequential BLI with the Rluc reporter gene revealed marked retardation of tumor growth in the NK92-treatment group but not in the PBS-treatment group. These data suggest that noninvasive imaging of apoptosis with a caspase-3 sensor can be used as an effective tool for evaluation of therapeutic efficacy as well as for optimization of NK cell-based immunotherapy.-Lee, H.

We have compared the hybridization pattern of the CALLA gene from leukemic and normal cells digested with several restriction enzymes. No alterations were noticed with Eco RI, Sac I, Pvu II, Eco RV, Hind III, and Msp I. Since CALLA is also found on other malignancies, we analyzed DNA samples prepared from cell lines derived from leukemia, lymphoma, glioblastoma, retinoblastoma, and neuroblastoma. Normal restriction patterns were observed for all the lines regardless of their CALLA phenotype. Having demonstrated previously that CALLA was structurally identical to neutral endopeptidase 3.4.24.11 (NEP), we have now established a correlation between surface expression of CALLA and NEP activity on leukemia samples and on several cell lines. Malignant cells tested expressed a functionally active enzyme and no gross alteration was present in the CALLA gene. The CD44 gene is expressed on most cells of hemopoietic origin and on greater than 95% of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloblastic leukemia studied. It is also expressed on normal astrocytes and on malignant cells of glioma/astrocytoma types. We now report that a similar pattern of hybridization was observed with Sac I, Pvu II, and Eco RI for leukemic samples, normal cells, and malignant cell lines. A polymorphism was recently detected for CD44 using Hind III; leukemic cells and malignant lines also showed this normal polymorphism. Thus no deletion or insertion could be detected in the CD44 gene of leukemic cells and malignant lines, suggesting that no gross DNA alterations were involved. The correlation between surface expression and enzymatic activity of CD10/CALLA and the expression of CD44 on a variety of malignant cells would suggest that the structure and function of these two gene products are probably not altered by the process of transformation.",

Little is known about the immune status of intracranial tumor patients during the post operative survival period. We thus investigated total T cells (CD 11+), helper/inducer (CD4+) T cells, suppressor/cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells, B cells (CD19+) and serum immunoglobulins in peripheral blood in certain ICT patients before and after treatment, and based on the histological type of the tumors. Post treatment analysis were conducted 30 days after surgical removal of tumor tissue in benign brain tumor patients and 30 days after chemo therapy (CT)/radiotherapy (RT) following surgical removal of tumor tissue in malignant brain tumor patients. Decreased CD11+, CD4+ and increased CD8+ T cell counts were observed in both benign and malignant tumor cases before treatment compared with control subjects. After treatment, CD4+ T cell count increased and CD8+ T cell count decreased than their pre treatment levels. Serum IgA and IgG levels were decreased in both benign and malignant brain tumor patients before treatment than in control subjects. Serum IgM level has been increased in both benign and malignant tumor patients before and after treatment than in control subjects. Anaplastic malignant astrocytoma, medulloblastoma and glioblastoma multiforme patients showed higher IgM level than astrocytoma, meningioma and ependymoma patients. In conclusions, the depressed host cellular immunity in benign and malignant tumor patients before treatment may be due to the changes in CD4+ and CD8+ counts in addition to tumour specific immunosuppressive factors.

Cathepsin B inhibitors have also been considered as anticancer drug candidates; hence, there has been a growing need for a probe which enables the selective and simple detection of cathepsin B and its inhibitors. For the purpose of selective assay, a cathepsin B-specific substrate, N,N'-diBoc-dityrosine-glycine-phenylalanine-3-(methylthio)propylamine (DBDY-Gly-Phe-MTPA) was synthesized in this study. Phe-MTPA, which was produced via cathepsin B-catalyzed hydrolysis of DBDY-Gly-Phe-MTPA, allowed aggregation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) leading to a color change from red to blue. When tested for cathepsins B, L, and S, this assay method exhibited AuNPs color change only in reaction to cathepsin B. The limits of detection for cathepsin B was 10 and 5 nM in the 1 and 2 h hydrolysis reactions, respectively. The efficiency of cathepsin B inhibitors such as leupeptin, antipain, and chymostatin was easily compared by the degree of color change. Moreover, IC50 values of leupeptin, antipain, and chymostatin were found to be 0.11, 0.48, and 1.78 μM, respectively, which were similar to the results of previous studies. Therefore the colorimetric assay of cathepsin B and cathepsin B inhibitors using DBDY-Gly-Phe-MTPA and AuNPs allowed not only the selective but also the simple assay of cathepsin B and its inhibitors, which was possible with the naked eye.

A number of human tumor cell lines, particularly those established from glioma and sarcoma, have been shown to produce PDGF and express the cognate receptor type. In these instances, tumor cell growth may be enhanced by an autocrine receptor activation. In other tumor cell types, where PDGF is produced in the absence of receptor expression, the growth factor may act in a paracrine fashion.

There was no correlation between the expression of the two PDGF genes. Nonmalignant human brain tissue expressed the PDGF-R and PDGF-1 genes but not the c-sis/PDGF-2 protooncogene. In situ hybridization of astrocytoma tissue localized the expression of the c-sis and PDGF-R mRNA's in tumor cells. Capillary endothelial cells also expressed c-sis mRNA. In contrast, nonmalignant human brain tissue expressed only PDGF-R mRNA but not c-sis/PDGF-2 mRNA. The coexpression of a potent mitogenic growth factor protooncogene (c-sis) and its receptor gene in astrocytoma tumor cells suggests the presence of an autocrine mechanism that may contribute to the development and maintenance of astrocytomas.

(b) To validate the fully automatic CT/MET-PET image fusion technique with respect to accuracy and robustness. (c) To give a short glance at the clinical consequences for patients with brain tumors.;In 12 patients with brain tumors (9 meningeomas, 3 gliomas), CT, MRI, and MET-PET were performed for stereotactic fractionated radiation treatment planning. The CT and MET-PET investigations were performed using a relocatable mask for head fixation. Fifteen external reference markers (5 on each lateral and 5 on the frontal localizer plate) that could be identified in CT and MET-PET were applied on the stereotactic localizer frame; the marker positions were exactly defined for both investigations. The MRI/CT fusion was done completely automatically. The CT/MET-PET fusion was performed using two different methods: The gold standard was the CT/PET fusion based on the reference markers, and the test method was the automatic, intensity-based CT/PET fusion, independent of the external markers. The markers visible on CT and transmission PET were matched using a point-to-line matching algorithm. To quantify the amount of misregistration, the two fusion methods were compared by calculating the mean value of deviation between corresponding points inside a cubic volume of interest of > or =512 cm(3) defined within the cranial cavity. The gross tumor volume (CT/MRI) outlined on CT and T1-MRI with contrast medium was compared with the gross tumor volume (PET) defined in the reoriented MET-PET data sets. The clinical impact of MET-PET in tumor volume definition for stereotactic radiotherapy will be discussed.;The fully automatic integration of MET-PET into stereotactic radiation treatment planning was successfully realized in all patients investigated. Mean deviation of the intensity-based automatic CT/PET fusion compared with the external marker-based gold standard was 2.4 mm; the standard deviation was 0.5. The algorithm's robustness was evaluated, and the discrepancy of fusion results due to different initial image alignments was determined to be below 1 mm inside the test volume of interest. In patients with meningiomas and gliomas, MET-PET was shown to deliver additional information concerning tumor extension.;The precision of the automatic CT/PET image fusion was high. A mean deviation of 2.4 mm is acceptable, considering that it is approximately equal to the pixel size of the PET data sets.

We report on the relative bone marrow toxicity of four model nitrosoureas with different alkylating and carbamoylating activities: 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea; 1,3-bis(trans-4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-1-nitrosourea; chlorozotozin, (2-[3-(2-chloroethyl)-3 -nitrosoureido]-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranose); and -3-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-1-nitrosourea. Inhibitions of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis in murine bone marrow cells and of colony growth of myeloid precursor cells (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units) were used as in vitro end points of myelotoxicity. Further, we determined the antiglioma activity of the four nitrosoureas on two human gliomas in a clonogenic tumor cell assay and studied the effect of the non-nitrosourea carbamoylators potassium cyanate, chloroethyl isocyanate, cyclohexyl isocyanate, ethyl isocyanate, and ethyl isothiocyanate on granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units. The results show that, at equivalent drug exposures, clonogenic glioma cell kill was significant and comparative for 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-1-nitrosourea, and chlorozotocin; 1,3-bis(trans-4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-1-nitrosourea showed little activity. In contrast, granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit toxicity was low with chlorozotocin and 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-1-nitrosourea and very high with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea and 1,3-bis(trans-4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-1-nitrosourea. Of the isocyanates, bone marrow toxicity was highest with chloroethyl isocyanate and cyclohexyl isocyanate, intermediate with ethyl isocyanate, and lowest with KOCN and ethyl isothiocyanate. Our results indicate that (a) bifunctional alkylation is essential for antiglioma activity of nitrosoureas and (b) myelosuppression is at least partly linked with carbamoylation but that structural entities in the carbamoylating isocyanate rather than a quantitative degree of carbamoylation determine the degree of potential myelotoxicity.",

An aberrant miRNA expression has been observed in GBM, being associated with impaired cellular functions resulting in malignant transformation, proliferation and invasion. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B), a potent angiogenic growth factor involved in GBM development and progression, promotes downregulation of pro-oncogenic (miR-21) and anti-oncogenic (miR-128) miRNAs, as well as upregulation/downregulation of several miRNAs involved in GBM pathology. Retrovirally mediated overexpression of PDGF-B in U87 human GBM cells or their prolonged exposure, as well as that of F98 rat glioma cells to this ligand, resulted in decreased miR-21 and miR-128 levels, which was associated with increased cell proliferation. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated PDGF-B silencing led to increased levels of miR-21 and miR-128, while miRNA modulation through overexpression of miR-21 did not alter the levels of PDGF-B. Finally, we demonstrate that modulation of tumor suppressors PTEN and p53 in U87 cells does not affect the decrease in miR-21 levels associated with PDGF-B overexpression. Overall, our findings suggest that, besides its role in inducing GBM tumorigenesis, PDGF-B may enhance tumor proliferation by modulating the expression of oncomiRs and tumor suppressor miRNAs in U87 human GBM cells.",

To examine the structures of these mRNAs, we isolated cDNA clones from rat brain and genomic DNA from rat liver. Characterization of these clones as well as Northern blot analysis indicated that the various mRNAs differed in the lengths of their 5' leader sequences. RNase protection assays revealed that the gene for alpha-crystallin B chain contains multiple start sites. The transcriptional start sites of the longer mRNAs are preceded by a putative CAAT box and that of the shorter mRNA by a putative TATA box. The shorter mRNA encodes the alpha-crystallin B chain protein, whereas the longer mRNA contained three extra small open reading frames upstream of the AUG start codon for the protein. The shorter mRNA is abundant in lens, heart, muscle, and kidney, while the longer mRNAs are constitutively expressed at low levels in a wide variety of tissues. The shorter mRNA was increased by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in rat C6 glioma cells.

Brain imaging features were suggestive of malignant glioma of the anterior visual pathway. Postoperative examination indicated a diagnosis of diffuse malignant lymphoma type B. As no evidence of extracranial lymphoma was observed, the final diagnosis was primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Following treatment with surgery and radiotherapy, the patient's symptoms went into remission. At a follow-up examination 12 months after diagnosis, the patient demonstrated no evidence of recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, PCNSL isolated to the optic chiasm has been reported only three times in immunocompetent patients. Therefore, the present case of the lymphoma involving the optic nerve, optic chiasm and optic tract in an immunocompetent patient is unusual. The present case emphasizes the importance of considering the diagnosis of lymphoma in this setting.",

Amino acid sequencing of a peptide derived from the purified protein revealed a 13 amino acid sequence with complete identity to a human heavy chain subunit of ferritin. This was confirmed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, immunoprecipitation, and western blot analysis with antiferritin antibody. In addition, hypoxia was able to induce the synthesis of ferritin in a cell line derived from human oligodendroglioma cells but not in astrocytes or neurons. Actinomycin D (1-15 micrograms/ml) treatment did not block the hypoxic induction of ferritin synthesis, whereas cycloheximide (1 microM) gave complete inhibition. Northern blot analysis showed that ferritin mRNA levels remained unchanged in both control and hypoxic oligodendrocytes and human oligodendroglioma cells, suggesting that the synthesis of ferritin was translationally rather than transcriptionally regulated by hypoxia. In neither oligodendrocytes nor the oligodendroglioma was there any cross-reaction with an antibody to alpha B-crystallin, the 22-kDa protein induced in astrocytes by various types of stress, further suggesting the specificity of hypoxic induction of ferritin in oligodendrocytes.",

We studied the effects of estradiol, progesterone and their receptor antagonists (ICI 182,780 and RU 486) on PR isoforms content in U373 and D54 human astrocytoma cell lines, respectively derived from grades III and IV astrocytomas, by Western blot analysis.

In both cell lines, PR isoforms content was down-regulated by progesterone after estradiol treatment. This effect was blocked by RU 486.

The molecular alterations that lead to the multinucleated cell phenotype of gcGB have not been elucidated. Giant cell GB has a higher frequency of the tumor suppressor protein p53 mutations than GB, however, and a role for the mitotic Aurora B kinase has been suggested. We analyzed Aurora B expression in gcGB (n = 28) and GB (n = 54) patient tumor samples by immunohistochemistry; 17 gcGB and 22 GB samples were analyzed at the DNA and mRNA levels. No mutations in the Aurora B gene (AURKB) were found, but its mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in gcGB than in GB. Fifty-nine percent of gcGB samples but only 18% of the GB samples showed p53 mutations. Ectopic overexpression of Aurora B induced a significant increase inthe proportion of multinucleated cells in p53 mutant U373-MG, but not in p53 wild-type U87-MG, glioma cells. RNAi of p53 in U87-MG cells led to an increase in the fraction of multinucleated cells that was further augmented by ectopic overexpression of Aurora B. These results suggest that loss of p53 function and dysregulated Aurora B protein levels might represent factors that drive the development of multinucleated cells in gcGB.",

The pentamer, termed the B-oligomer, consisting of the residual subunits was the moiety of IAP that was responsible for binding to the cell surface, as revealed by competitive inhibition of the development of the IAP actions on intact rat C6 glioma cells and rat adipocytes. The binding of the B-oligomer to its receptor proteins was divalent via the constituent two dimers; it stimulated mitosis of lymphocytes and caused an insulin-like action to enhance glucose oxidation in adipocytes, just as did concanavalin A, presumably as a result of cross-linking or aggregation of the membrane proteins. The A-promoter displayed its biological action on adipocytes only when the B-oligomer had been bound to the cells. Thus, IAP is a typical A-B toxin in which the B-oligomer is first bound to the cell surface proteins to enable the A-protomer to reach to the site of its action within the cell. Diverse biological actions of pertussis toxin may be accounted for by the mitogenic action of the B-oligomer as well as ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the A-promoter.",

The tumors were examined for loss of heterozygosity with markers from chromosomes 9p, 10, and 17p and for amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. In each case, the high grade portion of the tumor displayed at least one of these structural alterations. However, identical alterations were found in the associated low grade or satellitosis areas of each tumor. Our data suggest that: (a) genetic alterations associated with tumor progression already occur in histopathologically low grade areas of high grade astrocytoma; (b) satellitosis associated with a high grade astrocytoma has to be considered as part of that tumor; and (c) tissue heterogeneity within a high grade astrocytoma is not a consequence of differences in DNA constitution at the loci that were examined.",

The level of PMC expression is highest in CD4-8-, intermediate in CD4+8+, and lowest in J11d-, CD4, or CD8 single-positive thymocytes. PKC is equally expressed by all three thymic populations. In striking contrast to thymocytes, resting peripheral lymph node T cells and T-cell clones express little if any PMC and reduced levels of PKC. Neither PKC nor PMC is significantly induced upon the activation of lymph node T cells: treatment with anti-CD3 antibodies or anti-CD3 and interleukin-2 fails to induce PKC, whereas PMC is not induced by anti-CD3 alone and is only slightly induced by anti-CD3 and interleukin-2. In contrast to the situation with T cells, PMC and PKC are constitutively expressed at moderate levels in mature B cells. PMC is greatly increased in B-cell blasts generated by cross-linking the antigen receptor with anti-immunoglobulin.

Three patients who were lost to follow-up review were excluded, as were two whose original slides could not be obtained and three whose tumors were diagnosed at recurrence or at autopsy. The pathological material of the remaining 51 patients was reviewed using two sets of histological criteria. Thirteen patients (Group A) had \"pure\" gemistocytic astrocytoma, defined as a glial tumor with more than 60% gemistocytes/high-power field and a background of fibrillary astrocytes. Fifteen patients (Group B) had \"mixed\" gemistocytic astrocytoma, defined as a glial tumor with 20% to 60% gemistocytes/high-power field and a background of anaplastic astrocytes. Twenty-three tumors did not meet these criteria and were excluded from analysis. The median age of the patients was 48.5 years in Group A and 38.3 years in Group B (p less than 0.05). In both groups, the median Karnofsky Performance Scale score was greater than 90%. All patients underwent surgical procedures (four total and 19 partial resections, and five biopsies) and postoperative radiation therapy. The majority also had interstitial brachytherapy, chemotherapy, or both. Ten patients had one reoperation for tumor recurrence and one had two reoperations; other treatments for recurrence included brachytherapy, chemotherapy, and repeat irradiation. All four patients who originally underwent gross total resection are still alive; all five who had a biopsy have died. There was no significant difference in median survival times between groups: 136.5 weeks in Group A (range 10 to 310+ weeks) and 135.6 weeks in Group B (range 31 to 460+ weeks). Analysis of all 28 patients showed a better prognosis for patients less than 50 years of age (185 vs. 36 weeks survival time; p less than 0.001), patients with preoperative symptoms lasting for more than 6 months (228.1 vs. 110.2 weeks survival time; p less than 0.05), and patients with seizures as the first symptom (185.7 vs. 80 weeks survival time; p less than 0.01). Survival time did not correlate with the presence of perivascular lymphocytic infiltration.

A higher level of melatonin was demonstrated in cultured ApoE4-C6 cells than that in ApoE3-C6 cells. In addition, we found that N-acetyltransferase (NAT) protein level was up-regulated in ApoE4-C6 cells compared with ApoE3-C6 cells. Further study suggested that mRNA expression of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) decreased in ApoE4-C6 cells. In conclusion, the increased melatonin level in ApoE4-C6 cells results from up-regulation of NAT expression, a key enzyme for melatonin synthesis, and down-regulation of MAOA and MAOB expression, the metabolic enzyme for its precursor serotonin.",

To further explore the potential molecular mechanism that inhibits tumor growth induced by interference of VEGF expression, we constructed a Lv-shVEGF vector and assessed the efficiency of VEGF silencing and its influence in U2OS cells. The data demonstrate that Lv-shVEGF has high inhibition efficiency on VEGF expression, which inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis of U2OS cells in vitro. Our results also indicate that inhibition of VEGF expression suppresses osteosarcoma tumor growth in vivo and reduces osteosarcoma angiogenesis. We also found that the activations of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT) were considerably reduced after osteosarcoma cells were treated with Lv-shVEGF. Taken together, our data demonstrate that VEGF silencing suppresses cell proliferation, promotes cell apoptosis, and reduces osteosarcoma angiogenesis through inactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

With some exceptions, cellular morphology is the single most accurate predictor of the prospective behavior of neoplasms. There is generally a positive correlation between the degree of malignancy and prognosis. The exceptions are a) morphologically malignant-appearing tumors following a benign course (e.g., canine histiocytoma, canine seminoma, equine sarcoid) and b) morphologically differentiated tumors exhibiting an unpredictable prognosis (e.g., canine pericytoma, acanthomatous epulis, myxoma, follicular thyroid cell carcinoma, etc.). Anaplasia, an important characteristic of most malignant neoplasms, may be less stable than generally assumed. Sodium butyrate may reverse it intermittently and anaplastic gliomas may loose all morphologic and cytokinetic characteristics of anaplasia following sodium butyrate exposure. Host factors, such as nerve growth factor, have similar and more lasting effects upon anaplastic cells derived from the neural crest. Such factors may act as reverse transformation agents and may represent prospective therapeutic agents for anaplastic tumors.",

Both antisense methods resulted in a decrease in S100 beta levels in the cell, as measured by RIA. The inhibition of S100 beta production correlated with three alterations in cellular phenotype: (a) a flattened cell morphology; (b) a more organized microfilament network; and (c) a decrease in cell growth rate.

The aim of the study is to assess the impact of the bifunctional chelator (BFC) (DOTA vs. DTPA or DTPA-Bn) on the biodistribution characteristics of the (111)In-labeled 3P-RGD(2). IC(50) values of DOTA-3P-RGD(2), DTPA-3P-RGD(2) and DTPA-Bn-3P-RGD(2) were determined to be 1.3 ± 0.2, 1.4 ± 0.3, 1.3 ± 0.3 nM, respectively, against (125)I-c(RGDyK) bound to U87MG human glioma cells. Radiotracers were prepared by reacting (111)InCl(3) with the RGD peptide conjugates in NH(4)OAc buffer (100 mM, pH 5.5). For DOTA-3P-RGD(2), successful radiolabeling could be completed by heating the reaction mixture at 100°C for 15-20 min. For DTPA-3P-RGD(2) and DTPA-Bn-3P-RGD(2), the radiolabeling was almost instantaneous at room temperature. The specific activity was ~50 mCi/mg (or ~100 mCi/μmol) for (111)In(DOTA-3P-RGD(2)) and ~200 mCi/mg (or ~400 mCi/μmol) for (111)In(DTPA-3P-RGD(2)). The results from biodistribution studies showed that all the three radiotracers have high tumor uptake and excellent tumor-to-background (T/B) ratios up to 4-h postinjection. After that time point, both (111)In(DTPA-3P-RGD(2)) and (111)In(DTPA-Bn-3P-RGD(2)) showed a much faster tumor washout and poorer T/B ratios than (111)In(DOTA-3P-RGD(2)).

The lesions are typically solitary. The majority of the lesions are located in the periventricular area, whereas in a few cases they are located in the supratentorial area. Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas constitute most PCNSLs, whereas T-cell, low-grade, anaplastic, and Hodgkin lymphomas are rarely encountered. The morphology of PCNSL shows a characteristic angiocentric pattern and is positive for B-cell markers by immunohistochemistry. The differential diagnosis of PCNSL includes central nervous system gliomas, metastatic tumors, demyelinating disorders, subacute infarcts, and space-occupying lesions due to an infectious etiology. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of PCNSL and the identification of molecular biomarkers have lagged behind that of systemic nodal lymphomas.

In order to identify potentially useful prognostic factors and to assess the effectiveness of a new grading system, the 79 patients in the previously analyzed series for whom adequate follow-up could be obtained (52%) were entered in the present analysis. Statistical analysis demonstrated that contrast enhancement and endothelial hyperplasia had powerful and similar influence on survival. Median survival with and without contrast enhancement were: 3 versus 11 years, and with or without endothelial hyperplasia were: 3.5 versus 11 years. Conversely, the degree of nuclear atypia and presence or absence of mitosis or necrosis were not correlated with survival. These findings allowed us to devise a simple grading system which discriminates two malignancy grades as follows: absence of endothelial hyperplasia and of contrast enhancement = Grade A, presence of endothelial hyperplasia and/or of contrast enhancement = Grade B. Of the 79 oligodendrogliomas in this study, 59 tumors were categorized as grade A and 20 as grade B. Median survival were: 11 years in grade A and 3.5 years in grade B.

Loss-of-function mutations in the stefin B gene (CSTB) gene were reported in patients with Unverricht-Lundborg disease (EPM1). Our previous results showed that thymocytes isolated from stefin B-deficient mice are more sensitive to apoptosis induced by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor staurosporin (STS) than the wild-type control cells. We have also shown that the increased expression of stefin B in the nucleus of T98G astrocytoma cells delayed cell cycle progression through the S phase. In the present study we examined if the nuclear or cytosolic functions of stefin B are responsible for the accelerated induction of apoptosis observed in the cells from stefin B-deficient mice. We have shown that the overexpression of stefin B in the nucleus, but not in the cytosol of astrocytoma T98G cells, delayed caspase-3 and -7 activation. Pretreatment of cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone completely inhibited caspase activation, while treatment with the inhibitor of calpains- and papain-like cathepsins (2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido-3-methyl-butane ethyl ester did not prevent caspase activation. We concluded that the delay of caspase activation in T98G cells overexpressing stefin B in the nucleus is independent of cathepsin inhibition.",

In infected individuals the JCV genome can be detected in brain tissue and B lymphocytes isolated from the blood, bone marrow, or lymph nodes. Using mobility shift assays and a radiolabeled oligonucleotide from the JCV promoter-enhancer region (JCV bp 130 to 160), referred to as domain B, we were able to detect specific bands of the same mobility in nuclear extracts from human fetal glial cells, U-251 glioma cells, different B-cell lines, and in vitro-activated tonsillar B lymphocytes but not from T cells. In addition, a specific shift was detected when using nuclear extracts from freshly isolated tonsillar or lymph node B cells from five AIDS patients, two of whom later developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Somewhat surprisingly, the above gel shift was partially inhibited by unlabeled oligonucleotides containing a kappa E2-binding site. UV cross-linking of the protein-DNA complex from either B cells or glial cells and analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of a 46-kDa band. Transient transfection of a reporter plasmid constructed by fusing a trimer of the domain B sequence to a minimal promoter revealed activity in B lymphocytes and glial cells but not in T cells. Mutational analysis of this region demonstrated that the core TGGC repeat was essential for enhancer activity. Thus, a similar protein in B lymphocytes and glial cells may account for the preferential replication of JCV in these two cell types.",

Biochemical assays indicated that ON123300 was a strong inhibitor of Ark5 and CDK4, as well as growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases such as β-type platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRβ). ON123300 inhibited U87 glioma cell proliferation with an IC(50) 3.4 ± 0.1 μmol/L and reduced phosphorylation of Akt, yet it also unexpectedly induced Erk activation, both in a dose- and time-dependent manner that subsequently was attributed to relieving Akt-mediated C-Raf S259 inactivation and activating a p70S6K-initiated PI3K-negative feedback loop. Cotreatment with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib produced synergistic cytotoxic effects. Pursuant to the in vitro studies, in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of ON123300 were completed in mice bearing intracerebral U87 tumors following intravenous doses of 5 and 25 mg/kg alone, and also at the higher dose concurrently with gefitinib. ON123300 showed high brain and brain tumor accumulation based on brain partition coefficient values of at least 2.5. Consistent with the in vitro studies, single agent ON123300 caused a dose-dependent suppression of phosphorylation of Akt as well as activation of Erk in brain tumors, whereas addition of gefitinib to the ON123300 regimen significantly enhanced p-Akt inhibition and prevented Erk activation. In summary, ON123300 demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics, and future development for brain tumor therapy would require use of combinations, such as gefitinib, that mitigate its Erk activation and enhance its activity.",

None of these lesions had apparent hemorrhage based on T1-weighted image (T1WI). The DWI was performed using a 1.5-T system, single-shot spin-echo echo-planar pulse sequence with b=1000 s/mm(2). The ADC was calculated using a two-point linear regression method at b=0 and b=1000 s/mm(2). The ratio (ADCR) of the lesion ADC to control region ADC was also measured.;Increased signal was seen in all of the pyogenic abscess cavities to variable degrees on DWI. In vivo ADC maps showed restricted diffusion in the abscess cavity in all pyogenic abscesses [0.65+/-0.16 x 10(-3) (mean+/-S.D.) mm(2)/s, mean ADCR=0.63]. The case with multiple toxoplasmosis abscesses showed low signal intensity on DWI and high ADC values (mean 1.9 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, ADCR=2.24). All cystic or necrotic tumors but one showed low signal intensity on DWI and their cystic or necrotic areas had high ADC values (2.70+/-0.31 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, mean ADCR=3.42). One fibrillary low-grade astrocytoma had a high DWI signal intensity and a low ADC value in its central cystic area (0.44 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, ADCR=0.49). Postcontrast T1WIs yielded a sensitivity of 60%, a specificity of 27.27%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 52.94%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 33.33% in the diagnosis of necrotic tumors. DWI yielded a sensitivity of 93.33%, a specificity of 90.91%, a PPV of 93.33%, and a NPV of 90.91%.

Determination and analysis of lamin B expression was achieved stereologically with the use of computerised interactive image analysis. The average stereological surface density of the lamin-positive nuclear surface of cells showing evidence of lamin degradation cells was 13.80 mm2/mm3 in LGA and 21.02 mm2/mm3 in HGA. The average range of immunopositivity of p27 and pRB expression was 2.85 and 2.10, respectively, in LGA and 1.80 and 0.88, respectively, in HGA. The rate of apoptosis indirectly correlated with the expression of both p27 and pRB but was not fully significant (P < or = 0.09). Our findings suggest that there may be a loss of function of main cell-cycle regulators and increased uncontrolled cell death in addition to increased cell proliferation in high-grade astrocytomas. Moreover, we believe that the detection of lamin B degradation in astroglial tumours can be an alternative, precise and convenient assay for the detection of a defined set of apoptotic cells. However, before being applied more generally, comparative research should be done on different methods of quantifying apoptosis, with the intent of finding the difference between biologically different methods.

        "Doc_abstract":"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using a photosensitizer, such as haematoporphyrin derivative (HpD), in conjunction with visible light is a promising new modality to treat localized cancer. Cell death caused by PDT (through the generation of reactive oxygen species) can occur either by apoptosis (interphase death or as a secondary event following mitosis) and/or necrosis depending on the cell type, concentration and intracellular localization of the sensitizer, and the light dose. Since, apoptosis induced by PDT treatment plays an important role in determining the photodynamic efficacy, in the present work we have investigated the role of apoptotic cell death in relation to the observed differences in sensitivity to HpD-PDT between a human glioma cell line (BMG-1) carrying wild-type tumour suppressor gene p53 and a human squamous carcinoma cell line (4451) with mutated p53. HpD (photosan-3; PS-3) -PDT induced apoptosis was studied by: [A] flow-cytometric analysis of DNA content (sub G0/G1 population); [B] phosphatidylserine externalization (Annexin-V +ve cells); [C] cell size and cytoskeleton reorganization (light-scatter analysis); and [D] fluorescence microscopy (morphological features). PS-3-PDT induced a significantly higher level of apoptosis in BMG-1 cells as compared to 4451 cells. This was dependent on the concentration of PS-3 as well as post-irradiation time in both the cell lines. At 2.5 microg/ml of PS-3 the fraction of BMG-1 cells undergoing apoptosis (60%) was nearly 6 folds higher than 4451 cells (10%). In BMG-1 cells the induction of apoptosis increased with PS-3 concentration up to 5 microg/ml (>80%). However, a decrease was observed at a concentration of 10 microg/ml, possibly due to a shift in the mode of cell death from apoptosis to necrosis. In 4451 cells, on the other hand, the increase in apoptosis could be observed even up to 10 microg/ml of PS-3 (60%). Present results show that the higher sensitivity to PS-3-PDT in glioma cells arise on account of a higher level of apoptosis and suggest that induction of apoptosis is an important determinant of photodynamic sensitivity in certain cell types.",

VT is implicated in hemorrhagic colitis and the more serious hemolytic uremic syndrome. VT1 is active against various tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo. To extend the anti-cancer spectrum of activity of VT to human brain tumors, in the present analysis we studied the effects of VT on the growth of 6 permanent human astrocytoma cell lines.

VT induced apoptosis in these cells was shown by electron microscopy. Morphological evidence (nuclear shrinkage and chromatin condensation) of apoptosis could be clearly distinguished 1.5 hrs after toxin addition. Ultrastructural preservation of organelles was observed in conjunction with blebbing of the plasma membrane, condensation of chromatin within the nucleus and nuclear shrinkage.

The aim of this study was to see whether the IDH1 codon 132 mutations occur in other human cancers besides glial tumors. We also attempted to confirm the occurrence of the IDH1 mutations in GBM of Korean patients. We have analyzed 1,186 cancer tissues from various origins, including carcinomas from breast, colon, lung, stomach, esophagus, liver, prostate, urinary bladder, ovary, uterine cervix, skin and kidney, and malignant mesotheliomas, primary GBM, malignant meningiomas, multiple myelomas and acute leukemias by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. We found four IDH1 codon 132 mutations in the GBM (4/25; 16.0%), two in the prostate carcinomas (2/75; 2.7%) and one in the B-acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL) (1/60; 1.7%), but none in other cancers. The IDH1 mutations consisted of five p.R132H and two p.R132C mutations. The data indicate that IDH1 codon 132 mutations occur not only in GBM, but also in prostate cancers and B-ALL.

The concentration independence of b and d indicated that both cell proliferation and cell death kinetics were independent of the drug treatment, which suggests constant times for cell cycle and apoptosis. The concentration dependence of c suggests that the time until the cells started regrowing depended on the treatment, repair mechanisms taking longer after heavy damage. The two-term exponential model predicted tumor repopulation in this in vitro system. These results indicated that the velocities of the logarithm of cell growth and cell death were independent of drug treatment, while the recovery time of the tumor repopulation was dependent on the drug dose.

We previously demonstrated that the isoform containing the extra domain B sequence of fibronectin (B-FN), a complete type-III-homology repeat, is a marker of angiogenesis that accumulates around neovasculature only during angiogenic processes. We produced a single-chain human recombinant antibody (scFv), L19, which reacts specifically with B-FN and selectively targets tumor vasculature in vivo. We used this scFv and an antibody against a pan-endothelial marker (Factor VIII) in a double-staining procedure on specimens of low- and high-grade astrocytomas to determine the percentage of B-FN-positive vessels, (denominating the resulting value angiogenic index [AI]). Compared to vascular density and proliferative activity (evaluated using antibodies to Factor VIII and Ki67, respectively), AI correlated better with tumor grade (1.6 +/- 2.6% and 92.0 +/- 8.7% of B-FN-positive vessels in low- and high-grade astrocytomas, respectively) and was a more precise diagnostic tool than either of the two conventional methods. In fact, discriminating analysis using these three parameters showed that only AI accurately classified 100% of the cases studied, compared to 64% and 89% correctly diagnosed by vascular density and of proliferating cells, respectively.",

Furthermore, invasive tumors are shown to have a different genomic composition and metabolic abnormalities that allow for a more aggressive GBM phenotype and resistance to therapy. We thus seek to identify those genomic abnormalities associated with a highly aggressive and invasive GBM imaging-phenotype.;We retrospectively identified 104 treatment-naïve glioblastoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) whom had gene expression profiles and corresponding MR imaging available in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The standardized VASARI feature-set criteria were used for the qualitative visual assessments of invasion. Patients were assigned to classes based on the presence (Class A) or absence (Class B) of statistically significant invasion parameters to create an invasive imaging signature; imaging genomic analysis was subsequently performed using GenePattern Comparative Marker Selection module (Broad Institute).;Our results show that patients with a combination of deep white matter tracts and ependymal invasion (Class A) on imaging had a significant decrease in overall survival as compared to patients with absence of such invasive imaging features (Class B) (8.7 versus 18.6 months, p < 0.001). Mitochondrial dysfunction was the top canonical pathway associated with Class A gene expression signature. The MYC oncogene was predicted to be the top activation regulator in Class A.;We demonstrate that MRI biomarker signatures can identify distinct GBM phenotypes associated with highly significant survival differences and specific molecular pathways. This study identifies mitochondrial dysfunction as the top canonical pathway in a very aggressive GBM phenotype.

The occurrence of MAO-B enzyme protein depends on the degree of cellular differentiation as demonstrated by studies on astrocytes in primary cultures analyzed at two different stages of maturation. Highly differentiated cells exhibited high relative enzyme concentration whereas glioblasts lacked or showed very low contents of MAO-B enzyme. This was further substantiated by studies performed on human astrocytoma tissue using 3H-L-deprenyl emulsion autoradiography in combination with immunohistochemical detection of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Regional increases of MAO-B concentration were found in ALS lumbar sections with quantitative 3H-L-deprenyl autoradiography. On the basis of results obtained from double staining for GFAP and MAO-B, the increase in MAO-B seemed to be due to an increased number of astrocytes as well as an increased content of MAO-B in reactive species of astrocytes. A cell culture model has been used that produces cells with morphology and GFAP-content similar to reactive cells. These astrocytes exhibited high relative content of the MAO-B enzyme protein. In the light of the presented data, taking into account the finding that a subpopulation of reactive cells contained low levels of MAO-B, a heterogeneity among reactive astrocytes was observed.",

Thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, T3) regulates glial functions such as myelination and both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes have been shown to express thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). To study putative effects of v-erbA on glial precursors, we have expressed it in a glial clonal cell line established from early embryonal mouse brain. We have found that v-erbA increases cell survival in serum-free conditions. Moreover, v-erbA-expressing cells show a substantial growth in the presence of insulin or IGF-I, whereas normal and TR/c-erbA-over-expressing cells progressively degenerate. By Northern blotting, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and neutralization experiments, we show that v-erbA actions are mediated by an increase in the levels of PDGF B/c-sis mRNA and protein. We used anti-PDGF receptor and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to show the constitutive activation of PDGF receptors in B3.1 + v-erbA cells, and neutralizing anti-PDGF antibodies to demonstrate that v-erbA enhances the secretion of active PDGF into the culture medium.

This finding infers a direct link between the molecular biology of normal mitogenesis and oncogenesis since it suggests that the transforming activity of SSV is caused by a growth factor. Although PDGF agonist activity has been isolated from conditioned medium of SSV-transformed cells, it is not clear whether infection of responsive cells by SSV leads solely to autocrine stimulation of growth by a secreted PDGF-like factor or whether other, possibly intracellular, activities of p28sis or its processed products contribute to the transformation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we have studied the effect of anti-PDGF antibodies on acute SSV-transformation, and report here that these antibodies inhibit both proliferation and SSV-induced morphological changes in human diploid fibroblasts.",

The direct biotinylation of doxorubicin improved cell internalization in rat glioma (BT4C) cells expressing avidin fusion protein receptor but cell toxicity was reduced by 78-fold due to impaired nuclear localization. In contrast, liposomal formulations restored the biological activity of the DOX in several cell lines. However, mainly due to uptake via non-specific pathways the active targeting of BL-DOX was negligible in both in vitro and in vivo studies.

No-carrier-added [125I]IBDG was synthesized by a radioiododestannylation approach in > 75% overall radiochemical yield and > 99% radiochemical purity. [125I]IBDG was evaluated as a substrate using beta-galactosidase-expressing (D54L) and nonexpressing (D54) human glioma cell lines.

Systemic delivery of [125I]IBDG in nude mice bearing D54L tumors failed to show significant trapping of radioactivity within these tumors by SPECT imaging. In contrast, intratumoral injection of the substrate resulted in efficient trapping of radioactivity in D54L tumors but not D54 tumors, resulting in clear SPECT visualization of the former tumor.

Characteristically, the cell death was not accompanied by loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, cytosolic release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, or the activation of the caspase cascade. Consistent with these characteristics, this ceramide-induced cell death was inhibited neither by the overexpression of Bcl-xL nor by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. However, strikingly, the ceramide-induced non-apoptotic cell death was inhibited by the activation of the Akt/protein kinase B pathway through the expression of a constitutively active version of Akt. The results for the first time indicate that the Akt kinase, known to play an essential role in survival factor-mediated inhibition of apoptotic cell death, is also involved in the regulation of non-apoptotic PCD.",

Evaluation of tumor CE and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was based on region of interest measurements within the tumor and remote normal brain.;With B22956/1 (group A), CE increased by 93% in comparison with gadobenate dimeglumine (15.0 +/- 5.3 vs. 7.8 +/- 2.7; P = 0.010) and by 136% in comparison with gadopentetate dimeglumine (15.0 +/- 5.3 vs. 6.4 +/- 1.9; P = 0.013). CNR using B22956/1 increased by 116% in comparison with gadobenate dimeglumine (14.0 +/- 5.9 vs. 6.5 +/- 2.6; P = 0.015) and increased by 138% in comparison with gadopentetate dimeglumine (14.0 +/- 5.9 vs. 5.9 +/- 1.7; P = 0.034). Using BRU 52 (group B), CE increased by 60% in comparison with gadobenate dimeglumine (21.7 +/- 1.4 vs. 13.6 +/- 2.5; P = 0.013) and by 94% in comparison with gadopentetate dimeglumine (21.7 +/- 1.4 vs. 11.2 +/- 0.5; P < 0.0001). CNR using BRU 52 increased by 72% in comparison with gadobenate dimeglumine (21.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 12.3 +/- 3.1; P = 0.0002) and by 122% in comparison with gadopentetate dimeglumine (21.3 +/- 1.3 vs. 9.6 +/- 0.8; P < 0.0001).;The protein-binding capacity of gadolinium chelates shows a significant impact on CE and CNR in brain tumors with disrupted blood-brain barrier. In comparison with currently approved agents, high albumin-binding agents show further improved brain tumor CE. However, the time course of enhancement and optimal time frame for scanning after injection of agents with higher protein-binding capacities (approximately 50%-90%) has yet to be evaluated.",

The primary and recurrent tumors in Group A did not show structural alterations in the p16, p15 or CDK4 genes, whereas homozygous codeletion of p16 and p15 was observed in both primary and recurrent tumors in Group B. The primary tumors in Group C had a normal profile of p16, p15 and CDK4 at presentation. Upon recurrence, however, the tumors sustained either deletion of p16 alone or codeletion of both p16 and p15 or amplification of CDK4.

All patients were previously managed with radiotherapy 60 Gy total dose and chemotherapy with nitrosoureas and platinum compounds. At recurrence they were subdivided in homogeneous groups, all treated with the same systemic chemotherapy protocol: 27 GBL (group A) only systemically treated, 20 GBL (group B) treated also locally by delivering 4mg of mitoxantrone every 20 days through the Ommaya reservoire, and 25 GBL (group C) treated with a second surgery and locally as group B. Of the AA group, 13/27 were treated locally trough the Ommaya reservoir after repeat surgery. A trend to different demographic features among subgroups (with locoregionally treated patients and patients undergoing repeat surgery being younger than the others) was seen in this non-randomized study, but this was not statistically significant. Median overall survival was 27, 26 and 15.5 months respectively for groups c, b and a (log-rank = 0.1). After tumor recurrence median survival was 16.8, 12 and 6.6 months respectively for groups c, b and a (log-rank = 0.001) For the 29 AA, overall survival was 48.5 and 100 months (log-rank = 0.03) if treated locally with second tumor debulking. Our results stress the opinion that a second operation could be indicated only if it is a part of a therapeutic protocol to allow a locoregional treatment. Moreover we can finally assume that local delivery of chemotherapy after tumor recurrence, possibly extends patients survival but certainly improves the number of long-survivors.",

Oligoclonal IgG bands are rarely found in patients with LGI1-antibody encephalitis or epilepsy. These observations raise questions about the sources of the B cells that result in production of LGI1 antibodies and how the IgGs reach the brain. We aimed to investigate the migration and expansions of peripheral and central B cells to the production of LGI1-specific IgG.;We performed PCR amplification and next generation deep immune repertoire sequencing of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain variable regions (VH) from CSF and subsorted peripheral blood B-cell populations from two patients with limbic encephalitis and faciobrachial dystonic seizures associated with LGI1 antibodies. Bioinformatics clustering of related IgM-VH or IgG-VH transcripts was used to determine whether active B-cell diversification could be observed, and whether intrathecal B-cell repertoires, if present, were related to peripheral B cells.;We identified clusters of related Ig-VH transcripts in the CSF of both patients. Within these clusters there was a range of somatic hypermutations along the IGHV germline segment-derived portion. In addition, we identified a large number of closely related Ig-VH clusters that were common to both CSF and peripheral blood, including a small number of dominating Ig-VH clusters that might represent the most active clonally related B-cell populations.;Our data suggest that some B-cell affinity maturation occurs inside the CNS compartment in LGI1-antibody encephalitis. Somatic hypermutation rates point to a CSF antigen-driven activation of clonally related B cells that shape the intrathecal immune repertoire. The target antigen or antigens of these clonally related B cells remain unknown; our work continues to determine the relative contribution of intrathecally activated and peripheral LGI1-specific B cells in this autoimmune CNS disease.;Wellcome Trust Intermediate Fellowship to SRI, Fulbright-MS Society, Epilepsy Research UK, BMA Vera Down Research Grant.",

Gpnmb, which is highly expressed in glioblastoma cells, is a potential therapeutic target. However, little is known about its expression, cellular localization, and roles in non-tumorous neural tissues. In this study, we examined Gpnmb expression in the central nervous system of adult rats under both normal and inflammatory conditions. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that Gpnmb mRNA was expressed in the cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem, and spinal cord of normal adult rats. Immunoperoxidase staining revealed that Gpnmb-immunoreactive cells were widely distributed in the parenchyma of all brain regions examined, with the cells being most prevalent in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, cerebellar cortex, spinal dorsal horn, choroid plexus, ependyma, periventricular regions, and in layers II and III of the cerebral cortex. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that these cells were co-stained most frequently with the microglia/macrophage marker OX42, and occasionally with the radial glia marker RC2 or the neuronal marker NeuN. Furthermore, an intraperitoneal injection of bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide increased the number of Gpnmb and OX42 double-positive cells in the area postrema, which is one of the circumventricular organs, indicating infiltration of hematogenous macrophages. These results suggest that Gpnmb, which is expressed in microglia and macrophages in non-tumorous neural tissues, plays an important role in the regulation of immune/inflammatory responses.",

We studied a homogeneous series using the Sainte-Anne grading scale in order to better understanding the history of these tumors with or without treatment and to assess prognosis and associated factors.;A retrospective series of 318 adult patients with oligodendroglioma (OLG) treated at Hôpital Sainte-Anne, Paris (SA) and Hôpital Neurologique, Lyons (L) between 1984 and 2003 was analyzed: 182 grade A OLG (SA + L), 136 grade B among which a homogenous series of 98 (SA) were included. For grade A: age at diagnosis ranged from 21 to 70 (mean: 41), sex ratio was 1.28. For grade B: age at diagnosis ranged from 12 to 75 (mean: 45.5), sex-ratio was 1.58. The main first symptoms were: epilepsy (A: 91.5%; B: 76%), intracranial hypertension (A: 7.9%; B: 14.6%), neurological deficit (A: 5.1%; B: 17.7%). The most frequent locations were: frontal, insular and central for both A and B. Mean size was 55 mm for grade A, 62 mm for B. Calcifications were found in 20% of A, 48.5% of B. No tumor was enhanced on imaging (CT/MRI) in grade A, all but 7 in grade B. All patients underwent surgery either for biopsy (A: 47.2%; B: 53%), or removal which was partial (A: 26.4% vs B: 19.4%) or extended (A: 36.3% vs B: 37.8%). Fifty-six patients underwent 2 procedures and 12 three procedures. Radiotherapy was performed in 76.9% of grade A, and 91% of B patients, in the immediate postoperative period for 71% A and 82.7% B. Chemotherapy was delivered for 36% of grade A (in the event of transformation to grade B or failure of radiotherapy) and 67.5% of B patients. Among grade A tumors, 38% transformed into grade B within a mean delay of 51 months with a mean follow-up of 78 months.;Median survival was 136 months for grade A and 52 for grade B. Survival at 5, 10 and 15 was 75.5%, 51% and 22.4% for grade A vs 45.2%, 31.3% and 0% for grade B respectively. In univariate and multivariate analysis, grade A survival was associated with age at diagnosis, tumor size, large removal and response to radiotherapy. Grade B survival was associated with age at diagnosis, wide removal and sharply defined limits of the tumor on imaging.;Analysis of both published data and this series underlines many prognostic parameters. It shows that OLG are heterogeneous tumors even in each grade (A and B). Treatment should consequently progress towards more targeted procedures for patients mainly with postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy.",

Monolayer cells in exponential growth at various densities were quantified over a week by sulforhodamine B staining assay to produce cell-growth curves. A Gompertz equation was fitted to experimental data to obtain, for each cell line, three empirical growth parameters (initial cell density, cell-growth rate and carrying capacity - the maximal cell density). A cell-shape parameter named deformation coefficient D (a morphological relationship among spreading and confluent cells) was established and compared by regression analysis with the relative growth rate parameter K described by the Gompertz equation. We have found that coefficient D is directly proportional to the growth parameter K. The fit curve significantly matches the empirical data (P < 0.05), with a correlation coefficient of 0.9152. Therefore, a transformed Gompertzian growth function was obtained accordingly to D. The degree of correlation between the Gompertzian growth parameter and the coefficient D allows a new interpretation of the growth parameter K on the basis of morphological measurements of a set of tumour cell types, supporting the idea that cell-growth kinetics can be modulated by phenotypic organization of attached cells.",

The levels of hsp27 and alpha B crystallin, which were determined by specific immunoassays, were low in cells in confluent cultures. The levels of the two proteins increased after exposure of cells to heat (42 degrees C for 30 min) or arsenite (50 microM for 1 h). Cells exposed to 10 microM each of prostaglandin A1, A2, or J2 for 1 h resulted in stimulation of the binding to the heat shock element (HSE) of heat shock transcription factor (HSF). However, there was no phosphorylation-dependent mobility shift of HSF1 and no subsequent increase in the transcription and translation for hsp27, alpha B crystallin, and hsp70. When cells were exposed to arsenite in the presence of 10-40 microM prostaglandin, the accumulation of hsp27 and alpha B crystallin in cells was enhanced markedly. The levels of hsp70 also increased in cells that had been treated with arsenite in the presence of a prostaglandin, as estimated by Western blot analysis. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for hsp27, alpha B crystallin, and hsp70 was enhanced in cells that had been exposed to arsenite in the presence of each prostaglandin. Similar stimulatory effects of prostaglandins also were observed in the case of the heat-induced responses of hsp27, alpha B crystallin, and hsp70. Gel mobility shift assays revealed that each prostaglandin prolonged the arsenite-induced binding of HSF to HSE. These results suggest that the pharmacological dose of prostaglandins stimulates the stress-induced synthesis of stress proteins via activation of the HSF.",

We found that a small organic molecule, N-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] 5-methylisoxazole-4-carboxamide (SU101, leflunomide), inhibited PDGF-mediated signaling events, including receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. SU101 inhibited PDGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF receptor (PDGFR) beta in C6 (rat glioma) and NIH3T3 cells engineered to overexpress human PDGFRbeta (3T3-PDGFRbeta). SU101 blocked both PDGF- and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated DNA synthesis. Previously, this compound was shown to inhibit pyrimidine biosynthesis by interfering with the enzymatic activity of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. In the current study, EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis was restored by the addition of saturating quantities of uridine, whereas PDGF-induced DNA synthesis was not, suggesting that the compound demonstrated some selectivity for the PDGFR pathway that was independent of pyrimidine biosynthesis. Selectivity was further demonstrated by the ability of the compound to block the entry of PDGF-stimulated cells into the S phase of the cell cycle, without affecting cell cycle progression of EGF-stimulated cells. In cell growth assays, SU101 selectively inhibited the growth of PDGFRbeta-expressing cell lines more efficiently than it inhibited the growth of PDGFRbeta-negative cell lines. SU101 inhibited the s.c., i.p., and intracerebral growth of a panel of cell lines including cells from glioma, ovarian, and prostate origin. In contrast, SU101 failed to inhibit the in vitro or s.c. growth of A431 and KB tumor cells, both of which express EGF receptor but not PDGFRbeta. SU101 also inhibited the growth of D1B and L1210 (murine leukemia) cells in syngeneic immunocompetent mice, without causing adverse effects on the immune response of the animals. In an i.p. model of tumor growth in syngeneic immunocompetent mice, SU101 prevented tumor growth and induced long-term survivors in animals implanted with 7TD1 (murine B-cell hybridoma) tumor cells. Because PDGFRbeta was detected on most of the tumor cell lines in which in vivo growth was inhibited by SU101, these data suggest that SU101 is an effective inhibitor of PDGF-driven tumor growth in vivo.",

Whole cells were voltage or current clamped with the tight-seal recording technique. 2. Em was -76 and -80 mV in glial and glioma cells (mean values in U-787CG and U-251MG, respectively) in a reference external solution with 3.0 mM K+. K(+)-free external solution caused a rapid and reversible depolarization of these cells by about 26 and 42 mV (respectively). 3. Block of K+ channels with 1 mM Ba2+ in external solution rapidly depolarized the cells (U-251MG) by about 35 mV. 4. Na(+)-free solutions caused a delayed depolarization by 40-50 mV, which was slowly reversible (in 2 min). 5. Ouabain (1 mM) depolarized the cells by about 4 mV. It did not prevent the effect of K(+)-free solution. 6. Ca(2+)-free external solution rapidly depolarized the cells to Em about -17 mV. The combination of either Na(+)-K(+)-free or Na(+)-Ca(2+)-free solution transiently repolarized the cell, which indicated that the K+ selectivity of the membrane was decreased in both K(+)- and Ca(2+)-free solutions. 7. Metabolic inhibitors (carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone (FCCP) and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP)) rapidly and reversibly depolarized the cells. This effect was not prevented by intracellular perfusion of a strong Ca(2+)-buffering solution. 8. Voltage clamp revealed only minor changes (< 20%) in the leak conductance (g) of cells that were depolarized by the above-mentioned solutions. 9. Positive polarizing current elicited (in some cells) a regenerative depolarization. The threshold for depolarization was less in low external [K+]o. 10. It is concluded (a) that the resting potential of these glial cells depends on ion channels that are K+ selective only in the presence of external Ca2+ and K+ and (b) that this K+ selectivity may require that Em is near the reversal potential for potassium (EK), and (c) that the action of metabolic inhibitors (DNP and FCCP) is different from that in neurones.",

We have developed different liposomal formulations of gadolinium-DTPA (Magnevist®) for application in neutron capture therapy of glioblastoma. The formulations were characterized physicochemically and tested in vitro in a glioma cell model for their effectiveness.;Liposomes entrapping gadolinium-DTPA as neutron capture agent were manufactured via lipid/film-extrusion method and characterized with regard to size, entrapment efficiency and in vitro release. For neutron irradiation, F98 and LN229 glioma cells were incubated with the newly developed liposomes and subsequently irradiated at the thermal column of the TRIGA reactor in Mainz. The dose rate derived from neutron irradiation with (157)Gd as neutron capturing agent was calculated via Monte Carlo simulations and set in relation to the respective cell survival.;The liposomal Gd-DTPA reduced cell survival of F98 and LN229 cells significantly. Differences in liposomal composition of the formulations led to distinctly different outcome in cell survival. The amount of cellular Gd was not at all times proportional to cell survival, indicating that intracellular deposition of formulated Gd has a major influence on cell survival. The majority of the dose contribution arises from photon cross irradiation compared to a very small Gd-related dose.;Liposomal gadolinium formulations represent a promising approach for neutron capture therapy of glioblastoma cells. The liposome composition determines the uptake and the survival of cells following radiation, presumably due to different uptake pathways of liposomes and intracellular deposition of gadolinium-DTPA. Due to the small range of the Auger and conversion electrons produced in (157)Gd capture, the proximity of Gd-atoms to cellular DNA is a crucial factor for infliction of lethal damage. Furthermore, Gd-containing liposomes may be used as MRI contrast agents for diagnostic purposes and surveillance of tumor targeting, thus enabling a theranostic approach for tumor therapy.",

The enhancer activity has been localized to a 268-base pair (bp) fragment positioned approximately 4 kilobase pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site. This fragment contains two high affinity protein binding sites, regions A and B, as determined by DNase I protection assays using nuclear protein extracts from rat C6 glioma cells. Both sites include core sequence elements, TGAGTCA (region A) and TGTGTCA (region B), that resemble the consensus binding site, TGA(G/C)TCA, of the Jun/Fos (AP-1) family of transcription factors. Purified, bacterially expressed AP-1 (c-Jun homodimer) specifically binds to both elements, exhibiting greater affinity for the region A motif. The expression of pMHO4CAT, but not of pMHO1CAT, is stimulated by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and the 268-bp enhancer fragment confers TPA inducibility and c-Jun/c-Fos transactivation to the heterologous SV40 promoter.

The identification of genes associated with these phenotypes should further the molecular characterization, permitting better definition of glioma subsets that may ultimately lead to better treatment strategies. Therefore, we performed a differential mRNA display analysis comparing six GBM-derived primary cell cultures from patients having tumors with varied histomorphological features. We identified stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) as a gene with varied expression. SDF1 (cytokine) and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) interactions are implicated in modulating cell migration. They are also implicated in modulating the immune response in AIDS patients by macrophage-mediated T-cell apoptosis. GBM patients also fail to mount an immune response, although their tumors are seemingly exposed to immune cells in regions of angiogenesis, where the blood-brain barrier is absent, or in areas of necrosis. To determine whether the expression and localization of SDF1 and CXCR4 are consistent with such a role in these brain tumors, immunohistochemical analyses of these proteins were performed on normal brain and astrocytomas (grades II-IV). In normal brain tissue, low levels of SDF1 (0.5+) were observed in astrocytic processes, in neurons, and in the occasional phagocytic cells around vessels. CXCR4 expression was negative in brain tissue but was observed in phagocytic cells within the vessel lumen. In tumors, SDF1 and CXCR4 expression was colocalized when both were expressed, and SDF1 and CXCR4 expression increased with increasing tumor grade (from 0.5+ to 6+). Additionally, CXCR4 was expressed in neovessel endothelial cells. The proteins were expressed in regions of angiogenesis and degenerative, necrotic, and microcystic changes. Those tumors displaying greater amounts of these features had greater staining intensity of the proteins. The expression of SDF1 and CXCR4 did not colocalize with the proliferation marker MIB-1. Thus, our data suggest that SDF1 and CXCR4 expressions: (a) increase with increasing grade; (b) colocalize to regions within these tumors where their interaction may contribute to angiogenesis and/or modulation of the immune response; and (c) may serve to characterize subsets of GBMs.",

The effect of guggulipid and nimesulide on LPS-induced neuroinflammatory changes is also not properly understood. This work demonstrated the mechanism of actions of guggulipid and nimesulide on inflammatory genes expressions in LPS-stimulated rat astrocytoma cells, C6. We observed that LPS (10 μg/ml) treatment of rat astrocytoma cells, C6, for 24 h significantly increased intracellular Ca(2+) ion and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB), C/EBP homologous protein 10 (CHOP), c-fos, and c-jun proteins. At transcriptional stage, LPS upregulated mRNA levels of cyclooxygenase-2 and IL-6 with downregulation in IL-1α, IL-1β, and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) through activating NF-kB translocation. Treatment with guggulipid reversed these LPS-induced changes in rat astrocytoma cells. Treatment with nimesulide also attenuated LPS-induced Ca(2+) ion, iNOS, NF-kB, and c-fos expressions, but does not significantly influence CHOP, c-jun protein expressions, and mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-1α, IL-1β, and mPGES-1 genes. In conclusion, our findings elucidated the molecular mechanism of neuroinflammation in response to LPS and its modulation by guggulipid and nimesulide in rat astrocytoma cells (C6), which suggest the use of these drugs in the treatment of neuroinflammation-associated disorders.",

In this study, we analyzed processed HNRPK pseudogenes (HNRPK psi1-psi4) and coding sequences. HNRPK pseudogenes are apparently nonfunctional, and psi1 might correspond to transcripts from an ancestral gene. Phylogenetic and sequence analyses suggest that HNRP genes arose by duplication, and that new structural and sequence features expanded the functions of hnRNPs. The expression analysis of hnRNP K isoforms showed that isoform a is expressed in normal testis and in non-small cell lung cancer (NCI-H1155 NSCLC cell line), although the shorter isoform (isoform b) is expressed in different tumor cell lines (IM9 B-lymphoblastoid, Hs578T human breast cancer epithelial, T98G human glioma cell lines). Using molecular modeling, we obtained KH1 and KH3 models, which pointed to important residues for DNA-protein binding and no structural differences between isoforms a and b. To our knowledge, this is the first phylogenetic study including vertebrate HNRP genes and HNRPK pseudogenes, and the first report comparing the KH1 and KH3 domains of isoforms a and b of the hnRNP K protein.

In this report, we examined the role of AMOG expression on cell growth and intracellular signal transduction. We show that AMOG does not negatively regulate cell growth in vitro or in vivo. Instead, expression of AMOG in AMOG-deficient cells results in a dramatic increase in cell size associated with protein kinase B/Akt hyperactivation, which occurs independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation. AMOG-mediated Akt phosphorylation specifically activates the mTOR/p70S6 kinase pathway previously implicated in cell size regulation, but it does not depend on tuberous sclerosis complex/Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) signaling.

All PCNSLs lacked lymphatic vessels and, in this regard, were similar to 20 glioblastoma multiforme samples. In contrast to these tumors, all of which were located in the deep brain parenchyma, dural and meningeal DLBCL harbored lymphatic vessels that expressed Lyve-1 (3/8 tumors), podoplanin (5/8 tumors), and Prox-1 (5/8 tumors) in areas where the tumors had invaded the fibrous tissue of the dura.

Because IFNs have an antiproliferative effect, selection against the IFN alpha/beta system could play a role or accompany the development of the malignant phenotype. Although the deletion of the IFNA/B genes could interrupt an autocrine loop that controls cell proliferation, cells would still respond to exogenous IFN alpha/beta and, thus, lesions at the receptor or signal transduction level should also be present to render cells resistant to exogenous IFN alpha/beta. To test if selection against the IFN system was operating in acute leukemias, the sensitivity to the antiproliferative effect of IFN alpha 2 was studied in acute leukemia cell lines with and without alterations of the IFNA/B genes. We found that 10 of 11 acute leukemia cell lines with alterations of the IFNA/B genes were resistant to the antiproliferative effect of IFN alpha 2, whereas only two of eight cell lines with normal IFNA/B genes were IFN-resistant. We then examined the possibility that an alteration of the receptor expression could account for the lack of response to IFN alpha 2. No significant alteration in the expression or structure of the IFN alpha receptor was observed. We also studied the downmodulation of the alpha subunit of the IFN alpha receptor upon IFN alpha 2 binding. One cell line with deletion of the IFNA/B genes showed impaired downmodulation of the IFN alpha receptor.

Meta-analysis of the prognostic value of IL28RA genes in various cancers found that the expression of IL28RA was indeed related to the cancer prognosis in certain cancers. The STAT1 binding sites in the promoter region of IL28RA implied a specific mechanism for the amplifying effects of IFN-lambdas. The LyF-1 binding sites in the promoter region of IL28RA imply that IFN-lambdas were involved in the differentiation of early B and T cells.",

In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of applying a turbo-spin-echo (TSE)-based, three-dimensional (3D) APT sequence into routine clinical practice for patients with brain tumors.;Experiments were performed on a Philips 3-Tesla (3-T) MRI scanner using an eight-channel phased-array coil for reception. A fast 3D APT sequence with a TSE acquisition was proposed (saturation power, 2 μT; saturation time, 500 ms; 8 slices). The gradient echo (GRE)-based field-mapping technique or water-saturation-shift-referencing (WASSR) technique was used to acquire B(0) maps to correct for B(0)-induced artifacts in APT images. The test was performed on a box of homogenous protein solution, four healthy volunteers, and eight patients with high-grade gliomas.;The experimental data from a homogenous, protein-containing phantom and healthy volunteers show that the sequence produced a uniform contrast across all slices. The average MTR(asym)(3.5 ppm) values with GRE B(0)-corrected 3D APT imaging and WASSR-corrected 3D APT imaging were both comparable to the values obtained using the undemanding single-slice acquisition. The average APT image intensity was consistently higher in the tumor core than in the peripheral edema and in the contralateral normal-appearing white matter (both P < 0.001).;3D APT imaging of brain tumors can be performed in about 5 min at 3-T using a routine, commercial eight-channel SENSE coil.",

The tumors produced plasminogen activators and showed histological characteristics similar to those of the original tumor. Three groups of mice were studied. Group A received 5% epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA); Group B received 2.5% EACA; and Group C served as a control. There was no statistical difference among the three groups with regard to: 1) age at time of tumor transplantation; 2) the interval between implant and treatment; or 3) tumor volume at time of treatment. Blood measurements of EACA, performed in a limited number of animals, have shown that the drug at 5% concentration had reached toxic levels. Statistically significant differences between the three groups were noted in the following categories: 1) rate of tumor growth; 2) tumor volume at time of death, where Group A had smaller tumors than Group C; and 3) mean survival times of Groups A and B as compared to Group C. A statistically significant negative correlation was found between the rate of tumor growth and the length of survival of animals in Group C, while no correlation could be found for either Group A or B, indicating that the antifibrinolytic therapy modified this important biological variable.

ER subtypes have been identified in human astrocytomas, the most common and aggressive primary brain tumors. We studied the role of ER subtypes in cell growth of two human astrocytoma cell lines derived from tumors of different evolution grades: U373 and D54 (grades III and IV, respectively). E2 significantly increased the number of cells in both lines and the co-administration with an ER antagonist (ICI 182, 780) significantly blocked E2 effects. ERα was the predominant subtype in both cell lines. E2 and ICI 182, 780 down-regulated ERα expression. The number of U373 and D54 cells significantly increased after PPT (ERα agonist) treatment but not after DPN (ERβ agonist) one. To determine the role of SRC-1 and SRC-3 coactivators in ERα induced cell growth, we silenced them with RNA interference. Coactivator silencing blocked the increase in cell number induced by PPT. The content of proteins involved in proliferation and metastasis was also determined after PPT treatment. Western blot analysis showed that in U373 cells the content of PR isoforms (PR-A and PR-B), EGFR, VEGF and cyclin D1 increased after PPT treatment while in D54 cells only the content of EGFR was increased.

Of the ligands tested, substance P was the most potent in both cell lines: binding affinities were 0.1 nM for IM9 cells, and 0.3 nM for U373 MG cells, respectively. The high-affinity dipeptide antagonist, FK888, bound to NK1 receptors in both cell lines with similar potencies: Ki values were 1.2 nM and 3.6 nM for IM9 cells and U373 MG cells, respectively. Of the non-peptide antagonists, as expected, (+/-)-CP-96,345 displayed higher affinity (0.4 nM in IM9 cells, and 1.2 nM in U373 MG cells) than did RP 67580 (33 nM and 223 nM in IM9 cells and U373 MG cells, respectively) in both cell lines. We conclude that the pharmacological profile of NK1 receptors is similar in the human lymphoblastoma and astrocytoma cells, i.e. if NK1 receptor subtypes exist in humans, these cell lines are likely to express a similar subtype.

The observation in gliomas of platelet growth factor (PDGF)-like immunoreactivity fits with the autocrine secretion model, rising the possibility for the growth factor independence of the cancer cells. The discovery of the tumor suppressor genes, for which loss of function mutations are oncogenic as in the RB gene of the retinoblastoma and p53 gene, has introduced a new concept of oncogenesis which could be useful even in the cure of the neoplasms. Several oncogenes are amplified and/or expressed in brain tumors, some associated with polymorphism leading to abnormal protein products. Therefore, corresponding functions, such as production of deficient epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) encoded by erb-B, are impaired. Abnormal chromosomal patterns have been recognized in brain tumors and found mainly in chromosomes 7 and 22 on which oncogenes erb-B and sis are located, respectively. Location of proto-oncogenes, which are normally expressed in the brain, indicate that they share common distribution patterns mainly involving the cerebellum, hippocampus and olfactory bulbs. These proto-oncogenes may be regulated by physiological and pathological events. The concept of oncogene involvement in brain tumors must be extended to include the other factors such as G-proteins, growth factor receptors, membrane-associated and cytoplasmic protein kinases, which are all responsible for the control of the cell growth and their response to external signals including chemotherapeutic drigs.",

To assess the potential role of the angiotensins in brain tumor-associated vessels, the expression of the enzymes of the angiotensin cascade were evaluated in these tumors. The production of these bioactive peptides is dependent on the activities of exopeptidases, including several aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases, producing angiotensin (Ang) I, II, III, IV and Ang 1-7. Human cerebral parenchymal and glioblastoma cells expressed renin, and tumor vasculature, but not glioblastoma cells, expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme. High aminopeptidase A (APA) activity, but no aminopeptidase N/B activity, was observed in human brain tumor vasculature, suggesting a predominant production of Ang III. Grafting of rat glioma cells in rat brains yielded tumors with high APA and low aminopeptidase N/B activities in tumor vessels, confirming human results. Tumor growth and APA activity in tumor vessels were not affected by chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. The brain-derived EC219 endothelial cells expressed high APA activity, which was not involved in endothelial cell proliferation, but was down-regulated by exposure of cells to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) or to TGF beta-secreting tumor cells, suggesting a role for this peptide in the control of APA activity in cerebral vasculature. Thus, APA is a potential marker of chronic dysfunction, involving loss of TGF beta function, of the metabolic blood-brain barrier, but not of neovascularization.",

Thus, macrophage cell lines J774A.1 and P388D1, pulmonary artery endothelium cell line CPAE, rat glial tumor cell line C6, and human astrocytoma cell lines CCF-STTG1 and U-373 MG were infected with either log- or stationary-phase cells of N. asteroides GUH-2, and the host cell-nocardia interactions were determined by light microscopy and electron microscopy. Polyclonal antinocardial antibody did not enhance uptake of nocardiae by any of these cell lines; however, log-phase cells of GUH-2 infected a higher percentage of J774A.1 and P388D1 than did stationary-phase organisms. When cells infected with stationary-phase GUH-2 were incubated for 6 h, filaments developed, which indicated that nocardial growth had occurred. In J774A.1 and P388D1, only 31 to 57% of the total stationary-phase coccobacillary cells that were phagocytized formed filaments within 6 h. This indicated that there was some inhibition of growth of the phagocytized nocardiae within these macrophage cell lines; however, the nocardiae grew within the endothelial (> 87% filaments) and astrocytoma (100% filaments) cell lines. Microfilament inhibitor cytochalasin B inhibited uptake of GUH-2 by macrophages and other cell lines, except that there was no effect on uptake of nocardial cells by astrocytoma cell line U-373 MG. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed phagocytosis of GUH-2 by the different cell lines. In cytochalasin B-treated cells, nocardiae were shown to penetrate through the cell surface and become internalized in a manner distinct from typical phagocytosis, suggesting that filamentous forms of this organism have a phagocytosis-independent invasion factor. The extent of this cytochalasin-resistant cellular penetration by the nocardiae differed in the different cell lines.",

The use of retroviral tagging as a means of identifying cancer-causing genes has, however, almost entirely been restricted to hematopoietic tumors. The aim of this study was to develop a system allowing for the retroviral tagging of candidate genes in malignant brain tumors. Mouse gliomas were induced by a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus encoding platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain. The underlying idea was that tumors evolve through a combination of PDGF-mediated autocrine growth stimulation and insertional mutagenesis of genes that cooperate with PDGF in gliomagenesis. Common insertion sites (loci that were tagged in more than one tumor) were identified by cloning and sequencing retroviral flanking segments, followed by blast searches of mouse genome databases. A number of candidate brain tumor loci (Btls) were identified. Several of these Btls correspond to known tumor-causing genes; these findings strongly support the underlying idea of our experimental approach. Other Btls harbor genes with a hitherto unproven role in transformation or oncogenesis. Our findings indicate that retroviral tagging with a growth factor-encoding virus may be a powerful means of identifying candidate tumor-causing genes in nonhematopoietic tumors.",

Although IL-1beta-induced Cox-2 expression most likely requires activation of nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NFkappaB) pathway, this has never been formally demonstrated in vivo. We tested this using a specific inhibitor of NFkappaB activation, the NEMO binding domain (NBD) peptide, that has been shown previously to be effective in various in vivo models of acute inflammation. Incubation of rat glioma cells with the NBD peptide blocked IL-1beta-induced NFkappaB nuclear translocation. Furthermore, after injection of a biotinylated version of the NBD peptide into the lateral ventricle of the brain, we found that it readily diffused to its potential cellular targets in vivo. To test the effects of the peptide on NFkappaB activation and Cox-2 expression in the brain, we injected it intracerebroventricularly (36 microg/rat) into rats before intraperitoneal injection of IL-1beta (60 microg/kg). Treatment with NBD peptide completely abolished IL-1beta-induced NFkappaB activation and Cox-2 synthesis in microvasculature. In contrast, the peptide had no effect on constitutive neuronal Cox-2. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that IL-1beta-induced NFkappaB activation plays a major role in transmission of immune signals from the periphery to the brain.",

However, the mechanisms underlying the tumorigenic role of GLI2 remain elusive. We demonstrate that overexpression of GLI2-β isoform, which lacks the N-terminal repressor domain (GLI2ΔN) in human keratinocytes is sufficient to induce numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations, including tetraploidy/aneuploidy and chromosomal translocations. This is coupled with suppression of cell cycle regulators p21(WAF1/CIP1) and 14-3-3σ, and strong induction of anti-apoptotic signalling, resulting in a reduction in the ability to eliminate genomically abnormal cells. Overexpression of GLI2ΔN also rendered human keratinocytes resistant to UVB-mediated apoptosis, whereas inhibition of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) restored endogenous (genomic instability (GIN)) and exogenous (UVB) DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Thus, we propose that ectopic expression of GLI2 profoundly affects the genomic integrity of human epithelial cells and contributes to the survival of progenies with genomic alterations by deregulating cell cycle proteins and disabling the apoptotic mechanisms responsible for their elimination. This study reveals a novel role for GLI2 in promoting GIN, a hallmark of human tumors, and identifies potential mechanisms that may provide new opportunities for the design of novel forms of cancer therapeutic strategies.

Experiments with a monoclonal antibody to tubulin show that preservation of tubulin is very sensitive to the preparatory procedures used. Maximum labeling of tubulin in intact cells was obtained when the cells were pre-fixed with formaldehyde before permeabilization with solvent. Maximum labeling of tubulin in Triton-extracted cytoskeletons was achieved by pre-fixing the cells with the bifunctional protein crosslinking reagent dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate), extracting with Triton in a microtubule-stabilizing buffer, and post-fixing with formaldehyde.

This increase in activity is associated with a rapid (within minutes) redistribution of transporter from a subcellular compartment to the plasma membrane and is blocked by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Similar effects of PI3K inhibitors have been observed for insulin-dependent up-regulation of the GLUT4 subtype of glucose transporter. Although GLUT4 regulation also depends on the serine-threonine kinase (Akt/protein kinase B), a downstream target of PI3K, the downstream effectors responsible of PDGF-dependent regulation of EAAC1 have not been identified. In the present study, PDGF increased the level of Akt phosphorylation (Ser 473) in C6 glioma cells, a cell line that has been used to study regulated trafficking of endogenous EAAC1. Two inhibitors of PI3K blocked this effect. In transient transfection studies, a dominant negative mutant of Akt-1 blocked PDGF-induced redistribution of epitope-tagged EAAC1 (myc-EAAC1). Conversely, constitutively active Akt-1 (CA Akt-1) increased the cell surface expression of myc-EAAC1. A lentiviral vector engineered to express CA Akt-1 increased Akt activation, cell surface expression of endogenous EAAC1, and Na(+)-dependent glutamate transport activity. Together, these studies suggest that Akt is required for PDGF-induced regulation of EAAC1.",

In the same slides, neither class I nor class II MHC antigen was detected in neural cells or most tumor cells.

On a human glioblastoma cell line (GaMg) and rat glioma cell line (BT5C) a slight but significant stimulatory effect was found, while human mammary carcinoma cells (MCF7) were not affected. On SC1 mouse lymphoma cells a slight stimulation of cell growth was seen during the first part of exponential growth. Since HP5b acts as a stimulator for stromal cell secretion of other growth factors, supernatants from a human bone marrow stromal cell line stimulated with HP5b were tested on various cell lines. The effects of the supernatants on cell growth of the tested cell lines were not affected by HP5b treatment. Taken together with available in vivo data, the results indicate that the hemoregulatory peptide is a selective stimulator of myelopoiesis.",

These peptides, as well as two of their analogues Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu-Glu (91-96) and Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu (91-95), have now been synthesized and characterized. Their opioid activity was examined by three different bioassays: (a) displacement of D-2-alanyl[tyrosyl-3,5-3H]enkephalin-(5-L-methioninamide) and [3H]dihydromorphine from rat brain membranes; (b) naloxone-reversible inhibition of adenylate cyclase in homogenates of neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells; (c) naloxone-reversible inhibition of electrically stimulated contractions of the mouse vas deferens. The synthetic peptide of sequence 90-96 was the most potent opioid in all three bioassays and its potency was similar to that of the isolated alpha-casein exorphins. The synthetic peptides were totally resistant to hydrolysis by trypsin and homogenates of rat brain membranes, but were partially inactivated by chymotrypsin and subtilisin. The difference in opioid activity of alpha-casein exorphins may be related to differences in conformational flexibility observed by NMR spectroscopy.",

As a conjugating enzyme, it directs polyubiquitination to preferred lysine in the substrates. In addition to its well-known role in cyclin B destruction that is essential for exit from mitosis, UBE2C also plays an important role in mitotic spindle checkpoint control. Cells overexpressing UBE2C ignore the mitotic spindle checkpoint signals and lose genomic stability, which is a hallmark of cancer. UBE2C expression is upregulated upon malignant transformation, and amplification of UBE2C is often seen at the chromosome level in cancers in a manner similar to c-Myc, which is directly upstream of UBE2C. UBE2C levels are upregulated in a wide range of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. The level of expression correlates with the aggressiveness of the tumor. High UBE2C expression is predictive of poor survival and perhaps high risk for relapse. UBE2C immunochemistry may be integrated into the diagnosis of thyroid malignancy and gliomas.

This report presents the synthesis and biological evaluation of (64)Cu-labeled 2-(diphenylphosphoryl)ethyldiphenylphosphonium (TPEP) cations as novel PET radiotracers for tumor imaging. Biodistribution studies were performed using the athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous U87MG human glioma xenografts to explore the impact of linkers, bifunctional chelators (BFCs), and chelates on biodistribution characteristics of the (64)Cu-labeled TPEP cations. Metabolism studies were carried out using normal athymic nude mice to determine the metabolic stability of four (64)Cu radiotracers. It was found that most (64)Cu radiotracers described in this study have significant advantages over (99m)Tc-Sestamibi for their high tumor/heart and tumor/muscle ratios. Both BFCs and linkers have significant impact on biological properties of (64)Cu-labeled TPEP cations. For example, (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPEP) has much lower liver uptake and better tumor/liver ratios than (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPP), suggesting that TPEP is a better mitochondrion-targeting molecule than TPP. Replacing DO3A with DO2A results in (64)Cu(DO2A-xy-TPEP) (+), which has a lower tumor uptake than (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPEP). Substitution of DO3A with NOTA-Bn leads to a significant decrease in tumor uptake for (64)Cu(NOTA-Bn-xy-TPEP). The use of DOTA-Bn to replace DO3A has little impact on the tumor uptake, but the tumor/liver ratio of (64)Cu(DOTA-Bn-xy-TPEP) (-) is not as good as that of (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPEP), probably due to the aromatic benzene ring in DOTA-Bn. Addition of an extra acetamido group in (64)Cu(DOTA-xy-TPEP) results in a lower liver uptake, but tumor/liver ratios of (64)Cu(DOTA-xy-TPEP) and (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPEP) are comparable due to a faster tumor washout of (64)Cu(DOTA-xy-TPEP). Substitution of xylene with the PEG 2 linker also leads to a significant reduction in both tumor and liver uptake. MicroPET imaging studies on (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPEP) in athymic nude mice bearing U87MG glioma xenografts showed that the tumor was clearly visualized as early as 1 h postinjection with very high T/B contrast. There was very little metabolite (<2%) detectable in the urine and feces samples for (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPEP), (64)Cu(DOTA-Bn-xy-TPEP)(-), and (64)Cu(NOTA-Bn-xy-TPEP). Considering both tumor uptake and T/B ratios (particularly tumor/heart, tumor/liver, and tumor/muscle), it was concluded that (64)Cu(DO3A-xy-TPEP) is a promising PET radiotracer for imaging the MDR-negative tumors.",

By using this approach, the oocytes acquire human GABAA receptors, and we have shown previously that the \"epileptic receptors\" (receptors transplanted from epileptic brains) display a marked run-down during repetitive applications of GABA. It was found that exposure to the neurotrophin BDNF increased the amplitude of the \"GABA currents\" (currents elicited by GABA) generated by the epileptic receptors and decreased their run-down; both events being blocked by K252A, a neurotrophin tyrosine kinase receptor B inhibitor. These effects of BDNF were not mimicked by nerve growth factor. In contrast, the GABAA receptors transplanted from the nonepileptic human hippocampal uncus (obtained during surgical resection as part of the nontumoral tissue from the oligodendroglioma margins) or receptors expressed by injecting rat recombinant alpha1beta2gamma2 GABAA receptor subunit cDNAs generated GABA currents whose time-course and run-down were not altered by BDNF. Loading the oocytes with the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetate-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), or treating them with Rp-8-Br-cAMP, an inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent PKA, did not alter the GABA currents. However, staurosporine (a broad spectrum PK inhibitor), bisindolylmaleimide I (a PKC inhibitor), and U73122 (a phospholipase C inhibitor) blocked the BDNF-induced effects on the epileptic GABA currents. Our results indicate that BDNF potentiates the epileptic GABAA currents and antagonizes their use-dependent run-down, thus strengthening GABAergic inhibition, probably by means of activation of tyrosine kinase receptor B receptors and of both PLC and PKC.",

Eighteen of the 37 ovarian neoplasms, 4 of the 10 thyroid neoplasms, and 14 of 28 mid-gut carcinoid tumors expressed strong and distinct endothelial staining, whereas staining results of the remaining tumors were negative.

Another interesting feature of gp200 is that it is immunologically highly related to the EGF receptor (polypeptide mass of 135 kDa), a member of the erb-B family of proteins; however, it lacks EGF binding activity. gp200 also differs from all other EGF-receptor-related oncogenic proteins, namely erb-B-2, erb-B-3 and erb-B-4 gene products, and hence appears to be yet another member of the erb-B family of proteins. This is further strengthened by the fact that both gp200 and the EGF receptor are also recognized by a conformation-specific anti-peptide antibody to the cytoplasmic domain of the beta-type PDGF receptor. In the EGF- and the PDGF receptors, this peptide epitope is cryptic and receptor phosphorylation unmasks this site [Panneerselvam K, Reitz H, Khan S A, and Bishayee S (1995) J Biol Chem 270, 7975-7979] indicating that this epitope might be important in biological message transmission.

The purpose of the present research was to employ pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-induced secretion of immunoglobulin (Ig) by peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to further investigate impaired lymphocyte function in these patients. The PWM response of PBL from normal individuals averaged 8384 plaque-forming cells (PFC) per 10(6) cells, whereas the response of PBL from patients averaged 1590 PFC/10(6). The decreased PWM response of PBL patients could not be improved by varying the number of PBL placed in culture or employing different concentrations of PWM. Co-culture experiments to detect the presence of suppressor cells in PBL and purified T cell preparations from patients demonstrated that enhanced suppressor cell activity was not evident. Next, experiments were performed to assess the T-helper cell activity present in purified T cell preparations obtained from patients. The results demonstrated that T cells from patients lacked the ability to provide adequate helper activity in the PWM response. Moreover, studies with monoclonal antibodies directed against T cell subsets revealed that PBL from patients have a reduced percentage of T-helper cells (40%) as compared with normal values (55%). In concert with T-helper cell anomalies, B cell function in these patients also is diminished. Thus, these observations indicate that a combined T-helper and B cell defect may contribute to the broad impairment of host immunocompetence observed in patients with primary gliomas.",

The present study used peripheral microdialysis: (a) to determine whether amitriptyline could enhance extracellular tissue levels of endogenous adenosine in the rat hindpaw and (b) to examine mechanisms by which such an increase could occur. Local injection of amitriptyline into the plantar hindpaw, at doses that produce peripheral antinociception (100-300 nmol), produced an increase in local extracellular levels of adenosine. When injected in combination with formalin, which also enhances such levels of adenosine, an additive increase was observed. This adenosine originated partly as nucleotide, as inhibition of ecto-5'-nucleotidase reduced the amount of adenosine detected in the probe following administration of amitriptyline. When administered in combination with exogenous adenosine, amitriptyline augmented recovery of adenosine in the probe. Pretreatment of rats with capsaicin augmented the ability of amitriptyline to increase adenosine levels detected in the dialysis probe; it also enhanced tissue recovery of exogenously administered adenosine. In uptake studies using cultured rat C6 glioma cells, amitriptyline inhibited adenosine uptake by an adenosine transporter (IC50 0.37 +/- 0.12 mM). In enzyme assays, amitriptyline had no effect on adenosine kinase or adenosine deaminase activity. These results demonstrate that amitriptyline: (a) enhances extracellular tissue levels of adenosine in the rat hindpaw following local administration in vivo and (b) inhibits adenosine uptake but has no effect on metabolism in vitro. Therefore, increased extracellular adenosine levels in vivo appear to result partially from extracellular conversion of nucleotide and partially from inhibition of uptake.",

The inflammatory mediator bradykinin (1 microM) was studied and found to induce a fall in TEER; the link between this change and intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) was then examined. 1 microM bradykinin produced a peak-plateau increase in [Ca(2+)](i). The peak showed desensitization and was dose dependent (over 0.1 nM to 1 microM). The [Ca(2+)](i) increase was blocked by the B(2) antagonist HOE 140 (1 microM) without effect from a B(1) agonist and antagonist. The plateau response was abolished in Ca(2+)-free solution containing 2 mM EDTA, and also by the Ca(2+) channel blockers lanthanum, La(3+) (10 microM), and SKF 96365 (100 microM). The store Ca(2+)ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (1 microM) abolished the peak response. The putative phospholipase C inhibitors, U73122 (20 microM) and ETH-18-OCH(3) (100 microM), unexpectedly increased [Ca(2+)](i); after their application, bradykinin was ineffective. Agents without effect on Ca(2+) responses to bradykinin included the phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) inhibitor aristolochic acid (0.5 mM), cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (100 microM), 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid, NDGA (100 microM), calphostin C (0.5 microM), L-NAME (1 mM) and nifedipine (10 microM). The fall in TEER from bradykinin was blocked by HOE 140, U73122 and thapsigargin combined with La(3+), and also by aristolochic acid and NDGA, but not indomethacin, calphostin C or L-NAME. U73122 increased TEER while ETH-18-OCH(3) reduced it. Thus bradykinin reduced TEER through B(2) receptor-linked release of Ca(2+) from thapsigargin-sensitive stores, leading to activation of PLA(2) and metabolism of arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase.",

New developments in optical techniques offer non-invasive high-resolution imaging that may integrate well into the workflow of neurosurgical operations. Using an intracranial glioma model, we have recently shown that time domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows discrimination of normal brain, diffusely invaded brain tissue, and solid tumor. OCT imaging allowed acquisition of 2D and 3D data arrays for multiplanar analysis of the tumor to brain interface. In this study we have analyzed biopsy specimens of human brain tumors and we present the first feasibility study of intraoperative OCT and post-image acquisition processing for non-invasive imaging of the brain and brain tumor.;We used a Sirius 713 Tomograph with a superluminescence diode emitting light at a near infrared central wavelength of 1,310 nm and a coherence length of 15 microm. The light is passed through an optical mono mode fiber to a modified OCT adapter containing a lens system with a working distance of 10 cm and an integrated pilot laser. Navigation-registered tumor biopsies were imaged ex vivo and the intraoperative site of optical tissue analysis was registered by marker acquisition using a neuronavigation system.;Optical coherence tomography non-contact measurements of brain and brain tumor tissue produced B-scan images of 4 mm in width and 1.5-2.0 mm in depth at an axial and lateral optical resolution of 15 microm. OCT imaging demonstrated a different microstructure and characteristic signal attenuation profiles of tumor versus normal brain. Post-image acquisition processing and automated detection of the tissue to air interface was used to realign A-scans to compensate for image distortions caused by pulse- and respiration-induced movements of the target volume. Realigned images allowed monitoring of intensity changes within the scan line and facilitated selection of areas for the averaging of A-scans and the calculation of attenuation coefficients for specific regions of interest.;This feasibility study has demonstrated that OCT analysis of the tissue microstructure and light attenuation characteristics discriminate normal brain, areas of tumor infiltrated brain, solid tumor, and necrosis. The working distance of the OCT adapter and the A-scan acquisition rate conceptually allows integration of the OCT applicator into the optical path of the operating microscopes. This would allow a continuous analysis of the resection plain, providing optical tomography, thereby adding a third dimension to the microscopic view and information on the light attenuation characteristics of the tissue.",

In the series of 241 cases (107 male, 134 female patients, median age -- 38 years, (16-73)) we analyzed the impact of histology, tumor grade and genetic alterations on time to tumor progression (TTP). All patients underwent surgical resection of tumor or biopsy from 2000 to 2005. 70 patterns (oligodendroglioma (O) -- 13 cases, oligoastrocytoma (OA) -- 13, anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO) -- 30, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (AOA) -- 14) were assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization.

Deletion 1p19q was noted in 34 (49%) cases. In pure O codeletion 1p19q was detected more frequently (in O -- 75%, in AO -- 56%) than in mixed tumors (in OA -- 31%, in AOA -- 35%). Deletions 9p, 10q and EGFR amplification were noted in 5, 6 and 4 cases, respectively. None of the tumors with 1pl9q deletion had other genetic alterations.

Median TTP in groups A, B and C was 46.6, 25.3 and 6.4 months, respectively (p < 0.001). The percentage of OT with 1p19q codeletion was lower than in previous studies.

Predicting the ligand selectivity of the cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors in the absence of generally accepted models for their structures requires a ligand-based approach, which makes such studies ideally suited for quantum-chemical treatments. We present a QSAR model for ligand-receptor interactions based on quantum-chemical descriptors (an eQSAR) obtained from PM3 semi-empirical calculations for a series of phenyl-substituted cannabinoids based on a ligand with known in vivo activity against glioma [Duntsch, C.; Divi, M.

A good model for CB(2) inhibition (R(2)=0.78) has been developed requiring only four explanatory variables derived from semi-empirical results. The role of the ligand dipole moment is discussed and we propose that the CB(2) binding pocket likely possesses a significant electric field.

        "Doc_abstract":"BACKGROUND: Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) have been proposed as a new therapy for patients with cancer, including malignant brain tumors. Antisense ODNs are taken up by tumor cells and selectively block gene expression. Use of ODNs for brain tumors is attractive due to their theoretical specificity, relative ease of production and, to date, paucity of reported adverse effects. This article presents current information regarding antisense ODNs and their possible future use for the treatment of brain tumors. METHODS: The available published experimental and clinical information regarding antisense ODN treatment of glioblastoma cells and administration into the central nervous system (CNS) was reviewed. Other clinically relevant information pertaining to the molecular biology of antisense ODNs was also collected and summarized. RESULTS: Targets for antisense ODN therapy in malignant glioma cells have included c-myc, c-myb, c-sis, c-erb B, CD44, p34cdc2, bFGF, PDGF, TGF-beta, IGF-1, PKC-alpha tumor necrosis factor, urokinase, and S100beta protein. Few in vivo studies of ODN treatment of brain tumors have yet been reported. Systemically administered ODNs enter the brain only in extremely small quantities; therefore, microinfusion into the brain has been recommended. CONCLUSIONS: Antisense ODNs have been used successfully to block glioblastoma gene expression in vitro and expression of multiple genes within the CNS of experimental animals. Upcoming clinical trials will address the safety of antisense ODN use against malignant brain tumors.",

A 1.5-kbp fragment containing the rat D2R promoter was cloned upstream of the reporter and transfected into D2R-expressing NB2A cells or nonexpressing NG108-15 and C6 glioma cells. MEKK and CaMKII, but not CaMKIV and PKA, increased promoter activity 4.5- and 1.5-fold, respectively, in NB2A cells. Inhibitory effects of a MEK inhibitor and lack of effect by dominant negative (DN)-JNK1 or DN-p38MAPK revealed that ERK but not JNK and p38MAPK is involved in MEKK-induced promoter activation. Deletion and mutation of the promoter revealed that the MEKK-responsive region was Sp1 site B between nucleotides -56 and -47. Overexpression of Sp1 suppressed promoter activity without affecting MEKK-induced activation. Interestingly, overexpression of Zif268 increased promoter activity through the region between nucleotides -56 and -36. Increased activity by Zif268 was additive with CaMKII-induced activation but not with activation induced by MEKK. Co-transfection with CaMKII stimulated nuclear translocation of Zif268. These results suggest that ERK and CaMKII positively regulate the D2R promoter and that Zif268 is a potential transcription factor for the CaMKII-dependent pathway.",

Testing of numerous tumor cell lines and tumor tissue sections showed that Me14/D12-defined Ag was present not only on melanoma but also on other tumor lines of neuroectodermal origin such as gliomas and neuroblastomas and on some lymphoblastic B cell lines, on monocytes and macrophages. Immunoprecipitation by mAb Me14/D12 of lysates from [35S]methionine-labeled melanoma cells analyzed by SDS-PAGE revealed two polypeptide chains of 33 and 38 KDa, both under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Cross-linking experiments indicated that the two chains were present at the cell surface as a dimeric structure. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that the two chains of 33 and 38 KDa had isoelectric points of 6.2 and 5.7, respectively. Treatment of the melanoma cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, resulted in a reduction of the Mr from 33 to 24 KDa and from 38 to 26 KDa. Peptide maps obtained after Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion showed no shared peptides between the two chains. Although biochemical data indicate that Me14/D12 molecules do not correspond to any known MHC class II Ag, their dimeric structure, tissue distribution, and regulation of IFN-gamma suggest that they could represent a new member of the MHC class II family.",

Increased dose intensity has been correlated with response rate and survival in many solid tumors.;Ten children with recurrent or newly diagnosed brain tumors were treated with four sequential courses of high-dose single agent chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) support. PBSC harvesting was undertaken prior to chemotherapy and following the first course of chemotherapy (3.6 g/m2 etoposide). Each course of chemotherapy consisted of a single drug followed 48 hours later by PBSC reinfusion. Three patients were treated on Regimen A: etoposide, carboplatinum 1.95 g/m2, cyclophosphamide 5 g/m2, and thiotepa 300 mg/m2; three patients were treated on Regimen A' with carmustine 600 mg/m2 replacing cyclophosphamide; four patients received Regimen B: etoposide, carboplatinum 1.95g/m2, cyclophosphamide 7 g/m2, and thiotepa 900 mg/m2.;No course of chemotherapy was complicated by >14 days of neutropenia. Platelet recovery was more prolonged, particularly in patients who had previously received craniospinal irradiation. Non-hematologic toxicity was severe with three toxic deaths including two patients who developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome and respiratory failure. Two of three patients with primitive neuroectodermal tumors had a partial response; no responses were observed in patients with high-grade gliomas.;Administration of multiple courses of high-dose chemotherapy with PBSC support is feasible in this patient population and successfully mitigates hematologic toxicity.

In this study, the human glioblastoma cell lines SHG-44 and U251 were stably transfected with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting cyclin D1 or with ectogenic cyclin D1 by lentivirus-mediated transfection. Glioblastoma cells overexpressing or underexpressing cyclin D1 were then examined by in vitro growth assays, apoptosis assays, cell cycle analysis, and invasion assays. Cyclin D1 knockdown in SHG-44 cells inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and attenuated migration across Matrigel, a model of invasive capacity. Western blot analysis and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that cells underexpressing CCND1 exhibited decreased multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) expression, but enhanced apoptosis effector caspase-3 expression. In contrast, cyclin D1 overexpression promoted cell proliferation, attenuated apoptosis, and enhanced invasive capacity. Furthermore, cyclin D1 overexpression was associated with increased expression of MDR1 and Bcl-2, and decreased caspase-3 expression. Results using the U251 cell line confirmed the effects of CCND1-targeted shRNA and lentivirus-mediated overexpression on proliferation and apoptosis of glioblastoma cells. Overexpression of cyclin D1 enhanced the proliferation and invasive potential of human glioblastoma cells, while reducing apoptosis. The ability to suppress the malignant phenotype by downregulating cyclin D1 expression may provide a new gene therapy approach for patients with malignant glioma.",

DWI was performed on a 1.5 T unit using a single-shot echo-planar spin-echo pulse sequence with b 1,000 s/mm2. The signal intensity of the cystic or necrotic portion on DWI was classified by visual assessment as markedly low (as low as cerebrospinal fluid), slightly lower than, isointense with, and slightly or markedly higher than normal brain parenchyma. ADC were calculated in 31 lesions using a linear estimation method with measurements from b of 0 and 1,000 s/ mm2.

Patient A is a girl treated for anaplastic astrocytoma at 10 years and for multiple melanomas on the scalp associated to dysplastic nevi two years later. Her monozygotic twin sister carried dysplastic nevi and a slow growing, untreated cerebral lesion. Direct sequencing analysis showed no alterations in melanoma susceptibility genes including CDKN2A, CDK4, MC1R and MITF or in TP53. By microsatellite analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and array comparative genomic hybridization a deletion including the CDKN2A, CDKN2B and CDKN2BAS gene cluster was detected in both twin sisters, encompassing a large region at 9p21.3 and occurring de novo after the loss of one paternal allele.Patient B is a boy of 7 years when treated for astrocytoma then developing melanoma associated to congenital nevi on the head 10 years later: sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification revealed a normal profile of the CDKN2A/CDKN2B/CDKN2BAS region. Array comparative genomic hybridization confirmed the absence of deletions at 9p21.3 and failed to reveal known pathogenic copy number variations.;By comparison with the other germ line deletions at the CDKN2A, CDKN2B and CDKN2BAS gene cluster reported in melanoma susceptible families, the deletion detected in the two sisters is peculiar for its de novo origin and for its extension, as it represents the largest constitutive deletion at 9p21.3 region identified so far.In addition, the two studied cases add to other evidence indicating association of melanoma with exposure to ionizing radiation and with second neoplasm after childhood cancer.

They were analysed by immunohistochemistry for Akt/PKB expression as well as p53 protein accumulation, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression, and MIB-1 labeling index. The prognostic significance of each molecular covariate was tested by multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazard model including age, performance status, and extent of surgical resection.;Akt/PKB overexpression significantly correlated with both shorter overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) (p = 0.0110). All the Akt/PKB-positive patients with post-operative residual tumours experienced tumour recurrences, whereas only a small fraction of the Akt/PKB-negative individuals had recurrences (p = 0.0070). Invasive recurrence into surrounding brain occurred only in the Akt/PKB-overexpressed tumours. In contrast, MIB-1 labeling index correlated only with OS, while p53 protein accumulation correlated only with PFS. The Cox's proportional hazard model identified Akt/PKB overexpression as a significant prognostic factor for shorter PFS (p = 0.0117).;These results show that Akt/PKB overexpression would be suggestive of malignant progression and invasive regrowth of diffuse astrocytoma, and it can serve as a novel prognostic marker for this tumour.",

However, the optimal timing and the precise mechanisms responsible are not known. The effect of different time intervals between glucose load and thermochemotherapy with ACNU in the treatment of BT4An tumors, therefore, was investigated. Changes of serum glucose (Se-glucose), hemoglobin, systemic circulation parameters, tumor pH, and tumor temperature, induced by intraperitoneal glucose and/or hyperthermia, were measured to assess their effect on tumor growth.;(a): Inbred BD IX rats with BT4An tumors on the hind leg were treated with ACNU 7 mg/kg intravenously just before waterbath hyperthermia, and intraperitoneal hypertonic glucose (6 g/kg) at different time intervals before (240-0 min) or immediately after thermochemotherapy. (b): Intratumoral pH and temperature were measured at different intervals after intraperitoneal glucose, and during hyperthermia with or without previous glucose. (c): Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and Se-glucose were measured at different times after intraperitoneal glucose. (d): Mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, and heart rate were measured for 120 min after intraperitoneal glucose.;(a): The number of tumor controls and the growth delay was greatest with glucose 45 min before thermochemotherapy, and least with a time interval of 240 min. Glucose after thermochemotherapy delayed tumor growth. (b): After intraperitoneal glucose alone, intratumoral pH decreased gradually from 6.76 to 5.86 after 240 min. Hyperthermia 120 min after glucose induced a rapid further pH drop, while hyperthermia alone had no significant influence on pH. Intratumoral temperature was higher during hyperthermia in animals given glucose. (c): A substantial rise of Se-glucose and hemoglobin developed. The hemoconcentration was maintained also after reduction of Se-glucose towards normal values. (d): An initial tachycardia, and a reduction of the mean arterial pressure of about 10% 5-45 min after was measured.;The data indicate that a complex interaction between gradually reduced tumor pH, hyperglycemia, hemoconcentration, and reduced tumor blood flow, and not a breakdown of systemic circulation, is responsible for the effect of intraperitoneal glucose on thermochemotherapy with ACNU. Interestingly, enhancement of thermochemotherapy effect was also seen when intraperitoneal glucose was given after heat and ACNU.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the histologic pattern, anatomic distribution, and extent and outcome of surgery of Nigerian patients with spinal tumors.;This retrospective study comprised a cohort of Nigerians who underwent surgery for spinal tumors. Data obtained included patient demographics, duration of symptoms, anatomic location, imaging findings, Frankel grading before and after surgery, and type and outcome of surgery. Univariate analysis was performed, and results were compared with results from other parts of the world.;There were 59 patients (male-to-female ratio 1:1.1) with a bimodal age distribution. The highest (20.34%) incidence was seen in the 20-29 age group. More than half (58.06%) of the patients presented with a duration of symptoms of at least 6 months (duration of symptoms was >12 months in 35.48%). Motor deficit was present in 97.73% of patients at presentation. Functional grading was Frankel A in 38.10% of patients, Frankel C in 26.19%, Frankel B in 16.67%, Frankel D in 16.67%, and Frankel E in 2.38%. The tumors were mostly in the thoracic region (65.45%), and 58% were extradural in location. Gross total tumor excision was performed in 50.88% of the cases, and subtotal resection was performed in 24.56%. Spinal stabilization was performed in 17.86% with spinous process wiring and vertical strut being the most common method of stabilization (80%) among this group. Metastasis was the most common histologic tumor type (23.21%). Meningioma accounted for 12.50% of tumors, and ependymoma, astrocytoma, and hemangioma each accounted for 7.14%. The most common source of metastasis was the prostate (38.46%). Postoperatively, 45% of patients improved neurologically, 52.5% remained the same, and 2.5% deteriorated. There was no perioperative mortality.;Metastasis was the most common histologic type of spinal tumor in this study, and the most common location was extradural. The outcome was satisfactory in most cases with neurologic function remaining the same or improving after surgery in most patients.",

Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by feeding diets containing USP-grade diphenhydramine hydrochloride (greater than 99% pure) to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 14 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, mouse L5178Y cells, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Fourteen-Day and Thirteen-Week Studies: In the 14-day studies, dietary concentrations ranged from 620 to 10,000 ppm for rats and from 310 to 5,000 ppm for mice. All rats that received diets containing 10,000 ppm and 9/10 rats that received diets containing 5,000 ppm died before the end of the studies. The final mean body weights of rats receiving 1,250 or 2,500 ppm were 12%-13% or 30%-34% lower than those of controls. Feed consumption by rats at the three highest concentrations was more than 30% less than that by controls. All mice receiving 5,000 ppm, 4/5 males and 4/5 females receiving 2,500 ppm, and 4/5 males receiving 1,250 ppm died before the end of the studies. The final mean body weights of mice that received 1,250 or 2,500 ppm were lower than the initial weights. All dosed rats and mice were hyperactive and sensitive to sound and/or touch. In the 13-week studies, dietary concentrations of diphenhydramine hydrochloride ranged from 156 to 2,500 ppm for rats and from 78 to 1,250 ppm for mice. All rats lived to the end of the studies. The final mean body weights of rats receiving 1,250 or 2,500 ppm were about 15% or 35% lower than those of controls. The final mean body weight of female rats receiving 625 ppm was 9% lower than that of controls. Increased activity was observed for all male and female rats receiving 1,250 and 2,500 ppm. Cytoplasmic vacuolization of the liver, characteristic of fat accumulation, was observed in male and female rats receiving 313-2,500 ppm. The severity of this change increased with increased dose. For mice, 1/10 males receiving 313 ppm, 2/10 males receiving 625 ppm, and 8/10 males receiving 1,250 ppm died before the end of the studies. The final mean body weights of mice that received 625 or 1,250 ppm were about 9% or 16% lower than those of controls. No compound-related histopathological effects were observed in mice. Based on the mortality and body weight effects of diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the short-term studies, dietary concentrations selected for the 2-year studies were 0,313, and 635 ppm diphenhydramine hydrochloride for male rats and 0, 156, and 313 ppm for female rats and male and female mice. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Mean body weights of dosed and control rats were similar throughout the studies, and mean body weights of dosed mice were 3%-13% lower than those of controls throughout most of the studies. No significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of rats or mice of either sex (male rats: control, 29/50; low dose, 32/50; high dose, 24/50; female rats: 35/50; 32/50; 36/50; male mice: 29/50; 30/50; 24/48; female mice: 37/50; 39/50; 32/50). The estimated average daily feed consumption by dosed rats and dosed mice was similar to that by controls. The average amount of diphenhydramine hydrochloride consumed per day was approximately 13 or 27 mg/kg for low dose or high dose male rats, 7 or 15 mg/kg for low dose or high dose female rats, and 21 or 46-47 mg/kg for low dose or high dose male and female mice. Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: For three high dose male rats, astrocytomas were found in brain sections taken by routine sampling procedures. Gliomas, containing neoplastic astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, were found in one control and one additional high dose male rat. The incidence of glial cell tumors in high dose male rats (4/50) exceeded the highest incidence in historical controls in the Program (2/50). The historical incidence of glial cell tumors is less than 0.7% in approximately 2,000 untreated control male F344/N rats. Three addiless than 0.7&percnt; in approximately 2,000 untreated control male F344/N rats. Three additional sections of brain were prepared from the residual fixed tissues of each male and female rat. One additional astrocytoma in a high dose male rat and one astrocytoma in a high dose female rat were observed in these sections. Adenomas of the anterior pituitary gland in female rats occurred with a significant positive trend; the incidences in low dose male and high dose female rats were marginally greater than those in controls (male: control, 11/49; low dose, 21/50; high dose, 14/49; female: 23/50; 26/50; 35/50). The incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas in low dose male rats was slightly greater than that in controls (0/49; 5/50; 3/50). The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas (combined) in dosed male rats were not significantly different from that in controls (1/49; 6/50; 5/50) but exceeded the highest incidence in historicalcontrols (4/49). The historical incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms in untreated control male F344/N rats is approximately 2.2&percnt;. Adenomatous hyperplasia of the lung was not increased in incidence in dosed male rats compared with controls. The incidences of granulomas of the liver were increased in dosed rats (male: 0/49; 3/50; 4/50; female: 8/50; 15/49; 18/50). At no site were the incidences of neoplastic lesions in dosed mice considered to be compound related. Cytoplasmic vacuolization (fatty metamorphosis) of the liver was observed at an increased incidence in high dose female mice (0/49; 1/49; 8/49). Genetic Toxicology: Diphenhydramine hydrochloride was not mutagenic in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 when tested in either the presence or absence of exogenous metabolic activation. Exposure to this chemical did not induce trifluorothymidine (Tft) resistance in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells with or without metabolic activation. In cytogenetic tests with cultured CHO cells, diphenhydramine hydrochloride induced chromosomal aberrations in the absence, but not the presence, of exogenous metabolic activation (S9); no induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) was observed in these cells with or without S9. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of diphenhydramine hydrochloride for male F344/N rats, based on marginally increased incidences of uncommon brain neoplasms (astrocytomas or gliomas) and of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity for female F344/N rats, based on a marginal increase in the incidence of pituitary gland adenomas. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male or female B6C3F1 mice fed diets containing 156 or 313 ppm diphenhydramine hydrochloride.

The data obtained under these conditions provide reliable information on the frequency of central nervous system (CNS) involvement in a non-selected population of AIDS patients, most of whom were homosexuals (75.9%). One or several lesions were observed in 148 cases (85%). HIV encephalitis and/or leucoencephalopathy with multinucleated giant cells was found in 33 cases (18.9%). Opportunistic infections were identified in 91 patients (52.3%): toxoplasmosis (65 cases; 37.3%), cytomegalovirus encephalitis (25 cases; 14.3%), cryptococcosis (9 cases; 5.8%), progressive multifocal leukoencephalitis (5 cases; 2.8%), candidosis (1 case) and tuberculosis (1 case). Neoplasias were observed in 23 patients: primary (16 cases; 17.9%) or secondary malignant non Hodgkin's large B-cell lymphoma (3 cas; 1.1%), Kaposi's sarcoma (1 case) and glioma (3 cases; 1.1%). Non-specific lesions (vasculitic, hemorrhagic, metabolic and especially microglial nodules) were common. During the 6 years of study, the rate of CNS involvement was constant. The number of toxoplasmosis cases per year was stable, however, evolutive forms were more prevalent between 1982 and 1986, whereas treated inactive lesions were seen most frequently thereafter. The opportunistic complications were often associated and it should be noted that HIV encephalitis was associated with one of several such infections in 85% of the patients. This high rate of association suggests that these opportunistic infections may play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV encephalitis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) protein (merlin; schwannomin) is a tumor suppressor involved in tumorigenesis of NF2-associated and sporadic schwannomas and meningiomas. The protein shares the domain structure of three homologous proteins: ezrin, radixin and moesin (ERM). ERM proteins function as membrane organizers and may act as linkers between plasma membrane molecules, such as CD44 and ICAM-2, and the cytoskeleton. We analyzed the distribution and effects of transfected NF2 protein in COS-1, CHO and 293 cells, and endogenous NF2 protein in U251 glioma cells. The distribution was compared to ezrin, CD44 and F-actin. Both transfected and endogenous NF2 protein localized underneath the plasma membrane in a pattern typical of an ERM protein. In COS-1 transfectants, NF2 protein typically codistributed with ezrin but, in cells with poorly developed actin cytoskeleton, it replaced ezrin in filopodia and ruffling edges. NF2 protein colocalized with CD44, which in transfected cells accumulated into restructured cell membrane protrusions. The association of CD44 and NF2 protein was further suggested by binding of CD44 from cellular lysates to recombinant NF2 protein. Interaction between NF2 protein and the actin-containing cytoskeleton was indicated by partial colocalization, by cytochalasin B-induced coclustering, and by retention of NF2 protein in the detergent-insoluble fraction. Transfected NF2 protein induced morphogenic changes. The cells contained restructured membrane extensions and blebs, and CHO cells expressing NF2 protein were more elongated than control transfectants. In conclusion, NF2 protein possesses functional properties of an ERM family member.",

Previous reports have depicted morphological variations in the nature of stimulated neurites resulting from different neuritogenic agents, and a recent study by this laboratory demonstrated that such stimulants could be divided into two categories: those which induce axon-like neurites (group I) as opposed to those that stimulate dendrite-like outgrowths (group II). The former includes KCl, ionomycin, neuraminidase, and cholera toxin B subunit (all agents which elevate intracellular Ca2+), while the latter group is comprised of retinoic acid, dibutyryl cAMP, exogenous GM1, and low serum treatment. The present study was undertaken to determine whether differences in neuritic phenotype could be correlated with upregulation of nuclear GM1. The neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 cell line was employed because of its ability to respond robustly to a variety of neuritogenic stimuli. It was found that although both groups of stimulants are capable of inducing stable neurites (terminal differentiation) in this cell line, nuclear GM1 is elevated only in the presence of group I stimulants. Thus, a correlation is indicated between axonogenesis and upregulation of GM1 in the nuclear envelope. Additionally, these two events appear to coincide with elevation of intracellular Ca2+. Conversion of cells to the differentiated phenotype, with or without nuclear GM1 elevation, was found to depend in some cases on concentration of stimulant and duration of treatment.",

Substance P (free acid), fragments of the substance P precursor, and substance P-(1-9) displayed no activity. This indicates the importance of the hydrophobic C-terminal for stimulation of the hybrid cells. The potency was reduced with decreasing length the of C-terminal fragments. However, the substance P antagonists [D-Pro4,D-Trp7,9,Nle11]substance P-(4-11) and [D-Pro4,D-Trp7,9,10]substance P-(4-11) showed substantially greater activity than substance P-(4-11). Substance P-(6-11) (i.e. H-Arg-DTrp-MePhe-DTrp-Leu-Met-NH2) behaved as a mixed agonist-antagonist. At concentrations higher than 10 microM, it inhibited the stimulation exerted by substance P.

Herein, we show that extracellular HSP90α favors cell migration of glioblastoma U87 cells. More specifically, externally applied HSP90α rapidly induced endocytosis of EGFR. This response was accompanied by a transient increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) appearing after 1-3 min of treatment. In the presence of EGF, U87 cells showed HSP90α-induced Ca(2+) oscillations, which were reduced by the ATP/ADPase, apyrase, and inhibited by the purinergic P(2) inhibitor, suramin, suggesting that ATP release is requested. Disruption of lipid rafts with methyl β-cyclodextrin impaired the Ca(2+) rise induced by extracellular HSP90α combined with EGF. Specific inhibition of TLR4 expression by blocking antibodies suppressed extracellular HSP90α-induced Ca(2+) signaling and the associated cell migration. HSPs are known to bind lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). Preincubating cells with Polymyxin B, a potent LPS inhibitor, partially abrogated the effects of HSP90α without affecting Ca(2+) oscillations observed with EGF. Extracellular HSP90α induced EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr-1068, and this event was prevented by both the protein kinase Cδ inhibitor, rottlerin, and the c-Src inhibitor, PP2. Altogether, our results suggest that extracellular HSP90α transactivates EGFR/ErbB1 through TLR4 and a PKCδ/c-Src pathway, which induces ATP release and cytosolic Ca(2+) increase and finally favors cell migration. This mechanism could account for the deleterious effects of HSPs on high grade glioma when released into the tumor cell microenvironment.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Nitrosourea therapeutics occupies a definite place in cancer therapy but its exact mechanism of action has yet to be established. Nimustine, a chloroethyl nitrosourea derivative, is used to treat various types of malignancy including gliomas. The present work focuses on the understanding of nimustine interaction with DNA to delineate its mechanism at molecular level. Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) has been used to determine the binding sites of nimustine on DNA. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy has been used to confirm conformational variations in DNA molecule upon nimustine-DNA interaction. Thermodynamic parameters of nimustine-DNA reaction have been calculated by isothermal titration calorimetry. Results of the present study demonstrate that nimustine is not a simple alkylating agent rather it causes major grove-directed-alkylation. Spectroscopic data suggest binding of nimustine with nitrogenous bases guanine (C6 = O6) and thymine (C4 = O4) in DNA major groove. CD spectra of nimustine-DNA complexes point toward the perturbation of native B-conformation of DNA and its partial transition into C-form. Thermodynamically, nimustine-DNA interaction is an entropy driven endothermic reaction, which suggests hydrophobic interaction of nimustine in DNA-major groove pocket. Spectral results suggest base binding and local conformational changes in DNA upon nimustine interaction. Investigation of drug-DNA interaction is an essential part of rational drug designing that also provides information about the drug's action at molecular level. Results, demonstrated here, may contribute in the development of new nitrosourea therapeutics with better efficacy and fewer side effects.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The principal alkaloid of the family Calycanthaceae, calycanthine has long been recognized as a central convulsant. The alkaloid inhibited the potassium-stimulated release of [(3)H]GABA from slices of rat hippocampus with an ED(50) of approximately 21 microM. This effect appeared to be moderately selective since calycanthine at 100 microM had only a weak effect on the potassium-stimulated release of [(3)H]acetylcholine (15%) and no significant effects on the release of [(3)H]D-aspartate from hippocampal and cerebellar slices or the release of [(3)H]glycine from spinal cord slices. Calycanthine blocked the L-type calcium currents with an IC(50) of approximately 42 microM and also weakly inhibited the N-type calcium currents (IC(50) > 100 microM) from neuroblastoma X glioma cells, suggesting voltage-dependent calcium channel blockade as a possible mechanism for its inhibition of GABA and ACh release. Calycanthine was also found to directly inhibit GABA-mediated currents (K(B) approximately 135 microM) from human alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2L) GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes but had no effect at 100 microM on human rho(1) GABA(c) receptors. The results indicated that calycanthine may mediate its convulsant action predominantly by inhibiting the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA as a result of interactions with L-type Ca(2+) channels and by inhibiting GABA-mediated chloride currents at GABA(A) receptors.",

N5-2OH is an excellent substrate of thymidine kinase 1 and its favorable biodistribution profile in rodents led to successful preclinical NCT of rats bearing intracerebral RG2 glioma. The present study explored cellular influx and efflux mechanisms of N5-2OH, as well as its intracellular anabolism beyond the monophosphate level. N5-2OH entered cultured human CCRF-CEM cells via passive diffusion, whereas the multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 appeared to be a major mediator of N5-2OH monophosphate efflux. N5-2OH was effectively monophosphorylated in cultured murine L929 [thymidine kinase 1 (TK1(+))] cells whereas formation of N5-2OH monophosphate was markedly lower in L929 (TK1(-)) cell variants. Further metabolism to the di- and triphosphate forms was not observed in any of the cell lines. Regardless of monophosphorylation, parental N5-2OH was the major intracellular component in both TK1(+) and TK1(-) cells. Phosphate transfer experiments with enzyme preparations showed that N5-2OH monophosphate, as well as the monophosphate of a second 3-carboranyl thymidine analog [3-[5-(o-carboran-1-yl)pentan-1-yl]thymidine (N5)], were not substrates of thymidine monophosphate kinase. Surprisingly, N5-diphosphate was phosphorylated by nucleoside diphosphate kinase although N5-triphosphate apparently was not a substrate of DNA polymerase. Our results provide valuable information on the cellular metabolism and pharmacokinetic profile of 3-carboranyl thymidine analogs. ",

Conventional image analysis systems are relatively expensive. We therefore compared the performance of a professional image analysis system with an inexpensive setup by evaluating tumor size in an orthotopic glioma mouse model. The maximum cross-sectional tumor area of H&E stained brain-slides of two groups of mice (treatment and control group) was measured by two independent investigators using a professional image analysis system (Leica DM IRB microscope) with the Leica Quantimet 500c software, and a low-cost-system (Intel QX3 microscope) with a non-commercial image analysis software. Mean tumor volumes were calculated and the results from each of the image analysis systems, investigators, and treatment effects were compared. The tumor volumes as measured with the low-cost and the professional system differed between -3.7 and +7.5% (P = 0.69-0.99). Measurements made by investigator A and B differed between -7.0 and +3.9% (P = 0.69-0.88). Treatment in all cases significantly reduced the tumor volume between 58.4 and 62.7% (P = 0.0002 or 0.0003), regardless of the investigator or the used image analysis system. We therefore conclude that the QX3 low-cost microscope in combination with a non-commercial image-analysis software represents an inexpensive solution to reliably analyze the size of regions of interest, if they provide a sufficient contrast. However, the low-cost setup due to its low resolution definitely limits a detailed analysis of histologic features.",

Experimental studies demonstrated no uptake of (18)F-FET in inflammatory cells but increased uptake has been reported in single cases of human brain abscesses. To explore this inconsistency, we investigated the uptake of (18)F-FET in comparison with that of L-[methyl-(3)H]methionine ((3)H-MET) and D-(3)H-deoxyglucose ((3)H-DG) in brain and calf abscesses in rats.;Abscesses were induced in the brain (n = 9) and calf (n = 5) of Fisher CDF rats after inoculation of Staphylococcus aureus. Five days later, (18)F-FET and (3)H-MET (n = 10) or (18)F-FET and (3)H-DG (n = 4) were injected intravenously. One hour after injection the rats were sacrificed, and the brain or calf muscle was investigated using dual-tracer autoradiography. Lesion-to-background ratios (L/B) and standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated. The autoradiograms were compared with histology and immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), CD68 for macrophages, and CD11b for microglia.;(18)F-FET uptake in the area of macrophage infiltration and activated microglia at the rim of the brain abscesses was low (L/B, 1.5 +/- 0.4). In contrast, high uptake was observed for (3)H-MET as well as for (3)H-DG (L/B, 4.1 +/- 1.1 for (3)H-MET vs. 3.1 +/- 1.5 for (3)H-DG; P < 0.01 vs. (18)F-FET). Results for calf abscesses were similar. In the vicinity of the brain abscesses, slightly increased uptake was noted for (18)F-FET (L/B, 1.8 +/- 0.3) and (3)H-MET (L/B, 1.8 +/- 0.4), whereas (3)H-DG distribution was normal (L/B, 1.2 +/- 0.2). Anti-GFAP immunofluorescence showed a diffuse astrocytosis in those areas.;Our results demonstrate that there is no accumulation of (18)F-FET in macrophages and activated microglia in experimental brain abscesses, whereas (3)H-MET and (3)H-DG exhibit high uptake in these cells. Thus, the specificity of (18)F-FET for gliomas may be superior to that (3)H-MET and (3)H-DG. Increased (18)F-FET uptake in human brain abscesses appears to be related to reactive astrocytosis.",

These options have been evaluated for populations with a median age of approximately 58 years. We therefore addressed the issue of whether elderly patients (>65 years) could also benefit from cytoreductive surgery (CS) and adjuvant treatment using alkylating chemotherapy. One-hundred and three patients suffering from newly diagnosed, primary supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme >65 years (median 70.8 years) were identified in our single-center glioma database (2002-2007) and retrospectively divided into group A (n = 31) treated with surgery alone (biopsy, BY, n = 21, CS n = 10), group B (n = 37) surgery plus radiation (BY n = 18, CS n = 19), and group C (n = 35) surgery, RT and CHX (BY n = 4, CS n = 31). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OAS) were determined in each group and correlated to age, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), and extent of resection (biopsy (BY), partial (PR), and complete resection (CR)). Progression was defined according the Macdonald criteria. For all patients PFS and OAS were 3.2 months and 5.1 months (m) respectively. PFS and OAS for groups A/B/C were 1.8/3.2/6.4 m (P = 0.000) and 2.2/4.4/15.0 m (P = 0.000), respectively. Median age for groups A/B/C was 74.4/70.6/68.5 years and median KPS was 60/70/80. Age (<75, ≥75) was inversely correlated with OAS (5.8/2.5 m, P = 0.01). KPS (<70, ≥70) was correlated with OAS 2.4/6.5 m (P = 0.000). Extent of resection (BY, PR, or CR) correlated with PFS (2.1/3.4/6.4 m, P = 0,000) and OS (2.2/7.0/13.9 m, P = 0,000), respectively. Our study shows that elderly GBM patients can benefit from maximum treatment procedures with cytoreductive microsurgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Treatment options are obviously affected by KPS and age. The most impressive outcome predictor in this population was the extent of microsurgical resection for patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. To conclude, elderly GBM patients should not be per se excluded from intensive treatment procedures.",

This includes colony formation by lymphoid T and B cells in capillary cultures, as well as mitogen activation of T, B and NK cells. At higher concentrations, i.e., above 1 X 10(-7) M, an inhibitory effect was found on colony formation. Neither the production of interleukin (IL) 3 by mitogen-activated T cells, nor the proliferation of the IL-3-dependent L/B cell line were affected by the peptide up to 1 X 10(-5) M. A slight inhibitory effect was found above 1 X 10(-9) M on mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. A series of malignant cell lines was also tested. No effect was seen between 1 X 10(-11) and 1 X 10(-7) M on human mammary carcinoma cells in culture. On Ehrlich ascites mouse mammary carcinoma cells a 30% inhibition was seen at 10(-6) M. On a human glioblastoma cell line (GaMg) no effect was seen, and on a rat glioma cell line (BT5C) an inhibitory effect was seen at 1 X 10(-7) M and above. No significant inhibition of cell growth was seen on SC1 mouse lymphoma cells from 1 X 10(-9) to 1 X 10(-5) M during 7 days of culture. The investigated normal and malignant cell types in culture were thus not inhibited in very low concentrations which act on CFU-gm. However, a variable inhibitory effect was found at higher concentrations where the inhibition of myelopoiesis was maximal and at concentrations where the inhibition is released. The hemoregulatory peptide thus seems to be a concentration-dependent selective inhibitor of myelopoiesis. The finding that various malignant cells do not respond at lower concentrations supports the possibility of using the peptide as a protector of normal cells during cancer chemotherapy.",

Sucrose density centrifugation revealed that the phosphatase activities exhibited sedimentation coefficients of 4.37, 4.23, and 4.59 for proteins derived from C6, GH3, and PC12 cells, respectively. The Stokes radii measured for the PC12 and C6 activities were 41.8 and 40.0 A, respectively. The estimated molecular weights calculated for the enzymes from these data are 79,100 and 72,200. The phosphatase activities required the presence of divalent cations such as Ca2+ or Mn2+ for expression of activity, which was optimal only in the presence of calmodulin. The apparent Km for phosphorylated myelin basic protein substrate was 8 microM. Affinity-purified antibodies to the B subunit of bovine brain CaMDP were found by immunoblot (Western blot) to cross-react with a single protein among proteins extracted from PC12, C6, and GH3 cells that had been resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis. In each case, the cross-reacting protein exhibited an Mr of 16,000 and an isoelectric point of 4.7, values virtually identical to those reported previously for the B subunit of bovine brain CaMDP (sometimes called calcineurin). This cross-reacting protein was found among cellular proteins eluted from immobilized calmodulin by EGTA. Immunocytochemical localization of the cross-reacting protein in undifferentiated PC12 cells or in cells differentiated in response to nerve growth factor revealed its presence diffusely throughout the cytoplasm.

Herein, we assessed new strategies to optimize Flt3L/TK therapeutic efficacy in a refractory RG2 orthotopic glioblastoma model. Specifically, we aimed to optimize the therapeutic efficacy of Flt3L/TK treatment in the RG2 model by overexpressing the following genes within the brain tumor microenvironment: 1) a TK mutant with enhanced cytotoxicity (SR39 mutant TK), 2) Flt3L-IgG fusion protein that has a longer half-life, 3) CD40L to stimulate DC maturation, 4) T helper cell type 1 polarizing dendritic cell cytokines interleukin-12 or C-X-C motif ligand 10 chemokine (CXCL)-10, 5) C-C motif ligand 2 chemokine (CCL2) or C-C motif ligand 3 chemokine (CCL3) to enhance dendritic cell recruitment into the tumor microenvironment, 6) T helper cell type 1 cytokines interferon-γ or interleukin-2 to enhance effector T-cell functions, and 7) IκBα or p65RHD (nuclear factor kappa-B [NF-κB] inhibitors) to suppress the function of Foxp3+ Tregs and enhanced effector T-cell functions. Anti-tumor immunity and tumor specific effector T-cell functions were assessed by cytotoxic T lymphocyte assay and intracellular IFN-γ staining. Our data showed that overexpression of interferon-γ or interleukin-2, or inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa-B within the tumor microenvironment, enhanced cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated immune responses and successfully extended the median survival of rats bearing intracranial RG2 when combined with Flt3L/TK. These findings indicate that enhancement of T-cell functions constitutes a critical therapeutic target to overcome immune evasion and enhance therapeutic efficacy for brain cancer.

For example rhesus TRIM5α (rhTRIM5α) can potently restrict HIV-1 infection while human TRIM5α (huTRIM5α) only has a mild effect on SIVmac and HIV-1 infectivity (Lv1). Human TRIM5α is able to restrict MLV-N virus replication, but is ineffective against MLV-B or MLV-NB virus infection. Lv2 restriction of some HIV-2 viruses is seen in human cells. Like Lv1, Lv2 is a post-entry restriction factor, whose viral determinants have been mapped to the viral capsid (CA). Unlike Lv1, however, Lv2 is determined by envelope (Env) in addition to CA. Here we present evidence of a novel Env determined post entry restriction to infection in human cells of pseudotyped MLV-B and MLV-NB cores.;We generated retroviral vectors pseudotyped with various gamma and lentiviral Envs on MLV-B and -NB CAs containing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter. Flow cytometry was used to determine transduction efficiencies in NP2/CD4/CXCR4 (glioma cell line stably transduced with the HIV receptors) and HeLa/CD4 cell lines. The HeLa/CD4 cell line restricted both MLV CAs in an Env dependent manner, compared to NP2/CD4/CXCR4 cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QT-PCR) analysis of reverse transcription (RT) transcripts demonstrates that this restriction occurs at a post entry and RT level. siRNA knockdown of huTRIM5α ruled out a direct role for this cellular component in mediating this restriction. We describe a previously unobserved Env determined restriction of MLV-B and MLV-NB CAs in HeLa/CD4 cells when pseudotyped with HIV-2 and RD114 Envs, but not gibbon ape leukaemia virus (GALV), HIV-1 or Amphotrophic (Ampho) Envs.;Our data further demonstrate the variability of Env and CA mediated susceptibility to post entry host cell restriction. We discuss the relevance of these findings in light of the growing evidence supporting the complexities involved in innate host immunity to retroviral infection.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Glucocorticoids are potent antiinflammatory drugs. They inhibit the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules. It has recently been proposed that the underlying basis to such inhibition is the induction of the protein I kappa B, which inhibits the transcription factor NF-kappa B. The latter is a key activator of the genes encoding cytokines and adhesion molecules. The present study shows that the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, inhibits the induction of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 and the adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in human 1321N1 astrocytoma and SK.N.SH neuroblastoma cells. However, dexamethasone failed to induce I kappa B or inhibit activation of NF-kappa B by IL-1 in the two cell types. EMSA confirmed the identity of the activated NF-kappa B by demonstrating that an oligonucleotide, containing the wild-type NF-kappa B-binding motif, inhibited formation of the NF-kappa B-DNA complexes whereas a mutated form of the NF-kappa B-binding motif was ineffective. In addition, supershift analysis showed that the protein subunits p50 and p65 were prevalent components in the activated NF-kappa B complexes. The lack of effect of dexamethasone on the capacity of IL-1 to activate NF-kappa B correlated with its inability to induce I kappa B and the ability of IL-1 to cause degradation of I kappa B, even in the presence of dexamethasone. The results presented in this paper strongly suggest that glucocorticoids may exert antiinflammatory effects in cells of neural origin by a mechanism(s) independent of NF-kappa B.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Tumours of the central nervous system are the most common solid tumour, accounting for a quarter of the 1500 cases of childhood cancer diagnosed each year in the U.K. They are the most common cause of cancer-related death in children. Treatment consists of surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Survival rates have generally increased, but many survivors suffer from radiotherapy-related neurocognitive and endocrine side effects as well as an increased risk of secondary cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy is normally given in combination to circumvent chemoresistance, but several studies have demonstrated it to be ineffective in the absence of radiotherapy. The identification of children with drug-resistant disease at the outset could allow stratification of those that are potentially curable by chemotherapy alone. Ultimately, however, what is required is a means to overcome this drug resistance and restore the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Medulloblastomas and ependymomas account for over 30% of paediatric brain tumours. Advances in neurosurgery, adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy have led to improvements in 5-year overall survival rates. There remain, however, significant numbers of medulloblastoma patients that have intrinsically drug-resistant tumours and/or present with disseminated disease. Local relapse in ependymoma is also common and has an extremely poor prognosis with only 25% of children surviving first relapse. Each of these is consistent with the acquisition of drug and radiotherapy resistance. Since the majority of chemotherapy drugs currently used to treat these patients are transport substrates for ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) we will address the hypothesis that ABCB1 expression underlies this drug resistance.

The amount of lipid varied significantly from sample to sample in a grade 2 astrocytoma and grade 4 astrocytoma samples with 0-5% necrosis but did not correlate with the site in the tumour or histopathological characteristics.

In addition, nerve growth factor expression is stimulated, as seen by mRNA accumulation and protein secretion, in primary astrocytes and one of the two C6 subclones, with an apparent correlation with the transience of c-fos induction. The activation of protein kinase C appears as an obligatory step during these processes, because (a) inhibition of protein kinase C by staurosporine blocks the induction by endothelin or phorbol esters of both c-fos and nerve growth factor, and (b) phorbol ester-evoked down-regulation of protein kinase C completely abolishes the c-fos induction by endothelin, but not that by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, a known activator of the cyclic AMP-dependent pathway.

In this work, we describe that in U373 MG astrocytoma cells, nanomolar concentrations of substance P potently triggered activation of NF-kappa B, a transcription factor involved in the control of cytokine expression and apoptosis. Substance P-induced NF-kappa B activation was associated with the increased mRNA expression and secretion of IL-8, an NF-kappa B-controlled target gene. The stimulatory effect of substance P was specific, since an NK-1-selective receptor antagonist completely prevented NF-kappa B activation in response to substance P, but not IL-1 beta. In addition, we show that the activity of substance P required mobilization of intracellular calcium and formation of reactive oxygen intermediates as second messengers.

Recently, we have introduced novel ceramide analogs of the beta-hydroxy alkyl amide type, which trigger pro-apoptotic signaling pathways without prior elevation of endogenous ceramide. They induce apoptosis specifically in rapidly dividing neuroblastoma cells, but not in resting or differentiated cells. We characterize new ceramide mimics that have been derived from N-acylation of serinol (S), diethanolamine (B), propanolamine (P), and tris(hydroxy-methyl)methylamine (T) with myristic (14), palmitic (16), or oleic (18) acid. The water solubility of these compounds exceeds that of ceramide by more than 100-fold (up to 5 mM). Apoptosis of human neuroblastoma, glioma, medulloblastoma, and adenocarcinoma cells is induced by N-(2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl)-palmitoylamide, C16-serinol (S16), N-(2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl)-oleoylamide, C18-serinol (S18), N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-myristoyl-amide (B16), and N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-oleoylamide (T18) within 60 min of incubation, and is completed even after removal of the compound from the medium. This is most likely due to a rapid uptake of the analogs followed by their slow release from the cells. Alteration of the acyl chain length to less than 14 methylene units, removal of the amino group, or reducing the number of hydroxyalkyl residues to less than two significantly lowers or eliminates the pro-apoptotic potential of these compounds. The target specificity of novel ceramide analogs for tumor cells, their water solubility, and fast pro-apoptotic mechanism indicates a high therapeutic potential for cancer treatment.",

Confocal lasers scanning microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging showed a high specificity of the correct conjugate for the PC3 xenografts. Staining of the PC3 xenografts was much weaker with the scrambled conjugate while the Colo205 xenografts showed no marked staining with any of the conjugates. In vitro experiments comparing the correct and scrambled conjugates on PC3 cells by magnetic resonance relaxometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting confirmed markedly higher specificity of the correct conjugate.

Sunitinib has not shown significant activity in GBM clinical trials, despite positive results seen in preclinical xenograft studies. We performed in vivo studies in transgenic Friend leukemia virus strain B mice: wild-type, Mdr1a/b(-/-), Bcrp1(-/-), and Mdr1a/b(-/-)Bcrp1(-/-) genotypes were examined. The brain-to-plasma area under the curve ratio after an oral dose (20 mg/kg) was similar to the steady-state tissue distribution coefficient, indicating linear distribution kinetics in mice over this concentration range. Furthermore, the distribution of sunitinib to the brain increased after administration of selective P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) pharmacological inhibitors and a dual inhibitor, elacridar, comparable to that of the corresponding transgenic genotype. The brain-to-plasma ratio after coadministration of elacridar in wild-type mice was ≈ 12 compared with ≈ 17.3 in Mdr1a/b(-/-)Bcrp1(-/-) mice. Overall, these findings indicate that there is a cooperation at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in restricting the brain penetration of sunitinib, and brain delivery can be enhanced by administration of a dual inhibitor. These data indicate that the presence of cooperative efflux transporters, P-gp and Bcrp, in an intact BBB can protect invasive glioma cells from chemotherapy. Thus, one may consider the use of transporter inhibition as a powerful adjuvant in the design of future clinical trials for the targeted delivery of sunitinib in GBM.",

Chemotherapy has been observed to prolong overall survival rate and temozolomide (TMZ), a promising chemotherapeutic agent for treating glioblastoma (GBM), possesses the most effective clinical activity at present, although drug resistance limits its clinical outcome. Growing evidence supports the concept that initial and recurrent GBM may derive from glioblastoma stem cells, which may be responsible for drug resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance remain to be elucidated. In the present study, a TMZ‑resistant GBM cell line, U251R, was developed and subsequently divided into two subpopulations according to the CD133 immunophenotype. No significant difference was identified in the expression of O6‑methylguanine‑DNA‑methyltransferase (MGMT) between CD133+ U251R cells and CD133‑ U251R cells, whereas the CD133+ cell population was more resistant to TMZ‑induced growth inhibition and cell death. TMZ achieves its cytotoxic effect by inducing DNA lesions and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) is an essential mediator of DNA damage‑induced apoptosis independently of p53 status. Therefore, whether PUMA effectively enhances growth suppression and induces apoptosis when combined with TMZ was investigated. Consequently, it was found that adenoviruses expressing wild‑type‑PUMA not only lead to the apoptosis of CD133+ U251R cells alone, but also significantly increase their sensitivity toward TMZ by elevating the Bcl‑2‑associated X protein/B‑cell lymphoma‑2 ratio without alterations in MGMT expression. Therefore, PUMA may be a suitable target for intervention to improve the therapeutic efﬁcacy of TMZ. ",

Several works have reported the therapeutic interest of the radiotherapy modality at preclinical level, but biological mechanisms responsible for the described efficacy are not fully understood to date. The aim of this study was to identify the early transcriptomic responses of normal brain and glioma tissue in rats after MRT irradiation (400Gy). The transcriptomic analysis of similarly irradiated normal brain and tumor tissues was performed 6 hours after irradiation of 9 L orthotopically tumor-bearing rats. Pangenomic analysis revealed 1012 overexpressed and 497 repressed genes in the irradiated contralateral normal tissue and 344 induced and 210 repressed genes in tumor tissue. These genes were grouped in a total of 135 canonical pathways. More than half were common to both tissues with a predominance for immunity or inflammation (64 and 67% of genes for normal and tumor tissues, respectively). Several pathways involving HMGB1, toll-like receptors, C-type lectins and CD36 may serve as a link between biochemical changes triggered by irradiation and inflammation and immunological challenge. Most immune cell populations were involved: macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer, T and B lymphocytes. Among them, our results highlighted the involvement of Th17 cell population, recently described in tumor. The immune response was regulated by a large network of mediators comprising growth factors, cytokines, lymphokines. In conclusion, early response to MRT is mainly based on inflammation and immunity which appear therefore as major contributors to MRT efficacy. ",

Naturally, LLT1 is expressed on the surface of NK cells, stimulating IFN-γ production, and is up-regulated upon activation of other immune cells, e.g. TLR-stimulated dendritic cells and B cells or T cell receptor-activated T cells. While in normal tissues LLT1:NKR-P1 interaction (representing an alternative \"missing-self\" recognition system) play an immunomodulatory role in regulation of crosstalk between NK and antigen presenting cells, LLT1 is upregulated in glioblastoma cells, one of the most lethal tumors, where it acts as a mediator of immune escape of glioma cells. Here we report transient expression and characterization of soluble His176Cys mutant of LLT1 ectodomain in an eukaryotic expression system of human suspension-adapted HEK293S GnTI(-) cell line with uniform N-glycans. The His176Cys mutation is critical for C-type lectin-like domain stability, leading to the reconstruction of third canonical disulfide bridge in LLT1, as shown by mass spectrometry. Purified soluble LLT1 is homogeneous, deglycosylatable and forms a non-covalent homodimer whose dimerization is not dependent on presence of its N-glycans. As a part of production of soluble LLT1, we have adapted HEK293S GnTI(-) cell line to growth in suspension in media facilitating transient transfection and optimized novel high cell density transfection protocol, greatly enhancing protein yields. This transfection protocol is generally applicable for protein production within this cell line, especially for protein crystallography. ",

In cytotoxicity studies, M-CSF activated macrophages and freshly isolated macrophages killed NBXFO cells in the presence of polymyxin B, eliminating the possibility that contaminating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was responsible for the delivery of the cytotoxic signal. Retroviral-mediated transfection of T9 glioma cells with the gene for the membrane isoform of M-CSF (mM-CSF), but not for the secreted isoform of M-CSF, transferred the ability of macrophages to kill these transfected T9 cells in a mM-CSF dose-dependent manner. Macrophage-mediated killing of the mM-CSF transfected clone was blocked by using a 100-fold excess of recombinant M-CSF. Catalase, superoxide dismutase, and the nitric oxide inhibitor, N-omega-nitro-arginine methyl ester (NAME), did not effect macrophage cytotoxicity against the mM-CSF transfectant T9 clones. T9 parental cells when cultured in the presence of an equal number of the mM-CSF transfectant cells were not killed, indicating specific target cell cytotoxicity by the macrophages.

We sought to determine if Vδ1+ γδ T cells were cytotoxic to GBM and the extent to which their cytotoxicity was CMV dependent. We examined the cytotoxic effect of ex vivo expanded/activated Vδ1+ γδ T cells from healthy CMV seropositive and CMV seronegative donors on unmanipulated and CMV-infected established GBM cell lines and cell lines developed from short- term culture of primary tumors. Expanded/activated Vδ1+ T cells killed CMV-negative U251, U87, and U373 GBM cell lines and two primary tumor explants regardless of the serologic status of the donor. Experimental CMV infection did not increase Vδ1+ T cell--mediated cytotoxicity and in some cases the cell lines were more resistant to lysis when infected with CMV.

These studies show that ex vivo expanded/activated Vδ1+ γδ T cells readily recognize and kill established GBM cell lines and primary tumor-derived GBM cells regardless of whether CMV infection is present, however, CMV may enhance the resistance GBM cell lines to innate recognition possibly contributing to the poor immunogenicity of GBM.",

The principle of our study was to better understand the genetic mechanism of oncogenesis for human breast cancer and to discover new possible tumor markers for use in clinical practice. We used complimentary DNA (cDNA) microarrays to compare gene expression profiles of treated Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) with recombinant bromelain and untreated MCF-7. SpringGene analysis was carried out of differential expression followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), to understand the underlying consequence in developing disease and disorders. We identified 1,102 known genes differentially expressed to a significant degree (p<0.001) changed between the treatment. Within this gene set, 20 genes were significantly changed between treated cells and the control cells with cutoff fold change of more than 1.5. These genes are RNA-binding motif, single-stranded interacting protein 1 (RBMS1), ribosomal protein L29 (RPL29), glutathione S-transferase mu 2 (GSTM2), C15orf32, Akt3, B cell translocation gene 1 (BTG1), C6orf62, C7orf60, kinesin-associated protein 3 (KIFAP3), FBXO11, AT-rich interactive domain 4A (ARID4A), COPS2, TBPL1|SLC2A12, TMEM59, SNORD46, glioma tumor suppressor candidate region gene 2 (GLTSCR2), and LRRFIP. Our observation on gene expression indicated that recombinant bromelain produces a unique signature affecting different pathways, specific for each congener.

The aim of the study was to isolate the bioactive components from the rhizomes of Dioscorea nipponica and to evaluate their anti-neuroinfalmmatory and neuroprotective activities.;The phytochemical investigation of 50% EtOH extract of Dioscorea nipponica using successive column chromatography over silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, and preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) resulted in the isolation and identification of 17 phenolic derivatives, including four new phenolic compounds (1-4). The structural elucidation of these compounds was based on spectroscopic methods, including 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy techniques, mass spectrometry, and optical rotation. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their effects on nerve growth factor (NGF) secretion in a C6 rat glioma cell line and nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated BV2 cells. The neurite outgrowth of compound 16 was further evaluated by using mouse neuroblastoma N2a cell lines.;Three new stilbene derivatives, diosniponol C (1), D (2) and diosniposide A (3) and one new phenanthrene glycoside, diosniposide B (4), together with 13 known compounds were isolated from the rhizomes of Dioscorea nipponica. Of the tested compounds (1-17), phenanthrene, 3,7-dihydroxy-2,4,6-trimethoxy-phenanthrene (16) was the most potent NGF inducer, with 162.35±16.18% stimulation, and strongly reduced NO levels with an IC50 value of 19.56 μM in BV2 microglial cells. Also, it significantly increased neurite outgrowth in N2a cells.;This study supports the ethnopharmacological use of Dioscorea nipponica rhizomes as traditional medicine.",

Fibrogenic cells activate in response to a variety of cytokines, growth factors, and inflammatory mediators. The involvement of members of the epidermal growth factor family in this process has been suggested. Amphiregulin is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand specifically induced upon liver injury. We investigated the effects of quercetin on the amphiregulin/EGFR signal and on the activation of downstream pathways leading to cell growth. Rats were divided into 4 groups (8 rats/group): rats subjected to common bile duct ligation (CBDL), Sham (rats subjected to simulated CBDL), quercetin-treated sham, and quercetin-treated CBDL (CBDL-Q). Quercetin (50 mg/kg i.p. injection) was administered daily for 2 wk starting on d 14 after surgery. Overexpression of amphiregulin, EGFR, TNFα, IL-6, TGFβ, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), extracellular regulated kinase, protein kinase B (Akt), cycloxygenase (COX)-2, and glioma-associated oncogenes (GLI)-1 and-2 were observed in liver of CBDL rats after 4 wk of bile duct ligation. CBDL-Q rats had a significantly diminished expression of amphiregulin and EGFR compared with untreated CBDL rats. Furthermore, mRNA levels of TNFα, IL-6, TGFβ, and PDGF and the protein content of COX-2, GLI-1, and GLI-2 were significantly lower in CBDL-Q rats than in untreated CBDL rats. The findings indicate that quercetin ameliorated activation of survival pathways and downregulated the expression of genes related to inflammation and precancerous conditions. Suppression of amphiregulin/EGFR signals may contribute to this effect.",

Maximum follow-up included six examinations per patient by either method during 18 months. Criteria were set for: (1) regression (> or = 25% tumor reduction), (2) status quo (< 25% reduction and < 25% increase), and (3) progression of disease (> or = 25% tumor increase). Results were compared with the clinical state of disease. Changes of tumor volume, contrast enhancement, necrosis, hemorrhage and edema on MRI were compared to changes in 201thallium uptake volumes and 1H-MRS metabolite ratios.;Six patients were followed with a total of twenty-four examinations with 201thallium SPECT, MRI and 1H-MRS, respectively, between February 1997 and October 1998. Five patients developed clinical progression of disease, 4 out of 5 cases showed SPECT progression, 4 out of 5 cases MRI progression, and 1 out of 2 interpretable cases 1H-MRS progression at final assessment before clinical deterioration. During the phase of clinically stable disease; (A) the criterion for regression or status quo was met in 10 out of 13 assessments with SPECT, 11 out of 13 with MRI, and 8 out of 9 interpretable 1H-MRS; (B) the criterion for progression was met in 3 out of 13 with SPECT, 2 out of 13 with MRI, and 1 out of 9 interpretable 1H-MRS. The accuracy of SPECT, MRI, and 1H-MRS in identifying changes of tumor burden concordant with patients' clinical course was 78%, 83%, and 82%, respectively. SPECT regression was associated with MRI decrease of tumor size, contrast enhancement, edema and hemorrhage. SPECT progression was associated with MRI increase of the same parameters and the increase of necrosis. 1H-MRS regression was associated with decrease of edema. 1H-MRS progression was associated with increase of tumor size, hemorrhage, and increase or decrease of contrast enhancement.;Both 201thallium SPECT and 1H-MRS evaluation showed sensitivity for detection of astrocytoma progression. We did not find a higher accuracy of SPECT or MRS than of MRI in astrocytoma chemotherapy monitoring. Treatment induced MRI changes were associated with 201thallium uptake variations. 1H-MRS was difficult to apply for astrocytoma treatment monitoring. Improvements regarding size of measurement area such as multivoxel MRS and fat suppression pulses appeared desirable, and also the use of functional techniques with superior resolution such as dual isotope SPECT. However, our results suggest that 201thallium SPECT and 1H-MRS can provide additional information to MRI for chemotherapy efficacy evaluation in selected cases.",

To test the possibility that cIFs are complementary nuclear matrix elements, the nuclei of a series of cultured cells were subjected to the Li-diiodosalicylate (LIS) extraction protocol developed for the preparation of nuclear matrices and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting with antibodies directed against lamin B and cIF proteins. When nuclei released from hypotonically swollen L929 suspension cells in the presence of digitonin or Triton X-100 were exposed to such strong shearing forces that a considerable number were totally disrupted, a thin, discontinuous layer of vimentin IFs remained tenaciously adhering to still intact nuclei, in apparent coalignment with the nuclear lamina. Even in broken nuclei, the distribution of vimentin followed that of lamin B in areas where the lamina still appeared intact. The same retention of vimentin together with desmin and glial IFs was observed on the nuclei isolated from differentiating C2C12 myoblast and U333 glioma cells, respectively. Nuclei from epithelial cells shed their residual perinuclear IF layers as coherent cytoskeletal ghosts, except for small fractions of vimentin and cytokeratin IFs, which remained in a dot-to cap-like arrangement on the nuclear surface, in apparent codistribution with lamin B. LIS extraction did not bring about a reduction in the cIF protein contents of such nuclei upon their transformation into nuclear matrices. Moreover, in whole mount preparations of mouse embryo fibroblasts, DNA/chromatin emerging from nuclei during LIS extraction mechanically and chemically cleaned the nuclear surface and perinuclear area from loosely anchored cytoplasmic material with the production of broad, IF-free annular spaces, but left substantial fractions of the vimentin IFs in tight association with the nuclear surface. Accordingly, double-immunogold electron microscopy of fixed and permeabilized fibroblasts disclosed a close neighborhood of vimentin IFs and lamin B, with a minimal distance between the nanogold particles of ca. 30 nm. These data indicate an extremely solid interconnection of cIFs with structural elements of the nuclear matrix, and make them, together with their susceptibility to crosslinkage to MARs and other genomic DNA sequences under native conditions, complementary or even integral constituents of the karyoskeleton.",

A grade III human astrocytoma-derived cell line was used to study the role of PKC in PR phosphorylation, transcriptional activity, and degradation. Treatment with PKC activator [tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA)] increased PR phosphorylation in Ser400 after 5 minutes, which in turn induced PR transcriptional activity and its subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome 3-5 hours after treatment. Silencing or inhibition of PKCα and PKCδ blocked PR phosphorylation and degradation induced by TPA. Both PR isoforms were associated with PKCα and reached the maximum association after 5 minutes of TPA addition. These data correlated with immunnofluorescence assays in which nuclear colocalization of PKCα with PR increased after TPA treatment. We observed a 2-fold increase in cell proliferation after PKC activation with TPA that was reduced with the PR antagonist, RU486. The PR S400A mutant revealed that this residue is essential for PKC-mediated PR phosphorylation and degradation. Our results show a key participation of PKCα and PKCδ in PR regulation and function.",

By 12 h of IL-4 treatment, both cdk4 and cdk2 kinase activities against the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) were reduced and nuclear entry of pRb was prohibited. Twelve-hour cdk complexes contained elevated p21(waf1/cip1) but not p27(kip1), p15(ink4B) or p16(ink4A).

        "Doc_abstract":"Recently we reported that oxidant tumor promoters can induce the oxidative modification of protein kinase C (PKC) resulting in either activation or inactivation of the kinase (R. Gopalakrishna and W. B. Anderson, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 285, 382-387, 1991). Since retinoids previously have been shown to antagonize the actions of tumor promoters, studies were carried out to determine if retinoids can inhibit the oxidative modification of PKC induced by tumor promoters. Prior treatment of B16 melanoma cells or C6 glioma cells with all-trans-retinoic acid (0.1 microM) for a short time period (15 to 60 min) followed by subsequent treatment with oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide resulted in a 30 to 70% decrease in the oxidative modification of PKC. This resulted in a decrease in oxidant-induced conversion of PKC from a Ca2+/lipid-dependent form (peak A) to a Ca2+/lipid-independent form (peak B). This retinoid-mediated protection also was observed with the reversible oxidative modification of PKC induced by m-periodate treatment of intact cells. To understand whether this protection offered by retinoids was caused by a direct influence of retinoids on PKC, experiments were carried out using the purified enzyme. The results of experiments using isolated PKC suggested that retinoids can act directly to protect the regulatory domain of PKC from oxidative modification induced by oxidants. However, high (1-10 microM) concentrations of retinoids are necessary to elicit this protection of isolated PKC. In contrast, in experiments with intact cells, only low (submicromolar) concentrations of retinoids are required to protect PKC from oxidation. The differences noted in the retinoid concentrations required to protect PKC from oxidant modification in the test tube versus in the intact cell may be due to increased retention of retinoids in the cell membrane by partitioning, or to other indirect actions of retinoids in the intact cells to decrease cellular oxidations. These results suggest that some of the anti-tumor promoter actions of retinoids may be mediated, in part, by inhibiting the oxidative modification of protein kinase C induced by oxidant tumor promoters.",

Prognostic factors were homogeneously matched in the two groups. We report on the outcome of group B.;Mean time to first local progression in group B had been 14 months. Tumors originated in the posterior fossa (PF) in 10 children and were supratentorial (ST) in 4; 11 had first been completely excised (NED) and 3 had residual disease (ED). Diagnoses were classic EPD in 9 patients, anaplastic in 5. Eight children were referred NED and 6 ED after two or more operations, 5 had cranial nerve palsy, 1 had recurrent meningitis, and 2 had persistent hydrocephalus. All received radiotherapy (RT) to tumor bed and 5 also had pre-RT chemotherapy. Six of 14 patients (6/10 with PF tumors) had a further relapse a mean 6 months after the last surgery; 4 of 6 died: progression-free survival and overall survival at 4 years after referral were 54.4% and 77%, respectively. Considering only PF tumors and setting time 0 as at the last surgery for group B, progression-free survival and overall survival were 32% and 50% for group B and 52% (p < 0.20)/70% (p < 0.29) for the 46 patients in group A with PF tumors. Local control was 32% in group B and 70.5% in group A (p = 0.02).;Relapsers after surgery only, especially if with PF-EPD, do worse than those treated after first diagnosis; subsequent surgery for tumor relapse has severe neurologic sequelae.",

Increased levels of ACT have been found in serum and brains of AD patients, and ACT has been proposed to regulate beta-amyloid fibril formation in vitro. To gain insight into the regulation of ACT in the brain, we investigated the signal transduction pathways involved in ACT gene expression and protein synthesis in the human astrocytoma cell line U373. This cell line has previously been shown to respond with strong ACT synthesis on stimulation with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha). Here, we describe that both IL-1 beta and TNF alpha activate the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) via production of reactive oxygen intermediates resulting in ACT expression. In addition, we show that neither protein kinase C nor protein kinase A is involved in IL-1 beta- or TNF alpha-induced ACT expression. These results suggest that activation of NF-kappa B may be one possible cause of increased ACT levels in AD and provide a basis for the development of drugs used for the modulation of inflammatory processes occurring in AD.",

Regions of interest were placed manually in tumor regions on MR images, and ADC was calculated with a five-point regression method at b values of 0, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 sec/mm2. ADC values were average values in tumor. All brain tumor subgroups were analyzed. Logistic discriminant analysis was performed by using ADC, age, and patient sex as independent variables to discriminate among tumor groups.;A significant negative correlation existed between ADC and astrocytic tumors of World Health Organization grades 2-4 (grade 2 vs grades 3 and 4, accuracy of 91.3% [P < .01]; grade 3 vs 4, accuracy of 82.4% [P < .01]). ADC of dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNTs) was higher than that of astrocytic grade 2 tumors (accuracy, 100%) and other glioneuronal tumors. ADC of malignant lymphomas was lower than that of glioblastomas and metastatic tumors (accuracy, 83.6%; P < .01). ADC of primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) was lower than that of ependymomas (accuracy, 100%). ADC of meningiomas was lower than that of schwannomas (accuracy, 92.4%; P < .01).

While higher signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is a definite advantage of higher field systems, higher susceptibility effect remains to be a significant trade-off. To take advantage of a higher field system in performing routine clinical images of higher anatomical resolution, we implemented a vector contrast image technique to 3.0T imaging, three-dimensional anisotropy contrast (3DAC), with a PROPELLER (Periodically Rotated Overlapping Parallel Lines with Enhanced Reconstruction) sequence, a method capable of effectively eliminating undesired artifacts on rapid diffusion imaging sequences.;One hundred subjects (20 normal volunteers and 80 volunteers with various central nervous system diseases) participated in the study. Anisotropic diffusion-weighted PROPELLER images were obtained on a General Electric (Waukesha, WI, USA) Signa 3.0T for each axis, with b-value of 1100 sec/mm(2). Subsequently, 3DAC images were constructed using in-house software written on MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).;The vector contrast allows for providing exquisite anatomical detail illustrated by clear identification of all major tracts through the entire brain. 3DAC images provide better anatomical resolution for brainstem glioma than higher-resolution T2 reversed images.

However, the subunit composition of low voltage activated (LVA), or T-type, Ca2+ channels has yet to be elucidated. We have examined whether native calcium channels in NG108-15 mouse neuroblastoma x rat glioma hybrid cells, which express predominantly LVA currents when undifferentiated, are modulated by overexpression of accessory calcium channel subunits. 2. Endogenous alpha 1A, B, C, C, and E, and low levels of beta and alpha 2-delta subunit protein were demonstrated in undifferentiated NG108-15 cells. 3. The alpha 2-delta, beta 2a or beta 1b accessory subunits were overexpressed by transfection of the cDNAs into these cells, and the effect examined on the endogenous Ca2+ channel currents. Heterologous expression, particularly of alpha 2-delta but also of beta 2a subunits clearly affected the profile of these currents. Both subunits induced a sustained component in the currents evoked by depolarizing voltages above -30 mV, and alpha 2-delta additionally caused a depolarization in the voltage dependence of current activation, suggesting that it also affected the native T-type currents. In contrast, beta 1b overexpression had no effect on the endogenous Ca2+ currents, despite immunocytochemical evidence for its expression in the transfected cells. 4 These results suggest that in NG108-15 cells, overexpression of the Ca2+ channel accessory subunits alpha 2-delta and beta 2a induce a sustained component of HVA current, and alpha 2-delta also influences the voltage dependence of activation of the LVA current.

Cells respond to this unique lesion by activating the G2 checkpoint, affected by the Chk1-Cdc25C-cyclin-dependent kinase 1/cyclin B pathway. This study aims at defining DNA damage checkpoint sensors that activate this response to CNDAC, particularly focusing on the major phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like protein kinase family proteins. First, fibroblasts, deficient in ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), transfected with empty vector or repleted with ATM, were arrested in G2 by CNDAC to similar extents, suggesting ATM is not required to activate the G2 checkpoint. Second, chromatin associations of RPA70 and RPA32, subunits of the ssDNA-binding protein, and the ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) substrate Rad17 and its phosphorylated form were increased on CNDAC exposure, suggesting activation of ATR kinase. The G2 checkpoint was abrogated due to depletion of ATR by small interfering RNA, and impaired in ATR-Seckel cells, indicating participation of ATR in this G2 checkpoint pathway. Third, the G2 checkpoint was more stringent in glioma cells with wild-type DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) than those with mutant DNA-PKcs, as shown by mitotic index counting. CNDAC-induced G2 arrest was abrogated by specific DNA-PKcs inhibitors or small interfering RNA knockdown in ML-1 and/or HeLa cells. Finally, two phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like protein kinase inhibitors, caffeine and wortmannin, abolished the CNDAC-induced G2 checkpoint in a spectrum of cell lines. Together, our data showed that ATR and DNA-PK cooperate in CNDAC-induced activation of the G2 checkpoint pathway.",

Different solvent mixtures (methanol and water) and molecular ratios of peptide/oligodeoxynucleotide complexes were tested in order to overcome the problems related to solubility. Optimal conditions for both spectroscopic and cellular experiments were obtained with the molecular ratio peptide/oligodeoxynucleotide equal to 21:4, corresponding to a 7:5 ratio for their respective +/- charge ratio. At the molecular level, CD and Raman spectra were consistent with a alpha-helix conformation of the peptide in water or in a methanol-water mixture. The presence of methanol increased considerably the solubility of the peptide without altering its alpha-helix conformation, as evidenced by CD and Raman spectroscopies. UV absorption melting profile of the oligodeoxynucleotide gave rise to a flat melting profile, corresponding to its random structure in solution. Raman spectra of oligodeoxynucleotide/peptide complexes could only be studied in methanol/water mixture solutions. Drastic changes observed in Raman spectra have undoubtedly shown: (a) the perturbation occurred in the peptide secondary structure, and (b) possible interaction between the lysine residues of the peptide and the oligodeoxynucleotide. At the cellular level, the complex was prepared in a mixture of 10% methanol and 90% cell medium.

However, little is known regard to the mechanism of polydatin's neuroprotection in ischemic stroke. We therefore investigated the potential neuroprotective effects of polydatin and explored the underlying mechanisms. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Experiment 1 was used to evaluate the expression of glioma-associated oncogene homolog1 (Gli1), Patched-1 (Ptch1) and Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) after pMCAO, six time points were included. Experiment 2 was used to detect polydatin's neuroprotection after pMCAO. Neurological deficit, brain water content and infarct size were measured at 24h and 72 h after pMCAO. Immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western Blotting, activity assay and confocal microscope were used to analyse the expression of Gli1, Ptch1, SOD1 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). Experiment 3 was used to detect polydatin's influence on blood-brain barrier (BBB). Compared with Sham group, the expression of Gli1, Ptch1 and SOD1 were up-regulated shortly after pMCAO (P<0.05). Compared with Vehicle group, high dose of polydatin (50mg/kg) up-regulated Gli1, Ptch1, SOD1 and down-regulated NF-κB, and reduced infarct volume, brain water content and behavioral deficits (P<0.05). Meanwhile, BBB permeability was also ameliorated. The results indicated that polydatin protected the brain from damage caused by pMCAO, and this effect may be through up-regulating the expression of Gli1, Ptch1 and SOD1 and down-regulating the expression of NF-κB, and ameliorating BBB permeability.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Brain tumours fall into 3 major categories: a) secondary tumours which have originated in distant parts of the body, b) meningiomas, which generally grow on, rather than in, the substance of the brain and c) intrinsic tumours which are generally composed of neoplastic glial cells. Secondary tumours show a marked propensity for metastasis to, and growth in, the brain; up to 24% of cancers are thought to metastasize to the brain. These metastatic deposits are frequently multiple but are usually well circumscribed lesions. Meningiomas are usually benign lesions which grow by expansion and seeding along the leptomeninges on the surface of the brain. Such tumours may, however, recur and show some degree of invasion of the underlying cerebral cortex. The most common form of brain tumour is the glioma, of which there are various histological types. These tumours generally fail to metastasize out of the nervous system. Two plausable explanations for this failure have been recently proposed. Firstly, the vascular basal laminae of the brain appears to exclude intravasation of neoplastic glia and secondly, if such cells do enter the vascular system they are prevented from binding to the endothelial cells of \"target\" organs by virtue of a lack of appropriate cell adhesion molecules, including CD 15. While intrinsic glial tumours fail to metastasize they are, however, characterised by diffuse local invasion of the normal nervous tissues. This important biological feature hampers all current therapeutic approaches. Local invasion is a multi-faceted phenomenon of interactive mechanisms including cell motility, adhesion and enzymic remodelling of the extracellular matrix components and involves paracrine interaction between normal and neoplastic cellular elements.",

We examined the interaction of nuclear proteins prepared from different cell lines with the JCV regulatory region by DNA binding gel retardation assays. Binding was detected with nuclear extracts prepared from human fetal glial cells, glioma cells, and HeLa cells. Little or no binding was detected with nuclear extracts prepared from human embryonic kidney cells. Competitive binding assays suggest that the nuclear factor(s) which interacted with the JCV regulatory region was different from those which interacted with the regulatory region of the closely related polyomavirus SV40. We found three areas in the JCV regulatory region protected from DNase I digestion: site A, located just upstream from the TATA sequence in the first 98-base pair (bp) repeat; site B, located upstream from the TATA sequence in the second 98-bp repeat; and site C, located just following the second 98-bp repeat. There were some differences in the ability of the nuclear factor(s) from the two brain cell lines and HeLa cells to completely protect the nucleotides within the footprint region. The results from the DNase I protective studies and competitive DNA binding studies with specific oligonucleotides, suggest that nuclear factor-1 or a nuclear factor-1-like factor is interacting with all three sites in the JCV regulatory region. In addition, the results suggest that the nuclear factor which interacts with the JCV regulatory region from human brain cell lines is different from the factor found in HeLa cells.",

To establish our overall understanding of possible in vivo relationships between DNA repair polymorphisms and the development of cancer, we performed a literature review of epidemiological studies that assessed associations between such polymorphisms and risk of cancer. Thirty studies of polymorphisms in OGG1, XRCC1, ERCC1, XPC, XPD, XPF, BRCA2, and XRCC3 were identified in the April 30, 2002 MEDLINE database (National Center for Biotechnology Information. PubMed Database: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez). These studies focused on adult glioma, bladder cancer, breast cancer, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer (melanoma and nonmelanoma), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and stomach cancer. We found that a small proportion of the published studies were large and population-based. Nonetheless, published data were consistent with associations between: (a) the OGG1 S326C variant and increased risk of various types of cancer; (b) the XRCC1 R194W variant and reduced risk of various types of cancer; and (c) the BRCA2 N372H variant and increased risk of breast cancer. Suggestive results were seen for polymorphisms in other genes; however, small sample sizes may have contributed to false-positive or false-negative findings. We conclude that large, well-designed studies of common polymorphisms in DNA repair genes are needed. Such studies may benefit from analysis of multiple genes or polymorphisms and from the consideration of relevant exposures that may influence the likelihood of cancer in the presence of reduced DNA repair capacity.",

A cDNA of 5566 bases was obtained from overlapping clones and encoded a protein of 1116 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 123.6 kDa. Over its full length, the amino acid sequence of KCC2 is 67% identical to the widely distributed K-Cl cotransporter isoform (KCC1) identified in rat brain and rabbit kidney (Gillen, C., Brill, S., Payne, J.A., and Forbush, B., III(1996) J.

Based on analysis of the primary structure as well as homology with other cation-chloride cotransporters, we predict 12 transmembrane segments bounded by N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic regions. Four sites for N-linked glycosylation are predicted on an extracellular intermembrane loop between putative transmembrane segments 5 and 6. Northern blot analysis using a KCC2-specific cDNA probe revealed a very highly expressed approximately5.6-kilobase transcript only in brain. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed that KCC1 was present in rat primary astrocytes and rat C6 glioma cells but that KCC2 was completely absent from these cells, suggesting KCC2 was not of glial cell origin. In situ hybridization studies demonstrated that the KCC2 transcript was expressed at high levels in neurons throughout the central nervous system, including CA1-CA4 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, granular cells and Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum, and many groups of neurons throughout the brainstem.",

GB and MCL chemotherapy gives very modest results, the vast majority of patients experience recurrent disease. To find out the new treatment modality for drug-resistant GB and MCL cells, combining of bradykinin (BK) antagonists with conventional temozolomide (TMZ) treatment, and screening of thiazolidinones derivatives were the main objectives of this work. As it was revealed here, BKM-570 was the lead compound among BK antagonists under investigation (IC50 was 3.3 μM) in human GB cells. It strongly suppressed extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation. BK antagonists did not decrease the viability of MCL cells, thus showing the cell-specific mode, while thiazolidinone derivatives, a novel group of promising anti-tumour compounds inhibited proliferation of MCL cells: IC₅₀ of ID 4526 and ID 4527 compounds were 0.27 μM and 0.16 μM, correspondingly. However, single agents are often not effective in clinic due to activation of collateral pathways in tumour cells. We demonstrated a strong synergistic effect after combinatorial treatment by BKM-570 together with TMZ that drastically increased cytotoxic action of this drug in rat and human glioma cells. Small proportion of cells was still viable after such treatment that could be explained by presence of TMZ-resistant cells in the population. It is possible to expect that the combined therapy aimed simultaneously at different elements of tumourigenesis will be more effective with lower drug concentrations than the first-line drug temozolomide used alone in clinics.",

Individual tumor cells could be identified from the optic nerve to spinal cord, documenting the \"whole-brain\" nature of the disease. CD20 immunostaining was necessary to fully appreciate the extent of individual lymphoma cell percolation through the white matter.

A superluminescent diode (SLD) with a peak emission wavelength (lambda = 820 nm) that is the near-infrared absorption band of the oxidized form of CytOx was employed. The attenuation coefficient was obtained from the depth-resolved reflectance profiles of liquid phantoms (naphthol green B with intralipid), explant culture (periosteum of calvaria from rats) and cells in 3D agarose constructs. The absorption coefficient of naphthol green B can be accurately quantified by the linear relationship between attenuation coefficients and the concentration. The difference in the attenuation coefficient of astrocytoma cells in agarose before and after reduction of CytOx is 0.26 +/- 0.10 mm(-1) ( n = 9), whereas no attenuation is observed with the agarose control. Reduction of the enzyme in periosteal tissue leads to a change in attenuation coefficient of 0.43 +/- 0.24 mm(-1) ( n = 7). For comparison, using a biochemical assay, the absorption coefficient of the oxidized-reduced form of CytOx is measured at approximately 8.3 +/- 1.5x10(-3) mm-1 ( n = 4) and 8.7 +/-2.5x10(-3) mm-1 ( n = 4) at 820 nm for astrocytoma cells and rat periosteum, respectively. The lower value of CytOx concentration using biochemical versus OCT measurements may result from shifts in the scattering profile and the amplifying influences of multiple heme-based oxidases, indicating that conventional OCT is not specific enough to monitor redox changes in cytochrome oxidase. However, qualitative shifts in oxidation state are apparent using the technique. Our results suggest the potential application of OCT in providing high-resolution tomographic imaging of tissues in organ culture and cells grown in three-dimensional constructs in vitro.",

The recent demonstration that Hermes, a glycoprotein implicated in the adhesion of lymphocytes to endothelium, belongs to the CD44 cluster raises interesting questions concerning the role of this molecule on astrocytes and on non-lymphoid cells. To obtain confirmation of the identity of p85 glycoprotein and CD44, p85 glycoprotein was purified from B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by affinity to monolonal 50B4-IgG and electrophoretic elution, digested with trypsin or CNBr and fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC. The sequences of three peptides were obtained which could be aligned with the amino acid sequence deduced from the CD44 cDNA at residues 49-54, 59-66 and 309-323. These constitute the first reported peptide sequences for antigens of the CD44 cluster and confirm that p85 glycoprotein is indeed the product of the CD44 gene. Since two different cDNA clones encoding molecules with cytoplasmic tails of 72 and 5 amino acids have been isolated, the isolation of peptide 309-323 confirms the existence of a processed protein with the longer cytoplasmic domain. Using a cDNA probe, we have characterized the expression of CD44 in several normal and malignant cell types. The level of CD44 mRNA was correlated with the surface expression of CD44 antigens (50B4) in several leukemic cell lines, in astrocytoma lines and in normal granulocytes. Negative cells included the Y79 retinoblastoma line, the NALM-6 leukemic line and endothelial cells. Identical mRNA species of 5.0, 2.3 and 1.7 kb were present in all CD44-positive samples, including normal granulocytes, astrocytoma, melanoma and leukemia cell lines and leukemic cells from patients. The highest level of expression of CD44 was observed on astrocytoma lines and on acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells of immature phenotype. The presence of high levels of CD44 on malignant cells could increase the ability of these cells to adhere to matrix proteins and/or to interact with endothelium, thus potentially altering their capacity for invasiveness and metastasis.",

The protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) is an enzyme that recognizes and repairs the abnormal L-isoaspartyl residues in proteins. Recently, we reported that PIMT expression was stimulated by the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid and that this was mediated through the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)/beta-catenin pathway. In this study, to gain further insights into which of the signaling pathways activated by valproic acid regulate PIMT abundance, astrocytoma U-87 MG and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with this drug to investigate the possible involvement of the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in PIMT induction. Valproic acid increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation on Thr202/Tyr204 and Thr185/Tyr187, respectively. Pharmacological inhibitors against the kinases Src, c-Raf, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 abolished the ERK1/2 phosphorylation stimulated by valproic acid, thus preventing PIMT induction by the drug. Furthermore, MEK1/2 inhibition with U0126 blocked the higher phosphorylation of RSK-1 on Thr359/Ser363 and of GSK-3beta on Ser9 as well as the increased expression of RSK-1, beta-catenin and PIMT upon treatment with valproic acid. RSK-1 knockdown by interfering RNA abrogated the increased expression of RSK-1, beta-catenin and PIMT as well as the induced phosphorylation of RSK-1 and GSK-3beta due to valproic acid. Thus, our findings demonstrated that PIMT up-regulation by valproic acid required the activation of the ERK signaling pathway including RSK-1 the latter being responsible for inactivating GSK-3 and subsequently leading to beta-catenin stabilization.",

The cDNA-oligoarray analysis and reverse transcription-PCR verification indicated common changes in gene expression in methionine-dependent cell lines to include up-regulation/induction of cyclin D1, mitotic arrest deficient (MAD)1, p21, growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible (GADD)45 alpha, GADD45 gamma, GADD34, breast cancer (BRCA)1, 14-3-3sigma, B-cell CLL/lymphoma (BCL)1, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, TGF-beta-induced early response (TIEG), SMAD5, SMAD7, SMAD2, insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP7), IGF-R2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R)2, TNFR-related death receptor (DR)6, TRAF interacting protein (I-TRAF), IL-6, MDA7, IL-1B convertase (ICE)-gamma, delta and epsilon, IRF1, IRF5, IRF7, interferon (IFN)-gamma and receptor components, ISG15, p65-NF-kappaB, JUN-B, positive cofactor (PC)4, C/ERB-beta, inositol triphosphate receptor I, and methionine adenosyltransferase II. On the other hand, cyclins A1, A2, B1 and B2, cell division cycle (CDC)2 and its kinase, CDC25 A and B, budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles (BUB)1 and 3, MAD2, CDC28 protein kinase (CKS)1 and 2, neuroepithelial cell transforming gene (NET)1, activator of S-phase kinase (ASK), CDC14B phosphatase, BCL2, TGF-beta activated kinase (TAK)1, TAB1, c-FOS, DNA topoisomerase II, DNA polymerase alpha, dihydrofolate reductase, thymidine kinase, stathmin, and MAP4 were down-regulated. In the methionine stress-resistant SWB77, only 20% of the above genes were affected, and then only to a lesser extent. In addition, some of the changes observed in SWB77 were opposite to those seen in methionine-dependent tumors, including expression of p21, TRAIL-R2, and TIEG. Despite similarities, differences between methionine-dependent tumors were substantial, especially in regard to regulation of cytokine expression. Western blot analysis confirmed that methionine stress caused the following: (a) a marked increase of GADD45alpha and gamma in the wt-p53 cell lines SWB61 and 40; (b) an increase in GADD34 and p21 protein in all of the methionine-dependent lines; and (c) the induction of MDA7 and phospho-p38 in DAOY and SWB39, consistent with marked transcriptional activation of the former under methionine stress. It was additionally shown that methionine stress down-regulated the highly active phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase pathway by reducing AKT phosphorylation, especially in DAOY and SWB77, and also reduced the levels of retinoblastoma (Rb) and pRb (P-ser780, P-ser795, and P-ser807/811), resulting in a shift in favor of unphosphorylated species in all of the methionine-dependent lines. Immunohistochemical analysis showed marked inhibition of nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappaB under methionine stress in methionine-dependent lines.

        "Doc_abstract":"Fifty-three patients with advanced Hodgkin's disease, most of them previously treated, received 8 to 16 courses of modified MOPP regimens (nitrogen mustard replaced by trichlormethine in arm A, with addition of vinblastine to the 4-drug regimen in arm B, and alternation of three drugs--trichlormethine, vincristine, and prednisone--with probably non-cross resistant two drugs--vinblastine and procarbazine in arm C). Thirty patients (57%) achieved complete remission. Higher complete remission rate and longer survival was recorded in patients treated with 5-drug regimens (arms B and C) as compared to the 4-drug regimen (arm A), but the differences were not significant. Higher complete remission rates were observed in asymptomatic patients, females, and patients with lymphocyte predominance and nodular sclerosis subtypes of Hodgkin's disease. Besides expected short-term toxicity, 4 out of 30 complete responders developed secondary malignancies (two acute myeloblastic leukemias, one hepatocellular carcinoma, and one cerebellar astrocytoma). Several other patients had serious toxicity which could be attributed to chemotherapy. Twenty-eight percent of the patients has been alive 15 to 18 years since the start of this study.",
