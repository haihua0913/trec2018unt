        "Doc_abstract":"In human Ph-positive leukemia there is a clear association of different forms of the BCR-ABL oncogene with distinct types of leukemia. The P190 form of BCR-ABL is rarely observed in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) but is present in 50% of Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In contrast, the P210 form is observed both in CML and 50% of Ph-positive ALL. Methylation of the proximal promoter of the ABL1 gene has been shown to be a nearly universal event associated with clinical progression of CML. This raises the question of whether methylation of the ABL1 promoter is an epigenetic modification also associated with Ph-positive ALL. To study this issue, we used methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing to determine the methylation status of the ABL1 promoter in 18 Ph-positive ALL samples. We report here that gene-specific ABL1 promoter methylation is associated mainly with the P210 form of BCR-ABL and not the P190 form. While six out of the seven P210-positive ALL samples had ABL1 promoter methylation, none of the 11 P190-positive ALL samples demonstrated ABL1 promoter methylation. In addition, we estimated the extent and relative abundance of ABL1 promoter methylation in several Ph-positive ALL samples and compared it to the methylation pattern in chronic, accelerated and blastic crisis phases of CML. We put forth a model that correlates the different types of leukemias with the different levels of ABL1 promoter methylation.",

It is licensed for the first- and second-line treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and second-line treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia on the basis of BCR-ABL inhibition, but the activity of dasatinib against additional molecular targets may enable treatment of other hematologic disorders. Potential targets for dasatinib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) include Lyn (a Src family kinase), ABL, and the associated CD40 pathway. Although dasatinib monotherapy has modest clinical activity in CLL, ongoing studies are evaluating combination treatment. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), FLT3, Lyn, c-Kit, and BCR-ABL are expressed in a subpopulation of patients. To date, clinical responses to dasatinib in patients with unselected AML have been mixed and larger studies are needed, particularly correlating clinical response to molecular markers. Imatinib has been used successfully to treat patients with chronic eosinophilic disorders with the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion kinase; limited clinical data indicate that dasatinib could be active in imatinib-resistant disease. Ongoing clinical studies should further define the value of dasatinib in these disorders.",

        "Doc_abstract":"ABL1 amplification, due to a cryptic episomal translocation NUP214/ABL1, is a novel finding in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here we report on the incidence and clinical features of this genetic defect in a series of 30 consecutive adult T-cell ALL patients. Multiple copies of the ABL1 gene were detected in two patients (6.6%), one with the karyotype 46,XY,t(1;3)(p36;p21),del(6)(q23)/46,XY and the other without analyzable metaphases. Metaphase/interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detected multiple uncountable signals corresponding to ABL1 in mitotic cells and nuclei from both patients. In one patient, no signals corresponded with the 9p21 chromosomal region, which contains the p16INK4a gene, and in the other one signal was observed. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated that in these patients ABL1 gene expression was 14- and 18-fold greater than in normal controls, and returned to normal levels only when complete remission was achieved. We reached the following conclusions: (1) FISH is the only technique that promptly identifies T-cell ALL patients with ABL1 amplification, (2) quick identification with FISH is fundamental in the clinic because this T-cell ALL subset is imatinib sensitive but may become resistant due to development of additional mutations, and (3) ABL1 quantitative RT-PCR may be easily applied to monitor minimal residual disease.",

A minimum dose (200 mg) required for effective BCR-ABL inhibition in imatinib resistant/intolerant leukemia was determined. The pre-clinical activity profile of nilotinib against mutant BCR-ABL was largely confirmed. Substantial differences between peripheral blood baseline pCRKL/CRKL ratios were observed when comparing chronic myeloid leukemia with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Finally, rapid BCR-ABL-reactivation shortly after starting nilotinib treatment was seen in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with progressive disease carrying the P-loop mutations Y253H, E255K, or mutation T315I.

In K562 leukemia cells, overexpression of miR-30a reduced ABL1 and BCR-ABL1 protein expression, decreased proliferation, and arrested cell cycle progression between G1 and S.

        "Doc_abstract":"Advances in the molecular characterization of leukemic cells have greatly improved the precision of diagnosis and treatment assignment as well as the monitoring of residual disease in both acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. Currently, specific genetic rearrangements can be identified in as many as 50% of children with either acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. The genes p16 (or MTS1) and TEL/AML1 are now respectively recognized as the most common tumor suppressor and fusion genes in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Increasingly, contemporary protocols for the acute leukemias are relying on genetic information to guide treatment decisions. Examples include the use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the BCR-ABL fusion gene or MLL rearrangement, and for acute myeloid leukemia with monosomy 7; antimetabolite-based therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases with hyperdiploidy of more than 50 chromosomes (DNA index > or = 1.16); and retinoic acid and anthracycline-containing regimens for the acute promyelocytic acute myeloid leukemia subtype with PML-RARA fusion. Other efforts are being made to reduce the long-term sequelae of treatment. Indeed, extended intrathecal therapy and intensive systemic chemotherapy will, in all likelihood, replace cranial irradiation as subclinical central nervous system therapy for patients with intermediate-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and perhaps even for those with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The challenge now is to identify specific treatments for other genetically defined subtypes of leukemia.

Therefore, we have established a one-tube multiplex RT-PCR for the detection of common BCR-ABL fusion transcripts (b2a2, b3a2, e1a2) in routinely processed tissues and bone marrow trephines with respect to the inevitable fragmentation of ribonucleic acids in these specimens.

Human K562 chronic myeloid leukemia and SUP B-15 Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines were used as positive controls for p210 and p190 BCR-ABL mRNAs, respectively. HL60 cell line was used as a negative control. After the leukemia cells were fixed and permeabilized, without extracting nucleic acids, the mRNAs were reverse transcribed to cDNAs, and the cDNAs were amplified by multiplex polymerase chain reaction with fluorescent primers specific for p190 and p210 BCR-ABL mRNAs. After transfer onto glass slides by cytospin, the amplified cells were detected by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence microscopy after propidium iodide or 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindone counterstaining showed that the positive K562 cells exhibited a yellow-green fluorescent cytoplasm around a red nucleus, and that the positive SUP B-15 cells exhibited an orange cytoplasm around a blue nucleus. Only the red or blue nucleus was visible in respective negative HL60 cells. The specificity of amplification was confirmed by the absence of a signal when control experiments were performed either with RNase digestion of mRNA or without reverse transcriptase/Taq polymerase. We conclude that the multiplex in-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method is capable of simultaneously detecting and differentiating the p210 and p190 BCR-ABL mRNAs of chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, and that it may be useful in quantitatively monitoring the minimal residual disease during therapy.",

Since these proteins are only expressed in Ph1 positive cells, they are per definition tumor-specific. In this report we describe the reactivity of polyvalent antisera raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the tumor-specific bcr-abl junctions. Native chimeric proteins were specifically recognized by these junction-specific antisera. Therefore we conclude that the bcr-abl junctions are antigenically exposed on the chimeric proteins.

Specific abnormalities are correlated with clinical phenotype, although some are broad and encompass several World Health Organization-defined entities. TKs are excellent drug targets as exemplified by the activity of imatinib in BCR-ABL1-positive disease, particularly chronic myeloid leukemia. Resistance to imatinib is seen in a minority of cases and is often associated with the appearance of secondary point mutations within the TK domain of BCR-ABL1. These mutations are highly variable in their sensitivity to increased doses of imatinib or alternative TK inhibitors such as nilotinib or dasatinib.

        "Doc_abstract":"Tyrosine kinases are commonly mutated and activated in both acute and chronic myeloid leukemias. Here, we review the functions, signaling activities, mechanism of transformation, and therapeutic targeting of two prototypic tyrosine kinase oncogenes, BCR-ABL and FLT3, associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), respectively. BCR-ABL is generated by the Philadelphia chromosome translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, creating a chimeric oncogene in which the BCR and c-ABL genes are fused. The product of this oncogene, BCR-ABL, has elevated ABL tyrosine kinase activity and transforms hematopoietic cells by exerting a wide variety of biological effects, including reduction in growth factor dependence, enhanced viability, and altered adhesion of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) cells. Elevated tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL is critical for activating downstream signalling cascades and for all aspects of transformation, explaining the remarkable clinical efficacy of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate (STI571). By comparison, FLT3 is mutated in about one third of all cases of AML, most often through a mechanism that involves an internal tandem duplication (ITD) of a small number of amino acid residues in the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor. As is the case for BCR-ABL, these mutations activate the kinase activity constitutively, activate multiple signaling pathways, and result in an augmentation of proliferation and viability. Transformation by FLT3-ITD can readily be observed in murine models, and FLT3 cooperates with other types of oncogenes to create a fully transformed acute leukemia. FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials and may be very useful therapeutic agents in AML.",

It results in juxtaposition of the 5' part of the BCR gene on chromosome 22 to the 3' part of the ABL1 gene (previously ABL) on chromosome 9. CML is clinically characterized by three distinct phases: chronic, accelerated, and blast phase. Blast crisis is characterized by the rapid expansion of a population of differentiation arrested blast cells (myeloid or lymphoid cells population), with secondary chromosomal abnormalities present. We report a case of myeloid blast crisis of CML resistant to imatinib mesylate and chemotherapy. By use of cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and comparative genomic hybridization methods, we identified a cluster of BCR-ABL amplification on inverted duplication of the Ph chromosome with t(3;21)(q26;q22) and increased genomic levels of the RUNX1 gene (previously AML1). The t(3;21)(q26;q22) is a recurrent chromosomal abnormality in some cases of CML blast phase and in treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. Amplification or copy number increase of RUNX1 has been reported in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our study indicated that the progenitor of CML was BCR-ABL dependent through the amplification of Ph chromosome as a mechanism of resistance to imatinib therapy. The coexistence of BCR-ABL and t(3;21)(q26;q22) with RUNX1 rearrangement might play a pivotal role in the CML blast transformation.",

A new retroviral vector was used to introduce the genes into the factor-dependent myeloid line FDC-P1.

Dysregulation or aberrant activation of such cascades can lead to inappropriate cell survival and abnormal cell proliferation in leukemia. Successful treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the BCR-ABL fusion gene is a prime example of effectively inhibiting intracellular signaling cascades. However, even in these patients resistance can develop via emergence of mutations or feedback activation of other pathways that cause refractory disease. Constitutive activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway has been observed in different types of leukemia, including CML, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Abnormal mTOR activity may contribute to chemotherapy resistance, while it may also be effectively targeted via molecular means and/or development of specific pharmacological inhibitors. This review discusses the role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR dysre-gulation in leukemia and summarizes the emergence of preliminary data for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. J. Cell.

In chronic myeloid leukemia, changes in the methylation status of the CpG-rich islands at several sites in the proximal ABL1 promoter (Pa) on the Philadelphia (Ph)-chromosome have been observed. It remains unclear if the Pa methylation precedes the translocation event (t9;22) that generates the Ph-chromosome or if Pa methylation is a stochastic event in a progenitor cell which will later acquire other mutations, namely t9;22. The present study was conducted to answer two questions: What is the methylation status of Pa in patients with Ph-negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPD)? Can the study of methylation in patients with Ph-negative MPD shed light on the initial events associated with the translocation? To probe CpG methylation, we used two methodologies; site-methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme assay and methylation-specific PCR analysis following modification of genomic DNA by bisulfite. Results showed that 22 of the 97 patients with Ph-negative MPD expressed BCR-ABL transcripts. Seven of the 97 patients possessed methylated Pa, but only 2 of them expressed BCR-ABL transcripts. In some of the patients, Pa methylation was a dynamic event. In conclusion, aberrant methylation in Ph-negative MPD could be an initial event triggering the occurrence of the t9;22 translocation and its clinical expression. These findings may shed light on the pathogenesis and progression of MPD.",

Imatinib is highly effective at treating human Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase but not Ph(+) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and CML blast crisis. We find that SRC kinases activated by BCR-ABL remain fully active in imatinib-treated mouse leukemic cells, suggesting that imatinib does not inactivate all BCR-ABL-activated signaling pathways. This SRC pathway is essential for leukemic cells to survive imatinib treatment and for CML transition to lymphoid blast crisis. Inhibition of both SRC and BCR-ABL kinase activities by dasatinib affords complete B-ALL remission. However, curing B-ALL and CML mice requires killing leukemic stem cells insensitive to both imatinib and dasatinib.

Treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib is currently standard for chronic myelogenous leukemia, which is also caused by Bcr/Abl. However, Imatinib has shown limited efficacy for treating Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In our study, we have investigated the effect of Imatinib therapy on murine P190 Bcr/Abl lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Three of four cultures were very sensitive to treatment with 5 mumol/L Imatinib. Significant cell death also initially occurred when the same cultures were treated in the presence of stromal support. However, after 6 days, remaining cells started to proliferate vigorously. The Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase present in the cells that were now able to multiply in the presence of 5 mumol/L Imatinib was still inhibited by the drug. In concordance with this, the Abl ATP-binding pocket domain of Bcr/Abl in the resistant cells did not contain point mutations which would make the protein Imatinib resistant. The effect of stroma in selecting Imatinib-resistant lymphoblasts did not require direct cell-cell contact. SDF-1alpha could substitute for the presence of stromal cells. Our results show that stroma selects Imatinib-resistant Bcr/Abl P190 lymphoblasts that are less dependent on Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase activity. Therefore, therapy for Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, aimed at interfering with the protective effect of stroma in combination with Imatinib, could be of benefit for the eradication of the leukemic cells.",

However, a substantial number of patients are either primarily refractory or acquire resistance to imatinib. While a number of mechanisms are known to confer resistance to imatinib, increasing evidence has demonstrated a role for BCR-ABL-independent pathways. The Src-family kinases (SFKs) are one such pathway and have been implicated in imatinib resistance. Additionally, these kinases are key to the progression of CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). The dual SFK/BCR-ABL inhibitor dasatinib is now clinically available and has markedly greater potency compared with imatinib against native BCR-ABL and the majority of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants. Therefore, this agent, as well as other dual SFK/BCR-ABL inhibitors under development, could provide added therapeutic advantages by overcoming both BCR-ABL-dependent (i.e. BCR-ABL mutations) and -independent forms of imatinib resistance and delaying transition to advanced phase disease. In this review, we discuss the preclinical and clinical evidence demonstrating the involvement of SFKs in imatinib resistance and the progression of CML and Ph+ ALL, as well as the potential role of dual SFK/BCR-ABL inhibition in the management of these diseases.",

The discovery of BCR-ABL point mutations has been a great asset to furthering our understanding of a major cause of drug resistance, as has discovery of multidrug resistance proteins, dysregulation of signaling molecules downstream of BCR-ABL, and insights into the underlying causes of stromal-mediated chemoresistance. Such elucidation of mechanisms of resistance associated with leukemic cell survival is essential for the optimization of current therapies and enhancement of patient survival via delaying or preventing disease recurrence. Here, we present an overview of the use of nilotinib in combination with other agents against BCR-ABL-positive leukemia, as well as solid tumors, for the purpose of increasing clinical efficacy and overriding drug resistance.

In recent years, pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia clinical trials have used discontinuous rather than continuous dosing of dexamethasone in an effort to reduce the incidence of osteonecrosis. However, it is not known whether discontinuous dosing would compromise antileukemic efficacy of glucocorticoids. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of discontinuous dexamethasone against continuous dexamethasone in murine models bearing human acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts (n = 8 patient samples) or murine BCR-ABL+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Plasma dexamethasone concentrations (7.9 to 212 nM) were similar to those achieved in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia using conventional dosages. The median leukemia-free survival ranged from 16 to 59 days; dexamethasone prolonged survival from a median of 4 to 129 days in all seven dexamethasone-sensitive acute lymphoblastic leukemias. In the majority of cases (7 of 8 xenografts and the murine BCR-ABL model) we demonstrated equal efficacy of the two dexamethasone dosing regimens; whereas for one acute lymphoblastic leukemia sample, the discontinuous regimen yielded inferior antileukemic efficacy (log-rank p = 0.002). Our results support the clinical practice of using discontinuous rather than continuous dexamethasone dosing in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. ",

In contrast, a significant fraction of healthy humans have been found to have BCR/ABL-positive hematopoietic cells. To bridge the gap between the information derived from current mouse models and nonleukemic humans with the BCR/ABL oncogene, we generated a knockin model with BCR/ABL p210 expressed from the Bcr locus. Unlike previous models, expression of BCR/ABL from the knockin allele did not induce leukemia. BCR/ABL mutant cells did exhibit favorable bone marrow engraftment compared to control cells. These data suggest that BCR/ABL expression alone is insufficient to induce disease.

At the molecular level, the t(9;22) leads to the fusion of the BCR gene (on chromosome 22) to the ABL gene (translocated from chromosome 9); this fusion gene BCR-ABL with its elevated tyrosine kinase activity must to be central to the pathogenesis of these disorders. Three different breakpoint cluster regions are discerned within the BCR gene on chromosome 22: M-bcr, m-bcr, and mu-bcr. Ph + leukemia cell lines are important tools in this research area. More than 20 ALL-and more than 40 CML-derived Ph + leukemia cell lines have been described. Furthermore, three Ph + B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, established from patients with Ph + ALL or CML, are available. Molecular analysis has documented BCR-ABL fusion genes in three apparently Ph chromosome-negative cell lines, all three derived from CML. Nearly all Ph + ALL cell lines have the m-bcr e1-a2 fusion gene (only two ALL cell lines have a b3-a2 fusion) whereas all CML cell lines, but one carry the M-bcr b2-a2, b3-a2 or both hybrids. The mu-bcr e19-a2 has been detected in one CML cell line. Four cell lines display a three-way translocation involving chromosomes 9, 22 and a third chromosome. Additional Ph chromosomes (up to five) have been found in four Ph + ALL cell lines and in 18 CML cell lines; though in some cell lines the extra Ph chromosome(s) might be caused by the polyploidy (tri- and tetraploidy) of the cells. Another modus to acquire additional copies of the BCR-ABL fusion gene is the formation of tandem repeats of the BCR-ABL hybrid as seen in CML cell line K-562. Both mechanisms, selective multiplication of the der(22) chromosome and tandem replication of the fusion gene BCR-ABL, presumably lead to enhanced levels of the fusion protein and its tyrosine kinase activity (genetic dosage effect). The availability of a panel of Ph + cell lines as highly informative leukemia models offers the unique opportunity to analyze the pathobiology of these malignancies and the role of the Ph chromosome in leukemogenesis.",

RNA-Seq technology, with an average coverage of ~30‑fold, was used to detect gene fusion events in a patient with a 6-year history of CML, identified to be in the chronic phase of the disease. Using deFuse and TopHat‑fusion programs with improved filtering methods, we identified two reliable gene fusions in a blood sample obtained from the CML patient, including extremely low expression levels of the classic BCR‑ABL1 gene fusion. In addition, a novel gene fusion involving the ring finger protein 213 (RNF213)-solute carrier family 26, member 11 (SLC26A11) was identified and validated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Further bioinformatic analysis revealed that specific domains of SLC26A11 were damaged, which may affect the function of sulfate transportation of the normal gene.

To evaluate the accuracy of this new technique, we tested 70 patients with hematological diseases using the CBA system, cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). Most of the results obtained by the CBA system were concordant with those by cytogenetic analysis, FISH and RQ-PCR. In the CBA system, dilution experiments with positive control samples revealed sensitivities of at least 1%. The statistical analysis revealed that the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of the BCR-ABL fusion proteins from mononuclear cells (MNCs) were higher than those from WBC or BM samples. The MFI values of cells were not dramatically reduced after 24 hours of storage at room temperature. The CBA technique detected all types of BCR-ABL proteins in leukemic cells with high specificity and sensitivity.

Also, the relevance of Pa promoter methylation to BCR-ABL expression in CML is unclear. We examined methylation of the ABL Pa promoter in uncultured BM samples and in colonies derived from their hematopoietic precursor cells by bisulfite and PCR-based assays (combined bisulfite restriction analysis and methylation-specific PCR). BM from seven CP CML patients at diagnosis had about 20-60% of the copies of the ABL Pa promoter methylated. No Pa methylation was detected in normal BMs or colonies derived from them. In contrast, most colonies from CP CML patients had Pa methylation. Surprisingly, 18-49% of the CML-derived colonies with this methylation reproducibly had no detectable BCR-ABL RNA on nested reverse transcription-PCR. Furthermore, the percentage of BCR-ABL RNA-positive colonies was almost same among the colonies not displaying Pa methylation as among the colonies in which this methylation was found. We conclude that ABL Pa methylation is often an early marker of CML in hematopoietic precursors and in total mononuclear BM cells but that it is not associated with an increased frequency of BCR-ABL RNA-positive cells.

Discovery of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein as the molecular abnormality causing chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) paved the way for the development of a targeted anticancer therapy. The substantial activity of imatinib mesylate (STI571, Glivec) in CML and Philadelphia (Ph)-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) changed the therapeutic approach to Ph+ leukemia and rang the bell for a new era of anticancer treatment. However, when the phenomenon of relapse occurred despite continued imatinib treatment, we had to learn the lesson that imatinib can select for a resistant disease clone. If such a clone still depends on Bcr-Abl, it either carries a BCR-ABL point mutation that prevents binding of the drug or expresses the fusion protein at high levels. Alternatively, leukemia cells that harbor secondary genetic alterations resulting in Bcr-Abl-independent proliferation are selected for their growth advantage in the presence of imatinib. Point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain prevent binding of imatinib but still allow binding of ATP, thus retaining Bcr-Abl kinase activity. Mutated BCR-ABL is frequently detected in cases of imatinib-resistant Ph+ leukemia and therefore represents the main challenge for the investigation of alternative strategies to either overcome resistance or to prevent the emergence of a resistant leukemic clone.",

However, we were able to isolate a PCR product by RT-PCR with the BCR exon 13 (b2) and ABL1 exon a3 primers. Analysis of the sequence of the RT-PCR product revealed that the fusion point was between BCR exon 14 (b3) and ABL1 exon a3, and that the transcript lacked ABL1 exon a2. The patient achieved cytogenetic remission through combination chemotherapies, but relapse occurred before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and the patient died 11 months after the initialization of chemotherapies. If the BCR/ABL1 fusion transcript is undetected with the ABL1 exon a2 region primer in Ph(+) ALL cases, an RT-PCR analysis that can detect the b3a3 type BCR/ABL1 fusion transcript should be considered to improve diagnosis.

No in vivo studies show whether the altered adhesion properties affect BCR/ABL leukemogenesis.

Lack of P-selectin and ICAM1 did not have a significant effect on the development of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BALL) induced by BCR/ABL. Using mice deficient for P-selectin or ICAM1 alone, we show that P-selectin plays a major role in the acceleration of CML-like leukemia. Lack of P-selectin resulted in early release of BCR/ABL-expressing myeloid progenitors from bone marrow, appearing to alter the biologic properties of leukemic cells rather than their growth rate by increasing their homing to the lungs, causing fatal lung hemorrhages. These results indicate that adhesion of BCR/ABL-expressing myeloid progenitors to marrow stroma through P-selectin and ICAM1 play an inhibitory role in the development of CML-like disease, suggesting that improvement of adhesion between BCR/ABL-expressing myeloid progenitor cells and bone marrow stroma may be of therapeutic value for human CML.",

There is a constant search out of new potential therapeutic molecule to combat this disorder. In most cases, patients with FA develop haematological malignancies with acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Identifying drugs which can efficiently block the pathways of both these disorders can be an ideal and novel strategy to treat FA. The curcumin, a natural compound obtained from turmeric is an interesting therapeutic molecule as it has been reported in the literature to combat both FA as well as leukemia. However, its complete mechanism is not elucidated. Herein, a systems biology approach for elucidating the therapeutic potential of curcumin against FA and leukemia is investigated by analyzing the computational molecular interactions of curcumin ligand with FANC G of FA and seven other key disease targets of leukemia. The proteins namely DOT1L, farnesyl transferase (FDPS), histone decetylase (EP3000), Polo-like kinase (PLK-2), aurora-like kinase (AUKRB), tyrosine kinase (ABL1), and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) were chosen as disease targets for leukemia and modeled structure of FANC G protein as the disease target for FA. The docking investigations showed that curcumin had a very high binding affinity of -8.1 kcal/mol with FANC G protein. The key disease targets of leukemia namely tyrosine kinase (ABL1), aurora-like kinase (AUKRB), and polo-like kinase (PLK-2) showed that they had the comparable binding affinities of -9.7 k cal/mol, -8.7 k cal/mol, and -8.6 k cal/mol, respectively with curcumin. Further, the percentage similarity scores obtained from PAM50 using EMBOSS MATCHER was shown to provide a clue to understand the structural relationships to an extent and to predict the binding affinity. This investigation shows that curcumin effectively interacts with the disease targets of both FA and leukemia.",

In total, 41 spots were differentially expressed and 13 proteins were identified with further MS analysis. Two essential proteins, Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1 (c-ABL) and Heat shock 70kDa protein 4 (Apg-2), were confirmed by Western blot and showed consistent changes with proteomic results. Moreover, functional analysis demonstrated that inhibition of Apg-2 not only decreased cell proliferation, but also induced cell apoptosis in BCR/ABL positive cells (BaF3-BCR/ABL, BaF3-BCR/ABL(T315I)). We also proved that Apg-2 inhibition aggravated H2O2 induced damage in BCR/ABL positive cells, and enhanced the sensitivity of BaF3-BCR/ABL(T315I) to STI571. Taken together, the findings in this work provide us with some clues to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying BCR/ABL in the DNA damage/repair processes and demonstrated that Apg-2 would be a valid target for anti-leukemia drug development.

The mechanism of this phenomenon is unclear: the question of whether tyrosine kinase inhibitors are inactive inside leukemia stem cells or whether leukemia stem cells do not require breakpoint cluster region (Bcr)-Abl signaling is currently under debate. Herein, I propose an alternative model: perhaps the leukemia stem cell requires Bcr-Abl, but is dependent on its kinase-independent functions. Kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor and Janus kinase 2 possess kinase-independent roles in regulation of gene expression; it is worth investigating whether Bcr-Abl has similar functions. Mechanistically, Bcr-Abl is able to activate the Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and/or the Src-kinase Hck/Stat5 pathways in a scaffolding-dependent manner. Whereas the scaffolding activity of Bcr-Abl with Grb2 is dependent on autophosphorylation, kinases such as Hck can use Bcr-Abl as substrate, inducing phosphorylation of Y177 to enable scaffolding ability in the absence of Bcr-Abl catalytic activity. It is worth investigating whether leukemia stem cells exclusively express kinases that are able to use Bcr-Abl as substrate. A kinase-independent role for Bcr-Abl in leukemia stem cells would imply that drugs that target Bcr-Abl's scaffolding ability or its DNA-binding ability should be used in conjunction with current therapeutic regimens to increase their efficacy and eradicate the stem cells of chronic myeloid leukemia.

Depending on the localization of the breakpoint in the bcr gene different chimeric bcr-abl genes are generated, each encoding their own tumor-specific protein: e1-a2P190bcr-abl, b2-a2p210bcr-abl, or b3-a2P210bcr-abl. Especially in ALL, the presence of such a tumor-specific protein is highly associated with a poor prognosis. Detection of these proteins therefore has a strong clinical significance. In this study a polyclonal antiserum, termed BP-2, was raised against a synthetic peptide, corresponding to the tumor-specific 'fusion-point' epitope of the b3-a2P210bcr-abl protein. The specificity of BP-2 for the bcr-abl joining region in b3-a2P210bcr-abl is demonstrated by means of peptide inhibition studies in combination with immunoprecipitation.

Despite the remarkable results achieved with imatinib for the treatment of CML, the emergence of resistance to this drug has become a significant problem. Mutations within the ABL kinase domain have been identified as the main mechanism of resistance to imatinib. Other mechanisms include genomic amplification of BCR-ABL and modulation of drug efflux or influx transporters. Several strategies have been developed to overcome the problem of imatinib resistance, including dose escalation of imatinib, combination treatments, or novel targeted agents. Nilotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor 30-fold more potent than imatinib, active against a wide range of mutant clones, except T315I. Phase I-II trials of nilotinib showed high activity in imatinib-resistant CML and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

The stem and progenitor cell potential of these cultures at different times of incubation in relation to BCR/Abl(protein) expression and sensitivity to imatinib-mesylate was explored by transferring cells to growth-permissive secondary cultures in normoxia, according to the Culture-Repopulating Ability assay methodology.;Hypoxia-resistant cells maintained BCR/Abl(protein) expression until glucose was no longer available in primary hypoxic cultures, where glucose availability appeared to regulate cell number and the balance between the enrichment of cells with kinetic properties typical of stem or progenitor cells. Cells surviving merely hypoxic conditions were, upon transfer to secondary cultures, immediately available for numerical expansion due to the maintained BCR/Abl(protein) expression, and were consequently sensitive to imatinib-mesylate. Instead, BCR/Abl(protein)-negative cells selected in primary cultures under oxygen/glucose shortage underwent a delayed numerical expansion in secondary cultures, which was completely refractory to imatinib-mesylate. Cells with the latter properties were also found in primary chronic myeloid leukemia explants.;Glucose shortage in hypoxia was shown to represent the condition selecting BCR/Abl(protein)-negative cells refractory to imatinib-mesylate from either chronic myeloid leukemia lines or patients.

Since a clear distinction between de novo BCR-ABL+ AML and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis is challenging in many cases, the existence of de novo BCR-ABL+ AML has been a matter of debate for a long time. However, there is increasing evidence suggesting that BCR-ABL+ AML is in fact a distinct subgroup of AML. In this study, we analyzed all published cases since 1975 as well as cases from our institution in order to present common clinical and molecular features of this rare disease. Our analysis shows that BCR-ABL predominantly occurs in AML-NOS, CBF leukemia, and AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. The most common BCR-ABL transcripts (p190 and p210) are nearly equally distributed. Based on the analysis of published data, we provide a clinical algorithm for the initial differential diagnosis of BCR-ABL+ AML. The prognosis of BCR-ABL+ AML seems to depend on the cytogenetic and/or molecular background rather than on BCR-ABL itself. A therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib is reasonable, but-due to a lack of systematic clinical data-their use cannot be routinely recommended in first-line therapy. Beyond first-line treatment of AML, the use of TKI remains an individual decision, both in combination with intensive chemotherapy and/or as a bridge to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In each single case, potential benefits have to be weighed against potential risks. ",

The expression of mdr-1 apparently correlates with the expression of certain surface antigens like CD34 and CD7, which by themselves are associated with the expression of bcl-2 and poor treatment response. The value of hematopoietic growth factors to overcome drug resistance has not yet been clearly demonstrated in clinical trials, but they seem to reduce early mortality in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia when given after chemotherapy. Substantial progress has been made in the understanding of molecular changes in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Combination of all-trans retinoic acid and chemotherapy is the treatment of choice in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation proved to be superior in certain high-risk groups of patients with acute leukemia, including those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the bcr-abl configuration.

The BCR/ABL protein exhibits a deregulated tyrosine-kinase activity capable of phosphorylating different cellular substrates in vivo and in vitro. CRKL, an adaptor protein consisting of SH2 and SH3 domains in the absence of a catalytic domain, is one potential in vivo substrate of BCR/ABL. Previous experiments have shown that CRKL is phosphorylated on tyrosine in the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line K562 and that CRKL is a substrate for ABL and for BCR/ABL in COS-1 cells. In the current study, we show that in peripheral blood cells a direct correlation exists between the presence of BCR/ABL and the phosphorylation status of CRKL. In Ph- peripheral blood cells, CRKL is present only in the nonphosphorylated form. In contrast, all BCR/ABL+ CML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient samples examined showed clear tyrosine-phosphorylation of CRKL. This result strongly suggests that CRKL is a biologically significant substrate for BCR/ABL and is likely to play a major role in the development of Ph+ leukemia.",

The aberration results from a reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, creating a BCR-ABL fusion gene. There are two major forms of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, involving ABL exon 2, but including different exons of BCR gene. The transcript b2a2 or b3a2 codes for a p210 protein. Other fusion gene leads to the expression of an e1a2 transcript, which codes for a p190 protein. Other less common fusion genes are b3a3 or b2a3 (p203) and e19a2 (p230). The incidence of one or other rearrangement in chronic myeloid leukemia patients varies in different reports. In general, fusion transcripts are determined individually, a process which is labor- intensive in order to detect all major fusion transcripts. The objective of this study was to set up a multiplex RT-PCR assay for detection and to determine the frequency of different fusion genes in 75 Iranian patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.;Peripheral blood samples were analyzed by multiplex RT-PCR from 75 adult Iranian chronic myeloid leukemia patients to detect different types of BCR-ABL transcripts of the t(9;22).;All patients examined were positive for some type of BCR/ABL rearrangement.

The rate of co-expression of the b3a2 and b2a2 was 5%.;In contrast to other reports, we did not see any co-expression of p210/p190.

Donor lymphocyte infusion and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) are generally ineffective in such ALLs, whereas GVL is highly active against bcr/abl(+) CML, which does not have a lesion in the INK4A/ARF locus. The mechanisms for the ineffectiveness of GVL are not fully known, and it is possible that intrinsic resistance of acute lymphoid leukemias to immune effectors associated with allogeneic GVL may contribute to ineffectiveness. This work tested the hypothesis that INK4A/ARF mutations that are associated with transformation of bcr/abl(+) CML to an ALL phenotype, and that are associated with increased resistance to apoptosis render ALL cells insensitive to allogeneic immune responses to minor histocompatibility antigens (mHA). Murine acute pre-B ALLs were induced by transfer of the human p210 bcr/abl gene into bone marrow of INK4A/ARF null mice. These ALL lines were then studied in a murine model of MHC-matched, mHA-mismatched allogeneic BMT. In vivo growth of these ALLs was inhibited in allogeneic transplants characterized by active allogeneic immune responses compared to their behavior in syngeneic transplants. In vitro ALLs with INK4A/ARF, p210 bcr/abl, or p190 bcr/abl mutations remained sensitive to anti-mHA cytolytic T cells. In addition, the ALLs were capable of inducing primary immune responses to mHAs in vivo. Thus, ALLs with INK4A/ARF or bcr/abl mutations are not intrinsically resistant to allogeneic T cell responses, suggesting that active immunotherapies against mHA have the potential to control such acute lymphoblastic leukemias.",

In this study, we identified eleven candidate anti-leukemic drugs that might be combined with imatinib, using three approaches: a kinase inhibitor library screen, a gene expression correlation analysis, and literature analysis. We then used an experimental search algorithm to efficiently explore the large space of possible drug and dose combinations and identified drug combinations that selectively kill a BCR-ABL+ leukemic cell line (K562) over a normal fibroblast cell line (IMR-90). Only six iterations of the algorithm were needed to identify very selective drug combinations. The efficacy of the top forty-nine combinations was further confirmed using Ph+ and Ph- ALL patient cells, including imatinib-resistant cells.

A child with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed mixed donor chimerism and persistent bcr-abl transcripts after a matched sibling SCT. There was no response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, but she has remained hematologically normal for more than 5 years. CCA/Ph- was detected but resolved with hypomethylating therapy.",

In order to raise awareness of the problem of adherence, and before developing pragmatic strategies to enhance medication adherence, a deep understanding of the best approaches for measuring adherence in chronic myeloid leukemia patients and identifying non-adherence is required. A systematic literature review on the prevalence, measurement methods, consequences and risk factors for non-adherence to BCR-ABL inhibitors and adherence-enhancing interventions was performed and critically appraised. Of the 19 included articles, 9 were retrospective. Average adherence varied from 19% to almost 100% of the proportion of prescribed drug taken, but it was measured through various different methods and within different study groups. Suboptimal adherence was associated with a negative impact on both clinical and economic outcomes. There is a lack of supportive evidence demonstrating a difference in adherence across BCR-ABL inhibitors and even contradictory results between the 2(nd) generation inhibitors. Drug-related adverse events and forgetfulness were common reasons for intentional and unintentional non-adherence, respectively, but further research is required to identify additional reasons behind non-adherence or patients at risk of non-adherence. Non-adherence in chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with BCR-ABL inhibitors is common and associated with critical outcomes.

The mechanism by which BCR-ABL blocks apoptosis remains unclear, although recent data are beginning to shed light on the signaling pathway. As with other antiapoptotic signals, BCR-ABL induces cellular resistance to a wide spectrum of cytotoxic antitumor agents. However, apoptosis induced by both cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer or lymphokine-activated killer cells is not blocked by BCR-ABL. A substantial number of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia can now be cured, and the prognosis has improved even for those patients who are not cured. Interferon-alpha has emerged as the treatment of choice for patients who do not undergo an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The availability of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has been increased by the ability to find unrelated donors, although graft-versus-host disease remains a major problem.

However, resistance is often reported in patients with advanced-stage disease. Several novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which have been developed to override imatinib resistance mechanisms such as overexpression of Bcr-Abl and point mutations within the Abl kinase domain, are currently competing. Inhibitors of Abl tyrosine kinase are divided into two main groups, namely, ATP-competitive and ATP non-competitive inhibitors. Moreover, ATP-competitive inhibitors are fall into two subclasses, i.e. the Src/Abl inhibitors, and 2-phenylaminopyrimidin-based compounds. Dasatinib (formerly BMS-354825), AP23464, SKI-606 and PD166326 are classified as Src/Abl inhibitors while AMN107 and NS-187 (INNO-406) belong to the latter subclass of inhibitors. Among these agents, clinical studies on dasatinib and AMN107 had started earlier than the others and favorable results are accumulating. Clinical studies of other compounds including NS-187 (INNO-406) will be performed in rapid succession. Because of its strong affinity, most ATP competitive inhibitors may be effective against imatinib-resistant patients. However, to date, an ATP-competitive inhibitor that can inhibit the phosphorylation of T315I Bcr-Abl has not yet been developed. To address this problem, ATP non-competitive inhibitors such as ON012380, Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 and p38 MAP kinase inhibitor BIRB-796 have been developed.

New and investigational therapeutic options that target these specific molecular defects of leukemic cells include the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (STI571) and farnesyltransferase inhibitors (R115777, SCH66336), which block localization of Ras proteins to the cell membrane. While single-agent therapy with these new agents may produce hematologic and cytogenetic remissions in patients with Bcr-Abl-positive leukemias, molecular remissions are less common, and resistance may develop. Therefore, the development of a multifaceted therapeutic approach to these leukemias is of great interest. Arsenic trioxide (ATO), which has significant activity in patients with relapsed and refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia, is a potential addition to the therapeutic arsenal. While some of the molecular activities of ATO are specific to acute promyelocytic leukemia, arsenicals also have a broad variety of antineoplastic properties that may be useful in combination therapy with agents that target specific molecular defects of Bcr-Abl-positive leukemias.",

Phosphorylation of p210 bcr/abl protein in the leukemic cells were assessed by a combination of immunoprecipitation (IP) with c-abl antibody and Western blotting with p-Tyr (pY99) antibody. The protein levels of p210 bcr/abl, Hsp90 and Hsp70 in the leukemic cells were determined by Western blotting with antibodies to c-abl, Hsp90, and Hsp70 respectively.;After treatment with berbamine at 8 microg/ml for 48 h, the percentages of leukemic cells expressing activated caspase-3 and apoptotic cells were 45.69% and 48.43% respectively.

In 1973, Janet Rowley, unraveled the cytogenetic anatomy of the Philadelphia chromosome, which subsequently led to the identification of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene and its principal pathogenetic role in the development of chronic myeloid leukemia. This work was also of major importance to support the idea that cytogenetic changes were drivers of leukemogenesis. John Goldman originally made seminal contributions to the use of autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation from the late 1970s onwards. Then, in collaboration with Brian Druker, he led efforts to develop ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the late 1990s. He also led the global efforts to develop and harmonize methodology for molecular monitoring, and was an indefatigable organizer of international conferences. These conferences brought together clinicians and scientists, and accelerated the adoption of new therapies. The abundance of praise, tributes and testimonies expressed by many serve to illustrate the indelible impressions these two passionate and affable scholars made on so many people's lives. This tribute provides an outline of the remarkable story of chronic myeloid leukemia, and in writing it, it is clear that the historical triumph of biomedical science over this leukemia cannot be considered without appreciating the work of both Janet Rowley and John Goldman.

First, the results demonstrate that the ectopic expression of the p185 Bcr-Abl fusion protein induced hemoglobin in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) HL-60 cells. Exposure to low-dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C; 10 nmol/L) increased hemoglobin levels in HL-60/Bcr-Abl and in the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis K562 cells, which express the p210 Bcr-Abl protein. As compared with HL-60/neo, HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells were resistant to apoptosis induced by Ara-C, doxorubicin, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), which was associated with reduced processing of caspase-8 and Bid protein and decreased cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c (cyt c). Exposure to CGP57148B alone increased hemoglobin levels and CD11b expression and induced apoptosis of HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells. CGP57148B treatment down-regulated antiapoptotic XIAP, cIAP1, and Bcl-x(L), without affecting Bcl-2, Bax, Apaf-1, Fas (CD95), Fas ligand, Abl, and Bcr-Abl levels. CGP57148B also inhibited constitutively active Akt kinase and NFkappaB in Bcr-Abl-positive cells. Attenuation of NFkappaB activity by ectopic expression of transdominant repressor of IkappaB sensitized HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells to TNF-alpha but not to apoptosis induced by Ara-C or doxorubicin. Importantly, cotreatment with CGP57148B significantly increased Ara-C- or doxorubicin-induced apoptosis of HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells. This was associated with greater cytosolic accumulation of cyt c and PARP cleavage activity of caspase-3.

A third type of BCR/ABL (with e1a2 type of junction) has been identified in approximately 50% of the Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL) cases and results in the production of a BCR/ABL protein of 190 kD (P190). The presence of this transcript has been associated almost exclusively with the presence of an acute leukemia phenotype. By contrast, here we describe that in addition to transcripts with the b2a2 and b3a2 types of junction corresponding to the P210 proteins, virtually all CMLs at diagnosis bear also BCR/ABL transcripts showing the e1a2 type of junction, which correspond to the acute leukemia-associated P190 protein. With a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay we found that the amount of the e1a2 mRNA present in CMLs in chronic phase, although in absolute amount much lower than that present in Ph+ ALLs, represents in most cases approximately 20% to 30% of the total BCR/ABL transcripts.

The aim of the current study was to explore which microRNA are unique for seven different subtypes of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.;Expression levels of 397 microRNA (including novel microRNA) were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in 81 cases of pediatric leukemia and 17 normal hematopoietic control cases.;All major subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, i.e. T-cell, MLL-rearranged, TEL-AML1-positive, E2A-PBX1-positive and hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with the exception of BCR-ABL-positive and 'B-other' acute lymphoblastic leukemias (defined as precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia not carrying the foregoing cytogenetic aberrations), were found to have unique microRNA-signatures that differed from each other and from those of healthy hematopoietic cells. Strikingly, the microRNA signature of TEL-AML1-positive and hyperdiploid cases partly overlapped, which may suggest a common underlying biology. Moreover, aberrant down-regulation of let-7b (~70-fold) in MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia was linked to up-regulation of oncoprotein c-Myc (P(FDR)<0.0001). Resistance to vincristine and daunorubicin was characterized by an approximately 20-fold up-regulation of miR-125b, miR-99a and miR-100 (P(FDR)≤0.002). No discriminative microRNA were found for prednisolone response and only one microRNA was linked to resistance to L-asparaginase. A combined expression profile based on 14 microRNA that were individually associated with prognosis, was highly predictive of clinical outcome in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (5-year disease-free survival of 89.4%±7% versus 60.8±12%, P=0.001).;Genetic subtypes and drug-resistant leukemic cells display characteristic microRNA signatures in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Functional studies of discriminative and prognostically important microRNA may provide new insights into the biology of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",

Our findings indicate that inhibition of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) in Bcr-Abl+ cells overcomes IM resistance although the precise mechanism of Jak2 action is unknown. Knocking down Jak2 in Bcr-Abl+ cells reduced levels of the Bcr-Abl protein and also the phosphorylation of Tyr177 of Bcr-Abl, and Jak2 overexpression rescued these knockdown effects. Treatment of Bcr-Abl+ cells with Jak2 inhibitors for 4-6 h but not with IM also reduced Bcr-Abl protein and pTyr177 levels. In vitro kinase experiments performed with recombinant Jak2 showed that Jak2 readily phosphorylated Tyr177 of Bcr-Abl (a Jak2 consensus site, YvnV) whereas c-Abl did not. Importantly, Jak2 inhibition decreased pTyr177 Bcr-Abl in immune complexes but did not reduce levels of Bcr-Abl, suggesting that the reduction of Bcr-Abl by Jak2 inhibition is a separate event from phosphorylation of Tyr177. Jak2 inhibition by chemical inhibitors (TG101209/WP1193) and Jak2 knockdown diminished the activation of Ras, PI-3 kinase pathways and reduced levels of pTyrSTAT5. These findings suggest that Bcr-Abl stability and oncogenic signaling in CML cells are under the control of Jak2.",

The intervals from diagnosis to BM harvest were median 159 (range 78-463) and from preceding chemotherapy to BM harvest median 39 (range 26-69) days, respectively. A limiting log(10)-dilution RT-PCR was used to semiquantify BCR-ABL-positive cells. All autografts appeared to be significantly contaminated with residual leukemic cells. The BCR-ABL-specific titers ranged from 1:10(3) to 1:10(6) (median 1:10(4)) above the limit of detection. This was the rationale to purge the grafts using two cycles of IgM anti-CD10, CD19, and AB4 MoAbs-coated immunomagnetic beads (IMB). Purging depleted median 3 (range 2-4) logs of residual leukemia, resulting in a median 1:10(1) (range 1:10(0) to 1:10(3)) postpurge BCR-ABL-specific titer. The second purging cycle accounted for 1 log of depletion. The mean +/- s.e.m. post-purge recoveries of MNC and CFU-GM were 59 +/- 4%, and 61 +/- 9%, respectively.

Despite remarkable improvement in the treatment outcomes of these diseases over the past several decades, the prognosis for certain high-risk groups of leukemia and for relapsed disease remains poor. However, recent insights into different types of 'driver' lesions of leukemogenesis, such as the aberrant activation of signaling pathways and various epigenetic modifications, have led to the discovery of novel agents that specifically target the mechanism of transformation. In parallel, emerging approaches in cancer immunotherapy have led to newer therapies that can exploit and harness cytotoxic immunity directed against malignant cells. This review details the rationale and implementation of recent and specifically targeted therapies in acute pediatric leukemia. Topics covered include the inhibition of critical cell signaling pathways [BCR-ABL, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and Janus-associated kinase (JAK)], proteasome inhibition, inhibition of epigenetic regulators of gene expression [DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and disruptor of telomeric signaling-1 (DOT1L) inhibitors], monoclonal antibodies and immunoconjugated toxins, bispecific T-cell engaging (BiTE) antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor-modified (CAR) T cells.

We examined cells from mice that developed leukemia while under treatment for Bcr/Abl kinase domain point mutations but these were not detected. In addition, culture of such cells ex vivo showed that they were as sensitive as the parental cell line to nilotinib but that the presence of stromal support allowed resistant cells to grow out. Nilotinib also exhibited impressive anti-leukemia activity in P190 Bcr/Abl transgenic mice that had developed overt leukemia/lymphoma masses and that otherwise would have been expected to die within 7 days. Visible lymphoma masses disappeared within six days of treatment and leukemic cell numbers in peripheral blood were significantly reduced. Treated mice survived more than 30 days.;These results show that nilotinib has very impressive anti-leukemia activity but that lymphoblastic leukemia cells can become unresponsive to it both in vitro and in vivo through mechanisms that appear to be Bcr/Abl independent.",

Quantitative assessment of BCR/ABL transcript level by RT-PCR showed 60 and 70% BCR/ABL positivity in two peripheral blood samples at 6,5 and 10,5 months after diagnosis, respectively, which does not correspond to the expression from two identical BCR/ABL hybrid genes. Therefore, the possible mechanism of the origin of two BCR/ABL fusion signals present on both chromosomes 9 could not be resolved and remains speculative. The second case was a 53 years old male with diagnosis of chronic phase of CML, with first sign of acceleration one month after diagnosis and death because of sepsis in blastic phase within four months. The cytogenetic findings were identical to those in case No. 1., i.e. karyotype 46, XY by G-banding, two BCR/ABL fusion signals on both chromosomes 9 and RT-PCR molecular studies proved b3a2 breakpoints. It is generally accepted that prognosis of the patients with fused BCR/ABL gene located on chromosome 9 is poor. The presence of two fused genes could be anticipated as two Ph chromosomes in accelerated and blastic phases of the disease. However, in our study, quantitative findings of BCR/ABL transcripts did not corresponded to the expression of two BCR/ABL genes originating from duplication. If this assumption is correct then the expression of both fused genes BCR/ABL was in case No. 1 equally suppressed and total expression reached about the level of one BCR/ABL gene.",

To examine whether the leukemia is still Bcr-Abl-dependent in patients who have responded to imatinib mesylate but have relapsed, a quantitative assay that directly measures enzymatic activity of Bcr-Abl toward one of its major signaling substrates has been developed. This assay allows monitoring both of the imatinib mesylate sensitivity of patient cells in vitro, and of the endogenous inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase activity during imatinib mesylate treatment and relapse. Studies show that imatinib mesylate resistance is associated with restored activation of the Bcr-Abl signal transduction pathway in the majority of cases, indicating that Bcr-Abl remains a valid target for therapeutic intervention.

CML, a myeloproliferative disorder, progresses through three phases--chronic phase, accelerated phase and blast crisis. Current therapies include drug regimens such as interferon alpha, hydroxyurea, busulfan or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the only curative treatment for CML, which is, however, limited to younger patients with a suitable donor. INHIBITION OF BCR-ABL AS EFFECTIVE AND SELECTIVE TREATMENT IN CML: In vitro studies and studies in animal models have shown, that Bcr-Abl is the molecular cause CML. Therefore inhibition of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase is expected to be an effective and selective treatment modality for CML. STI571 was shown to be a competitive inhibitor at the ATP-binding site of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and c-kit tyrosine kinases. It shows effects on proliferation and survival of Bcr-Abl-expressing cells without affecting normal cells or Ph-negative leukemic cells. DRUG RESISTANCE TO STI571: Several mechanisms of resistance have been identified from in vitro studies with Bcr-Abl-positive cell lines. Mechanisms include amplification or overexpression of Bcr-Abl or an increased expression of P-gly-coprotein. In a mouse model the binding of STI571 to acidic alpha 1 glycoprotein (AAG) has been proposed to be involved in the development of STI571 resistance. Recent studies with clinical samples from resistant patients have shown that point mutations in the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl play a role in the development of resistance to STI571.;STI571 is a promising example of a moleculary targeted therapy directed towards the molecular cause of CML. To maximize the therapeutic value and to avoid the induction of resistance, a combination of the drug with other chemotherapies should be considered. According to its pharmacological profile, STI571 could also be useful in the treatment of tumors with deregulated PDGF receptor or c-kit signaling, e.g., in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with a t(5;12) chromosomal translocation or in cases with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).

However, its role in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a malignant counterpart of normal progenitor B cells, is not fully understood. Here we show that SOX4 is highly expressed in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. To systematically study the function of Sox4 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we established a genetically defined mouse leukemia model by transforming progenitor B cells carrying a floxed Sox4 allele and inducing deletion of the allele by the self-excising Cre recombinase. This model allowed us to work with two groups of leukemic cells that had either one copy or both copies of Sox4 deleted. We found that depletion of Sox4 in transformed cells in vitro reduced cell growth in vitro and the progression of leukemia in vivo. Moreover, depletion of Sox4 in leukemic cells in vivo prolonged the survival of the mice, suggesting that it could be a potential target in acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy. Our microarray and bioChIP studies revealed that Tcf7l1 was the key gene directly regulated by Sox4. Knockdown of Tcf7l1 reduced cell proliferation, just as did knockout of Sox4, and ectopic expression of Tcf7l1 could reverse the effect of Sox4 knockout on cell proliferation.

Often, relapse occurs in peripheral organs, such as the CNS, which acts as a sanctuary site for leukemia cells to escape anti-cancer treatments. Similar to normal leukocyte migration, leukemia dissemination entails migration of cells from the blood circulation into tissues by extravasation. To extravasate, leukemia cells cross through vascular endothelial walls via a process called transendothelial migration, which requires cytoskeletal remodeling. However, the specific molecular players in leukemia extravasation are not fully known. We examined the role of myosin-IIA a cytoskeletal class II myosin motor protein, in leukemia progression and dissemination into the CNS by use of a mouse model of Bcr-Abl-driven B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Small hairpin RNA-mediated depletion of myosin-IIA did not affect apoptosis or the growth rate of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. However, in an in vivo leukemia transfer model, myosin-IIA depletion slowed leukemia progression and prolonged survival, in part, by reducing the ability of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to engraft efficiently. Finally, myosin-IIA inhibition, either by small hairpin RNA depletion or chemical inhibition by blebbistatin, drastically reduced CNS infiltration of leukemia cells. The effects on leukemia cell entry into tissues were mostly a result of the requirement for myosin-IIA to enable leukemia cells to complete the transendothelial migration process during extravasation. Overall, our data implicate myosin-IIA as a key mediator of leukemia cell migration, making it a promising target to inhibit leukemia dissemination in vivo and potentially reduce leukemia relapses.

The exquisite sensitivity of the PCR facilitates the detection of residual leukemic cells after chemotherapy or after bone marrow transplantation. However, the detection of minimal residual disease does not yield any information on the malignant potential of the bcr/abl-rearranged cells. Qualitative PCR is therefore of limited prognostic value in the monitoring of residual leukemia. We have adapted the PCR for quantitative evaluation of cells carrying the bcr/abl rearrangement and by means of two exemplary cases of CML patients after bone marrow transplantation and under treatment with alpha-interferon, respectively, we show that this new technique is suitable for the long term follow-up of the activity of the residual bcr/abl rearranged clone. Longitudinal monitoring of residual disease by the technique presented provides a novel tool for detection of incipient relapse at a very early stage.",

The SH2 domain was not required for induction of B-lymphoid leukemia in mice by BCR/ABL. Under conditions where the p190 and p210 forms of BCR/ABL induce fatal CML-like myeloproliferative disease within 4 weeks, p210 SH2 mutants induced CML-like disease in some mice only after a significant delay, with other recipients succumbing to B-lymphoid leukemia instead. In contrast, p190 BCR/ABL SH2 point and deletion mutants rapidly induced CML-like disease. These results provide the first direct evidence of significant differences in cell signaling by the Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase between these distinct leukemias. Contrary to previous observations, high levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity in primary malignant lymphoblasts and myeloid cells from recipients of marrow transduced with the BCR/ABL SH2 mutants were found. Hence, the decreased induction of CML-like disease by the p210 BCR/ABL SH2 mutants is not due to impaired activation of PI 3-kinase.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cellular or proto-oncogenes are normal cellular genes important in normal cell growth and development. In some instances abnormal expression of these genes is associated with altered cell growth or with malignant transformation. Abnormalities of cellular oncogenes are common in human leukemias. These arise by multiple mechanisms such as mutation, translocation, amplification, and others. Sometimes more than one abnormality is present within a single oncogene. In other instances, a leukemia cell may contain abnormalities of several different oncogenes. Some oncogene abnormalities are relatively specific for certain leukemias and occur in almost all cases; examples include ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia or MYC in Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma. Other abnormalities are also relatively specific but occur in only some cases such as NRAS in acute myelogenous leukemia or BCL2 in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In other leukemias, such as most cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, oncogene abnormalities are uncommon. The precise role of oncogenes in the pathogenesis of human leukemia is unknown. Retrovirus transduced versions of some of the oncogenes modified in human leukemias cause leukemia in animals. Other oncogenes, modified or unmodified, transform animal and human hematopoietic cells in vitro. Some oncogene products are hematopoietic growth factors or growth factor receptors while others regulate cell proliferation or differentiation by diverse mechanisms. Disruption of the balance between these processes seems the most likely mechanism of oncogene related leukemogenesis. If the role of oncogenes in human leukemias can be defined, innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies may be forthcoming.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Although the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is highly effective for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), relapse with emerging imatinib-resistance mutations in the BCR/ABL kinase domain poses a significant problem. Here, we demonstrate that rottlerin, a putative protein kinase C-delta (PKCdelta)-specific inhibitor, acts synergistically with imatinib to induce apoptosis of BCR/ABL-expressing K562 and Ton.B210 cells. However, rottlerin inhibited neither PKCdelta nor BCR/ABL in these cells. On the other hand, rottlerin, previously characterized also as a mitochondrial uncoupler, transiently but significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and gradually induced mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Moreover, two other mitochondrial uncouplers, FCCP and DNP, very similarly induced apoptosis of BCR/ABL-expressing cells in a synergistic manner with imatinib. Imatinib synergistically enhanced mitochondrial membrane permeabilization induced by mitochondrial uncouplers, which led to release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm and activation of caspases-3 and -9. Rottlerin also enhanced the cytotoxic effect of imatinib in leukemic cells from patients with CML blast crisis and Ph-positive ALL or a cell line expressing the imatinib-resistant E255K BCR/ABL mutant. The present study indicates that rottlerin synergistically enhances imatinib-induced apoptosis through its mitochondrial uncoupling effect independent of PKCdelta and may contribute to the development of new treatment strategy to overcome the imatinib resistance and to cure the BCR/ABL expressing leukemias.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH) is increasingly used for the identification of BCR/ABL gene rearrangements in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In the present study, we have explored the incidence of both typical and atypical iFISH patterns of BCR/ABL gene rearrangements in a series of 168 consecutive BCR/ABL+ patients--135 CML, 31 precursor B-ALL and two acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) cases--and established their underlying genetic alterations through further molecular and chromosome analyses. Two different FISH probes (Vysis Inc., Downers Grove, IL, USA) were used: the LSI BCR/ABL dual color extra signal (ES) and the dual color dual fusion BCR/ABL probe (D-FISH). Our results show that most BCR/ABL+ patients (83%, including 88% of all CML, 61% of ALL and one of two AML) displayed typical iFISH patterns of either Major (M) BCR/ABL (87% of CML, 13% of ALL and one of the two AML) or minor (m) BCR/ABL gene rearrangements (1% of all CML and 48% of ALL cases) with the two probes. Further molecular and cytogenetic studies confirmed the presence of such typical rearrangements in all except one of these ALL cases who had coexistence of an MBCR/ABL and an mBCR/ABL gene rearrangement together with monosomy 9. In the remaining 29 cases (17%), up to five different atypical iFISH patterns were detected with the ES probe. Atypical iFISH patterns were most frequently due to additional numerical changes--most often supernumerary Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome (7%) but also gain or loss of chromosome 9 (1%) or 22 (1%). Deletion of 9q sequences proximal to the breakpoint were also frequently observed with the ES probe (8%). Application of the D-FISH probe showed that in most of these latter cases (5%) deletion of 22q sequences distal to the breakpoint also occurred. The remaining cases with atypical iFISH had cryptic insertion of BCR in 9q34 (1%). Exact interpretation of each iFISH pattern was supported by FISH on metaphases and molecular determination of the BCR breakpoint. In summary, our results indicate that despite the high incidence of typical iFISH patterns of BCR/ABL gene rearrangements, atypical patterns are also found in BCR/ABL+ acute leukemias; the precise definition of the alteration present in individual cases is dependent on metaphase studies and molecular definition of the breakpoint.",

Imatinib inhibited BCR-ABL activity to the same degree in all stem (CD34+CD38-, CD133+) and progenitor (CD34+CD38+) cells and in quiescent and cycling progenitors from newly diagnosed CML patients. Although short-term in vitro imatinib treatment reduced the expansion of CML stem/progenitors, cytokine support permitted growth and survival in the absence of BCR-ABL activity that was comparable to that of normal stem/progenitor counterparts.

In contrast to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), patients with Ph-positive ALL usually demonstrate expression of a truncated version of the BCR-ABL protein called p190bcr-abl. Irrespective of age and breakpoint location, Ph-positive ALL carries a poor prognosis. Although remission rates are identical to those of Ph-negative ALL, relapse is almost universal and long-term survival remains rare. Given the poor outcome with current chemotherapy consolidation programs, stem cell transplantation is usually recommended for these patients in first remission or as soon as feasible. Even with transplantation the impact on outcome is limited and new therapeutic concepts are urgently needed. One of the most promising developments in recent years has been the introduction of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as STI571. An overview of current treatment modalities in Ph-positive ALL will be provided and the rationale for new therapies will be discussed.",

The constitutively active tyrosine kinase is currently accepted to be the cause of chronic myeloid leukemia. The introduction of imatinib has considerably changed the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Prior studies demonstrated high rates of cytogenetic responses in all phases of the disease.;The authors evaluated the cytogenetic and molecular responses of 21 chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients who were consecutively admitted to their center. 13 of them were primarily treated with imatinib, and the other 7 were heavily pretreated with interferon alpha, cytarabine, all-trans-retinoic acid.

Although ABL kinase inhibitors have shown great promise in the treatment of CML, the persistence of residual disease and the occurrence of resistance have prompted investigations into the molecular effectors of BCR-ABL. Here, we show that BCR-ABL stimulates the proteasome-dependent degradation of members of the forkhead family of tumor suppressors in vitro, in an in vivo animal model, and in samples from patients with BCR-ABL-positive CML or ALL. As several downstream mediators of BCR-ABL are regulated by the proteasome degradation pathway, we also show that inhibition of this pathway, using bortezomib, causes regression of CML-like disease. Bortezomib treatment led to inhibition of BCR-ABL-induced suppression of FoxO proteins and their proapoptotic targets, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and BIM, thereby providing novel insights into the molecular effects of proteasome inhibitor therapy. We additionally show sensitivity of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL T315I cells to bortezomib. Our data delineate the involvement of FoxO proteins in BCR-ABL-induced evasion of apoptosis and provide evidence that bortezomib is a candidate therapeutic in the treatment of BCR-ABL-induced leukemia.",

The Bcr sequences activate the Abl tyrosine kinase which is required for the transforming function of Bcr-Abl. The Bcr sequences also enhance an F-actin-binding activity associated with c-Abl. Here, we show that binding of c-Abl and Bcr-Abl proteins to actin filaments in vivo and in vitro is mediated by an evolutionarily conserved domain at the C-terminal end of c-Abl. The c-Abl F-actin-binding domain contains a consensus motif found in several other actin-crosslinking proteins. Mutations in the consensus motif are shown to abolish binding to F-actin. Bcr-Abl proteins unable to associate with F-actin have a reduced ability to transform Rat-1 fibroblasts and to abrogate the requirement for interleukin-3 in the lymphoblastoid cell line Ba/F3. In transformed cells, Bcr-Abl induces a redistribution of F-actin into punctate, juxtanuclear aggregates.

Minimal residual disease (MRD) is now considered an important indicator response of disease response to treatment.

Protein kinase CK2 is known to phosphorylate PTEN thereby driving PTEN protein stabilization and concomitant PTEN functional inactivation. In agreement, we found that adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples show significantly higher CK2 kinase activity and lower PTEN lipid phosphatase activity than healthy controls. Moreover, the clinical-grade CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 (Silmitasertib) reversed PTEN levels in leukemia cells to those observed in healthy controls, and promoted leukemia cell death without significantly affecting normal bone marrow cells. Our studies indicate that CK2-mediated PTEN posttranslational inactivation, associated with PI3K/Akt pathway hyperactivation, are a common event in adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and suggest that CK2 inhibition may constitute a valid, novel therapeutic tool in this malignancy.

The molecular abnormality in the former group is similar to that found in chronic myelogenous leukemia. To characterize the abnormality in the breakpoint cluster region-unrearranged form, we have mapped a 9;22 translocation from the Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line SUP-B13 by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and have cloned the DNA at the translocation junctions. We demonstrate a BCR-ABL fusion gene on the Philadelphia chromosome. The breakpoint on chromosome 9 is within ABL between exons Ia and II, and the breakpoint on chromosome 22 is approximately equal to 50 kilobases upstream of a breakpoint cluster region in an intron of the BCR gene. This upstream BCR breakpoint leads to inclusion of fewer BCR sequences in the fusion gene, compared with the BCR-ABL fusion gene of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Consequently, the associated mRNA and protein are smaller. The exons from ABL are the same. Analysis of leukemic cells from four other patients with breakpoint cluster region-unrearranged Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia revealed a rearrangement on chromosome 22 close to the breakpoint in SUP-B13 in only one patient. These data indicate that breakpoints do not cluster tightly in this region but are scattered, possibly in a large intron. Given the large size of BCR and the heterogeneity in breakpoint location, detection of BCR rearrangement by standard Southern blot analysis is difficult. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis should allow detection at the DNA level in every patient and thus will permit clinical correlation of the breakpoint location with prognosis.",

Although imatinib is the standard treatment for Ph+ leukemia, response rate of Ph+ ALL to imatinib is low, relapse is frequent and quick. Studies have documented the potential anti-tumor activities of curcumin. However, whether curcumin can be used in the therapy for Ph+ ALL remains obscure. Here, we reported that curcumin induced apoptosis by inhibition of AKT/mTOR and ABL/STAT5 signaling, down-regulation of BCR/ABL expression, and induction of the BCL2/BAX imbalance. Curcumin exerted synergetic anti-leukemia effects with imatinib by inhibition of the imatinib-mediated overactivation of AKT/mTOR signaling and down-regulation of BCR/ABL gene expression. In primary samples from Ph+ ALL patients, curcumin inhibited cellular proliferation and down-regulated constitutive activation of growth-signaling pathways not only in newly diagnosed patients but also in imatinib-resistant patients.

The hallmark of CML is the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome which is a shortened chromosome 22 (22q-) resulting from a reciprocal translocation involving chromosome 9 and chromosome 22, designed t (9;22) (q34;q11). This translocation juxtaposes parts of two genes; ABL on chromosome 9 and BCR (breakpoint cluster region) on chromosome 22. Transcription of the BCR/ABL fusion gene results in an hybrid mRNA that is translated into a 210 kDa or 190 kDa protein, depending on the location of the breakpoint in the bcr region. This protein plays a key role in CML: its tyrosine-kinase activity, that differs from the normal ABL product, may be involved in leukemic cell growth. Nonetheless, the loss of the negative cell growth regulation by c-ABL, or BCR/ABL fusion protein interaction with other cellular genes (such as RAS or c-MYC) could also be involved in CML pathophysiology. A better understanding of the molecular mecanisms of CML could lead to specific treatment, such as tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides, or site-specific DNA-binding proteins designed against BCR/ABL oncogenic fusion sequence.",

Moreover, nutlin-3 drastically enhanced imatinib-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner in various BCR/ABL-expressing cells, which included primary leukemic cells from patients with CML blast crisis or Ph+ ALL and cells expressing the imatinib-resistant E255K BCR/ABL mutant. Nutlin-3 and imatinib synergistically induced Bax activation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and caspase-3 cleavage leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis, which was inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-XL. Imatinib did not significantly affect the nutlin-3-induced expression of p53 but abrogated that of p21. Furthermore, activation of Bax as well as caspase-3 induced by combined treatment with imatinib and nutlin-3 was observed preferentially in cells expressing p21 at reduced levels.

        "Doc_abstract":"Chronic myeloid leukemia is a neoplasia resulting from a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 producing the BCR-ABL hybrid known as the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). In chronic myeloid leukemia a proliferation of malignant myeloid cells occurs in the bone marrow due to excessive tyrosine kinase activity. In order to maintain homeostasis, natural killer cells, by means of receptors, identify the major histocompatibility complex on the surface of tumor cells and subsequently induce apoptosis. The NKG2D receptor in the natural killer cells recognizes the transmembrane proteins related to major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related genes A and B (MICA and MICB), and it is by the interaction between NKG2D and MICA that natural killer cells exert cytotoxic activity against chronic myeloid leukemia tumor cells. However, in the case of chronic exposure of the NKG2D receptor, the MICA ligand releases soluble proteins called sMICA from the tumor cell surface, which negatively modulate NKG2D and enable the tumor cells to avoid lysis mediated by the natural killer cells. Blocking the formation of sMICA may be an important antitumor strategy.

In vivo antitumor efficacy of OP449 was measured in human HL-60 xenografted murine model.;We observed that OP449 inhibited growth of CML cells including those from patients with blastic phase disease and patients harboring highly drug-resistant BCR-ABL1 mutations. Combined treatment with OP449 and ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors was significantly more cytotoxic to K562 cells and primary CD34(+) CML cells. SET protein levels remained unchanged with OP449 treatment, but BCR-ABL1-mediated downstream signaling was significantly inhibited with the degradation of key signaling molecules such as BCR-ABL1, STAT5, and AKT. Similarly, AML cell lines and primary patient samples with various genetic lesions showed inhibition of cell growth after treatment with OP449 alone or in combination with respective kinase inhibitors.

As compared with their sensitive counterparts, Gleevec-resistant cell types were >/=5-fold resistant to Gleevec-induced apoptosis. Bcr-Abl protein levels were significantly increased in HL-60/Bcr-Abl R and K562 R (+Bcr-Abl) cells, but K562 R (-Bcr-Abl) cells showed a marked decline in the mRNA and protein levels and activity of Bcr-Abl. Bcr-Abl TK level and activity corresponded to the signal transducers and activators of transcription-5 DNA binding activity and up-regulation of heat shock protein 70 levels. The decline in Bcr-Abl expression and TK activity in K562 R (-Bcr-Abl) cells was associated with reduced AKT kinase and signal transducers and activators of transcription-5 DNA binding activities and increased sensitivity to the death ligand Apo-2 ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine-induced apoptosis. All Gleevec-resistant cell types were sensitive to 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG)- and PD180970 (a SRC and Bcr-Abl TK inhibitor)-induced apoptosis. Treatment with 17-AAG or PD180970 also induced apoptosis of CD34+ leukemic cells from three patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis who had progressive leukemia while receiving Gleevec therapy. Taken together, these findings indicate that in addition to overexpression or mutations in Bcr-Abl, resistance to Gleevec may also develop due to a loss of Bcr-Abl expression.

Chronic myeloid leukemia is a disease of the hematopoietic stem cell that progress in a multistep fashion. The biphasic or triphasic clinical course of the disease exemplies the multistep process of tumor progression from the indolent chronic phase to a more aggressive and terminal blast crisis. CML was the first neoplastic disease shown to be associated with consistent karyotypic abnormality now known as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The result of the Philadelphia chromosome translocation t(9;22)(q34:q11) is the transposition of the c-abl oncogene from chromosome 9 to chromosome 22, where it is fused with part of the her gene. The translocation generates a new hybrid bcr-abl gene which plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of CML. Presently, CML is perhaps the best understood cancer in humans and the model of oncogenesis mediated by the Ph chromosome translocation is one of the best-characterized example of gene activation in leukemia.",

However, almost all CML colonies that grow in the presence of 1.0 micromol/L CGP57148B are BCR-ABL-positive, which may reflect the fact that residual normal clonogenic myeloid precursors are infrequent in most patients with CML.

RUNX1-ETO is thought to promote leukemia development through the aberrant regulation of RUNX1 (AML1) target genes. Repression of these genes occurs via the recruitment of the corepressors N-COR and SMRT due to their interaction with ETO. Mechanisms of RUNX1-ETO target gene upregulation remain less well understood. Here we show that RUNX1-ETO9a, the leukemogenic alternatively spliced transcript expressed from t(8;21), upregulates target gene Alox5, which is a gene critically required for the promotion of chronic myeloid leukemia development by BCR-ABL. Loss of Alox5 expression reduces activity of RUNX1-ETO9a, MLL-AF9 and PML-RARα in vitro. However, Alox5 is not essential for the induction of leukemia by RUNX1-ETO9a in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that the upregulation of Alox5 by RUNX1-ETO9a occurs via the C₂H₂ zinc finger transcription factor KLF6, a protein required for early hematopoiesis and yolk sac development. Furthermore, KLF6 is specifically upregulated by RUNX1-ETO in human leukemia cells. This identifies KLF6 as a novel mediator of t(8;21) target gene regulation, providing a new mechanism for RUNX1-ETO transcriptional control.",

The agent is now also approved for newly diagnosed chronic phase (CP) patients. This article reviews the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of dasatinib as well as clinical data limited to CP-CML patients. Four-year follow-up of a phase III dose-optimization trial confirmed that better progression-free survival (66%) and overall survival (82%) were obtained with a dose of 100 mg once daily (od) than with the standard 70 mg twice daily dosing (65% and 75%, respectively). The 100 mg od dosing schedule was also associated with the highest benefit-risk ratio for CP patients with resistant, intolerant, or suboptimal response. Recent results of a phase III trial in newly diagnosed patients demonstrated that dasatinib 100 mg od has superiority in terms of confirmed cytogenetic and molecular responses, with faster responses and high activity in high Sokal risk patients compared with standard-dose imatinib.",

While novel therapies such as treatment with interferon-alpha or bone marrow transplantation have successively improved the outcome of CML treatment, hope for future progress in the therapy of CML lies in an almost unique feature of this hematological malignancy. In contrast to many other forms or subforms of leukemias which display a great diversity in chromosomal alterations, most cases (>95%) of CML seem to be caused by an almost invariably found cytogenetic aberration, the so-called Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), resulting in the bcr-abl fusion gene. Its gene product, p210bcr-abl (Bcr-Abl), is believed to be essential for hematopoietic cell transformation and seems to exert its effects by interfering with cellular signal transduction pathways, normally involved in the control of cell death and proliferation. Several partially interacting pathways have been shown to be induced by Bcr-Abl. The role of most of them is still unclear and, as understanding their biological functions should lead to novel therapeutic strategies on a molecular basis, much effort is spent on identifying their precise roles in CML.

Here, we report that the novel triterpenoid methyl-2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-diene-28-oate (CDDO-Me) potently induced cytotoxicity in imatinib-resistant KBM5 cells expressing the T315I mutation of bcr-abl (24-h EC50, 540 nmol/L). In long-term culture, CDDO-Me abrogated the growth of human parental KBM5 and KBM5-STI cells with 96-h IC50 of 205 and 221 nmol/L, respectively. In addition, CDDO-Me rapidly decreased the viability of murine lymphoid Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type p210 as well as the imatinib-resistant E255K and T315I mutations of bcr-abl. The low-dose effects of CDDO-Me are associated with inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption, whereas the cytotoxic effects appear to be mediated by a rapid and selective depletion of mitochondrial glutathione that accompanies the increased generation of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysfunction. Interestingly, the mitochondriotoxic effects of CDDO-Me are followed by the rapid autophagocytosis of intracellular organelles or the externalization of phosphatidylserine in different cell types. We conclude that alterations in mitochondrial function by CDDO-Me can result in autophagy or apoptosis of chronic myeloid leukemia cells regardless of the mutational status of bcr-abl. CDDO-Me is in clinical trials and shows signs of clinical activity, with minimal side effects and complete lack of cardiotoxicity. Studies in leukemias are in preparation.",

The recognition that some patients experience relapse due to resistance-conferring point mutations within BCR-ABL sparked the development of the second-generation ABL kinase inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib. Collectively, these drugs target most resistant BCR-ABL mutants, with the exception of BCR-ABL(T315I). A third wave of advances is now cresting in the form of ABL kinase inhibitors whose target profile encompasses BCR-ABL(T315I). The leading third-generation clinical candidate for treatment-refractory CML, including patients with the T315I mutation, is ponatinib (AP24534), a pan-BCR-ABL inhibitor that has entered pivotal phase 2 testing. A second inhibitor with activity against the BCR-ABL(T315I) mutant, DCC-2036, is in phase 1 clinical evaluation. We provide an up-to-date synopsis of BCR-ABL signaling pathways, highlight new findings on mechanisms underlying BCR-ABL mutation acquisition and disease progression, discuss the use of nilotinib and dasatinib in a first-line capacity, and evaluate ponatinib, DCC-2036, and other ABL kinase inhibitors with activity against BCR-ABL(T315I) in the development pipeline.",

However, the interaction between LICs and normal hematopoietic cells at the early phase has not been clearly delineated because of the lack of a suitable experimental model. In this study, we succeeded in causing a marked leukocytosis resembling CML from restricted foci of LICs in the normal hematopoietic system by direct transplantation of BCR-ABL gene-transduced LICs into the bone marrow (BM) cavity of nonirradiated mice. Herein, we observed that BCR-ABL(+)lineage(-)c-kit(-) immature leukemia cells produced high levels of an inflammatory chemokine, MIP-1α/CCL3, which promoted the development of CML. Conversely, ablation of the CCL3 gene in LICs dramatically inhibited the development of CML and concomitantly reduced recurrence after the cessation of a short-term tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Finally, normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells can directly impede the maintenance of LICs in BM in the absence of CCL3 signal. ",

Stem cell transplantation, an accepted curative option for which extensive experience has been gained, is limited by high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in older patients. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting BCR-ABL are widely used and induce remission in a high proportion of patients, but resistance and incomplete response to these agents portends eventual relapse and disease progression. Although BCR-ABL inhibitors eradicate most CML cells, they are largely ineffective against the reservoir of quiescent leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Thus a strong medical need exists for therapies that effectively eradicate LSCs and is currently a focus of extensive research. To date, evidence obtained from in vitro studies, animal models, and clinical CML specimens suggests that an effective approach may be to partner existing BCR-ABL inhibitors with compounds targeting key stem cell molecular effectors, including Wnt/β-catenin, hedgehog pathway components, histone deacetylase (HDAC), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), Janus kinase 2, promyelocytic leukemia protein, and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5).

In addition to Bcl-2, is a protein essential for transformation by BCR-ABL. However, it is not known how Bcl-2 and Ras fit together in cell transformation by BCR-ABL. The data presented here establish that Bcl-2 is a downstream target gene of the Ras signalling pathway in cells transformed by BCR-ABL, and that constitutive Ras activation results in constitutive expression of the gene. Conversely, a truncated form of the BCR-ABL, which lacks a critical BCR region required for activation of the Ras signalling pathway, failed to induce Bcl-2 expression. These results indicate that BCR-ABL prevents apoptosis by inducing Bcl-2 through a signalling pathway involving Ras and links constitutive Ras activation and Bcl-2 gene regulation.

Chronic myeloid leukemia was the first malignancy to be linked to a clear genetic anomaly, the Philadelphia chromosome and, at present, it is probably the best understood of all human malignancies. Studies of the disease pathology revealed that the molecular consequence of the Philadelphia translocation is a BCR-ABL chimeric gene, which encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase with wholesale range of biological activities. Animal models have validated the direct role of the BCR-ABL protein in malignant transformation and subsequent research confirmed that its enhanced tyrosine kinase activity is essential and sufficient for the leukemogenesis. The very existence of a single genetic abnormality, presented in essentially all patients with the disease, made it an effective target for molecularly designed therapeutic approaches for the disease. The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, designed specifically to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein, represents one of the major innovations in cancer therapy and may serve as a model for, how discoveries of disease pathogenesis may be translated into the development of successful targeted therapies in cancer medicine.",

However, resistance to imatinib develops frequently, particularly in late-stage disease. To identify new cellular BCR-ABL downstream targets, we analyzed differences in global protein expression in BCR-ABL-positive K562 cells treated with or without imatinib in vitro. Among the 19 proteins found to be differentially expressed, we detected the down-regulation of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), a protein essential for cell proliferation. eIF5A represents the only known eukaryotic protein activated by posttranslational hypusination. Hypusination inhibitors (HIs) alone exerted an antiproliferative effect on BCR-ABL-positive and -negative leukemia cell lines in vitro. However, the synergistic dose-response relationship found for the combination of imatinib and HI was restricted to Bcr-Abl-positive cells. Furthermore, this synergistic effect was confirmed by cytotoxicity assays, cell-cycle analysis, and CFSE labeling of primary CD34+ CML cells. Specificity of this effect could be demonstrated by cotreatment of K562 cells with imatinib and siRNA against eIF5. In conclusion, through a comparative proteomics approach and further functional analysis, we identified the inhibition of eIF5A hypusination as a promising new approach for combination therapy in BCR-ABL-positive leukemias.",

Due to their higher life expectancy, the number of patients is on the increase and their quality of life and working capacity remain good. According to the All-Russian Register of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, there were more than 6500 cases in the Russian Federation in 2012.

The efficiency and safety of TKI therapy have been well studied. The most important principle of treatment is to permanently affect the Ph'-positive tumor cell clone by the long-term daily use of TKls. Regular cytogenetic and molecular genetic monitoring allows adequate estimation of the leukemic clone volume and it is essential in evaluating the therapeutic effectiveness.

Many different signal transduction pathways are activated by Bcr-Abl, but little is known about their downstream targets in specific cell lineages. We show here that Ph-positive cell lines as well as primary cells derived from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in lymphoid blast crisis or from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) consistently express high levels of cyclin D2, whereas expression of this protein is low or absent in comparable Ph-negative lines and Ph-positive myeloid lines. Inhibition of Bcr-Abl with STI571 resulted in down-regulation of cyclin D2 and reduction of the number of cells in S phase, although complete G1 arrest was not induced. The expression of cyclin D2 in Ph-positive lymphoblasts was mediated via the phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase pathway. Analogous results were seen in murine BaF/3 cells transfected with a BCR-ABL expression vector. In contrast to the human cell lines, murine Baf/BCR-ABL cells exposed to STI571 inhibitor were all arrested in G1. This arrest could be abrogated by exogenous expression of cyclin D2 from a transfected cDNA construct. We conclude that a direct connection exists between Bcr-Abl PTK activity and cell cycle progression in which cyclin D2 plays a critical role. However, cell cycle progression in human Ph-positive lymphoid cells is not entirely dependent on Bcr-Abl PTK, and additional genetic lesions must be present.",

Because of its ability to mimic the proliferative and cell survival functions of hematopoietic growth factors, we hypothesized that the oncogene activated in CML, BCR-ABL, might also influence differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of expressing BCR-ABL on the myeloid differentiation of murine M1 leukemic cells, which cease dividing and differentiate into macrophages in the presence of the cytokines leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or interleukin (IL)-6. We found that BCR-ABL induced macrophage differentiation in M1 cells, accompanied by increased expression of macrophage cell surface markers and the acquisition of phagocytic ability. interestingly, clones of M1 cells which expressed BCR-ABL remained in cell cycle and were refractory to the growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by IL-6 or LIF in parental M1 cells. These cells also expressed inappropriately high levels of c-MYC mRNA for their degree of differentiation, which may have been important in maintaining cellular proliferation.

Southern blot analysis using bcr probes, however, suggests that Ph1-positive ALL includes heterogeneous leukemic subtypes: six ALL patients showed bcr rearrangements as observed in CML; in three other patients recombination involving 5' bcr sequences could be demonstrated, but the corresponding translocated 3' bcr sequences were not detectable. A third group of five patients did not show any bcr rearrangements at all. Northern blot analysis using RNA from three Ph1-positive ALL patients revealed that in the leukemic cells of two patients larger c-abl mRNA transcripts were present, as in CML. In the RNA of one patient without a detectable bcr rearrangement, only the normal c-abl mRNA transcripts are present. The observed heterogeneity in bcr rearrangements of this group of Ph1-positive ALL patients is in contrast with the consistent results obtained in more than 50 Ph1-positive CML patients investigated in chronic and acute states.",

In this study, we supplemented mice with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5), a polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid, at pharmacologic levels, to examine whether the endogenous metabolite, cyclopentenone prostaglandin delta-12 PGJ3 (Δ(12)-PGJ3), was effective in targeting LSCs in experimental leukemia. EPA supplementation for 8 weeks resulted in enhanced endogenous production of Δ(12)-PGJ3 that was blocked by indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor. Using a murine model of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) induced by bone marrow transplantation of BCR-ABL-expressing hematopoietic stem cells, mice supplemented with EPA showed a decrease in the LSC population, and reduced splenomegaly and leukocytosis, when compared with mice on an oleic acid diet. Supplementation of CML mice carrying the T315I mutation (in BCR-ABL) with EPA resulted in a similar effect. Indomethacin blocked the EPA effect and increased the severity of BCR-ABL-induced CML and decreased apoptosis. Δ(12)-PGJ3 rescued indomethacin-treated BCR-ABL mice and decreased LSCs. Inhibition of hematopoietic-prostaglandin D synthase (H-PGDS) by HQL-79 in EPA-supplemented CML mice also blocked the effect of EPA. In addition, EPA supplementation was effective in a murine model of acute myeloid leukemia. EPA-supplemented mice exhibited a decrease in leukemia burden and a decrease in the LSC colony-forming unit (LSC-CFU). The decrease in LSCs was confirmed through serial transplantation assays in all disease models. The results support a chemopreventive role for EPA in myeloid leukemia, which is dependent on the ability to efficiently convert EPA to endogenous COX-derived prostanoids, including Δ(12)-PGJ3.",

Studies from this laboratory and others have shown that virtually all patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia have this new bcr/abl fusion gene. In contrast to these findings in chronic myelogenous leukemia, a small number of patients with Ph1(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have been studied and were found to lack the bcr/abl fusion gene [bcr(-)], but to have a new activation of abl, by recombination with an as yet undetermined region on chromosome 22.

Leukemic blast cells from eight patients with B-precursor ALL, including three patients with BCR-ABL-positive ALL, were cultured on monolayers of MS-5 cells for 3 weeks with or without addition of variable amounts of STI571. In all cases, cobblestone areas (CAs) were formed, showing clear linear cell dose-dependent curves, allowing quantitative assessment of blast cell growth. The progenitor frequencies obtained by this direct CA-forming cell (CAFC) assay were equivalent to ALL progenitor frequencies assessed by the standard limiting dilution assay. The number of CAFCs ranged from 12.3 to 140.3/10(4) cells. In BCR-ABL-positive ALL patients, CA-containing cells were examined by FISH, and all contained BCR-ABL fusion genes. STI571 inhibited CA formation of BCR-ABL-positive ALL cells virtually 100% at 0.1-1.0 micromol/l.

Comprehensive enzymatic digestion analysis showed that 10 out of the 28 HLA class I binding fusion peptides were efficiently excised after their C-terminus by the proteasome, which is an essential requirement for efficient cell surface expression. Therefore, these peptides are prime vaccine candidates. The other peptides either completely lacked C-terminal liberation or were only inefficiently excised by the proteasome, rendering them inappropriate or less suitable for inclusion in a vaccine. CTL raised against the properly processed HLA-B61 epitope AEALQRPVA from the BCR-ABL e1a2 fusion region, expressed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), specifically recognized ALL tumor cells, proving cell surface presentation of this epitope, its applicability for immunotherapy and underlining the accuracy of our epitope identification strategy.

Thus, it is urgent to develop novel therapeutic strategies to overcome TKI-resistance. The anti-rheumatic gold (I) compound Auranofin (AF), was recently approved by US Food and Drug Administration for Phase II clinical trials to treat leukemia.

T315I mutation (resulting in substitution of Ile for a Thr residue at the \"gatekeeper\" position 315) raises particular concern, because it also provides resistance to second-generation kinase inhibitors already approved for clinical use (nilotinib and dasatinib). Much effort is therefore focused on alternative molecular-based strategies. Previous studies proved that binding to 14-3-3 scaffolding proteins leads to cytoplasmic compartmentalization and suppression of proapoptotic and antiproliferative signals associated with Bcr-Abl protein kinase, hence contributing to leukemic clone expansion. Here we investigated the effect of 14-3-3 inhibition disruption on hematopoietic cells expressing the IM-sensitive wild type Bcr-Abl and the IM-resistant T315I mutation. Using a virtual screening protocol and docking simulations, we identified a nonpeptidic inhibitor of 14-3-3, named BV02, that exhibits a remarkable cytotoxicity against both cell types. c-Abl release from 14-3-3σ, promoting its relocation to nuclear compartment (where it triggers transcription of p73-dependent proapoptotic genes) and to mitochondrial membranes (where it induces the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential) combined with c-Abl enhanced association with caspase 9 (a critical step of sequential caspase activation further contributing to c-Abl pro-apoptotic function) has a prominent role in the effect of BV02 on Bcr-Abl-expressing cells. In conclusion, BV02 may be considered as a treatment option for CML and, in particular, for more advanced phases of the disease that developed IM resistance as a consequence of Bcr-Abl point mutations.",

First, the BCR/ABL rearrangement was identified as the molecular basis of the disease. Second, animal models support the notion that the BCR/ABL gene product causes a syndrome similar to CML. Third, recent advances in understanding the functions of the normal ABL protein have given clues to the mechanism(s) of ABL-induced leukemias and approaches to blocking this process. Extrapolating these findings to humans seems reasonable. The challenge now is to determine how the BCR/ABL gene product causes chronic phase CML. Also unresolved is whether BCR/ABL also plays a role in the acute phase of the disease. Finally, the relationship between the two common forms of BCR/ABL, the P190 and P210 configurations, and different disease phenotypes, like CML and Philadelphia (Ph1)-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), needs to be clarified. There is also substantial progress in treating CML. Bone marrow transplants have emerged as the preferred therapy. These result in long-term leukemia-free survival in more than one-half of appropriately selected subjects. How transplants cure CML is complex and controversial. Some data suggest high-dose treatment is the dominant factor whereas other data implicate antileukemia effects of the immune system. Interferon treatment has also proven effective in CML. Whether it prolongs survival of persons with CML remains to be determined, as does its mechanism of action. Certainly the most important and difficult challenge in CML therapy is determining how to use knowledge about the causes CML to treat the disease. These and other issues in the biology and therapy of CML were the subject of a recent meeting of basic and clinical scientists. The meeting, third in a series begun in 1987, was held on Martha's Vineyard, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA from 4-7 April, 1992.

Most commonly these deletion mutants lack a significant portion of the kinase domain that includes the P-loop. We describe a screen for such mutations in patients with CML and demonstrate that they are not oncogenic and are catalytically inactive. We hypothesized that coexpressing BCR-ABL deletion mutants has a dominant-negative effect on the native form through heterocomplex formation. However, upon coexpression of native and deletion mutant BCR-ABL in Ba/F3 cells, growth factor independence is maintained and signaling is activated normally. Despite this, these cells have increased imatinib sensitivity compared to cells expressing only native BCR-ABL. Thus, it will be important to investigate the prognostic impact of coexpression of deletion mutants in CML patients during imatinib treatment.",

In this study, we show that human homolog double minute 2 (HDM2) inhibition, with MI-219-a novel compound, and consequently p53 stabilization induce chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis cells to undergo apoptosis regardless of the presence of the T315I mutation in the BCR-ABL kinase domain. The response to MI-219 is associated with the downregulation of c-Myc and the induction of p21(WAF1). The p53 target and pro-apoptotic proteins PUMA, Noxa and Bax are induced, whereas full length Bid protein decreases with increased activity of pro-apoptotic cleaved Bid, and decrease of Mcl-1 is observed by increased caspase activity. CD95/FAS (FAS antigen) receptor is also induced by MI-219, indicating that both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic responses are transcriptionally induced. In addition, p53 protein accumulates in the mitochondrial fraction of treated cells involved in transcription-independent induction of apoptosis.

BCR-ABL-expressing CML cells compete with normal hematopoietic cells over the limited space in the bone marrow to proliferate. Moreover, CML cells can gain resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors by utilizing bone marrow microenvironments. Thus, in order to develop a novel treatment strategy for CML, it is necessary to elucidate the cellular and molecular basis underlying the interactions between CML and normal hematopoietic cells. Herein, we discuss the roles of chemokines, particularly CXCL12 and CCL3, in reconstruction processes of bone marrow microenvironments by CML cells and the possibility of novel treatment modalities against CML, based on targeting these chemokines.

We used real-time PCR and ABL1 kinase domain sequencing on sequential samples from 11 patients with Philadelphia-positive leukemias who received dasatinib. We were able to detect pre-existing mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 in four patients, particularly in patients with high BCR-ABL1 transcript levels.

Whereas imatinib, a selective inhibitor of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, is now used in frontline therapy for CML, second-generation inhibitors of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase such as nilotinib or dasatinib have been developed for the treatment of imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant disease. In the current study, we generated nilotinib-resistant cell lines and investigated their mechanism of resistance. Overexpression of BCR-ABL and multidrug resistance gene (MDR-1) were found among the investigated mechanisms. We showed that nilotinib is a substrate of the multidrug resistance gene product, P-glycoprotein, using verapamil or PSC833 to block binding. Up-regulated expression of p53/56 Lyn kinase, both at the mRNA and protein level, was found in one of the resistant cell lines and Lyn silencing by small interfering RNA restored sensitivity to nilotinib. Moreover, failure of nilotinib treatment was accompanied by an increase of Lyn mRNA expression in patients with resistant CML. Two Src kinase inhibitors (PP1 and PP2) partially removed resistance but did not significantly inhibit Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity. In contrast, dasatinib, a dual Bcr-Abl and Src kinase inhibitor, inhibited the phosphorylation of both BCR-ABL and Lyn, and induced apoptosis of the Bcr-Abl cell line overexpressing p53/56 Lyn. Such mechanisms of resistance are close to those observed in imatinib-resistant cell lines and emphasize the critical role of Lyn in nilotinib resistance.",

These observations have in recent years been supported by laboratory results indicating the presence of CML-specific T cells in the lymphocyte repertoire of both normal healthy individuals and disease-bearing patients. Both MHC-unrestricted and MHC-restricted immune effector mechanisms are involved. Donor lymphocyte infusion has produced encouraging GvL effects. However, future adoptive immunotherapy may depend on the isolation and generation of leukemia-specific T cells. Although many proteins may potentially act as leukemia antigens in CML for MHC-restricted cytotoxicity, the bcr-abl fusion protein has been most extensively investigated. There is now much evidence to suggest that the bcr-abl junctional peptides are capable of eliciting both CD4 and CD8 responses in normal healthy donors and CML patients. Furthermore, the T-cell lines generated react with autologous or HLA-matched fresh CML cells, suggesting that the bcr-abl fusion protein can be processed in vivo so that the joining segment is bound to HLA molecules in a configuration and concentration similar to those of the immunizing peptide for antigen recognition by the antigen-specific T-cell receptor. These results also indicate that the bcr-abl junctional peptides may be used for immunotherapy of CML. Other strategies available for immunotherapy of CML include immunologically or genetically manipulated donor T-cell infusion, the use of cytokines, adoptive immunotherapy with leukemia-reactive T-cells expanded ex vivo, and immune gene therapy. Novel and rational immunotherapy may therefore play an important adjuvant role in future in the management of patients with CML.",

Here, we adapted a murine retroviral BMT model of Philadelphia(+) leukemia by combining allogeneic bone marrow (BM) from C57Bl/6 (H-2(b)) mice with BCR-ABL-transduced Balb/c (H-2(d)) BM, inducing mixed chimerism and myeloproliferative disease in recipients resembling relapse of CML following allogeneic BMT. Infusions of allogeneic splenocytes eliminated BCR-ABL-induced CML-like disease in the majority of mixed chimeras, with significant GvL effects mediated by both CD4(+) and CD4(-) cells. BCR-ABL-induced acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia was also eradicated by DLI in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched chimeras. Most DLI-treated mice converted to full allogeneic chimerism but succumbed frequently to GvHD or graft failure. When MHC-matched B10.D2 (H-2(d)) mice were the allogeneic donors, CML-like disease was more resistant to DLI. These results suggest that depletion of CD8(+) cells from DLI could impair GvL against CML, while increased MHC disparity between donor and recipient may improve the responsiveness of Philadelphia(+) B-lymphoblastic leukemia to DLI.",

Most notable is the inhibitor imatinib, which produces remissions in all phases of CML and is the current standard of care. However, imatinib resistance occurs in a significant proportion of patients, mainly through the development of mutations in the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase domain that impair imatinib binding. Attempts to circumvent resistance to imatinib led to the discovery of nilotinib (Tasigna; Novartis AG), a novel, potent and selective oral Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor. Preclinical and clinical investigations have demonstrated that nilotinib effectively overcomes imatinib resistance. Efficacy has been observed in models of CML and other myeloproliferative disorders that are driven by Bcr-Abl and related kinases. In a phase II clinical trial in CML, major cytogenetic response rates were 52 and 33% for chronic- and accelerated-phase disease, respectively. Nilotinib has been filed for approval in the US and EU for use in Philadelphia-positive leukemias in patients who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib.

This phase is followed after 4-6 years by rapid progression, an accelerated phase, and consequently a fatal acute leukemia a blast crisis. The hallmark abnormality of CML is the Philadelphia chromosome that generates a BCR-ABL fusion gene, resulting in the expression of a leukemia-specific oncoprotein, Bcr-Abl. Bcr-Abl is a potent tyrosine kinase and plays a central role in CML pathogenesis. Recently, the treatment of CML has been revolutionized by the introduction of imatinib mesylate(IM). With daily IM treatment, more than 80% of chronic-phase CML patients achieve a complete cytogenetic response. Nevertheless, a small percentage of CML patients are primarily refractory or acquire secondary resistance against IM. Nilotinib is a highly selective Abl kinase inhibitor that possesses greater potency and selectivity for Abl kinase than IM. In addition to being more potent than IM against wild-type BCR-ABL, nilotinib is significantly active against many IM-resistant BCR-ABL mutants. In preclinical studies, nilotinib has produced hematologic and cytogenetic responses in CML patients, with either IM resistance or IM intolerance. As second-line treatment, both nilotinib and dasatinib may be used in case of suboptimal response or failure, which is defined in the efficacy criteria of the European Leukemia Net Consensus. The choice of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be made after the mutation analyses of the kinase domain. It is recommended that nilotinib or dasatinib whichever was shown to be active against the specific mutation, should be chosen for treatment. For patients with no mutations or patients with IM intolerance, it is recommended that either second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor be chosen, based on the patient's disease history.",

These molecular phenomena may occur even in the absence of cytogenetic evidence of the Ph translocation. They are highly specific and sensitive markers for CML, and are presumed to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of this malignancy. Surprisingly, we have encountered 11 patients who lacked the Ph translocation, bcr rearrangement, and (in the four patients with available mRNA) a bcr-abl message, and yet had a disease phenotype at diagnosis that was a morphologic facsimile of classic chronic phase CML. These patients presented with high white blood cell counts, neutrophilia, occasional basophilia, splenomegaly, and a hypercellular bone marrow with granulocytic hyperplasia and a left shift in myeloid maturation. Despite the striking resemblance between the early stages of bcr-negative and bcr-positive CML, disease progression manifests distinctly in these two disorders. In contrast to the blastic transformation that inevitably complicates bcr-positive CML, the natural history of our 11 Ph-negative, bcr-negative CML patients was characterized by increasing leukemia burden with leukocytosis, pronounced organomegaly, extramedullary infiltrates, and eventual bone marrow failure (anemia and thrombocytopenia) without marked increases in blast cells. Our current observations suggest that a chronic myeloid leukemia process can develop without associated changes in the bcr or c-abl genes.

Dramatic results from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) clinical trials spurred the development of TKIs for other malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia as well as kidney and lung cancer. In CML, imatinib resistance led to the rapid development of dasatinib and nilotinib, more potent second-generation ABL kinase inhibitors that can often overcome imatinib resistance. While the clinical efficacy of TKIs in CML is well established, a number of important questions remain about the optimal dose and duration of therapy. Even the best initial dose for imatinib is still under investigation. Although laboratory and clinical studies had led to the prevailing view that continual inhibition of the BCR-ABL kinase was required for optimal efficacy, recent data on dasatinib have upended this notion and have led to a change in the recommended dosing schedule. The availability of dasatinib and nilotinib also begs the question of whether they might be superior to imatinib as first-line agents. Finally, the question of whether it may be possible to stop TKI therapy at least in some patients with CML has attracted considerable attention. More than 10 years after the introduction of imatinib, optimization of TKI therapy for CML continues.",

The majority of patients can now expect to live a normal life as long as they continue to comply with TKI treatment. However, in a significant proportion of cases TKI resistance develops over time, requiring a switch of therapy. The most frequent mechanism for drug resistance is the development of kinase domain mutations that reduce or completely ablate drug efficacy.

These observations indicate that TKI-insensitive LSCs and TKI-sensitive leukemic progenitor cells are biologically different, which leads us to believe that LSCs and more differentiated leukemic cells have different genetic mechanisms. Further study of LSCs to identify the novel gene signatures and mechanisms that control the function and molecular phenotype of LSCs is critical. In this mini-review, we will discuss our current understanding of the biology of LSCs and novel genes that could serve as a molecular signature of LSCs in CML.

We report the outcome of 45 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia who underwent myeloablative single unit cord blood transplantation from unrelated donors within the GETH/GITMO cooperative group. Conditioning regimens were based on combinations of thiotepa, busulfan, cyclophospamide or fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin. At the time of transplantation, 35 patients (78%) were in first complete remission, four (8%) in second complete remission and six (14%) in third or subsequent response. The cumulative incidence of myeloid engraftment was 96% at a median time of 20 days and significantly better for patients receiving higher doses of CD34(+) cells. The incidence of acute grade II-IV graft-versus-host disease was 31%, while that of overall chronic graft-versus-host disease was 53%. Treatment-related mortality was 17% at day +100 and 31% at 5 years. The 5-year relapse, event-free survival and overall survival rates were 31%, 36% and 44%, respectively. Although the event-free and overall survival rates in patients without BCR/ABL transcripts detectable at time of transplant were better than those in whom BCR/ABL transcripts were detected (46% versus 24% and 60% versus 30%, respectively) these differences were not statistically significant in the univariate analysis (P=0.07).

Histone methylation was found even in \"cured\" patients without Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) resulting from +(9;22)(q34;q11) BCR/ABL translocation, suggesting an incomplete process of developmentally regulated chromatin remodeling in the granulocytes of these patients.

Thus, our study shows for the first time that histone H3 methylation may be changed dramatically during normal cell differentiation.

Here, we examined the activity of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor SCH66336 as a single chemotherapeutic agent in a nude mouse model representative of very advanced stage Bcr/Abl P190-positive lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Our results show that oral administration of the inhibitor was able to significantly increase the survival of these mice compared to controls treated with vehicle (P<0.005), and caused marked regression of the tumor burden in the treated mice. Upon prolonged treatment, lymphomas re-emerged and a subset of cells from two of such lymphomas tested was able to survive in the presence of increased concentrations of SCH66336. The same cells, however, remained sensitive towards imatinib. A combination of the two drugs, preceded by a therapy to reduce the initial tumor burden, could be very effective in the treatment of Ph-positive ALL.

This rearrangement is known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The molecular consequence of this translocation is the generation of a BCR-ABL1 fusion oncogene, which in turn translates into a BCR-ABL oncoprotein. Frontline therapy: Three tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for first-line treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CML-CP). Clinical trials with 2nd generation TKIs reported significantly deeper and faster responses; their impact on long-term survival remains to be determined. Salvage therapy: For patients who fail frontline therapy, second-line options include second and third generation TKIs. Although second and third generation TKIs are potent and selective TKIs, they exhibit unique pharmacological profiles and response patterns relative to different patient and disease characteristics, such as patients' comorbidities, disease stage, and BCR-ABL1 mutational status. Patients who develop the T315I \"gatekeeper\" mutation display resistance to all currently available TKIs except ponatinib.

We now report that direct activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by the phorbol ester PMA in the BCR-ABL(+) CML cell line K562 and primary CML blasts induced nonterminal differentiation into cells with typical DC morphology (cytoplasmic dendrites), characteristic surface markers (MHC class I, MHC class II, CD86, CD40), chemokine and transcription factor expression, and ability to stimulate T cell proliferation (equivalent to normal monocyte-derived DC). PKC-induced differentiation was associated with down-regulation of BCR-ABL mRNA expression, protein levels, and kinase activity. This down-regulation appeared to be signaled through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Therefore, PKC-driven differentiation of CML blasts into DC-like cells suggests a potentially novel strategy to down-regulate BCR-ABL activity, yet raises the possibility that CML-derived DC vaccines will be less effective in presenting leukemia-specific Ags.",

Using mouse genetics and a BCR-ABL model of CML, we observed cross talk between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and the interferon-regulatory factor 8 (Irf8). In normal hematopoiesis, activation of β-catenin results in up-regulation of Irf8, which in turn limits oncogenic β-catenin functions. Self-renewal and myeloproliferation become dependent on β-catenin in Irf8-deficient animals that develop a CML-like disease. Combined Irf8 deletion and constitutive β-catenin activation result in progression of CML into fatal blast crisis, elevated leukemic potential of BCR-ABL-induced LICs, and Imatinib resistance. Interestingly, activated β-catenin enhances a preexisting Irf8-deficient gene signature, identifying β-catenin as an amplifier of progression-specific gene regulation in the shift of CML to blast crisis. Collectively, our data uncover Irf8 as a roadblock for β-catenin-driven leukemia and imply both factors as targets in combinatorial therapy. ",

BCR-ABL is a functional oncoprotein p210 that exhibits constitutively activated tyrosine kinase causing genomic alteration of hematopoietic stem cells. BCR-ABL specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) successfully block CML progression. However, drug resistance owing to BCR-ABL mutations and overexpression is still an issue. Heat-shock proteins (Hsps) function as molecular chaperones facilitating proper folding of nascent polypeptides. Their increased expression under stressful conditions protects cells by stabilizing unfolded or misfolded peptides. Hsp90 is the major mammalian protein and is required by BCR-ABL for stabilization and maturation. Hsp90 inhibitors destabilize the binding of BCR-ABL protein thus leading to the formation of heteroprotein complex that is eventually degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Results of many novel Hsp90 inhibitors that have entered into various clinical trials are encouraging. The present review targets the current development in the CML treatment by availing Hsp90 specific inhibitors. ",

The oncogenic product of this aberrant chromosome is the constitutively active tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL that is responsible for leukemic cell growth, proliferation and survival driven by the dysregulation of a large array of signal transduction pathways. Inhibition of BCR-ABL with tyrosine kinase inhibitors proved to be an efficient therapy of CML in the chronic phase. Unfortunately, the impressive success of BCR-ABL inhibitors as front-line therapy in CML has been tempered by problems of disease persistence or relapse arising from different mechanisms, including mutations in the kinase domain of the enzyme BCRABL and mechanisms independent from BCR-ABL activity. Growing evidence has also suggested a pivotal role of persistent leukemic cancer stem cells, characterized by high self-renewal and pluripotency, in CML maintenance and/or relapse.

Mice were observed until development of progressive ALL. Although obese and control BCR/ABL mice had similar median survival, older obese mice had accelerated ALL onset, implying a time-dependent effect of obesity on ALL. Obese AKR mice developed ALL significantly earlier than controls. The effect of obesity was not explained by WBC count, thymus/spleen weight, or ALL phenotype. However, obese AKR mice had higher leptin, insulin, and interleukin-6 levels than controls, and these obesity-related hormones all have potential roles in leukemia pathogenesis. In conclusion, obesity directly accelerates presentation of ALL, likely by increasing the risk of an early event in leukemogenesis. This is the first study to show that obesity can directly accelerate the progression of ALL.

In the transgenic model, after retransplantation, donor-derived CML stem cells in which Bcr-Abl expression had been induced and subsequently shut off were able to persist in vivo and reinitiate leukemia in secondary recipients on Bcr-Abl reexpression. Bcr-Abl knockdown in human CD34(+) CML cells cultured for 12 days in physiologic growth factors achieved partial inhibition of Bcr-Abl and downstream targets p-CrkL and p-STAT5, inhibition of proliferation and colony forming cells, but no reduction of input cells. The addition of dasatinib further inhibited p-CrkL and p-STAT5, yet only reduced input cells by 50%. Complete growth factor withdrawal plus dasatinib further reduced input cells to 10%; however, the surviving fraction was enriched for primitive leukemic cells capable of growth in a long-term culture-initiating cell assay and expansion on removal of dasatinib and addition of growth factors.

Understanding the molecular basis of CML has led to the development of highly effective targeted therapies that block Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity. Imatinib, the current first-line therapy for CML, induces durable treatment responses in most patients. However, patients may develop imatinib resistance, which is often due to BCR-ABL mutations. With the availability of second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, an effective therapeutic option other than stem cell transplantation is available following imatinib failure. Randomized trial data suggest that dasatinib treatment is superior to imatinib dose escalation in patients with imatinib resistance. Nilotinib, a recently approved analogue of imatinib, has also demonstrated encouraging treatment responses in patients with imatinib-resistant CML. Other agents (including bosutinib and INNO-406) are in clinical development. With the potential availability of multiple treatment options for patients with CML, it may be possible to tailor treatment according to individual patient or disease characteristics, for example, BCR-ABL mutations. Future CML treatment may involve combination strategies. Overall, targeted agents have significantly improved the prognosis of patients diagnosed with CML.",

About 50% of Ph+ ALL cases, in contrast to CML, do not exhibit chromosomal breakpoints in the major cluster region or mcr (Ph+ mcr- ALL). These cases may have a novel bcr-abl fusion gene instead. We tested this hypothesis in eight Ph+ mcr- ALL patients by amplifying the putative hybrid part of the bcr-abl cDNA, using the polymerase chain reaction method. All cases examined showed the same joining of the first exon of the bcr gene to the c-abl oncogene. Thus, the novel bcr-abl fusion in Ph+ mcr- ALL is the result of a molecularly distinct Ph chromosome. This allows the definition of Ph+ leukemias by their respective bcr-abl oncogene activation. Moreover, the cDNA amplification method we use is a clinically useful tool to screen for bcr-abl oncogene activations in leukemia patients.",

This mechanism involves the consistent and selective activation of IL-3 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) production and a stimulation of STAT5 phosphorylation in CD34(+) leukemic cells. When these cells differentiate into CD34(-) cells in vivo, IL-3 and G-CSF production declines, and the cells concomitantly lose their capacity for autonomous growth in vitro despite their continued expression of BCR-ABL. Based on previous studies of normal cells, excessive exposure of the most primitive chronic myeloid leukemia cells to IL-3 and G-CSF through an autocrine mechanism could explain their paradoxically decreased self-renewal in vitro and slow accumulation in vivo, in spite of an increased cycling activity and selective expansion of later compartments.",

Second-generation Bcr-Abl inhibitors are capable to overcome resistance mediated by most mutations except T315I. As this mutation is causative for approximately 20% of clinically observed resistances, the need for novel treatment strategies becomes obvious. Here, we report on a novel kinase inhibitor PHA-680626 exhibiting strong inhibitory activity on both Bcr-Abl and Aurora kinases. Significant anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects were observed in human BCR-ABL positive cell lines and murine BaF3 cells ectopically expressing wt BCR-ABL or the Imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants M351T, E255K and, T315I. Treatment with PHA-680626 decreased phosphorylation of CrkL and histone H3. As CrkL represents a typical downstream target of Bcr-Abl while histone H3 phosphorylation is an indicator for Aurora kinase B activity, these findings indicate that effects of PHA-680626 are mediated via inhibition of both pathways. Moreover, high anti-proliferative activity of PHA-680626 was observed in primary CD34+ cells derived from CML patients at diagnosis or in blast crisis as well as from an individual harbouring the T315I mutation. Thus, both Bcr-Abl and Aurora kinase inhibition contribute to the efficacy of PHA-680626 against Imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL positive leukemias, particularly those harbouring the T315I mutation.",

However, the same dose of herbimycin A did not inhibit in vitro growth of a broad spectrum of Ph1-negative human leukemia cells, and several other protein kinase antagonists also displayed no preferential inhibition. Furthermore, we demonstrated that herbimycin A has an antagonizing effect on the growth of transformed cells by a transfection of retroviral amphotrophic vector expressing P210bcr/abl into a murine interleukin (IL)-3-dependent myeloid FDC-P2 cell line. This inhibition was abrogated by the addition of sulfhydryl compounds, similar to the reaction previously described for Rous sarcoma virus transformation. The inhibitory effect of herbimycin A on the growth of Ph1-positive cells was associated with decreased bcr/abl tyrosine kinase activity, but no decrease of bcr-abl mRNA and protein, suggesting that the inactivation of bcr-abl tyrosine kinase activity by herbimycin A may be induced by its binding to the bcr-abl protein portion that is rich with sulfhydryl groups.

Identification of the BCR-ABL kinase fusion protein and its central role in the pathogenesis of CML provided new opportunities to develop rational molecular targeted therapies. This review provides an update on the underlying pathophysiologies of disease progression and imatinib mesylate resistance, leading to the development of new targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors for managing CML. Imatinib, a selective inhibitor of BCR-ABL, represents a major success in the era of target-directed cancer chemotherapy. However, patients with advanced CML have been less sensitive to therapy and responses have been short. In addition, treatment resistance is an emerging problem at all disease stages. Insight into factors involved in imatinib resistance and disease progression has highlighted a role for such BCR-ABL-dependent factors as amplification and overexpression of the BCR-ABL gene and the emergence of mutant isoforms of BCR-ABL. However, BCR-ABL-independent factors, including leukemogenic pathways involving kinases other than BCR-ABL, also play a part. In light of the limitations of imatinib against these factors, newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including dasatinib (a multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and Src family kinases) and nilotinib (AMN107, a selective BCR-ABL inhibitor), may provide promising treatment options for patients with CML.",

It therefore represents a challenging disease for T-cell immunotherapeutics. The CD19/CD3 bi-specific antibody construct blinatumomab (AMG103 or MT103) has been tested clinically in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia but has not been assessed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We investigated whether blinatumomab could overcome T-cell dysfunction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia in vitro. Blinatumomab was tested on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 28 patients (treatment naïve and previously treated). T-cell activation and function, as well as cytotoxicity against leukemic tumor cells were measured. Blinatumomab induced T-cell activation, proliferation, cytokine secretion and granzyme B release in a manner similar to that occurring with stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads. However, only blinatumomab was able to induce tumor cell death and this was found to require blinatumomab-mediated conjugate formation between T cells and tumor cells. Cytotoxicity of tumor cells was observed at very low T-cell:tumor cell ratios. A three-dimensional model based on confocal microscopy suggested that up to 11 tumor cells could cluster round each T cell. Importantly, blinatumomab induced cytotoxicity against tumor cells in samples from both treatment-naïve and treated patients, and in the presence of co-culture pro-survival signals. The potent cytotoxic action of blinatumomab on tumor cells appears to involve conjugation of T cells with tumor cells at both the activation and effector stages. The efficacy of blinatumomab in vitro suggests that the bi-specific antibody approach may be a powerful immunotherapeutic strategy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. ",

Co‑treatment of K562r cells with subtoxic concentrations of As2O3 (2 µM) and BTZ (24 nM) resulted in a synergistic enhancement in growth inhibition and apoptosis, as demonstrated by increased annexin V staining. These events were associated with activation of protein kinase Cδ, poly ADP‑ribose polymerase cleavage and caspase‑3 activation, along with downregulation of Bcr/Abl mRNA and Bcr/Abl protein expression levels during apoptosis.

HS-543 showed anti-proliferative effects in the BaF3/WT cells as well as the BaF3/T315I cells with resistance to Imatinib and strongly inhibited the Bcr-Abl signaling pathway in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, it significantly increased the sub G1 phase associated with early apoptosis, with increased levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3, as well as the TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells. In addition, we found that HS-543 induced apoptosis with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential by decreasing the expression of Mcl-1 and survivin, together with increasing that of Bax. In BaF3/T315I xenograft models, HS-543 significantly delayed tumor growth, unlike Imatinib. Our results demonstrate that HS-543 exhibits the induction of apoptosis and anti-proliferative effect by blocking the Bcr-Abl signaling pathway in the T315I-mutated Bcr-Abl cells with resistance to Imatinib.

However, therapeutic effects of radotinib in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that radotinib significantly decreases the viability of AML cells in a dose-dependent manner. Kasumi-1 cells were more sensitive to radotinib than NB4, HL60, or THP-1 cell lines. Furthermore, radotinib induced CD11b expression in NB4, THP-1, and Kasumi-1 cells either in presence or absence of all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). We found that radotinib promoted differentiation and induced CD11b expression in AML cells by downregulating LYN. However, CD11b expression induced by ATRA in HL60 cells was decreased by radotinib through upregulation of LYN. Furthermore, radotinib mainly induced apoptosis of CD11b+ cells in the total population of AML cells. Radotinib also increased apoptosis of CD11b+ HL60 cells when they were differentiated by ATRA/dasatinib treatment. We show that radotinib induced apoptosis via caspase-3 activation and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in CD11b+ cells differentiated from AML cells. Our results suggest that radotinib may be used as a candidate drug in AML or a chemosensitizer for treatment of AML by other therapeutics. ",

When cell lines and clinical samples were studied together, we found that each chromosomal abnormality (TEL/AML1, BCR/ABL, or MLL abnormalities) was associated with a characteristic gene expression signature that was shared by both cell lines and clinical samples. However, BCR/ABL was associated with a much more heterogeneous pattern of expression than were TEL/AML1 and MLL abnormalities. This observation has important implications for the study of BCR/ABL ALL. In addition, we systematically identified genes whose expression was associated with TEL/AML1, BCR/ABL, or MLL abnormalities in both clinical samples and cell lines. Although some of these genes have previously been described, many have not previously been reported to be associated with one of these chromosomal abnormalities.

Current thinking holds that BCR-ABL forms a multi-protein complex that incorporates several substrates and adaptor proteins and is stabilized by multiple direct and indirect interactions. Signaling output from this highly redundant network leads to cellular transformation. Proteins known to be associated with BCR-ABL in this complex include: GRB2, c-CBL, p62(DOK), and CRKL. These proteins in turn, link BCR-ABL to various signaling pathways indicated in cellular transformation. In this study we show that a triple mutant of BCR-ABL with mutations of the direct binding sites for GRB2, CBL, p62(DOK) and CRKL, is defective for transformation of primary hematopoietic cells in vitro and in a murine CML model, while it retains the capacity to induce IL-3 independence in 32D cells. Compared to BCR-ABL, the triple mutant's ability to activate the MAP kinase and PI3-kinase pathways is severely compromised, while STAT5 phosphorylation is maintained, suggesting that the former are crucial for the transformation of primary cells, but dispensable for transformation of factor dependent cell lines. Our data suggest that inhibition of BCR-ABL-induced leukemia by disrupting protein interactions could be possible, but would require blocking of multiple sites.",

Dasatinib was well tolerated, with no observed toxicities exclusive to Asian patients. A higher incidence of adverse events and lower rate of response observed among Asian patients with myeloid blast phase CML reflected the aggressive nature of the disease. Analyses of noncompartmental pharmacokinetics (5 Asian and 49 non-Asian patients) and population pharmacokinetics (17 Asian and 382 non-Asian patients) were also comparable.

Since there is limited information on the distribution of clinico-biological variables in different age cohorts, we analyzed 5202 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in the Italian multicenter AIEOP and GIMEMA protocols and stratified them in nine age cohorts. The highest prevalence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia was observed in children, although a second peak was recorded from the 4(th) decade onwards. Interestingly, the lowest incidence was found in females between 14-40 years. Immunophenotypic characterization showed a B-lineage in 85.8% of patients: a pro-B stage, associated with MLL/AF4 positivity, was more frequent in patients between 10-50 years. T-lineage leukemia (14.2%) was rare among small children and increased in patients aged 10-40 years. The prevalence of the BCR/ABL1 rearrangement increased progressively with age starting from the cohort of patients 10-14 years old and was present in 52.7% of cases in the 6th decade. Similarly, the MLL/AF4 rearrangement constantly increased up to the 5(th) decade, while the ETV6/RUNX1 rearrangement disappeared from the age of 30 onwards. This study shows that acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adolescents and young adults is characterized by a male prevalence, higher percentage of T-lineage cases, an increase of poor prognostic molecular markers with aging compared to cases in children, and conclusively quantified the progressive increase of BCR/ABL(+) cases with age, which are potentially manageable by targeted therapies.

The bcr-abl gene complex behaves as a somatic dominant in CML, and we suggest that its acquired homozygosity is a mechanism of bcr-abl amplification similar to duplication of the Ph chromosome commonly found in the blast crisis of CML.",

In the current study, we analyzed the antileukemic activity of three available small molecules targeting CDK4/CDK6 against lymphoid crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-LC) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL), and found that all three molecules showed specific activities against leukemic cell lines derived from CML-LC and Ph(+) ALL. In particular, PD0332991 exhibited extremely high antileukemic activity against CML-LC and Ph(+) ALL cell lines in the nanomolar range by the induction of G0-G1 arrest and partially cell death through dephosphorylation of pRb and downregulation of the genes that are involved in S-phase transition. As an underlying mechanism for favorable sensitivity to the small molecules targeting CDK4/CDK6, cell-cycle progression of Ph(+) lymphoid leukemia cells was regulated by transcriptional and posttranscriptional modulation of CDK4 as well as Cyclin D2 gene expression under the control of BCR-ABL probably through the PI3K pathway. Consistently, the gene expression level of Cyclin D2 in Ph(+) lymphoid leukemia cells was significantly higher than that in Ph(-) lymphoid leukemia cells. Of note, three Ph(+) ALL cell lines having the T315I mutation also showed sensitivity to PD0332991. In a xenograft model, PD0332991, but not imatinib, suppressed dissemination of Ph(+) ALL having the T315I mutation and prolonged survival, demonstrating that this reagent would be a new therapeutic modality for relapsed CML-LC and Ph(+) ALL patients after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

Translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22 (known as the Philadelphia chromosome) results in a fusion BCR-ABL gene that produces a dysregulated BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase protein and triggers events leading to malignant transformation. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib block the BCR-ABL protein and prevent activation of the transformation pathways. Molecular monitoring, the most sensitive approach currently available to assess treatment response, measures BCR-ABL messenger RNA levels and serves as a surrogate marker of disease. Further, molecular responses are predictive of patient outcomes. It is important for advanced practitioners to become familiar with the technology and interpretation of molecular monitoring results as well as efforts to standardize this type of testing so they can educate their patients and aid their understanding of test results. Undetectable BCR-ABL levels can bring feelings of relief, whereas an increasing level can lead to anxiety. Advanced practitioners, therefore, are an important resource for interpreting results for patients, answering questions, alleviating concerns, and encouraging continued adherence to treatment. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Effective inhibition of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity with Imatinib represents a breakthrough in the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, more than 30 % of patients with CML in chronic phase do not respond adequately to Imatinib and the drug seems not to affect the quiescent pool of BCR-ABL positive leukemic stem and progenitor cells. Therefore, despite encouraging clinical results, Imatinib can still not be considered a curative treatment option in CML. We recently reported downregulation of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) in Imatinib treated K562 cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of eIF5A by siRNA in combination with Imatinib has been shown to exert synergistic cytotoxic effects on BCR-ABL positive cell lines. Based on the structure of known deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) inhibitors such as CNI-1493, a drug design approach was applied to develop potential compounds targeting DHS. Here we report the biological evaluation of selected novel (DHSI-15) as compared to established (CNI-1493, deoxyspergualin) DHS inhibitors. We show that upon the compounds tested, DHSI-15 and deoxyspergualin exert strongest antiproliferative effects on BCR-ABL cells including Imatinib resistant mutants. However, this effect did not seem to be restricted to BCR-ABL positive cell lines or primary cells. Both compounds are able to induce apoptosis/necrosis during long term incubation of BCR-ABL positive BA/F3 derivates. Pharmacological synergism can be observed for deoxyspergualin and Imatinib, but not for DHSI-15 and Imatinib. Finally we show that deoxyspergualin is able to inhibit proliferation of CD34+ progenitor cells from CML patients. We conclude that inhibition of deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) can be supportive for the anti-proliferative treatment of leukemia and merits further investigation including other cancers.",

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were applied to stratify our samples based on given gene lists reported to predict MLL, BCR-ABL, and T-ALL, as well as MLL and non-MLL gene rearrangement positive pediatric ALL. In addition, seven other B-precursor ALL cases not bearing t(9;22) or t(11q23)/MLL chromosomal aberrations were analyzed. Using top differentially expressed genes, hierarchical cluster and principal component analyses demonstrate that the genetically more heterogeneous B-precursor ALL samples intercalate with BCR-ABL-positive cases, but were clearly distinct from T-ALL and MLL profiles. Similar expression signatures were observed for both heterogeneous B-precursor ALL and for BCR-ABL-positive cases. As an unrelated laboratory, we demonstrate that gene signatures defined for childhood ALL were also capable of stratifying distinct subtypes in our cohort of adult ALL patients.

Cells were maintained without any cytokines for over 1 year, and named NT-1. This cell line was extensively characterized using morphological assays, flow cytometry, cytogenetic analysis, clonogenic culture, quantitative fluorescent PCR, short tandem repeating sequence PCR (STR-PCR) and array-CGH. Its tumorigenic capacity was also examined in nude mice. The NT-1 cell line had morphological features of chronic myeloid leukemia and major myeloid markers (CD13, CD33, CD11b). Additionally, NT-1 expressed progenitor cells and natural killer cell-related antigens such as CD34, CD117, CD56.

NT-1 cells maintained the same morphology, immunophenotyping and cytogenetic features as primary leukemia cells, which was strongly supported by STR-PCR results.

As a rule patients on therapy with imatinib achieve permanent complete cytogenetic and molecular remission. Patients who are primarily refractive to imatinib or lose remission achieved using imatinib are in the minority. This group has a poor prognosis. This article gives a transparent review of the diagnostics necessary when CML is primarily diagnosed and for assessment of the response during the course of the therapy. The guidelines developed for this procedure by the European leukemia network on the type and frequency of surveillance controls as well as the diagnostic criteria for imatinib resistance or suboptimal response will be presented. The indications for allogenic stem cell transplantation and the administration of second generation BCR-ABL inhibitors will be discussed as therapeutic alternatives in cases of imatinib failure in a stage-specific manner. Finally a view on therapy targets and forms of future first-line therapy of CML will be given.",

One patient with atypical CML had erythroid hematologic improvement. Both patients with polycythemia vera needed fewer phlebotomies (from 2-3 per year to none during the 8 months of therapy and from 3-6 per year to 1 during 9 months of therapy). None of the three patients with CMML responded. Treatment was well tolerated. The side effects were similar to those observed in patients with CML.;Within these small subgroups of disease types, single-agent imatinib did not achieve a significant clinical response among patients with AML, MDS, atypical CML, or CMML without PDGF-R fusion genes.

Although beta-catenin can be tyrosine (Y)-phosphorylated, the occurrence and biological relevance of this covalent modification in Bcr-Abl-associated leukemogenesis is unknown. Here we show that Bcr-Abl levels control the degree of beta-catenin protein stabilization by affecting its Y/S/T-phospho content in CML cells. Bcr-Abl physically interacts with beta-catenin, and its oncogenic tyrosine kinase activity is required to phosphorylate beta-catenin at Y86 and Y654 residues. This Y-phospho beta-catenin binds to the TCF4 transcription factor, thus representing a transcriptionally active pool. Imatinib, a Bcr-Abl antagonist, impairs the beta-catenin/TCF-related transcription causing a rapid cytosolic retention of Y-unphosphorylated beta-catenin, which presents an increased binding affinity for the Axin/GSK3beta complex. Although Bcr-Abl does not affect GSK3beta autophosphorylation, it prevents, through its effect on beta-catenin Y phosphorylation, Axin/GSK3beta binding to beta-catenin and its subsequent S/T phosphorylation. Silencing of beta-catenin by small interfering RNA inhibited proliferation and clonogenicity of Bcr-Abl(+) CML cells, in synergism with Imatinib. These findings indicate the Bcr-Abl triggered Y phosphorylation of beta-catenin as a new mechanism responsible for its protein stabilization and nuclear signalling activation in CML.",

A screen for Bcr-Abl mutants emerging in the presence of SGX393 revealed concentration-dependent reduction in the number and range of mutations. Combining SGX393 with nilotinib or dasatinib preempted emergence of resistant subclones, including Bcr-Abl(T315I).

We studied the molecular subtype of the Ph1 chromosome in 11 cases of Ph1-positive ALL, including 2 with a previous diagnosis of CML, using a sensitive method to analyze the mRNA species based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We observed unexpected heterogeneity in BCR-ABL mRNA in this population; in particular, 1 of 6 bcr-rearranged cases and 1 of 5 bcr-unrearranged cases contained none of the known fusion mRNA species, while 1 of the bcr-rearranged cases contained both. This latter case is particularly interesting because it suggests that the acquisition of an additional BCR-ABL fusion species may be a mechanism of disease progression.

All clinical studies and case reports published at the time of the search were included in this review.;Observed mutations in the amino acid sequence of BCR-ABL cause the failure of treatment with existing TK inhibitors.

Preliminary results are available from several noncomparative studies of dasatinib in patients who were unable to tolerate or were resistant to previous therapies. The 5 phases of START (SRC/ABL Tyrosine kinase inhibition Activity Research Trials of dasatinib) represent the largest and most comprehensive evaluation of dasatinib in the treatment of patients in all stages of CML or Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL who had undergone previous treatment for leukemia. Dasatanib had the greatest benefit in patients in the chronic phase of CML, with complete hematologic responses in 90% of patients, 52% of whom achieved a major hematologic response. Compared with those in the chronic phase, patients in the accelerated phase or blast crisis of CML, or with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL had lower responses. In the START-R trial, which compared the response to dasatinib and high-dose imatinib (800 mg/d), both regimens had comparable ability to induce a complete hematologic response (95% and 93%, respectively), although more patients achieved a major cytogenetic response with dasatinib (32% vs 7%). Adverse effects include significant myelosuppression. Dasatinib may have the potential for use in the management of nonleukemic malignancies.;Dasatinib has a wider spectrum of activity against a broader range of BCR-ABL forms than existing TK inhibitors. It has shown clinical benefit and tolerability in patients in all phases of CML, as well as in those with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. Dasatinib illustrates the potential for targeted drug development based on an understanding of the genetic alterations leading to CML and the development of resistance to treatment.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate WT1 expression and its clinical implication in childhood acute leukemia (AL) in Chinese population. Bone marrow specimen from 200 children at different stages of acute leukemia and from 21 children without leukemia were studied. The WT1 expression at diagnostic marrow specimen in both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) was higher than control group, whereas WT1 expression in AML was higher than in ALL, and WT1 expression level in relapse in ALL increased more significantly than in AML. The WT1 expression level showed positive correlation with the hypodiploidy and BCR-ABL fusion gene in acute leukemia. A rapidly decrease of WT1 expression level predicted a good response to the induction therapy and low expression of WT1 correlates with remission status.

Internal tandem duplications (ITD) of the juxtamembrane domain lead to the constitutive activation of the FLT3 kinase inducing the activation of multiple genes, which may result in the expression of leukemia-associated antigens (LAAs). We analyzed the regulation of LAA in FLT3-wild-type (WT)- and FLT3-ITD(+) myeloid cells to identify potential targets for antigen-specific immunotherapy for AML patients. Antigens, such as PR-3, RHAMM, Survivin, WT-1 and PRAME, were upregulated by constitutively active FLT3-ITD as well as FLT3-WT activated by FLT3 ligand (FL). Cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) clones against PR-3, RHAMM, Survivin and an AML-directed CTL clone recognized AML cell lines and primary AML blasts expressing FLT3-ITD, as well as FLT3-WT(+) myeloid dendritic cells in the presence of FL. Downregulation of FLT3 led to the abolishment of CTL recognition. Comparing our findings concerning LAA upregulation by the FLT3 kinase with those already made for the Bcr-Abl kinase, we found analogies in the LAA expression pattern.

To explore the possibility that recombinase-activating gene (RAG) activity might be involved in ALL, we performed extra-chromosomal recombination assays for cases with breakpoints close to potential cryptic recombination signal sequence (cRSS) sites. Of 13 ALL cases tested, 1/10 with p190 and 1/3 with p210 precisely recapitulated the forward BCR-ABL breakpoint and 1/10 with p190 precisely recapitulated the reciprocal breakpoint.

IM resistance often results from a secondary mutation in BCR-ABL that interferes with drug binding. However, in many instances, there is no mutation in BCR-ABL, and the basis of such BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance remains to be elucidated. To gain insight into BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance mechanisms, we performed a large-scale RNA interference screen and identified IM-sensitizing genes (IMSGs) whose knockdown renders BCR-ABL(+) cells IM-resistant. In these IMSG knockdown cells, RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling is sustained after IM treatment because of up-regulation of PRKCH, which encodes the protein kinase C (PKC) family member PKCη, an activator of CRAF. PRKCH is also up-regulated in samples from CML patients with BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance. Combined treatment with IM and trametinib, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved MEK inhibitor, synergistically kills BCR-ABL(+) IMSG knockdown cells and prolongs survival in mouse models of BCR-ABL-independent IM-resistant CML. Finally, we showed that CML stem cells contain high levels of PRKCH, and this contributes to their intrinsic IM resistance. Combined treatment with IM and trametinib synergistically kills CML stem cells with negligible effect on normal hematopoietic stem cells. Collectively, our results identify a therapeutically targetable mechanism of BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance in CML and CML stem cells. ",

They include dose escalation of imatinib, combination of imatinib with chemotherapeutic drugs, alternative Bcr-Abl inhibitors, inhibitors of kinases downstream of Bcr-Abl, farnesyl and geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors, histone deacetylase, proteasome and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, arsenic trioxide, hypomethylating agents, troxacitabine, targeting Bcr-Abl messenger RNA, and immunomodulatory strategies.

Here we report a novel BCR (breakpoint cluster region)-ABL (c-abl oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase)/GATA1/microRNA-138 (miR-138) circuitry in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). miR-138 expression is downregulated in K562 cells and primary CML samples, which is restored after imatinib treatment. The tumor suppressor activity of miR-138 is demonstrated by the induction of cell cycle arrest at G0/G1, inhibition of cell proliferation and colony forming unit granulocyte-macrophage colony formation and enhanced imatinib-induced apoptosis in K562 and Ku812 cells overexpressing miR-138. Moreover, overexpression of miR-138 led to the downregulation of BCR-ABL. Based on luciferase assay, ABL and BCR-ABL are shown to be the target genes regulated by miR-138. Furthermore, miR-138 binding to ABL was shown to localize to the coding region instead of 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR) of ABL mRNA. In addition, CCND3 is another target of miR-138, which represses CCND3 expression by binding to its 3'-UTR. Finally, upregulation of miR-138 upon imatinib treatment is associated with the enhancement of GATA1 activity, which binds to the miR-138 promoter. In conclusion, miR-138 is a tumor suppressor miRNA underexpressed in CML. miR-138 represses expression of both BCR-ABL and CCND3 via binding to the coding region and 3'-UTR, respectively. miR-138 expression is activated by GATA1, which in turn is repressed by BCR-ABL. Therefore, miR-138, by virtue of a BCR-ABL/GATA1/miR-138 circuitry, is a tumor suppressor miRNA implicated in the pathogenesis of CML and its clinical response to imatinib. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Recent reports have shown that upon expression of appropriate oncogenes, both stem cells and more differentiated progenitor populations can serve as leukemia-initiating cells. These studies suggest that oncogenic mutations subvert normal development and induce reacquisition of stem-like features. However, no study has described how specific mutations influence the ability of differentiating cell subsets to serve as leukemia-initiating cells and if varying such cellular origins confers a functional difference. We have examined the role of the tumor suppressor gene p19(ARF) in a murine model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and found that loss of p19(ARF) changes the spectrum of cells capable of tumor initiation. With intact p19(ARF), only hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can be directly transformed by BCR/ABL expression. In a p19(ARF)-null genetic background expression of the BCR/ABL fusion protein renders functionally defined HSCs, common lymphoid progenitors (CLP), and precursor B-lymphocytes competent to generate leukemia stem cells. Furthermore, we show that leukemias arising from p19(ARF)-null HSC versus pro-B cells differ biologically, including relative response to drug insult. Our observations elucidate a unique mechanism by which heterogeneity arises in tumor populations harboring identical genetic lesions and show that activity of p19(ARF) profoundly influences the nature of tumor-initiating cells during BCR/ABL-mediated leukemogenesis.",

The i(17q) hence plays a presumably important pathogenetic role both in leukemia development and progression. This notwithstanding, the molecular consequences of this abnormality have not been investigated in detail. We have analyzed 21 hematologic malignancies (8 CML in blast crisis, 8 myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS], 2 acute myeloid leukemias, 2 chronic lymphocytic leukemias, and 1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia) with i(17q) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Using a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig, derived from the short arm of chromosome 17, all cases were shown to have a breakpoint in 17p. In 12 cases, the breaks occurred within the Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS) common deletion region in 17p11, a gene-rich region which is genetically unstable. In 10 of these 12 cases, we were able to further map the breakpoints to specific markers localized within a single YAC clone. Six other cases showed breakpoints located proximally to the SMS common deletion region, but still within 17p11, and yet another case had a breakpoint distal to this region. Furthermore, using chromosome 17 centromere-specific probes, it could be shown that the majority of the i(17q) chromosomes (11 of 15 investigated cases) were dicentric, ie, they contained two centromeres, strongly suggesting that i(17q) is formed through an intrachromosomal recombination event, and also implicating that the i(17q), in a formal sense, should be designated idic(17)(p11). Because i(17q) formation results in loss of 17p material, potentially uncovering the effect of a tumor suppressor on the remaining 17p, the occurrence of TP53 mutations was studied in 17 cases by sequencing the entire coding region. In 16 cases, no TP53 mutations were found, whereas one MDS displayed a homozygous deletion of TP53. Thus, our data suggest that there is no association between i(17q) and coding TP53 mutations, and that another tumor suppressor gene(s), located in proximity of the SMS common deletion region, or in a more distal location, is of pathogenetic importance in i(17q)-associated leukemia.",

In the present study, the effect of  Morpholino Oligo Antisense in BCR/ABL oncogene silencing was evaluated.

Following western blotting, we found that complete silencing of BCR-ABL had been achieved but flow cytometric analysis showed no significant apoptosis.

The expression levels of miR-23a and BCR/ABL were assessed in 42 newly diagnosed CML patients, 37 CML patients in first complete remission and 25 healthy controls. Quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analysis and colony formation assay were used to evaluate changes induced by overexpression or inhibition of miR-23a or BCR/ABL. MiR-23a mimic or negative control mimic was transfected into a CML cell line (K562) and two lung cancer cell lines (H157 and SKMES1) using Lipofectamine 2000, and the cells were used for real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis. We found that the downregulation of miR-23a expression was a frequent event in both leukemia cell lines and primary leukemic cells from patients with de novo CML. The microarray results showed that most of the CML patients expressed high levels of BCR/ABL and low levels of miR-23a. Real-time RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that the BCR/ABL levels in miR-23a-transfected cells were lower than those in the control groups. Ectopic expression of miR-23a in K562 cells led to cellular senescence. Moreover, when K562 cells were treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA methylation inhibitor, BCR/ABL expression was upregulated, which indicates epigenetic silencing of miR-23a in leukemic cells. BCR/ABL and miR-23a expressions were inversely related to CML, and BCR/ABL expression was regulated by miR-23a in leukemic cells. The epigenetic silencing of miR-23a led to derepression of BCR/ABL expression, and consequently contributes to CML development and progression. ",

Recently, the LIM and SH3 domain protein 1 (LASP1) was identified as a component of a six gene signature that is strongly predictive for disease progression and relapse in CML patients. However, the underlying mechanisms why LASP1 expression correlates with dismal outcome remained unresolved. Here, we identified LASP1 as a novel and overexpressed direct substrate of BCR-ABL in CML. We demonstrate that LASP1 is specifically phosphorylated by BCR-ABL at tyrosine-171 in CML patients, which is abolished by tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Further studies revealed that LASP1 phosphorylation results in an association with CRKL - another specific BCR-ABL substrate and bona fide biomarker for BCR-ABL activity. pLASP1-Y171 binds to non-phosphorylated CRKL at its SH2 domain. Accordingly, the BCR-ABL-mediated pathophysiological hyper-phosphorylation of LASP1 in CML disrupts normal regulation of CRKL and LASP1, which likely has implications on downstream BCR-ABL signaling. Collectively, our results suggest that LASP1 phosphorylation might serve as an additional candidate biomarker for assessment of BCR-ABL activity and provide a first step toward a molecular understanding of LASP1 function in CML.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is caused by Bcr-Abl, an activated tyrosine kinase. The amounts of Bcr-Abl mRNA and protein in cells from patients in blast crisis (BC) are higher than in those chronic phase (CP), indicating that their expression rises with disease progression. In order to study this phenomenon on cells with the same genetic background, we transfected the 32D cell line with the BCR-ABL transgene and selected clones with graded expression of Bcr-Abl within the range found in cells from CP to BC. In vitro, we found that Bcr-Abl exerted dose-dependent effects upon growth factor dependence, clonogenicity and migration. However, the relationship between Bcr-Abl expression and cellular adhesion to fibronectin was more complex: rather than a direct positive correlation, clones that expressed low, but not high, levels of Bcr-Abl were less adhesive than growth factor stimulated, parental BCR-ABL-negative 32D cells. This finding parallels the situation with normal and CML-CP progenitors where the latter exhibit defective adhesion to fibronectin. Treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate reversed the adhesion deficient phenotype of clones expressing low levels of Bcr-Abl. When injected subcutaneously into syngeneic mice, cell lines expressing high levels of Bcr-Abl rapidly induced tumors, whereas low-expressing clones led to tumor formation only after a prolonged latency. These findings suggest that the level of Bcr-Abl may be essential in determining the phenotype of the leukemic clone at different stages of the disease.",

To conclude, the frequency of BCR/ABL translocation in Chinese patients with de novo ALL is comparable to patients in the Western hemisphere, in contrast to a previous report. The predominance of m-BCR/ABL fusion among these Chinese patients with BCR/ABL translocation is also similar to patients in the Western population.

We sought to investigate if other changes in the BCR-ABL kinase domain should be considered as single nucleotide polymorphisms rather than acquired mutations. A total of 911 chronic myeloid leukemia patients after failure or suboptimal response to imatinib were screened for BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis was based on the search for nucleotide changes in corresponding normal, non-translocated ABL alleles by ABL allele-specific PCR following mutation analysis. In addition to the K247R polymorphism we uncovered five new single nucleotide polymorphisms within the BCR-ABL kinase domain; two of them led to amino acid changes. Single nucleotide polymorphisms could theoretically contribute to primary but not to secondary resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and must therefore be distinguished from acquired mutations.

A second generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors was developed, which displays increased potency towards Bcr-Abl and is able to target the majority of CML mutant clones.

CD40 stimulation also caused ERK-dependent reduction of Bim-EL protein, but ERK inhibition did not prevent drug resistance. Drugs combined with sublethal doses of the BH3-mimetic ABT-737 displayed partial and variable effects per individual CD40-stimulated CLL. The antiapoptotic profile of CD40-triggered CLL resembled BCR-Abl-dependent changes seen in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which prompted application of c-Abl inhibitors imatinib or dasatinib. Both compounds, but especially dasatinib, prevented the entire antiapoptotic CD40 program in CLL cells, and restored drug sensitivity. These effects also occurred in CLL samples with dysfunctional p53. Importantly, ex vivo CLL LN samples also displayed strong ERK activation together with high Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 but low Bim levels.

However, although many patients respond well to standard-dose imatinib initially, some patients do not achieve adequate levels of response or discontinue therapy because of resistance. One approach to improving treatment response with first-line imatinib may be to increase the imatinib dose (800 mg/day), although recent trial data indicate that overall increases in response rates may be modest. Newer Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors can induce responses in patients with all phases of imatinib-resistant CML, even those with imatinib-resistant mutations in the BCR-ABL gene. Furthermore, in initial studies, first-line dasatinib or nilotinib treatment has produced response rates that compare favorably with historical controls treated with imatinib, although confirmation is required from head-to-head clinical trials.

Originally identified as transcriptional regulators of the type I interferon system, IRFs play a pivotal role in adaptive immunity, cell growth, differentiation and tumorigenesis. Hence, understanding IRF biology has important implications in the host response to cancer development and progression. Many lines of evidence suggest that different IRFs are involved in the pathogenesis of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), a myeloproliferative disorder caused by the BCR-ABL oncoprotein. BCR-ABL displays constitutive tyrosine kinase activity that favors cell proliferation, inhibits apoptosis and allows cell survival even in the absence of proper adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Different BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently available for CML treatment. These drugs are able to generate eight year CML-specific overall survival rates >90%, only a minority of patients will achieve molecular responses compatible with drug discontinuation. Thus, there is an unmet need for additional therapeutic targets that may lead to the cure of most patients diagnosed with CML. A growing body of evidence has suggested a role for both IRF4 and IRF8 in the pathogenesis of CML. Furthermore, IRF1 is consistently deleted at one or both alleles in patients with leukemia and myelodysplasia. Finally, we have recently demonstrated that IRF5 is a target of BCR-ABL kinase activity and reduces CML cell proliferation.

The expectation was that the vast majority of these patients would exhibit a complete cytogenetic response on imatinib alone. Studies of patients with acquired imatinib resistance revealed that Bcr-Abl signaling is reactivated at the time of resistance, predominantly because of mutations that interfere with drug binding in the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl. The knowledge that Bcr-Abl remains the optimal target for treating imatinib-refractory CML has driven an already highly successful search for alternative approaches to restore target inhibition. Here, we review the current state of affairs in the realm of controlling drug resistance in CML, including cutting-edge strategies to reign in Bcr-AblT315I, which is cross resistant to imatinib, as well as the \"next generation\" Bcr-Abl inhibitors, nilotinib and dasatinib. We also critically assess the role of combined Abl kinase inhibitor therapy in overcoming resistance and provide recommendations for monitoring patients for kinase domain mutations.",

Exploiting the selective affinity of Achatinin-H toward N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid-alpha2-6-GalNAc, we have demonstrated the presence of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins (Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs) on lymphoblasts of 70 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and on leukemic cell lines by fluorimetric HPLC and flow cytometric analysis. This study aims to assess the structural aspect of the glycotope of Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs(ALL) and to evaluate whether these disease-specific molecules can be used to monitor the clinical outcome of ALL. The Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs(ALL) were affinity-purified, and three distinct leukemia-specific molecular determinants (135, 120, and 90 kDa) were demonstrated by SDS-PAGE, western blotting, and isoelectric focusing. The carbohydrate epitope of Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs(ALL) was confirmed by using synthetic sialic acid analogs. The enhanced presence of anti-Neu5,9Ac(2)-GP(ALL) antibody in ALL patients prompted us to develop an antigen-ELISA using purified Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs(ALL) as coating antigens. Purified antigen was able to detect leukemia-specific antibodies at presentation of disease, which gradually decreased with treatment. Longitudinal monitoring of 18 patients revealed that in the early phase of the treatment patients with lower anti-Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs showed a better prognosis. Minimal cross-reactivity was observed in other hematological disorders (n = 50) like chronic myeloid leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as normal healthy individuals (n = 21). This study demonstrated the potential of purified Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs(ALL) as an alternate tool for detection of anti-Neu5,9Ac(2)-GP antibodies to be helpful for diagnosis and monitoring of childhood ALL patients.",

FLT3 is therefore an attractive drug target. However, the molecular mechanisms by which FLT3 mutations lead to cell transformation in AML remain unclear. To develop a better understanding of FLT3 signaling as well as its downstream effectors, we performed detailed phosphoproteomic analysis of FLT3 signaling in human leukemia cells. We identified over 1000 tyrosine phosphorylation sites from about 750 proteins in both AML (wild type and mutant FLT3) and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (normal and amplification of FLT3) cell lines. Furthermore, using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), we were able to quantified over 400 phosphorylation sites (pTyr, pSer, and pThr) that were responsive to FLT3 inhibition in FLT3 driven human leukemia cell lines. We also extended this phosphoproteomic analysis on bone marrow from primary AML patient samples, and identify over 200 tyrosine and 800 serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in vivo. This study showed that oncogenic FLT3 regulates proteins involving diverse cellular processes and affects multiple signaling pathways in human leukemia that we previously appreciated, such as Fc epsilon RI-mediated signaling, BCR, and CD40 signaling pathways.

ARG is a widely expressed tyrosine kinase that shares substantial sequence identity with c-ABL in the kinase domain and cooperates with ABL to regulate neurulation in the developing mouse embryo. As described here, ARG has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of leukemia as a fusion partner of TEL. A TEL/ARG fusion was constructed to determine whether ARG can be inhibited by STI571. When expressed in the factor-dependent murine hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3, the TEL/ARG protein was heavily phosphorylated on tyrosine, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins, and induced factor-independent proliferation. The effects of STI571 on Ba/F3 cells transformed with BCR/ABL, TEL/ABL, TEL/PDGFbetaR, or TEL/ARG were then compared. STI571 inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation and cell growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR/ABL, TEL/ABL, TEL/PDGFbetaR, and TEL/ARG with an IC(50) of approximately 0.5 microM in each case, but it had no effect on untransformed Ba/F3 cells growing in IL-3 or on Ba/F3 cells transformed by TEL/JAK2. Culture of TEL/ARG-transfected Ba/F3 cells with IL-3 completely prevented STI571-induced apoptosis in these cells, similar to what has been observed with BCR/ABL- or TEL/ABL-transformed cells.

Further studies were performed using a competitive PCR titration assay and the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method to monitor the leukemic clone. Progression of the disease was associated with a higher BCR-ABL transcript level and an increasing proportion of BCR-ABL-positive cells. Metaphase FISH analysis identified the presence of the BCR-ABL fusion gene on a normal chromosome 22. This study shows that a late-appearing Ph translocation in ALL may be cytogenetically invisible.

We have developed an experimental system in which murine hematopoietic stem cell populations are infected with either v-abl or BCR/ABL retroviruses and are used to reconstitute lethally irradiated mice. Irrespective of the form of activated abl, greater than 90% of the animals reconstituted with such cells develop tumors.

The myeloproliferative syndrome is characterized by large numbers of clonally derived, infected myeloid cells. This model will allow study of the mechanism by which activated abl genes affect hematopoietic precursors in chronic myelogenous leukemia.

The Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) expresses an alternative form of c-Abl, v-Abl, that transforms murine pro-B cells, resulting in acute leukemia and providing an experimental model for human disease. Gleevec (STI571) inhibits the Abl kinase and has shown great utility against CML and ALL in humans, although its usefulness is limited by acquired resistance. Since STI571 is active against A-MuLV-transformed cells in vitro, we performed a retroviral cDNA library screen for genes that confer resistance to apoptosis induced by STI571. We found that forced expression of Cdk6 promotes continued cell division and decreased apoptosis of leukemic cells. We then determined that the transcription factor E2A negatively regulates Cdk6 transcription in leukemic pro-B cells and that the v-Abl kinase stimulates Cdk6 expression via an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1-dependent pathway. Finally, we show that the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor PD0332991 can act synergistically with STI571 to enhance leukemic cell death, suggesting a potential role for CDK6 inhibitors in the treatment of STI571-resistant CML or ALL.",

Although imatinib therapy was continued, a second MBC was diagnosed, 13 months after RTC. Chemotherapy, using mainly VCR+PSL was performed and imatinib was discontinued. RTC was achieved, and Ph chromosomes and BCR/ABL again disappeared. One year later, a 3rd MBC developed, and chemotherapy using Ara-C+DNR was performed. A 3rd RTC was achieved, and BCR/ABL decreased. This CML case was resistant to imatinib, but chemotherapy was effective in all 3 episodes of MBC, and BCR/ABL decreased or disappeared.",

This latter stage can exhibit either myeloid or lymphoid blast clones. Our recent results have demonstrated the presence of the P210 BCR-ABL protein in blood cells from benign phase CML patients (Guo et al., Cancer Research 51:3048, 1991). This protein is the product of an 8.5 kb chimeric RNA encoded by fused BCR-ABL genes produced by the formation of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. Using this new assay we have identified a patient with benign-phase CML who produces P190 BCR-ABL, the form of the BCR-ABL protein found in about 50% of cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). This patient lacked detectable P210 BCR-ABL protein and did not contain a DNA rearrangement in the major breakpoint cluster region of the BCR gene. Consistent with this result, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses detected a BCR-ABL mRNA with BCR exon 1 fused to ABL exon 2. No BCR-ABL mRNAs with 2'- or 3'-bcr exon to ABL exon 2 fusions were detected in these analyses. Blood cells from this patient lost P190 BCR-ABL after the patient underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, but regained this protein although the patient was still in chronic phase after a subsequent autologous transplant as treatment for graft failure. These findings indicate that P190 BCR-ABL alone is not sufficient to induce a blast crisis phenotype in leukemia patients who are Ph chromosome-positive.",

No alteration in the organization of v-abl-homologous sequences was detected in the genomic DNA of the Ph'-positive CML patient. Karyotypic analysis of the Burkitt-type B-lymphoblastic leukemia patient revealed the presence of an 8,14 translocation together with a number of other chromosomal aberrations. However, no abnormality of chromosome 9 could be detected. Hence, the observed increase in c-abl transcription is not consistently associated with either gross gene rearrangement or presence of the Ph'.

The most sensitive method of detecting BCR-ABL aberration is RT-PCR which is able to find a single in leukemic cell between 10(6) normal leukocytes. Monitoring of BCR-ABL transcript level by quantitative RT-PCR is of the high prognostic value. High or increasing BCR-ABL transcript number signalizes bad response to treatment and a bad prognosis. On the contrary RT-PCR negativity, low level, or decreasing BCR-ABL transcript number denotes good response to treatment and good prognosis. Q-RT-PCR can detect changes in disease status several weeks or even months earlier than other methods. In 1994 the Q-RT-PCR was introduced at the Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion in Prague and was used for early detection of relapse after transplantation.

        "Doc_abstract":"The targeting of BCR-ABL, a hybrid oncogenic tyrosine (Y) kinase, does not eradicate chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-initiating cells. Activation of β-catenin was linked to CML leukemogenesis and drug resistance through its BCR-ABL-dependent Y phosphorylation and impaired binding to GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β). Herein, we show that GSK3β is constitutively Y(216) phospho-activated and predominantly relocated to the cytoplasm in primary CML stem/progenitor cells compared with its balanced active/inactive levels and cytosolic/nuclear distribution in normal cells. Under cytokine support, persistent GSK3β activity and its altered subcellular localization were correlated with BCR-ABL-dependent and -independent activation of MAPK and p60-SRC/GSK3β complex formation. Specifically, GSK3β activity and nuclear import were increased by imatinib mesylate (IM), a selective ABL inhibitor, but prevented by dasatinib that targets both BCR-ABL- and cytokine-dependent MAPK/p60-SRC activity. SB216763, a specific GSK3 inhibitor, promoted an almost complete suppression of primary CML stem/progenitor cells when combined with IM, but not dasatinib, while sparing bcr-abl-negative cells. Our data indicate that GSK3 inhibition acts to prime a pro-differentiative/apoptotic transcription program in the nucleus of IM-treated CML cells by affecting the β-catenin, cyclinD1, C-EBPα, ATF5, mTOR, and p27 levels. In conclusion, our data gain new insight in CML biology, indicating that GSK3 inhibitors may be of therapeutic value in selectively targeting leukemia-initiating cells in combination with IM but not dasatinib.",

IM was discontinued after treatment for 47 months in November 2005. At the same time, BCR-ABL transcript was undetectable by nested RT-PCR assay, which was equivalent to <0.00138% BCR-ABL according to the international scale. The patient is still under observation with no additional therapy, and BCR-ABL has remained negative for 102 months, to date. Furthermore, interferon was never used in this patient. IM has dramatically improved the prognosis of CML. Since no cure has yet been established, patients are recommended to continue treatment even after achieving deep molecular responses. There are several ongoing clinical trials challenging the discontinuation of IM, but long-term observation is still lacking.

The pathogenesis of CML involves the constitutive activation of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, which governs malignant disease by activating multiple signal transduction pathways. The BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor, imatinib, is the front-line treatment for CML, but the emergence of imatinib resistance and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has called attention for additional resistance mechanisms and has led to the search for alternative drug treatments. In this paper, we discuss our current understanding of mechanisms, related or unrelated to BCR-ABL, which have been shown to account for chemoresistance and treatment failure. We focus on the potential role of the influx and efflux transporters, the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, and transcription factor-mediated signals as feasible molecular targets to overcome the development of TKIs resistance in CML.",

This disease can present myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic characteristics. According to the classification established by the World Health Organization, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is inserted in a group of myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorders; its diagnosis requires the presence of persistent monocytosis and dysplasia involving one or more myeloid cell lineages. Furthermore, there should be an absence of the Philadelphia chromosome and the BCR/ABL fusion gene and less than 20% blasts in the blood or bone marrow. Phenotypically, the cells in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia can present myelomonocytic antigens, such as CD33 and CD13, overexpressions of CD56 and CD2 and variable expressions of HLA-DR, CD36, CD14, CD15, CD68 and CD64. The increase in the CD34 expression may be associated with a transformation into acute leukemia. Cytogenetic alterations are frequent in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and molecular mutations such as NRAS have been identified. The present article reports on a case of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, diagnosed by morphologic and phenotypical findings that, despite having been suggestive of acute monocytic leukemia, were differentiated through a detailed analysis of cell morphology.

The patient showed a progressive cognitive decline as the main symptom. MRI revealed a hydrocephalus and an increase in cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with around 50% immature blasts in the differential count. A highly elevated BCR-ABL/ ABL ratio was detected in the CSF, whilst the ratio for peripheral blood and bone marrow was not altered. On treatment of the malresorptive hydrocephalus with shunt surgery, the patient showed an initial cognitive improvement, followed by a secondary deterioration. At this time, the cranial MRI showed leukemic infiltration of lateral ventricles walls. Hence, intrathecal administration of cytarabine, methotrexate, and dexamethasone was initiated, which caused a significant decrease of cells in the CSF. Soon after, the patient demonstrated significant cognitive improvement with a good participation in daily activities. At a later time point, after the patient had lost the major molecular response of CML, therapy with dasatinib was initiated. In a further follow-up, the patient was neurologically and hematologically stable.;In patients with treated CML, the rare case of an isolated CNS blast crisis has to be taken into account if neurological symptoms evolve.

Molecular characterization of these changes, in particular chromosomal translocations, has yielded a wealth of information on the mechanisms of leukemogenesis. These findings have also allowed the development of sensitive assays for the identification of underlying molecular defects, which is applicable to disease diagnosis and to monitor response to treatment. Genetic alterations in childhood leukemia are powerful prognostic indicators. TEL-AML1 fusion and hyperdiploidy >50 chromosomes are associated with a good prognosis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, whereas BCR-ABL fusion and MLL rearrangements are associated with a poor prognosis. Hence cytogenetic and molecular genetic classification of childhood leukemia will significantly improve the ability of clinicians to predict therapeutic response and prognosis, which paves the way for risk stratification based on clinical and genetic features. Finally, deciphering of genetic lesions in leukemia has allowed elucidation of the molecular basis of current treatment, as typified by the success of all-trans retinoic treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia, and has identified targets for novel therapeutic approaches. It is envisaged that efforts in characterization of molecular defects in childhood leukemia will ultimately be translated into better clinical outcome for patients.",

We studied the changes induced by Akti-1/2 and A-443654 at the mRNA level by performing reverse transcriptase multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. We also studied the changes induced by both Akt inhibitors in some BCL-2 protein family members on chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by western blotting. Moreover, we analyzed the cytotoxic effect of Akt inhibitors in patients' cells with deleted/mutated TP53.;Both inhibitors induced apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were more sensitive to Akt inhibitors than T cells from leukemic patients, and B or T cells from healthy donors. Survival factors for chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, such as interleukin-4 and stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha, were not able to block the apoptosis induced by either Akt inhibitor. Akti-1/2 did not induce any change in the mRNA expression profile of genes involved in apoptosis, while A-443654 induced some changes, including an increase in NOXA and PUMA mRNA levels, suggesting the existence of additional targets for A-443654. Both inhibitors induced an increase in PUMA and NOXA protein levels, and a decrease in MCL-1 protein level.

Therefore, Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase is a rational therapeutic target in all phases of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Although imatinib mesylate (STI571, Gleevec, Novartis, Basal, Switzerland) produces high rates of complete clinical and cytogenetic responses in the chronic phase, resistance is universal and clinical relapse develops rapidly in the advanced phases of chronic myelogenous leukemia. This resistance has been shown to be caused by specific ATP binding site mutations or amplification of Bcr-Abl gene, resulting in a Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase that is resistant to further inhibition by imatinib. Alternative (Bcr-Abl-independent) mechanisms driving the growth and survival of the malignant clone may also be responsible for imatinib resistance. Novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors that also target Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, or agents that downregulate Bcr-Abl levels regardless of its wild-type or mutant status, may need to be developed clinically for the future therapy of imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia.",

We have directly compared the tyrosine kinase activity, in vitro transformation properties, and in vivo leukemogenic activity of the P190, P210, and P230 forms of BCR/ABL. P230 exhibited lower intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity than P210 and P190. Although all three oncogenes transformed both myeloid (32D cl3) and lymphoid (Ba/F3) interleukin (IL)-3-dependent cell lines to become independent of IL-3 for survival and growth, their ability to stimulate proliferation of Ba/F3 lymphoid cells differed and correlated directly with tyrosine kinase activity. In a murine bone marrow transduction/transplantation model, the three forms of BCR/ABL were equally potent in the induction of a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-like myeloproliferative syndrome in recipient mice when 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-treated donors were used. Analysis of proviral integration showed the CML-like disease to be polyclonal and to involve multiple myeloid and B lymphoid lineages, implicating a primitive multipotential target cell. Secondary transplantation revealed that only certain minor clones gave rise to day 12 spleen colonies and induced disease in secondary recipients, suggesting heterogeneity among the target cell population. In contrast, when marrow from non- 5-FU-treated donors was used, a mixture of CML-like disease, B lymphoid acute leukemia, and macrophage tumors was observed in recipients. P190 BCR/ABL induced lymphoid leukemia with shorter latency than P210 or P230. The lymphoid leukemias and macrophage tumors had provirus integration patterns that were oligo- or monoclonal and limited to the tumor cells, suggesting a lineage-restricted target cell with a requirement for additional events in addition to BCR/ABL transduction for full malignant transformation. These results do not support the hypothesis that P230 BCR/ABL induces a distinct and less aggressive form of CML in humans, and suggest that the rarity of P190 BCR/ABL in human CML may reflect infrequent BCR intron 1 breakpoints during the genesis of the Ph chromosome in stem cells, rather than intrinsic differences in myeloid leukemogenicity between P190 and P210.",

While it is known that BCR-ABL initiates the disease and that secondary molecular and genetic abnormalities likely contribute to progression of the disease to blast crisis, details regarding the mechanism(s) of blast phase progression are lacking. Two recent reports identify Musashi 2 (Msi2) as a key regulator in the progression of CML from the chronic phase to blast crisis. These reports demonstrated that the cell fate determination protein, Numb, was downregulated in blast crisis CML and that exogenous expression of Numb inhibited leukemogenesis. Correspondingly, Msi2 was shown to be upregulated in blast crisis CML and to negatively regulate expression of Numb. Exogenous expression of Msi2 enhanced the formation of an aggressive immature leukemia induced by BCR-ABL. High expression of Msi2 was also found in leukemic cells of AML patients and elevated Msi2 expression was shown to associate with poor prognosis in both AML and CML. These reports together highlight the apparent role of the Musashi-Numb pathway in regulating the formation of aggressive myeloid leukemia, and thus provide a potential molecular mechanism for the transition of chronic phase CML to the deadly blast crisis. Importantly, this work suggests this pathway may provide targets for future therapies that are desperately needed for aggressive forms of myeloid leukemia.",

Preclinical data indicate that dasatinib is 325-fold more potent than imatinib against cells expressing wild-type Bcr-Abl, and that dasatinib is active against 18 of 19 Bcr-Abl mutations known to cause imatinib resistance. Phase I clinical data show that dasatinib is well tolerated and highly effective for the treatment of imatinib-resistant/imatinib-intolerant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the molecular mechanism of action of dasatinib is not fully understood. In this study, we confirm that dasatinib inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of SFKs, including Src, Hck, and Lyn, in K562 human CML cells. Significantly, downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5) signaling is also blocked by dasatinib as shown by decreases in levels of phosphorylated Stat5 and Stat5 DNA-binding activities. In addition, dasatinib down-regulates expression of Stat5 target genes, including Bcl-x, Mcl-1, and cyclin D1. Consistent with these results, blockade of Stat5 signaling by dasatinib is accompanied by inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Surprisingly, Stat5 DNA-binding activities are enhanced with increasing cell density, which is associated with resistance to apoptosis by dasatinib. Our findings indicate that inhibition of Stat5 signaling downstream of Bcr-Abl/SFKs contributes to the action of dasatinib, and, conversely, that increasing cell density up-regulates Stat5 activation and confers resistance to dasatinib. Moreover, the level of phosphorylated Stat5 in CML cells represents a mechanistically relevant biomarker for monitoring inhibition of Bcr-Abl signaling by dasatinib in CML patients using convenient immunocytochemical assays.",

The aim of this article was to investigate the possibility of combating the resistance to apoptosis caused by Bcr-Abl by inducing an alternative cell death process. As a model of chronic myeloid leukemia, we employed Bcr-Abl-transfected mouse progenitor 32D cells with low and high Bcr-Abl expression levels corresponding to drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells, respectively. The drug curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a known potent inducer of cell death in many cancer cells, was investigated for efficacy with Bcr-Abl-expressing cells. Curcumin strongly inhibited cell proliferation and affected cell viability by inducing apoptotic symptoms in all tested cells; however, apoptosis was a relatively late event. G(2)-M cell cycle arrest, together with increased mitotic index and cellular and nuclear morphology resembling those described for mitotic catastrophe, was observed and preceded caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Mitosis-arrested cells displayed abnormal chromatin organization, multipolar chromosome segregation, aberrant cytokinesis, and multinucleated cells-morphologic changes typical of mitotic catastrophe. We found that the mitotic cell death symptoms correlated with attenuated expression of survivin, a member of the chromosomal passenger complex, and mislocalization of Aurora B, the partner of survivin in the chromosomal passenger complex. Inhibition of survivin expression with small interfering RNA exhibited similar mitotic disturbances, thus implicating survivin as a major, albeit not the only, target for curcumin action. This study shows that curcumin can overcome the broad resistance to cell death caused by expression of Bcr-Abl and suggests that curcumin may be a promising agent for new combination regimens for drug-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia.",

The clear link between the Hedgehog pathway and BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia led to an effort to identify small molecules to block the pathway.;We investigated the combined effects of vismodegib and ponatinib, a pan-ABL1 kinase inhibitor, in nonobese diabetic/severe-combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) repopulating T315I BCR-ABL1-positive cells in vitro and in vivo.;We observed that combination with vismodegib and ponatinib helps to eliminate therapy-resistant NOD/SCID repopulating T315I BCR-ABL1-positive cells. The percentage of CD19-positive leukemia cells in peripheral blood was significantly lower in vismodegib + ponatinib-treated mice than that of the vehicle or ponatinib alone (P < 0.001). Spleen weights were also lower in vismodegib + ponatinib-treated mice than in ponatinib alone (P < 0.05). Overall tumor burden, as assessed by BCR-ABL mRNA from bone marrow cells, was significantly lower in vismodegib + ponatinib-treated mice than in ponatinib alone (P < 0.005). We also found that vismodegib significantly reduced BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia cell self-renewal in vitro as well as during serial transplantation in vivo.;The combination with a Smo inhibitor and ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors may help eliminate therapy-resistant T315I BCR-ABL1-positive leukemia cells.

To determine whether BCR-ABL kinases are inefficient in transforming T lymphocytes, BCR-ABL-expressing retroviruses were injected intrathymically into mice. Thymomas that expressed BCR-ABL kinase developed after a relatively long latent period. In most thymomas, deletion of 3' proviral sequences resulted in loss of tk-neo and occasionally caused expression of kinase-active carboxy-terminally truncated BCR-ABL oncoprotein. In contrast, deletion of 3' proviral sequences was not observed in thymomas induced with Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV). BCR-ABL viruses induced distinct patterns of disease and involved different thymocyte subsets than A-MuLV and Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV). While Mo-MuLV only induced Thy-1+ thymomas, v-abl- and BCR-ABL-induced thymomas often contained mixed populations of B220+ and Thy-1+ lymphocytes in the same tumor. In most v-abl and BCR-ABL tumors, Thy-1+ lymphoid cells expressed CD8 and a continuum of CD4 ranging from negative to positive. Conversely, Mo-MuLV thymomas contained distinct populations of CD4+ cells that were either CD8+ or CD8-. A-MuLV-transformed T-lymphoid cells did not express the CD3/T-cell receptor complex, while BCR-ABL tumors were CD3+. Thus, BCR-ABL viruses preferentially induce somewhat more differentiated T lymphocytes than are transformed by A-MuLV. Furthermore, rare B220+ lymphocytes may represent preferred v-abl and BCR-ABL transformation targets in the thymus.",

Amplification of ABL is an exceedingly rare event, with only less than 5 cases reported in the literature. The p16(INK4a) (or CDKN2A) gene on 9p21 is a tumor suppressor gene, and deletion thereof is recently recognized as one of the most common genetic abnormalities in ALL. The authors herein describe an 8-year-old male patient with precursor T-cell ALL harboring both ABL gene amplification and p16(INK4a) gene deletion. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using BCR/ABL probes revealed five or more ABL signals, indicating amplification in 51.5% of interphase nuclei. FISH using p16(INK4a) gene probes showed heterozygous p16(INK4a) deletion in 71.0%. On conventional cytogenetic analysis, however, only 10 metaphases were available, which showed the normal karyotype, 46,XY[10], serving no evidence for the findings on FISH. This is the first report of an ALL case with ABL amplification, and the authors speculate that both ABL proto-oncogene amplification and the p16(INK4a) tumor suppressor gene deletion have been implicated in leukemogenesis in the present case, although whether the ABL amplification truly contributes to the leukemogenesis or merely an epiphenomenon representing underlying genomic instability remains to be determined.",

The results indicated that levels of bcr-abl mRNA before transplantation were high (median 29.303%) and decreased greatly (median 0) at the first month after allo-SCT. During the first year after allo-SCT, the patterns of serial bcr-abl transcripts varied in number, but the overall bcr-abl transcript levels significantly decreased at 6 months after allo-SCT. Majority of patients with undetectable or very low levels of bcr-abl mRNA were monitored after 1 year following transplantation. The hematological features of BM and PB in all detected patients remained normal. PB and BM bcr-abl values were not different significantly and had the similar trend of changes. It is concluded that the bcr-abl mRNA levels in CML patients change greatly early after allograft. Serial monitoring measurements for bcr-abl mRNA contribute to understanding the trend of change and effect of transplantation, also can be a guidance for starting therapy. But detectable levels of bcr-abl mRNA during the first 6 months do not indicate relapse. Measurements of bcr-abl mRNA of PB may be more suitable for routine monitoring long-term disease status in CML after allo-HSCT.",

The concept was introduced in 1978 to model bone marrow sites suited to host hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and favor their self-renewal, while restraining clonal expansion and commitment to differentiation. Studies of the effects of low oxygen tension on HSC maintenance in vitro led us to hypothesize niches were located within bone marrow areas where oxygen tension is lower than elsewhere. We named these areas hypoxic stem cell niches, although a low oxygen tension is to be considered physiological for the environment where HSCs are maintained. HSCs were later shown to have the option of cycling in low oxygen, which steers this cycling to the maintenance of stem cell potential. Cell subsets capable of withstanding incubation in very low oxygen were also detected within leukemia cell populations, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The oncogenetic Bcr/Abl protein is completely suppressed in these subsets, whereas Bcr/Abl messenger ribonucleic acid is not, indicating that CML cells resistant to low oxygen are independent of Bcr/Abl for persistence in culture but remain genetically leukemic. Accordingly, leukemia stem cells of CML selected in low oxygen are refractory to the Bcr/Abl inhibitor imatinib mesylate. Bcr/Abl protein suppression turned out to be actually determined when glucose shortage complicated the effects of low oxygen, indicating that ischemia-like conditions are the driving force of leukemia stem cell refractoriness to imatinib mesylate. These studies pointed to \"ischemic\" stem cell niches as a novel scenario for the maintenance of minimal residual disease of CML. A possible functional relationship of the \"ischemic\" with the \"hypoxic\" stem cell niche is discussed.",

Valproic acid (VPA) is an anti-epileptic drug that also acts as a class I histone deacetylase inhibitor. The aim of this research was to determine the anti-leukemic effects of dasatinib and VPA in combination and to identify their mechanism of action in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Dasatinib was found to exert potent synergistic inhibitory effects on VPA-treated AML cells in association with G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction involving the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-3, -7 and -9. Dasatinib/VPA-induced cell death thus occurred via caspase-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK inhibitors efficiently inhibited dasatinib/VPA-induced apoptosis. The combined effect of dasatinib and VPA on the differentiation capacity of AML cells was more powerful than the effect of each drug alone, being sufficiently strong to promote AML cell death through G1 cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. MEK/ERK and p38 MAPK were found to control dasatinib/VPA-induced apoptosis as upstream regulators, and co-treatment with dasatinib and VPA to contribute to AML cell death through the regulation of differentiation capacity. Taken together, these results indicate that combined dasatinib and VPA treatment has a potential role in anti-leukemic therapy. ",

Previously, we showed an abundance of inactive GSK-3 in the human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line. CML is a hematopoietic malignancy caused by an oncogenic Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. In Bcr-Abl signaling, the role of GSK-3 is not well defined. Here, we report that enforced expression of constitutively active GSK-3 reduced proliferation and increased Bcr-Abl inhibition-induced apoptosis by nearly 1-fold. Bcr-Abl inhibition activated GSK-3 and GSK-3-dependent apoptosis. Inactivation of GSK-3 by Bcr-Abl activity is, therefore, confirmed. To reactivate GSK-3, we used glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitor PDMP to accumulate endogenous ceramide, a tumor-suppressor sphingolipid and a potent GSK-3 activator. We found that either PDMP or silence of GCS increased Bcr-Abl inhibition-induced GSK-3 activation and apoptosis. Furthermore, PDMP sensitized the most clinical problematic drug-resistant CML T315I mutant to Bcr-Abl inhibitor GNF-2-, imatinib-, or nilotinib-induced apoptosis by >5-fold. Combining PDMP and GNF-2 eliminated transplanted-CML-T315I-mutants in vivo and dose dependently sensitized primary cells from CML T315I patients to GNF-2-induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis.

Due to its excellent hematologic and cytogenetic responses, particularly in patients with chronic phase CML, imatinib has moved towards first-line treatment for newly diagnosed CML. Nevertheless, resistance to the drug has been frequently reported and is attributed to the fact that transformation of hematopoietic stem cells by BCR-ABL is associated with genomic instability. Point mutations within the ABL tyrosine kinase of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein are the major cause of resistance, though overexpression of the BCR-ABL protein and novel acquired cytogenetic aberrations have also been reported. A variety of strategies derived from structural studies of the ABL-imatinib complex have been developed, resulting in the design of novel ABL inhibitors, including AMN107, BMS-354825, ON012380 and others. The major goal of these efforts is to create new drugs that are more potent than imatinib and/or more effective against imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL clones. Some of these drugs have already been successfully tested in preclinical studies where they show promising results. Additional approaches are geared towards targeting the expression or stability of the BCR-ABL kinase itself or targeting signaling pathways that are chronically activated and required for transformation. In this review, we will discuss the underlying mechanisms of resistance to imatinib and novel targeted approaches to overcome imatinib resistance in CML.",

Molecular cytogenetic analysis confirmed that formation of an ETV6/ABL1 fusion in these patients required at least three chromosomal breaks and showed that each of these translocations is the result of a complex chromosomal rearrangement. Molecular analysis showed the presence of two fusion transcripts in both patients as the result of alternative splicing, questioning the suggested role of these transcripts in the lineage specificity.

In addition to age and performance status of patients, an established panel of cytogenetic and molecular markers allows an individual risk stratification for selecting the most appropriate therapeutic procedure for each patient. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) younger patients with genetically determined intermediate and poor risk status benefit from allogeneic stem cell transplantation whereas patients in the low risk group are still primarily treated with conventional induction chemotherapy with anthracycline and cytarabine. The poor prognosis of elderly patients with AML has been improved by the development of stem cell transplantation procedures with reduced intensity conditioning and for patients not suitable for stem cell transplantation, the introduction of less toxic demethylating substances allows a substantial improvement in outcome and quality of life compared to cytoreductive therapy alone. The additional role of targeted therapies in AML is still under investigation. In adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the standard systemic therapy still consists of complex cytotoxic regimens which have been modified from pediatric protocols. Biologically and genetically determined subgroups of ALL patients as well as poor responders, who can be identified by the detection of significant molecular determined residual disease (MRD) after standard therapy, benefit from allogeneic transplantation in first remission. In patients with bcr-abl positive ALL, the implementation of first and second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors has led to rapidly rising response rates and less toxicity. Patients with relapsed ALL may benefit from new molecular options, e.g. bispecific antibodies. Additionally, improved standardization and supportive care, particularly due to the introduction of modern antimycotic agents, increase the treatment options and improve the prognosis of patients with acute leukemia.;The improved diagnostic and therapeutic options for patients with acute leukemia require a complex management. Currently only subgroups of patients benefit from molecular targeted therapeutic strategies.

Cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP) is a newly designed transduction peptide that carries molecules across the cell membrane with a preference to localize in the cytoplasmic compartment and is, therefore, applicable for cytoplasmic targeting. The Bcr-Abl fusion protein, playing major causative role in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), is a cytoplasmic oncoprotein that contains an N-terminus oligomerization domain (OD) mediating homodimerization of Bcr-Abl proteins, and an intact OD in Bcr-Abl is required both for the activation of its transforming activity and tyrosine kinase. Therefore, disrupting Bcr-Abl oligomerization represents a potential therapeutic strategy for inhibiting Bcr-Abl oncogenicity. In this study, we explored the possible homodimerization-disrupting and tyrosine kinase inhibiting effect of the transduction of OD in Bcr-Abl positive K562 cells. By expressing in Escherichia coli a CTP-OD-HA fusion protein followed by Ni+-NTA affinity purification, immunoblot identification and enterokinase cleavage, we showed that the CTP-OD-HA protein was structurally and functionally active in that it potently transduced and primarily localized into the cytoplasmic compartment, heterodimerized with Bcr-Abl, and potently inhibited the phospho-tyrosine pathways of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein at a low concentration of 4 microM. These results delineate strategies for the expression and purification of therapeutic molecules for intracytoplasmic protein based therapeutics and the CTP-OD-HA-mediated killing strategy could be explored as a promising anti-leukemia agent or an adjuvant to the conventional therapeutic modalities in chronic myeloid leukemia, such as in vitro purging.",

However, in a proportion of patients neither mechanism operates, and resistance appears to be a priori, existing prior to exposure to the drug. These mechanisms of imatinib resistance are poorly understood and may be heterogeneous.;We have previously described such innate resistance to imatinib in subclones of a myeloid leukemia cell line, KCL22, in which imatinib exposure inhibits the activity of Bcr-Abl and yet fails to induce apoptosis. We describe here whole-genome expression analysis of imatinib-sensitive and -resistant cells derived from the original KCL22 line, using Affymetrix microarray analysis.;We detected differential expression of 39 genes that correlate with the imatinib-resistant phenotype. The resistant cells overexpress several genes associated with the suppression of apoptosis or with conferral of a transformed phenotype.;Amongst the differentially-expressed genes correlating with imatinib resistance, several suggest the activation of alternative pathway(s) that maintain viability and growth independently of Bcr-Abl kinase activity.

We report on two patients with Ph+ ALL who were successfully treated with polychemotherapy and consecutive autologous HSCT. Both patients are in continuous hematologic remission after an observation period of 12 years and 18 years, respectively, despite measurable MRD and although no maintenance therapy was initiated. BCR/ABL transcript-levels ranged between 0.1 and 3% in patient 1, and 0.01 and 0.1% in patient 2 during the observation time. Collectively, these data suggest that not all Ph+ subclones even those that persist after HSCT in Ph+ ALL, may have the potential to cause a hematologic relapse.

In particular, while CML progenitor cells and differentiated cells are oncogene addicted, BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase is dispensable for CML LSC survival and maintenance. Notably, in CML, additional cellular mechanisms promote LSC survival and maintenance, rendering these cells able to survive even in the presence of TKI and to eventually promote relapse.;This review will focus on the mechanisms of LSC insensitivity to TKI and on the strategies to obtain synthetic lethality with combination therapies.;Several pathways have been proposed to promote LSC maintenance and described as ideal targets to induce CML LSC exhaustion in combination with TKI.

It is generated by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation, t(9;22) (q34;q11), and the enhanced kinase activity of the protein is believed to be implicated in the pathogenesis of the diseases. To examine its oncogenicity in vivo and to create an animal model for BCR/ABL-positive leukemias, we generated transgenic mice expressing p210bcr/abl driven by the promoter of the mouse tec gene, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase preferentially expressed in early hematopoietic progenitors. While the founder mice showed excessive proliferation of lymphoblasts shortly after birth and were diagnosed as ALL, the transgenic progeny reproducibly exhibited marked granulocyte hyperplasia with thrombocytosis after a long latent period, which closely resembles the clinical course of human CML. In addition, to investigate whether loss of p53 would play a role in the transition from chronic phase to blast crisis of CML, we crossmated p210bcr/abl transgenic (BCR/ABLtg/-) mice with p53 heterozygous (p53+/-) mice and generated p210bcr/abl transgenic, p53 heterozygous (BCR/ABLtg/- p53+/-) mice, in which a somatic alteration in the residual p53 allele directly abrogates p53 function.

        "Doc_abstract":"The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph-chromosome) has long represented the only cytogenetic abnormality known to be associated with a specific malignant disease in humans, being present in more than 95% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. This abnormality is the result of a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosome 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11), and its presence is not restricted to chronic myelogenous leukemia, but can also be found in 30% of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults. In the 1980s, the molecular counterpart of the chromosomal rearrangement was identified to consist of the juxtaposition of parts of the BCR and ABL genes to form a BCR-ABL hybrid gene. The resulting chimeric proteins (P210 and P190), which retain constitutively activated tyrosine kinase activity, have demonstrated a causative role in the genesis of the leukemic process. Although many aspects of the BCR-ABL driven transformation remain unsolved, great advances in understanding the molecular pathology of Ph-positive leukemias resulted in meaningful improvement in the clinical setting. Molecular tools to diagnose disease (PCR, FISH, and southern blot) and to monitor minimal residual disease after potential curative treatment are now in current practice, and new powerful therapeutic tools have emerged that target the molecular oncogenic pathways activated in Ph-positive cells. Among them, specific ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors recently obtained extraordinary results in many clinical protocols. This review summarizes the most recent advances in this field with special focus on the putative mechanisms of the transformation and progression of chronic myelogenous leukemia and on the major impact that understanding the molecular biology of these diseases is having in clinical practice.",

The fact that the majority of CML patients who respond very well but discontinue tyrosine kinase inhibitors later show evidence of molecular recurrence focuses attention on the need for further research on leukemic stem cells.

To identify such potential targets, we used lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) as a tool for functional genomics in cell lines as well as primary normal and CML CD34+ cells. In a conditional cell culture model, we demonstrate that RNAi-mediated reduction of SHP2, STAT5, and Gab2 protein expression inhibits BCR-ABL-dependent but not cytokine-dependent proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, colony formation of purified primary CML but not of normal CD34+ colony-forming cells is specifically reduced by inhibition of SHP2, STAT5, and Gab2 expression, respectively. In addition, coexpression of both anti-BCR-ABL and anti-SHP2 shRNAs from a single lentiviral vector induces stronger inhibition of colony formation as compared to either shRNA alone. The data indicate that BCR-ABL expression may affect the function of normal signaling molecules.

Individual patients were regarded as having achieved molecular relapse (MR) if the BCR-ABL/ABL ratio exceeded 0.02% on 3 occasions or reached 0.05% on 2 occasions.

Current research is now focusing on how to prevent relapse. Improvement of postremission therapy is indispensable. Although allogeneic HSCT during first complete remission is still the first choice for feasible patients, post-HSCT imatinib therapy and imatinib plus chemotherapy combinations should also be studied.

Profound eradication of leukemia cells not only provides patients with a better chance for receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation during first CR but also contributes to durable CR even without transplantation. Despite such improvement, however, relapse does occur, mainly owing to acquisition of resistance.

He achieved complete remission after the first course of induction therapy and underwent allogeneic PBSCT in August 2001. However, leukemic cells appeared in the peripheral blood demonstrating complex chromosomal abnormalities with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) and expressing minor BCR/ABL transcripts. We thus retrospectively examined the bone marrow sample at presentation with both interphase FISH and RT-PCR methods. Surprisingly, almost all leukemic blasts at presentation turned out to possess the minor type of BCR/ABL fusion gene. In spite of the second allogeneic PBSCT, the patient died of pneumonia and graft-versus-host disease in the liver in September 2002. This case is rare in that cytogenetic analysis failed to detect Ph1 due to leukemic cells dormancy. The application of both FISH and RT-PCR studies would appear to be essential to avoid overlooking Ph1-positive ALL.",

All CFU-GM colonies with analyzable metaphases were found to contain a Ph chromosome. In 2 patients, the initial PCR screening failed to detect BCR-ABL transcripts in 2 of 11 and 1 of 7 Ph-positive colonies. However, when amplification for BCR-ABL was repeated in quintuplicate, all but 1 colony from a single patient showed one or more positive results. Amplifications of the four genes in each colony showed that BCR-ABL, ABL-BCR, and the normal BCR and ABL were simultaneously expressed in the majority of CFU-GM colonies. Replicate PCR tests for BCR and for ABL in colonies initially scored as negative also uncovered previously undetected positive amplifications.

The prognostic significance of such additional chromosomal abnormalities has been controversial. Translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) CCND1-IGH is typically associated with mantle cell lymphoma or a subset of plasma cell myeloma and is exceedingly rare in myeloid neoplasm. Here we report a unique case describing a patient found at diagnosis of chronic phase CML to have both the Philadelphia chromosome as well as t(11;14)-a rare cytogenetic combination. The patient was treated with imatinib with appropriate hematologic response but persistent disease by FISH and RT-PCR. She was switched to dasatinib and eventually achieved cytogenetic remission in both translocations, but still with persistent RT-PCR evidence of BCR-ABL1 fusion. As cyclin D1 is a regulatory subunit of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 and is required for the cells to progress through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, overexpression of cyclin D1 will likely promote cells into cell cycle. This may further augment proliferation in addition to upregulated ABL1 kinase activity in the index case. It may also contribute to the resistance to imatinib, as imatinib only targets on BCR-ABL fusion.

There is compelling evidence that malignant transformation by BCR-ABL is critically dependent on its protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity. As a result, multiple signaling pathways are activated in a kinase-dependent manner, and thus the activation of such pathways may affect the expression of genes that confer the malignant phenotype. In this study, we used differential display to investigate the alterations of gene expression in BV173, a CML cell line derived from lymphoid blast crisis, after exposure to ST1571, which selectively inhibits ABL PTK activity. We show that the expression of a set of 12 genes is correlated with the kinase activity and that the profile of these genes reflects mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of CML. Several of the genes show a consistent pattern of altered regulation in all Ph-positive lymphoid cell lines, whereas others appear to be unique to BV173 cells. We conclude that BCR-ABL PTK activity drives the expression of specific target genes that contribute to the malignant transformation of Ph-positive cells.

Based on the pharmacophore modeling approaches, it is possible to decipher the molecular determinants to inhibit BCR-ABL. We conducted a structure based and ligand based study to identify potent natural compounds as BCR-ABL inhibitor. First kinase inhibitors were docked with the receptor (BCR-ABL) and nilotinib was selected as a pharmacophore due its high binding efficiency. Eleven compounds were selected out of 1457 substances which have mutual pharmacopohre features with nilotinib.

The introduction of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) specific for BCR-ABL, was a major breakthrough in CML therapy. Although most patients respond to first-line imatinib therapy, some experience a loss of response (resistance) or require treatment discontinuation due to toxicity (intolerance). For patients who fail with standard-dose imatinib therapy, imatinib dose escalation is a second-line option. However, high-dose imatinib is not an appropriate approach for patients experiencing drug toxicity, and there remain questions over the durability of responses achieved with this strategy. Alternative second-line options include the newer TKIs dasatinib and nilotinib. A substantial amount of long-term data for these agents is available. Although both are potent and specific BCR-ABL TKIs, dasatinib and nilotinib exhibit unique pharmacological profiles and response patterns relative to different patient characteristics, such as disease stage and BCR-ABL mutational status.

These encode different c-abl messenger RNAs (mRNAs), p210 and p190, respectively. It has been suggested that one class of Ph+ ALL (bcr+) may be a variant of CML arising in a multipotent stem cell, the other (bcr-) de novo ALL initiated in a lymphoid-committed progenitor. Thirty-two cases of ALL (12 Ph1+, ten chromosomally normal, and ten non-mitotic cases) were investigated for bcr involvement. Breakpoints were found within five Ph1+ and in one normal case. There was no difference in clinical features, common ALL antigen (CALLA) positivity, cytogenetics, or response to treatment between the 6 bcr+ and 7 Ph1+ bcr- patients. Myeloid antigen expression was found in 2 bcr+ cases. Bcr rearrangement appeared to be restricted to the lymphoblastic component of marrow or blood in at least four bcr+ cases. In one case, separated myeloid and lymphoid cell fractions were both bcr+. Potential heterogeneity of the Ph1+ target cell, as seen in this study, may be more important in determining disease outcome than the precise location of the Ph breakpoint.",

Despite the significant prolongation of overall survival of CML patients there is still room for improvement. Approximately 20-25% of patients initially treated with imatinib will need alternative therapy, due to drug resistance which is often caused by the appearance of clones expressing mutant forms of BCR-ABL. Second generation TKIs dasatinib and nilotinib have shown promising results in imatinibresistant or intolerant CML patients, but are not active against CML clones with highly resistant T315I mutation. In recent years special attention is placed on small pool of leukemic stem cells which may contribute to the persistence of the leukemia.

        "Doc_abstract":"Treatment options for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are discussed.;In the 1980s busulfan and hydroxyurea were the standards of care. These were subsequently replaced by interferon alpha (IFN alpha) based therapy. Currently, bone marrow transplant survival has improved, making this also a viable option. Five-year progression-free survival averaged above 70% for chemotherapeutic options. Transplant survival at 56 months was approximately 60%; however, these survivors were generally cured of disease. The recognition of the role for BCR-ABL in CML has led to the development of specific kinase inhibitors such as imatinib. Clinical trial evidence has demonstrated a clear superiority of imatinib over interferon plus cytarabine, making this the new standard of care in first-line treatment of CML. Resistance to imatinib has been observed, in addition to relapse. The data suggest that the probability of response may be estimated as early as six months after initiation of imatinib therapy. Although combinations of imatinib with IFN alpha show small improvements compared to imatinib therapy alone, the biggest improvements were seen when imatinib doses were doubled. Unfortunately, not all patients can tolerate this increase in dose. The most common mechanism for imatinib resistance is the presence of a mutated BCR-ABL kinase. Several of these mutants have been cloned and characterized.;Molecular-targeted BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib, are now first-line treatment for CML. Allogeneic stem cell transplant is still the only proven curable treatment for CML in patients with an appropriate donor. Next generation BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors hold promise for patients with mutated BCR-ABL kinase that confer resistance to imatinib.",

Although the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is highly effective in the treatment of CML, its continuous administration is associated with development of resistance, particularly in advanced phase or blast crisis. We investigate here whether a feature of disease progression (i.e., elevated expression of Bcr-Abl in CD34+ progenitor cells from CML patients in blast crisis) has any bearing on the kinetics of resistance to imatinib. By studying cell lines that exogenously express Bcr-Abl over the range found from chronic phase to blast crisis of CML, we show that cells expressing high amounts of Bcr-Abl, as in blast crisis, are much less sensitive to imatinib and, more significantly, take a substantially shorter time for yielding a mutant subclone resistant to the inhibitor than cells with low expression levels, as in chronic phase. Our data suggest that the differential levels of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein expressed by CD34+ CML cells may reflect the extent and duration of their response to imatinib; the relatively high levels of oncoprotein in advanced-phase disease may underlie the observed rapid development of resistance.",

The encapsulation yields and drug loading of each molecule was evaluated. Anti-leukemia activity of the developed formulations co-encapsulating siRNA and imatinib and of the combination of Trf-liposomes carrying siRNA and free imatinib under two different treatment schedules of pre-sensitization was assessed. The results obtained demonstrate that the presence of imatinib significantly decreases the encapsulation yields of siRNA, whereas imatinib encapsulation yields are increased by the presence of siRNA. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrate that the formulations co-encapsulating siRNA and imatinib promote a 3.84-fold reduction on the imatinib IC(50) (from 3.49 to 0.91 µM), whereas a 8.71-fold reduction was observed for the pre-sensitization protocols (from 42.7 to 4.9 nM). It was also observed that the formulations with higher siRNA to imatinib molar ratios promote higher cell toxicity.

CML progresses through a series of three defined stages with survival times of 3-5 years if untreated. The chromosomal translocation creating the Ph chromosome creates the BCR-ABL fusion protein, which is the initiating factor for CML. BCR-ABL is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, which transforms hematopoietic stem cells through dysregulation of proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and cell adhesion. The transformation process is then accelerated by the accumulation of additional translocations. This fusion protein has been used clinically as a therapeutic target and a sensitive marker for measuring residual disease. Techniques, such as cytogenetic analysis of chromosomes, allow for the visualization of the Ph chromosome and additional translocations and abnormalities. The more sensitive fluorescent in situ hybridization assay can directly visualize the bcr-abl translocation through merged fluorescent tags. Polymerase chain reaction, the most sensitive of the assays, can be used to detect minute amounts of bcr-abl mRNA and this has made it possible to monitor and detect minimal residual disease recurrence and disease progression, thus greatly enhancing patient care.;A variety of monitoring techniques can be employed during CML therapy, providing degrees of quantifying disease burden or absence of disease.",

Cancer cells efficiently use limited energy sources, and drugs targeting cellular metabolism improve the efficacy of therapy. In this study, we characterized the effects of novel anti-cancer fatty-acid derivative AIC-47 and imatinib, focusing on cancer-specific energy metabolism in chronic myeloid leukemia cells. AIC-47 and imatinib in combination exhibited a significant synergic cytotoxicity. Imatinib inhibited only the phosphorylation of BCR-ABL; whereas AIC-47 suppressed the expression of the protein itself. Both AIC-47 and imatinib modulated the expression of pyruvate kinase M (PKM) isoforms from PKM2 to PKM1 through the down-regulation of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1). PTBP1 functions as alternative splicing repressor of PKM1, resulting in expression of PKM2, which is an inactive form of pyruvate kinase for the last step of glycolysis. Although inactivation of BCR-ABL by imatinib strongly suppressed glycolysis, compensatory fatty-acid oxidation (FAO) activation supported glucose-independent cell survival by up-regulating CPT1C, the rate-limiting FAO enzyme. In contrast, AIC-47 inhibited the expression of CPT1C and directly fatty-acid metabolism. These findings were also observed in the CD34(+) fraction of Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. These results suggest that AIC-47 in combination with imatinib strengthened the attack on cancer energy metabolism, in terms of both glycolysis and compensatory activation of FAO. ",

To develop a new strategy for the treatment of CML, we investigated the associations among bcr-abl, the cascade related to cancer energy metabolism, and autophagy induced by a fatty-acid derivative that we had previously reported as being an autophagy inducer. Here we report that a fatty-acid derivative, AIC-47, induced transcriptional repression of the bcr-abl gene and modulated the expression profile of PKM isoforms, resulting in autophagic cell death. We show that c-Myc functioned as a transcriptional activator of bcr-abl, and regulated the hnRNP/PKM cascade. AIC-47, acting through the PPARγ/β-catenin pathway, induced down-regulation of c-Myc, leading to the disruption of the bcr-abl/mTOR/hnRNP signaling pathway, and switching of the expression of PKM2 to PKM1. This switching caused autophagic cell death through an increase in the ROS level. Our findings suggest that AIC-47 induced autophagic cell death through the PPARγ/β-catenin/bcr-abl/mTOR/hnRNP/PKM cascade. ",

Responses improve with time and complete cytogenetic and major molecular levels reach 87 and 70% respectively at 5 years. However, despite these remarkable improvements, new problems arise as sub-optimal responses, imatinib-resistances with recently identified BCR-ABL protein point mutations, responsible for a variety of therapeutic consequences : imatinib dose increase, alternative treatments with second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs : dastinib, nilotinib) or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The treatment of accelerated and blastic phases relies on imatinib +/- conventional chemotherapy, ideally followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation, as newly developed TKIs are currently evaluated within this frame. Finally, BCR-ABL(T315I) mutations remain a new therapeutic critical challenge as none of the three TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib) can efficiently control such diseases.",

Eight achieved a complete karyotypic remission before mobilization obtained with discontinuation of alpha-INF for few days and G-CSF at a dosage of 15 microg/kg/day for 5-7 consecutive days. By quantitative-competitive polymerase chain reaction (QC-PCR) assay, all the leukaphereses and bone marrow samples during post mobilization follow up were studied to determine the amount of bcr-abl transcript. Karyotypic and molecular analysis on evaluable leukapheresis showed that all the harvests were Ph negative and bcr-abl positive: in seven cases the levels of bcr-abl transcript were higher or equal to the pre-apheresis status. In three out of four patients, who underwent more than one leukapheresis procedure, we noticed a decreasing amount of bcr-abl contamination from the first to the last apheresis.

In P210 bcr/abl, the bcr portion includes a coiled-coil oligomerization domain (amino acids 1-63) and a grb2-binding site at tyrosine 177 (Tyr177) that are critical for fibroblast transformation, but give variable results in other cell lines. To investigate the role of the coiled-coil domain and Tyr177 in promoting CML, 4 P210 bcr/abl-derived mutants containing different bcr domains fused to abl were constructed. All 4 mutants, Delta(1-63) bcr/abl, (1-63) bcr/abl, Tyr177Phe bcr/abl, and (1-210) bcr/abl exhibited elevated tyrosine kinase activity and conferred factor-independent growth in cell lines. In contrast, differences in the transforming potential of the 4 mutants occurred in our mouse model, in which all mice receiving P210 bcr/abl-expressing bone marrow cells exclusively develop a myeloproliferative disease (MPD) resembling human CML. Of the 4 mutants assayed, only 1-210 bcr/abl, containing both the coiled-coil domain and Tyr177, induced MPD. Unlike full-length P210, this mutant also caused a simultaneous B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The other 3 mutants, (1-63) bcr/abl, Tyr177Phe bcr/abl, and Delta(1-63) bcr/abl, failed to induce an MPD but instead caused T-cell ALL.

We have developed a quantitative real-time PCR (QC-PCR) method in the LightCycler, based on the use of fluorescently labeled probes (HybProbes), to estimate BCR-ABL fusion gene transcripts in samples from CML patients.;Fifty-two samples (45 peripheral blood, five bone marrow, and two apheresis product samples) from nine patients with CML were analyzed. Seven patients were studied at diagnosis and during follow-up after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), whereas two were evaluated only after HSCT. The PCR reaction was carried out in capillary tubes in a final volume of 10 microL, using 2 microL cDNA, the Mensik et al. primers, and two HybProbes. The results for BCR-ABL were normalized with reference to ABL. The PCR program is completed in only 45 min.;The sensitivity attained allowed the detection of rearrangements at dilutions of between 5-10(-4) and 10(-5) K562 cDNA. The within-assay coefficient of variation was 11% for BCR-ABL, and 9% for ABL. A greater than 2 log reduction in the BCR-ABL/ABL ratio was evident shortly after transplantation in all allografted patients.;We may conclude that the TaqMan probe technology can be easily adapted to HybProbes with equivalent results. Besides, the results of BCR-ABL quantification in the follow-up of patients clearly confirm that real-time PCR with HybProbes is a reliable and sensitive method for monitoring minimal residual leukemia after HSCT in CML patients.",

Preliminary studies have described a high incidence of childhood leukemia in these countries; however, no molecular analyses of these malignancies have yet been carried out. We studied diagnostic samples from 84 patients from the National Children's Hospital in San Jose, Costa Rica (65 precursor B-ALL, 5 T-cell ALL, and 14 acute myeloblastic leukemia). Our methodology included cytogenetic, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction approaches. The observed rate of leukemia was 52.2 cases per million children per year. Twelve out of 65 (18.4%) precursor B-ALL tested positive for TEL-AML1 and 3 cases for BCR-ABL (4.6%). In addition, we detected 2 patients carrying an E2A-PBX1 transcript (3.1%) and 1 patient with an MLL-AF4 fusion gene (1.5%). None of the T-cell ALL cases were positive for either SIL-TAL1 or HOX11L2. Within 14 acute myeloblastic leukemia patients, we confirmed 2 cases with FLT3-internal tandem duplication+, 1 patient with AML1-ETO, and only 1 case carrying a PML-RARalpha rearrangement.

Among recently reported BCR-ABL splice variants, exon 7 deletion (Δexon7) was characterized in this study. The frequency of Δexon7 was investigated in 30 healthy controls and in 76 CML patients at different time points of the disease course by four different molecular genetic methods (direct sequencing, fragment analysis, allele-specific and quantitative PCR). The functionality and viability of the variant protein was tested by bioinformatic prediction. The Δexon7 was abundantly detected with similar frequency in healthy controls, in imatinib naive and resistant CML patients on BCR-ABL and also on the nontranslocated ABL. The detection rate of Δexon7 (varying between 17 and 100%) was highly dependent on the expression levels of BCR-ABL or ABL and the sensitivity of detection method. According to secondary structure prediction by bioinformatic methods, the exon 7 deleted mRNA is a target for nonsense-mediated decay, and the translated protein is likely to be nonfunctional and unstable. Taken together all the above observations, we concluded that Δexon7 is a common splice variant not associating with imatinib resistance.",

The BCR-ABL(T315I) mutant is highly resistant to imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, and is frequently detected in relapsed patients. This critical gap in resistance coverage drove development of DCC-2036, an ABL inhibitor that binds the switch control pocket involved in conformational regulation of the kinase domain. We evaluated the efficacy of DCC-2036 against BCR-ABL(T315I) and other mutants in cellular and biochemical assays and conducted cell-based mutagenesis screens. DCC-2036 inhibited autophosphorylation of ABL and ABL(T315I) enzymes, and this activity was consistent with selective efficacy against Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL (IC(50): 19 nmol/L), BCR-ABL(T315I) (IC(50): 63 nmol/L), and most kinase domain mutants. Ex vivo exposure of CML cells from patients harboring BCR-ABL or BCR-ABL(T315I) to DCC-2036 revealed marked inhibition of colony formation and reduced phosphorylation of the direct BCR-ABL target CrkL. Cell-based mutagenesis screens identified a resistance profile for DCC-2036 centered around select P-loop mutations (G250E, Q252H, Y253H, E255K/V), although a concentration of 750 nmol/L DCC-2036 suppressed the emergence of all resistant clones. A decreased concentration of DCC-2036 (160 nmol/L) in dual combination with either nilotinib or dasatinib achieved the same zero outgrowth result. Further screens for resistance due to BCR-ABL compound mutations (two mutations in the same clone) identified BCR-ABL(E255V / T315I) as the most resistant mutant. Taken together, these findings support continued evaluation of DCC-2036 as an important new agent for treatment-refractory CML.",

Epidemiology, staging biology, and monitoring techniques are reviewed.;CML is a myeloproliferative disorder that affects all lineages of hematopoiesis. Final confirmation of CML comes with detection of the Philadelphia Chromosome (Ph) or BCR-ABL transcripts. The disease presents in one of three phases: chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast crisis. Progression from chronic phase to accelerated phase usually involves the accumulation of additional cytogenetic aberrations and the arising of resistance to therapy. Although at one point mortality associated with CML was high, new kinase inhibitor therapies have markedly extended the life-span of these patients. These inhibitors were derived through the initial observation of the association of the Ph with CML and the eventual identification of the BCR-ABL oncogene which arises from this translocation. Analysis of the mechanism by which BCR-ABL transforms cells identified this protein as a tyrosine kinase and led to the targeting of this activity. The majority of patients present in chronic phase, which is where these kinase inhibitors have their greatest efficacy. Monitoring of disease progression is of critical importance as the prognosis drops significantly for patients with advanced disease. Blood counts, cytogenetics, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are currently used to assess disease. Blood counts are inexpensive but lack sensitivity. Cytogenetic karyotyping while requiring specialized training provides evidence of clonal evolution. Quantitative PCR is capable of tremendous sensitivity making it well suited for assessing response to therapy and the early detection of therapy failures.;Our understanding of BCR-ABL has allowed the development of therapies, which may keep patients with CML in chronic phase indefinitely. This has created a situation in which patient monitoring is essential for detecting changes in the status of CML.

Treatment of CML by imatinib is effective to control the tyrosyl phosphorylation of the protein related to the cell signaling. BCR-ABL mRNA is overexpressed in the minimal residual disease (MRD), known as an early sign of relapse. Between December 2005 and June 2008, we measured BCR-ABL mRNA levels in the bone marrow (BM) from patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital.

These findings demonstrate the requirement for a functional BCR-ABL gene in maintaining the leukemic phenotype and the feasibility of gene-targeted selective killing of neoplastic cells.",

Despite the success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in CML treatment, TKI resistance, caused by mutations in Bcr-Abl or aberrant activity of its network partners, remains a clinical problem. Using inducible expression and knockdown systems, we analyzed the role of Gab2 in Bcr-Abl signaling in human CML cells, especially with respect to TKI sensitivity. We show for the first time that Gab2 signaling protects CML cells from various Bcr-Abl inhibitors (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib and GNF-2), whereas Gab2 knockdown or haploinsufficiency leads to increased TKI sensitivity. We dissected the underlying molecular mechanism using various Gab2 mutants and kinase inhibitors and identified the Shp2/Ras/ERK and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axes as the two critical signaling pathways. Gab2-mediated TKI resistance was associated with persistent phosphorylation of Gab2 Y452, a PI3K recruitment site, and consistent with this finding, the protective effect of Gab2 was completely abolished by the combination of dasatinib with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235. The identification of Gab2 as a novel modulator of TKI sensitivity in CML suggests that Gab2 could be exploited as a biomarker and therapeutic target in TKI-resistant disease.",

The hallmark of CML is an acquired chromosomal translocation known as the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) that results in the synthesis of the BCR-ABL fusion protein, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase (TK). The introduction of imatinib, a TK inhibitor (TKI) specific for BCR-ABL, was a major breakthrough in CML therapy. Although most patients respond to first-line imatinib therapy, some experience a loss of response (resistance) or require treatment discontinuation because of toxicity (intolerance). In patients for whom standard-dose imatinib therapy (400 mg/day) fails, imatinib dose escalation (600-800 mg/day) is a second-line option. However, high-dose imatinib is not an appropriate approach for patients experiencing drug toxicity, and there remain questions over the durability of responses achieved with this strategy. Alternative second-line options include the newer TKIs dasatinib and nilotinib. A substantial amount of long-term data for these agents is available. Although both are potent and specific BCR-ABL TKIs, dasatinib and nilotinib exhibit unique pharmacologic profiles and response patterns relative to different patient characteristics, such as disease stage and BCR-ABL mutational status. To optimize therapeutic benefit, clinicians should select treatment based on each patient's historical response, adverse event tolerance level, and risk factors.",

Other potential causes of thrombotic microangiopathy were discarded, and the predisposing role of some comorbidities and potential short or long-term drug-drug interactions was assessed. The clinical and biological data were more indicative of atypical secondary hemolytic uremic syndrome in one of the cases and of secondary thrombotic microangiopathy with renal and cardiac impairment in the other, which is also categorized as secondary hemolytic uremic syndrome.

The detection limit of the method, assessed using serial dilutions of ALL/MIK cells, was found to be 1:10(5), similar to what is observed for the conventional RT-nested PCR method. The e1a2 BCR-ABL values were normalized with respect to those of the housekeeping gene GAPDH. The decrease in the e1a2 BCR-ABL/GAPDH ratio after remission induction chemotherapy reflects well the response to chemotherapy and consequently correlates with the prognosis. Although molecular remission was achieved by chemotherapy alone, some patients relapsed, and the e1a2 BCR-ABL/GAPDH ratios in these cases progressively increased to the levels seen prior to hematological relapse. Long-term hematological complete remission (more than 30 months) could be achieved in cases in which a more than 4.0 log decrease in the e1a2 BCR-ABL/GAPDH ratio was obtained by chemotherapy alone, and BMT was then performed. In conclusion, real-time RT-PCR allows for an evaluation of the kinetics of e1a2 BCR-ABL/GAPDH expression during the various phases of chemotherapy or after BMT and may be effective for the indication and control of disease relapse in Ph-positive ALL patients.",

However, even though imatinib successfully controls the leukemia in chronic phase, it seems not to be able to cure the disease, potentially necessitating lifelong treatment with the inhibitor under constant risk of relapse. On a molecular level, the cause of disease persistence is not well understood. Initial studies implied that innate features of primitive progenitor cancer stem cells may be responsible for the phenomenon. Here, we describe an assay using retroviral insertional mutagenesis (RIM) to identify genes contributing to disease persistence in vivo. We transplanted mice with bone marrow cells retrovirally infected with the Bcr-Abl oncogene and subsequently treated the animals with imatinib to select for leukemic cells in which the proviral integration had affected genes modulating the imatinib response. Southern blot analysis demonstrated clonal outgrowth of cells carrying similar integration sites. Candidate genes located near the proviral insertion sites were identified, among them the transcription factor RUNX3. Proviral integration near the RUNX3 promoter induced RUNX3 expression, and Bcr-Abl-positive cell lines with stable or inducible expression of RUNX1 or RUNX3 were protected from imatinib-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, imatinib treatment selected for RUNX1-expressing cells in vitro and in vivo after infection of primary bone marrow cells with Bcr-Abl and RUNX1. Our results demonstrate the utility of RIM for probing molecular modulators of targeted therapies and suggest a role for members of the RUNX transcription factor family in disease persistence in CML patients.",

The results showed that persistent full donor chimerism (DC >/= 95%) was associated with an absence of MRD.

Such an effect could be of potential importance for telomere maintenance in Ph+ cells by facilitating clonal selection and progression of the disease to blast crisis.;We investigated the impact of imatinib on telomere length and telomerase activity of the interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine pro-B cell line BaF3 and the BCR-ABL-positive, IL-3-independent transfectant BaF3p185 in vitro.;When BaF3 and BaF3p185 cells were treated with imatinib (the latter being rescued with IL-3), no effect on either telomerase activity or telomere length was observed. These findings can be explained by the cytoplasmatic localization of BCR-ABL found in BaF3p185 as compared to the nuclear localization of telomerase (and c-ABL).;As opposed to recent reports for c-ABL, we do not see evidence for a functional interaction between BCR-ABL and hTERT in this model system arguing against imatinib-mediated upregulation of hTERT as a crucial factor for clonal selection and disease progression of CML.",

Epidemiologic data indicates that almost 5000 new cases are reported every year and 10% of these patients eventually succumb to the disease. The treatment of CML was revolutionized by the introduction of imatinib mesylate (IM, Gleevec), a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The clinical use of specific BCR-ABL inhibitors has resulted in a significantly improved prognosis, response rate, overall survival, and patient outcome in CML patients compared to previous therapeutic regimens. However, the complete eradication of CML in patients receiving imatinib was limited by the emergence of resistance mostly due to mutations in the ABL kinase domain and to a lesser extent by molecular residual disease after treatment. The second-generation BCR-ABL TKIs nilotinib (Tasigna) and dasatinib (Sprycel), showed significant activity in clinical trials in patients intolerant or resistant to imatinib therapy, except in those patients with the T315I BCR-ABL mutation. Identifying key components involved in the CML pathogenesis may lead to the exploration of new approaches that might eventually overcome resistance mediated to the BCR-ABL TKIs. Here, we present an overview about the current treatment of Ph+ CML patients with the TKIs and the obstacles to successful treatment with these drugs.",

The aim of this study was to estimate the reversal effects of down-regulation of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 1 (NHE1) on the chemoresistance of BCR-ABL-positive leukemia patients' cells and cell lines. After treatment with the specific NHE1 inhibitor cariporide to decrease intracellular pH (pHi), the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels of the K562R cell line and cells from IM-insensitive CML patients decreased. HO-1, as a Bcr/Abl-dependent survival molecule in CML cells, is important for the resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with newly diagnosed CML or IM-resistant CML. Silencing PKC-β and Nrf-2 or treatment with inhibitors of p38 pathways obviously blocked NHE1-induced HO-1 expression. Furthermore, treatment with HO-1 or p38 inhibitor plus IM increased the apoptosis of the K562R cell line and IM-insensitive CML patients' cells. Inhibiting HO-1 enhanced the activation of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1. Hence, the results support the anti-apoptotic role of HO-1 induced by NHE1 in the K562R cell line and IM-insensitive CML patients and provide a mechanism by which inducing HO-1 expression via the PKC-β/p38-MAPK pathway may promote tumor resistance to oxidative stress.

Immunological classification was assessed using a three-line panel of monoclonal antibodies for phenotypic characterization of leukemic blast cells as proposed at the First Latin American Consensus Conference for Flow Cytometric Immunophenotyping of Leukemia. We found 74 cases of B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), seven cases of T-cell ALL, and 19 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Applied in combination with immunophenotyping this knowledge led to improvement in diagnostic precision and refinement of immunological classification, ensuring the selection of the most appropriate therapy for the patients studied. In conclusion, intracellular Ags detection was of utmost importance in establishing correct lineage affiliation in cases lacking expression of B, T, or myeloid surface Ags or disclosing equivocal or ambiguous immunophenotypic features and in identifying biphenotypic acute leukemia.

In particular, mouse models of CML have greatly facilitated the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathogenesis of this disease and have led to the identification of new drug targets that in some cases offer the possibility of functional cure. There are currently three established CML mouse models: the BCR-ABL transgenic model, the BCR-ABL retroviral transduction/transplantation model, and the xenotransplant immunodeficient model. Each has its own unique advantages and disadvantages. Depending on the question of interest, some models may be more appropriate than others. In this chapter, we describe a newly developed xenotransplant mouse model to determine the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents, either alone or in combination. The model facilitates the evaluation of the frequency of leukemic stem cells with long-term leukemia-initiating activity, a critical subcellular population that causes disease relapse and progression, through the utilization of primary CD34(+) CML stem/progenitor cells obtained from CML patients at diagnosis and prior to drug treatment. We have also investigated the effectiveness of new combination treatment strategies designed to prevent the development of leukemia in vivo using BCR-ABL (+) blast crisis cells as a model system. These types of in vivo studies are important for the prediction of individual patient responses to drug therapy, and have the potential to facilitate the design of personalized combination therapy strategies.

The juxtaposition of the bcr and abl genes produces a novel junctional amino acid sequence, which may be presented by antigen-presenting cells and recognized specifically by human T lymphocytes. We have generated a CD4+ T lymphocyte line (NG-1) which recognizes the peptide epitope (GFKQSSKALQR) in association with HLA-DRbeta1*0101-02. A comparison of antigen-presenting cells showed that CMRF-44+ blood dendritic cell presented a 12mer b3a2 peptide effectively.

Kinase activity was measured using Kinase-Glo Luminescent Kinase Assay Platform in recombinant WT and mutant (Q252H, Y253F, and T315I) Abl kinases. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined using MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The phosphorylation levels of Bcr-Abl initiated signaling proteins were analyzed using Western blotting.

Skin and liver biopsy revealed changes compatible with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Treatment with cyclosporin A (CSA) and prednisone was started, and the GVHD resolved. Fifteen months after PBPC transplantation he had a molecular relapse. Despite discontinuation of CSA, the patient progressed into blast crisis 7 months later.

Ph chromosome was identified in CML in 1960 and was found to clearly result from reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 (t(q;22)) (q34;q11). CML arises from a single pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell with the Ph chromosome and demonstration of the Ph chromosome in blood or marrow cells establishes and unequivocal diagnosis of CML. The Ph chromosome is recognized as the cytogenetic result of a rearrangement of the ABL gene on chromosome 9 and the BCL gene on chromosome 22, which leads to the creation of a BCR/ABL fusion gene on chromosome 22. Abnormal ABL-related protein with increased tyrosine kinase activity suggested a molecular mechanism of CML. The BCR/ABL fusion gene can be found not only in the chromosome but in interphase nuclei by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We employed both fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) and FISH to study the lineage involvement of individual stem cells and progenitor cells in patients with CML. Evidence of BCR/ABL fusion was found in pluripotent stem cells (CD34+, Thy1+), myeloid cells, B progenitor cells (CD34+, CD19+) and T/NK progenitor cells (CD34+, CD7+, CD5+) but not mature T cells (CD3+) or natural killer cells (CD3-, CD56+).

In this review, the authors discuss currently available therapies for CML, focusing on mechanisms of resistance to imatinib and treatment strategies to overcome resistance. Relevant articles were identified through searches of PubMed and abstracts from international hematology/oncology congresses. Additional information sources were identified from the bibliographies of these references and from the authors' own libraries and expertise. In vitro 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50) ) data alone are not sufficient to guide the choice of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in the presence of a mutant breakpoint cluster region-v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog (BCR-ABL) clone, because there is a lack of data regarding how well such IC(50) values correlate with clinical response. A small subset of BCR-ABL mutant clones have been associated with impaired responses to second-generation TKIs (tyrosine to histidine mutation at codon 253 [Y253H], glutamic acid to lysine or valine mutation at codon 255 [E255K/V], and phenylalanine to cysteine or valine mutation at codon 359 [F359C/V] for nilotinib; valine to leucine mutation at codon 299 [V299L] and F317L for dasatinib); neither nilotinib nor dasatinib is active against the threonine to isoleucine mutation at codon 315 (T315I). For each second-generation TKI, the detection of 1 of a small subset of mutations at the time of resistance may be helpful in the selection of second-line therapy [corrected]. For the majority of patients, comorbidities and drug safety profiles should be the basis for choosing a second-line agent. Clinical trial data from an evaluation of the response of specific mutant BCR-ABL clones to TKIs is needed to establish the role of mutation testing in the management of CML.",

These observations are clinically relevant; an increase in levels of DNMT3A in association with downregulation of miR-217 were noted in leukemia cells isolated from individuals with BCR/ABL TKI-resistant Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL) and CML. Further studies with TKI-resistant K562 cells found that forced expression of miR-217 inhibited expression of DNMT3A through a miR-217-binding site within the 3'-untranslated region of DNMT3A and sensitized these cells to growth inhibition mediated by the TKI. Of note, long-term exposure of K562 cells to dasatinib (10 nM) together with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzadC) (0.1 μM) potently inhibited proliferation of these cells in association with upregulation of miR-217 and downregulation of DNMT3A in vitro. In addition, a decrease in levels of DNMT3A and an increase in levels of miR-217 were noted in K562 tumors growing in immune-deficient mice that were treated with the combination of 5-AzadC and dasatinib. Taken together, Ph(+) leukemia cells acquire TKI resistance via downregulation of miR-217 and upregulation of DNMT3A.

However, imatinib failure is observed in around 25%-30% of patients. With the availability of second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and/or allogeneic transplantation, many of these patients with imatinib failure can still achieve durable cytogenetic and molecular responses. Early evidence of imatinib resistance, when the biology of the emerging leukemia might still be relatively favorable, is the best time to switch to second-line therapy. Close cytogenetic and molecular monitoring will facilitate early intervention in appropriate cases. However, caution should be used when interpreting minimal residual disease data, and the danger of inappropriate changes in therapy based on assay fluctuations should be recognized. A significant increase in the level of BCR-ABL to a level > 0.1% on the international scale (major molecular response) should prompt a repeat BCR-ABL assay, a mutation screen, and possibly marrow cytogenetics. What constitutes a significant increase depends on the laboratory-specific measurement reliability. The possibilities of poor compliance or drug interactions should be considered. If the repeat BCR-ABL assay, fluorescence in situ hybridization assay, or cytogenetics confirms loss of complete cytogenetic response or if a mutation is identified, a dose increase or a switch in therapy to a second-line kinase inhibitor might be indicated. At least until complete molecular response is achieved, regular real-time polymerase chain reaction monitoring reinforces the fact that leukemia is still present and that compliance is a challenge that requires ongoing vigilance from the patient and the clinician.",

CML was the first cancer to be associated with a defined genetic abnormality, BCR-ABL, that is necessary and sufficient for initiating chronic phase disease as well as the first cancer to be treated with molecular targeted therapy. Malignant progenitors or leukemia stem cells (LSCs) evolve as a result of both epigenetic and genetic events that alter hematopoietic progenitor differentiation, proliferation, survival, and self-renewal. LSCs are rare and divide less frequently, and thus, represent a reservoir for relapse and resistance to a molecularly targeted single agent. On subverting developmental processes normally responsible for maintaining robust life-long hematopoiesis, the LSCs are able to evade the majority of current cancer treatments that target rapidly dividing cells. Enthusiasm for the enormous success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors at controlling the chronic phase disease is tempered somewhat by the persistence of the LSC pool in the majority of the patients. Combined therapies targeting aberrant properties of LSC may obviate therapeutic resistance and relapse in advanced phase and therapeutically recalcitrant CML.",

To date, JAK2V617F has not been described in patients with reactive myeloproliferation, lymphoid disorders, or solid tumor.

This multiplex PCR enables the detection of M-BCR/ABL, m-BCR/ABL, TEL/ AML1, and MLL/AF4 fusion transcripts in one PCR reaction. However, the existence of splicing variants and different breakpoints on the DNA level hampers the discrimination of the rearrangements by their fragment size on an agarose gel. Therefore, one of the internal primers of each translocation (ABL-2, TEL-2, AF4-2) was labeled with a characteristic fluorescent dye, and an automatic fluorescence-based DNA fragment analysis was performed. The sensitivity of this multiplex PCR is in the same range as that of the corresponding single PCR reaction and allows a fast screening for the detection of therapy-relevant rearrangements, with a high turnover of samples.",

BCR-ABL is inhibited by imatinib; however, several mechanisms of imatinib resistance have been proposed that account for loss of imatinib efficacy in patients with CML. Previously, we showed that overexpression of the efflux drug transporter P-glycoprotein partially contributed to imatinib resistance in imatinib-resistant K562 CML cells having no BCR-ABL mutations. To explain an additional mechanism of drug resistance, we established a subclone (K562/R) of the cells and examined the BCR-ABL signaling pathway in these and wild-type K562 (K562/W) cells. We found the K562/R cells were 15 times more resistant to imatinib than their wild-type counterparts. In both cell lines, BCR-ABL and its downstream signaling molecules, such as ERK1/2, ERK5, STAT5, and AKT, were phosphorylated in the absence of imatinib. In both cell lines, imatinib effectively reduced the phosphorylation of all the above, except ERK1/2, whose phosphorylation was, interestingly, only inhibited in the wild-type cells. We then observed that phospho-ERK1/2 levels decreased in the presence of siRNA targeting BCR-ABL, again, only in the K562/W cells. However, using an ERK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, we found that we could reduce phospho-ERK1/2 levels in K562/R cells and restore their sensitivity to imatinib. Taken together, we conclude that the BCR-ABL-independent activation of ERK1/2 contributes to imatinib resistance in K562/R cells, and that ERK1/2 could be a target for the treatment of CML patients whose imatinib resistance is due to this mechanism.",

Unfortunately, few CSC-specific genes have been identified. Here, we determined that the gene encoding arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (Alox15/15-LO) is essential for the survival of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in a murine model of BCR-ABL-induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In the absence of Alox15, BCR-ABL was unable to induce CML in mice. Furthermore, Alox15 deletion impaired LSC function by affecting cell division and apoptosis, leading to an eventual depletion of LSCs. Moreover, chemical inhibition of 15-LO function impaired LSC function and attenuated CML in mice. The defective CML phenotype in Alox15-deficient animals was rescued by depleting the gene encoding P-selectin, which is upregulated in Alox15-deficient animals. Both deletion and overexpression of P-selectin affected the survival of LSCs. In human CML cell lines and CD34+ cells, knockdown of Alox15 or inhibition of 15-LO dramatically reduced survival. Loss of Alox15 altered expression of PTEN, PI3K/AKT, and the transcription factor ICSBP, which are known mediators of cancer pathogenesis. These results suggest that ALOX15 has potential as a therapeutic target for eradicating LSCs in CML. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is the consequence of a single balanced translocation that produces the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene which is detectable in over 90% of patients at presentation. The BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM) has improved survival in all phases of CML and is the standard of care for newly diagnosed patients in chronic phase. Despite the very significant therapeutic benefits of IM, a small minority of patients with early stage disease do not benefit optimally while IM therapy in patients with advanced disease is of modest benefit in many. Diverse mechanisms may be responsible for IM failures, with point mutations within the Bcr-Abl kinase domain being amongst the most common resistance mechanisms described in patients with advanced CML. The development of novel agents designed to overcome IM resistance, while still primarily targeted on BCR-ABL, led to the creation of the high affinity aminopyrimidine inhibitor, nilotinib. Nilotinib is much more potent as a BCR-ABL inhibitor than IM and inhibits both wild type and IM-resistant BCR-ABL with significant clinical activity across the entire spectrum of BCR-ABL mutants with the exception of T315I. The selection of a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor to rescue patients with imatinib failure will be based on several factors including age, co-morbid medical problems and ABL kinase mutational profile. It should be noted that while the use of targeted BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors in CML represents a paradigm shift in CML management these agents are not likely to have activity against the quiescent CML stem cell pool. The purpose of this review is to summarize the pre-clinical and clinical data on nilotinib in patients with CML who have failed prior therapy with IM or dasatinib.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) originates in a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell of the bone marrow and is characterized by greatly increased numbers of granulocytes in the blood. Myeloid and other hematopoietic cell lineages are involved in the process of clonal proliferation and differentiation. After a period of 4-6 years the disease progresses to acute-stage leukemia. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. Most of ABL is linked with a truncated BCR. The BCR/ABL fusion gene codes for an 8-kb mRNA and a novel 210-kDa protein which has higher and aberrant tyrosine kinase activity than the normal c-ABL-coded counterpart. Phosphorylation of a number of substrates such as GAP, GRB-2, SHC, FES, CRKL, and paxillin is considered a decisive step in transformation. An etiological connection between BCR/ABL and leukemia is indicated by the observation that transgenic mice bearing a BCR/ABL DNA construct develop leukemia of B, T, and myeloid cell origin. CML cells proliferate and expand in an almost unlimited manner. Adhesion defects in bone marrow stromal cells have been proposed to explain the increased number of leukemic cells in the peripheral blood. However, findings of our laboratory have shown that the BCR/ABL chimeric protein that is expressed in transfected cells may, under certain conditions, also increase the adhesion to fibronectin via enhanced expression of integrin. Our previous immunocytological studies on the expression of beta1 and beta2 integrins have found no qualitative differences between normal and CML hematopoietic cells in vitro. Even long-term-cultured CML bone marrow or blood cells continuously express those adhesion molecules that are characteristic of the cytological type. Recent experiments indicate that certain early CML progenitors may adhere to the stromal layer in vitro similarly to their normal counterparts. They cannot be completely removed by long-term culture on allogeneic stromal cells. At present, the only curative therapy is transplantation of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells. Based on the molecular and cellular state of knowledge of CML, new therapies are being developed. BCR/ABL antisense oligonucleotides, inhibitors of tyrosine kinase, peptide-specific adoptive immunotherapy or peptide vaccination, and restoration of hematopoiesis by autologous stem cell transplantation following CML cell purging are examples of important approaches to improving CML treatment.",

We compared the results with results of Southern blot analysis and karyotyping when available. Cost analysis was performed. Thirty-three samples were evaluable by FISH; 14 of 14 evaluable CML samples and one ALL sample were positive for bcr-abl by FISH (100%).

An infectious etiology has been suspected and the role of the Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) has been suggested. Several studies have tried to establish a link between HHV-6 infections and hematological malignancies, with discordant results. The potential role of HHV-6 in the pathogenesis of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia was investigated. HHV-6 genome copy number was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (RQ-PCR) in bone marrow or peripheral blood samples obtained from 36 children (median age = 4 years) with B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 31) and T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 5) at diagnosis and during complete remission. Positive samples were further characterized to define viral variant, A or B. A total of 24.7% of samples were positive for HHV-6 genome: 13.9% were leukemia samples and 34.1% were complete remission samples. Viral load was low with values lower at diagnosis (median viral copy number = 22.9) than at complete remission (median copy number = 60.1). Among the 17 patients with positive samples, 15 were typed as B-variant whereas 2 could not be typed. These results argue against a role of HHV6 infection in the development of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. They also suggest that HHV-6 may infect latently bone marrow progenitors but seems not able to infect leukemic cells, raising again the question of the mechanism of virus fusion and entry.

Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL, has been the mainstay of first-line therapy for CML for 10 years. Although patients with CML-CP respond well to imatinib, those who have delayed reductions in leukemic burden during imatinib therapy, such as not achieving a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) by 12 months, have an increased risk of disease progression. It has been recognized, with 8 years of observation, that patients who achieve an early major molecular response (MMR) on imatinib have a very low probability of disease progression. Recent randomized phase 3 trials have shown that first-line treatment with dasatinib or nilotinib-more potent BCR-ABL inhibitors-results in significantly higher rates and more rapid achievement of CCyR and MMR in comparison with standard-dose imatinib. These trials suggest that CML treatment can be improved with more potent BCR-ABL inhibition during initial therapy, but further follow-up is needed to confirm that the improved response rates with dasatinib and nilotinib are maintained long term.",

By means of immunostaining (CD34) and morphometry, a relationship between microvessel frequency and fiber density was detectable in initial bone marrow (BM) biopsies and sequential examinations after at least 8 months of therapy. First-line monotherapy with imatinib induced a significant reduction (normalization in comparison with controls) of microvessels and reticulin fibers. In most patients, decrease in BM vascularity was associated with a complete cytogenetic response. A significant anti-angiogenic effect was also observed after HU treatment, contrasting with IFN administration or combination regimens (IFN plus HU).

The success of this approach relies on the identification of molecular pathways that selectively regulate CSC function. Using BCR-ABL-induced chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as a disease model for CSCs, we show that BCR-ABL downregulates the Blk gene (encoding B-lymphoid kinase) through c-Myc in leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in CML mice and that Blk functions as a tumor suppressor in LSCs but does not affect normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or hematopoiesis. Blk suppresses LSC function through a pathway involving an upstream regulator, Pax5, and a downstream effector, p27. Inhibition of this Blk pathway accelerates CML development, whereas increased activity of the Blk pathway delays CML development. Blk also suppresses the proliferation of human CML stem cells.

In all patients, FISH detected 1% to 12% nuclei with a BCR-ABL fusion gene, whereas Q-RT-PCR were negative or weakly positive. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the BCR-ABL genomic rearrangement remains unexpressed in a small percentage of cells whatever the treatment (IFN-alpha or BMT), and this in spite of the negativity of the RT-PCR-based classical molecular remission criterion. These data corroborate those obtained by other investigators and point to the need for follow-up of CML patients in CCR over an extensive period, at the DNA level to evaluate the residual disease and at the RNA level (Q-RT-PCR) to estimate the risk of relapse and guide the therapeutic decision.

Morphometric analysis confirmed the significant decrease in the number of micromegakaryocytes and yielded planimetric parameters in keeping with normalization. Moreover, a fluorescence in-situ hybridization study in five patients of this cohort revealed that before therapy 70% of all myeloid cells exhibited the bcr/abl gene. Regarding megakaryopoiesis about 65% of the micromegakaryocytes displayed positive signals.

For signaling transformation and proliferation activities in CML, Bcr-Abl is the pivotal protein. As downstream signals of Bcr-Abl , RAS, PI3-K, and Stat 5 may lead to cell cycle progression mediated by increased expression of cyclin Ds. We analyzed copy numbers of bcr-abl and cyclin D1 transcripts by reverse transcription (RT) and competitive PCR titration in bone marrow cells of 20 patients with CML, 10 in chronic phase (CP) and the other 10 in accelerated phase (AP). The level of bcr-abl transcripts in the AP was not significantly higher than that in the CP; in contrast, the level of cyclin D1 transcripts in the AP was significantly higher than that in the CP (p <0.001). Cyclin D1 RNA expression in the CP of CML was also found to have clinical relevance to time to AP transformation. The median time to AP transformation for the CP patients with cyclin D1 transcripts of 1.50 x 10(4)/microg RNA was significantly shorter than that for those with cyclin D1 transcripts < 1.50 x 10(4)/microg RNA (15 vs. 67 months, p=0.0354) although confirmation to conduct in a larger patient group is required. These results suggest that the expression level of cyclin D1 RNA in bone marrow cells is predictive of the phase evolution in CML and may be helpful in treatment decision-making.",

However, it is now well documented that even genetically wild-type tumor suppressors can be involved in tumorigenesis, when functionally inactivated. In particular, tumor suppressors' functions can be impaired by subtle variations of protein levels, changes in cellular compartmentalization and post-transcriptional/post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation. Notably, tumor suppressors inactivation offers challenging therapeutic opportunities. The reactivation of an inactive and genetically wild-type tumor suppressor could indeed promote selective apoptosis of cancer cells without affecting normal cells.;Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) could be considered as the paradigm for non-genomic loss of function of tumor suppressors due to the ability of BCR-ABL to directly promote functionally inactivation of several tumor suppressors.;In this review we will describe new insights on the role of FoxO, PP2A, p27, BLK, PTEN and other tumor suppressors in CML pathogenesis.

We recently have identified the heat shock protein 32 (Hsp32)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) as a BCR/ABL-dependent survival molecule in CML cells. We here show that silencing Hsp32/HO-1 in CML cells by an siRNA approach results in induction of apoptosis. Moreover, targeting Hsp32/HO-1 by either pegylated zinc protoporphyrine (PEG-ZnPP) or styrene maleic acid-micelle-encapsulated ZnPP (SMA-ZnPP) resulted in growth inhibition of BCR/ABL-transformed cells. The effects of PEG-ZnPP and SMA-ZnPP were demonstrable in Ba/F3 cells carrying various imatinib-resistant mutants of BCR/ABL, including the T315I mutant, which exhibits resistance against all clinically available BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Growth-inhibitory effects of PEG-ZnPP and SMA-ZnPP also were observed in the CML-derived human cell lines K562 and KU812 as well as in primary leukemic cells obtained from patients with freshly diagnosed CML or imatinib-resistant CML. Finally, Hsp32/HO-1-targeting compounds were found to synergize with either imatinib or nilotinib in producing growth inhibition in imatinib-resistant K562 cells and in Ba/F3 cells harboring the T315I mutant of BCR/ABL. In summary, these data show that HO-1 is a promising novel target in imatinib-resistant CML.",

Limitations of this technique include the reported low frequency of normal stem cells in CML and the difficulties in obtaining sufficient BM for manipulation. To address these problems we compared the apheresis product with the diagnostic bone marrow at diagnosis as a source of primitive BCR/ABL-negative progenitors. We analyzed the CD34+ HLA-DR- and CD34+CD38(-) populations in five CML patients to evaluate the frequency of BCR-ABL-negative progenitors and pre-progenitors in these populations. Progenitor analysis was performed by RT-PCR of individual hemopoietic colonies from a standard CFU-GM assay. Analysis of pre-progenitors involved RT-PCR of secondary colonies derived from a stroma-free pre-CFU assay. Our results show variable levels of BCR-ABL-negative progenitors in the 34+DR- population but very low levels of BCR-ABL-negative progenitors in the 34+38- population in blood. Analysis of pre-progenitors from the 34+DR- fraction of peripheral blood (PB) and BM showed 80-100% and 85-100% of colonies were BCR-ABL negative at days 14 and 28, respectively. Analysis of pre-progenitors from the 34+38- fraction of PB and BM showed 23-100% and 42-100% of colonies were BCR-ABL negative at days 14 and 28, respectively. In summary, pre-progenitors from the 34+DR- and 34+38- populations are predominantly BCR-ABL negative in both marrow and blood at diagnosis. Apheresis product collected at diagnosis is a more abundant sources of BCR-ABL-negative pre-progenitors than BM.

Clinical outcomes in CML were revolutionized by development of Bcr-abl-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but CML is not cured by these agents. CML leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are relatively TKI insensitive and persist even in remission. LSC persistence results in relapse upon TKI discontinuation, or drug resistance or blast crisis (BC) during prolonged treatment. We hypothesize that increased expression of Fas-associated phosphatase 1 (Fap1) in CML contributes to LSC persistence and BC. As Fap1 substrates include Fas and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (Gsk3β), increased Fap1 activity in CML is anticipated to induce Fas resistance and stabilization of β-catenin protein. Resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis may contribute to CML LSC persistence, and β-catenin activity increases during BC. In the current study, we directly tested the role of Fap1 in CML LSC persistence using in an in vivo murine model. In TKI-treated mice, we found that inhibiting Fap1, using a tripeptide or small molecule, prevented TKI resistance, BC and relapse after TKI discontinuation; all events observed with TKI alone. In addition, Fap1 inhibition increased Fas sensitivity and decreased β-catenin activity in CD34(+) bone marrow cells from human subjects with CML. Therapeutic Fap1 inhibition may permit TKI discontinuation and delay in progression in CML. ",

Here, we show that the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis at much lower concentrations in Ton.B210 cells when driven by inducibly expressed BCR/ABL than when driven by interleukin-3. The increased sensitivity to sorafenib was also observed in cells inducibly expressing BCR/ABL with the imatinib-resistant E255K or T315I mutation. Sorafenib-induced apoptosis in these cells and Ph+ leukemic cells was synergistically enhanced by rottlerin, bortezomib, or ABT-737 and inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor BOC-d-fmk or the overexpression of Bcl-XL. It was further revealed that sorafenib activates Bax and caspase-3 and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential specifically in BCR/ABL-driven cells. Sorafenib also inhibited BCR/ABL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of its cellular substrates and its autophosphorylation in Ton.B210. It was finally shown that sorafenib inhibits the kinase activity of BCR/ABL as well as its E255K and T315I mutants in in vitro kinase assays. These results indicate that sorafenib induces apoptosis of BCR/ABL-expressing cells, at least partly, by inhibiting BCR/ABL to activate the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. Thus, sorafenib may provide an effective therapeutic measure to treat Ph+ leukemias, particularly those expressing the T315I mutant, which is totally resistant to imatinib and the second generation BCR/ABL inhibitors.",

Thus, the efficient delivery of target gene-specific siRNAs is one major challenge in the establishment of therapeutic RNAi. Here we show that in vivo application of targeted nonvirally delivered synthetic bcr-abl siRNA in a female patient with recurrent Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) resistant to imatinib (Y253F mutation) and chemotherapy after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can silence the expression of bcr-abl gene. We found a remarkable inhibition of the overexpressed bcr-abl oncogene resulting in increased apoptosis of CML cells. In vivo siRNA application was well tolerated without any clinically adverse events. Our findings imply that the clinical application of synthetic siRNA is feasible, safe and has real potential for genetic-based therapies using synthetic nonviral carriers.",

The treatment strategies are highly individualized with patients in the early and stable stages typically not requiring treatment. However, those with progressive or clinically advanced disease will require treatment. Cytotoxic drugs, such as the alkylating agents, purine nucleoside antagonists, and immunotherapeutic agents, have been the mainstay of chemotherapeutic treatment in CLL. However, given the lack of therapeutic specificity, these medications (especially older ones) have limited tolerability due to side effects. In this paper, we will discuss the data on the use of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor Idelalisib in the management of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The preclinical and clinical data thus far demonstrate that Idelalisib produces a dramatic and durable response in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and without causing significant toxicity. Moving forward, the ongoing clinical trials will help address the various questions currently being raised regarding the long-term application and safety of Idelalisib. With greater clinical experience following more widespread use of Idelalisib, we will be able to determine the optimal combination therapies in treatment-naïve and relapsed/refractory patients, resulting in more individualized therapeutic strategies for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

With progression of CML disease especially in blast crisis stage, cells from CML patients become resistant to imatinib mesylate (IM) and other TKIs, resulting in relapse. Because Bcr-Abl is known to drive multiple signaling pathways, the study of the regulation of stability of Bcr-Abl in IM-resistant CML cells is a critical issue as a possible therapeutic strategy. Here, we report that a new dual-kinase chemical inhibitor, ON044580, induced apoptosis of Bcr-Abl+ IM-sensitive, IM-resistant cells, including the gatekeeper Bcr-Abl mutant, T315I, and also cells from blast crisis patients. In addition, IM-resistant K562-R cells, cells from blast crisis CML patients, and all IM-resistant cell lines tested had reduced ability to form colonies in soft agar in the presence of 0.5 µM ON044580. In in vitro kinase assays, ON044580 inhibited the recombinant Jak2 and Abl kinase activities when the respective Jak2 and Abl peptides were used as substrates. Incubation of the Bcr-Abl+ cells with ON044580 rapidly reduced the levels of the Bcr-Abl protein and also reduced the expression of HSP90 and its client protein levels. Lysates of Bcr-Abl+ cell lines were found to contain a large signaling network complex composed of Bcr-Abl, Jak2, HSP90, and its client proteins as detected by a gel filtration column chromatography, which was rapidly disrupted by ON044580. Therefore, targeting Jak2 and Bcr-Abl kinases is an effective way to destabilize Bcr-Abl and its network complex, which leads to the onset of apoptosis in IM-sensitive and IM-resistant Bcr-Abl+ cells. This inhibitory strategy has potential to manage all types of drug-resistant CML cells, especially at the terminal blast crisis stage of CML, where TKIs are not clinically useful.",

However, Bcr-Abl also modulates Skp2 protein stability in these cells. Treatment of Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib led to G1 growth arrest accompanied with reduced Skp2 expression. Interestingly, reduction of Skp2 protein occurred prior to down-regulation of Skp2 mRNA suggesting a post-translational control. The half-life of Skp2 protein was significantly attenuated in imatinib-treated cells. These effects are not cell line specific because similar results were also found in CML cells obtained from patients. Knockdown of Bcr-Abl similarly caused Skp2 protein instability. The decrease of Skp2 was induced by increased protein degradation through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Imatinib treatment or Bcr-Abl knockdown reduced Emi1, an endogenous inhibitor of the E3 ligase APC/Cdh1 which mediated Skp2 degradation. We found that Emi1 stability was regulated by phosphorylation and mutation of tyrosine 142 reduced the stability. Our data suggested Bcr-Abl-induced Emi1 phosphorylation might be mediated by Src kinase. Firstly, Src inhibitor SU6656 inhibited Emi1 tyrosine phosphorylation in K562 cells. Secondly, transfection of v-Src rescued the reduction of Emi1 by imatinib. Thirdly, mutation of tyrosine 142 to phenylalanine (Y142F) abolished the phosphorylation of Emi1 by recombinant Src kinase. In addition, ectopic expression of wild type but not Y142F mutant Emi1 counteracted imatinib-caused growth arrest. Collectively, our results suggest that Bcr-Abl increases Emi1 phosphorylation and stability to prevent Skp2 protein degradation via APC/Cdh1-induced ubiquitination and to enhance proliferation of CML cells.",

Importantly, the IKK2 inhibitor strongly decreased in vitro survival and ability to form hematopoietic colonies of primary imatinib resistant CML cells including T315I cells. Our data strongly support the targeting of NF-kappaB as a promising new therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of imatinib resistant CML patients in particular in the case of T315I patients. The T315I mutation escapes all currently used Bcr-Abl inhibitors and is likely to become a major clinical problem as it is associated with a poor clinical outcome.",

To repair these lesions BCR/ABL stimulate unfaithful DSB repair pathways, homologous recombination repair (HRR), nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), and single-strand annealing (SSA). Here, we show that BCR/ABL enhances the expression and increase nuclear localization of WRN (mutated in Werner syndrome), which is required for processing DSB ends during the repair. Other fusion tyrosine kinases (FTK), such as TEL/ABL, TEL/JAK2, TEL/PDGFβR, and NPM/ALK also elevate WRN. BCR/ABL induces WRN mRNA and protein expression in part by c-MYC-mediated activation of transcription and Bcl-xL-dependent inhibition of caspase-dependent cleavage, respectively. WRN is in complex with BCR/ABL resulting in WRN tyrosine phosphorylation and stimulation of its helicase and exonuclease activities. Activated WRN protects BCR/ABL-positive cells from the lethal effect of oxidative and genotoxic stresses, which causes DSBs. In addition, WRN promotes unfaithful recombination-dependent repair mechanisms HRR and SSA, and enhances the loss of DNA bases during NHEJ in leukemia cells. In summary, we postulate that BCR/ABL-mediated stimulation of WRN modulates the efficiency and fidelity of major DSB repair mechanisms to protect leukemia cells from apoptosis and to facilitate genomic instability.",

In a murine retroviral bone marrow transduction-transplantation model, a Tel (exon 1-5)-Abl fusion protein induced 2 distinct illnesses: a CML-like myeloproliferative disease very similar to that induced by Bcr-Abl but with increased latency and a novel syndrome characterized by small-bowel myeloid cell infiltration and necrosis, increased circulating endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels, and fulminant hepatic and renal failure. Induction of both diseases required the Tel pointed homology oligomerization domain and Abl tyrosine kinase activity. Myeloid cells from mice with both diseases expressed Tel-Abl protein. CML-like disease induced by Tel-Abl and Bcr-Abl was polyclonal and originated from cells with multilineage (myeloid, erythroid, and B- and T-lymphoid) repopulating ability and the capacity to generate day-12 spleen colonies in secondary transplantations.

One possible target for specific GVL activity is the bcr-abl fusion protein characteristic of CML. We have investigated the use of normal peptide-pulsed dendritic cells for the generation of cytotoxic, bcr-abl-specific T cells from normal donors. T cells (CD3+, CD8+, TCR alpha beta+, and NK receptor-negative) generated from a normal donor (HLA A24, B52, B59, Cw1) after stimulation with autologous dendritic cells, primed with a 16 mer peptide spanning the b3a2 breakpoint of bcr-abl, lysed CML cells from the peripheral blood of seven patients with CML with the b3a2 breakpoint. CML cells from four patients with only the b2a2 breakpoint were not lysed. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) blasts derived from peripheral blood of patients with CML were not lysed, suggesting that cytotoxicity was not due to alloreactivity. Blocking experiments with anti-HLA-A,B,C indicated that cytotoxicity was dependent on recognition of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, although cytotoxicity was not MHC-restricted because not all patients shared HLA types with the T-cell donor. Specificity for bcr-abl and absence of alloreactivity was confirmed by the presence of lytic activity against autologous and allogeneic class I HLA-A matched monocytes pulsed with the 16 mer bcr-abl fusion peptide, but not against unpulsed monocytes or monocytes pulsed with other peptides. These results show that bcr-abl-specific T cells with marked cytotoxic activity against CML cells can be generated and amplified from normal donor peripheral blood.

Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the two possible mRNA breakpoints were found to inhibit cell growth of CML patient cells and cell lines, but doubt exists about their specificity. In order to test the specificity, phosphorothioate and 3' phosphorothioate capped antisense BCR-ABL oligonucleotides of different length were used. Stability, cellular uptake of oligonucleotides and effect on cell growth were studied in two CML cell lines, BV173 and LAMA-84. Phosphorothioate antisense BCR-ABL oligonucleotides were most stable, showed the highest uptake and induced cell death in BV173 but not in LAMA-84 cells. We selected the most effective antisense oligonucleotide for further analysis. The BV173 and LAMA-84 cell lines do not express the normal c-abl protein, we therefore used a c-abl specific monoclonal antibody for the detection of p210bcr-abl expression by flow cytometry. Dead cells found after treatment were gated out of analysis. Although BCR-ABL antisense oligonucleotides can induce apoptosis, no reduction of p210bcr-abl levels could be detected in living cells after treatment with antisense oligonucleotides. We conclude that antisense mediated inhibition of translation of mRNA into p210bcr-abl is not the mechanism responsible for the induction of apoptosis in cell line BV173.",

Since the preclinical phase of their development, most of these inhibitors have been tested in in vitro studies to assess their half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) for unmutated and mutated Bcr-Abl-that is, the drug concentration required to inhibit the cell proliferation or the phosphorylation processes driven by either the unmutated or the mutated forms of the kinase. A number of such studies have been published, and now that two inhibitors-dasatinib and nilotinib-are available for the treatment of imatinib-resistant cases, it is tempting for clinicians to reason on the IC₅₀ values to guess, case by case, which one will work best in patients harboring specific Bcr-Abl KD mutations.

The dramatic success of the Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib as therapy for CML has inspired interest in other PTKs as targets for cancer drug discovery. Here we report a novel PTK activity and inhibition screening method using hydrogel-immobilized peptide substrates. Using acrylate crosslinkers, we tether peptides via terminal cysteines to thiol-presenting hydrogels in 96-well plates. These surfaces display low background and high reproducibility, allowing semiquantitative detection of peptide phosphorylation by recombinant c-Abl or by Bcr-Abl activity in cell extracts using traditional anti-phosphotyrosine immunodetection and chemifluorescence. The capabilities of this assay are demonstrated by performing model screens for inhibition with several commercially available PTK inhibitors and a collection of pyridopyrimidine Src/Abl dual inhibitors.

However, resistance and intolerance have frequently been reported, particularly in patients with advanced-stage disease. Point mutations within the ABL kinase domain that interfere with imatinib binding are the most critical cause of imatinib resistance. To overcome this resistance, four second-generation ATP competitive ABL TKIs, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib and bafetinib, have been developed. Dasatinib and nilotinib also demonstrated higher efficacy than imatinib in previously untreated CML patients in chronic phase. Despite promising clinical results, the frequently observed mutant T315I is not effectively targeted by any of the second-generation ABL TKIs. Thus, a third-generation ABL TKI, ponatinib, was developed to inhibit all mutated BCR-ABL and showed clinical efficacy in CML cells harbouring T315I. CML treatment is rapidly progressing and further evolution is surely expected. Moreover, it was recently reported that some CML patients who achieved sustained complete molecular response could stop TKI.

The identification of these rearrangements provides critical diagnostic and prognostic information, which may contribute to the selection of specific anti-leukemic therapy. The translocation t(9;22), the equivalent of the BCR/ABL rearrangement, is associated with a poor prognosis. We therefore used RT-PCR to detect this molecular event in a prospective study including 890 children. 673 of them suffered from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at primary diagnosis and a transcription of the chimeric gene was detected in 21 of 648 with a successful analysis (3.2%). All children were treated by one of the two German multicenter childhood ALL therapy studies ALL-BFM-90 or COALL-05-92, respectively. Comparison of clinical features between BCR/ABL-positive and -negative children showed no significant differences regarding WBC, percentage of blasts, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and age. Immunophenotypic studies at diagnosis in 21 BCR/ABL-positive children identified common ALL in 16 patients (76.2%), pre-B-ALL in four (19.0%), and an early T-lineage ALL in one (4.8%). Coexpression of myeloid antigens (CD13 and/or CD33) was observed in six of 16 common ALL patients as well as in the one child with early T-lineage ALL phenotype. The type of breakpoint (m-BCR/ABL: n = 14; M-BCR/ABL: n = 7) showed no correlation with clinical parameters. A comparison of cytogenetic and molecular data was performed in 16 positive patients and was concordant in all of them. We analyzed the response to the prednisone pretreatment and found a higher incidence of poor responders among the BCR/ABL-positive children.

In contrast, imatinib mesylate effectively eliminated BCR-ABL(+) KIT(+)-expressing leukemic cells. In the cellular context of mature myeloid cells and Pro/Pre B cells that do not express KIT, monospecific BCR-ABL inhibition was quantitatively as effective as imatinib mesylate in suppressing cell growth and inducing apoptosis.

CML was the first malignancy in which a unique chromosomal abnormality was identified and a pathophysiologic association was suggested. The hallmark of CML is a reciprocal chromosomal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9; 22)(q34; q11), creating a derivative 9q+ and a shortened 22q-. The latter, known as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, harbors the breakpoint cluster region-abelson (BCR-ABL) fusion gene, encoding the constitutively active BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase that is necessary and sufficient for initiating CML. The successful implementation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the treatment of CML remains a flagship for molecularly targeted therapy in cancer. TKIs have changed the clinical course of CML; however, some patients nonetheless demonstrate primary or secondary resistance to such therapy and require an alternative therapeutic strategy. Therefore, the assessment of early response to treatment with TKIs has become an important tool in the clinical monitoring of CML patients. Although mutations in the BCR-ABL have proven to be the most prominent mechanism of resistance to TKIs, other mechanisms-either rendering the leukemic cells still dependent on BCR-ABL activity or supporting oncogenic properties of the leukemic cells independent of BCR-ABL signaling-have been identified. This article provides an overview of the current understanding of CML pathogenesis; recommendations for diagnostic tools, treatment strategies, and management guidelines; and highlights the BCR-ABL-dependent and -independent mechanisms that contribute to the development of resistance to TKIs.

Additionally, the review discusses advances in the basic understanding of the mechanisms by which these three different therapies function against chronic myeloid leukemia.;Long-term follow-up has found that interferon-alpha was able to produce complete cytogenetic remission in15 to 25% of patients, with some of these patients achieving a molecular remission. Some patients who achieve a complete cytogenetic remission also achieve long-term disease-free survival and possibly cure. Imatinib has produced remarkable hematologic and cytogenetic responses in newly treated and in interferon-alpha-refractory patients, yet there are no long-term survival data at this point. Some laboratory findings imply that imatinib may primarily affect mature chronic myeloid leukemia progenitors and not chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells, leaving doubt that the improved rate of complete cytogenetic remissions will result in increased overall survival. Other clonal cytogenetic abnormalities have also been reported in the Philadelphia chromosome-negative cells present in complete cytogenetic remissions to imatinib. The use of donor lymphocytes infusion (DLI) continues to treat relapsed chronic myeloid leukemia effectively after allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation whereas the use of nonmyeloablative therapy has effectively reduced transplant-related mortality.;Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia now have several potential treatment options from which to choose. Imatinib mesylate currently provides excellent hematologic and cytogenetic response rates with minimal toxicity. However, long-term data of efficacy is lacking. Emerging evidence that imatinib rarely leads to molecular complete remission and that many patients are still at risk of relapse and other clonal disorders is concerning and suggest the possibility that imatinib's early high response rates may not translate into survival advantage. Interferon-alpha continues to be effective therapy for many patients and, along with blood or marrow transplantation, is proved to prolong survival. The impacts of both are in part limited because of their toxicity profiles. Ongoing laboratory investigations and clinical trials remain paramount to providing the best treatment approach for our patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.",

Ninety-three patients had evaluable PCR assays for both the p190bcr-abl and p210bcr-abl type of BCR-ABL gene rearrangements. Twenty-one of 93 patients (23%) were positive for the BCR-ABL rearrangement by the PCR assay. Fourteen of these patients had the p210brc-abl BCR-ABL rearrangement characteristically seen in CML patients, while seven had the p190bcr-abl rearrangement seen in ALL alone. Of 61 patients analyzed, both with conventional cytogenetics and PCR, eight (13%) were positive for the Ph1, while 14 (23%) were positive for the BCR-ABL rearrangement by the PCR assay. Discordance between the PCR assay and cytogenetics occurred in eight cases where the PCR assay was positive and the cytogenetics negative, and two cases where the PCR assay was negative and cytogenetics positive. PCR positivity did not correlate with treatment response, survival, or relapse-free survival, but there was a higher percentage of L2 FAB morphology in the PCR+ cases compared to the PCR-cases (67 vs. 28%, p = 0.003). In addition, the data suggested that patients with a p190bcr-abl rearrangement have a better response to induction therapy, but a worse relapse-free survival compared to patients with a p210bcr-abl breakpoint, but these differences were not statistically significant. These data suggest that PCR and conventional cytogenetics may provide complementary information, since there appear to be a subset of patients who are Ph1-negative yet BCR-ABL positive by PCR. Further studies will be required to determine the prognostic significance of the detailed information about BCR-ABL breakpoints that is available from the PCR assay.",

Since these chimeric proteins are expressed only in leukemic cells they have the potential to serve as tumor-specific antigens for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Using the 12B1 murine leukemia cell line, derived by retroviral transformation of BALB/c bone marrow cells with the bcr-abl (b3a2) fusion gene, we have demonstrated that intravenous inoculation of 12B1 cells into BALB/c mice results in a disseminated acute leukemia analogous to human CML in blast crisis. Histological sections of liver and spleen and polymerase chain reaction analysis of peripheral blood, bone marrow, liver, spleen and lymph nodes confirmed the presence of bcr-abl+ leukemia cells in these murine tissues, while Western blot data demonstrated the expression of the fusion protein in 12B1 cells. Immunization of mice with dendritic cells (DC) loaded with the synthetic bcr-abl chimeric nonapeptide, GFKQSSKAL, led to a 150 times higher frequency of bcr-abl-specific CTL precursors in the spleen than in mice immunized with peptide alone. In vitro re-stimulation of DC-peptide-primed splenocytes resulted in substantial secretion of interferon gamma and augmented cytolytic activity against 12B1 targets. Finally, vaccination with peptide-loaded DC significantly prolonged survival of BALB/c mice that were challenged with 12B1 leukemia. The capacity to generate bcr-abl-specific CTL in vivo by DC-based immunization may have clinical implications in the treatment of CML.",

In addition, leukemia cells could repair these lesions more efficiently than normal cells and eventually survive genotoxic treatment. Elevated levels of drug-induced DSBs in leukemia cells were associated with higher activity of ATR kinase, and enhanced phosphorylation of histone H2AX on serine 139 (gamma-H2AX). gamma-H2AX eventually started to disappear in BCR/ABL cells, while continued to increase in parental cells. In addition, the expression and ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Chk1 kinase on serine 345 were often more abundant in BCR/ABL-positive leukemia cells than normal counterparts after genotoxic treatment. Inhibition of ATR kinase by caffeine but not Chk1 kinase by indolocarbazole inhibitor, SB218078 sensitized BCR/ABL leukemia cells to MMC in a short-term survival assay. Nevertheless, both caffeine and SB218078 enhanced the genotoxic effect of MMC in a long-term clonogenic assay. This effect was associated with the abrogation of transient accumulation of leukemia cells in S and G2/M cell cycle phases after drug treatment. In conclusion, ATR-Chk1 axis was strongly activated in BCR/ABL-positive cells and contributed to the resistance to DNA cross-linking agents causing numerous replication-dependent DSBs.",

Chimerism was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (VNTR [variable number of tandem repeats]-PCR) analysis in highly purified CD19+, CD3+, CD15+, and CD56+ cell fractions, whereas MRD was investigated in whole blood by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) of both p210(BCR-ABL) and p190(BCR-ABL) hybrid transcripts. Of 55 patients, 14 (including 6 T-cell-depleted patients) had cytogenetic relapse at 5-80 months and progressed to hematologic relapse, while 41 patients remained in prolonged cytogenetic remission 12-107 months post-BMT. Before leukemia recurrence, patients in the relapse group showed a consistent evolution pattern sequentially featured by persistent p210(BCR-ABL) positivity, increasing mixed chimerism (MC) in myeloid cells, p190(BCR-ABL) positivity, and, finally, cytogenetic relapse. Myeloid MC preceded cytogenetic relapse by 2-12 months, whereas p190(BCR/ABL) was detected 1-6 months prior to cytogenetic relapse in 11 patients and concomitant with cytogenetic relapse in 3 patients. In the remission group, all patients invariably tested negative for p190(BCR-ABL); 10 patients tested positive for p210(BCR-ABL) at variable time-points but showed persistent full donor chimerism (DC), whereas 31 patients tested p210(BCR-ABL) negative and displayed full DC or transient MC due to the persistence of recipient T cells. Two patients in the relapse group were successfully reinduced into molecular remission with donor lymphocyte infusion. Sequential molecular analysis after such treatment showed the inverse pattern to that observed prior to relapse, ie, progressive disappearance of p190(BCR-ABL) transcripts, conversion of myeloid chimerism to donor type, and, finally, p210(BCR-ABL) negativity. We conclude that lineage-specific chimerism and p190(BCR-ABL) messenger RNA (mRNA) analyses contribute a better characterization of CML evolution after BMT and enable early identification of patients at the highest risk of relapse.

The Bcr moiety is essential for the transforming activity of the Bcr/Abl oncogene. In search of physiologically relevant Bcr and Bcr/Abl-interacting proteins, we performed an interaction screen in yeast using the entire Bcr protein as bait. We here report that the alpha catalytic subunit of protein kinase CKII strongly and specifically forms a complex with Bcr in yeast in mouse lysates. The region in Bcr responsible for CKIIalpha binding was localized to residues 242-413. CKIIalpha was previously shown to be involved in leukemogenesis and tumorigenesis using different experimental approaches including mouse models. Inhibition of Bcr/Abl P190 in lymphoma cells from Bcr/Abl transgenic mice using imatinib reduced CKIIalpha activity. A highly selective inhibitor of CKIIalpha, 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-2-benzotriazole, inhibited the growth of murine lymphoid cells with induced P210 Bcr/Abl expression and of P190 lymphoma cells. Our results demonstrate that CKIIalpha plays an important role in the proliferation of Bcr/Abl expressing cells, and suggests that inhibitors of CKIIalpha may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of Bcr/Abl-positive leukemia patients.",

These two RNA species were found in all normal tissues or cell lines examined, but at differing concentrations: liver cells had the least, fibroblastic cell lines had the most. By using a probe able to detect the cellular but not the viral gene, the two RNAs were shown to be present in Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed cells at levels found either in their untransformed counterparts or in similar cell types transformed by other means. The target cells of the virus have a somewhat elevated level of the two RNAs although expression of the c-abl gene is not restricted to these cells. The v-abl sequence lacks 0.35 and 0.85 kilobases of the c-abl RNA on the 5' and 3' ends, respectively.

The results showed that the mean detectable rate of bcr/abl fusion gene before and after IFN-alpha therapy was 96.4% and 58.6% respectively, in 22 patients who were bcr/abl-positive before IFN-alpha therapy by D-FISH method, was 94.0% and 70.1% respectively, in 2 patients of Ph-negative before treatment. Major, minor and no responses were seen respectively in 4, 4 and 14 cases from 22 patients by D-FISH method. The results also showed a good correlation with the analysis of RT-PCR and conventional cytogenetics. In conclusion, D-FISH method could directly detect the bcr/abl fusion gene of the interphase cells in bone marrow of patients with CML. It can overcome the defect of conventional cytogenetic methods which analyze only the cells in metaphase and the drawback of RT-PCR unable to quantify the bcr/abl fusion gene. D-FISH provides a more convenient and reliable method for evaluating the degree of clone remission to patients with CML after IFN-alpha therapy.",

Recently, a new multiparametric cell scanning system (Duet) was introduced to the field of MRD detection. This system has the advantage of automatically scanning large numbers of cells and performing combined analysis of morphology and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on the same cell. We used this system to characterize the lineage and degree of maturation of the cells carrying the minor m-BCR/ABL fusion, in a follow-up of an 8-year-old boy with Philadelphia-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The boy was treated using a high-risk protocol and was closely monitored with FISH analysis for cells carrying the m-BCR/ABL fusion. Consecutive analysis along 2.5 years from remission showed 0.2-4.5% m-BCR/ALB(+) cells in the peripheral blood (PB), which is within the accepted background range for this method. The combined analysis found that all the m-BCR/ABL(+) cells were mature lymphocytes. Because mature lymphocytes have a long life span in the circulation, this finding supports the fact that the patient is in remission. Moreover, since mature differentiated cells have a low proliferative capacity, there is a low risk for relapse.",

TA inhibition was also observed in BCR-ABL positive cells resistant to IM at drug concentrations that did not lead to a reduction in BCR-ABL expression. In addition, a reduction in phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated PDK-1 was also detected following IM incubation.;We demonstrate an inhibitory effect of IM on TA and on the AKT/PDK pathway. Because this effect was observed in cell expressing the BCR-ABL protein as well as cells not expressing it, and in cells sensitive as well as resistant to IM, it is reasonable to assume that the inhibitory effect of IM on TA is not mediated through known IM targets.

        "Doc_abstract":"The fundamental basis for immunotherapy of leukemia is that leukemic cells express specific antigens that are not expressed by normal hematopoietic cells. However, the host immune system appears to be tolerant to leukemia cells. To overcome this tolerance, we vaccinated immunocompetent mice with murine leukemia cells (WEHI-3B and BCR-ABL+ 32D cells) transduced with a specifically constructed transmembrane form of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (tmGM-CSF). The transduced cells expressed tmGM-CSF on the cell-surface. To determine whether tmGM-CSF-expressing WEHI-3B leukemia cells would prevent leukemia formation as a vaccine, immunocompetent mice (BALB/c and C3H/HEJ) were immunized with lethally irradiated murine leukemia cells expressing cell-surface tmGM-CSF before challenging mice with murine leukemia cells. Two immunocompetent mouse models were investigated, either WEHI-3B cells in BALB/c mice or BCR-ABL+ 32D cells in C3H/HEJ mouse. The results showed that 100% of WEHI-3B/tmGM-CSF-vaccinated BALB/c mice and about 65% of 32D+ BCR-ABL/tmGM-CSF-vaccinated C3H/HEJ mice were protected from leukemia after leukemia cell challenge, whereas all non-vaccinated mice succumbed to leukemia. Spleen and marrow cell suspensions from vaccinated mice challenged with WEHI-3B cells lacked detectable GFP+ WEHI-3B cells at 82 days post-challenge. A significant delay of death was observed in C3H/HEJ mice challenged with the very aggressive DA-1 cell line expressing BCR-ABL. Vaccination of mice with WEHI-3B/CD40L cells protected 80% of the mice from the WEHI-3B challenge. Notably, 60% of the WEHI-3B/BALB/c mice were also protected from leukemia when WEHI-3B/tmGM-CSF vaccination was carried out after the leukemia challenge. In order to determine whether cellular immunity is involved in this vaccine-mediated protection, either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were depleted from mice after the WEHI-3B/tmGM-CSF vaccination. The results indicate that CD8+ T-cells mediated the protective immune response provided by the irradiated tmGM-CSF-expressing WEHI-3B cells. In addition, vaccination of nude mice did not provide protection from WEHI-3B leukemia induction. Importantly, 80% of non-vaccinated mice were also protected from a WEHI-3B cell challenge after receiving spleen cells from vaccinated mice 1 day before challenge with leukemia cells. These results indicate that overexpression of tmGM-CSF on the leukemia cell-surface can enhance the recognition of leukemic cells by CD8+ T cells, and can either prevent or significantly delay leukemia induction. These findings suggest that injection of irradiated leukemia cells expressing cell-surface-bound GM-CSF has the potential as an immunological approach to treat leukemia.",

In 26 CML patients received allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT) and 4 CML patients treated with imatinib, the expression of bcr-abl mRNA and DNA-PKcs protein was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. After treatment with imatinib in mononuclear cell (MNC) of CML patients and K562 in vitro, expression of DNA-PKcs mRNA was detected by RT-PCR and DNA-PKcs protein level, tyrosine phosphorylation of bcr-abl fusion protein were detected by Western blot. The results showed that the expression of DNA-PKcs protein was significantly lower in CML and K562 than those in normal control (P<0.05). In 26 CML patients received allo-PBSCT and 4 CML patients treated with imatinib, the expression of DNA-PKcs protein was enhanced while the expression of bcr-abl mRNA decreased. After treatment of MNC of CML and K562 with imatinib in vitro, the expression of DNA-PKcs protein was enhanced while tyrosine phosphorylation of bcr-abl fusion protein decreased. It is concluded that the expression of DNA-PKcs protein is down-regulate by bcr-abl fusion gene, and the bcr-abl fusion gene down-regulate the expression of DNA-PKcs protein by post-transcriptional mechanism; the decrease of DNA-PKcs protein expression may be one of mechanisms underlying the acute transformation of CML.",

Therefore, we sought to investigate the applicability of the PAXgene system for bone marrow samples in CML.;Simultaneously stabilized blood and bone marrow samples were obtained from 55 imatinib-resistant CML patients to compare RNA yield and purity, expression of two housekeeping genes (total ABL and beta-glucuronidase; GUS) by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, BCR-ABL expression (ratios BCR-ABL/ABL and BCR-ABL/GUS), and BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations analyzed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing.;RNA extraction revealed high-quality RNA derived from both stabilized blood and bone marrow samples. RNA yield was significantly higher in bone marrow (median 9.9 microg RNA/mL bone marrow) than in blood (median 4.3 microg RNA/mL blood) (p=0.0005). The number of housekeeping gene transcripts was comparable in blood and bone marrow (median ABL copies/2 microL cDNA 13,260 vs. 25,590; median GUS copies/2 microL cDNA 35,490 vs. 60,200; n.s.). Further, ratios BCR-ABL/ABL (blood vs. bone marrow, median 47% vs. 57%) and ratios BCR-ABL/GUS (blood vs. bone marrow, median 26% vs. 21%) were not significantly different.

While imatinib has been extremely effective for chronic phase CML, blast crisis CML and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are often resistant. In particular, mutation of the T315 residue in the bcr/abl activation loop renders cells highly resistant to imatinib and to second-generation kinase inhibitors such as BMS-354825 or AMN107. Adaphostin is a tyrphostin that was originally intended to inhibit the BCR/ABL kinase by competing with its peptide substrates. Recent findings have in addition implicated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cytotoxic mechanism of adaphostin. In view of this unique mode of action, we examined the effects of adaphostin on numerous imatinib-resistant leukemia models, including imatinib-resistant CML and Ph+ ALL cell lines, cells harboring point mutations in BCR/ABL, and specimens from imatinib-resistant CML patients, using assays for intracellular ROS, apoptosis, and clonogenicity. Every model of imatinib resistance examined remained fully sensitive to adaphostin-induced cell death. Collectively, these data suggest that ROS generation by adaphostin overcomes even the most potent imatinib resistance in CML and Ph+ ALL.",

The environment in which the leukemia cells are present during the drug treatment is known to provide significant survival benefit. Here, we have modeled this process by culturing murine Bcr/Abl-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells in the presence of stroma while treating them with a moderate dose of two unrelated drugs, the farnesyltransferase inhibitor lonafarnib and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib. This results in an initial large reduction in cell viability of the culture and inhibition of cell proliferation. However, after a number of days, cell death ceases and the culture becomes drug-tolerant, enabling cell division to resume. Using gene expression profiling, we found that the development of drug resistance was accompanied by massive transcriptional upregulation of genes that are associated with general inflammatory responses such as the metalloproteinase MMP9. MMP9 protein levels and enzymatic activity were also increased in ALL cells that had become nilotinib-tolerant. Activation of p38, Akt and Erk correlated with the development of environment-mediated drug resistance (EMDR), and inhibitors of Akt and Erk in combination with nilotinib reduced the ability of the cells to develop resistance. However, inhibition of p38 promoted increased resistance to nilotinib. We conclude that development of EMDR by ALL cells involves changes in numerous intracellular pathways. Development of tolerance to drugs such as nilotinib may therefore be circumvented by simultaneous treatment with other drugs having divergent targets.",

Key to eradicating LSCs is to identify genes that play a critical role in survival regulation of these stem cells. Using BCR-ABL-induced CML mouse model, here we show that expression of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1) gene is downregulated in LSCs and that Scd1 plays a tumor-suppressive role in LSCs with no effect on the function of normal hematopoietic stem cells. Deletion of Scd1 causes acceleration of CML development and conversely overexpression of Scd1 delays CML development. In addition, using genetic approaches, we show that Pten, p53, and Bcl2 are regulated by Scd1 in LSCs. Furthermore, we find that induction of Scd1 expression by a PPARγ agonist suppresses LSCs and delays CML development. Our results demonstrate a critical role for Scd1 in functional regulation of LSCs, providing a new anti-LSC strategy through enhancing Scd1 activity.",

Now, one major focus is to further explore its potential therapeutic use. From the mechanism, it becomes clear that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) play a pivotal role in triggering RNAi. This chapter describes the in vivo application of targeted non-virally delivered synthetic bcr-abl siRNA in a female patient with recurrent Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) resistant to imatinib (Y253F mutation) and chemotherapy after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A remarkable inhibition of the overexpressed bcr-abl oncogene resulting in increased apoptosis of CML cells was found. In vivo siRNA application was well tolerated without any clinically adverse events. The current findings imply that the clinical application of synthetic siRNA is feasible and safe and has real potential for genetic-based therapies using synthetic non-viral carriers. ",

Differentiation therapy is considered to be a new strategy for treating this type of leukemia. Aclacinomycin A (ACM) is an antitumor antibiotic. Previous studies have shown that ACM induced erythroid differentiation of CML cells. In this study, we investigate the effect of ACM on the sensitivity of human CML cell line K562 to Bcr-Abl specific inhibitor imatinib (STI571, Gleevec). We first determined the optimal concentration of ACM for erythroid differentiation but not growth inhibition and apoptosis in K562 cells. Then, pretreatment with this optimal concentration of ACM followed by a minimally toxic concentration of imatinib strongly induced growth inhibition and apoptosis compared to that with simultaneous co-treatment, indicating that ACM-induced erythroid differentiation sensitizes K562 cells to imatinib. Sequential treatment with ACM and imatinib induced Bcr-Abl down-regulation, cytochrome c release into the cytosol, and caspase-3 activation, as well as decreased Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL expressions, but did not affect Fas ligand/Fas death receptor and procaspase-8 expressions. ACM/imatinib sequential treatment-induced apoptosis was suppressed by a caspase-9 inhibitor and a caspase-3 inhibitor, indicating that the caspase cascade is involved in this apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ACM induced erythroid differentiation through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The inhibition of erythroid differentiation by p38MAPK inhibitor SB202190, p38MAPK dominant negative mutant or p38MAPK shRNA knockdown, reduced the ACM/imatinib sequential treatment-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis. These results suggest that differentiated K562 cells induced by ACM-mediated p38MAPK pathway become more sensitive to imatinib and result in down-regulations of Bcr-Abl and anti-apoptotic proteins, growth inhibition and apoptosis. These results provided a potential management by which ACM might have a crucial impact on increasing sensitivity of CML cells to imatinib in the differentiation therapeutic approaches.",

Reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, results into Bcr-Abl fusion and is responsible for expression of a tyrosine kinase protein p210(bcr/abl), which mediates several survival pathways and confer therapeutic resistance. Protein kinase C (PKC), a family of serine threonine kinases play an important role in the process of leukemogenesis. A crosstalk between Bcr-Abl and PKC signaling has been documented. Therefore, targeting p210(bcr/abl) and its associated signaling proteins using non-toxic natural means will be an effective strategy for antileukemic therapy. Aim of the present study is to investigate whether PEITC, a natural isothiocyanate in combination with imatinib mesylate (IM), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor could increase the therapeutic efficacy of IM by modulating the expression of p210(bcr/abl). Enhanced cytotoxic efficacy of IM by PEITC was further validated using another myelogenous leukemia cell line, KU812. It was observed that PEITC in combination with IM efficiently downregulated the expression of p210(bcr/abl) in chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines (K-562). PEITC inhibited the expressions of PKCα, PKCβII and PKCζ (both phosphorylated and total form). Expression of Raf1 and ERK1/2, two important target proteins in PKC signaling cascade was diminished. The result indicated that PEITC ultimately reduced expression of Raf1 and ERK1/2 through Bcr-Abl and PKC inhibition. This result was further confirmed by UCN-01, a selective PKC inhibitor and IM; indicating an association between p210(bcr/abl) and PKC with Raf1 and ERK1/2. PEITC thus may have enormous potential in synergistic therapy of leukemia by enhancing drug efficacy. ",

In this study, we have constructed an expression cDNA library from the leukemia cells of a patient with CML and used the autologous serum to screen for high-titer IgG antibodies directed at the leukemia-derived proteins. We isolated eight distinct clones from the library, suggesting that multiple immune responses were elicited in the autologous host. Sequence analysis showed high degrees of homology to known gene sequences in six of the eight clones. Neither bcr-abl nor proteinase 3 sequences were isolated. Using Northern blot analysis, seven of the eight clones showed ubiquitous expression in normal bone marrow, leukemia cell lines, fresh leukemia cells, and normal tissues. However, clone no. 4 showed restricted mRNA expression, being only detected in some fresh leukemia cells, K562 cells, and normal testicular RNA. Using bacterial lysates in dot blot analysis, a panel of sera from normal individuals and patients with CML and other hematological malignancies were screened for high-titer antibodies against these eight clones. There were, among the CML patients, signficantly higher prevalence of antibodies against seven of the eight clones. They were observed even after omitting from the analysis patients with multiple myeloma whose associated immune paresis may impair immune responses to these proteins. Interestingly, antibodies against these proteins were also detected in a small number of normal individuals. Although the precise clinical significance of our findings remains to be determined, this study provides evidence in support of the potential immunogenicity of leukemia-derived proteins in the autologous host. It also provides basis for further investigations to characterize these proteins, especially clone no. 4, and determine their potential for immune targeting in CML.",

Therefore, the efficacy of treatment in Ph+ ALL is still to be determined. In this study, we focused our attention on the potential benefit of rapamycin (RAPA), an mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, in combination with IM on a Ph+ ALL cell line SUP-B15 and a primary Ph+ ALL sample in vitro. Analysis of cell proliferation showed that RAPA (50 nm) plus IM exerted good synergistic effect on Ph+ ALL cells. Notably, we found that IM treatment induced the abnormal activation of the components of mTOR signaling pathway and p-BCR-ABL, whereas RAPA potently eliminated this deleterious side effect induced by IM and might overcome the resistance to IM. The synergistic effect was also associated with the increase in autophagy, which seemed to have an opposite role with apoptosis in Ph+ ALL cells, and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Altogether, our results suggested that IM in combination with RAPA was more effective for Ph+ ALL cells than IM alone. ",

The suppressive role of naturally occurring T regulatory (T-reg) cells in antitumor immunity is well-established, although little is known about their role in modulating the T-cell response to BCR-ABL.;Naturally occurring T-reg cells were characterized and quantified by flow cytometry in 39 CML patients and 10 healthy donors. Their function was studied by observing their effect on responses to purified protein derivative, a recall antigen, and on the response of an autologous T-cell line recognizing BCR-ABL.;T-reg cells were CD4(+), CD25(+), FOXP3(+), CD127(low), and CD62L(high). T-reg numbers in patients in complete cytogenetic remission were significantly lower than in patients not in complete cytogenetic remission (p < 0.01).

Furthermore, the interferon-γ and/or granzyme-B production of effector cells specific for viral peptides or a BCR-ABL HLA-A3-restricted peptide was inhibited when autologous T-reg cells were present.;Taken together, these data suggest a role for T-reg cells in limiting immune responses in CML patients and this may include immune responses to BCR-ABL.

Expression of Ikaros and Helios isoforms in a total of 163 patients with leukemia and correlations between Ikaros and Helios isoforms were analyzed by PCR. The results showed that different expression patters of Ikaros and Helios isoforms existed in leukemia patients, that is, Ikaros isoform (Ik-6) was predominantly expressed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with BCR/ABL fusion gene, while Helios isoform (He-i) was overexpressed in T-cell ALL patients. The results of cloning and sequencing demonstrated that the isoforms of Ikaros and Helios had different genetic alterations. The statistical correlation between these two isoforms not was found in this study, although interaction between Ikaros and Helios has been reported. It is concluded that although Ikaros and Helios belong to the same family with similar structure of zinc fingers, their isoforms have different expression profile, specific genetic alterations, and different clinical relevance in patients with leukemia. The connection and interaction between Ik-6 and He-i needs further research.",

In this prospective study, samples from 478 patients with CD10(+) B-cell precursor ALL (c-ALL and pre-B ALL) underwent BCR-ABL reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis with double testing of positive samples. Patients were stratified according to the PCR result and treated in 2 German Multicenter Trials of Adult ALL. The outcome was followed and the prognostic impact of BCR-ABL was compared to clinical risk features. Of the 478 samples, 432 had an evaluable BCR-ABL result. Thirty-seven percent of the c-ALL and pre-B ALL patients were BCR-ABL(+) (p190, 77%; p210, 20%; simultaneous p190/p210, 3%). BCR-ABL positivity was associated with the high-risk features of older age (45 years versus 30 years median age; P =.0001) and higher white blood cell counts (23 500/microL versus 11 550/microL; P =.0001). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed BCR-ABL as the leading factor for a poor prognosis (P =.0001) in comparison to clinical risk criteria. Irrespective of the breakpoint, presence of any BCR-ABL transcript predicted a lower chance of initial treatment response (68.4% versus 84.6%; P =.001) and a lower probability of disease-free survival at 3 years (0.13 versus 0.47; P =.0001). This bad outcome was not influenced by postinduction high-dose treatment stratifications. The results show a high prevalence of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts with predominance of p190. BCR-ABL RT-PCR is confirmed as a sensitive, rapid method to diagnose t(9;22), and p190 and p210 are unequivocally demonstrated as the most important predictors of poor long-term survival despite intensified chemotherapy.",

The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is the standard treatment for Ph+ leukemia and plays efficacious role in CML. However, imatinib has few inhibitory effects on SRC tyrosine kinase with response rate of Ph+ ALL lower and relapse more frequent and quicker compared with CML. Previous studies showed that oridonin inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in many tumor cells. However, the anticancer activity and mechanism of oridonin in Ph+ ALL is unknown. To investigate the anticancer activity of oridonin, we examined its role in constitutively activated Akt/mTOR, Raf/MEK/ERK, STAT5 and SRC pathway, mRNA level of bcr/abl gene, cell viability and apoptosis in Ph+ ALL SUP-B15 cells. Furthermore, we detected synergetic effect of oridonin plus imatinib. Our results showed that oridonin inhibiting activations of LYN (one of SRC family kinases) and ABL and their downstream Akt/mTOR, Raf/MEK/ERK and STAT5 pathways, downregulated Bcl-2 but upregulated Bax protein and then induced apoptosis in Ph+ ALL cells. Oridonin plus imatinib exerted synergetic effects by overcoming imatinib defect of upregulating Akt/mTOR and LYN signaling. Additionally, we examined the effect of oridonin on the signaling pathways in the primary specimens from Ph+ ALL patients. Our data showed that oridonin remarkably suppressed activations of Akt/mTOR, Raf/MEK and STAT5 pathway in these primary specimens and oridonin with imatinib exerted synergetic suppressive effects on mTOR, STAT5 and LYN signaling in one imatinib resistant patient specimen. Additional evaluation of oridonin as a potential therapeutic agent for Ph+ ALL seems warranted.",

It accounts for over one-third of all childhood cancers, most of which (approximately 75%) are acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Over a decade, a total of 128 cases of childhood acute leukemia have been diagnosed and managed at Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Unit, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, which is the national referral center of pediatric leukemia cases. A retrospective review of case notes was used to study all children with a diagnosis of acute leukemia from January 1993 to January 2003. All the cases were diagnosed using a bone marrow aspirate with morphological and immunophenotypic classification. Over this period, 24 cases relapsed. They were classified as per BFM group as \"very early,\" \"early,\" and \"late\" according to the time from diagnosis to first relapse and were divided into isolated bone marrow (BM), extramedullary site, and combined relapse. Sixteen percent of ALL cases and 58.6% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases so far relapsed. Most of the AML cases relapsed very early on in treatment. Eleven patients had combined relapse in BM and extramedullary site (9 in the central nervous system, 1 in the testicles, and 1 in the eye). The overall outcome of these patients is very poor, and only 6 patients out of 24 are still alive. In conclusion, the relapse rates of childhood AL are more or less similar to those of other reports but the overall outcome is very poor. A large majority of the patients in this study are either very early or early relapsers. Future studies including genetic and molecular analysis may be able to explain the difference in clinical outcome of these relapsed AL cases.",

We review such models in light of relevant findings from radiobiology, emphasizing 3 points. First, the CML models almost all assert that the latency time, from CML initiation to diagnosis, is at most ∼10 years. Meanwhile, current radiobiologic estimates, based on Japanese atomic bomb survivor data, indicate a substantially higher maximum, suggesting longer-term relapses and extra resistance mutations. Second, different CML models assume different numbers, between 400 and 10(6), of normal HSCs. Radiobiologic estimates favor values>10(6) for the number of normal cells (often assumed to be the HSCs) that are at risk for a CML-initiating BCR-ABL translocation. Moreover, there is some evidence for an HSC dead-band hypothesis, consistent with HSC numbers being very different across different healthy adults. Third, radiobiologists have found that sporadic (background, age-driven) chromosome translocation incidence increases with age during adulthood. BCR-ABL translocation incidence increasing with age would provide a hitherto underanalyzed contribution to observed background adult-onset CML incidence acceleration with age, and would cast some doubt on stage-number inferences from multistage carcinogenesis models in general.",

In the current study, we present two unusual cases of CML selected from a series of 54 consecutive cases. A detailed study using classical cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was done using dual color extra signal FISH and whole chromosome paint in order to elucidate the mechanism of 9q deletion. One case had two clones on interphase FISH, one with and one without chromosome 9q deletion. The other case had two clones on both cytogenetic and FISH analyses, one with and one without a marker chromosome carrying chromosome 9q sequences. In this latter case, the clone with deletion of the derivative chromosome 9 comprised 21.1% at diagnosis, increasing to 36.8% after 11 months, suggesting a growth advantage.

        "Doc_abstract":"Mounting evidence indicates that human cancers may originate from malignant transformation of stem cells. The most convincing proof is found in acute myeloid leukemia, where only a small subset of slowly dividing cells was able to induce transplantable acute myeloid leukemia. Normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are characterized by their unlimited ability to self-renew, give rise to a multitude of cells that exhibit more differentiated features, and show slow division kinetics. Using human HSC and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) as models, we and others have demonstrated the vital role of the cellular niche in maintaining the self-renewing capacity, that is, \"stemness\" of HSC. Without direct contact with the cellular niche, HSC tend to differentiate and lose their stemness. Similar to their normal counterparts, leukemia stem cells divide slowly and maintain their self-renewal capacity through interaction with the niche. As a consequence, they are resistant to conventional chemotherapy strategies that target rapidly dividing cells. Thus it is of utmost importance to understand the interaction between cellular niche and normal HSC as well as between leukemia stem cells and the niche to provide a basis for more efficient treatment strategies.",

In this study, we performed a prospective, sequential analysis using RT-qPCR monitoring of BCR-ABL gene rearrangements in blood samples from 91 CML patients in chronic phase (CP) who achieved complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) and major molecular remission (MMR) throughout imatinib treatment.;The absolute level of BCR-ABL transcript from peripheral blood was serially measured every 4 to 12 weeks by RT-qPCR. Only level variations > 0.5%, according to the international scale, was considered positive. Sequential cytogenetic analysis was also performed in bone marrow samples from all patients using standard protocols.;Based on sequential analysis of BCR-ABL transcripts, the 91 patients were divided into three categories: (A) 57 (62.6%) had no variation on sequential analysis; (B) 30 (32.9%) had a single positive variation result obtained in a single sample; and (C) 4 (4.39%) had variations of BCR-ABL transcripts in at least two consecutive samples. Of the 34 patients who had elevated levels of transcripts (group B and C), 19 (55.8%) had a < 1% of BCR-ABL/BCR ratio, 13 (38.2%) patients had a 1% to 10% increase and 2 patients had a >10% increase of RT-qPCR. The last two patients had lost a CCyR, and none of them showed mutations in the ABL gene. Transient cytogenetic alterations in Ph-negative cells were observed in five (5.5%) patients, and none of whom lost CCyR.;Despite an increase levels of BCR-ABL/BCR ratio variations by RT-qPCR, the majority of CML patients with MMR remained in CCyR. Thus, such single variations should neither be considered predictive of subsequent failure and nor an indication for altering imatinib dose or switching to second generation therapy. Changing of imatinib on the basis of BCR-ABL/BCR% sustained increase and mutational studies is a prudent approach for preserving other therapeutic options in imatinib-resistant patients.",

After clinical history, cytogenetics, and molecular tests, patients were diagnosed with either clonal or nonclonal hematologic diseases. CALR screening was primarily performed using fragment analysis polymerase chain reaction, then next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing.;Among the 18 patients diagnosed with clonal diseases, one had acute myeloid leukemia (positive for trisomy 8), and 17 had myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and polycythemia vera (PV). Patients with CML were positive for the BCR-ABL1 fusion. Ten patients were positive for JAK2 (PMF, n = 1; ET, n = 2; PV, n = 7), and three were CALR positive (ET, n = 1; PMF, n = 2). Patients diagnosed with a nonclonal disease were negative for JAK2, BCR-ABL, and CALR mutations.;Screening for CALR mutations is essential in BCR-ABL-negative MPNs since it not only provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information but also identifies potential treatment targets.

The translocation (9;22) in CML-N results in the transcription of an e19/a2 type BCR/ABL mRNA that codes for a 230-kD BCR/ABL protein (p230). The indolence of the clinical course of patients with CML-N has been disputed.;The objectives of this study were to quantify and correlate with clinical outcome the p230 mRNA and protein in patients with CML-N, to describe six new patients and the follow-up (with molecular analysis) of five previously reported patients with CML-N, and to review characteristics of all patients with CML-N and p230 BCR/ABL reported to date in the literature.;Quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays on specimens from the great majority of patients with CML-N revealed minimal numbers of molecules of p230 BCR/ABL transcripts per total RNA. This also was associated with a lack of detectable p230 BCR/ABL protein in patient specimens, even in one patient who was followed for 16 years after diagnosis. This may explain the milder leukemic phenotype in most patients with CML-N. A review of all 23 patients who had an e19/a2 type BCR/ABL translocation suggested that the low level of p230 BCR/ABL mRNA and the lack of detectable p230 BCR/ABL protein in patients with no additional cytogenetic abnormalities may predict their indolent clinical course.;Patients with p230 positive CML-N have indolent course, probably as a result of low p230 mRNA and protein levels. This supports the need to conduct additional molecular studies, even if cytogenetic studies have revealed t(9;22), because of the prognostic importance of the molecular findings.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Recent advances in molecular cytogenetics of leukemia is reported with special reference to the pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, and potential gene therapy. Regarding leukemogenesis, we found that neocarzinostatin induced a variety of deletions and reciprocal translocations. Among these random chromosome abnormalities, two reciprocal translocations which were specific for certain leukemias could be observed; t(11;14)(q13;q32) and t(7;11)(p15p13). This fact suggests that a translocation carrying oncogene rearrangement may be of potential relevance to the leukemogenesis. The success in making a subgroup (FAB classification) identified a number of subtype-specific translocations in leukemias. It has been suggested that an initiation or progression-associated event is mediated through a gross chromosomal change. The molecular characterization of chromosomal rearrangement leads to the identification of genes involved in leukemia. Our recent works in molecular cytogenetics of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), FAB-M3 and -M4 were shown in this article. Since rearrangement of relevant genes were cloned, PCR made it feasible to detect minimal residual disease at 10(-6) level after intensive treatment or bone marrow transplantation for CML, Ph-positive ALL, M3 and approximately half of childhood leukemia. Recently developed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using specific probes can visualize certain chromosomes or chromosomal segments. Ph translocation, for instance, is now demonstrated as three spot-signals in interphase nuclei using YAC (yeast artificial chromosome)-BCR clone. Lastly, the use of antisense oligonucleotides for the BCR-ABL junctions should result in the inhibition of growth of CML clone. The strategy using antisense molecules may be very powerful tool in the gene-targeting therapy for human neoplasms.",

To determine the prognostic significance of early Bcr-Abl levels and changes in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM), serial samples of 56 patients with relapsed or refractory Ph(+) ALL treated in phase 2 trials of imatinib were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

In BM, the decline of median Bcr-Abl/GAPDH was 0.75, 1.37, and 2.78 logs, respectively. Thus, Bcr-Abl levels decreased more rapidly in PB than in BM (median time to best level 31 vs 39 days).

Engagement of surface immunoglobulin by antigen is a key driver of malignant cells with outcome influenced by the nature of the cell, the level of stimulation and the microenvironment. Analysis of surface immunoglobulin-mediated signaling in the two major disease subsets defined by IGHV mutational status reveals bifurcation of responses toward proliferation or anergy. Mutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia, generally of relatively good prognosis, is mainly, but not exclusively, driven towards anergy in vivo. In contrast, unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia shows less evidence for anergy in vivo retaining more responsiveness to surface immunoglobulin M-mediated signaling, possibly explaining increased tumor progression. Expression and function of surface immunoglobulin M in unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia appear rather homogeneous, but mutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia exhibits a highly heterogeneous profile that may relate to further variable clinical behavior within this subset. Anergy should increase susceptibility to apoptosis but, in leukemic cells, this may be countered by overexpression of the B-cell lymphoma-2 survival protein. Maintained anergy spreads to chemokines and adhesion molecules, restraining homing and migration. However, anergy is not necessarily completely benign, being able to reverse and regenerate surface immunoglobulin M-mediated responses. A two-pronged attack on proliferative and anti-apoptotic pathways may succeed. Increased understanding of how chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells are driven to anergy or proliferation should reveal predictive biomarkers of progression and of likely response to kinase inhibitors, which could assist therapeutic decisions.

We modeled three types of mutations involved in this progression: mutations that result in myeloid progenitor cells proliferating independently of external growth factors; mutations causing failure of myeloid progenitor cells to differentiate; and mutations that enable these cells to survive independently of attachment to marrow stroma. We further modeled tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) as restoring myeloid cell apoptosis and preventing ROS-driven mutagenesis, and mutations that cause TKI resistance.

Our results show that for the detection of bcr/abl translocation in CML patients, FISH is more sensitive than conventional cytogenetics because it detects significantly higher proportions of cells carrying the translocation both in metaphase (P < .0002) and interphase nuclei (P < .003). Moreover, in the metaphases of the controls analyzed, no bcr/abl+ chromosome was detected that makes the colocalization of bcr and abl signals in the CML patients highly specific.

In this study, we investigated the prognostic significance of leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) as assessment of index of MRD in 125 adult B-lineage ALL (B-ALL) patients by eight-color flow cytometry. The LAIPs could be identified in 96% and 81.6% of patients with the sensitivity of 10(-4) and 10(-5), respectively. MRD-negative status could clearly predict a favorable 2-year relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) at the end of induction of complete remission and one cycle of consolidation treatment. Moreover, we identified a group of cases with MRD of 0.001% to <0.01%, which showed significantly higher 2-year relapse rate than those with undetectable one. In multivariate analysis, MRD status was associated with RFS or OS independently. Furthermore, MRD assessed by LAIPs and RQ-PCR assay for patients with BCR-ABL fusion gene yielded concordant results in 89.7% of cases. In conclusion, MRD evaluated by eight-color flow cytometry could provide an important tool to assess treatment response and prognosis precisely in adult B-ALL. ",

A cohort of 72 patients with CML in myeloid blast crisis (BC) (n = 34), lymphoid BC (n = 2), accelerated phase (AP) (n = 16), CP (n = 18), and BCR-ABL(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 2) resistant to imatinib were investigated. Median levels of BCR-ABL transcripts, determined by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), were not significantly changed at the time of resistance, but seven of 55 patients showed a greater than 10-fold increase in BCR-ABL levels. Genomic amplification of BCR-ABL was found in two of 32 patients evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Additional chromosomal aberrations were observed in 19 of 36 patients and point mutations of the ABL tyrosine kinase domain resulting in reactivation of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase were detected in 29 of 72 patients. Resistance may be caused by BCR-ABL-independent or BCR-ABL-dependent mechanisms. A thorough evaluation of resistant cases is required to suggest therapeutic measures in the individual case. Clonal selection of resistant cells harboring a BCR-ABL mutation might be reversed by stopping imatinib therapy and switching to chemotherapy.

Similar interactions were observed in Bcr/Abl(+) LAMA-84 cells but not in leukemic cells that fail to express Bcr/Abl (e.g., HL-60, U937, Jurkat). STI571/flavopiridol-mediated apoptosis was associated with the caspase-independent down-regulation of Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, and the caspase-dependent release of Smac/DIABLO and loss of deltapsi(m). Coadministration of flavopiridol and STI571 did not result in changes in levels of expression of Bcl-2, phopho-Stat5, phospho-p34(cdc2), or Bcr/Abl. Finally, STI571/flavopiridol effectively induced apoptosis in STI571-resistant K562 cells displaying amplification of the Bcr/Abl protein.;Together, these findings indicate that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol induces multiple perturbations in signaling pathways in STI571-treated Bcr/Abl(+) human leukemia cells that culminate in mitochondrial injury, caspase activation, and apoptosis. They also suggest that simultaneous disruption of survival signaling and cell cycle regulatory pathways may represent an effective strategy in Bcr/Abl(+) malignancies.",

Therefore, we assessed the variability of quantitative results obtained from 4 different laboratories in Japan, including 3 companies and Tohoku University Hospital, using identical peripheral blood or bone marrow samples of patients in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; n = 11) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 2). RQ-PCR was designed to quantify the copy numbers of disease-specific fusion chimeras; BCR-ABL (CML) and AML1-ETO (AML). In 5 out of 13 samples, the quantitative results from 4 laboratories varied more than 10 times (up to 712 times). Thus, we next sought to determine factors affecting the variability of RQ-PCR results across laboratories, by sending back RNA and cDNA samples from each company to Tohoku University, and they were further proceed to yield quantitative data. The main difference between companies and Tohoku University was probably due to the difference of blood separation method (Blood lysis or Ficoll-Hypaque). On the other hand, the variability among 4 laboratories was the most noticeable in the PCR step, mainly attributable to the difference of primer/probe sequence among laboratories.

Nevertheless, imatinib resistance has raised concern and prompted interest in additional strategies to achieve disease eradication. Resistance to imatinib is mainly associated with three mechanisms: acquired mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL protein, genetic amplification, and transcript overexpression of BCR-ABL rearrangement. Therefore an accurate assessment of resistance mechanism is particularly important to improve strategies to overcome resistance. In order to determine overexpression of BCR-ABL, we propose a method that correlates quantitative real time PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization data from the same peripheral blood sample. The ratio between both methodologies permits to calculate the expression index (EI) for each patient. EI estimates the rate of BCR-ABL transcription per rearrangement. The median EI value, including all cases (n = 123), was 0.288; those cases (n = 13) included in percentile 90 showed an increment of EI above 1 Log (>2.88) with respect to the median value and were considered as cases with overexpression. We also evaluated the EIs using receiver operating characteristics curve; choosing an EI cutoff of 1.836 we obtained a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 61%. Using this EI cutoff value, more patients (n = 17) were included in the overexpression group.

To elucidate some of the structural requirements and functional consequences of the association of Bcr-Abl with Hck, their interaction was investigated in transiently transfected COS7 cells. Neither the complex formation of Hck kinase with Bcr-Abl nor the activation of Hck by Bcr-Abl was dependent on the Abl kinase activity. Both inactivating point mutations of Hck and dephosphorylation of Hck enhanced its complex formation with Bcr-Abl, indicating that their physical interaction was negatively regulated by Hck (auto)phosphorylation. Finally, experiments with a series of kinase negative Bcr-Abl mutants showed that Hck phosphorylated Bcr-Abl and induced the binding of Grb2 to Tyr177 of Bcr-Abl. Taken together, our results suggest that Bcr-Abl preferentially binds inactive forms of Hck by an Abl kinase-independent mechanism.

The most common karyotypic change that occurs as CML evolves from chronic phase to blast crisis is the development of multiple Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosomes, each of which is presumably harboring a translocated c-abl oncogene. We describe here a patient with CML who presented in lymphoid blast crisis with three Ph1 chromosomes/metaphase associated with an amplified, rearranged c-abl oncogene fragment and high levels of the aberrant 8-kilobase bcr-abl transcript. This rearranged c-abl fragment was amplified to a similar degree in both the patient's blast crisis cells and in his terminally differentiated granulocytes, but the level of the aberrant CML-specific bcr-abl transcript was some eight- to 16-fold higher in the blast crisis cells v the granulocytes. This analysis indicates that genomic amplification of a translocated c-abl oncogene, although perhaps important in the evolution of CML, nevertheless cannot, by itself, be the sole genetic event giving rise to blast crisis.",

The results indicated that fgfr3 gene could be detected in both K562 and U937 cell lines, but not in HL-60 and SHI-1 cell lines. The positive expression rates of fgfr3 mRNA in AL and CML were 46.15% and 51.61% respectively, and were higher than that in control (14.29%, p < 0.05). The positive expression rates of fgfr3 mRNA in AML and ALL were 44.44% and 48.28% respectively, and were higher than that in control (p < 0.05). The increased level of fgfr3 mRNA had a positive correlation with high white blood cell count of > or = 20 x 10(9)/L (p < 0.05). Higher fgfr3 mRNA expression positively correlated with fuse genes of bcr/abl in ALL (r = 0.151, p < 0.05). The expression of fgfr3 gene in AL was not related with chromosome abnormality.

Thus, the screening of umbilical cord blood (UCB) for PGF may be of high importance for developing strategies for childhood leukemia prevention and treatment. However, the data on incidence of PGF in UCB are contradictive. We have compared multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time quantitative PCR (RT qPCR) in neonates from Slovak National Birth Cohort. According to multiplex PCR, all 135 screened samples were negative for the most frequent PGF of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To explore the prevalence of prognostically important TEL-AML1, MLL-AF4 and BCR-ABL (p190), 200 UCB were screened using RT qPCR. The initial screening showed an unexpectedly high incidence of studied PGF. The validation of selected samples in two laboratories confirmed approximately ¼ of UCB positive, resulting in ∼4% incidence of TEL-AML1, ∼6.25% incidence of BCR-ABL1 p190, and ∼0.75% frequency of MLL-AF4. In most cases, the PGF presented at very low level, about 1-5 copies per 105 cells. We hypothesize that low PGF numbers reflect their relatively late origin and are likely to be eliminated in further development while higher number of PGF reflects earlier origination and may represent higher risk for leukemia.

Therefore, dual fusion probes that created a fusion signal on the derivative chromosome 9 in addition to the fusion sifnal on the Philadelphia chromosome or derivative chromosome 22 were developed. Using these second-generation probes, it was discovered that a significant proportion of CML cases has a sub-microscopic deletion at the site of the ABL-BCR fusion.

The OCT-1 activity in mononuclear cells reflects the efficiency of active influx of imatinib. OCT-1 activity in mononuclear cells is highly variable between patients and significantly correlates with a patient's molecular response to imatinib treatment and overall survival. The present study examined whether cell lineage and BCR-ABL expression influenced OCT-1 activity.;The OCT-1 activity and OCT-1 mRNA expression was assessed in pure populations of neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes recovered from chronic myeloid leukemia patients at diagnosis, in cytogenetic remission and normal individuals. The role of BCR-ABL on OCT-1 activity and differentiation was examined in a cell line model of ectopic BCR-ABL expression.;The OCT-1 activity and OCT-1 mRNA expression was highest in the neutrophil population and lowest in lymphocytes (P<0.05). This was observed for patients at diagnosis, in cytogenetic remission and normal individuals. Interestingly, neutrophil OCT-1 activity was not significantly different between patients at diagnosis, in remission and normal donors. This was also observed for monocytes and lymphocytes. Furthermore, OCT-1 activity in mononuclear cells was significantly correlated with the OCT-1 activity in neutrophils (P=0.001). In a cell line model in which BCR-ABL was ectopically expressed, we found no evidence that BCR-ABL directly affected OCT-1 expression and function. However, BCR-ABL stimulated granulocyte differentiation which, in turn, led to significantly increased OCT-1 activity (P=0.024).;These studies suggest that the predictive OCT-1 activity in patient mononuclear cells is strongly related to cell lineage, particularly the presence of neutrophils in the peripheral blood.

Mice bearing high leukemic burdens (simulating human Ph(+) ALL at diagnosis) entered remission on maximally intensive, twice-daily dasatinib therapy, but invariably relapsed with disseminated and/or central nervous system disease.

Fusion genes involving ABL, ARG, PDGFRs, JAK2, SYK, TRKC, and FGFRs, and gain-of-function mutations of FLT3, KIT and JAK2 have been detected at various rates in myeloproliferative disease and acute myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, abnormal overexpression of tyrosine kinases such as FLT3 has also been reported. These gene products are constitutively activated and potentially transform hematopoietic cells by augmentation of proliferation and enhanced viability. Since the fusion or mutation of tyrosine kinase is a primary and central event in chronic myeloproliferative diseases, targeting the kinase activity has been thought to be an ideal intervention to treat these diseases. The clinical success of imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia has made this idea a reality, and has accelerated the development of new tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Challenging studies with TKIs have also been reported for acute myeloid leukemia. This review will focus on recent trials of TKIs against oncogenic tyrosine kinases (ABL, PDGFRs, FLT3 and KIT) in myeloid malignancies.",

In the present study, we identified a unique subpopulation of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells coexpressing markers of endothelial cells (including VE-cadherin, PECAM-1, and Flk-1) and committed B-lineage progenitors. After long-term coculture with bone marrow stromal cells, tumor cells formed hematopoietic colonies and cords, expressed early stem- cell markers, and showed endothelial sprouting. Gene expression profiles of LSCs were altered in the presence of stromal cell contact. Stromal cell contact promoted leukemic cell VE-cadherin expression, stabilized beta-catenin, and up-regulated Bcr-abl fusion gene expression. Our study indicates that these specific tumor cells are uniquely positioned to respond to microenvironment-derived self-renewing and proliferative cues. Ph(+)/VE-cadherin(+) tumor subpopulation circumvents the requirement of exogenous Wnt signaling for self-renewal through stromal cell support of leukemic cell VE-cadherin expression and up-regulated Bcr-abl tyrosine kinase activity. These data suggest that strategies targeting signals in the marrow microenvironment that amplify the Bcr-abl/VE-cadherin/beta-catenin axis may have utility in sensitizing drug-resistant leukemic stem cells.",

However, early relapses and the emergence of imatinib-resistant disease are problematic. Evidence suggests that imatinib and other inhibitors may not effectively eradicate leukemic stem/progenitor cells, and that combination therapy directed to complimentary targets may improve treatment. Abelson helper integration site 1 (Ahi-1)/AHI-1 is a novel oncogene that is highly deregulated in CML stem/progenitor cells where levels of BCR-ABL transcripts are also elevated. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of Ahi-1/AHI-1 in murine and human hematopoietic cells confer growth advantages in vitro and induce leukemia in vivo, enhancing effects of BCR-ABL. Conversely, RNAi-mediated suppression of AHI-1 in BCR-ABL-transduced lin(-)CD34(+) human cord blood cells and primary CML stem/progenitor cells reduces their growth autonomy in vitro. Interestingly, coexpression of Ahi-1 in BCR-ABL-inducible cells reverses growth deficiencies exhibited by BCR-ABL down-regulation and is associated with sustained phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and enhanced activation of JAK2-STAT5. Moreover, we identified an AHI-1-BCR-ABL-JAK2 interaction complex and found that modulation of AHI-1 expression regulates phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and JAK2-STAT5 in CML cells. Importantly, this complex mediates TKI response/resistance of CML stem/progenitor cells. These studies implicate AHI-1 as a potential therapeutic target downstream of BCR-ABL in CML.",

Bcr/Abl point mutations and other alterations reduce the kinase inhibitory activity of imatinib mesylate; thus, agents that target Bcr/Abl through unique mechanisms may be needed. Here we describe the activity of WP1130, a small molecule that specifically and rapidly down-regulates both wild-type and mutant Bcr/Abl protein without affecting bcr/abl gene expression in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells. Loss of Bcr/Abl protein correlated with the onset of apoptosis and reduced phosphorylation of Bcr/Abl substrates. WP1130 did not affect Hsp90/Hsp70 ratios within the cells and did not require the participation of the proteasomal pathway for loss of Bcr/Abl protein. WP1130 was more effective in reducing leukemic versus normal hematopoietic colony formation and strongly inhibited colony formation of cells derived from patients with T315I mutant Bcr/Abl-expressing CML in blast crisis. WP1130 suppressed the growth of K562 heterotransplanted tumors as well as both wild-type Bcr/Abl and T315I mutant Bcr/Abl-expressing BaF/3 cells transplanted into nude mice.

This chromosomal translocation results in the fusion between the 5' part of the BCR gene, normally located on chromosome 22, and the 3' part of the ABL gene on chromosome 9 giving origin to a BCR-ABL fusion gene which is transcribed and then translated into a hybrid protein. In general, three breakpoint cluster regions in the BCR gene have been described: major (M-BCR), minor (m-BCR) and micro (μ-BCR). Three main variants of the BCR-ABL gene have been described depending on the length of the sequence of the BCR gene included that encode for the P190, P210, P230 proteins. Most patients (95 %) were found to have P210 protein that resulted from rearrangement in the M-BCR region in the BCR gene and thus gives rise to b2a2 or b3a2 variants. The incidence of one or other rearrangement in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients varies in different reported series. These two variants are associated with distinct clinical types of human leukemias. In this study, we report the frequencies of M-BCR-ABL fusion transcripts in 44 CML patients and we review the data on the correlations between the type of M-BCR/ABL variant and the corresponding sex, age and biological features. Forty-four untreated chronic phase CML patients were studied. The type of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). More than half of them showed b3a2 fusion transcript (64 %), while (36 %) showed b2a2 transcript. No patients coexpressed b3a2/b2a2. Correlation between biological data demonstrated that: (a) M-BCR rearrangements were not associated with the sex of the patients. (b) Patients with b3a2 rearrangements were older than patients with b2a2 transcripts. (c) M-BCR rearrangements were influenced neither by the white blood count (WBC) nor with hemoglobin levels. However, platelet level is more elevated in patients with b3a2 transcript (681.2/L vs. 207/L; P = 0.001). In conclusion, we observed significant correlations between age, platelet level and M-BCR-ABL transcript, these observations deserve further investigations.",

Transformation from chronic to blastic phase is the lethal step in CML. Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are the basic reason for blastic transformation. It has been shown that Wnt/β-catenin signaling contributes to the self-renewal capacity and proliferation of LSCs in CML. However, the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in blastic transformation of CML is still obscure. Here, we explored the relationship between BCR-ABL and β-catenin signaling in vitro and in vivo. We found that BCR-ABL stimulated β-catenin via activation of PI3K/AKT signaling in blastic phase CML cells. Inhibition of the kinase activity of BCR-ABL, PI3K, or AKT decreased the level of β-catenin in both K562 cells and a CML mouse model and suppressed the transcription of downstream target genes (c-myc and cyclin D1). In addition, inhibition of the BCR-ABL/PI3K/AKT pathway delayed the disease progression in the CML mouse model. To further explore the role of β-catenin in the self-renewal and survival of CML LSCs, we established a secondary transplantation CML mouse model. Our data revealed that inhibition of the BCR-ABL/PI3K/AKT pathway reduced the tumor-initiating ability of K562 cells, decreased leukemia cell infiltration into peripheral blood and bone marrow, and prolonged the survival of mice. In conclusion, our data indicate a close relationship between β-catenin and BCR-ABL/PI3K/AKT in blastic phase CML. β-Catenin inhibition may be of therapeutic value by targeting LSCs in combination with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which may delay blastic transformation of CML.",

In the context of ABL, these domains have an autoinhibitory effect on kinase activity, and mutations in this region can activate the enzyme. To determine the frequency and relevance to resistance of regulatory domain mutations in CML patients on imatinib, we screened for such mutations in a cohort of consecutive CML patients with various levels of response. Regulatory domain mutations were detected in 7 of 98 patients, whereas kinase domain mutations were detected in 29. One mutation (T212R) conferred in vitro tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance and was associated with relapse, whereas most other mutations did not affect drug sensitivity. Mechanistic studies showed that T212R increased the activity of ABL and BCR-ABL and that T212R-induced resistance may be partially the result of stabilization of an active kinase conformation.

In the present study, we analyzed the expression and role of HO-1 in CML cells. As assessed by Northern and Western blot analysis as well as immunostaining, primary CML cells were found to express HO-1 mRNA and the HO-1 protein in a constitutive manner. Exposure of these cells to the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 resulted in decreased expression of HO-1 mRNA and protein. In addition, BCR/ABL was found to up-regulate HO-1 promoter activity, mRNA levels, and protein levels in Ba/F3 cells. To investigate the role of HO-1 for survival of primary CML cells, the HO-1 inducer hemin was used. Hemin-induced expression of HO-1 was found to protect CML cells from STI571-induced cell death. In addition, inhibition of HO-1 by zinc-(II)-deuteroporphyrin-IX-2,4-bisethyleneglycol resulted in a substantial decrease of cell viability. Furthermore, overexpression of HO-1 in the CML-derived cell line K562 was found to counteract STI571-induced apoptosis.

This abnormal enzymatic activation is critical to the oncogenic potential of Bcr-Abl. Initially, protein kinases were thought to be poor therapeutic targets because of their ubiquitous nature and crucial role in many normal physiologic processes. However, the advent of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland), formerly known as STI571 and CGP57148B, demonstrated that designer kinase inhibitors could be specific. This agent has shown striking activity in chronic myelogenous leukemia. It also inhibits phosphorylation of Kit (stem-cell factor receptor) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. In addition, it has shown similar impressive responses, with little host toxicity, in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, which harbor activating Kit mutations, and in tumors with activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor. The studies of imatinib mesylate provide proof-of-principle for using aberrant kinases as a therapeutic target and are a model for the promise of molecular therapeutics.

Prior work has identified the adapter protein CRKL as a major substrate of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. CRKL can also bind via its first SH3 domain [SH3(1)] to specific sequences in Bcr-Abl. Cell-penetrating peptides were developed that bind with high affinity and selectivity to the SH3(1) domain of CRKL. They disrupt Bcr-Abl-CRKL complexes and strongly reduce the proliferation of primary CML blast cells and cell lines established from Bcr-Abl-positive patients. Activation-specific antibodies against phosphorylated MAP kinase (MAPK) showed that MAPK activity is down-regulated in blast cells treated with the CRKLSH3(1) blocker peptides. We conclude that the Bcr-Abl-CRKL complexes are largely dependent on the CRKLSH3(1) domain, that the central mitogenic cascade is down-regulated as a consequence of the disruption of CRKLSH3(1) interactions, and that CRKL therefore contributes to the proliferation of CML blast cells.",

As the mitogenic and transforming activities of tyrosine kinases involve stimulation of the Ras pathway, we analyzed Bcr-Abl oncoproteins for interactions with cytoplasmic proteins that mediate Ras activation. Such polypeptides include Grb2, which comprises a single Src homology 2 (SH2) domain flanked by two SH3 domains, and the 66, 52 and 46 kDa Shc proteins which possess an SH2 domain in their carboxy-terminus. Grb2 associates with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins through its SH2 domain, and with the Ras guanine nucleotide releasing protein mSos1 through its SH3 domains. mSos1 stimulates conversion of the inactive GDP-bound form of Ras to the active GTP-bound state. In bcr-abl-transformed cells, Grb2 and mSos1 formed a physical complex with Bcr-Abl. In vitro, the Grb2 SH2 domain bound Bcr-Abl through recognition of a tyrosine phosphorylation site within the amino-terminal bcr-encoded sequence (p.Tyr177-Val-Asn-Val), that is common to both Bcr-Abl proteins. These results suggest that autophosphorylation within the Bcr element of Bcr-Abl creates a direct physical link to Grb2-mSos1, and potentially to the Ras pathway, and thereby modifies the target specificity of the Abl tyrosine kinase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Delivery of microRNA (miRNA) using non-viral vectors has been utilized to inhibit various cancer cells; however, the efficacy of this approach to target CML stem/progenitor cells has not been elucidated. In this study, we firstly validated that spermine-introduced pullulan (Ps) was a robust non-viral vector for delivery of miRNA to CML cells, including the CD34+ cells from clinical isolates. We then found that the miR-181a/RALA (V-ral simian leukemia viral oncogene homolog A) axis was aberrantly expressed in the CML CD34+ cells. The delivery of miR-181a specifically inhibited the growth of CML CD34+ cells, possibly via the inhibition of RALA. In contrast, miR-181a did not evidently affect the normal hematopoietic CD34+ cells. In addition, miR-181a increased IM sensitivity of the CD34+ CML cells. Taken together, we have therefore demonstrated that the delivery of miR-181a using Ps to CML stem/progenitor cells leads to their growth inhibition and enhancement of IM sensitivity, which will possibly be beneficial to CML treatment.",

However, although BCR/ABL-expressing cell lines have an equivalent cell survival, they have an increase in chromosomal translocations after DNA repair as compared to control cells. This demonstrates that BCR/ABL expression decreases the fidelity of DNA repair. To see whether this is true in primary CML samples, normal CD34+ progenitor cells and CML progenitor cells were treated with etoposide. CML progenitor cells have equivalent survival but have an increase in DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Spectral karyotyping demonstrates new chromosomal translocations in CML cells, but not normal progenitor cells, consistent with error-prone DNA repair.

The exact phenotype of the hematopoietic stem cell and the hierarchical level of the occurrence of this mutation in leukemic hematopoiesis has not been determined. To study the effects of T315I-mutated breakpoint cluster region-abelson (BCR-ABL) in a primitive hematopoietic stem cell, we have used the murine embryonic stem cell (mESC)-derived hematopoiesis model. Native and T315I-mutated BCR-ABL were introduced retrovirally in mESC-derived embryonic bodies followed by induction of hematopoiesis. In several experiments, T315I-mutated and nonmutated BCR-ABL-transduced embryonic bodies rapidly generated hematopoietic cells on OP-9 feeders, with evidence of hematopoietic stem cell markers. After injection into NOD/SCID mice, these cells induced myeloid and lymphoid leukemias, whereas transplantation of control (nontransduced) hematopoietic cells failed to produce any hematopoietic reconstitution in vivo. Moreover, the expression of native and T315I-mutated BCR-ABL conferred to mESC-derived hematopoietic cells a self-renewal capacity demonstrated by the generation of leukemias after secondary transplantations. Secondary leukemias were more aggressive with evidence of extramedullary tumors. The expression of stem cell regulator Musashi-2 was found to be increased in bone marrow of leukemic mice. These data show that T315I-mutated BCR-ABL is functional at the stem cell level, conferring to mESC-derived leukemic cells a long-term hematopoietic repopulation ability. This model could be of interest to test the efficiency of drugs at the stem cell level in leukemias with T315I mutation.",

Therefore, it is of great importance to understand the molecular mechanisms affecting cancer cell sensitivity and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.;In this study, we used continuous exposure to stepwise increasing concentrations of imatinib (0.6-1 μM) to select imatinib-resistant K562 cells.;Expression of BCR-ABL increased both at RNA and protein levels in imatinib-resistant cell lines. Furthermore, expression levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) were increased significantly in resistant cells, channeling sphingoid bases to the SphK1 pathway and activating sphingosine-1-phosphate-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation pathways that include the adaptor protein Crk. The partial inhibition of SphK1 activity by N,N-dimethylsphingosine or expression by small interfering RNA increased sensitivity to imatinib-induced apoptosis in resistant cells and returned BCR-ABL to baseline levels. To determine the resistance mechanism-induced SphK1 upregulation, we used pharmacological inhibitors of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway and observed robust downmodulation of SphK1 expression and activity when AKT2, but not AKT1 or AKT3, was suppressed.;These results demonstrate that SphK1 is upregulated in imatinib-resistant K562 cells by a pathway contingent on a phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT2/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. We propose that SphK1 plays an important role in development of acquired resistance to imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines.",

However, a significant proportion of patients treated with TKIs develop resistance because of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and T315I mutant Bcr-Abl. Here we describe the unknown activity of the natural product berbamine that efficiently eradicates LSCs and T315I mutant Bcr-Abl clones. Unexpectedly, we identify CaMKII γ as a specific and critical target of berbamine for its antileukemia activity. Berbamine specifically binds to the ATP-binding pocket of CaMKII γ, inhibits its phosphorylation and triggers apoptosis of leukemia cells. More importantly, CaMKII γ is highly activated in LSCs but not in normal hematopoietic stem cells and coactivates LSC-related β-catenin and Stat3 signaling networks. The identification of CaMKII γ as a specific target of berbamine and as a critical molecular switch regulating multiple LSC-related signaling pathways can explain the unique antileukemia activity of berbamine. These findings also suggest that berbamine may be the first ATP-competitive inhibitor of CaMKII γ, and potentially, can serve as a new type of molecular targeted agent through inhibition of the CaMKII γ activity for treatment of leukemia.",

In this study, microarray analysis revealed that c-Jun, a monopoiesis-promoting transcription factor, was downregulated in CML neutrophils. BCR-ABL directly inhibited c-Jun expression, as c-Jun downregulation in primary CML neutrophils and in the CML blast cell lines, KCL22 and K562, was reversed by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. We established a myeloid differentiation model in KCL22 cells using zinc-inducible CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)alpha (KCL22/alpha). Myeloid differentiation was observed in C/EBP-induced KCL22/alpha cells. Imatinib-induced c-Jun upregulation promoted the monocytic differentiation of KCL22/alpha cells. c-Jun knockdown in KCL22/alpha cells by a short interfering RNA redirected their differentiation from the monocytic to the neutrophilic lineage, even after imatinib treatment. A blockade of PI3K-Akt signaling with an Akt inhibitor upregulated c-Jun and induced the monocytic differentiation of KCL22, K562, and C/EBP-induced KCL22/alpha cells. Thus, BCR-ABL downregulates c-Jun expression by activating the PI3K-Akt pathway during CML-CP, thereby allowing C/EBPs to promote neutrophil differentiation.",

The archetypical disease in this regard is chronic myeloid leukemia, where abl is constitutively activated by fusion with the bcr gene (bcr/abl). Similarly, the drug has now been shown to display equally impressive therapeutic activity in eosinophilia-associated chronic myeloproliferative disorders that are characterized by activating mutations of either the PDGFRB or the PDGFRA gene. The former usually results from translocations involving chromosome 5q31-33, and the latter usually results from an interstitial deletion involving chromosome 4q12 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA).

Imatinib (IM), the first line treatment for CML, is excessively expensive and induces various side effects in CML patients. Therefore, it is essential to investigate a new strategy for improving CML therapy. Our immunoblot data revealed that RanGTPase activating protein 1 (RanGAP1) protein levels increased by approximately 30-fold in K562 cells compared with those in normal cells. RanGAP1 is one of the important components of RanGTPase system, which regulates the export of nuclear protein. However, whether RanGAP1 level variation influences BCR-ABL nuclear export is still unknown. In this report, using shRNA to downregulate RanGAP1 expression level augmented K562 cell apoptosis by approximately 40% after treatment with 250 nM IM. Immunofluorescence assay also indicated that three-fold of nuclear BCR-ABL was detected. These data suggest that BCR-ABL nuclear entrapment induced by RanGAP1 downregulation can be used to improve IM efficacy. Moreover, our qRT-PCR data indicated a trend of inverse correlation between the RanGAP1 and microRNA (miR)-1301 levels in CML patients. MiR-1301, targeting the RanGAP1 3' untranslated region, decreased by approximately 100-fold in K562 cells compared with that in normal cells. RanGAP1 downregulation by miR-1301 transfection impairs BCR-ABL nuclear export to increase approximately 60% of cell death after treatment of 250 nM IM. This result was almost the same as treatment with 1000 nM IM alone. Furthermore, immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that Tyr-99 of nuclear P73 was phosphorylated accompanied with nuclear entrapment of BCR-ABL after transfection with RanGAP1 shRNA or miR-1301 in IM-treated K562 cells. Altogether, we demonstrated that RanGAP1 downregulation can mediate BCR-ABL nuclear entrapment to activate P73-dependent apoptosis pathway which is a novel strategy for improving current IM treatment for CML.

The microRNAs (miRNAs), namely miR-219-2 and miR-199b, centromeric to the ABL1 gene are frequently lost in CML patients. We have designed a study to determine miR-219-2 and miR-199b expression levels which would help to understand the prognosis of imatinib therapy. A total of 150 CML patients were analyzed to identify 9q deletion. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using BCR/ABL dual color, dual fusion probe to study the signal pattern and BAC probes for miR-199b and miR-219-2 (RP11-339B21 and RP11-395P17) to study the miRNA deletions. The expression level of miRNA was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). FISH analysis revealed 9q34.1 deletion in 34 (23%) CML patients. The deletions were not detected using BAC probes for miRNAs in 9q deleted patients. The expression analysis showed down-regulation of miR-199b and miR-219-2 in the 9q deleted patients (34 CML) as compared to a pool of patients without deletion. However, miR-199b (9q34.11) was significantly (p=0.001) down-regulated compared to miR-219-2. The follow-up study showed that the miR-199b was found to be strongly associated with imatinib resistance, as 44.11% patients showed resistance to imatinib therapy.

Caspase activation and cleavage of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) accompanied the development of CGP 57148-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of caspase suppressed apoptosis and the cleavage of pRB, and in turn arrested cells in the G1 phase.

Recent years have seen a shift from microarray analysis and candidate gene sequencing to next-generation sequencing. Together, these approaches have shown that many ALL subtypes are characterized by constellations of structural rearrangements, submicroscopic DNA copy number alterations, and sequence mutations, several of which have clear implications for risk stratification and targeted therapeutic intervention. Mutations in genes regulating lymphoid development are a hallmark of ALL, and alterations of the lymphoid transcription factor gene IKZF1 (IKAROS) are associated with a high risk of treatment failure in B-ALL. Approximately 20% of B-ALL cases harbor genetic alterations that activate kinase signaling that may be amenable to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including rearrangements of the cytokine receptor gene CRLF2; rearrangements of ABL1, JAK2, and PDGFRB; and mutations of JAK1 and JAK2. Whole-genome sequencing has also identified novel targets of mutation in aggressive T-lineage ALL, including hematopoietic regulators (ETV6 and RUNX1), tyrosine kinases, and epigenetic regulators.

        "Doc_abstract":"Recent evidence suggests that a rare population of self-renewing cancer stem cells (CSC) is responsible for cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) represents an important paradigm for understanding the genetic and epigenetic events involved in CSC production. CML progresses from a chronic phase (CP) in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that harbor the BCR-ABL translocation, to blast crisis (BC), characterized by aberrant activation of beta-catenin within granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP). A major barrier to predicting and inhibiting blast crisis transformation has been the identification of mechanisms driving beta-catenin activation. Here we show that BC CML myeloid progenitors, in particular GMP, serially transplant leukemia in immunocompromised mice and thus are enriched for leukemia stem cells (LSC). Notably, cDNA sequencing of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway regulatory genes, including adenomatous polyposis coli, GSK3beta, axin 1, beta-catenin, lymphoid enhancer factor-1, cyclin D1, and c-myc, revealed a novel in-frame splice deletion of the GSK3beta kinase domain in the GMP of BC samples that was not detectable by sequencing in blasts or normal progenitors. Moreover, BC CML progenitors with misspliced GSK3beta have enhanced beta-catenin expression as well as serial engraftment potential while reintroduction of full-length GSK3beta reduces both in vitro replating and leukemic engraftment. We propose that CP CML is initiated by BCR-ABL expression in an HSC clone but that progression to BC may include missplicing of GSK3beta in GMP LSC, enabling unphosphorylated beta-catenin to participate in LSC self-renewal. Missplicing of GSK3beta represents a unique mechanism for the emergence of BC CML LSC and might provide a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target.",

Two-color BCR-ABL probes visualizing one fusion signal (1F FISH) have high false positive rates (FPR) and false negative rates (FNR). The FPR is a result of the random spatial association of probe signals within normal interphase cells so that some cells appear to contain the BCR-ABL fusion gene. The FNR of 1F FISH probes depends on the distance between the BCR and ABL probes hybridized to the BCR-ABL fusion gene (< or =368 kb); the \"gap\" between the signals causing the cell to be interpreted as normal. To overcome these difficulties, a two-color probe was used, employing four yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) sequences that span the breakpoint regions of the BCR and ABL genes and that visualize the two fusion signals BCR-ABL and ABL-BCR in CML cells (2F FISH). The FNR for the 2F FISH probes was assessed on clonal Ph+ granulocyte-macrophage-colony-forming cell (CFU-GM) derived colonies and was reduced to 0.4% (2/450), compared with an FNR of 13.5% (111/823) with 1F FISH.

Bcr-Abl is coupled to many of the same signaling pathways normally regulated by hematopoietic cytokines. Recent work shows that Hck, a member of the Src tyrosine kinase family with myeloid-restricted expression, associates with and is activated by Bcr-Abl. Here we investigated the mechanism of Hck interaction with Bcr-Abl and the requirement for Hck activation in Bcr-Abl transformation signaling. Binding studies demonstrated that the Hck SH3 and SH2 domains are sufficient for interaction with Bcr-Abl in vitro. Hck binding localizes to the Abl SH2, SH3, and kinase domains as well as the distal portion of the C-terminal tail. To address the requirement for endogenous Src family kinase activation in Bcr-Abl signaling, a kinase-defective mutant of Hck was stably expressed in the cytokine-dependent myeloid leukemia cell line DAGM. Kinase-defective Hck dramatically suppressed Bcr-Abl-induced outgrowth of these cells in the absence of cytokine compared with a control cell line expressing beta-galactosidase. In contrast, kinase-defective Hck did not affect cell proliferation in response to interleukin-3, suggesting that the effect is specific for Bcr-Abl. These data show that Hck interacts with Bcr-Abl through a complex mechanism involving kinase-dependent and -independent components and that interaction with Hck or other Src family members is essential for transformation signaling by Bcr-Abl.",

To determine the frequency of compound mutations among chronic myeloid leukemia patients on ABL1 TKI therapy, in the present study, we examined a collection of patient samples (N = 47) with clear evidence of 2 BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations by direct sequencing. Using a cloning and sequencing method, we found that 70% (33/47) of double mutations detected by direct sequencing were compound mutations. Sequential, branching, and parallel routes to compound mutations were common. In addition, our approach revealed individual and compound mutations not detectable by direct sequencing. The frequency of clones harboring compound mutations with more than 2 missense mutations was low (10%), whereas the likelihood of silent mutations increased disproportionately with the total number of mutations per clone, suggesting a limited tolerance for BCR-ABL1 kinase domain missense mutations.

However, resistance is occasionally observed, mainly due to mutations within the BCR-ABL kinase domain. The T315I substitution confers complete resistance to all TKIs commonly used in clinical practice. To date, the hierarchical level of stem cells in which this mutation initially appears has not been studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the behavior of T315I mutated cells and to study the presence of potential additional mutations in progenitors and stem cells from a patient with CML. A comprehensive analysis of BCR-ABL(315I) mRNA expressing cells in mononuclear cells, in CD34+ cell populations, and in their primitive long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) derived progenitors was performed. We show that the T315I substitution arises in primitive Ph1 stem cells without altering their myeloid and erythroid terminal differentiation potential. Leukemic cells expressing a T315I mutated BCR-ABL display a progressive decline in LTC-IC assays as described for non-mutated CML cells at diagnosis. Finally, in our experiments, additional non-315 ABL mutations were identified in hematopoietic stem cell colonies. This observation is suggestive of genetic instability affecting CML progenitors.",

Development of new drug carriers, is presently one of the most challenging tasks in experimental oncology. In this report we investigated whether the toxicity of newly synthetized doxorubicin transferrin conjugate (DOX-TRF) may be connected to the limitation of multidrug resistance in CML cells by the alternations of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The studies were performed on human chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines sensitive (K562) and resistant (K562/DOX) to doxorubicin. Our research proves that DOX-TRF conjugate displays higher cytotoxicity toward both examined cell lines than the reference free drug (DOX) and induces more extensive pro-apoptotic changes. Moreover, by the of engagement of Wnt pathway agonist (LiCl) and antagonist (ICG 001) we demonstrate that DOX-TRF conjugate effectively reduces transcription of key genes involved in β-catenin signaling transduction trial (Wnt3a, DVL-1, FZD-3, LRP5, β-catenin, DKK2) and triggers morphology alternations of CML cells.

Despite being comparable for all classical parameters, the incidence of relapse was significantly higher in the high MRD group (11/14 (79%)) compared to that of the low/negative MRD group (7/24 (29%)) (P = 0.009), with d100 MRD values representing an independent risk factor of relapse and disease-free survival, but not of overall survival, in multivariate analysis.

Results using BCR-ABL mutants which specifically uncouple connections to known signal transduction pathways show that STAT5 activation is kinase dependent and correlates directly with ability to confer cytokine independent growth in hematopoietic cells.

Imatinib mesylate is a specific inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl kinase and has shown promising results in clinical studies. The structural relation between the Bcr-Abl oncogene and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib has recently been elucidated by an elegant crystal structure analysis, emphasizing the importance of dephosphorylated tyrosine 393 (Tyr393) in Bcr-Abl for access of the inhibitor to the kinase domain. By mutating this tyrosine to phenylalanine and thereby mimicking a constitutively dephosphorylated state, we now show that Ba/F3 cells transformed by this mutant demonstrate an increased sensitivity towards imatinib in vivo. This effect is not due to an impaired kinase activity of Bcr-Abl Y393F, since a synthetic substrate is phosphorylated with similar kinetics. Treatment of Ba/F3 cells transfected with Bcr-Abl wild type with a phosphatase inhibitor diminished the effect of imatinib, but did not influence the growth of Ba/F3 cells transfected with Bcr-AblY393F. The results support the findings of the crystal structure and indicate that Tyr393 indeed plays a significant role for the sensitivity of Bcr-Abl towards imatinib in vivo.

Of whom, 24 were male, and 8 were female. Twenty-three patients have been transplanted in CR1, 9 patients beyond CR1 (1 in CR2, 8 in refractory or relapse status). Twelve cases received HSCT from identical sibling donor, 4 unrelated Cord Blood Transplantation (CBT), 3 HSCT from matched unrelated donor (MUD), and 13 HSCT from mismatched related donor (MMRD), of which, 6 cases were M(BCR/ABL) subtype, and 20 m(BCR/ABL) subtype. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the probabilities of leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS) and relapse incidence (RI), and the factors were compared by means of the Log-rank test. Simultaneous effect of multiple covariates were estimated with Cox model.;Of all the 32 cases engrafted, 4-year OS was 57.19%, LFS 37.09%, and RI 56.36%. In univariate prognostic analysis model, the OS was higher in CR1 group pre-HSCT than that in non-CR1 group (74.50% vs 22.22%, P=0.0046), LFS was higher (49.06% vs 11.11%, P=0.0057), RI was lower (44.80% vs 84.76%, P=0.0157); the OS was higher in M(BCR/ABL) group than that in m(BCR/ABL) group (100% vs 40.91%, P=0.0318), LFS was higher (75% vs 17.72%, P=0.0057), RI was lower (25% vs 77.88, P=0.0116); OS was similar in HLA MM RD group to that in HLA identical group (52.65% vs 55.56%, P=0.6247), LFS was similar (45.12% vs 30.00%, P=0.8315), and RI was also similar (50.77% vs 60.62%, P=0.8217). In multiple covariate analysis model, the BCR/ABL type was the risk factor of LFS [P=0.005, Exp(B)=9.971] and RI (P=0.006, Exp(B)=9.488), the status of disease pre-HSCT and BCR/ABL subtype was the risk factor of OS [P was 0.010 and 0.038, Exp(B) was 4.532 and 37.537 respectively].;We had better do HSCT in CR1 to treat Ph+ ALL, if patient is refractory to chemotherapy, we can try STI571, and HSCT should be done as soon as possible if the patients get CR. Mismatched related donor is considered as regular donor for Ph+ ALL patients without identical donors. We should pay more attention to monitoring and prophylaxis of relapse in m(BCR/ABL) patients after HSCT.",

All three showed >90% mutant transcript. The first resulted from the insertion of 79 nucleotides into the ABL1 exon 8-9 junction. The inserted sequence contained a sequence from regions of intron 8, located 120 bp apart: the 35-nucleotide sequence previously described, and an additional 44-nucleotide segment downstream from 35INS. The combined 79-nucleotide insertion splice mutant showed the same protein change as 35INS (p C475YfsX11). The second splice mutation comprised an 84-nucleotide sequence from intron 7 inserted into the ABL1 exon7-8 junction, also causing a frameshift and protein truncation (p A424EfsX18). The third splice derived from a 231-nucleotide sequence from intron 4 retained in the ABL1 exon 4-5 junction adding 40 intron-encoded amino acids and leading to a frameshift and early termination (p E275LfsX41).;These findings, when combined with the data on 35INS, support the concept that loss of the C-terminus of BCR-ABL1 is associated with significant resistance to kinase inhibitors; this mechanism appears to be a major source of resistance to kinase inhibitors.",

Their normal counterparts, B cell precursor cells, are positively selected for survival signals through the antigen receptor, whose expression requires a functional immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene rearrangement. Unexpectedly, B cell precursor leukemia cells harboring a BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangement do not depend on antigen receptor mediated survival signals. Genes involved in the signaling cascade of the antigen receptor are silenced and in most cases, the dominant tumor clone does not carry a functional IGH gene rearrangement. However, upon inhibition of the BCR-ABL1 kinase activity by STI571, only leukemia cells expressing an antigen receptor are able to survive. Since resistance to STI571 is frequent in the therapy of BCR-ABL1(+) B cell precursor leukemia, antigen receptor signaling may represent a mechanism through which these cells can temporarily evade STI571-induced apoptosis. This may open a time frame, during which leukemia cells acquire secondary transforming events that confer definitive resistance to STI571.",

When injected either intravenously or intraperitoneally into 300 cGy irradiated SCID mice, animals formed multiple granulocytic sarcomas involving the adrenals, kidneys, lymph nodes and other organs. The mean survival time was 34+/-10 days (n = 40) after intravenous injection and 24+/-3 days (n = 5) after intraperitoneal injection of 20 million cells. The cells recovered from leukemic animals continued to express interleukin-3 receptors and remained sensitive to the diphtheria fusion protein DT388IL3. Further, these granulocytic sarcoma-derived cells grew again in irradiated SCID mice (n = 10). The cytogenetic abnormalities observed prior to inoculation in mice were stably present after in vivo passage. Similar to the results with v-Src transfected TF-1 cells, in vivo leukemic growth was observed with TF-1 cells transfected with the human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor gene (n = 5) and with TF-1 cells recovered from subcutaneous tumors in nude mice (n = 5). In contrast, TF-1 cells expressing v-Ha-Ras (n = 5), BCR-ABL (n = 5), or activated Raf-1 (n = 44) did not grow in irradiated SCID mice.

Accordingly, the natural history of the diseases has changed, and patients in complete molecular response now have the same life expectancy of their healthy coetaneous. Notwithstanding these results, ∼ 20 - 30% of patients do not respond optimally to TKIs therapy, and most of these patients are potential candidates to progress toward the accelerated or blastic phase of the disease. Unfortunately, patients who become resistant to both first- and second-generation TKIs develop BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, against which TKIs have extremely low cross-activity. In particular, none of the TKIs, with the exception of ponatinib, has significant activity against T315 mutation, which is estimated to be present in ∼ 15 - 20% of patients carrying BCR-ABL mutations. The use of omacetaxine mepesuccinate/homoharringtonine for the treatment of TKI-resistant CML patients regained interest due to its mechanism of action independent of binding to the ATP-binding pocket.

The present study screened for the presence of bcr‑abl transcripts in the blood of a group of healthy individuals using a sensitive‑nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR) assay. Samples were collected from 189 healthy volunteers (145 adults and 44 children). RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified by two rounds of PCR, amplifying the two common variants of bcr‑abl transcripts, p190 and p210. While the bcr‑abl p190 transcript was not detected, the p210 transcript was detected in ~10% of samples. Notably, the incidence of p210 translocation was higher in males (12.2%) compared with females (7.7%) and males were 2.4 times more likely to have the translocation. A significant incidence was also observed in adults compared with children, where adults were 6 times more likely to have the translocation. The presence of bcr‑abl transcripts in the blood of a significant proportion of healthy individuals should be considered in long‑term investigations to establish its exact association with the risk of developing leukemia.

The authors describe the experience at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center regarding vascular events associated with nilotinib therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Overall, 5 cases of PAOD were identified among 233 patients, for an incidence of 2%. Nilotinib is a highly selective inhibitor of the inactive conformation of ABL1 kinase. An improved topologic fit to the ABL1 protein-binding surface contributes to its increased potency over imatinib. This higher selectivity in vitro translated to an improved tolerability in vivo. In fact, nilotinib therapy in the frontline phase III ENESTnd (Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials-Newly Diagnosed Patients) study was associated with an improved toxicity profile compared with that of imatinib. Intriguingly, several cases of severe peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD) have been reported among patients treated with nilotinib in small series.

The translated fusion product is an oncogenic protein with increased ABL tyrosine kinase activity causing cell transformation. To date, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is considered the most sensitive method available for detecting low copy numbers of the BCR-ABL gene fusion. Recently, Cepheid introduced its GeneXpert-based assay for the identification of the BCR-ABL gene fusion in cells from blood samples. This system comprises a walk-away self-contained instrument that combines cartridge-based microfluidic sample preparation with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based fluorescent signal detection and BCR-ABL and ABL Ct (threshold cycle) determination. The difference between the BCR-ABL Ct and ABL Ct (DeltaCt) is expected to represent the ratio of the two populations of mRNAs and ultimately the percentage of neoplastic cells present. We tested whether this BCR-ABL fusion detection system could be used as a clinical diagnostic tool for monitoring patients with minimal residual disease of chronic myelogenous leukemia. We report similar performance characteristics, including limit of detection, specificity, sensitivity, and precision, of this automated BCR-ABL fusion detection system to those of a manual TaqMan reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based test.",

Hence, sustained remission requires a long phase of therapy. Data indicate that a combination of different available targeted drugs might prevent treatment failure due to drug resistance, especially at advanced stages of the disease. However, for long-term multiple-drug treatments, complications can arise from side effects. We investigate whether and how the number of drugs could be reduced during long-term therapy. Using computational models, we show that one or more drugs can be removed once the number of tumor cells is reduced significantly, without compromising the chances of sustained tumor suppression. Which drug to remove first depends on the number of mutations in the BCR-ABL gene that confer resistance to the drugs, as well as on how effectively the drugs inhibit Bcr-Abl protein tyrosine kinase activity and inhibit tumor growth. We further show that the number of CML cells at which the number of drugs can be reduced does not correlate with the two phases of decline of the BCR-ABL transcript numbers. Neither does it depend much on kinetic parameters of CML growth, except for the mutation rates at which resistance is generated. This is a significant finding because even without any information on most parameters, and using only the data on the number of cancer cells and the rate at which resistant mutants are generated, it is possible to predict at which stage of treatment the number of drugs can be reduced.",

Although the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) origin of MPDs was suggested over 30 years ago, only recently the HSC-specific effects of MPD molecular mutations have been investigated. The pivotal role of BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) development provided the rationale for targeted therapy, which greatly reduced mortality rates. However, BCR-ABL inhibitor-resistant CML HSCs persist that may be a reservoir for relapse. This has provided the impetus for investigating molecular mechanisms governing the production of recalcitrant HSC. Comparatively little was known about the molecular events driving BCR-ABL-negative MPDs until seminal studies revealed that a large proportion of MPD patients harbor a JAK2-activating point mutation, JAK2V617F. Although JAK2 activation appears to be central to BCR-ABL-negative MPD pathogenesis, its effects may be cell type and context specific. Recent evidence suggests that acquired mutations misdirect differentiation and survival of the MPD-initiating stem cell resulting in the production of aberrant self-renewing progenitors that subvert the microenvironment leading to leukemia stem cell generation and leukemic transformation. Thus, combined therapies targeting aberrant molecular pathways may be required to redirect miscreant MPD stem cells.",

In a case of acute undifferentiated leukemia, the oncogene can is fused to a different gene, named set, instead of dek and is assumed to be activated. Transcripts of set encode a putative SET protein with a predicted molecular mass of 32 kDa. We identified SET as a 39-kDa protein by immunoprecipitation with rabbit antiserum against each of three synthetic peptides predicted from the open reading frame of the set gene. We confirmed this identification of SET by protein sequencing. We also observed that SET is expressed ubiquitously in various human cell lines. SET is phosphorylated on serine residue(s) in cultured cells and is localized predominantly in nuclei. Although the function(s) of SET and SET-CAN is not known, we propose that SET plays a key role in the mechanism of leukemogenesis in acute undifferentiated leukemia, perhaps by activating CAN in nuclei and stimulating the transformation potential of SET-CAN.

Nearly 60% of the newly identified subtype discriminating genes are novel markers not identified in our previous study, and thus should provide new insights into the altered biology underlying these leukemias. Moreover, a proportion of the newly selected genes are highly ranked as class discriminators, and when incorporated into class-predicting algorithms resulted in an overall diagnostic accuracy of 97%.

In this study, we show that BCR-ABL enhances HAUSP-induced de-ubiquitination of PTEN in turn favoring its nuclear exclusion. We further demonstrate that BCR-ABL physically interacts with and phosphorylates HAUSP on tyrosine residues to trigger its activity. Importantly, we also find that PTEN delocalization induced by BCR-ABL does not occur in the leukemic stem cell compartment due to high levels of PML, a potent inhibitor of HAUSP activity toward PTEN. We therefore identify a new proto-oncogenic mechanism whereby BCR-ABL antagonizes the nuclear function of the PTEN tumor suppressor, with important therapeutic implications for the eradication of CML minimal residual disease.

Several BCR-ABL inhibitors have multiple targets and pleiotropic effects that could be exploited for their synergistic potential. Testing combinations of such kinase inhibitors identified a strong synergy between danusertib and bosutinib that exclusively affected CML cells harboring BCR-ABL(T315I). To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we applied a systems-level approach comprising phosphoproteomics, transcriptomics and chemical proteomics. Data integration revealed that both compounds targeted Mapk pathways downstream of BCR-ABL, resulting in impaired activity of c-Myc. Using pharmacological validation, we assessed that the relative contributions of danusertib and bosutinib could be mimicked individually by Mapk inhibitors and collectively by downregulation of c-Myc through Brd4 inhibition. Thus, integration of genome- and proteome-wide technologies enabled the elucidation of the mechanism by which a new drug synergy targets the dependency of BCR-ABL(T315I) CML cells on c-Myc through nonobvious off targets.",

Nevertheless, resistance or intolerance to imatinib and other BCR/ABL inhibitors may occur during therapy. Therefore, CML research is focusing on novel targets and targeted drugs. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays an essential role in mitosis. In this study, we examined the expression of Plk1 in CML cells and its potential role as a therapeutic target. Plk1 was found to be expressed in phosphorylated form in the CML cell line K562 as well as in primary CML cells in all patients tested. Inhibition of BCR/ABL by imatinib or nilotinib (AMN107) led to decreased expression of the Plk1 protein in CML cells, suggesting that BCR/ABL promotes Plk1 generation. Silencing of Plk1 in CML cells by a small interfering RNA approach was followed by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, the Plk1-targeting drug BI 2536 was found to inhibit proliferation of imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cells, including leukemic cells, carrying the T315 mutation of BCR/ABL with reasonable IC(50) values (1-50 nmol/L). The growth-inhibitory effects of BI 2536 on CML cells were found to be associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, BI 2536 was found to synergize with imatinib and nilotinib in producing growth inhibition in CML cells. In conclusion, Plk1 is expressed in CML cells and may represent a novel, interesting target in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML.",

The current study assesses and validates expression profiles of selected oncogenic and tumor suppressing miRNAs that are associated with different imatinib mesylate (IM) response in CML patients carrying rare BCR-ABL variants.

Seventeen were transplanted in relapse, and 19 were transplanted in remission. Twenty-three patients had at least one positive bcr-abl polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay after BMT either before a relapse or without subsequent relapse. Ten of these 23 relapsed after a positive assay at a median time from first positive PCR assay of 94 days (range, 28 to 416 days). By comparison, only 2 relapses occurred in the 13 patients with no prior positive PCR assays; both patients had missed at least one scheduled follow-up assay and were not tested 2 months and 26 months before their relapse. The unadjusted relative risk (RR) of relapse associated with a positive PCR assay compared with a negative assay was 5.7 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 26.0, P = .025). In addition, the data suggest that the type of bcr-abl chimeric mRNA detected posttransplant was associated with the risk of relapse: 7 of 10 patients expressing the p190 bcr-abl relapsed, compared with 1 of 8 who expressed only the p210 bcr-abl mRNA (P = .02, log-rank test). The RR of p190 bcr-abl positivity compared to PCR-negative patients was 11.2 (confidence interval 2.3-54.8, P = 0.003), whereas a positive test for p210 bcr-abl was apparently not associated with an increased relative risk. In separate multivariable models, PCR positivity remained a statistically significant risk factor for relapse after separately adjusting for donor (unrelated and partially matched v matched, autologous, and syngeneic), remission status at the time of transplant, the presence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and type of conditioning regimen (total body irradiation dose of < or = 1,200 cGy v > 1,200 cGy). The PCR assay appears to be a useful test for predicting patients at high risk of relapse after BMT and may identify patients who might benefit from therapeutic interventions.

The hallmark of CML is a genetic translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (the Philadelphia chromosome), which creates the abnormal bcr-abl gene and a continuously activated Bcr-Abl protein. Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity leads to signal transduction and cell growth. Traditional therapies for CML include allogeneic stem cell transplantation, interferon alfa, and oral chemotherapeutic agents. However, because Bcr-Abl is the causative abnormality in CML, it represents an ideal target for rational biologic therapy. Imatinib mesylate is an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor that specifically blocks Bcr-Abl function. Clinical trials have demonstrated that imatinib mesylate produces rapid responses in patients with all stages of CML, including those who were resistant to interferon alfa therapy or intolerant of it. When imatinib mesylate therapy was initiated early in the course of CML, there was a complete hematologic response in 98% of the patients and a complete cytogenetic response in 72% of the patients. Although long-term safety and survival data are not yet available, imatinib mesylate is a promising new treatment option for CML that targets the molecular cause of the disease.",

In the present study, we investigated the effect of celastrol on CML cells bearing wild-type Bcr-Abl or T315I-mutant. The results revealed that celastrol potently downregulated the protein levels of Bcr-Abl, and inhibited the growth in CML cells in vitro and in nude mouse xenografts regardless of Bcr-Abl mutation status. Celastrol induced mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. In conclusion, celastrol exhibits potent activity against CML cells bearing wild-type Bcr-Abl or -the T315I-mutant.",

Since stable molecular remissions are thought to be a prerequisite for cure of CML, allogeneic SCT remains the only curative treatment option for younger patients (i.e. beyond the age of 55 years), who have an HLA-matched related or unrelated donor. Nowadays, suitable HLA-matched unrelated donors can be identified for 70% to 75% of caucasian patients lacking an HLA-identical sibling donor, which substantially has promoted the broader application of allogeneic SCT.",

        "Doc_abstract":"It was previously shown that patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) have a rare but consistently detectable population of quiescent (G0) leukemic (Philadelphia chromosome-positive and BCR-ABL-positive [BCR-ABL+]) CD34+ cells. In the study described here, most such cells expressed a primitive phenotype (CD38-, CD45RA-, CD71-, and HLA-DR(lo)) and cultures of these cells containing growth factors produced ultimately larger, but initially more slowly growing clones than do cultures of initially cycling CD34+ leukemic cells. Initially quiescent leukemic cells expressing BCR-ABL proliferated in single-cell cultures in the absence of added growth factors, thereby demonstrating their ability to spontaneously exit G0 and enter a continuously cycling state. Interestingly, on isolation, few of these quiescent BCR-ABL+ cells contained either interleukin-3 (IL-3) or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) transcripts, whereas both were present in most cycling BCR-ABL+ CD34+ cells. However, after 4 days of culture in the absence of added growth factors and in association with their entry into the cell cycle (as indicated by up-regulation of Ki-67 and cdc25 transcripts), IL-3 transcripts became detectable. These findings show that entry of leukemic (BCR-ABL-expressing) progenitors into a quiescent (G0) state in vivo is highest among the most primitive leukemic cell populations, associated with a down-regulation of IL-3 and G-CSF gene expression, and spontaneously reversible in association with up-regulation of IL-3 expression. These results highlight the potential physiologic relevance of quiescent CML progenitors, even in treated patients, in whom these cells would be predicted to have a proliferative advantage over their quiescent normal counterparts when cytokine concentrations are low.",
