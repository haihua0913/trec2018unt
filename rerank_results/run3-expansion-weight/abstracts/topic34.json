This gene was amplified in 3 out of 67 osteosarcomas, 3 out of 20 malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 4 out of 20 liposarcomas, and 4 out of 8 lipomas. The amplification was associated with overexpression of mRNA. In osteosarcomas, contrary to previous findings, all amplifications were observed in primary lesions. In liposarcomas, the amplification was seen exclusively in well-differentiated tumors with high frequency (4/5) but not in other subtypes (0/15). In addition, MDM2 amplification was also frequently found in deep-seated intra- or intermuscular lipomas (4/5). Hence, it is suggested that MDM2 amplification plays a significant role in the development of differentiated adipose-tissue tumors. Three well-differentiated liposarcomas with MDM2 amplification coexisted with high-grade dedifferentiated sarcomas, in which MDM2 amplification was also observed. Interestingly, in 2 of these cases, the grades of amplification correlated with the histological grades, indicating an important role of MDM2 overexpression in tumor progression.",

The measurement of the MDM2 amplification can aid in classification and may provide a predictive value for recently formulated therapies targeting MDM2. We have developed and validated an automated bright field dual-color in situ hybridization application to detect MDM2 gene amplification.;A repeat-depleted MDM2 probe was constructed to target the MDM2 gene region at 12q15. A chromosome 12-specific probe (CHR12) was generated from a pα12H8 plasmid. The in situ hybridization assay was developed by using a dinitrophenyl-labeled MDM2 probe and a digoxigenin-labeled CHR12 probe on the Ventana Medical Systems' automated slide-staining platforms. The specificity of the MDM2 and CHR12 probes was shown on metaphase spreads and further validated against controls, including normal human tonsil and known MDM2-amplified samples. The assay performance was evaluated on a cohort of 100 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens by using a conventional bright field microscope.;Simultaneous hybridization and signal detection for MDM2 and CHR12 showed that both DNA targets were present in the same cells. One hundred soft tissue specimens were stained for MDM2 and CHR12. Although 26 of 29 lipomas were nonamplified and eusomic, MDM2 amplification was noted in 78% of atypical lipomatous tumors or well-differentiated liposarcomas. Five of 6 dedifferentiated liposarcoma cases were amplified for MDM2. MDM2 amplification was observed in 1 of 8 osteosarcomas; 3 showed CHR12 aneusomy. MDM2 amplification was present in 1 of 4 chondrosarcomas. Nine of 10 synovial sarcomas displayed no evidence of MDM2 amplification in most tumor cells. In pleomorphic sarcoma, not otherwise specified (pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma), MDM2 was amplified in 38% of cases, whereas 92% were aneusomic for CHR12. One alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and 2 embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas displayed low-level aneusomy of CHR12 without net MDM2 amplifications.;These results show that the use of the ISH MDM2 and CHR12 assay allows simultaneous analyses of the 2 DNA targets within the context of tissue morphology. This method combines the advantages of a fully automated protocol with bright field microscopy and has the potential for routine application in surgical pathology.",

Positivity for P53 and MDM2 was found in 9.7% and 28.1% tumours, respectively. The fraction of P53 and MDM2 positive tumours was the highest in leiomyosarcomas (16.7% and 17.2%, respectively) and the lowest in dermatofibrosarcomas (0% and 4.3%, respectively). Overall, P53(-)/MDM2(+) phenotype predominated (20.2%), while 7.9% of tumours were both P53 and MDM2 positive, and 1.8% of tumours were only P53 positive. P53 accumulation was associated with a high histological malignancy grade and a higher proliferative rate. MDM2 immunoreactivity was revealed in tumours of all malignancy grades and there was no association between MDM2 positivity and tumours proliferative activity. These results suggest that P53 overexpression underlays rather late events in the oncogenesis of STSs, which might be a determinant of their proliferative rate. In contrast, MDM2 deregulation seems to be an early rather than a late event in STSs, which may occur without involving stabilization and inactivation of P53 gene.",

Four types of genetic disorders can be distinguished: translocations, gene amplifications, mutations and complex genetic imbalances. Detection of these disorders may help in diagnosis and in determining prognosis. Detection of specific translocation is recommended in synovial sarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma or PNET diagnosis because of therapeutic consequences; in case of rarer histologic type (low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, infantile fibrosarcoma...), it may confirm the diagnosis. In some cases, some translocations have a prognostic value (alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma) whereas it is discussed in others (synovial sarcoma). The techniques used to detect these translocations are very sensitive so it may be used to detect microscopical metastasis (bone marrow metastasis of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma for example). Detection of MDM2 and CDK4 genes amplifications (FISH or quantitative PCR) may be sometimes useful in well differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas diagnosis. Mutation detection of KIT or PDGFRA may help in GIST diagnosis and type of mutation is predictive of response to treatment.

Eighty-five cases of nonlipogenic high-grade sarcomas, diagnosed between 2008 and 2011, were investigated.

Thirty-nine of 41 cases, including those originally diagnosed as DDLPS (n=30), undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (n=7), myxofibrosarcoma (n=1), and pleomorphic liposarcoma (n=1) could be reclassified as DDLPS. In addition, MDM2 immunohistochemistry and MDM2 fluorescence in situ hybridization showed an excellent correlation (P<0.001, sensitivity 92.7%, specificity 100%).

It is extremely rare in childhood and its existence in the pediatric population remains controversial. Cytogenetic analysis revealed several alterations previously associated with adult MFH, including abnormalities of chromosomal bands 11p11 and 19p13. Moreover, the tumor demonstrated homogeneously staining regions (HSR) and double minute chromosomes (dmin) suggestive of gene amplification. We therefore screened the case for amplification of genes localized to chromosomal bands 12q13-14, including the putative protooncogenes MDM2, CDK4, SAS, CHOP, and CLI, which are frequently amplified and overexpressed in adult MFH. Southern and Northern blot analysis confirmed the coamplification of MDM2, CDK4, SAS, and CHOP.

Doxorubicin, first reported to have activity in sarcomas 40 years ago, remains the generalizable first-line treatment of choice for many subtypes, with no other drug or combination having shown an overall-survival advantage. Other cytotoxic agents, such as paclitaxel for angiosarcoma or gemcitabine with docetaxel for leiomyosarcoma, are commonly used for certain histologic subtypes based on relatively small studies. Trabectedin, particularly active against leiomyosarcoma and myxoid liposarcoma, is approved in many countries worldwide but not yet in the United States or Australia. Newer cytotoxic agents, including ifosfamide derivatives, are in current phase III testing. Although advances is systemic therapy of soft-tissue sarcomas have been hampered by their biologic heterogeneity, this diversity also serves as fertile ground for discovery and validation of targetable molecular drivers. The most notable success in this regard has been the development of small molecule therapies for gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Other targets of recent interest include mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) in dedifferentiated liposarcoma and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. Molecular therapies that have shown activity in diverse sarcoma populations include mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-R) inhibitors. Among the latter, pazopanib demonstrated a progression-free survival over placebo in prior-treated patients with advanced sarcoma, and is now approved for use in the sarcomas in many countries.

Although there was no evidence for major gene rearrangements, gene amplification was detected in 4 of 35 (11.4 %) primary tumours including MPNST (n=2), rhabdomyosarcoma (n=2). A total of 33 cases were examined for both p53 mutations and mdm2 amplification. Seven of the tumours were positive for p53 mutations, while five were positive for mdm2 amplification. With the exception of one case, a reciprocal relationship between the presence of a p53 mutation and mdm2 gene amplification was demonstrated.",

In this study, we evaluated the effects of selinexor in several preclinical models of various sarcoma subtypes. The efficacy of selinexor was investigated in vitro and in vivo using 17 cell lines and 9 sarcoma xenograft models including gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), liposarcoma (LPS), leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, undifferentiated sarcomas, and alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS). Most sarcoma cell lines were sensitive to selinexor with IC50s ranging from 28.8 nM to 218.2 nM (median: 66.1 nM). Selinexor suppressed sarcoma tumor xenograft growth, including models of ASPS that were resistant in vitro. In GIST cells with KIT mutations, selinexor induced G1- arrest without attenuation of phosphorylation of KIT, AKT, or MAPK, in contrast to imatinib. In LPS cell lines with MDM2 and CDK4 amplification, selinexor induced G1-arrest and apoptosis irrespective of p53 expression or mutation and irrespective of RB expression. Selinexor increased p53 and p21 expression at the protein but not RNA level, indicating a post-transcriptional effect. These results indicate that selinexor has potent in vitro and in vivo activity against a wide variety of sarcoma models by inducing G1-arrest independent of known molecular mechanisms in GIST and LPS. These studies further justify the exploration of selinexor in clinical trials targeting various sarcoma subtypes. ",

We report here a pathologic and genetic analysis of three cases of DDLs with rhabdomyosarcomatous areas.

An ultrastructural examination demonstrated rhabdomyoblasts with abundant cytoplasm containing thin and thick filaments and Z-bands. By real-time PCR, amplification of mdm2 and cdk4 was confirmed in both well-differentiated and dedifferentiated areas with rhabdomyoblasts of all cases. To our knowledge, only seven cases of DDLs with rhabdomyosarcomatous components have been reported, and furthermore, the genetic profiles of the rhabdomyosarcomatous components in DDLs have not been investigated.

A cohort of 211 soft tissue sarcomas from adults that were both clinically and pathologically well characterized was analyzed.

        "Doc_abstract":"Purpose. MDM2 is an oncogene whose protein product may promote tumorigenesis by blocking wild-type p53 tumor suppressor mediated G (0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest, thereby inhibiting repair of damaged DNA prior to cell division. While MDM2 DNA amplification is frequently observed in human sarcoma, the mechanisms linking this amplification to MDM2 oncoprotein over-production as well as its functional significance have not been well characterized in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.Methods. A tissue bank of resected soft tissue sarcomas and autologous normal tissues was assembled; all specimens were snap frozen within 15 min of resection. DNA and RNA were extracted from tissues using isoamyl alcohol and phenol chloroform extraction methods, respectively; cell lysates were prepared using PBSTDS lysis buffer. DNA and mRNA were confirmed as being non-degraded and were then examined for MDM2 DNA amplification (Southern blots) and mRNA over-expression (Northern blots) using actin (DNA) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mRNA) as loading controls. The MDM2 protein was examined on Western blots using the MDM2-specific monoclonal antibody IF2 (Oncogene Science, Inc). The presence of p53 DNA and expression of p53 mRNA was examined by rehybridizing the Southern and Northern filters using a p53-specific cDNA probe.Results. Soft tissue sarcomas and autologous normal tissues were screened for MDM2 DNA amplification, which was detected in 10 of 30 tumors screened. After screening, there was sufficient biomaterials from six specimens for subsequent Northern and Western analysis to see whether MDM2 gene amplification correlated with over-expression of MDM2 mRNA and MDM2 protein. In addition, we examined whether other mechanisms may lead to over-expression of the MDM2 oncoprotein. Several possible mechanisms of MDM2 oncoprotein over-expression were identified. These most commonly included MDM2 DNA amplification, MDM2 mRNA over-expression and MDM2 oncoprotein over-expression. However, some soft tissue sarcoma patient specimens had no evidence of MDM2 mRNA over-expression yet had MDM2 oncoprotein over-production in the tumor relative to autologous normal tissue, implying possible post-transcriptional regulation. Of functional relevance, MDM2 oncoprotein over-production by tumors was associated with large decreases in the percentage of cells in the (0)/G(1) cell cycle interface compared with autologous normal tissue cells.Discussion. It is likely that there are multiple mechanisms underlying human soft tissue sarcoma MDM2 oncoprotein over-production. Consequently, strategies that decrease MDM2 over-production, such as transcriptional repression to inhibit MDM2 promoter activity or RNA antisense approaches, may ultimately offer the best therapeutic efficacy.",

Therefore, we analyzed samples of human soft tissue sarcomas to determine the status of the chromosomal region 12q14-15, which contains the MDM2 gene encoding the well-known counterpart of the tumor suppressor p53. In addition, we determined whether an amplified MDM2 gene was present in the samples. Of the 88 soft tissue sarcoma samples, 24 (27%) showed evidence of loss of heterozygosity of markers representing 12q14-15, and 12 (14%) showed evidence of microsatellite instability. Of the 72 samples analyzed by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction, 15 (21%) possessed an amplified MDM2 gene. Loss of heterozygosity (P =.008) and microsatellite instability (P =.035) were significantly more common in Stage I tumors than in higher stage tumors. This result indicated that these alterations occur early in soft tissue sarcoma progression and possibly define a subgroup of soft tissue sarcoma. Surprisingly, MDM2 amplification in soft tissue sarcoma patients was associated with a prognosis better than that of patients without the amplification; however, this difference was not statistically significant (P =.6). Furthermore, of the tumors with an MDM2 amplification, 40% (6/15) also experienced loss of heterozygosity at 12q14-15; in contrast, only 16% of tumors without an MDM2 amplification (9/57) underwent a loss of heterozygosity.

In 86 primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities (RO-resected, T1/2 N0 M0), Mdm2 and p53 overexpression were investigated by immunohistochemistry. The results were adjusted to clinico-pathological characteristics and evaluated for their prognostic relevance by multivariate analysis. In Cox's multivariate analysis with stratification of Mdm2 to p53 results, we determined four groups which had different prognostic values for relapse-free and overall survival (Mdm2-/p53- < Mdm2-/p53+ < Mdm2+/p53- < Mdm2+/p53+). The most striking finding was a relative risk (rr) for overall survival of 18.77 (P=0.006) for patients with Mdm2/p53 co-overexpression (n=40). It is noticeably higher than the additive risk from both factors.

It is also reported that the CDK4 gene is coamplified with other sequences in the 12q13-15 region, including the MDM2 and SAS genes. Using 146 DNA samples derived from a variety of bone and soft tissue tumors, we have studied the pattern of amplification of these three genes, CDK4, MDM2, and SAS, to investigate whether there are any tumor type specific patterns of amplification. Amplification of at least one of these three genes was found in 18 tumors, and five different patterns of amplification were observed. Amplification of all of these three genes was detected in 9 cases. Amplification of the CDK4 gene without MDM2 amplification was observed in osteosarcomas and a chondrosarcoma but not in soft tissue tumors, whereas amplification of MDM2 gene alone was observed in malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFHs), liposarcomas, and lipomas, but not in bone tumors. These results suggested that the CDK4 region is the primary target for amplification in bone tumors, whereas the MDM2 region is in soft tissue tumors. We also investigated the relationship of CDK4 amplification with retinoblastoma (RB) gene mutations in osteosarcomas, for which we have already performed the mutation analyses in detail. Interestingly, contrary to the prevailing theory that CDK4 amplification is an alternative mechanism for RB gene mutation, we found that three of four cases with amplification of the CDK4 gene showed loss of expression of the RB protein, one of which was proved to have an gross DNA alteration in the RB locus. This redundancy of mutations may indicate that the amplification of CDK4 may have some roles other than the inactivation of the RB protein in the development of osteosarcomas.",

A minority additionally features myogenic, osteo- or chondrosarcomatous heterologous differentiation. Genomic amplification of the Mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) locus is characteristic for well differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Detection of MDM2 amplification may supplement histopathology and aid to distinguish liposarcoma from other soft tissue neoplasia.;Here we present two cases of dedifferentiated liposarcoma with challenging presentation. Case 1 features a myogenic component. As the tumour infiltrated the abdominal muscles and showed immunohistochemical expression of myogenic proteins, rhabdomyosarcoma had to be ruled out. Case 2 has an osteosarcomatous component resembling extraosseous osteosarcoma. The MDM2 status was determined in both cases and helped making the correct diagnosis. Overexpression of MDM2 and co-overexpression of Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 is demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. The underlying MDM2 amplification is shown by fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Since low grade osteosarcoma may also harbour MDM2 amplification it is emphasised that the amplification has to be present in the lipomatous parts of the tumour to distinguish liposarcoma from extraosseous osteosarcoma.;The two cases exemplify challenges in the diagnoses of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Liposarcoma often has pleomorphic histology and additionally may feature heterologous components that mimic other soft tissue neoplasms. Amplification of MDM2 is characteristic for well differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Determination of the MDM2 status by in situ hybridisation may assist histopathology and help to rule out differential diagnoses.",

In the absence of a lipogenic component histologically, the differential diagnosis of a retroperitoneal DDL includes other sarcomas and, if the tumor has visceral involvement, sarcomatoid carcinoma. DDL demonstrates amplification of chromosome subregion 12q13-q15. Detection of the amplification itself, or the resulting overexpression of the MDM2 and CDK4 genes by genetic and immunohistochemical methods, is a useful ancillary test in the diagnosis of DDL. More recently, immunohistochemistry for p16, the product of the CDKN2A gene, was shown to be a useful adjunct in differentiating well-differentiated liposarcoma from benign adipocytic tumors. In the present study, we examined the utility of p16 immunohistochemistry to distinguish DDL (n=44) from other high-grade and low-grade retroperitoneal mimics (n=73). p16 positivity was observed in 43/44 (98%) DDLs, with the majority of these showing strong, diffuse, staining. The rate of p16 positivity in other retroperitoneal tumors was lower (37/73, 51%) and staining was not as consistently diffuse or intense. Furthermore, p16 positivity varied between the control sarcomas based on tumor type as follows: 11/11 leiomyosarcomas, 8/11 pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcomas, 9/39 sarcomatoid carcinomas, 7/7 desmoid tumors, 1/3 endometrial stromal sarcomas, and 1/2 malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that p16 is highly sensitive for retroperitoneal DDL.

All 30 clinical specimens had been confirmed to contain sufficient ES/PNET DNA by the demonstration of a rearrangement of the t(11;22)-associated EWS gene using an EWS cDNA probe on the same blots. MDM2 gene amplification was detected in 3 of 30 specimens (10 per cent), including two ES and one PNET, but in neither of the cell lines. The three cases with amplification were morphologically typical primary tumours. Two of the three cases also showed co-amplification of the CDK4 gene, which encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase and also maps to band 12q13. Clinically, all three cases had metastatic disease at diagnosis, compared with only 1 of 15 MDM2-negative cases where the primary tumour was studied.

The methods applied encompass immunohistochemistry on 198 tumor samples using p53 antibodies (DO-1 and DO-7) and an mdm2 antibody (IF-2). Out of these, 100 samples were subjected to non-radioactive PCR-SSCP-sequencing analysis. Immunohistochemical detection rate for p53 (range of 57% to 67%) and for mdm2 proteins (range of 19 to 44%) was similar in all 3 groups. In higher tumor grades, an increased rate of immunopositivity was found for p53 but not for mdm2. Investigation of p53 mutational status revealed 6 mutations in myogenic sarcomas but none in malignant neural tumors or fibrosarcomas, suggesting different roles of p53 in the 3 STS groups. Interestingly, a G-->A transition in codon 245 (a CpG site) was found in 3 myogenic sarcomas.

We analyzed the morphologic spectrum of DDL of the spermatic cord and its clinical significance in 42 patients from 1990 to 2014. The median age of the patients was 70.5 years (range: 43 to 90 y). The median tumor size was 10.9 cm (range: 3 to 30 cm). Six cases were low-grade DDL, 28 were high-grade DDL, and in 8 cases both coexisted. Five cases had osteosarcoma, and 2 had leiomyosarcoma differentiation. Low-grade DDL had a fibrosarcoma-like (n=11), myxofibrosarcoma-like (n=2), and fibrosarcoma and inflammatory-like (n=1) pattern. High-grade DDL had a fibrosarcoma-like (n=22), undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma-like (n=7), myxofibrosarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma-like (n=4), fibrosarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma-like (n=2), and myxofibrosarcoma-like (n=1) pattern. Resection margins were positive in 22, negative in 13, and unknown in 7 cases. MDM2 was positive in 24/24 cases. Two patients received neoadjuvant radiotherapy (1 with chemotherapy). Patients received postoperative radiation (n=13), reexcision (n=5) with radiation (n=3), chemotherapy (n=2), chemotherapy and radiation (n=1), no therapy (n=11), and unknown (n=6). Follow-up information was available in 31 patients (mean: 54.2 mo; median: 38.5 mo; range: 2 to 180 mo). Seven patients developed local recurrence. Two patients had systemic metastases and succumbed to disease. Recurrence developed at an average of 40.9 months (median: 24 mo; range: 12 to 100 mo) after resection. Average follow-up in patients without recurrence was 45.2 months (median: 25 mo; range: 2 to 180 mo) (P=0.87). Margin status, size, and grade did not correlate with recurrence (P>0.05).

Metaphase cytogenetic and FISH analyses were also performed on one inflammatory MFH. Histological review showed areas of well-differentiated liposarcoma in nine inflammatory MFHs. CGH analysis showed 12q13-15 amplification or gain in six of seven inflammatory MFHs and in seven of seven dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity of tumour cells for MDM2 in every tumour in both groups and for CDK4 in ten and seven inflammatory MFHs and dedifferentiated liposarcomas, respectively.

While targeted therapy based on tyrosine kinase inhibition such as imatinib and second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors plays an important role in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), some progress was also achieved in non-GIST sarcomas. Targeting the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway has been shown to be clinically promising in a diversity of different sarcoma subtypes, and inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor pathway is of special interest in vascular sarcoma subtypes.

We have therefore investigated the molecular response to Nutlin treatment in several liposarcoma cell lines with such markers, as well as a panel of other sarcoma cell lines. We report that Nutlin efficiently stabilized p53 and induced downstream p53 dependent transcription and apoptosis in liposarcoma cells with amplified MDM2 in vitro. Some effect of Nutlin was also observed on cell lines without amplified MDM2 but with wt TP53, but no apoptosis was induced. The MDM4 protein, reported to interfere with the reactivation of p53, was undetectable in cells with amplified MDM2. Thus, Nutlin represents a promising new therapeutic principle for the treatment of an increasing group of sarcomas.",

Especially malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) reveals a reduced ifosfamide (IF) chemosensitivity when compared to other sarcoma entities. This is the first study to analyze MFH cells for the effects of IF on the expression of the pathways P16-CDK4-Rb and P14ARF-MDM2-P73 regulating cell cycle. The aim was to identify candidate genes possibly involved in the anti-apoptotic response of p53-deficient MFH cells during chemotherapy. PCR, real-time RT-PCR and confocal laser scanning microscopy were applied on primary cultures of MFH cells containing defective p53 genes. The cultures were treated with different concentrations of IF. A non-treated MFH culture served as negative control. A threshold concentration of IF (100 microM) was determined sparing the majority of the cells (99%), whereas higher IF quantities caused complete apoptosis. Data collected over a period of 48 h showed that the MFH cells surviving 100 microM IF overexpressed the kinase gene CDK4 and oncogene MDM2 by a factor of 63. A similar strong increase was observed at the protein level for both proteins. In contrast, the other proteins analyzed were not detectable. Additionally, the MFH cells induced complex patterns of MDM2 mRNA splicing and an abnormal mRNA transcript carrying a novel MDM2 missense mutation. These effects were neither observed in the non-treated culture nor in cultures completely inducing spontaneous apoptosis. Therefore, we speculate that the induction of the gene CDK4, and especially of MDM2, is involved in anti-apoptotic mechanisms of p53-negative MFH cells tolerating IF in vitro. Further experiments are necessary to test whether the novel candidate genes favor development of chemoresistance and whether MDM2 mRNA splicing variants contribute to this process in vivo.",

The intervals between radiation therapy and diagnosis of secondary sarcomas ranged from 3 to 17 years.;Mdm2 expression was more common in de novo sarcomas than RISs (75% vs 37.5%), and p53 expression was more common in RISs than in de novo cases (75% vs 37.5%).

Variable immunoprofiles observed in both groups did not correlate with tumor types, except that all of 2 myxofibrosarcomas were Mdm2(+)/p53(+).;In conclusion, we speculated that both radiation-induced and de novo sarcomagenesis are not due to a unique genetic mechanism.

While liposarcoma classification in dogs is based solely on histology, in humans it depends on the detection of genetic abnormalities that can lead to specific protein overexpression. This study is an immunohistochemical evaluation of MDM2 and CDK4 expression in canine liposarcoma designed to assess the correlation of these proteins with histologic type, grade, mitotic index and Ki67 labeling index and evaluate their utility in improving tumor classification. Fifty-three liposarcomas were retrospectively collected: 24 were well differentiated liposarcomas (WDL), 16 of which expressed MDM2 and 21 CDK4; 7 were myxoid liposarcomas (ML), 1 of which expressed MDM2 and 5 expressed CDK4; 18 were pleomorphic liposarcomas (PL), all were MDM2 negative and 12 expressed CDK4. Four tumors were morphologically consistent with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL) a subtype described only in humans: 3 expressed MDM2 and 4 expressed CDK4. MDM2 expression correlated with histotype (highly expressed in WDL and DDL) and grade (highly expressed in grade 1 tumors). Histotype correlated with the Ki67 labeling index (lowest in WDL and highest in DDL). A revised classification, considering MDM2 expression, allowed 8 WDL to be reclassified as PL and correlated significantly with mitotic and Ki67 labeling index (both significantly lower in WDL and progressively higher in ML and DDL). These results partially parallel data reported for human liposarcomas, suggesting that WDL and DDL are distinct neoplastic entities characterized by MDM2 expression, which may represent a useful diagnostic and potentially prognostic marker for canine liposarcoma.

Cytogenetics in these tumors has identified ring and giant chromosomes composed of 12q13-15 amplicons including the MDM2 gene. Identifying MDM2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization may prove an adjunctive tool in the diagnosis of lipomatous neoplasms. Dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization employing a laboratory-developed BAC label probe cocktail specific for MDM2 (12q15) and a probe for the centromeric region of chromosome 12 (Abbott Molecular, DesPlaines, IL) was performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue including whole sections from atypical lipomatous tumors (n=13), dedifferentiated liposarcomas (n=14), benign lipomatous tumors (n=30), and pleomorphic sarcoma, not otherwise specified (n=10), and a tissue microarray containing a variety of high-grade sarcomas (n=63). An MDM2/chromosome 12 ratio >or=2.0 was considered amplified, <2.0 nonamplified, and cases displaying >2 signals of both probes and an MDM2 ratio <2.0 polysomic for chromosome 12. Of the well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas, 100% showed amplification of MDM2. Chromosome 12 polysomy was noted in 89% of spindle cell/pleomorphic lipomas, while all angiolipomas and lipomas were nonamplified and eusomic. MDM2 amplification was observed in 40% of pleomorphic sarcomas and a small subset of high-grade sarcomas (3/63). MDM2/chromosome 12 fluorescence in situ hybridization is a sensitive and specific tool (both 100%) in evaluating low-grade lipomatous neoplasms. The specificity decreases in high-grade sarcomas, as MDM2 amplification was observed in a small portion of pleomorphic sarcomas and high-grade sarcomas other than dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Importantly, none of the benign lipomatous lesions were MDM2 amplified and even cells in areas of well-differentiated liposarcomas with minimal cytologic atypia were amplified, making the probe a valuable tool in the diagnosis of even limited biopsy samples of well-differentiated lipomatous neoplasms.",

In this study, we sought to determine the utility of MDM2 amplification for the separation of benign (schwannomas) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs).

Assessments were also made for cellularity (low or high), percentage of cells staining positively for p53 and MDM2 protein, and percentage of cells staining with MIB-1.;Of 15 MPNSTs, 3 (20%) demonstrated amplification of the MDM2 gene. No neurofibromas or schwannomas demonstrated MDM2 amplification. All 3 MDM2 -amplified MPNSTs were positive for p53.

The search for a MDM2 amplification, reflecting the presence of an amplicon in the 12q region, is a sensitive and specific tool for the diagnosis of atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas and dedifferentiated iposarcomas. The presence and the type of KITor PDGFRA activating mutation guide the diagnosis and treatment of GIST. Certain molecular abnormalities are found in several tumour types, emphasizing the importance of integrating the results of any molecular study within the morphological and immunohistochemical context: In France, sarcoma diagnosis is structured around a reference network (RRePS) that provides every pathologist an access to these molecular analysis tools.",

We have applied this technique to detect and map amplified regions in 54 soft tissue sarcomas. Aberrations were detected by visual analysis of hybridizations or contrast-enhanced digital images, followed by quantitative digital ratio imaging of the aberrant chromosomes. Several tumors showed increased DNA sequence copy number at 12q14, as expected. However, CGH analysis detected amplification of 12q14 also in some tumors where neither MDM2 nor CDK4 was amplified, suggesting that another as yet unknown gene(s) may drive amplification of this region in sarcomas. Furthermore, a novel recurring amplicon was detected at 1q21-q22. DNA amplifications coinciding with this segment were as frequent as those observed for 12q14, indicating that 1q21-q22-linked gene(s) may also play an important role in the development and/or progression of human soft tissue sarcomas.",

In about 5% cases, the dedifferentiated component is an heterologous sarcoma such as leiomyosarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma. We reviewed a series of 65 sarcomas with a myogenic differentiation developed in the internal trunk for which initial diagnoses were leiomyosarcoma (37), rhabdomyosarcoma (6), malignant mesenchymoma (6), and DLPS (16). Immunostainings for MDM2, CDK4, alpha smooth actin, desmin, caldesmon, myogenin, c-kit, and progesterone receptor were performed. In 48 cases, the amplification status of MDM2 and CDK4 could be evaluated with quantitative polymerase chain reaction on paraffin-embedded tissues extracted DNAs. After review of the cases, final diagnoses were leiomyosarcoma (35), rhabdomyosarcomatous (20) or leiomyosarcomatous (7) DLPS, probable DLPS (2), and malignant mesenchymoma (1). DLPS were bigger tumors (median: 18.2 cm) than leiomyosarcomas (median: 12 cm). They had a lower 5-year recurrence-free survival than leiomyosarcomas (45% vs. 71%) but a higher 5-year metastasis-free survival (73% vs. 39%). There was no significant difference in overall survival (57% vs. 34%). Outcome of patients with a DLPS with a myosarcomatous component did not differ from conventional DLPS. In conclusion, most sarcomas with a rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation occurring in the internal trunk of adults are DLPS. Moreover, DLPS with a myogenic component have a low metastatic potential, similar to conventional DLPS and significantly lower to the metastatic potential of leiomyosarcomas.",

Although overexpression of these protooncogenes might inhibit growth regulation through the TP53- and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB)-mediated pathways, neither gene was included consistently in all of the amplicons observed in our sarcoma panel. It was unclear whether both of these genes were selected for during amplification. Furthermore, in some samples without amplification of MDM2 or CDK4, comparative genomic hybridization showed amplification in the 12q13-15 region, suggesting that another selection mechanism might also be involved. To investigate the possibility that another target gene, which may be located between CDK4 and MDM2, could be the driving force, we characterized the involvement of 17 loci from this region in 12q13-15 amplicons that were detected previously in 21 sarcoma samples. The results showed discrete amplicons around MDM2 and CDK4 with reduced amplification of the intervening sequences. This suggests that there is separate selection for amplification of the two genes, and it makes the possibility of a common selective gene unlikely. Furthermore, D12S8, localized distal to MDM2, was amplified almost as frequently as MDM2 and was also amplified in one of the samples without MDM2 or CDK4 amplification. The data suggest that amplification of at least three different regions within the 12q13-15 segment may be selected for in tumor cells involving MDM2, CDK4, or a more distally located gene, possibly near D12S8.",

Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on DNA samples from 29 LMS, 9 ARMS, 7 anaplastic ERMS and 6 classic ERMS. Alteration of one or more of the 12q13-15 genes was revealed in 13/29 LMS (45%) and 12/22 RMS (54%) including 5/9 ARMS (56%), 5/7 anaplastic ERMS (71%) and 2/6 classic ERMS (33%). The potential importance of overproduction of protein products in neoplastic development, led us also to study a possible high expression of cdk4, mdm2 and gli proteins in immunohistochemical staining experiments on paraffin-embedded tissue samples of the same cases. Among LMS and RMS most cases with CDK4, MDM2 and GLI gene alterations also showed a simultaneous high expression of the relative protein. In summary, these results indicate that amplification or overerepresentation of genes at 12q13-15 region involve both LMS and RMS. Moreover these genes alterations reveal predominantly in the alveolar and in the anaplastic variant of the embryonal subtype. These two seem to have a more similar behavior than anaplastic and classic embryonal that are classified in the same subtype.",

Liposarcoma, a type of soft tissue sarcoma in adults, account for approximately 20% of all adult soft tissue sarcomas. There are no effective chemotherapies for majority of these tumors. Efforts made to define the molecular basis of liposarcomas lead to the finding that besides the amplifications of CDK4 and MDM2, Aurora Kinase A, also was shown to be overexpressed. Based on these as well as mathematic modeling, we have carried out a successful preclinical study using CDK4 and IGF1R inhibitors in liposarcoma. MLN8237 has been shown to be a potent and selective inhibitor of Aurora A. MLN-8237, as per our results, induces a differential inhibition of Aurora A and B in a dose dependent manner. At a low nanomolar dose, cellular effects such as induction of phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10) mimicked as that of the inhibition of Aurora kinase A followed by apoptosis. However, micromolar dose of MLN-8237 induced polyploidy, a hallmark effect of Aurora B inhibition. The dose dependent selectivity of inhibition was further confirmed by using siRNA specific inhibition of Aurora A and B. This was further tested by time lapse microscopy of GFP-H2B labelled cells treated with MLN-8237. LS141 xenograft model at a dose of 30 mg/kg also showed efficient growth suppression by selective inhibition of Aurora Kinase A. Based on our data, a dose that can target only Aurora A will be more beneficial in tumor suppression. ",

MDM2 is a strong candidate for one such cellular protein; the MDM2 gene was originally identified by virtue of its amplification in a spontaneously transformed derivative of mouse BALB/c cells and the MDM2 protein subsequently shown to bind to p53 in rat cells transfected with p53 genes. To determine whether MDM2 plays a role in human cancer, we have cloned the human MDM2 gene. Here we show that recombinant-derived human MDM2 protein binds human p53 in vitro, and we use MDM2 clones to localize the human MDM2 gene to chromosome 12q13-14. Because this chromosomal position appears to be altered in many sarcomas, we looked for changes in human MDM2 in such cancers. The gene was amplified in over a third of 47 sarcomas, including common bone and soft tissue forms. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that MDM2 binds to p53, and that amplification of MDM2 in sarcomas leads to escape from p53-regulated growth control. This mechanism of tumorigenesis parallels that for virally-induced tumours, in which viral oncogene products bind to and functionally inactivate p53.",

Both cases positive for MDM2 amplification showed MDM2 expression by immunohistochemistry. At last follow-up, both patients had died of disease (19 and 60 mo).

In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the sensitivity of sarcomas to Nutlin-3a. In an ex vivo tissue explant system, we found that TP53 pathway alterations (TP53 status, MDM2/MDM4 genomic amplification/mRNA overexpression, MDM2 SNP309, and TP53 SNP72) did not confer apoptotic or cytostatic responses in sarcoma tissue biopsies (n = 24). Unexpectedly, MDM2 status did not predict Nutlin-3a sensitivity. RNA sequencing revealed that the global transcriptomic profiles of these sarcomas provided a more robust prediction of apoptotic responses to Nutlin-3a. Expression profiling revealed a subset of TP53 target genes that were transactivated specifically in sarcomas that were highly sensitive to Nutlin-3a. Of these target genes, the GADD45A promoter region was shown to be hypermethylated in 82% of wild-type TP53 sarcomas that did not respond to Nutlin-3a, thereby providing mechanistic insight into the innate ability of sarcomas to resist apoptotic death following Nutlin-3a treatment. Collectively, our findings argue that the existing benchmark biomarker for MDM2 antagonist efficacy (MDM2 amplification) should not be used to predict outcome but rather global gene expression profiles and epigenetic status of sarcomas dictate their sensitivity to p53/MDM2 antagonists.",

In this study, we evaluated the expression of p53, MDM2, MIB-1 (Ki-67), p21, p27, p16, cyclin A, cyclin D1, and cyclin E by immunohistochemistry in 45 cases of myxofibrosarcoma. First, we searched for possible clinicopathologic prognostic factors in 61 cases of myxofibrosarcoma for which follow-up data were available. In univariate analysis, large tumor size (> or =5 cm), deeply situated tumor, and high histological grade (grade 2 or 3) significantly decreased survival (log-rank test, P <0.05). Among 43 cases of myxofibrosarcoma for which immunohistochemical findings were available, high MIB-1 labeling index (LI) (cutoffs of 10 and 22.5 on average), high cyclin A LI (cutoffs 10% and 13.8% on average), low p21 LI (cutoffs 10 and 20.7 on average), and reduced abnormal expression of p16 were adverse prognostic factors. In multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards model), high mitotic rate (>15/10 high-power fields), p53 immunoreactivity (cutoff 10%), high MIB-1 LI (>22.5), low p21 LI (<20.7), and low p27 LI (<47.8 on average) were independent poor prognostic factors. Our results suggest that reduced expression of p21 could be considered a new parameter to be evaluated, along with classical clinicopathologic prognostic factors, for identifying those at high risk for myxofibrosarcoma.",

It was originally recognized as a variant of epitheloid sarcoma, however it is now concluded as a distinctive, rarely metastasizing endothelial neoplasm. We present a case of pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma in the lower limb in a 49-year-old female who has a long course of disease and suffered from twice local recurrences and lymph node affection of the tumor. The mass was subcutaneous and the margins were ill-defined. Morphologically, the tumor cells show diversity, composed of large spindle cells and round cells, both with abundant eocinophilic cytoplasm, mimicking rhybdomyoplasts and epitheloid cells respectively. The tumor cells show diffuse strong expression of Factor VIII, Fli-1, INI-1, vimentin, MDM2, and CDK4, local expression of CD31, AE1/AE3, EMA and P63, and no expression of CD34, S-100, actin-sm, desmin, MyoD1, and HMB45. Based on these information, this case is diagnosed as pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma after ruling out the main differential diagnosises including epithelioid sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma. From this case we suggest that pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma may be confused with a variety of soft tissue neoplasm histologically. The clinical feature of the case of a long course of disease with twice local recurrences and final lymph node involvement 10 years after excision of the primary tumor indicates a relative indolent behavior of this tumor.

A large proportion of sarcomas are associated with specific molecular genetic lesions such as translocations, mutations, and amplifications, which are helpful in the diagnosis of individual cases. However, the exact impact of molecular genetics on the final diagnosis of sarcomas is unknown. In this study, all soft tissue and visceral sarcomas arising in patients living in 3 European regions in 2 countries (representing 13 million inhabitants) were collected and reviewed during 2 consecutive years. A molecular analysis was performed for all suspicions of sarcomas with specific genetic lesions [mutations of KIT/PDGFRA in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), reciprocal translocation, or amplification of MDM2 in atypical lipomatous tumors, well-differentiated liposarcoma-dedifferentiated liposarcoma (ALT/WDLPS-DDLPS)]. To evaluate the impact of molecular tests, a premolecular analysis diagnosis was proposed with 3 categories of certainty: certain, probable, or possible. A molecular analysis was performed in 763/1484 tumors corresponding to 295 cases in which GIST was suspected, 248 sarcomas with a suspicion of translocation, and 220 cases in which ALT/WDLPS-DDLPS was suspected. Molecular analysis was found to be useful (confirms a probable diagnosis) in 11 (4%) GISTs, 62 (26%) suspicions of translocation, and 66 (31%) suspicions of ALT/WDLPS-DDLPS; and necessary (allows a possible diagnosis) in 2 (<1%) GISTs, 31 (12%) suspicions of translocation, and 19 (9%) suspicions of ALT/WDLPS-DDLPS. This study performed in an epidemiological setting demonstrates the significant impact of molecular analysis on the final sarcoma diagnosis and favors such an analysis on any tumor with a suspicion of a specific genomic abnormality and for which the diagnosis is uncertain.

ALT/WDLSs and DDLSs are often difficult to distinguish from other tumors with similar morphological characteristics. In this study, we investigated whether the detection of amplified or overexpressed murine double-minute 2 (MDM2) can be a useful diagnostic ancillary aid. We used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect MDM2 amplification and protein overexpression, respectively, in 49 WDLSs, 5 DDLSs, 23 myxoid liposarcomas, 25 benign lipomatous tumors, and 75 spindle and pleomorphic sarcomas. MDM2 amplification was detected in 48 of 49 WDLSs, 5 of 5 DDLSs, 2 of 9 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and 2 of 10 myxofibrosarcomas. We did not detect MDM2 amplification in any of the benign lipomatous tumors. FISH-mediated detection of MDM2 amplification was the most valuable diagnostic aid for ALT/WDLS, as determined by using the Fisher exact test to compare two different diagnoses of 19 biopsies. On the contrary, unequivocal nuclear overexpression of MDM2 was found in only 10 of 50 ALT/WDLSs. The sensitivity and specificity of MDM2 amplification in distinguishing a DDLS from spindle and pleomorphic sarcomas were 100% and 95%, respectively, while those of MDM2 overexpression were 100% and 87%, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate that FISH-mediated detection of MDM2 amplification is the most useful adjunct in the diagnosis of both ALT/WDLS and DDLS.

Artificial amplification of mdm2 gene derived from a transformed murine cell line enhances tumorigenic potential of murine cells. Consistent with its tumorigenic property, mouse or human MDM2 can inactivate several functions of the tumor suppressor p53 and can degrade p53. The protein also interacts with other tumor suppressors, and these interactions may contribute to its tumorigenic property. In spite of its oncogenic role, mouse or human MDM2 induces G(1) arrest in normal human or murine cells. Some cell lines bearing known genetic mutations are insensitive to MDM2-mediated growth arrest. This review is aimed to collect available information on the functions of MDM2 that could potentially regulate cell cycle and to discuss how this information may fit in one model that could explain the two apparently opposite G(1) arrest and oncogenic function of MDM2.",

In a uterine leiomyoma and a myxoid liposarcoma with translocations 12;14 and 12;16, the breakpoints in chromosome 12 could be localized to the HMGIC and CHOP regions, respectively.

Conventional CGH revealed gains or amplifications of 12q13-q15 in six sarcomas and in two adrenocortical carcinomas. Using microarrays, we demonstrated that, among genes located on 12q13-q15, SAS/CDK4 were amplified in six sarcomas, and MDM2 and GLI in five and four sarcomas, respectively. The two adrenocortical tumors showed coamplifications of SAS/CDK4 and MDM2. Furthermore, PDGFRA (located on 4q12) amplification was identified in five sarcomas. Our data demonstrate: (1) amplifications of SAS/CDK4, MDM2, GLI, and PDGFRA are strongly associated with the tumorigenesis of pulmonary artery intimal sarcomas, whereas SAS/CDK4 and MDM2 coamplification may contribute to the progression of adrenocortical tumors; (2) microarray-based CGH is a useful tool for simultaneous detection of multiple gene amplifications, with a high sensitivity and resolution compared to that of conventional CGH.",

To investigate further a possible role of the two genes in sarcomas, 24 large and deep-seated lipomas and 74 liposarcomas of various subtypes were analysed for mdm2 and p53 overexpression by immunocytochemistry. Nineteen cases of the same series were also molecularly analysed for both MDM2 gene amplification and TP53 mutations, and a further ten cases for non-random chromosomal abnormalities. In the retroperitoneal well-differentiated-dedifferentiated (WD-DD) group, 15/16 WD and 8/8 DD liposarcomas displayed the mdm2+/p53+ phenotype, consistent with MDM2 gene amplification in the absence of TP53 mutations. In the non-retroperitoneal WD-DD group, 5/11 WD liposarcomas also retained the mdm2+/p53+ phenotype whereas all DD liposarcomas showed an immunophenotype and, when assessed, a genotype consistent with mutant TP53. Null mdm2 immunophenotype, coupled with evidence of a specific chromosome translocation t(12;16), was constantly observed in both the usual and the cellular subtypes of myxoid liposarcoma, three cases of which also showed TP53 alterations at the genetic or protein level. Neither mdm2 nor p53 overexpression was observed in the lipomas. The results show the existence of three main pathogenetically distinct groups of liposarcoma. The first retroperitoneal WD-DD group, which represents a novel class of tumours within a single histological category of sarcoma, where MDM2-mediated inactivation of p53 could be related to the pathogenetic mechanism. The second is the non-retroperitoneal WD-DD group, where the TP53 mutations appear to correlate with the dedifferentiation process. The third is the myxoid group, which is characterized by its own unique cytogenetic profile and never shows any involvement of TP53 or MDM2 genes. As for diagnostic significance, the absence of mdm2 and p53 reactivity in lipomas seems to represent a useful marker for differential diagnosis from lipoma-like WD liposarcomas.",

Overexpression of the MDM2 protein is associated with a poorer prognosis for STS patients. An MDM2 antisense approach to reduce MDM2 protein levels has been successfully applied on several carcinomas in vitro and used on a few in vivo cases. However, antisense treatment not only resulted in an MDM2 protein reduction but also in a wild-type P53 gene (wt-P53) mediated tumor growth suppression due to its genetic wt-P53 status. In this study, we used a clinically relevant xenotransplanted STS model with a mutated P53 gene (mt-P53) in order to exclude the influence of wt-P53. The human STSs were surgically implanted and one week later osmotic pumps were implanted intraperitoneally into nude rats releasing MDM2-antisense ODNs (AS ODNs) continuously for one week. As controls MDM2-sense ODN (SE ODN) or a 0.9% NaCl solution (saline solution) were administered. After one week animals treated with MDM2-AS ODN (100 or 200 microg) showed a reduction in tumor mass in comparison to animals treated with MDM2-SE ODN. The reduction in tumor mass was significant in animals treated with MDM2-AS ODNs in comparison to the saline solution treated ones (p=0.018 or p=0.007). Furthermore, a significant reduction in macroscopically visible tumor number with MDM2-AS ODN treatments (100 or 200 microg) in comparison to MDM2-SE ODN or saline solution treatment (both p=0.009) was observed for the first time. As expected a reduction in MDM2 protein expression in the MDM2-AS ODN treated tumors when compared to the MDM2-SE ODN or saline solution treated tumors was detected in Western blot analyses and immunohistochemically. In addition, an unexpected reduction in mt-P53 protein expression after AS ODN therapy was also observed. In short, we have demonstrated in vivo for the first time that MDM2-AS ODN treatment of xenotransplanted STS (mt-P53) reduces tumor mass, tumor number, MDM2 protein and mt-P53 protein expression. Our findings support the hypothesis that MDM2-AS ODN treatment may exert a tumor inhibiting effect on all MDM2 expressing tumors regardless of the P53-status, this in turn may be of general importance in gene therapy of cancer.",

However, for the MDM2 gene, over-expression of the MDM2 protein has not always been shown to accompany gene amplification, raising the possibility that amplification of genetic sequences targets alternative genes on chromosome 12q13 for over-expression. To investigate this discrepancy, we have examined 129 soft tissue tumours for amplification of the MDM2 gene using Southern analysis, and 39 of these tumours were also examined by immunohistochemical staining for MDM2 over-expression.Results. Gene amplification was identified in 14/114 (12.3%) of the malignant tumours, but was not identified in any of the benign tumours; 21/39 (54%) of the malignant tumours also demonstrated MDM2 over-expression. Within this group the MDM2 gene was over-expressed in every tumour in which the gene amplification was found, and over-expression in the absence of gene amplification was also found in an additional 10 tumours.Discussion. These data demonstrate a clear correlation between the presence of MDM2 amplification and MDM2 over-expression, and provide persuasive evidence therefore that the amplification of genetic sequences on chromosome 12q13 in soft tissue sarcomas targets the MDM2 gene for over-expression.

Histologically, liposarcomas themselves are heterogeneous and fall into four distinct subtypes: well-differentiated/atypical lipomatous tumor, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, myxoid (round cell) liposarcoma, and pleomorphic liposarcoma. Surgical resection with negative margins remains the mainstay for definitive treatment for operable disease. For unresectable disease, retrospective studies have identified myxoid (round cell) and pleomorphic sarcomas to be relatively responsive to chemotherapy. Recent studies have identified distinct genetic aberrations that not only aid in the diagnosis of particular liposarcoma subtypes, but represent actionable targets as they are considered central to disease pathogenesis. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and murine double minute 2 (MDM2) are overexpressed in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas and offer tantalizing opportunities that are being pursued in clinical trials. Myxoid (round cell) liposarcomas appear to be sensitive to trabectedin, which is currently under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review.

The p53 gene is inactivated in many human tumors either by mutations or by binding to oncogenic proteins. In some tumors, such as soft tissue sarcomas, overexpression of MDM2 inactivates an otherwise intact p53, disabling the genome integrity checkpoint and allowing cell cycle progression of defective cells. Disruption of the MDM2/p53 interaction leads to increased p53 levels and restored p53 transcriptional activity, indicating restoration of the genome integrity check and therapeutic potential for MDM2/p53 binding antagonists. Here, we show by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy that chalcones (1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-ones) are MDM2 inhibitors that bind to a subsite of the p53 binding cleft of human MDM2. Biochemical experiments showed that these compounds can disrupt the MDM2/p53 protein complex, releasing p53 from both the p53/MDM2 and DNA-bound p53/MDM2 complexes.

The expression of viral proteins capable of inactivating the p53 tumor suppressor protein has been implicated in KSHV oncogenesis. However, DNA-damaging drugs such as doxorubicin are clinically efficacious against PEL and KS, suggesting that p53 signaling remains intact despite the presence of KSHV. To investigate the functionality of p53 in PEL, we examined the response of a large number of PEL cell lines to doxorubicin. Two out of seven (29%) PEL cell lines harbored a mutant p53 allele (BCBL-1 and BCP-1) which led to doxorubicin resistance. In contrast, all other PEL containing wild-type p53 showed DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest, p53 phosphorylation, and p53 target gene activation. These data imply that p53-mediated DNA damage signaling was intact. Supporting this finding, chemical inhibition of p53 signaling in PEL led to doxorubicin resistance, and chemical activation of p53 by the Hdm2 antagonist Nutlin-3 led to unimpaired induction of p53 target genes as well as growth inhibition and apoptosis.",

Some reports have discussed the altered expression and molecular abnormalities of cell-cycle-regulatory proteins in rhabdomyosarcoma; however, variable frequencies of occurrence have been noted. In the current study, among 72 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, the authors evaluated for the expression of p53, MDM2, p16, p21/WAF1, p27, cyclin D1, cyclin E, pRb and E2F-1 protein immunohistochemically and assessed for proliferative activities using MIB-1. We also analyzed the mutation of the p53 gene in 45 cases, the amplification of the MDM2 gene in 18 cases and the mutation of the H-ras gene in 29 cases, using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded materials. Furthermore, we assessed the correlation between clinicopathologic factors and the results of both immunohistochemical and molecular analyses. Alveolar type affected older patients, and it had a significantly higher mitotic rate compared with the embryonal type (P=0.0226). p53 overexpression was detected in 22 (30.6%) of 72 cases, and 10 (22.2%) of 45 cases had p53 gene abnormalities. As for MDM2, its overexpression was found in nine (12.5%) of 72 cases, and three (16.7%) of 18 cases showed MDM2 amplification. A statistically significant association was observed between immunoreaction for MDM2 and p53 overexpression (P=0.0002), and p53 and MDM2 overexpression was significantly correlated with high MIB-1 labeling indices. E2F-1 labeling indices showed a significantly higher score in alveolar type compared with that seen in embryonal type (P=0.0334), but MIB-1 did not. In conclusion, our study suggests that p53 overexpression may be related to tumor progression because tumors with p53 overexpression have a high proliferative activity in the current study. Alveolar type had a significantly higher both mitotic rate and E2F-1 labeling indices when compared with the embryonal type. The current study is the first report of the correlation of E2F-1 with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.",

There is growing evidence that amplification and overexpression of the MDM2 gene are alternative mechanisms that also lead to functional inactivation of p53. While p53 mutations and MDM2 amplification have been reported to occur in rhabdomyosarcoma and osteogenic sarcoma, the incidence of MDM2 in other pediatric solid tumors is not known. We therefore tested a series of other pediatric solid tumors for MDM2 gene amplification. MDM2 amplification could not be detected in specimens from 40 Wilms' tumors, 15 neuroblastomas, 12 sarcomas, or 4 hepatoblastomas tested. To determine whether MDM2 amplification was an alternative mechanism of p53 inactivation in adult carcinomas that frequently possess p53 mutations, 68 samples of squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract, 24% of which were previously shown to contain p53 mutations, were also tested for MDM2 amplification. MDM2 amplification did not occur in any of the tumor specimens tested. These findings suggest that MDM2 amplification may only occur in a limited subset of human tumors. Loss of function of p53 may be an essential event in human tumorigenesis. If so, then other mechanisms of p53 inactivation must occur in those tumors that exhibit neither p53 mutation nor MDM2 amplification.",

To model these conditions in mice, we have used the entire Mdm2 gene, under transcriptional control of its native promoter region, as a transgene to create mice that overexpress Mdm2. The transgenic mice are predisposed to spontaneous tumor formation, and the incidence of sarcomas observed in the Mdm2-transgenic mice in the presence or absence of functional p53 demonstrates that, in addition to Mdm2-mediated inactivation of p53, there exists a p53-independent role for Mdm2 in tumorigenesis.",

Evidence is accumulating that these alterations frequently do not result in a complete loss of the sequence-specific transcriptional regulatory function of p53. Here, we describe the transcriptional activity of the p53 mutant C277Y isolated from a Ewing's sarcoma with high constitutive pig3 expression. Transient transfection of this mutant into a p53 null cell line resulted in activation not only of the pig3 but also of the MDM2 gene compatible with the presence of constitutively expressed MDM2 transcripts initiated from the P2 promoter in the p53-C277Y hemizygous Ewing's sarcoma cell line. Expression of endogenous pig3 and MDM2 genes was further enhanced on irradiation of this cell line. Here, suppression of p53-C277Y by RNAi reduced pig3 promoter activity, RNA, and protein expression. Reporter gene assays revealed that the potential of p53-C277Y to up-regulate MDM2 expression was similar to wild-type p53, whereas activation of the pig3 promoter was at least 5-fold increased over wild-type p53. The pentanucleotide microsatellite sequence present in exon 1 of the pig3 gene was found to be responsible for p53-C277Y-mediated activation. In concordance with a role of PIG3 protein for cell death, we showed residual apoptotic activity of p53-C277Y to which the described Ewing's sarcoma cell line was found to be resistant. p53-C277Y has previously been reported to bind to DNA with altered sequence specificity and to be unable to activate generic p53 target genes in yeast-based functional assays.

There are no current therapies effective against the aggressive, KSHV-induced PEL. Here we demonstrate that activation of the p53 pathway using murine double minute 2 (MDM2) inhibitor Nutlin-3a conveyed specific and highly potent activation of PEL cell killing. Our results demonstrated that the KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) bound to both p53 and MDM2 and that the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3a disrupted the p53-MDM2-LANA complex and selectively induced massive apoptosis in PEL cells. Together with our results indicating that KSHV-infection activated DNA damage signaling, these findings contribute to the specificity of the cytotoxic effects of Nutlin-3a in KSHV-infected cells.

One of the critical negative regulators of p53 is the MDM2 oncoprotein. Many anticancer drug development efforts in the past decade have therefore been devoted to the discovery and optimization of small molecules that selectively disrupt the interaction between MDM2 and p53, which could provide, in principle, a potent means to restore p53 function in tumor cells with wild-type p53. The nutlins are the class of selective inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction that are currently most advanced in their clinical development.

To study whether this similarity extends to the molecular level, 21 canine osteosarcomas were analyzed for alterations of p53, Rb and MDM2. MDM2 is a normal cell protein which antagonizes p53, amplification is seen in some human sarcomas. The gross structure of the p53, Rb and MDM2 genes was examined by Southern blotting. No deletions or rearrangements of the p53 or Rb genes were detected. The absence of gross gene alterations affecting these tumor suppressor genes is a significant difference between the disease in dogs and humans, since rearrangements or deletions of the p53 or Rb genes occur in 20-30 per cent of human osteosarcomas. The MDM2 gene appeared to be duplicated in one canine tumor but no cases of significant amplification were detected. Expression of normal Rb was detected in all cases. Mutations of the p53 gene were found in 38 percent of canine osteosarcomas. Analysis of mutations revealed a predominance of spontaneous mutation.

We present the case of a parosteal osteoliposarcoma made of closely intermingled components of a low-grade osteosarcoma and a WDLPS.;In a 34 year-old woman with a slowly growing mass of the arm, imaging revealed a large well-defined heterogeneous parosteal mass of the upper humerus, with two main components: bone at the base and fat at the periphery. Microscopically, these two components were consistent respectively with low grade osteosarcoma and WDLPS. Cells of the two components were labeled with anti-CDK4 antibody. No labeling with anti-MDM2 antibody and no signal detected with MDM2 FISH analysis were likely due overdecalcification. No frozen tumor tissue was available for FISH analysis nor array-CGH.;Differential diagnoses of this new entity would be a well-differentiated liposarcoma with a low-grade osteosarcomatous component that originates from the soft tissues, ruled out on imaging, and an ossifying parosteal lipoma, ruled out on immunohistochemistry.;This is the first description of a low-grade parosteal sarcoma with two components that morphologically and immunophenotypically demonstrate characteristics of a parosteal osteosarcoma and of a well-differentiated liposarcoma.",

Given the low cell content of this tumor type, we utilized flow cytometry to isolate the diploid normal and aneuploid tumor populations from a well-differentiated liposarcoma prior to array comparative genomic hybridization and whole genome sequencing. This work revealed massive highly focal amplifications throughout the aneuploid tumor genome including MDM2, a gene that has previously been found to be amplified in well-differentiated liposarcoma. Structural analysis revealed massive rearrangement of chromosome 12 and 11 gene fusions, some of which may be part of double minute chromosomes commonly present in well-differentiated liposarcoma. We identified a hotspot of genomic instability localized to a region of chromosome 12 that includes a highly conserved, putative L1 retrotransposon element, LOC100507498 which resides within a gene cluster (NAV3, SYT1, PAWR) where 6 of the 11 fusion events occurred. Interestingly, a potential gene fusion was also identified in amplified DDR2, which is a potential therapeutic target of kinase inhibitors such as dastinib, that are not routinely used in the treatment of patients with liposarcoma. Furthermore, 7 somatic, damaging single nucleotide variants have also been identified, including D125N in the PTPRQ protein. In conclusion, this work is the first to report the entire genome of a well-differentiated liposarcoma with novel chromosomal rearrangements associated with amplification of therapeutically targetable genes such as MDM2 and DDR2.

Alternatively, MDM2 gene amplification or up-regulation represents a mechanism of p53 wild-type inactivation, mainly reported in soft tissue sarcomas. In a previous TP53 analysis carried out on sporadic and NF1-related malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, in two cases, we observed the occurrence of C238Y missense mutation, leading to p53 stabilization unexpectedly coupled with immunophenotypic MDM2 overexpression. To investigate this TP53 missense mutation not yet functionally characterized in mammalian cell, we did MDM2 Southern blot and p53(C238Y)/MDM2 biochemical and functional analyses followed by molecular modeling. The results showed a lack of MDM2 gene amplification, evidence of p53-MDM2 protein complexes, and presence of a p53 that retains the ability to become phosphorylated on Ser15 and to induce the transcription of p21(waf1). Additional molecular modeling data highlighted the structural similarities between p53(C238Y) and wild-type p53, further supporting that the p53(C238Y) mutant still retains functional wild-type p53 properties.",

Because of the lipoblastic differentiation, these tumours caused confusion, and were reported under different names. However, cytogenetic and molecular studies have revealed their DDLPS nature. So far, the cases reported have been high-grade pleomorphic liposarcoma-like tumours. In this study we have collected another series that contains low-grade tumours, and expand the histological spectrum.;Eighteen cases of DDLPS with lipoblastic differentiation from various anatomical locations were analysed by routine histology, immunohistochemistry, and MDM2 fluorescence in-situ hybridization. Two main histological patterns were seen: one featured a spindle cell sarcoma containing lipoblasts with variable nuclear pleomorphism, and the other a pleomorphic liposarcoma-like tumour including the epithelioid variant. Two cases showed low nuclear grade and lipogenic activity in the metastatic foci. CDK4, MDM2 and p16(INK) (4a) overexpression was seen in all except one case.

Mdm2 functions as an oncoprotein, in part, by acting as a negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Multiple spliced forms of Mdm2 transcripts have been observed in human tumors; however, the contribution of these variant transcripts to tumorigenesis is unknown. In this report, we isolate alternative splice forms of Mdm2 transcripts from sarcomas that spontaneously arise in Mdm2-overexpressing mice, including Mdm2-b, the splice form most commonly observed in human cancers. Transduction of Mdm2-b into a variety of cell types reveals that Mdm2-b promotes p53-independent cell growth, inhibits apoptosis, and up-regulates the RelA subunit of NFkappaB. Furthermore, expression of Mdm2-b induces tumor formation in transgenic mice. These results identify a p53-independent role for Mdm2 and determine that an alternate spliced form of Mdm2 can contribute to formation of cancer via a p53-independent mechanism.

Here we investigate whether 'Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer' (FNCLCC) grade and MDM2 gene amplification levels have prognostic value in dedifferentiated liposarcoma in terms of local recurrence and disease-specific survival. Fifty cases were retrieved, reviewed and FNCLCC grade was scored for the dedifferentiated component. Testing for MDM2 gene amplification was performed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Amplification was categorized as high level (≥20 copies) and as low level (<20 copies). Follow-up data was obtained through chart review. Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the effect of grade and level of MDM2 amplification on outcomes. Our series includes 50 patients (male n=28, female n=22) with an average age of 63 years (range, 28-88) and a median follow-up of 28 months (range, 2-120). Tumors were graded as grade 1 (6%), grade 2 (58%), and grade 3 (36%).

Patients with high-level MDM2 amplification had higher recurrence rate on univariate analysis (P=0.028), but not on multivariate analysis (HR=1.69, 95% CI: 0.73, 3.94; P=0.221).

Virol. 81:1912-1922, 2007), and that hdm2 was overexpressed. To further elucidate the relationship between LANA, p53, and hdm2, we purified LANA complexes from PEL by column chromatography.

The half-life of p53 was not extended, which is in contrast to the half-life of simian virus 40 T antigen-transformed cells. p53:p53, LANA:p53, and LANA:LANA complexes coexisted in PEL, and each protein was able to bind to its cognate DNA element. These data suggest that under normal conditions, p53 is inactive in PEL, thus allowing for exponential growth, but that this inactivation is driven by the relative stoichiometries of LANA, hdm2, and p53.

SNP309 occurs at a relatively high frequency in the general population and has been associated with accelerated tumorigenesis in hereditary Li-Fraumeni associated cancers as well as in sporadic soft tissue sarcomas. The objective of this study was to examine the association between SNP309 and sporadic endometrial cancer risk.;Genomic DNA was isolated from 73 patients with endometrial cancer and 79 healthy, female controls. The MDM2 gene promoter region was amplified by PCR and the SNP309 genotype determined by restriction enzyme digestion of the amplified DNA fragment. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between genotypes and endometrial cancer risk and histopathologic features.;The homozygous G/G genotype was found in 25% of endometrial cancer cases and 11% of controls. In an age-adjusted analysis of cases and controls, the G/G genotype increased the risk of endometrial cancer 2.76-fold (95% CI: 1.06, 7.20; p=0.03) compared to presence of a wild-type T allele (T/G and T/T genotypes). No association was found between the SNP309 G/G genotype and either endometrial cancer histology, grade, stage, or age at diagnosis.;The MDM2 SNP309 homozygous G/G genotype may be a genetic variant that influences sporadic endometrial cancer susceptibility.",

The hypothesis tested was if there is a continuum in the development from lipoma to liposarcoma. Lipoma was characterized by a lack of p53 mutation, p53 LOH and p53 protein expression, as well as by mdm2 amplification and mdm2 protein expression. p53 mutation and p53 LOH were found neither in the well-differentiated nor in the dedifferentiated parts of the liposarcoma. In contrast, mdm2 amplification and an increase in mdm2 protein expression were found to be associated with malignancy and dedifferentiation, whereas p53 protein expression was only slightly increased. These findings indicate that mdm2 constitutes one of the most common targets for molecular aberration in WD/DDL.

Four resected lungs, one endarterectomy specimen and three biopsies from eight patients (four males and four females; median age 41 years) suffering from intimal sarcomas of the pulmonary artery using conventional stains, immunohistochemistry, and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) were analyzed. The predominant clinical presentation was dyspnea (all eight patients) and febrile pulmonary disease (six of eight). Signs of embolic lung disease were present in all patients. One patient died postoperatively, six patients died of disease 8-35 months after presentation, and one patient was alive 6 months after surgery. Histopathological examination of the submitted material showed spindle cell, partially myxoid and pleomorphic sarcomas. Metastases were histologically confirmed in three patients (lung, pleura, and skull). Immunohistochemically, vimentin was strongly expressed in all tumors. Focal positivity was observed for alpha smooth muscle actin, CD117, CD68, p53, and bcl2. No reaction could be obtained for endothelial markers. The proliferation index Ki-67 was between 5% and 80%. Six examined tumors were positive for mdm2. In the CGH analysis, gains and amplifications in the 12q13-14 region were found in six of eight tumors (75%). Other, less consistent alterations, were losses on 3p, 3q, 4q, 9p, 11q, 13q, Xp, and Xq, gains on 7p, 17p, and 17q, and amplifications on 4q, 5p, 6p, and 11q. Intimal sarcomas of the pulmonary artery are tumors with an unfavorable prognosis and poorly differentiated morphology. A majority of tumors show a consistent genetic alteration (gains and amplifications in the 12q13-14 region) and overexpression of mdm2, implicating the mdm2/p53 pathway as a possible mechanism in the tumor pathogenesis.",

Transcriptome sequencing techniques have brought forward new diagnostic tools for identifying fusions and/or characterizing unclassified entities. Next-generation sequencing and advanced molecular techniques were also applied to identify potential targets for directed and epigenetic therapy, where preclinical studies reported results for agents active within the receptor tyrosine kinase, mTOR, Notch, Wnt, Hedgehog, Hsp90, and MDM2 signaling networks. At the level of clinical practice, modest developments were seen for some sarcoma subtypes in conventional chemotherapy and in therapies targeting the pathways activated by various receptor tyrosine kinases.

One-third of the tumours developed in patients carrying a germline mutation of RB1 that predisposed them to retinoblastoma and radiation-induced sarcomas. The genetic inactivation of RB1 and/or TP53 genes was frequently observed in these sarcomas. These inactivations were owing to an interplay between point mutations and losses of large chromosome segments. Radiation-induced somatic mutations were observed in TP53, but not in RB1 or in the four other genes, indicating an early role of TP53 in the radio-sarcomagenesis. RB1 and TP53 genes were biallelically coinactivated in all sarcomas developing in the context of the predisposition, indicating that both genes played a major role in the formation of these sarcomas. In the absence of predisposition, TP53 was biallelically inactivated in one-third of the sarcomas, whereas at least one allele of RB1 was wild type. In both genetic contexts, the TP53 pathway was inactivated by genetic lesions and not by the activation of the ARF/MDM2/MDMX pathway, as recently shown in retinoblastomas.

This make-up appears to be confined to half the cases in non-retroperitoneal well-differentiated liposarcomas. Since in different tumours MDM2 amplification involves amplicons encompassing flanking genes, such as CDK4, the possibility was investigated that in these tumours, CDK4 could act as an alternative or additional gene involved in the transformation mechanism. Forty-one retroperitoneal (R)/non-retroperitoneal (NR) well-differentiated-dedifferentiated (WD-DD) and 33 myxoid/round cell liposarcomas were reanalysed by immunocytochemical, molecular (nine cases) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (one case) techniques. The results showed that all but one R WD-E cases carried the mdm2+, p53+, cdk4+ immunophenotype. In NR-WD liposarcomas, this immunophenotype was shared in five cases and the remainder showed mdm2+, p53-, cdk4+ in four and mdm2-, p53-, cdk4+ in one case, showing ring chromosomes by FISH analysis. TP53 mutations are confirmed to be closely correlated with NR-DD liposarcomas and no CDK4 involvement was found in the myxoid/round cell liposarcoma group. As well as confirming the synergistic effect of MDM2 and CDK4, these results are consistent with the concept that amplicon(s) excluding MDM2 may contribute to transformation and support a role of CDK4 in opposing p53 function, particularly in NR WD liposarcoma.",

Unlike other subtypes of osteosarcoma, no data have been published about mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) expression. For this reason, we evaluated the molecular and immunohistochemical features of MDM2 and CDK4 in 27 cases relative to 20 patients with a diagnosis of periosteal osteosarcoma, surgically treated at the Rizzoli Institute between 1981 and 2014. When possible, these results were compared with the MDM2 amplification status as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). All but 1 case (26/27, 96.3%) were negative for MDM2 protein using immunohistochemistry both in primary and in recurrent periosteal osteosarcoma, whereas gene amplification of MDM2 was not detected in any tumor analyzed (10 cases). The positive immunohistochemical case shows a weak/moderate focal nuclear expression of MDM2 antibody in the prevalent cartilaginous component and in the spindle cells of peripheral fibroblastic areas associated with osteoid production in a primary periosteal osteosarcoma. CDK4 immunohistochemical expression was negative in all 27 cases. This retrospective analysis has demonstrated that MDM2 and CDK4 are very rarely expressed in primary and recurrent periosteal osteosarcomas and therefore do not appear to be molecules central to the control of cancer development, growth, and progression in periosteal osteosarcoma. Therefore, when compared with low-grade central and parosteal osteosarcomas, MDM2 and CDK4 markers cannot be used diagnostically to differentiate this subtype of osteosarcoma. ",

However, degradation of RARα through ubiquitin proteasome pathway weakens the differentiation efficiency of osteosarcoma cells. In this study, we discover that murine double minute-2 (MDM2) acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to target RARα for degradation. We observe that MDM2 is required for RARα polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation because downregulation of MDM2 by short hairpin RNA results in the accumulation of RARα, and MDM2 overexpression promotes the degradation of RARα. We also demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of MDM2 (amino acids 1-109) is the major RARα-binding site. Importantly, endogenous MDM2 levels are not only upregulated in human primary osteosarcoma blasts but are also inversely correlated with the level of osteopontin, which is a marker of bone differentiation. Moreover, MDM2 impairs the ATRA-induced osteoblastic differentiation of osteosarcoma cells, whereas an inhibitor of the MDM2 ubiquitin ligase synergizes with ATRA to enhance the differentiation of osteosarcoma cells and primary osteosarcoma blasts. Therefore, our study indicates that MDM2 serves as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to regulate the degradation of RARα and suggests that MDM2 is a novel therapeutic target for ATRA-based differentiation therapeutic approaches in osteosarcoma.

In the retroperitoneal WD-DD liposarcomas, the predominant phenotype is represented by the aberrant (overexpressed) mdm2+/p53+ wild-type profile. At the nonretroperitoneal site, the WD liposarcomas present a wider association of MDM2/P53 gene expression; i.e., mdm2+/p53+, mdm2+/p53-, mdm2-/p53+ and mdm2-/p53-, and TP53 mutations seem to correlate with the dedifferentiation process. A biochemical study of mdm2-p53 association in 11 tumor samples characterized by the presence of different mdm2 and p53 immunophenotypes was performed. Immunoprecipitation assays using a p53-specific antibody were performed on tumor tissue and surrounding normal tissue; the immunoprecipitated material was then investigated for the presence of p53 (control) and of coimmunoprecipitated mdm2. This biochemical analysis showed that, in mdm2+/p53+/wild-type retroperitoneal liposarcomas, a band corresponded to mdm2 protein in the cellular lysates immunoprecipitated with a p53-directed antibody. In contrast, the mdm2+/p53- liposarcoma did not evidence the presence of mdm2 protein nor was p53 protein available to direct immunoprecipitation, as in the p53 mutant tumor samples with mdm2-/p53+ and mdm2-/p53- phenotypes. From the normal counterpart of retroperitoneal liposarcoma lysates, no p53 protein was immunoprecipitated. The findings in this study agree with the molecular data and they show the physical association of mdm2 and p53 in fresh liposarcoma surgical specimens.",

MDM2 expression is up-regulated in numerous cancers, resulting in a loss of p53-dependent activities, such as apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. Genetic amplification and inheritance of MDM2 promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the two best-studied mechanisms for up-regulating MDM2 activity. This article provides an overview of these events in human cancer, highlighting the frequent occurrence of MDM2 amplification in sarcoma and the role of SNP309 and SNP285 in regulating MDM2 expression and cancer risk.

Mutations in the p53 gene were screened by polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. To study loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the tumor-suppressor genes Rb and p53, we used four polymorphic intragenic Rb markers (introns 1, 17, 20, and 25) and two p53 markers (intron 1 and exon 4).;MDM2 amplification was found in 19 of 45 liposarcomas (42.2%).

Of 45 liposarcomas, 6 (13.3%) showed p53 mutations. Overall, alterations of the p53/MDM2/Rb pathway occurred in 30 of 45 liposarcomas (66.6%).

Some of the tumor subtypes are characterized by the presence of distinct chromosomal translocations and fusion genes. When no signs of differentiation are seen, the diagnosis by exclusion becomes undifferentiated spindle cell sarcoma. Cytogenetic, RNA sequencing and RT-PCR analyses were performed on a case of spindle cell sarcoma. The karyotype of the primary tumor was 46,X,del(X)(p?11p?22), der(12)(12pter→12q?22::12q?15→q?22::16p11→16pter),-16,+r(12). MDM2 was found amplified in both the primary tumor and a meta-stasis.

The results indicate that the p53 gene is rarely involved in dedifferentiated liposarcoma (7 per cent of cases analysed) and that low percentages of p53 immunopositivity are still compatible with integrity of the p53 gene. This concept is also supported by the observed preservation of p21Waf1 immunoreactivity in all but the p53-mutated cases.

In this report, we describe the dissection of the MDM2-binding domain on p53 as well as the p53-binding domain on MDM2. We also demonstrate that the oncoprotein simian virus 40 T antigen binds to the product of cellular oncogene mdm2. We have constructed several N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of p53 and MDM2, expressed them in vitro, and assayed their in vitro association capability. The N-terminal boundary of the p53-binding domain on MDM2 is between amino acids 1 and 58, while the C-terminal boundary is between amino acids 221 and 155. T antigen binds to an overlapping domain on the MDM2 protein. On the other hand, the MDM2-binding domain of p53 is defined by amino acids 1 and 159 at the N terminus. At the C terminus, binding is progressively reduced as amino acids 327 to 145 are deleted. We determined the effect of human MDM2 on the transactivation ability of wild-type human p53 in the Saos-2 osteosarcoma cell line, which does not have any endogenous p53. Human MDM2 inhibited the ability of human p53 to transactivate the promoter with p53-binding sites. Thus, human MDM2 protein, like the murine protein, can inactivate the transactivation ability of human p53. Interestingly, both the transactivation domain and the MDM2-binding domain of p53 are situated near the N terminus. We further show that deletion of the N-terminal 58 amino acids of MDM2, which eliminates p53 binding, also abolishes the capability of inactivating p53-mediated transactivation. This finding suggests a correlation of in vitro p53-MDM2 binding with MDM2's ability in vivo to interfere with p53-mediated transactivation.",

A homogeneous cohort of 49 patients with localized SS, restricted to the extremity and with available long-term follow-up information, was selected from our files. We focused our study on molecules involved in the G1 checkpoint and G1-S transition, including cyclins D1 and E, p21(WAF1), p27(Kip1), mdm2, p53, and Ki67. A cutoff point of 10% immunoreactive tumor cell nuclei was selected to define a positive phenotype for any given marker, except for Ki67. High Ki67 proliferative index was considered when >/=20% tumor cells displayed nuclear immunoreactivity. Biphasic SS were analyzed, taking into account separately the expression of these proteins in the spindle and glandular components. Disease specific survival was modeled using the Kaplan-Meier method with log rank test and Cox regression. The cohort of patients analyzed included 23 females and 26 males, and the histological type distribution was 35 monophasic and 14 biphasic SS. The median follow-up for survivors was 53 months, with a 5-year disease-specific survival of 63% and a metastatic disease-free survival of 40%. The positive phenotypes identified for the different markers studied were as follows: cyclin D1, 59%; cyclin E, 29%; p21, 51%; p27, 69%; mdm2, 59%; p53, 16%; and Ki67, 59%. We observed that positive p53, cyclin E, and high Ki67 proliferative index were correlated with survival, but only Ki67 and p53 were independent variables for prognostication.

No further surgical interventions or adjuvant therapies were needed.;EMC is an intermediate-grade neoplasm, characterized by a long clinical course with high potential for local recurrence and distant metastasis. Treatment for EMC is surgical and non-surgical treatment is reserved for recurrence or metastatic disease.

The assessment of MDM2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has become a routine ancillary tool for diagnosing atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT)/well-differentiated liposarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WDL/DDL) in specialist sarcoma units. We describe our experience of its utility at our tertiary institute. Methods. All routine histology samples in which MDM2 amplification was assessed with FISH over a 2-year period were included, and FISH results were correlated with clinical and histologic findings. Results. 365 samples from 347 patients had FISH for MDM2 gene amplification. 170 were positive (i.e., showed MDM2 gene amplification), 192 were negative, and 3 were technically unsatisfactory. There were 122 histologically benign cases showing a histology:FISH concordance rate of 92.6%, 142 WDL/DDL (concordance 96.5%), and 34 cases histologically equivocal for WDL (concordance 50%). Of 64 spindle cell/pleomorphic neoplasms (in which DDL was a differential diagnosis), 21.9% showed MDM2 amplification. Of the cases with discrepant histology and FISH, all but 3 had diagnoses amended following FISH results. For discrepancies of benign histology but positive FISH, lesions were on average larger, more frequently in \"classical\" (intra-abdominal or inguinal) sites for WDL/DDL and more frequently core biopsies. Discrepancies of malignant histology but negative FISH were smaller, less frequently in \"classical\" sites but again more frequently core biopsies. Conclusions. FISH has a high correlation rate with histology for cases with firm histologic diagnoses of lipoma or WDL/DDL. It is a useful ancillary diagnostic tool in histologically equivocal cases, particularly in WDL lacking significant histologic atypia or DDL without corresponding WDL component, especially in larger tumors, those from intra-abdominal or inguinal sites or core biopsies. There is a significant group of well-differentiated adipocytic neoplasms which are difficult to diagnose on morphology alone, in which FISH for MDM2 amplification is diagnostically contributory. ",

MDM2 over-expression has been detected in approximately 80% of liposarcomas but only limited information is available about MDMX over-expression. To date, we are not aware of any study that has described the patterns of MDM2 and MDMX co-expression in liposarcomas. Such information has become more pertinent as various novel MDM2 and/or MDMX single and dual affinity antagonist compounds are emerging as an alternative approach for potential targeted therapeutic strategies.;We analysed a case series of 61 fully characterized liposarcomas of various sub-types by immunohistochemistry, to assess the expression levels of P53, MDM2 and MDMX, simultaneously. P53 sequencing was performed in all cases that expressed P53 protein in 10% or more of cells to rule out mutation-related over-expression.;50 cases over-expressed MDM2 and 42 of these co-expressed MDMX at varying relative levels. The relative expression levels of the two proteins with respect to each other were subtype-dependent. This apparently affected the detected levels of P53 directly in two distinct patterns. Diminished levels of P53 were observed when MDM2 was significantly higher in relation to MDMX, suggesting a dominant role for MDM2 in the degradation of P53. Higher levels of P53 were noted with increasing MDMX levels suggesting an interaction between MDM2 and MDMX that resulted in a reduced efficiency of MDM2 in degrading P53. Of the 26 cases of liposarcoma with elevated P53 expression, 5 were found to have a somatic mutation in the P53 gene.;The results suggest that complex dynamic interactions between MDM2 and MDMX proteins may directly affect the cellular levels of P53. This therefore suggests that careful characterization of both these markers will be necessary in tumours when considering in vivo evaluation of novel blocker compounds for MDM proteins, as a therapeutic strategy to restore wild type P53 function.",

BC-2 cells are latently infected with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV), also known as human herpes virus 8 (HHV8). We examined the effect of MAP30 on the expression of viral and cellular genes in BC-2 during latent and lytic states of the viral life cycle. By Northern analysis and RT-PCR, we found that MAP30 downregulates the expression of viral cyclin D (vCD), viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6), and viral FLIP (vFLIP), genes involved in cell cycle regulation, viral pathogenesis, and apoptosis. By pathway-specific cDNA microarray analysis, we found that BC-2 cells express high levels of egr-1, ATF-2, hsp27, hsp90, IkappaB, mdm2, skp1, and IL-2, cellular genes involved in mitogenesis, tumorigenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis in NFkappaB and p53 signaling pathways. These results define for the first time the specific cellular pathways involved in AIDS-related tumorigenesis and suggest specific novel targets for the treatment. Furthermore, we found that MAP30 downregulates the expression of egr-1, ATF-2, hsp27, hsp90, IkappaB, mdm2, and Skp1, while it upregulates the pro-apoptotic-related genes Bax, CRADD, and caspase-3. Thus, MAP30 modulates the expression of both viral and cellular genes involved in KS pathogenesis.

However, it is debated whether sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma represents a specific rhabdomyosarcoma entity or a variant of embryonal or alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. To date, 6 sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma karyotypes and 1 sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma comparative genomic hybridization profile have been reported. We present the first whole-genome tumoral genotyping of a sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma by high-density single nucleotide polymorphism array. The single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping revealed a complex pattern including gains and losses of whole chromosomes and an amplification of the 12q13-15 region. Amplification of the 12q13-q15 region containing SAS, GLI, CDK4, and MDM2 has been observed in rhabdomyosarcoma. In the present case, the 2 amplified target genes were MDM2 and HMGA2, excluding CDK4. The identification of a specific MDM2-HGMA2 amplicon excluding CDK4 has only been described so far in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Further studies are needed to assess if this anomaly is a specific marker of sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma.",

Low-grade osteosarcoma is often confused with benign lesions, and ancillary techniques to enhance diagnostic accuracy have been awaited. This study explores the use of MDM2 and CDK4 immunohistochemistry for the histological diagnosis of low-grade osteosarcoma. We studied 23 cases of low-grade osteosarcoma from 21 patients (parosteal osteosarcoma (n=14), low-grade central osteosarcoma (n=9)) and 40 cases of benign histological mimics (myositis ossificans (n=11), fibrous dysplasia (n=14), osteochondroma (n=6), desmoplastic fibroma (n=1), florid reactive periostitis (n=4), Nora's lesion (n=3), and turret exostosis (n=1)). Low-grade osteosarcoma labeled for MDM2 in 16 cases (70%) and for CDK4 in 20 cases (87%). All low-grade osteosarcomas expressed one or both markers (100%), with 13 cases (57%) expressing both. Staining pattern was diffuse in most cases, and the majority expressed moderate or strong intensity for either antibody. MDM2/CDK4 immunostaining was shown irrespective of low-grade osteosarcoma histological subtype. In contrast, only 1 Nora's lesion out of the 40 miscellaneous benign processes showed immunoreactivity for MDM2 or CDK4. The combination of these two markers thus shows 100% sensitivity and 97.5% specificity for the diagnosis of low-grade osteosarcoma. MDM2 and CDK4 immunostains therefore reliably distinguish low-grade osteosarcoma from benign histological mimics, and their combination may serve as a useful adjunct in this difficult differential diagnosis.",

Therefore, we postulated that p53 may also be involved in Kaposi's sarcoma associated with AIDS (AIDS-KS). Expression of the p53 gene was examined in freshly isolated tumor biopsy specimens from 15 patients with AIDS-KS. p53 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in both the AIDS-KS tumors and in normal skin control samples. p53 protein was detected in 4 of the 15 AIDS-KS specimens by immunohistochemical staining. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis PCR-products (PCR-SSCP) was used for detection of mutations of the p53 gene. One of the p53 positive AIDS-KS samples showed mobilized shifts in exon 6 suggestive of a mutation. Sequencing data showed the mutation to be located in codon 210. We examined other mechanisms that could stabilize p53 protein. SV40 large T antigen and adenovirus E1B protein were not found in the AIDS-KS specimens. MDM2, a p53-binding protein, was also detected in five of the AIDS-KS specimens, two of which also contained p53-positive cells.

Following DNA damage or cellular stress, p53 is phosphorylated within the Mdm2 binding domain on threonine 18 and serine 20. To analyze the roles of these phosphorylation events, residues 18 and 20 were mutated to alanines. Transient transfection into p53-null cells demonstrated that the T18A protein can be expressed stably, but the S20A protein is very unstable, precluding further analysis. When expressed stably at low basal levels in p53-null human fibroblasts or fibrosarcoma cells, the T18A mutant accumulated 5-10-fold less well than wild-type p53 following exposure to UV. Analysis of p53-dependent transcription following UV revealed that the phosphorylation of threonine 18 is required for transactivation of the p21, Hdm2 (the human ortholog of Mdm2), and GADD45 genes. The phosphorylation of serine 33, another early event following DNA damage, is not required for p53 accumulation or p53-dependent transactivation following UV.",

DDLPS is a nonlipogenic sarcoma characterized by amplification of MDM2 and CDK4. PLPS is a high-grade sarcoma containing lipoblasts, characterized by a complex karyotype and a more aggressive clinical course. Rarely, DDLPS shows lipogenic differentiation, mimicking PLPS. The cytomorphologic features of DDLPS and PLPS and the utility of ancillary studies have not been systemically analyzed.;Cytologic preparations of 25 DDLPS and 13 PLPS, all histologically confirmed, were retrospectively reviewed along with clinical and cytogenetic data. Sample cellularity, vascular architecture, background material, predominant cell morphology, quality of the cytoplasm, and nuclear pleomorphism were compared for both tumor types. Immunohistochemistry for MDM2 and CDK4 was performed on cell blocks and/or core needle biopsies.;Fine-needle aspirate smears from both DDLPS and PLPS were variably cellular, composed of cellular clusters and noncohesive cells. Abundant myxoid stroma was present in ∼25% of DDLPS and PLPS cases, whereas branching curvilinear vessels were more common in DDLPS than in PLPS (7 of 25 versus 2 of 13). Tumors were composed of predominantly spindled (18 of 25 DDLPS versus 3 of 13 PLPS) or epithelioid cells (7 of 25 DDLPS versus 6 of 13 PLPS). Pleomorphic cells were predominant in 3 PLPS, and were frequent in both (13 of 25 DDLPS versus 10 of 13 PLPS). The cytoplasm was mostly fibrillary and often vacuolated in both entities. Other features included necrosis, mitoses, and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate. The main cytologic differences were the presence of marked pleomorphism, abundant lipoblasts, and cells with microvacuolated cytoplasm in most PLPS. A total of 24 (96%) and 20 (80%) cases of DDLPS expressed MDM2 and CDK4, respectively, whereas none of the PLPS expressed both markers. Six DDLPS tested showed ring or giant marker chromosomes and/or MDM2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization; 2 PLPS had complex karyotypes.;DDLPS and PLPS exhibit variable and occasionally overlapping cytologic features. The presence of lipoblasts, cells with microvacuolated cytoplasm, and marked pleomorphism are more suggestive of PLPS, but these characteristics can be present in DDLPS.

The expression of this oncoprotein is being studied by researchers world-wide, and the amount of data published about it is increasing exponentially. Although there are some conflicting data about the effects of MDM2 expression in individual cancers, the overall evidence is convincing, indicating that increased MDM2 expression is related to a worse clinical prognosis. There is an increased likelihood of distant metastases, as well as a decreased response to therapeutic intervention in MDM2-positive cancers. MDM2 may also serve as a diagnostic marker, not only for cancer stage, but to differentiate between similar cancers. MDM2 may also be associated with drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy.

FRS2 is located on chromosome 12q13-15 that is frequently amplified in liposarcomas. The significance of FRS2 and FGFR signaling in high-grade liposarcomas is unknown. Herein, we first comparatively examined the amplification and expression of FRS2 with CDK4 and MDM2 in dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLS) and undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma (UHGPS). Amplification and expression of the three genes were identified in 90% to 100% (9-11 of 11) of DDLS, whereas that of FRS2, CDK4, and MDM2 were observed in 55% (41 of 75), 48% (36 of 75), and 44% (33/75) of clinically diagnosed UHGPS, suggesting that these \"UHGPS\" may represent DDLS despite lacking histologic evidence of lipoblasts. Immunohistochemical analysis of phosphorylated FRS2 protein indicated that the FGFR/FRS2 signaling axis was generally activated in about 75% of FRS2-positive high-grade liposarcomas. Moreover, we found that FRS2 and FGFRs proteins are highly expressed and functional in three high-grade liposarcoma cell lines: FU-DDLS-1, LiSa-2, and SW872. Importantly, the FGFR selective inhibitor NVP-BGJ-398 significantly inhibited the growth of FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cells with a concomitant suppression of FGFR signal transduction. Attenuation of FRS2 protein in FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cell lines decreased the phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and AKT and repressed cell proliferation. These findings indicate that analysis of FRS2 in combination with CDK4 and MDM2 will more accurately characterize pathologic features of high-grade liposarcomas. Activated FGFR/FRS2 signaling may play a functional role in the development of high-grade liposarcomas, therefore, serve as a potential therapeutic target.",

Furthermore, three distinct DNA tumour virus groups--papovaviruses, adenoviruses and human papillomaviruses--transform cells by targeting and inactivating certain functions of both the p53 and retinoblastoma proteins. The cellular oncoprotein, Mdm2, binds to and downmodulates p53 function; its human homologue, MDM2, is amplified in certain human tumours, including sarcomas and gliomas. Overproduction of Mdm2 is both tumorigenic and capable of immortalizing primary rat embryo fibroblasts.

The transcriptional activation function of p53 is inactivated by interaction with the mdm2 gene product. Amplification of mdm2 has been observed in 36% of human sarcomas, indicating that it may represent an alternative mechanism of preventing p53 function in tumour development. To study mdm2 function in vivo, we generated an mdm2 null allele by homologous recombination. Mdm2 null mice are not viable, and further analysis revealed embryonic lethality around implantation. To examine the importance of the interaction of MDM2 with p53 in vivo, we crossed mice heterozygous for mdm2 and p53 and obtained progeny homozygous for both p53 and mdm2 null alleles. Rescue of the mdm2-/- lethality in a p53 null background suggests that a critical in vivo function of MDM2 is the negative regulation of p53 activity.",

Overexpression of Mdm2 can immortalize primary cultures of rodent fibroblasts. Human MDM2 is amplified in 30-40% of sarcomas, and is overexpressed in leukaemic cells. The Mdm2 oncoprotein forms a complex with the p53 tumour-suppressor protein and inhibits p53-mediated transregulation of gene expression. Because Mdm2 expression increases in response to p53, Mdm2-p53 binding may autoregulate Mdm2 expression and modulate the activity of p53 in the cell. We have created Mdm2-null and Mdm2/p53-null mice to determine whether Mdm2 possesses developmental functions in addition to the ability to complex with p53, and to investigate the biological role of Mdm2-p53 complex formation in development. Mice deficient for Mdm2 die early in development. In contrast, mice deficient for both Mdm2 and p53 develop normally and are viable.

Rhabdomyosarcomas resemble developing skeletal muscle, notably in their expression of the MRF family of transcription factors and the PAX3 and PAX7 genes. These PAX genes are also involved through specific translocations, t(2;13)(q35;q14) and variant t(1;13)(p36;q14) in the alveolar subtype, which result in PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR fusion genes, respectively. The fusion genes are thought critically to affect downstream targets of PAX3 and PAX7 or possibly have novel targets. Similar downstream changes may also be involved in embryonal and fusion gene negative cases. Genomic amplification of such genes as MYCN, MDM2, CDK4, and PAX7-FKHR is a feature mainly of the alveolar subtype, while specific chromosomal gains, including chromosomes 2, 8, 12, and 13, are associated with the embryonal subtype. Loss of alleles and imprinting at 11p15.5 and disruption of genes such as IGF2, ATR, PTC, P16, and TP53 have also been implicated in rhabdomyosarcoma development. Whereas there is now a realistic possibility of cure in the majority of cases, there remains a subset that is resistant to multimodality therapy, including high-dose chemotherapy. Characterization of the defining molecular features of tumors that are likely to behave aggressively represents a particular challenge. Current research is leading toward a better understanding of rhabdomyosarcoma tumorigenesis, which may ultimately result in novel therapeutic strategies that increase the overall cure.

However, MDM2 has many other binding partners and its p53-independent role in the regulation of cell growth and survival appears to be extremely complex. This report describes the expression of MDM2 in two rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, both expressing a mutant p53 gene. Expression of MDM2 in Rh30 cells enhanced cell growth whereas expression of MDM2 in RD cells suppressed their growth and enhanced the rate of spontaneous apoptosis. The mechanism for these opposite phenotypes was demonstrated to be due to differential effects on the NFkappaB pathway. Previously MDM2 has been shown to activate NFkappaB through activation of transcription of the p65RelA subunit. In Rh30 cells MDM2 acted similarly to previously described, thereby promoting growth of Rh30 cells. In untreated RD cells p65RelA was constitutively overexpressed resulting in activation of the NFkappaB pathway. Expression of MDM2 in RD cells transcriptionally repressed p65RelA and suppressed NFkappaB activity, resulting in a reduced growth rate and enhanced apoptosis. The MDM2-sensitive region of the p65 promoter was localized to a 225 bp fragment to which MDM2 protein was shown to bind. The observation that MDM2 induces apoptosis under certain circumstances may help to explain the apparently surprising clinical studies that have shown that MDM2 expression in tumors is often associated with a favorable prognosis.",

They may occasionally dedifferentiate into high-grade tumors, typically in the form of high-grade osteosarcoma, which are histologically indistinguishable from conventional osteosarcomas. MDM2 and CDK4 are often amplified in low-grade osteosarcomas and their dedifferentiated counterparts, and the encoded proteins are accordingly overexpressed. As MDM2/CDK4 expression was reportedly rare in conventional osteosarcoma, we hypothesized that these markers may help separate dedifferentiated osteosarcoma from the conventional type. To test this, we performed MDM2 and CDK4 immunohistochemistry on 81 primary and 26 recurrent/metastatic high-grade osteosarcomas and correlated these data with the histology of the primary resection material, with particular attention to the potential presence of any coexisting low-grade osteosarcomatous components. MDM2 and CDK4 coexpression was identified in 7 cases, and on careful histologic review 6 of them were discovered to contain foci of coexisting low-grade elements. One case was a known dedifferentiated parosteal osteosarcoma, and the remaining 5 cases were newly identified dedifferentiated osteosarcomas in which the limited low-grade components were originally unrecognized. An additional 11 cases expressed either marker alone, whereas the remaining 89 cases were negative for both markers; no resection material from these 100 cases presented with a low-grade component. MDM2/CDK4 gene amplification status, determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in selected cases, was largely concordant with immunoexpression. Our data suggest that MDM2 and CDK4 coexpression in high-grade osteosarcomas is sensitive and specific to those that progressed from low-grade osteosarcomas, and immunohistochemistry may help identify this dedifferentiated subgroup to facilitate accurate subclassification.",

The Mdm2 gene is a known oncogene that is amplified in approximately one-third of sarcomas and whose protein product interacts with the tumor suppressor p53. Concimitant with such gene amplification events is the activation and mobilization of endogenous retroelements, typically through the relaxation of epigenetic controlling mechanisms. Processed pseudogenes, which can be formed through endogenous LINE retroelement activity, may indicate increased genomic instability. We have isolated processed pseudogenes for Mdm2 in Mus caroli DNA, likely formed from independent events in different individuals. This is the first identification and characterization of an Mdm2 pseudogene in any organism. Multiple retrotransposition events are suggested by the variable sequence and genomic structure of the identified pseudogenes across all exons and the 3'UTR. The high degree of similarity between the gene and each pseudogene, as well as the lack of evidence for an Mdm2 pseudogene in several other species of Mus, indicate evolutionarily recent retrotransposition events leading to the formation of the Mdm2 pseudogenes in M. caroli. Previous studies on the Mdm2 locus in Mus caroli showed amplification and overexpression of this gene on double minute chromosomes in a Mus musculus x Mus caroli interspecific hybrid.

However, the presence of oncogenic splice variants of mdm2 in human tumors that lack the p53 binding site has suggested a p53-independent transforming function for this protein. This report describes expression of 11 different mdm2 splice variants in pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cell lines and tumors at a frequency of 75% and 82%, respectively. Five of these isoforms have previously been described in other tumor histiotypes but six are novel and may be unique to RMS. There was no association between expression of splice variants and mdm2 gene amplification or p53 status. In addition, the frequency of splice variants was much higher than the incidence of mdm2 amplification or p53 mutations. These variants may be important to consider with respect to RMS tumor progression and therapeutic response.",

The p53-MDM2 interaction pathway has been suggested as a novel target for cancer therapy. To that end, several strategies have been explored, including the use of small polypeptides targeted to the MDM2-p53 binding domain, anti-MDM2 antisense oligonucleotides, and natural agents. Different generations of anti-human-MDM2 oligonucleotides have been tested in in vitro and in vivo human cancer models, revealing specific inhibition of MDM2 expression and significant antitumor activity. Use of antisense oligos potentiated the effects of growth inhibition, p53 activation and p21 induction by several chemotherapeutic agents. Increased therapeutic effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs in human cancer cell lines carrying p53 mutations or deletions have shown the ability of MDM2 inhibitors to act as chemosensitizers in various types of tumors through both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. Inhibiting MDM2 appears to also have a role in radiation therapy for human cancer, regardless of p53 status, providing a rationale for the development of a new class of radiosensitizers. Moreover, MDM2 antisense oligonucleotides potentiate the effect of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors by affecting in vitro and in vivo proliferation, apoptosis and protein expression in hormone-refractory and hormone-dependent human prostate cancer cells. These data support the development, among other MDM2 inhibitors, of anti-MDM2 antisense oligonucleotides as a novel class of anticancer agents, and suggest a potentially relevant role for the oligonucleotides when integrated with conventional treatments and/or other signaling inhibitors in novel therapeutic strategies.",

Two polymorphisms located in the MDM2 promoter P2 have been shown to affect cancer risk. One of these polymorphisms (SNP309T>G; rs2279744) facilitates Sp1 transcription factor binding to the promoter and is associated with increased cancer risk. In contrast, SNP285G>C (rs117039649), located 24 bp upstream of rs2279744, and in complete linkage disequilibrium with the SNP309G allele, reduces Sp1 recruitment and lowers cancer risk. Thus, fine tuning of MDM2 expression has proven to be of significant importance with respect to tumorigenesis. We assessed the potential functional effects of a third MDM2 promoter P2 polymorphism (SNP344T>A; rs1196333) located on the SNP309T allele. While in silico analyses indicated SNP344A to modulate TFAP2A, SPIB and AP1 transcription factor binding, we found no effect of SNP344 status on MDM2 expression levels.

        "Doc_abstract":"The MDM2 oncogene is amplified or overexpressed in human cancers. It has also been suggested that MDM2 levels are associated with poor prognosis of several human cancers. The MDM2 oncoprotein binds to the p53 tumor suppressor protein and serves as a negative regulator of p53. The p53 tumor suppressor also has an important role in cancer therapy, with p53-mediated apoptosis being a major mechanism of action for many clinically used cancer chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy. Therefore, the negative regulation of p53 by MDM2 may limit the magnitude of p53 activation by DNA damaging agents, thereby limiting their therapeutic effectiveness. The investigators hypothesize that, by inhibiting MDM2 expression, the MDM2 oncoprotein level will be reduced and the MDM2 negative feedback inhibition of p53 will be diminished, resulting in a significant increase of functional p53 levels that will modulate p53-mediated therapeutic effects. The overall objective of the present study was to investigate the functions of MDM2 oncogene in tumor growth and the potential value of MDM2 as a drug target for cancer therapy. The role of MDM2 in tumor growth is determined by inhibiting MDM2 expression in in vivo models of human cancers. The in vivo synergistically therapeutic effects of MDM2 inhibition and DNA damaging agents were also evaluated. Significant in vitro antitumor activities were found in cell lines, human osteosarcoma SJSA and choriocarcinoma JAR, in a time-, concentration-, and sequence-dependent manner. Following i.p. administration of anti-MDM2 antisense oligonucleotides, in vivo antitumor activity was observed in nude mice bearing SJSA and JAR xenografts in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, in vivo synergistically therapeutic effects of MDM2 inhibition and DNA damaging agents adriamycin and 10-hydroxycamptothecin were observed. This study should provide the basis for future development of anti-MDM2 antisense oligonucleotides as cancer therapeutic agents used alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics.",

Here, we examined the expression of these genes in clinical samples of CTCLs. We detected the transcripts of FRA2, JUND, CCR4, MYB, MDM2, and BCL6 at high levels in CTCL skin lesions. Except for BCL6, we confirmed protein expression of FRA2, JUND, CCR4, MYB, and MDM2 in CTCL skin lesions. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated knockdown of FRA2 or JUND suppressed cell growth and the expression of CCR4, MYB, MDM2, and BCL6 in CTCL cell lines.

In contrast with the rare involvement of the TP53 gene in well differentiated liposarcoma, aberrations of the TP53 gene were observed in approximately 30% of cases of myxoid and round cell liposarcoma.

However, not all tumors respond favorably to these drugs. CDK4 activity is critical for progression through G1 phase and into the mitotic cell cycle. Inhibiting this kinase induces Rb-positive cells to exit the cell cycle into either a quiescent or senescent state. In this report, using well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WD/DDLS) cell lines, we show that the proteolytic turnover of MDM2 is required for CDK4i-induced senescence. Failure to reduce MDM2 does not prevent CDK4i-induced withdrawal from the cell cycle but the cells remain in a reversible quiescent state. Reducing MDM2 in these cells drives them into the more stable senescent state. CDK4i-induced senescence associated with loss of MDM2 is also observed in some breast cancer, lung cancer and glioma cell lines indicating that this is not limited to WD/DDLS cells in which MDM2 is overexpressed or in cells that contain wild type p53. MDM2 turnover depends on its E3 ligase activity and expression of ATRX. Interestingly, in seven patients the changes in MDM2 expression were correlated with outcome. These insights identify MDM2 and ATRX as new regulators controlling geroconversion, the process by which quiescent cells become senescent, and this insight may be exploited to improve the activity of CDK4i in cancer therapy.",

MDM2 has been shown to be overexpressed in sarcomas and more recently was implicated in the pathogenesis of carcinomas. The purpose of this study was to determine the expression pattern of MDM2 in adenomas and colorectal adenocarcinomas and decide whether there is a correlation between MDM2 and p53 protein status. Paraffin-embedded tissues from 52 colorectal cancer (CRC) specimens and their adjacent normal tissue (N-CRC) were studied. In addition, 56 sporadic adenomas were investigated for the immunohistochemical expression of MDM2 and p53 proteins. Immunoreactivity of p53 indicating p53 gene mutation (p53+) was significantly higher in CRC (44%) compared to adenomas (23.2%) (P <0.01). None of the N-CRC specimens expressed the immunoreactive p53 protein. MDM2 overexpression (MDM2+) was similar in adenomas (30.3%) and CRC (25%), but only 2 (3.8%) of 52 N-CRC specimens showed overexpression of MDM2. In most cases MDM2 expression was associated with negative p53 expression (wild-type p53) in both adenomas (r = 0.59, P <0.001) and CRC (r = 0.69, P <0. 0001). No correlation was found between MDM2, p53 expression, and either the histologic grade, nodal stage or morphology of the tumors. There is greater p53 mutation in CRC compared to adenomas and N-CRC. The data indicate that MDM2 is overexpressed in CRC and is significantly associated with wild-type p53 compared to N-CRC specimens from the same patient. The MDM2 expression pattern is similar in adenomas and CRC, which may suggest that MDM2 overexpression is an early event in the progression of CRC.",

Due to absence of clinically effective treatment options in inoperable situations and resistance to chemotherapeutics, a critical need exists to identify novel therapeutic targets. We analyzed LPS genomic landscape using SNP arrays, whole exome sequencing and targeted exome sequencing to uncover the genomic information for development of specific anti-cancer targets. SNP array analysis indicated known amplified genes (MDM2, CDK4, HMGA2) and important novel genes (UAP1, MIR557, LAMA4, CPM, IGF2, ERBB3, IGF1R). Carboxypeptidase M (CPM), recurrently amplified gene in well-differentiated/de-differentiated LPS was noted as a putative oncogene involved in the EGFR pathway. Notable deletions were found at chromosome 1p (RUNX3, ARID1A), chromosome 11q (ATM, CHEK1) and chromosome 13q14.2 (MIR15A, MIR16-1). Significantly and recurrently mutated genes (false discovery rate < 0.05) included PLEC (27%), MXRA5 (21%), FAT3 (24%), NF1 (20%), MDC1 (10%), TP53 (7%) and CHEK2 (6%). Further, in vitro and in vivo functional studies provided evidence for the tumor suppressor role for Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene in different subtypes of LPS. Pathway analysis of recurrent mutations demonstrated signaling through MAPK, JAK-STAT, Wnt, ErbB, axon guidance, apoptosis, DNA damage repair and cell cycle pathways were involved in liposarcomagenesis. Interestingly, we also found mutational and copy number heterogeneity within a primary LPS tumor signifying the importance of multi-region sequencing for cancer-genome guided therapy. In summary, these findings provide insight into the genomic complexity of LPS and highlight potential druggable pathways for targeted therapeutic approach. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The p53 tumour suppressor gene is a cell cycle regulator, able to induce cell cycle arrest to allow DNA repair or apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms underlying p53 action imply transactivation of p53 dependent genes such as WAF1 (for wild type p53 associated fragment 1) and the murine double minute (MDM2) gene. In some cases, inactivation of the p53 gene results from p53 gene mutations leading to p53 protein accumulation, but in others it may results from mechanisms other than mutation, such as interaction with viral or cellular proteins. The expression of p53 protein and p53 transactivated gene proteins p21/WAF1 and MDM2, combined with in situ detection of apoptosis, was studied in specimens of CMV-infected patients as an in vivo model of p53 alteration not due to point mutation. p53 positivity was found in CMV + cells in different tissues, in cells with typical inclusion bodies, and in in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry CMV + cells without inclusions (hidden infection). Although this p53 reactivity was accompanied by the expression of MDM2 and p21/WAF1 proteins, the patterns of MDM2 and p21/WAF1 protein expression were mutually exclusive, and were associated with the presence or absence of inclusion bodies. Nuclei bearing inclusion bodies were usually MDM2+, p21/ WAF1-, while hidden infected cells were usually MDM2-, p21/WAF1+. Apoptosis was not detected in any tissue section from CMV-infected patients. Two alternative patterns were found in CMV-infected tissues: p53+, p21/WAF1+, MDM2-, or p53+, p21/WAF1-. MDM2+ protein expression. These may represent examples of p53 dependent alternative effects in the course of CMV infection. Early stages are represented by CMV + cells without inclusion bodies, which display p53 and p21/ WAF1 expression, suggesting that p53 could be acting as a growth suppressor protein. Late CMV infection is represented by cells harbouring inclusion bodies. These cells showed a p53+, p21/WAF1-, MDM2+ profile, consistent with MDM2 mediated p53 inactivation. The absence of p21/WAF1 expression and lack of apoptosis suggest that the p53 protein expressed by MDM2+ cells could be functionally inactivated in CMV-infected cells with inclusion bodies. Previous studies have suggested that p53 inactivation by MDM2 over-expression occurs in sarcomas and lymphomas. Our observations seem to indicate that this mechanism of MDM2 mediated p53 inactivation may play a role in the late phase of CMV infection.",

Recently, we found that MDM2 interacts with Sp1 and inhibits Sp1-dependent transcription and that pRb can restore Sp1 activity by displacing MDM2 from Sp1 (2). In this report, we show that forced expression of Sp1 can restore MyoD activity and restore overt muscle cell differentiation in cells with amplified MDM2. Furthermore, we show that pRb can also restore MyoD activity and muscle cell differentiation in cells with amplified MDM2. Surprisingly, we found that the MyoD-interacting domain of pRb is dispensable for this activity. We show that the C-terminal, MDM2-interacting domain of pRb is both necessary and sufficient to restore muscle cell differentiation in cells with amplified MDM2. We also show that the C-terminal MDM2-interacting domain of pRb can promote premature differentiation of proliferating myoblast cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"Mutations in the p53 tumour suppressor gene are the most common genetic alteration found in human cancers. Most of them are accompanied by stabilization of the protein, which renders it detectable through immunohistochemical techniques. Although p53 expression is a very common finding in Hodgkin's disease (HD), the status of the p53 gene is scarcely known, due to the difficulty in sequencing this gene in a lesion in which tumour cells are thought to constitute a very minor subpopulation, diluted in a background of supposedly benign cells. The pattern of expression of two downstream p53 proteins (MDM2 and p21 WAF1/CIP1, was studied as an indirect way of assessing p53 gene status. MDM2 is a wild-p53 inducible protein which may form a complex with p53, abrogating its function, as has been found in human sarcomas and other malignancies. p21WAF1/CIP1 is another protein inducible by wild-type p53, involved in inhibiting cell-cycle progression, through binding to cyclin/cyclin-dependent-kinase complexes. MDM2 and p21WAF1/CIP1 immunostaining was detected in all the cases analysed, independently of histological type, and were mainly present in Sternberg-Reed and Hodgkin (H & SR) cells. These immunohistochemical results were confirmed by Western blotting. To study the cause of MDM2 protein accumulation, MDM2 mRNA expression was also investigated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results show the presence of MDM2 transcripts in all cases of HD, albeit at lower levels than those found in reactive lymphoid tissue. These results seem to support the hypothesis that p53 is transcriptionally active in at least some of the H & SR cells in HD, and is able to induce MDM2 and p21WAF1/CIP1 protein expression.",

We investigated a series of 38 WDLPS/DDLPS using fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with 17 probes encompassing the 12q13-15 region. In addition, using quantitative RT-PCR we studied the expression of MDM2, CDK4, DDIT3 (CHOP/GADD153), DYRK2, HMGA2, TSPAN31 and YEATS4 (GAS41) in 11 cases. We showed that CDK4 (12q14.1) belonged to a distinct amplicon than MDM2 (12q15). There was no continuity in the amplified sequences between MDM2 and CDK4. Moreover, while MDM2 was amplified and overexpressed in all cases, CDK4 was not amplified or overexpressed in 13% of cases. The centromeric border of the CDK4 amplicon was located immediately downstream the 5' end of DDIT3, a gene known for being involved in myxoid liposarcoma translocations. DDIT3 was amplified in 3 cases and overexpressed in 9 cases. The overexpression of DDIT3 was correlated to the CDK4 amplification and not to its own amplification status. This suggested that the CDK4 amplicon, as well as the overexpression of DDIT3, might be generated by the disruption of a fragile region in 5' DDIT3. HMGA2 was always amplified and rearranged indicating that it plays a central role in WDLPS/DDLPS. HMGA2 rearrangement frequently resulted in a loss of the 3' end region that is a binding site for let-7.

In general, the staining pattern was restricted not to the nuclei, but to selected subnuclear compartments, probably representing the golgi apparatus or the endoplasmatic reticulum.

This convergent evolution reflects the common need of these viruses to inactivate these two important regulators of cell cycle progression and cell survival. Polyomavirus, a close relative of SV40, is different. Its large T protein complexes only with RB, not with p53. We have examined whether this is compensated by the frequent appearance of p53 mutations in polyomavirus-induced tumours. We tested the p53 status of 15 polyomavirus-induced sarcomas. Two sarcomas were p53-negative while six carried mutant p53. Another six sarcomas expressed low levels of wild-type p53. One tumour expressed high levels of wild-type p53 protein as shown by DNA sequencing and immunofluorescence staining. MDM2 amplification was not detected in any of the tumours, but Northern blotting showed that MDM2 was overexpressed in at least two tumours that expressed wild-type p53 and in one tumour that expressed both wild-type and mutant p53. Treatment with the DNA-damaging agent mitomycin C caused p53 protein accumulation followed by induction of MDM2 and WAF1/p21 mRNA in four of the tumours expressing wild-type p53, indicating that p53-mediated transcriptional activation was unaltered in these tumours. However, p53-mediated transactivation of WAF1/p21 was impaired in the wild-type p53-expressing tumours that expressed elevated levels of MDM2.

        "Doc_abstract":"Karyotypic complexities associated with frequent loss or rearrangement of a number of chromosome arms, deletions, and mutations affecting the TP53 region, and molecular alterations of the INK4A gene have been reported in sporadic and/or neurofibromatosis type I (NF1)-related malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). However, no investigations addressing possible different pathogenetic pathways in sporadic and NF1-associated MPNSTs have been reported. This lack is unexpected because, despite similar morphologic and immunophenotypic features, NF1-related cases are, by definition, associated with NF1 gene defects. Thus, we investigated the occurrence of TP53 and p16(INK4A) gene deregulation and the presence of microsatellite alterations at markers located at 17p, 17q, 9p21, 22q, 11q, 1p, or 2q loci in MPNSTs and neurofibromas either related (14 cases) or unrelated (14 cases) to NF1. Our results indicate that, in MPNSTs, p16(INK4A) inactivation almost equally affects both groups. However, TP53 mutations and loss of heterozygosity involving the TP53 locus (43% versus 9%), and p53 wild type overexpression, related or not to mdm2 overexpression (71% versus 25%), seem to mainly be restricted to sporadic MPNSTs. In NF1-associated MPNSTs, our microsatellite results are consistent with the occurrence of somatic inactivation by loss of heterozygosity of the second NF1 allele.",

The aim of this study was to analyse the clinicopathological and genetic features of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated LPS with prominent myxoid stroma.;  Fifty-six cases of LPS (22 well-differentiated; 34 dedifferentiated) with prominent myxoid stroma were evaluated. Most arose in the retroperitoneum, abdominal cavity, or spermatic cord. The mean size was 170 mm. Myxoid LPS-like plexiform vessels were conspicuous in 11 cases of well-differentiated LPS. In 22 cases of dedifferentiated LPS, myxofibrosarcoma-like curvilinear vessels were prominent. In other cases, the myxoid component had variably bland or pleomorphic morphology. By immunohistochemistry, staining for MDM2 was positive in 95% of cases, and CDK4 in 78%. Cytogenetics in 13 cases showed ring and giant marker chromosomes. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization showed amplification of 12q13-15 in six cases evaluated. Of 30 patients with follow-up, all but one had local recurrences (up to four), but only one has so far had distant metastases.;  Well-differentiated/dedifferentiated LPS with prominent myxoid stroma can closely resemble other sarcoma types, especially myxoid LPS and myxofibrosarcoma. The clinical presentation (large retroperitoneal or abdominal tumour) is a clue to the correct diagnosis; the degree of nuclear atypia helps to exclude myxoid LPS. Immunohistochemistry for MDM2 and CDK4 and genetic analysis can be useful to confirm the diagnosis.",

Recently, an amplicon originating from 1q21-23, containing the candidate oncogenes COAS1, COAS2 and COAS3 (Chromosome One Amplified Sequence) was identified. The presence, distribution and copy number level of extra COAS sequences were investigated in 48 bone and soft tissue tumor (BSTT) samples using metaphase FISH analysis. Amplification was seen in 27/48 (56%) samples. With few exceptions, all 3 genes were involved, but on average COAS2 exhibited higher copy numbers. The presence of extra COAS signals, irrespective of copy numbers, was found at similar frequencies in different histologic tumor subtypes. However, medium or high level amplification was common in lipomatous tumors but rare in other, nonlipomatous tumors (9/21 vs. 2/27 samples). The most common localization of extra COAS signals in lipomatous tumors was in supernumerary ring and giant marker chromosomes. Among nonlipomatous tumors, the distribution of extra COAS genes was more disperse, being located in various unidentified chromosomal structures, including double minutes, and only rarely in ring chromosomes. Because MDM2 is known to be amplified frequently in BSTTs, and in particular in atypical lipomatous tumors, cases with extra copies of COAS were studied also with an MDM2 probe. Twelve out of 18 lipomatous tumors had extra copies of both COAS and MDM2, and the 2 genes were found to be coamplified and interspersed exclusively in ring and giant marker chromosomes. Also 12 out of 18 nonlipomatous tumors exhibited simultaneous gain of COAS and MDM2, but colocalization in the same chromosome was less frequent. The role of the frequent coamplification of COAS, or some other yet unknown gene in the 1q21-23 region, and MDM2 remains to be elucidated.",

This analysis reveals a bilateral belt-type interaction that results in inhibition of HAUSP. The vif1 peptide binds the HAUSP TRAF domain, competitively blocking substrate binding, whereas the vif2 peptide binds both the HAUSP TRAF and catalytic domains, robustly suppressing its deubiquitination activity. Peptide treatments comprehensively blocked HAUSP, leading to p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in culture and to tumor regression in xenograft mouse model. Thus, the virus has developed a unique strategy to target the HAUSP-MDM2-p53 pathway, and these virus-derived short peptides represent biologically active HAUSP antagonists.",

Interestingly, infection of neuroblastoma tumor cell lines with Ews/Fli-1 switches the differentiation program of neuroblastomas to Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumors. Here we examined the status of cytoplasmically sequestered wt-p53 in neuroblastomas after stable expression of Ews/Fli-1. Immunofluorescence revealed that in the neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectant cell lines, p53 went from a punctate-pattern of cytoplasmic sequestration to increased nuclear localization. Western blot analysis revealed that PARC was down-regulated in one neuroblastoma cell line but not expressed in the second. Therefore, decreased PARC expression could not fully account for relieving p53 sequestration in the neuroblastoma tumor cells. Neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectant cell lines showed marked increases in p53 protein expression without transcriptional up-regulation. Interestingly, p53 was primarily phosphorylated, without activation of its downstream target p21(WAF1). Western blot analysis revealed that whereas MDM2 gene expression does not change, p14(ARF), a negative protein regulator of MDM2, increases. These observations suggest that the downstream p53 pathway may be inactivated as a result of abnormal p53. We also found that p53 has an extended half-life in the neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectants despite the retention of a wild-type sequence in neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectant cell lines. We then tested the p53 response pathway and observed that the neuroblastoma parent cells responded to genotoxic stress, whereas the neuroblastoma-Ews/Fli-1 infectants did not. These results suggest that Ews/Fli-1 can directly abrogate the p53 pathway to promote tumorigenesis. These studies also provide additional insight into the relationship among the p53 pathway proteins.",

Heretofore, fusion transcripts were mainly detected in frozen tissues, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In this study, we aimed to develop a reliable method to detect these in paraffin-embedded tissues, and to examine the clinicopathologic characteristics of a series of translocation-positive LGFMS. Sixty-three neoplasms with typical morphologic features of LGFMS and 66 non-LGFMS tumors selected for their resemblance to LGFMS (LGFMS-like tumors) were examined. RNA of sufficient quality could be extracted from 111/129 (86%) cases (59 LGFMS, 52 non-LGFMS). Of all, 48/59 (sensitivity, 81%) LGFMS contained detectable transcripts (45 FUS-CREB3L2, 3 FUS-CREB3L1). Most relevant clinicopathologic features of fusion-positive LGFMS included predominance in lower extremities (22/48; thigh: 13/48), deep situation (46/48), and occasional presence of unusual histologic features, for example, hypercellular areas (16/48), foci of epithelioid cells (13/48), and giant rosettes (6/48). Most tumors expressed EMA (41/45), at least focally, CD99 (38/41) and bcl-2 (36/41) while being essentially negative for CD34 (2/45), mdm2 (1/41), smooth muscle actin (1/45), S100 protein (0/46), desmin (0/44), h-caldesmon (0/42), keratins (0/44), and CD117 (0/40). Eleven presumed LGFMS were fusion negative. Of all, 7/52 non-LGMFS neoplasms contained FUS-CREB3L2 transcripts, of which 4 had been diagnosed as sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. In conclusion, FUS-CREB3L1/L2 fusion transcripts can be detected in paraffin-embedded LGFMS in a sensitive manner, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Most fusion-positive LGFMS are EMA-positive and CD34/S100/smooth muscle actin negative. The presence of epithelioid cells and fusion transcripts in both LGFMS and a subset of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma suggest that these neoplasms might be related.",

In previous studies we have shown osteosarcomas to lose p53 function with a corresponding loss of osteocalcin gene expression. Introduction of wild type p53 resulted in re expression of the osteocalcin gene. Using gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we have identified a putative p53 binding site within the rat OC promoter region and observed an increase in OC promoter activity when p53 accumulates using a CAT assay. The p53 inducible gene Mdm2 is a well-known downstream regulator of p53 levels. Our results showed a synergistic increase in the OC promoter activity when both p53 and MDM2 were transiently overexpressed. We further demonstrate that p53 is not degraded during overexpression of MDM2 protein. Increased OC expression was observed with concomitantly increased p53, VDR, and MDM2 levels in ROS17/2.8 cells during treatment with differentiation promoting (DP) media, but was significantly decreased when co-treated with DP media and the small molecule inhibitor of MDM2-p53 interaction, Nutlin-3. We have also observed a dramatic increase of the OC promoter activity in the presence of p53 and Mdm2 with inclusion of Cbfa-1 and p300 factors.

Paraffin-embedded tissue of 161 cases of MFH were studied immunohistochemically for the expression of the proliferation marker Ki-S1, cell cycle regulators (p53, MDM2, waf-1, pRb, p16) and the oncoprotein EGFR. The percentage of immunolabelled tumor cells (index) was assessed. The histologic grade was determined by the two-level grading systems of Costa, Tsujimoto and Pezzi, by the three-level grading systems of Coindre and Van Unnik and by the grading system presented here. Univariate analyses using the LOG rank test showed that all of the applied grading systems produce highly significant differences in survival between the grades of malignancy. Multivariate analyses with COX regression demonstrated that only the grading system presented here, based on the parameters necroses, mitoses and cellularity, had independent prognostic relevance. Moreover, the inclusion of the proposed grading system, the Ki-S1-index and a prognostic index primarily based on the expression of cell cycle regulators into the COX regression was suited for predicting survival in MFH. The grading system presented shows considerable advantages over the grading systems compared in this study for use in the routine pathology of MFH. The prognostic power of the proposed grading system can be enhanced by the combined study of cell cycle regulators and Ki-S1.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The chromosomal region 12q13-15 is recurrently amplified in osteosarcoma (OS), but its importance in bone tumor development remains unknown. Although there are two major candidate genes (MDM2, a TP53 downregulator, and CDK4, involved in cell cycle progression) considered to be the driving genes in this region, the size of the amplicon and number of genes involved have not been determined. In this study, we used 130 classical OS and 15 parosteal OS to determine MDM2 and CDK4 amplification frequency in OS. Tumors in which these genes were amplified were used to map the 12q13-15 amplified region and to determine its correlation with clinical prognosis. The 12q13-15 amplification was more prevalent in parosteal OS (67% of cases) than in high-grade classical OS (12%). Quantitative real-time PCR of MDM2, CDK4, and 25 other genes showed that this region contains two different amplicons: one at 12q15 centered on MDM2 and one at 12q13-14 centered on CDK4. Both regions were frequently co-amplified in both types of OS, and MDM2 and CDK4 amplification was correlated with higher expression levels for both genes. Univariate and multivariate analyses of clinical data indicated that classical OS patients whose tumors exhibited MDM2 amplification were more likely to be older at diagnosis (median age 32.6 vs. 17.8 years) and female (66.7 vs. 33.3%) than those without gene amplification. There was no association with other clinical parameters. In conclusion, co-amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 in two separate amplicons occurs frequently in parosteal OS and less so in classical high-grade OS.",

Cellular and viral microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in regulating gene expression. A better knowledge of the miRNA-mediated pathways affected by KSHV infection is therefore important for understanding viral infection and tumor pathogenesis. In this study, we used deep sequencing to analyze miRNA and cellular mRNA expression in a cell line with latent KSHV infection (SLKK) as compared to the uninfected SLK line. This approach revealed 153 differentially expressed human miRNAs, eight of which were independently confirmed by qRT-PCR. KSHV infection led to the dysregulation of ~15% of the human miRNA pool and most of these cellular miRNAs were down-regulated, including nearly all members of the 14q32 miRNA cluster, a genomic locus linked to cancer and that is deleted in a number of PEL cell lines. Furthermore, we identified 48 miRNAs that were associated with a total of 1,117 predicted or experimentally validated target mRNAs; of these mRNAs, a majority (73%) were inversely correlated to expression changes of their respective miRNAs, suggesting miRNA-mediated silencing mechanisms were involved in a number of these alterations. Several dysregulated miRNA-mRNA pairs may facilitate KSHV infection or tumor formation, such as up-regulated miR-708-5p, associated with a decrease in pro-apoptotic caspase-2 and leukemia inhibitory factor LIF, or down-regulated miR-409-5p, associated with an increase in the p53-inhibitor MDM2. Transfection of miRNA mimics provided further evidence that changes in miRNAs are driving some observed mRNA changes. Using filtered datasets, we also identified several canonical pathways that were significantly enriched in differentially expressed miRNA-mRNA pairs, such as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the interleukin-8 signaling pathways. Overall, our data provide a more detailed understanding of KSHV latency and guide further studies of the biological significance of these changes. ",

Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo effect of combined treatment of adenovirus-mediated E2F-1 and topoisomerase II inhibitors on the growth inhibition and apoptosis in human sarcoma cells. Two human sarcoma cell lines, OsACL and U2OS, were treated with topoisomerase II inhibitors (Etoposide and Adriamycin), alone or in combination with adenoviral vectors expressing beta-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ) or E2F-1 (Ad-E2F-1). E2F-1 expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Ad-E2F-1 gene transfer at a low dose (multiplicity of infection, 2) markedly increased the sensitivity of human sarcoma cells to topoisomerase II inhibitor treatment. This cooperative effect of E2F-1 and topoisomerase II inhibitors was less marked in SAOS-2 cells (p53 and pRb null). Topoisomerase II inhibitors also cooperated with E2F-1 overexpression to enhance tumor cell killing in an in vivo model using xenografts in nude mice. When combined with Adriamycin or Etoposide, E2F-1 adenovirus therapy resulted in approximately 95% and 85% decrease in tumor size, respectively, compared to controls (P<.05).

We have performed TP53 mutation/MDM2 amplification analyses in the largest series analyzed thus far, including DNA isolated from 37 alveolar and 38 embryonal RMS tumor samples obtained from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN). Available samples were frozen tumor tissues (N = 48) and histopathology slides. TP53 mutations in exons 4-9 were analyzed by direct sequencing in all samples, and MDM2 amplification analysis was performed by differential PCR on a subset of 22 samples. We found only one sample (1/75, 1.3%) carrying a TP53 mutation at codon 259 (p.D259Y) and no MDM2 amplification. Two SNPs in the TP53 pathway, associated with accelerated tumor onset in germline TP53 mutation carriers, (TP53 SNP72 (rs no. 1042522) and MDM2 SNP309 (rs no. 2279744)), were not found to confer earlier tumor onset.

Restoring expression of wild-type p53 has led to tumor growth suppression in a variety of tumor models that are p53 deficient.

Mdm2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for proteasomal degradation, is present at high levels in many tumors with wild-type p53. In this study, the effects of restoring p53 activity were probed in Mdm2-overexpressing tumors genetically using animal models. Here, it was demonstrated that elevated levels of Mdm2 and decreased levels of p53 act additively to dampen p53 activity in DNA damage response and tumor development. Our data further indicate that restoration of wild-type p53 expression in Mdm2-overexpressing angiosarcomas results in tumor stasis and regression in some cases. Finally, it was determined that restored p53 suppressed cell proliferation but did not elicit apoptosis in the Mdm2-overexpressing angiosarcomas.;Restoration of wild-type p53 expression in Mdm2-overexpressing tumors suppresses tumor growth, which represents a potential clinical strategy to treat tumors with high levels of Mdm2.",

The pRb pathway was targeted using CDKN2A/p16 overexpressing vectors and shRNA against CDK4 in chondrosarcoma cell lines OUMS27, SW1353, and CH2879. Cell survival and proliferation were assessed. CDK4, MDM2 and c-MYC expression levels were investigated by qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 34 fresh frozen and 90 FFPE samples of enchondroma and chondrosarcoma patients. On a subset of 29 high-grade chondrosarcomas IHC for cyclin D1, p21 and p53 was performed. The overexpression of CDKN2A/p16 and knockdown of CDK4 by shRNA in OUMS27, SW1353 and CH2879 resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability and proliferation and a decreased ability to form colonies in vitro. Expression of CDK4 and MDM2 was associated with high-grade chondrosarcoma both at the mRNA and protein level. Combining these results with the expression of cyclin D1 and the previously shown loss of CDKN2A/p16 expression show that the majority (96%; 28/29) of high-grade chondrosarcomas contain alterations in the pRb pathway.

Magnetic resonance imaging exhibited a large mass composed of two components with heterogeneous signal intensities, suggesting the coexistence of a fatty area and another soft tissue component. The grossly heterogeneous mass was histologically composed of an ALT/WDLS component transitioning abruptly into a dedifferentiated component.

The MIB-1 labeling index was extremely higher in the dedifferentiated area compared to the ALT/WDLS area. Cytogenetic analysis of the ALT/WDLS component revealed the following karyotype: 46,X,-Y,+r. Notably, cytogenetic analysis of the dedifferentiated component revealed a similar but more complex karyotype. Spectral karyotyping demonstrated that the ring chromosome was entirely composed of material from chromosome 12.

Here, we explore the importance of MDM2 amplification and p53 mutation in LPS independently, to determine whether HDACi are therapeutically useful in LPS. We demonstrated that simultaneous knockdown of MDM2 and p53 in p53-mutant LPS lines resulted in increased apoptosis, anti-proliferative effects, and cell cycle arrest, as compared to either intervention alone. HDACi treatment resulted in the dephosphorylation and depletion of MDM2 and p53 without affecting CDK4 and JUN expression, irrespective of p53 mutational status in MDM2-amplified LPS. In control mesothelioma cell lines, HDACi treatment resulted in down-regulation of p53 in the p53 mutant cell line JMN1B, but resulted in no changes of MDM2 and p53 in two mesothelioma lines with normal MDM2 and wild-type p53. HDACi treatment substantially decreased LPS and mesothelioma proliferation and survival, and was associated with upregulation of PTEN and p21, and inactivation of AKT. Our findings indicate that wild-type p53 depletion by HDACi is MDM2 amplification-dependent. These findings underscore the importance of targeting both MDM2 and p53 in LPS and other cancers harboring p53 mutations. Moreover, the pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effect of HDACi warrants further evaluation as a therapeutic strategy in MDM2-amplified LPS. ",

The products of these amplified genes are thought to provide cancer cells with a selective growth advantage; however, the specific gene(s) driving this amplicon is unknown. We have previously shown that the SAS gene is amplified in most parosteal osteosarcomas. In this study we analysed additional putative growth regulatory genes in this chromosomal region in 24 primary osteosarcoma specimens. CDK4 and SAS were coamplified in 6/6 parosteal tumors, and MDM2 was also amplified in 4/5 parosteal cases. In comparison, amplification occurred in only 2/16 classical intramedullary osteosarcomas and involved the SAS gene. Each amplified gene had a correspondingly elevated mRNA level. Four high grade intramedullary tumors had elevated mRNA expression of SAS, but did not exhibit gene amplification. Gene amplification/overexpression was not associated with metastatic disease and did not change markedly with tumor progression, as evidenced by analysis of sequential tumor specimens from eight patients. Three other genes in the 12q13-15 region (CDK2, WNT1 and WNT10b) were not amplified in any of the tumors. The different patterns of gene amplification and overexpression of CDK4, SAS and MDM2 in parosteal and intramedullary osteosarcomas may help explain the disparity in the biological behaviour of these two types of osteosarcoma.",

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for amplification of MDM2 has been considered the gold standard for diagnosis in these situations. Immunostaining for MDM2 and/or CDK4 has been adopted as a surrogate method because of its high concordance rate with FISH and lower cost. However, studies examining the concordance of the 2 methods have been based preferentially on cases in which the diagnosis could be established histologically. No study has explored the concordance between the 2 methods in histologically ambiguous cases or in cases in which the diagnosis of ALT/WDL is not apparent after a review of all slides. To address this, we performed immunostaining for MDM2 and CDK4 on 183 well-differentiated lipomatous tumors that could not be diagnosed on purely histologic grounds and that were, therefore, subjected to FISH analysis. These included ALT/WDLs (n=56), lipomas (n=96), and lipoma variants (n=31). Staining for MDM2 and CDK4 was noted in 25/56 and 23/56 ALT/WDL, respectively, giving a sensitivity of 45% and 41% and a specificity of 98% and 92%. Staining was noted exclusively in the nuclei of atypical cells and not in the nuclei of adipocytes. Staining for MDM2 and CDK4 occurred in 2/125 and 10/117 benign lipomatous lesions, respectively. False-positive staining was equivalent in intensity to ALT/WDL. We conclude that MDM2 and CDK4 staining is a relatively insensitive method for diagnosing ALT/WDL in cases that are histologically ambiguous, as staining is restricted to neoplastic cells with atypia that are underrepresented in these cases. Therefore, in cases like ours that closely simulate clinical practice, FISH is the more reliable and cost-effective option.",

Rarely, however, primary retroperitoneal liposarcoma is classified as myxoid/round cell liposarcoma, based on the presence of myxoid areas and vascular crow's feet pattern, which has resulted in a debate on the classification of liposarcoma in the retroperitoneum. Genetically, myxoid/round cell liposarcoma and well-/dedifferentiated liposarcoma are different diseases. Myxoid/round cell liposarcoma is characterized by a translocation causing FUS-CHOP or EWSR1-CHOP fusion, whereas well-/dedifferentiated liposarcoma is characterized by an amplification of the 12q13-15 region, including MDM2 and CDK4 genes. As myxoid/round cell liposarcoma is highly radio- and chemosensitive, differentiation between subtypes is important to optimize treatment. We studied whether primary retroperitoneal liposarcomas diagnosed as myxoid/round cell liposarcoma represent molecularly true myxoid/round cell liposarcoma or are histopathological mimics and represent well-/dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Primary retroperitoneal myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (n=16) were compared to primary extremity myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (n=20). Histopathological and immunohistochemical features were studied. Amplification status of the 12q13-15 region was studied using a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis, and FUS-CHOP or EWS-CHOP translocations were studied using RT-PCR. In primary retroperitoneal myxoid/round cell liposarcoma, MDM2 and CDK4 staining was both positive in 12 of 15 cases. In primary extremity myxoid/round cell liposarcoma, MDM2 was negative in 18/20 and CDK4 was negative in all cases. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification showed the amplification of 12q13-15 region in 16/16 primary retroperitoneal myxoid/round cell liposarcomas and in 1/20 primary extremity myxoid/round cell liposarcomas. Translocation was present in all (18/18) primary extremity myxoid/round cell liposarcomas, but absent in all primary retroperitoneal myxoid/round cell liposarcomas. On the basis of immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics, apparent primary retroperitoneal myxoid/round cell liposarcoma can be recognized as well-/dedifferentiated liposarcoma with morphological features mimicking myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. In these cases, treatment should probably be specifically designed as for well-/dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Moreover, finding of myxoid/round cell liposarcoma translocations in a retroperitoneal localization is highly suggestive of metastasis and should prompt search for a primary localization outside the retroperitoneum.",

Both MDM2 and MDMX function as powerful oncogenes and are commonly over-expressed in some cancers, including sarcoma (~20%) and breast cancer (~15%). In contrast to tumors that are p53 mutant, whereby the current therapeutic strategy restores the normal active conformation of p53, MDM2 and MDMX represent logical therapeutic targets in cancer for increasing wild-type (WT) p53 expression and activities. Recent preclinical studies suggest that there may also be situations that MDM2/X inhibitors could be used in p53 mutant tumors. Since the discovery of nutlin-3a, the first in a class of small molecule MDM2 inhibitors that binds to the hydrophobic cleft in the N-terminus of MDM2, preventing its association with p53, there is now an extensive list of related compounds. In addition, a new class of stapled peptides that can target both MDM2 and MDMX have also been developed. Importantly, preclinical modeling, which has demonstrated effective in vitro and in vivo killing of WT p53 cancer cells, has now been translated into early clinical trials allowing better assessment of their biological effects and toxicities in patients. In this overview, we will review the current MDM2- and MDMX-targeted therapies in development, focusing particularly on compounds that have entered into early phase clinical trials. We will highlight the challenges pertaining to predictive biomarkers for and toxicities associated with these compounds, as well as identify potential combinatorial strategies to enhance its anti-cancer efficacy.

To further define the role of c-Jun in liposarcoma progression, we performed immunohistochemistry for c-Jun and its activating kinase ASK1 on a series of liposarcomas (n = 81). We correlated the results with fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect c-Jun amplification. We also derived new cell lines from dedifferentiated liposarcomas with c-Jun amplification. c-Jun protein is expressed in the majority of dedifferentiated liposarcomas (91%) and their well-differentiated components (59%), but only in the minority of pure well-differentiated liposarcomas (27%). When c-Jun is amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, it is interspersed with amplified MDM2 on ring and giant marker chromosomes. MDM2 amplification is one of the earliest events in liposarcoma development, and these results suggest that c-Jun was amplified at a similar time in the evolution of the tumour. In addition, shRNA to c-Jun in c-Jun-amplified liposarcoma cells reduces cell number in vitro and inhibits tumour formation in vivo without an observable effect on the differentiation state of the liposarcoma cells. Thus, c-Jun amplification is oncogenic in liposarcomas but not always sufficient for inhibition of adipocytic differentiation.",

One significant binding protein identified was Hep27, a member of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family of enzymes. Here, we demonstrate that the Hep27 preprotein contains an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal that is cleaved following mitochondrial import, resulting in mitochondrial matrix accumulation of mature Hep27. A fraction of the mitochondrial Hep27 translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to Mdm2 in the central domain, resulting in the attenuation of Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. In addition, Hep27 is regulated at the transcriptional level by the proto-oncogene c-Myb and is required for c-Myb-induced p53 stabilization. Breast cancer gene expression analysis correlated estrogen receptor (ER) status with Hep27 expression and p53 function, providing a potential in vivo link between estrogen receptor signaling and p53 activity.

Currently, the most reliable technique for determining a patients' prognosis is measurement of histopathologic tumor necrosis following pre-operative neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Unfavourable prognosis is indicated by less than 90% estimated necrosis of the tumor. Neither genetic testing nor molecular biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis have been described for osteosarcomas. We used the novel nanoString mRNA digital expression analysis system to analyse gene expression in 32 patients with sporadic paediatric osteosarcoma. This system used specific molecular barcodes to quantify expression of a set of 17 genes associated with osteosarcoma tumorigenesis. Five genes, from this panel, which encoded the bone differentiation regulator RUNX2, the cell cycle regulator CDC5L, the TP53 transcriptional inactivator MDM2, the DNA helicase RECQL4, and the cyclin-dependent kinase gene CDK4, were differentially expressed in tumors that responded poorly to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Analysis of the signalling relationships of these genes, as well as other expression markers of osteosarcoma, indicated that gene networks linked to RB1, TP53, PI3K, PTEN/Akt, myc and RECQL4 are associated with osteosarcoma. The discovery of these networks provides a basis for further experimental studies of role of the five genes (RUNX2, CDC5L, MDM2, RECQL4, and CDK4) in differential response to chemotherapy. ",

However, a subgroup of low-grade, parosteal tumors exhibits a relatively simple aberration pattern dominated by ring chromosomes carrying amplified material from chromosome 12. To assess whether sequences from this chromosome were differentially amplified in low- and high-grade osteosarcomas, copy numbers of the CCND2, ETV6, KRAS2, and D12S85 regions in 12p and the MDM2 region in 12q were evaluated by interphase or metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 24 osteosarcomas. Amplification of MDM2 was detected in all five low-grade and four high-grade osteosarcomas, all of which showed ring chromosomes. An overrepresentation of 12p sequences was found in 1/5 low-grade and in 9/19 high-grade tumors. Multicolor single-copy FISH analysis of metaphase cells from six high-grade tumors showed that extra 12p material either occurred together with MDM2 in ring chromosomes or was scattered over the genome as a result of complex structural rearrangements. Most tumors (8/10) not containing amplification of the assessed chromosome 12 loci exhibited a nondiploid pattern at evaluation with probes for centromeric alpha satellite sequences. These findings indicate that gain of sequences from the short arm of chromosome 12 could be a possible genetic pathway in the development of aggressive osteosarcoma.",

It is amplified or overexpressed in many human cancers, including breast cancer, and MDM2 levels are associated with poor prognosis of several human cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, osteosarcoma, and lymphoma. In the present study, we investigated the functions of MDM2 oncogene in the growth of breast cancer and the potential value of MDM2 as a drug target for cancer therapy by inhibiting MDM2 expression with a specific antisense antihuman-MDM2 oligonucleotide (oligo). The selected antisense mixed-backbone oligo was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity in human breast cancer models: MCF-7 cell line containing wild-type p53 and MDA-MB-468 cell line containing mutant p53. In MCF-7 cells, p53 and p21 levels were elevated, resulting from specific inhibition of MDM2 expression by the antisense oligo (AS). In MDA-MB-468 cells, after inhibition of MDM2 expression, p21 levels were elevated, although p53 levels remained unchanged. After i.p. administration of the antisense anti-MDM2 oligo, in vivo antitumor activity occurred in a dose-dependent manner in nude mice bearing MCF-7 or MDA-MB-468 xenografts. In both models, in vivo synergistically or additive therapeutic effects of MDM2 inhibition and the clinically used cancer chemotherapeutic agents irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and paclitaxel (Taxol) were observed. These results suggest that MDM2 have a role in tumor growth through both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. We speculate that MDM2 inhibitors, such as ASs, have a broad spectrum of antitumor activities in human breast cancers, regardless of p53 status. This study should provide a basis for future development of anti-MDM2 ASs as cancer therapeutic agents used alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics.",

We herein describe 9 cases of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma with distinct areas of fibroosseous tissue histologically indistinguishable from low-grade osteosarcomas, that is, parosteal osteosarcoma or low-grade central osteosarcoma. The tumors affected middle-aged to elderly patients, and occurred in the retroperitoneum and deep soft tissue of the extremities without connection to the skeletal system. Grossly, all the tumors showed biphasic appearance with lipogenic and osteogenic area, the latter representing 5% to 50% of the total tumor volume. Histologically, the lipogenic component exhibited typical histology of well-differentiated liposarcoma, whereas the osteogenic area consisted of fibroosseous tissue with numerous mature neoplastic bone trabeculae largely lacking osteoblastic rimming, with intervening fascicles of spindle cell proliferation showing low nuclear grade. All samples were positive for MDM2 and/or CDK4 on immunohistochemical analysis; the antibodies stained many osteocytes, indicating that the bone is neoplastic rather than reactive. Three cases showed high-grade osteosarcomatous transformation juxtaposed to the low-grade osteosarcomatous component, reminiscent of the \"dedifferentiation\" phenomenon of skeletal low-grade osteosarcoma. Follow-up revealed local recurrence in 4 cases, but no distant metastases were documented. Recognition of this earlier underappreciated subtype of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma is important, because the fibroosseous component may seem so bland that it may be confused with benign metaplasia such as myositis ossificans, or conversely, the lipomatous component may be inconspicuous that it may be dismissed as normal fat, and such misinterpretation may potentially result in suboptimal treatment.",

Overexpression of MTBP leads to p53-independent cell proliferation arrest, which is in turn blocked by simultaneous overexpression of MDM2. Importantly, reduced expression of MTBP in mice increases tumor metastasis and enhances migratory potential of mouse embryonic fibroblasts regardless of the presence of p53. Clinically, loss of MTBP expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is associated with reduced patient survival, and is shown to serve as an independent prognostic factor when p53 is mutated in tumors. These results indicate the involvement of MTBP in suppressing tumor progression. Our recent findings demonstrate that overexpression of MTBP in human osteosarcoma cells lacking wild-type p53 inhibits metastasis, but not primary tumor growth, when cells are transplanted in femurs of immunocompromised mice. These data indicate that MTBP functions as a metastasis suppressor independent of p53 status. Furthermore, overexpression of MTBP suppresses cell migration and filopodia formation, in part, by inhibiting function of an actin crosslinking protein α-actinin-4. Thus, increasing evidence indicates the significance of MTBP in tumor progression.

In tissue culture, MTBP inhibits Mdm2 self-ubiquitination, leading to stabilization of Mdm2 and increased degradation of p53. To address the role of MTBP in the regulation of the p53 pathway in vivo, we deleted the Mtbp gene in mice. Homozygous disruption of Mtbp resulted in early embryonic lethality, which was not rescued by loss of p53. Mtbp+/- mice were not tumor prone. When mice were sensitized for tumor development by p53 heterozygosity, we found that the Mtbp+/-p53+/- mice developed significantly more metastatic tumors (18.2%) as compared to p53+/- mice (2.6%). Results of in vitro migration and invasion assays support the in vivo findings. Downmodulation of Mtbp in osteosarcoma cells derived from p53+/- mice resulted in increased invasiveness, and overexpression of Mtbp in Mtbp+/-p53+/- osteosarcoma cells inhibited invasiveness.

Moreover, this feature may have consequences for treatment choice and prognosis. Here, we have dissected the molecular relation of tumor components in cases of mixed-type liposarcoma. On the basis of heterogeneous preoperative magnetic resonance image (MRI) features, eight cases of mixed-type liposarcoma were selected. Preoperative biopsy samples and resection specimens were analyzed including molecular and immunohistochemical analysis on all components. As controls, cases with homogeneous MRI features and uniform aspects of myxoid liposarcoma (n = 5), round cell liposarcoma (n = 5) and well-differentiated liposarcoma (n = 5) were studied. All patients with heterogeneous MRI features showed morphological components of myxoid liposarcoma and well-differentiated liposarcoma. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed FUS-DDIT3 fusion in both components in five of eight cases in the absence (zero of five) of MDM2 and CDK4 amplification. In three of eight patients, MDM2 and/or CDK4 were overexpressed, and amplification was shown by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in the absence of myxoid liposarcoma translocations. All control patients showed a molecular pattern consistent with their morphological features. Therefore, mixed-type liposarcomas should not be regarded as collision tumors, but as an extreme variant of the morphological spectrum within a single biological entity, explaining the biological contradiction of mixed-type liposarcoma. For treatment stratification, detailed classification including molecular support should be performed in tumors with heterogeneous MRI features.",

This study was undertaken to determine whether, in leiomyosarcomas (LMS) occurring in different anatomic locations, there were differences in patterns of expression of molecules that have been demonstrated to be associated with biologically aggressive behavior in malignant neoplasms, and also to determine their diagnostic utility. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were selected from 16 extrauterine leiomyosarcomas (EULMS), 14 cases of uterine leiomyosarcomas (ULMS) and from five cases each of uterine and extrauterine leiomyomas (LM). Utilizing immunohistochemical (ABC) techniques with antigen retrieval, we assessed serial sections of each tumor for immunoreactivity with Glut1, CD44s, bcl2, cyclin D1, and estrogen receptor. Molecular genotyping for detecting k-ras-2 point mutation, p53 gene loss, and mdm2 gene amplification was performed on microdissected tumor samples from the same histologic sections. All of the uterine and extrauterine LM were diffusely positive for CD44s, bcl2, and cyclin D1, and uniformly negative for Glut1. In contrast, 50% of the ULMS and 25% of EULMS were Glutl positive. Moreover, Glut1 positivity closely correlated with aggressive biologic behavior reflected by distant metastatic spread. Eighty-percent of LM and 70% of the ULMS were estrogen receptor positive, whereas only one retroperitoneal tumor had focal weak positivity. Over 80% of the extrauterine and 50% of the uterine sarcomas showed absence of CD44s immunoreactivity. Percentage of cyclin D1 immunoreactivity was independent of tumor grade and inversely proportional to the percent of bcl2 positivity. An LMS of the male breast contained k-ras-2 exon 1 point mutation (codon 12 aspartate substitution of glycine). P53 allelic imbalance was present in 29% of ULMS and 57% EULMS. Mdm2 amplification was present in three of six EULMS but not in ULMS. In addition to clinical staging, Glut1 positivity together with patterns of immunoreactivity of CD44 and bcl2 may be helpful in identifying aggressive smooth muscle tumors of the uterus and some EULMS. The presence of estrogen receptor staining may be helpful in identifying uterine versus nonuterine LMS. Although sample numbers are too small for definite conclusions, this study suggests that there are differences in glucose transport, expression of adhesion molecules, and estrogen receptors in ULMS and EULMS, which in part may be due to the estrogen dependency of the ULMS. P53 mutations and mdm2 amplifications appear to be more frequent in EULMS.",

In this case we present a 73-year-old male patient who was admitted due to loss of weight, anorexia and postprandial emesis with dysphagy. Gastrographin esophagography failed to make precise diagnostics. CT scan of the upper gastrointestinal tract revealed a large esophageal tumor filling out the whole length of the esophagus. The tumor was removed by parasternocleidomastoidal approach with a stapler. Histopathological examination revealed a well-differentiated liposarcoma (grade I). Well-differentiated liposarcomas are characterised by amplified material of the 12q13-15 chromosomal region, present in the form of giant or ring chromosomes and leading to the overexpression of MDM2 and CDK4 genes. MDM2 and CDK4 proteins can be detected immunhistochemically, which was the case in the reported tumor.

No single histological or clinical parameter can predict the prognosis while the response to therapy is related to the type of KIT or PDGFRA mutation. Cytogenetic and CGH studies have identified frequent gross chromosomal aberrations but the target genes of these changes are unknown. To determine whether known oncogenes take part in genomic rearrangements and to investigate the potential clinical significance of their amplifications, nine known oncogenes (CMYC, MDM2, GLI1, CDK4, HER2, EGFR1, CCND1, FGF3, EMS) were analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 94 primary GIST. Clinical follow-up information was available for 57 of these patients. Amplification was found for CMYC in three of 90 (3.3%), for MDM2 in five of 94 (5.3%), for EGFR1 in five of 94 (5.3%), and for CCND1 in seven of 79 (8.9%) evaluable cases. No amplifications were seen for HER2, GLI1, CDK4, FGF3, and EMS. Amplifications of MDM2 and CCND1 were associated with clinical and histological malignancy. In conclusion, our data show that gene amplification does occur in a subset of GIST. Identification of MDM2/CCND1 amplification may represent another molecular feature that could help in the evaluation of the behavior of GISTs.",

In the present study, the expression pattern of 10 selected cell cycle components is investigated in a series of 15 MPNSTs from patients with (n = 9) or without (n = 5) neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Thirteen tumors did not express the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p16(INK4A), an observation that was related to homozygote gene deletions in three tumors, heterozygote deletions in five, and gross gene rearrangements in five. The absence of protein expression in the tumors with one seemingly intact allele was not caused by promoter hypermethylation of p16(INK4A) or p14(ARF). All tumor samples expressed normal sized RB1, cyclin D3, CDK2, CDK4, p21(CIP1), and p27(KlP1) proteins, and only a single tumor showed an aberrant protein band for one of these proteins, p21(CIP1). Cyclin D1 was absent in four tumors; all except one tumor showed expression of TP53 protein, and three of nine MPNSTs had expression of normal-sized MDM2. In conclusion, this study shows that the vast majority of MPNSTs had gross rearrangements of the p16(INK4A) gene, explaining the absence of the encoded protein in the same tumors. The level of expression was equally distributed between the familial (NF1) and sporadic cases, although it should be noted that the 2 cases with p16(INK4A) expression were sporadic. The data imply that the complete absence of p16(INK4A) is sufficient for activation of the cell cycle in most MPNSTs; thus, it is not necessary for tumor proliferation to further stimulate the cycle through alteration of other central components.",

The tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to various stresses. p53 protein levels are regulated by MDM2 through ubiquitin-dependent degradation. In this study, we evaluated whether nutlin-3, a recently developed small-molecule antagonist of MDM2, has an effect on p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cultured human RMS cell lines.;Five RMS cell lines with different p53 statuses and MDM2 expression levels were treated with nutlin-3. Gene expression patterns, cell viability, cell cycle, and apoptosis after nutlin-3 treatment, and antitumor activity of combination treatment with vincristine or actinomycin D were assessed.;Significant p53 activation was observed in wild-type p53 cell lines after nutlin-3 treatment. p53 activation led to cell cycle arrest in parallel with increased p21 expression. Furthermore, these cell lines underwent p53-dependent apoptosis, concomitant with elevation of proapoptotic genes and activation of caspase-3. The effect of nutlin-3 was almost the same in terms of half maximal inhibitory concentration and apoptosis whether or not MDM2 was overexpressed. Nutlin-3 did not induce either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in p53 mutant cell lines. A combination of vincristine or actinomycin D with nutlin-3 enhanced the antitumor activity in RMS cell lines with wild-type p53.;Nutlin-3 effectively restored p53 function in both normal MDM2 expression and MDM2 overexpression RMS cell lines with wild-type p53. p53 restoration therapy is a potential therapeutic strategy for refractory RMS with wild-type p53.",

In this study, 23 cases of OS (15 osteoblastic and 8 MFH-like types) and 18 cases of MFH of bone in patients 40 years of age or older were analyzed for mutation of the p53 gene, amplification of the MDM2 gene, and mutation of the H-ras gene, using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded materials. We also examined the expression of p53, MDM2, and p21WAF1 protein immunohistochemically and assessed the proliferative activities using the monoclonal antibody MIB-1. p53 immunoreactivity was recognized in 5 of 23 OS cases (22%), whereas p53 gene mutations were also detected in 5 of 23 OS cases (22%; osteoblastic [4/15; 27%] and MFH-like [1/8; 18%] types) and in 4 of 18 cases of MFH of bone (22%). There was a statistically significant correlation between p53 immunoreactivity and p53 mutation status in OS (P =.0482). All those cases of osteoblastic OS and MFH of bone that had p53 mutations, with the exception of one case of MFH of bone that had a silent mutation, showed aggressive biologic behavior (dead of disease within 12 mo), in contrast to the MFH-like OS cases (alive without disease at 22 mo). Three cases of OS (13%) and three cases of MFH of bone (17%) showed immunoreactivity for MDM2. As for gene alteration, three cases of OS (13%) and 3 cases of MFH of bone (17%) demonstrated MDM2 amplification. MDM2 amplification showed a significant correlation with the expression of MDM2 protein in OS (P =.0344). p21WAF1 expression was detected in three cases of OS (13%) and in six cases of MFH of bone (33%). MDM2 alteration and p21WAF1 expression were not observed in any of the cases of MFH-like OS. MIB-1-LI showed a statistically significant correlation with p53 immunoreactivity and MDM2 immunoreactivity in OS (P =.0307 and P =.0358, respectively). H-ras mutation at Codons 12 and 13 was not recognized in any of the cases of OS or MFH of bone. In conclusion, although treatment differences during the time of study make it difficult to compare survival analysis, in the current study, p53 mutation in osteoblastic OS and MFH of bone in elderly patients seemed to be closely associated with the progression of the tumor, which was not the case in MFH-like OS. Furthermore, MDM2 alteration and p21WAF1 expression were demonstrated only in osteoblastic OS and MFH of bone, whereas they were not recognized in MFH-like OS. Although the number of patients in this analysis was small, it would appear that MFH-like OS may have some characteristic biologic aspects when compared with osteoblastic OS and MFH of bone in elderly patients.",

Herein, we describe that an accumulation of ceramide, achieved through the exogenous application of C(6)-ceramide or exposure to sphingomyelinase, induces a G(2) arrest in Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cell lines. Utilizing the RMS cell line RD, we show that this G(2) arrest required the rapid induction of p21(Cip1/Waf1) independent of DNA damage. This was followed at later time points (48 h) by the commitment to apoptosis. Apoptosis was prevented by Bcl-2 overexpression, but permitted the maintenance of elevated p21(Cip1/Waf1) protein expression and the stabilization of the G(2) arrest response. Inhibition of p21(Cip1/Waf1) protein synthesis with cyclohexamide (CHX) or silencing of p21(Cip1/Waf1) with siRNA, prevented ceramide-mediated G(2) arrest and the late induction of apoptosis. Further, adopting the recent discovery that murine double minute 2 (MDM2) controls p21(Cip1/Waf1) expression by presenting this CDK inhibitor to the proteasome for degradation, RD cells overexpressing MDM2 abrogated ceramide-mediated p21(Cip1/Waf1) induction, G(2) arrest and the late ensuing apoptosis. Collectively, these data further support the notion that ceramide accumulation can modulate cell cycle progression. Additionally, these observations highlight MDM2 expression and proteasomal activity as key determinants of the cellular response to ceramide accumulation.",

By using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found that genomic aberrations expected to be alternative mechanisms for compensating the lack of CDK4 amplification, such as RB1 and CDKN2A deletions or CCND1 amplification, were very uncommon. In contrast, by using real time quantitative reverse transcription PCR and immunohistochemistry, we observed that overexpression of P16INK4a (and P14ARF) and CCND1 and reduced expression of RB1 were very frequent, independently of the CDK4 status.;Our results underscore the complex coordinated regulation of the RB and p53 growth-control pathways in WDLPS/DDLPS. Because the absence of CDK4 amplification is not specifically counterbalanced by a genomic alteration of the CCND1/CDK4/P16INK4a/RB1/E2F pathway, CDK4 amplification may only represent a \"MDM2-HMGA2-helper\" in WDLPS/DDLPS tumorigenesis.",

From 1980 through 2002, 34 individuals displaying WDL were treated in our institutions. Lipoma was observed in seven of these 34 patients (five men and two women, mean age of 66.7 years). The rate of co-existence of lipoma in WDL [20.6% (7/34)] cases was significantly higher than the corresponding rate in the other liposarcoma subtypes [2.5% (1/40)]. Immunohistochemically, cdk4 was positive in all WDLs (100%). ki-67 was positive in 57.1% (4/7) and mdm2 and p53 were positive in 14.5% (1/7) of the WDL cases. Weak cdk4 immunoreactivity was detected in two lipomas. All lipomas were negative for mdm2, p53 and ki-67. Comparison of the expression profile in these malignant and benign tumors, which had arisen in identical genetic backgrounds, confirmed the involvement of these proteins, especially cdk4, in the tumorigenesis process of WDL.",

Their age ranges from 11 to 33 years, with peak incidence in the second decade and equal sex distribution. Seventy-five percent presented with pain, commonest in the knee, affecting the metaphysis. Most appeared radiologically as well-circumscribed expansile multiloculated osteolytic lesions, and many are displayed periosteal reaction. They showed several distinct histologic patterns: the stromal and giant cell, fibrohistiocytic, aneurysmal-cystic, osteoblastoma-like, and parosteal and fibrous dysplasia-like patterns. Focal subtle lacelike osteoid deposition, permeative infiltration into adjacent native bony trabeculae and over 30 % Ki67 proliferative index were characteristic. There was no CDK4 and MDM2 amplification. In those having bisphosphonate and denosumab treatment, there was limited focal necrosis with reduction in the number of giant cells and broad trabecular woven bone formation but no giant osteoclast was seen. Two patients with initial diagnosis of giant cell tumor treated by curettage and local resection pursued aggressive clinical courses, died after 14 and 21 months. The others survived 12 to 110 months. GCRO accounts for about 3 % of all osteosarcomas and apart from its more frequent diaphyseal location and associated normal bone-specific alkaline phosphate levels; it shares with conventional high-grade osteosarcoma the same patient demographics, sites of occurrence, absence of CDK4 and MDM2 amplification, and probably clinical course.

They represent the second malignant primary bone tumor of adults after osteosarcoma, but in contrast to osteosarcoma they are resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, surgical excision remaining the only therapeutic option. Few cell lines and animal models are available, and the mechanisms behind their chemoresistance remain largely unknown. Our goal was to establish new cell lines and animal cancer models from human chondrosarcoma biopsies to study their chemoresistance. Between 2007 and 2012, 10 chondrosarcoma biopsies were collected and used for cell culture and transplantation into nude mice. Only one transplanted biopsy and one injected cell line has engrafted successfully leading to conventional central high-grade chondrosarcoma similar to the original biopsies. In culture, two new stable cell lines were obtained, one from a dedifferentiated and one from a grade III conventional central chondrosarcoma biopsy. Their genetic characterization revealed triploid karyotypes, mutations in IDH1, IDH2, and TP53, deletion in CDKN2A and/or MDM2 amplification. These cell lines expressed mesenchymal membrane markers (CD44, 73, 90, 105) and were able to produce a hyaline cartilaginous matrix when cultured in chondrogenic three-dimensional (3D) pellets. Using a high-throughput quantitative RT-PCR approach, we observed that cell lines cultured in monolayer had lost expression of several genes implicated in cartilage development (COL2A1, COMP, ACAN) but restored their expression in 3D cultures. Chondrosarcoma cells in monolayer were sensitive to several conventional chemotherapeutic agents but became resistant to low doses of mafosfamide or doxorubicin when cultured in 3D pellets, in parallel with an altered nucleic accumulation of the drug. Our results indicate that the cartilaginous matrix produced by chondrosarcoma cells may impair diffusion of several drugs and thus contribute to chemoresistance. Therefore, 3D chondrogenic cell pellets constitute a more relevant model to study chondrosarcoma chemoresistance and may be a valuable alternative to animal experimentations. ",

Here, we attempt to accelerate the identification of functional p53 pathway SNPs by incorporating these characteristics into an analysis of 142 genes that are known to affect p53 signaling.;We report that a genomic scan for recent natural selection denotes that of the 142 genes studied, the PPP2R5E gene that encodes a regulatory subunit of the tumor suppressing protein phosphatase 2A resides in a naturally selected genomic region.

Recently, we identified the first potent and selective low molecular weight inhibitors of MDM2-p53 binding, the Nutlins. These molecules activate the p53 pathway and suppress tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. They represent valuable new tools for studying the p53 pathway and its defects in cancer.

To understand the toxicology of these alloys, male F344 rats were intramuscularly implanted with pellets of tungsten/nickel/cobalt, tungsten/nickel/iron, or pure tungsten, with tantalum pellets as a negative control. Between 6 and 12 months, aggressive rhabdomyosarcomas formed around tungsten/nickel/cobalt pellets, while those of tungsten/nickel/iron or pure tungsten did not cause cancers. Electron microscopy showed a progressive corrosion of the matrix phase of tungsten/nickel/cobalt pellets over 6 months, accompanied by high urinary concentrations of nickel and cobalt. In contrast, non-carcinogenic tungsten/nickel/iron pellets were minimally corroded and urinary metals were low; these pellets having developed a surface oxide layer in vivo that may have restricted the mobilization of carcinogenic nickel. Microarray analysis of tumors revealed large changes in gene expression compared with normal muscle, with biological processes involving the cell cycle significantly up-regulated and those involved with muscle development and differentiation significantly down-regulated. Top KEGG pathways disrupted were adherens junction, p53 signaling, and the cell cycle. Chromosomal enrichment analysis of genes showed a highly significant impact at cytoband 7q22 (chromosome 7) which included mouse double minute (MDM2) and cyclin-dependant kinase (CDK4) as well as other genes associated with human sarcomas. In conclusion, the tumorigenic potential of implanted tungsten alloys is related to mobilization of carcinogenic metals nickel and cobalt from corroding pellets, while gene expression changes in the consequent tumors are similar to radiation induced animal sarcomas as well as sporadic human sarcomas.",

Molecular cytogenetic studies on osteosarcomas have shown that genomic amplification, especially of both the TP53-binding MDM2 gene and the flanking SAS gene, plays an important role in the biology of these tumors. We applied CGH in order to obtain a global view of DNA-sequence losses and gains in osteosarcoma. CGH was performed on 20 high-grade medullary osteosarcomas (13 primary tumors prior to chemotherapy, 5 tumors after chemotherapy, 2 established cell lines [MB63, HOS58]) using genomic DNA of snap-frozen tumor specimens. CGH revealed DNA copy number aberrations, mostly gains, in all the tumors studied with an average of 18.5 aberrations/tumor (range 8-32). High-level amplifications were observed in all cases (average 4.1 amplifications/tumor [range 1-10]). Amplicons affecting at least five tumors were mapped to 1p21-31 (9/20 cases), 3q25-qter (6/20), 6p12-21 (6/20), 8q12-qter (10/20), 12p11-12 (9/20), 12q12-15 (enclosing MDM2 and SAS loci, 7/20). Losses were most frequently seen at 3p, 10q, 11p and 13 (all 10/20). In conclusion, our CGH data indicated that genomic amplification plays an important role in the biology of osteosarcoma. CGH demonstrated the complexity of genetic aberrations in osteosarcomas. The detection of novel non-random DNA amplifications in our study has defined regions for further targeted molecular genetic research aimed at identifying those oncogenes that are characteristic of osteosarcoma development.",

The tumor was resected and histologically diagnosed as conventional DDLPS, in which dedifferentiated component was highly cellular and composed of pleomorphic anaplastic cells. After 3 years, the tumor recurred in the right retroperitoneal space. The recurrent tumor consisted of 2 components: lipogenic and nonlipogenic. The latter differ from the dedifferentiated component of the primary tumor. The tumor cells were small, round to ovoid cells with monomorphous, round, hyperchromatic nuclei, and scant cytoplasm. Interestingly, they were diffusely positive for myogenin and desmin. To rule out the possibility of the second primary, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect FOXO1 rearrangement. We failed to demonstrate splits of the probes. In contrast, high-level amplification of MDM2 was detected by dual-color in situ hybridization. Given the morphologic and molecular findings, the neoplasm was identified as a peculiar DDLPS mimicking rhabdomyosarcoma.

In this study, we report a novel small-molecule inhibitor of the MDM2-p53 interaction, SAR405838 (MI-77301), that has been advanced into phase I clinical trials. SAR405838 binds to MDM2 with K(i) = 0.88 nmol/L and has high specificity over other proteins. A cocrystal structure of the SAR405838:MDM2 complex shows that, in addition to mimicking three key p53 amino acid residues, the inhibitor captures additional interactions not observed in the p53-MDM2 complex and induces refolding of the short, unstructured MDM2 N-terminal region to achieve its high affinity. SAR405838 effectively activates wild-type p53 in vitro and in xenograft tumor tissue of leukemia and solid tumors, leading to p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. At well-tolerated dose schedules, SAR405838 achieves either durable tumor regression or complete tumor growth inhibition in mouse xenograft models of SJSA-1 osteosarcoma, RS4;11 acute leukemia, LNCaP prostate cancer, and HCT-116 colon cancer. Remarkably, a single oral dose of SAR405838 is sufficient to achieve complete tumor regression in the SJSA-1 model. Mechanistically, robust transcriptional upregulation of PUMA induced by SAR405838 results in strong apoptosis in tumor tissue, leading to complete tumor regression. Our findings provide a preclinical basis upon which to evaluate SAR405838 as a therapeutic agent in patients whose tumors retain wild-type p53.",

We have analyzed three metastases from a patient with high-grade metastatic dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) by exome and transcriptome sequencing as well as DNA copy number analysis. Genomic aberrations of several potentially targetable genes, including amplification of KITLG and FRS2, in addition to amplification of CDK4 and MDM2, characteristic of this disease, were identified. We evaluated the efficacy of drugs targeting these aberrations or the corresponding signaling pathways in a cell line derived from the patient. Interestingly, the pan-FGFR inhibitor NVP-BGJ398, which targets FGFR upstream of FRS2, strongly inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and induced an accumulation of cells into the G0 phase of the cell cycle. This study indicates that FGFR inhibitors have therapeutic potential in the treatment of DDLPS with amplified FRS2.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (LPS) is a malignant adipocytic neoplasm defined as the transition from well-differentiated LPS to a nonlipogenic sarcoma. Heterologous differentiation is seen in 5% to 10% of dedifferentiated LPS, usually with myogenic or osteo/chondrosarcomatous elements. Adipocytic differentiation in the dedifferentiated component is incompatible with the current definition of dedifferentiated LPS. Pleomorphic LPS is a high-grade sarcoma containing lipoblasts. At least in areas, pleomorphic LPS can be indistinguishable from dedifferentiated LPS, except for the presence of lipoblasts in pleomorphic LPS and well-differentiated LPS areas in dedifferentiated LPS. We evaluated 12 unusual liposarcomas: 11 cases with pleomorphic LPS-like morphology affecting patients with concomitant or previous well-differentiated/dedifferentiated LPS, and 1 case resembling inflammatory \"MFH\" with scattered lipoblasts. Clinical and histologic features were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry for MDM2 and CDK4 was carried out. Amplification of 12q13 to q15 was studied by FISH analysis of the HMGA2 locus. The tumors arose in the retroperitoneum (7), proximal lower extremity (3), chest wall (1), and neck (1) of 9 males and 3 females (median age 66 y; range 49 to 76). Size ranged from 9 to 32 cm (median 23 cm). In 3 cases, there was an abrupt transition between well-differentiated LPS and sheets of pleomorphic lipoblasts, indistinguishable from pleomorphic LPS. Four cases consisted of otherwise typical dedifferentiated LPS (with adjacent well-differentiated LPS), except for the presence of lipoblasts in the high-grade component. One case contained both nonlipogenic spindle cell areas and an inflammatory \"MFH\"-like component with numerous admixed lipoblasts. Four cases were composed exclusively of pleomorphic LPS-like areas developing in 1 of the recurrences or metastases of a prior typical dedifferentiated LPS. Two cases also showed heterologous smooth muscle differentiation. MDM2 and CDK4 were positive in both the dedifferentiated LPS and pleomorphic LPS-like components in 12/12 and 11/12 cases, respectively. FISH analysis showed high-level amplification of 12q14.3 in all 8 cases successfully tested. Karyotypes were available for 3 cases and showed ring and giant marker chromosomes. Follow-up, available for 11 patients, ranged from 19 to 196 months (median 36 mo). Seven patients developed local recurrences (multiple in 3), and 3 developed lung metastases. Thus far, 5 patients have died of disease, 3 are alive with recurrent or metastatic disease, and 3 are alive with no evidence of disease. We conclude that dedifferentiated LPS can show lipoblastic differentiation in the high-grade component, resulting in areas indistinguishable from pleomorphic LPS. The available clinical and molecular data support the notion of \"homologous\" lipoblastic differentiation in dedifferentiated LPS, rather than mixed-type LPS.",

We investigated alterations of different genes in the 13q14 region and the amplification status of the MDM2 and CDK4 genes at 12q14-15 by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. In the atypical spindle cell lipomas, MLPA revealed deletions in the two nearest flanking genes of RB1 (ITM2B and RCBTB2) and in multiple important exons of RB1. In contrast, in classical spindle cell lipomas, a less complex loss of RB1 exons was found but no deletion of ITM2B and RCBTB2. Moreover, MLPA identified a deletion of the DLEU1 gene, a finding which has not been reported earlier. We propose an immunohistochemical panel for lipomatous tumors which comprises of MDM2, CDK4, p16, Rb, which we have found useful in discriminating between atypical or classical spindle cell lipomas and other adipocytic neoplasms, especially atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma.

Cytogenetically, WDLS is characterized by the presence of ring or giant rod chromosomes containing several amplified genes, including MDM2, TSPAN31, CDK4, and others mainly derived from chromosome bands 12q13-15. However, the 12q13-15 amplicon is large and discontinuous. The focus of this study was to identify novel critical genes that are consistently amplified in primary (nonrecurrent) WDLS and with potential relevance for future targeted therapy. Using a high-resolution (5.0 kb) \"single nucleotide polymorphism\"/copy number variation microarray to screen the whole genome in a series of primary WDLS, two consistently amplified areas were found on chromosome 12: one region containing the MDM2 and CPM genes, and another region containing the FRS2 gene. Based on these findings, we further validated FRS2 amplification in both WDLS and DDLS. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed FRS2 amplification in all WDLS and DDLS tested (n = 57). Real time PCR showed FRS2 mRNA transcriptional upregulation in WDLS (n = 19) and DDLS (n = 13) but not in lipoma (n = 5) and normal fat (n = 9). Immunoblotting revealed high expression levels of phospho-FRS2 at Y436 and slightly overexpression of total FRS2 protein in liposarcoma but not in normal fat or preadipocytes. Considering the critical role of FRS2 in mediating fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling, our findings indicate that FRS2 signaling should be further investigated as a potential therapeutic target for liposarcoma.",

Recently, small-molecule antagonists of MDM2, the Nutlins, have been developed to inhibit the p53-MDM2 interaction and activate p53 signaling. However, half of human cancers have mutated p53 and they are resistant to Nutlin treatment. Here, we report that treatment of the p53-mutant malignant peripheral nerve sheath (MPNST) and p53-null HCT116 cells with cisplatin (Cis) and Nutlin-3a induced a degree of apoptosis that was significantly greater than either drug alone. Nutlin-3a also increased the cytotoxicity of both carboplatin and doxorubicin in a series of p53-mutant human tumor cell lines. In the human dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell line (LS141) and the p53 wild-type HCT116 cells, Nutlin-3a induced downregulation of E2F1 and this effect appeared to be proteasome dependent. In contrast, in MPNST and HCTp53-/- cells, Nutlin-3a inhibited the binding of E2F1 to MDM2 and induced transcriptional activation of free E2F1 in the presence of Cis-induced DNA damage. Downregulation of E2F1 by small interfering RNA significantly decreased the level of apoptosis induced by Cis and Nutlin-3a treatment. Moreover, expression of a dominant-negative form of E2F1 rescued cells from apoptosis, whereas cells overexpressing wild-type E2F1 showed an increase in cell death. This correlated with the induction of the proapoptotic proteins p73alpha and Noxa, which are both regulated by E2F1. These results indicate that antagonism of MDM2 by Nutlin-3a in cells with mutant p53 enhances chemosensitivity in an E2F1-dependent manner. Nutlin-3a therefore may provide a therapeutic benefit in tumors with mutant p53 provided it is combined with chemotherapy.",

In this series, there were 36 men and 21 women aged from 22 to 87 years (median: 59). Tumors were mainly located in the lower limbs (27 cases), trunk wall (15 cases), and upper limbs (10 cases). Most tumors were deeply located (51/54) with a size from 1 to 30 cm (median: 8 cm). Cases were classified in 3 histologic categories: spindle cell RMS (25 cases), pleomorphic RMS (16 cases), and mixed type (16 cases). Forty-one tumors were grade 3 and 16 grade 2. Immunohistochemistry showed that every case was positive for desmin and myogenin. Alpha smooth muscle actin was positive in 21%, pankeratin AE1/AE3 in 20%, and CD34 in 13.2%.

Atypical lipomatous tumors (ALTs) display supernumerary ring or giant marker chromosomes with amplification of several genes including HMGA2 and MDM2. A study of HMGA2 expression in a variety of adipocytic tumors showed aberrant expression in lipomas with 12q13-15 aberrations and ring chromosomes as well as in ALTs and well-differentiated liposarcomas (WDLSs), and frequent differential expression of HMGA2 exons 1-2 versus that of exons 4-5. A minor subset of adipocytic tumors harbors unbalanced karyotypes with extra copies of 12q sequences in structures that are not giant marker or ring chromosomes. Out of a series of ten such tumors, three lipomas and four ALTs with more than two copies of 12q13-15 and breakpoints in 12q13-15 could be analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to find out whether HMGA2 and MDM2 expression was more similar to the levels seen in lipomas with cytogenetically balanced aberrations of 12q13-15, or to ALTs with giant ring or marker chromosomes. One of two ALTs with more complex, hyperdiploid karyotypes had expression levels closer to those seen in ALT, whereas the remaining six cases were similar to lipomas with 12q13-15 changes and ring chromosomes. Differential expression was seen in two ALTs and all three lipomas. Two cases showed MDM2 expression levels similar to those found among WDLSs, two cases showed levels similar to those found among lipomas, whereas the remaining three cases displayed intermediate expression levels. The studied cases represent intermediates between lipoma and ALT, insofar as they shared 12q13-15 rearrangements and karyotypic stability with lipomas and gain of 12q sequences with ALTs. Neither of these characteristics can be used to discriminate between lipoma and ALT.",

In addition, a number of genes were found differentially expressed in dedifferentiated and pleomorphic liposarcomas. Application of dedicated clustering algorithms revealed that both tumor subtypes are clearly separated by the genomic profiles but only with a lesser power by the expression profiles. Using a support vector machine, a subset of five clones was identified as \"class discriminators.\" Thus, for the distinction of these types of liposarcomas, genomic profiling appears to be more advantageous than RNA expression analysis.",

Mice that were heterozygous for ARF also developed tumors after a longer latency, whereas their wild-type littermates did not. In heterozygotes, tumor formation was accompanied by loss of the residual ARF allele and/or lack of ARF mRNA expression, implying that ARF can act as a canonical \"two-hit\" tumor suppressor gene. Tumors occurred earlier in life in ARF-null animals that were neonatally irradiated or given dimethylbenzanthrene, and several animals treated with carcinogen simultaneously developed multiple forms of malignancy arising from distinct cell lineages. Although p53-null mice primarily develop lymphomas and fibrosarcomas, the frequency of these two tumor types was inverted in ARF-null animals, with undifferentiated sarcomas predominating in a 3:2 ratio; 28% of ARF-null animals developed carcinomas and tumors of the nervous system, which have been rarely observed in untreated p53-null mice.

We aimed to study the incidence of local recurrence of 90 cases of atypical lipomatous tumours and an additional 18 cases of de novo dedifferentiated liposarcoma. All tumours were diagnosed on the basis of MDM2 amplification: all patients had their first treatment in the same specialist sarcoma unit and were followed for a minimum of 60 months. The tumours were diagnosed between 1997 and 2009 and followed until the end of 2014. Seventy cases (78%) of atypical lipomatous tumours were located in the thigh (mean size 195 mm on presentation). Eight atypical lipomatous tumours (8.9%) recurred locally, of which 50% recurred after 60 months. The only two tumours with intralesional excisions recurred. Seven of the eight recurrent tumours were detected by the patient by self-examination. One case recurred a second time as a dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Seventeen per cent of the de novo dedifferentiated liposarcomas recurred within 60 months of presentation. Extending the study period revealed that atypical lipomatous tumour could recur up to 40 years after the first surgery. Furthermore, of 26 tumours that recurred in the extended study, 27% recurred more than once, and three of the seven that recurred more than once transformed into a dedifferentiated liposarcoma. We recommend that, following post-operative wound care, patients with atypical lipomatous tumour are referred back to their general practitioner for follow up, but that in the event of a suspected recurrence they have rapid access back to the specialist unit using a 'supported discharge' scheme. In the event of an intralesional excision and if a lesion recurs, patients are followed in a specialist unit at regular intervals: whether MRI scanning is a valuable means of monitoring such patients is unclear and requires an evidence base.

We demonstrate that an alteration in the CDKN2A/CDKN2B/CDK4/CCND1 pathway is present in almost all cases without CDK4 amplification, thereby confirming the pivotal role of this pathway in liposarcoma oncogenesis. Moreover, we show that cell cycle and differentiation are driven by a subtle and complex balance between members of this pathway. Finally, we demonstrate that in tumors without amplification/overexpression of CDK4, the chromosome 1q21-1q23 region is a preferential partner of chromosome 12 amplicon, suggesting that the mechanism of amplification is slightly different in this group of tumors.",

Using a combination of different methods, we extensively investigated the structure and composition of rings and giant rods in a series of 17 WDLPS-ALP samples and three intra- or intermuscular lipomas (IMLP), revealing a unique combination of particular features strikingly related to these tumors. Although the rings and rods displayed in vitro and in vivo stability, the presence of alpha-satellites could not be detected on these supernumerary structures. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis, in combination with fluorescence in situ hybridization, identified the chromosomal regions contributing to the formation of these chromosomes: in WDLPS-ALP, all carried amplifications of 12q 14-15 and the MDM2 gene, with variable other noncontiguous regions. In the three IMLP, the rings consistently carried amplifications of 12q15-21 and 1q21, but increased copies of MDM2 were found in only one case. Other genes located more proximal in 12q14-15 were amplified in several WDLPS-ALP, but showed a normal copy number in IMLP. Furthermore, the immunohistochemical expression of the MDM2 protein was detected in most (12/14) WDLPS-ALP, in 1-30% of the cells, but never in IMLP. These supernumerary chromosomes represent a peculiar kind of amplification structure, midway between double minute chromosomes and homogeneously staining regions, but the mechanisms underlying the formation of these structures remain obscure.",

The relapse revealed features of a dedifferentiated liposarcoma with spindle-cell, partly pleomorphic dedifferentiation and osseous metaplasia. Clearly separated from the spindle-cell areas, an extensive homogeneously dense lymphoid (lymphocytic) tumor-component was evident, with relative abrupt transition to the well-differentiated liposarcoma component. Using immunohistochemistry and PCR, the lymphoid (\"lymphoma-like\") infiltrate proved to be a polyclonal lymphocytic proliferation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISII) analysis revealed no signs of MDM2- and CDK4-gene amplification in the lymphoid areas, although within this mononuclear lymphoid population, large polymorphic nuclei displayed an amplified number of MDM2/CDK4 gene copies, indicating the presence of truly dedifferentiated tumor cells within the lymphoid component.

Detailed mapping studies of the amplified region are necessary for definition of the impact of these amplification events on the tumor cell phenotype. By using the genes in this region and genomic fragments isolated by chromosome microdissection, we have established a series of ordered probes from 12q13-15 for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and Southern blot analysis. These probes have been used for physical mapping of two portions of the interval from GLI to D12S8. The centromeric region extends 1.8 Mb from GLI to microclone M79 and contains at least five genes, including the cyclin-dependent kinase gene CDK4. The more telomeric region includes the p53 regulator MDM2 and covers 1.1 Mb. We used the same group of probes to determine the pattern of amplification in three cell lines and three tumor specimens carrying amplified sequences from 12q13-15. In addition, we used a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig of several megabases covering the entire region from SAS to D12S8 for FISH to determine the pattern of amplification in the neuroblastoma cell line NGP-127.

However, the recent report of GNAS mutations being detected in a significant proportion of parosteal osteosarcoma challenges the specificity of this mutation. As the number of cases reported in this study was small we set out to determine if these results could be reproduced. We studied 97 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded low-grade osteosarcomas from 90 patients including 62 parosteal osteosarcomas, of which MDM2 amplification was detected in 79%, 11 periosteal osteosarcomas and 24 low-grade central osteosarcoma samples. The mutational status of GNAS was analyzed in codons p.R201, p.Q227, and other less common GNAS alterations by bidirectional Sanger sequencing and/or next generation sequencing using the Life Technologies Ion Torrent platform. GNAS mutations were not detected in any of the low-grade osteosarcomas from which informative DNA was extracted.

Previous studies have shown that low-level gain of the 12q14-15 region, such as trisomy 12 and 12q15-24 duplication, might be sufficient for the development of minimal atypia and formation of WDLPS. Moreover, because some features, such as overexpression of HMGA2, are shared by both lipomas and WDLPS, it has been hypothesized that lipomas and WDLPS may form a genetic and morphological continuum. We report here the results of molecular cytogenetic analysis of 8 lipomas that had unusual chromosomal features resulting in gains of 12q14-15. While 3 cases had simple numerical rearrangements (trisomy 12) or structural rearrangements (unbalanced translocations with 12q gains), 5 cases were particularly intriguing because of peculiar features such as giant chromosomes, supernumerary chromosomes or neocentromeres that usually are the hallmark of WDLPS. Gain of 12q14-15 sequences including extra copies of MDM2 and CDK4 were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis in all analyzed cases but no expression of MDM2 and CDK4 was observed suggesting that these genomic imbalances had no functional consequence. We observed rearrangements of HMGA2 in 5 out 8 cases. Altogether, our results indicate that moderate gains of 12q are not always associated with a malignant phenotype, and that some intermediary forms exist between classical lipomas and classical WDLPS. Some of these intermediary forms may correspond to a genomic premalignant condition while some may have no malignant potential.",

In this study, we reported the histologic features of a series of 30 LB with emphasis on the potential diagnostic pitfalls and investigated the immunohistochemical expression of p16. Moreover, p16 immunostaining was performed in 16 liposarcomas (11 WDL and 5 ML), 16 lipomas, and 16 cases of liponecrosis in order to evaluate its usefulness in the differential diagnosis of challenging lesions occurring in older children. Overall, p16 immunostaining was positive in 3 LBs and in 12 out of 16 liposarcomas (10 WDL and 2 ML), with a sensitivity of 75%, a specificity of 90%, a positive predictive value of 80%, and a negative predictive value of 87%. All lipomas were p16 negative, whereas 5 liponecroses were positive. Accounting altogether the benign lesions versus liposarcomas, p16 showed a sensitivity of 75%, a specificity of 87%, a positive predictive value of 60%, and a negative predictive value of 93%. Our data suggest that a negative p16 immunostaining may be helpful in excluding a liposarcoma when occurring in unusual clinical contexts, such as in adolescence or late recurrence. However, such finding should be interpreted with caution since also some liposarcomas lack p16 and occasional LBs are positive. ",

We present the rare case of an atypical lipomatous tumor (synonym: well-differentiated lipoma-like liposarcoma) in a 14-year-old girl with the differential diagnosis of lipoblastoma which was excluded by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The tumor presented as a soft tissue mass at the dorsal part of the right thigh measuring up to 18 cm. Microscopically the lesion consisted of atypical adipocytes with hyperchromatic nuclei and additional multivacuolated lipoblasts. Interphase dual-color FISH performed with chromosome 8 centromeric and YAC164H5 (mapping to exons 2-5 of the PLAG1 gene) probes revealed no rearrangement of PLAG1 oncogene or polysomy of chromosome 8. Additional FISH using an MDM2 gene probe and an BAC534N15 probe (containing sequences specific for the CDK4 gene) showed amplification of the CDK4 gene. These findings indicate that this tumor was no lipoblastoma but an atypical lipomatous tumor, which is of clinical relevance. In young individuals the distinction between lipoblastoma and liposarcoma is often impossible by light microscopy alone. This case shows that FISH can serve as a decisive tool in the differential diagnosis of lipoblastoma and lipoma-like liposarcoma apart from its role in distinction between lipoblastoma and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma.",

Overexpression of MTBP in human osteosarcoma cell lines lacking wild-type p53 did not alter primary tumor growth in mice, but significantly inhibited metastases. MTBP downregulation increased the migratory potential of MDM2(-/-)p53(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that MTBP inhibited cell migration independently of the Mdm2-p53 pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis identified alpha-actinin-4 (ACTN4) as an MTBP-interacting protein. Endogenous MTBP interacted with and partially colocalized with ACTN4. MTBP overexpression inhibited cell migration and filopodia formation mediated by ACTN4. Increased cell migration by MTBP downregulation was inhibited by concomitant downregulation of ACTN4. MTBP also inhibited ACTN4-mediated F-actin bundling. We furthermore demonstrated that nuclear localization of MTBP was dispensable for inhibiting ACTN4-mediated cell migration and filopodia formation. Thus, MTBP suppresses cell migration, at least partially, by inhibiting ACTN4 function. Our study not only provides a mechanism of metastasis suppression by MTBP, but also suggests MTBP as a potential biomarker for cancer progression.",

In addition to histological studies, we evaluated the expression of nm23, c-MET, p53, and MDM2 immunohistochemically using 25 osteosarcomas in which both primary and concordant metastatic specimens were available. Moreover, we assessed proliferative activity using the monoclonal antibody MIB-1. Among these 25 cases, 4 tumors that were osteoblastic type (16%) in the primary site had changed morphologically to MFH-like type in the metastatic site, whereas 2 MFH-like type and 1 small cell-type tumors had changed to osteoblastic type. MIB-1 LI was significantly higher in the metastatic site than in the primary site (primary, 20.02; metastatic, 26.72; P = .0209). Seventeen cases (68%) showed increased nm23 expression in the metastatic site, whereas 2 cases showed reduced expression. nm23 expression was significantly increased in the metastatic site, compared with the primary site (P = .0009). Seven cases (28%) showing negative reaction for c-MET in the primary site showed immunuoreactivity for c-MET in the metastatic site. Although there was no statistical significance, c-MET expression seemed to be more frequent in the metastatic site, compared with the primary site. Among the overall tumors, c-MET-positive tumors showed significantly higher MIB-1 LI, compared with c-MET-negative tumors (negative, 20.99; positive, 27.65; P = .0292). No significant change was observed regarding p53 and MDM2 between the primary and metastatic site. Our results suggest that rather than being a metastasis-suppressor gene, nm23 is in fact correlated with metastatic progression in osteosarcoma.

All consecutive patients affected by primary well-differentiated (WD)/dedifferentiated (DD) retroperitoneal liposarcoma, surgically treated at our institution between January 2002 and December 2011, were retrospectively evaluated. Tumors were stained for mdm2 and 5 myogenic markers (smooth muscle actin-α, h-caldesmon, calponin, desmin, myogenin). The French National Federation of the Centers for the Fight Against Cancer (FNCLCC) grading system was applied. Overall survival, crude cumulative incidence of local recurrence, and distant metastases were calculated. Multivariable analyses were carried out. A total of 144 patients were identified. Median follow-up was 68 months (interquartile range: 46 to 104 mo). Fifty-two patients were affected by WD/G1 and 92 by DD liposarcoma. Among the latter, 60 were grade G2 and 32 G3. Myogenic differentiation was present in 54 cases (8/52 WD/G1, 27/60 DD/G2, 18/32 DD/G3). Seven cases had a rhabdomyoblastic DD component (1/60 DD/G2 and 6/32 DD/G3). Five-year overall survival rates were 93%, 57%, and 21% for WD/G1 liposarcoma, G2 DD, and G3 DD liposarcoma, respectively, and 75%, 42%, and 29% for liposarcoma without myogenic differentiation, with myogenic differentiation, with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation, respectively (P<0.001). Of note, 5/6 patients affected by G3 DD liposarcoma with a rhabdomyoblastic component died within 8 months.

However, its anticancer effects and mechanisms against osteosarcoma have not been explored. To determine the anticancer effect of PL on osteosarcoma cell lines MG-63 and U2OS, cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were measured, and Western blot analyses were performed. PL significantly inhibited the growth of osteosarcoma cells, particularly U2OS cells. PL up-regulated the expression of p53 in U2OS cells and p21 in the two osteosarcoma cell lines causing cell cycle arrest by decreasing the expression of murine double minute 2 (MDM2)/cyclin B1 and cyclin D1. Furthermore, PL altered the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, and may have triggered the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, resulting in caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation. We also found that PL induced the generation of ROS in osteosarcoma cell lines. To conclude, PL exerted anticancer activity on osteosarcoma cells by inducing pro-apoptotic signaling and modulating the intracellular ROS that causes induction of apoptosis.

Mutational events, as well as adaptive mechanisms, contribute to the development of drug resistance. In this context we uncover here the role of a miRNA, miR-579-3p. We first show that low expression of miR-579-3p is a negative prognostic factor correlating with poor survival. Expression levels of miR-579-3p decrease from nevi to stage III/IV melanoma samples and even further in cell lines resistant to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that miR-579-3p acts as an oncosuppressor by targeting the 3'UTR of two oncoproteins: BRAF and an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, MDM2. Moreover miR-579-3p ectopic expression impairs the establishment of drug resistance in human melanoma cells. Finally, miR-579-3p is strongly down-regulated in matched tumor samples from patients before and after the development of resistance to targeted therapies. ",

IM exhibits strong antiproliferative effects but fails to induce sufficient levels of apoptosis resulting in low pathologic complete remission rates and a high rate of secondary progression in the metastatic setting. Upregulation of p53 by MDM2 inhibitors has been shown to induce apoptosis in p53 wildtype tumors. Analyzing a series of 62 mostly untreated, localized and metastatic GIST we detected a low rate (3%) of inactivating p53 mutations, thus providing a rationale for further exploration of p53-directed therapeutic strategies. To this end, we studied nutlin-3, an inhibitor of the p53 antagonist MDM2, and RITA, a putative p53 activator, in GIST cell lines. Nutlin-3 effectively induced p53 at therapeutically relevant levels, which resulted in moderate antiproliferative effects and cell cycle arrest in p53 wildtype GIST cell lines GIST430, GIST48 and GIST48B. P53 reactivation substantially improved the apoptotic response after effective KIT inhibition with sunitinib and 17-AAG in IM-resistant cell lines. The commonly used imatinib-sensitive cell lines GIST882 and GIST-T1 were shown to harbor defective p53 and therefore failed to respond to nutlin-3 treatment. RITA induced p53 in GIST48B, followed by antiproliferative effects and a strong induction of apoptosis. Surprisingly, GIST-T1 was also highly sensitive to RITA despite lacking functional p53. This suggested a more complex, p53-independent mechanism of action for the latter compound. No antagonistic effects from p53-activating drugs were seen with any drug combination. Our data provide first evidence that modulation of the MDM2/p53 pathway may be therapeutically useful to improve the apoptotic response of KIT-inhibitory drugs in the treatment of naïve GIST, with p53 mutation status being a predictive factor of response.",

The gene expression profile of GSE16568, including 3 CCOC samples with miR-22 overexpression and 3 negative controls, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using the limma package in R. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed by using The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Furthermore, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database. Besides, the miR-22-mRNA interaction pairs were predicted to explore the critical genes involved in the cancer. Totally, 95 up-regulated DEGs and 51 down-regulated DEGs were identified. The DEGs were enriched in different GO terms and pathways. The up-regulated genes cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK6), MDM2 oncogene, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (MDM2), and thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) were involved in the p53 signaling pathway. The up-regulated gene FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS) was a hub protein in the PPI network of the DEGs. The down-regulated DEGs including lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) and v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) were mainly associated with immunity. Nine DEGs as target genes were identified to be recognized by miR-22. Our study suggested that several key genes such as CDK6, MDM2, LEF1, MYB, and FOS that involved in different pathways including p53 signaling pathway were associated with CCOC progression. miR-22 may play an essential role in cell migration and invasion in CCOC through targeting responsive genes.",

Although the ability of Nutlins to suppress the growth of wildtype p53 tumors has been clearly established, their biological activity in normal cells and tissues has not been extensively studied.;Peripheral blood mononuclear cell pre-osteoclasts were cultured with macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) + RANKL or co-cultured with SaOS-2 osteosarcoma cells in the presence of IL-1beta to induce osteoclastic differentiation. Cell cycle was analyzed by BrdU incorporation. The degree of osteoclastic differentiation was monitored at different culture times by TRACP and DAPI staining, as well as by TRACP-5b ELISA. Finally, the role of p53 in mediating the biological activity of Nutlin-3 was studied using specific siRNA.;Exposure of human pre-osteoclasts to RANKL induced an early (24 h) increase in the percentage of cells in the S phase, followed by the exit from the cell cycle at later time-points. The simultaneous addition of Nutlin-3 and RANKL dose-dependently decreased the percentage of pre-osteoclasts in the S phase and induced a rapid accumulation of p53 protein coupled with the induction of p53 target genes. Unexpectedly, the administration of Nutlin-3 to pre-osteoclasts at early culture times significantly suppressed the final output of osteoclasts at day 14 of culture. The role of p53 in mediating this biological activity of Nutlin-3 was underscored by gene knockdown experiments, in which the anti-osteoclastic activity of Nutlin-3 was significantly counteracted by siRNA specific for p53. Nutlin-3 also significantly decreased the formation of osteoclasts in a co-culture system of SaOS-2 osteosarcoma and pre-osteoclastic cells.;These findings indicate that Nutlin-3 abrogates both pre-osteoclastic proliferation and differentiation through a p53-dependent pathway and may have therapeutic implications for those neoplastic diseases characterized by an abnormal osteoclastic activity.",

In a former study (3) we were able to show, that immuno-histochemical p53-accumulation in chondromatous neoplasias might be an additional hint for malignancy. Now we tried to find out, whether p53-accumulation is caused by TP53-aberrations or functional inactivation of p53-wildtype protein by MDM2. For this purpose, paraffin-embedded material of 80 chondromatous neoplasms (18 chondromas, 18 chondromatous neoplasms of uncertain dignity (i.e. cytologically suspicious but without definite invasive growth), and 44 chondrosarcomas (24 GI, 13 GII, 7 GIII)) were screened for TP53 gene-aberrations by means of DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; exons 5-8). The results were correlated with immunohistochemical p53-accumulation (DO-7, DAKO) and MDM2-expression (AB-1, Oncogene). A total of 43% of all chondromatous neoplasms showed TP53-aberrations in DGGE-analysis, i.e. 27% of chondromas, 50% of chondromatous neoplasms of uncertain dignity, 46% of GI-, 46% of GII- and 71% of GIII-chondrosarcomas. Exon 6 (58% of all cases with aberrations) and exon 8 (47%) were affected most frequently. No significant correlation between TP53-aberration and either p53-accumulation or MDM2-expression was present. A statistically significant correlation could be found between p53-accumulation and MDM2-expression (p < 0.0001). Regarding histological tumor-classification, p53-accumulation and MDM2-expression discriminated between chondromas/chondromatous neoplasms of uncertain dignity and well differentiated chondrosarcomas in a statistically significant manner. In the subgroup of p53-positive and MDM2-negative cases significantly more TP53-aberrations were detected by DGGE-analysis than in the other groups. Interestingly, the subgroup of p53- and MDM2-negative cases showed the second highest rate of TP53-DGGE-aberrations. Nearly 50% of these aberrations, however, were localized in exon 8, a mutation that is known to cause no p53-protein-accumulation. In conclusion, TP53-aberrations occur frequently in chondromatous neoplasms and show no significant association to either immunohistochemical p53-accumulation or MDM2-expression. Functional inactivation of p53 wildtype protein by MDM2-expression seems to be the major cause of p53-accumulation in chondromatous neoplasms and emphasizes the role of these parameters as additional hint for malignancy.",

Here, we report that nutlin-3a induces cellular senescence in murine primary fibroblasts, oncogenically transformed fibroblasts, and fibrosarcoma cell lines. No evidence of drug-induced apoptosis was observed in any case. Nutlin-induced senescence was strictly dependent on the presence of functional p53 as revealed by the fact that cells lacking p53 were completely insensitive to the drug, whereas cells lacking the tumor suppressor alternative reading frame product of the CDKN2A locus underwent irreversible cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, irreversibility was achieved in neoplastic cells faster than in their corresponding parental primary cells, suggesting that nutlin-3a and oncogenic signaling cooperate in activating p53.

To examine INK4A gene alterations in uncultured samples of osteosarcoma and the relationship between INK4A and CDK4 alterations, we analyzed the INK4A and CDK4 genes in 87 specimens from 79 patients. INK4A deletion and CDK4 gene amplification were determined by quantitative Southern blot analysis. INK4A exon 2 was screened for mutation by polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis. Methylation at the CpG island in INK4A, associated with loss of p16INK4A expression, was assessed by Southern blot analysis using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. INK4A deletion (4/55) or rearrangement (1/55) was found in 5 of 55 cases. No INK4A exon 2 point mutations and methylation were detected. CDK4 gene amplification was found in 6 of 67 samples, but not in tumors with INK4A alteration. Amplification analysis of other genes at 12q13 (GLI, CHOP, HMGI-C and MDM2) in these 6 cases supports the view that CDK4 and MDM2 are independent targets for amplification, with variable amplification of the intervening region containing HMGI-C. Of 46 patients studied for both INK4A alterations and CDK4 amplification, the tumors in 22% contained one or the other. The prevalence of these alterations, in conjunction with the reported inactivation of RB in up to 80% of cases, suggests that genetic lesions deregulating the G1 to S cell cycle checkpoint may be an almost constant feature in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma.",

Currently, sarcomas with multilineage differentiation fulfilling the criteria of MM tend to be diagnosed as specific sarcomas with heterologous differentiation (e.g., de-differentiated liposarcoma) rather than MM; however, some cases of these tumors are difficult to classify. The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical features of these unclassifiable tumors, the so-called MM, and to determine whether some parameters are a useful adjunct for the classification of these tumors from the viewpoint of clinical outcome. Twelve cases of so-called MM were investigated retrospectively. The patients (six male, six female) ranged in age from 6 to 71 years (mean 48 years). Tumor size ranged from 3 to 20 cm (mean 13 cm). Tumor locations included the retroperitoneum (five cases), abdominal wall (two), thigh (two), forearm (one), lung (one), and parotid gland (one). The differentiated mesenchymal components were rhabdomyosarcomatous (RMS) (six cases), liposarcomatous (five), chondrosarcomatous (five), osteosarcomatous (five), or leiomyosarcomatous (four). Follow-up in all cases (range 4-129 months; mean 36 months) showed a 67% local recurrence rate, a 33% metastatic rate, and a 50% disease-related mortality. The patients who were under 40 years of age or who had an RMS component showed significantly worse survival than did patients in the other groups. The other mesenchymal components showed no significant correlation with survival. The immunophenotypes of p53 and mdm2 were almost identical between the two mesenchymal components in each case; however, there was no significant correlation between either of these immunophenotypes and the clinical outcome. None of the other factors (gender, tumor site, tumor size, or MIB-1-labeling index) was found to be a statistically significant prognostic indicator. In conclusion, a patient age under 40 years and the presence of an RMS component appear to be poor prognostic indicators of survival in patients with so-called MM, and to be a useful adjunct for the classification of these tumors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"A recurrent intrachromosomal rearrangement on chromosome 12q in solitary fibrous tumor leads to the formation of a NAB2-STAT6 fusion oncogene. As a result, nuclear expression of the cytoplasmic transcription factor STAT6 is found in solitary fibrous tumor and serves as a useful diagnostic marker. STAT6 is located in 12q13, a region containing well-characterized oncogenes that are commonly amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma; we have previously reported that STAT6 is expressed in a subset of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of STAT6 expression in dedifferentiated liposarcoma and the underlying genetic mechanism. STAT6 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a well-characterized series of 35 previously unpublished cases of dedifferentiated liposarcoma, all with nuclear MDM2 and/or CDK4 expression by immunohistochemistry and/or cytogenetic features of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. FISH for STAT6 was performed in all cases with STAT6 expression, and a subset of control cases without STAT6 expression. In total 4/35 cases (11%) showed STAT6 expression (three with multifocal staining of moderate to strong intensity and one with weak focal staining). FISH demonstrated amplification of STAT6 in all cases positive for STAT6 by immunohistochemistry; in contrast, FISH performed on four STAT6-negative dedifferentiated liposarcomas demonstrated no STAT6 amplification (P=0.0286). Of the four STAT6 amplified cases, three patients were male and one was female, ranging in age from 51 to 76 years. Tumors were located in the mediastinum (n=2), paratesticular soft tissue (n=1), and perirenal soft tissue (n=1). Three patients received pre-operative chemotherapy +/- radiation therapy. In conclusion, STAT6 is amplified in a subset of dedifferentiated liposarcoma, resulting in STAT6 protein expression that can be detected by immunohistochemistry and may be a potential pitfall in the differential diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma and solitary fibrous tumor. These findings suggest a role for STAT6-mediated transcriptional activity in some cases of dedifferentiated liposarcoma and highlight the genomic complexity and heterogeneity of dedifferentiated liposarcoma.

These amplicons are either localized, in well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS), on extrachromosomal structures (ring or rod chromosomes), or integrated into chromosome arms in undifferentiated tumors. Our results reveal that extrachromosomal amplicons are unstable, and frequently lost by micronucleation. This loss correlates with hypermethylation of eliminated sequences and changes of their replication time. Treatment of cells with demethylating agents during early S-phase significantly decreases the rate of micronuclei positive for CDK4. We also demonstrate that, in our model, micronuclei are generated during anaphase as a consequence of anaphase abnormalities (chromosome lagging and anaphase bridges). Finally, a dramatic increase of adipocytic differentiation was noted in cells that have eliminated copies of CDK4 gene in micronuclei. These findings provide evidence that, in WDLPS, adipocytic differentiation could be the consequence of CDK4 loss, an event occurring rarely in undifferentiated tumors in which the amplified sequences are integrated into chromosome arms.",

Herein, we describe a large retroperitoneal lipoma with classic histopathologic, cytogenetic, molecular cytogenetic, and molecular genetic features. Extensive morphologic inspection showed no evidence of cytologic atypia. Cytogenetic analysis performed on fresh tissue material revealed the classic lipoma chromosome t(3;12)(q27;q14-15). Fluorescence in situ hybridization on multiple sections excluded the presence of MDM2 and CDK4 amplification, but showed HMGA2 balanced rearrangement in most cells. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing analysis confirmed the presence of the HMGA2-LPP fusion gene, a characteristic and the most common fusion product found in lipoma. The patient has been followed for 2.5 years without evidence of recurrence or metastasis.

Here, we report a case that had scattered hyperchromatic cells and lipoblasts within the adipose tissue component. In other anatomic sites similar appearing lesions have been interpreted as pedunculated liposarcomas/atypical lipomatous tumors that are more prone to local recurrences than classic giant fibrovascular polyps. Reports of dedifferentiation and metastases are lacking thus raising the possibility that the cytologic findings in such lesions are degenerative. To confirm our suspicion of liposarcomatous differentiation, we performed immunohistochemistry for MDM2 and p53, 2 markers that are known to be negative in benign lipomatous lesions and positive in well-differentiated liposarcomas/atypical lipomatous tumors.

For this purpose, 21 cases of the former and 19 cases of the latter tumours were analysed by ICC and, according to the availability of material, by molecular and cytogenetic approaches. All lipomas displayed a null MDM2/CDK4 phenotype, whereas all LL-WDL showed MDM2/CDK4 or CDK4 phenotypes. Southern blot analysis performed on 16 suitable cases, complemented by fluorescence in situ hybridization and classical cytogenetic analysis in 11 cases, was consistent with, and further supported the immunophenotyping data.

We studied the frequency of amplification of these genes in a series of 48 dedifferentiated liposarcomas and 68 atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas. We correlated their amplification status with clinicopathological features and outcomes. Histologically, both CDK4 (P=0.007) and JUN (P=0.005) amplifications were associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma, whereas amplification of the proximal parts of HMGA2 (5'-untranslated region (UTR) and exons 1-3) was associated with atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (P=0.01). CDK4 amplification was associated with axial tumors. Amplification of 5'-UTR and exons 1-3 of HMGA2 was associated with primary status and grade 1. Shorter overall survival was correlated with: age >64 years (P=0.03), chemotherapy used in first intent (P<0.001), no surgery (P=0.003), grade 3 (P<0.001), distant metastasis (P<0.001), node involvement (P=0.006), and CDK4 amplification (P=0.07). In multivariate analysis, distant metastasis (HR=8.8) and grade 3 (HR=18.2) were associated with shorter overall survival. A shorter recurrence-free survival was associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (P<0.001), grade 3 (P<0.001), node involvement (P<0.001), distant metastasis (P=0.02), recurrent status (P=0.009), axial location (P=0.001), and with molecular features such as CDK4 (P=0.05) and JUN amplification (P=0.07). Amplification of 5'-UTR and exons 1-3 (P=0.08) and 3'-UTR (P=0.01) of HMGA2 were associated with longer recurrence-free survival. Distant metastasis was associated with shorter recurrence-free survival (HR=5.8) in multivariate analysis. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma type was associated with axial location, grade 3 and recurrent status. In conclusion, we showed that the amplification of HMGA2 was associated with the atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma histological type and a good prognosis, whereas CDK4 and JUN amplifications were associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma histology and a bad prognosis.

Interestingly, the amplification profiles of these six genes were found to be significantly different between WDLPS and DDLPS, more frequently having a high-level status in DDLPS than in WDLPS.

First, we evaluated MDM2-CDK4 amplification and expression in a series of 94 well-defined adipose tissue tumors. Results showed that FISH was interpretable in 45 of 50 cases (90%), and was more specific and sensitive than Q-PCR and IHC. We then used the same techniques as complementary diagnostic tools in a series of 106 adipose and soft tissue tumors of unclear diagnosis to distinguish between (i) lipomas and atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcomas, (ii) malignant undifferentiated tumors and dedifferentiated liposarcomas, and (iii) a variety of benign tumors and liposarcomas. Our results indicate that although helpful, IHC alone is often insufficient to solve diagnostic problems. FISH and Q-PCR methods gave concordant results and were equally informative in most cases. However, the proportion of noninterpretable cases was slightly higher with FISH than with Q-PCR. When tumor cells represented a minor component of the tumor tissue, such as with inflammatory tumors, FISH was more powerful than Q-PCR by allowing visualization of individual cells. In conclusion, we recommend that the evaluation of MDM2-CDK4 amplification using FISH or Q-PCR be used to supplement IHC analysis when diagnosis of adipose tissue tumors is not possible based on clinical and histologic information alone.",

Some well-known examples are the differential diagnosis between aneurysmal bone cyst and telangiectatic osteosarcoma and giant cell tumor versus giant cell-containing highly malignant osteosarcoma. As a new approach to these diagnostic problems, we analyzed the genetic instability in a larger number of bone-forming tumor-like lesions, benign and malignant osteoblastic tumors. Analysis focused on genetic alterations in cell cycle regulator genes: Mutations in the p53 gene and ras gene, loss of heterozygosity at the p53, p16 and Rb-locus, and amplification of the mdm2 gene and the c-myc-gene. In addition to cell cycle regulators, the telomerase activity has also been analyzed. The results show that the number of genetic alterations increases with the malignancy of the tumors. The highest number of genetic alterations could thus be found in conventional intraosseous osteosarcoma. In tumor-like lesions, genetic alterations have rarely been observed. The results of this study show that the analysis of genetic instability will probably contribute to an improved differential diagnosis of osteoblastic tumors.",

But the mechanism of IFNalpha in regulating chemosensitivity has not been fully understood. To study whether IFNalpha affected chemosensitivity of osteosarcoma cells, we treated p53-wild U2OS cells and p53-mutant MG63 cells with IFNalpha and etoposide, alone or in combination, and then examined growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. IFNalpha enhanced etoposide-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in p53-wild U2OS cells but not p53-mutant MG63 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Etoposide-induced G2/M phase arrest was also enhanced by IFNalpha. The enhanced apoptosis was associated with the accumulation of transcriptionally active p53 accompanied with increased Bax and Mdm2, as well as decreased Bcl-2. IFNalpha also activated caspases-3, -8 and -9 protein kinases and PARP cleavage in response to etoposide in U2OS cells. Moreover, the combination-induced cytotoxicity and PARP cleavage were significantly reduced by caspase pan inhibitor and p53 siRNA. Thus we conclude that IFNalpha enhances etoposide-induced apoptosis in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells by a p53-dependent and caspase-activation pathway. The proper combination of IFNalpha and conventional chemotherapeutic agents may be a rational strategy for the treatment of human osteosarcoma with functional p53.",

While WDLPS is cytogenetically characterized by the presence of supernumerary ring or giant chromosomes containing MDM2 amplification, data concerning the genomic alterations of SCL are scarce. Here, we describe the molecular cytogenetic characterization of two SCL cases. In these two cases, we did not identify supernumerary ring or giant chromosomes containing 12q amplification or any other chromosome 12 rearrangement. Instead, we observed a partial or complete monosomy 7 as the sole anomaly or among a few additional simple numeric and structural abnormalities. Monosomy 7 is not usual in adipose tissue tumors. It has been described in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemias, as well as in several benign or malignant solid tumors. Our data suggest that the loss of material from chromosome 7 might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of some SCL probably through the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes located on chromosome 7. On the basis of cytogenetic and molecular findings, some SCL may constitute an independent entity rather than being regarded as variants of WDLPS.",

Our goal is to bridge this experimental gap by establishing and characterizing an in vitro/in vivo model useful for examining WDLPS/DDLPS molecular pathogenesis and also therapeutic screening and testing. WDLPS/DDLPS cells were isolated from freshly resected human surgical specimens and were phenotypically and molecularly characterized. MDM2 amplification was determined via FISH analysis. Adipogenic differentiation was evaluated using Oil Red O staining and western blotting (WB). Tyrosine kinase receptors' (TKRs) expression in pre-adipocytes, adipocytes, WDLPS, and DDLPS cells was determined via western blot analysis. SCID mouse xenograft growth was assessed after subcutaneous and/or intraperitoneal tumor cell injection. There was enhanced proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, and pro-angiogenic capacity in DDLPS cells vs WDLPS cells. DDLPS cells formed tumors in SCID mice whereas WDLPS did not. WDLPS/DDLPS cells, especially those that exhibited baseline PPARγ expression, partially retained terminal adipogenic differentiation capacity. MDM2 amplification was found in all WDLPS/DDLPS cell strains, CDK4 overexpression was observed in LPS cells as compared with normal adipocytes, and enhanced JUN expression and phosphorylation was seen in DDLPS cells as compared with WDLPS cells. The TKRs: MET, AXL, KIT, and IGF-1R were overexpressed in LPS cells vs normal adipocytes and pre-adipocytes. In conclusion, these newly established cellular and xenograft models can facilitate investigation of liposarcomagenesis, dedifferentiation, and tumor progression. Further studies of the molecular deregulations so identified may lead to improved therapeutic strategies for patients afflicted by these unfavorable malignancies.",

Here, we performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to detect chromosomal copy number changes in a series of 16 rat osteosarcomas induced by injection of plutonium-238. Recurrent gains/amplifications were observed at chromosomal regions 3p12-q12, 3q41-qter, 4q41-qter, 6q12-q16, 7q22-q34, 8q11-q23, 9q11-q22, 10q32.1-qter, and 12q, whereas recurrent losses were observed at 1p, 1q, 3q23-q35, 5q21-q33, 8q24-q31, 10q22-q25, 15p, 15q, and 18q.

The lost regions at 5q21-q33, 10q22-q25 and 15q contained tumor suppressor genes such as p16INK4a/p19ARF, Tp53 and Rb1. To identify potential target gene(s) for the chromosomal aberrations, we compared the expression levels of several candidate genes, located within the regions of frequent chromosomal aberrations, between the tumors and normal osteoblasts by using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The Cdk4, c-Myc, Pdgf-b and p57KIP2 genes were thought to be possible target genes for the frequent chromosomal gain at 7q22-34 and loss at 1q in the tumors, respectively. In addition, mutations of the Tp53 gene were found in 27% (4 of 15) osteosarcomas.

The clinical outcome for osteosarcoma remains discouraging despite aggressive surgery and intensive radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimens. Thus, novel therapeutic approaches are needed. Previously, we have shown that inorganic phosphate (Pi) inhibits proliferation and aggressiveness of human osteosarcoma U2OS cells identifying adenylate cyclase, beta3 integrin, Rap1, ERK1/2 as proteins whose expression and function are relevantly affected in response to Pi. In this study, we investigated whether Pi could affect chemosensitivity of osteosarcoma cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we report that Pi inhibits proliferation of p53-wild type U2OS cells (and not of p53-null Saos and p53-mutant MG63 cells) by slowing-down cell cycle progression, without apoptosis occurrence. Interestingly, we found that Pi strongly enhances doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity in U2OS, and not in Saos and MG63 cells, by apoptosis induction, as revealed by a marked increase of sub-G1 population, Bcl-2 downregulation, caspase-3 activation, and PARP cleavage. Remarkably, Pi/doxorubicin combination-induced cytotoxicity was accompanied by an increase of p53 protein levels and of p53 target genes mdm2, p21 and Bax, and was significantly reduced by the p53 inhibitor pifithrine-alpha. Moreover, the doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity was associated with ERK1/2 pathway inhibition in response to Pi. Altogether, our data enforce the evidence of Pi as a novel signaling molecule capable of inhibiting ERK pathway and inducing sensitization to doxorubicin of osteosarcoma cells by p53-dependent apoptosis, implying that targeting Pi levels might represent a rational strategy for improving osteosarcoma therapy.",

Specific cytoplasmic staining for gankyrin was observed in 62.8% (27/43) of HCCs, which was significantly associated with low TNM stage (P = 0.004), no capsular invasion (P = 0.018), no portal venous invasion (P = 0.008), and no intrahepatic metastasis (P = 0.012).

In the Huh-7 human HCC cell line, overexpression of gankyrin up-regulated expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP-5), whereas suppression of gankyrin expression by siRNA down-regulated it. Supression of IGFBP-5 expression inhibited proliferation of Huh-7 cells as well as U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells.

Deciphering the molecular events that trigger and are characteristic of the intersection of these oncogenic and normal processes is critical to affect the often morbid and lethal consequences of malignant tumors of fat. High-resolution genome-wide oligonucleotide array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) with matched gene expression analyses was performed on seven lipomas, one hibernoma, and 38 WD and DDLS to define and compare the genomic events associated with these tumors. WD and DDLS had complex karyotypes. On average, WDLS had 11.1 and DDLS had 22.7 chromosomal copy number aberrations. All of the liposarcomas had 12q13-q15 amplifications with varying peaks at CDK4 (12q14.1), HMGA2 (12q14.3), and MDM2 (12q15); 24% of the DDLS and no WDLS had 1p32.2 (JUN) amplifications; 33% WDLS and 35% DDLS had 1q24.3 amplifications involving DNM3 and miR-214/miR-199a2; 24% of the liposarcomas had 6q23-q24 amplifications (including MAP3K5). Amplifications in GLI1 (12q13.3), JUN, and MAP3K5 (6q23.3) were mutually exclusive and occurred predominately in the DDLS. 6q amplifications occurred primarily in retroperitoneal tumors and females represented the majority of those patients who developed fatty tumors prior to the age of 50 years old. This detailed genetic mapping provides insight into the heterogeneity of WD and DDLS and the chromosomal and genetic abnormalities that are present in and distinguish these mesenchymal malignancies.",

However, occasional retroperitoneal lipomatous tumors show no cytologic atypia. To determine whether these tumors are well-differentiated liposarcomas devoid of cytologic atypia or lipomas was the major aim of this investigation. We comprehensively and prospectively studied 19 retroperitoneal adipocytic tumors devoid of cytologic atypia at the cytogenetic and molecular genetic levels. Median patient age was 56 years (range: 36 to 78 y). Median tumor size was 21 cm (range: 8 to 46 cm) and the median weight was 1127 g (range: 173 to 2440 g). All tumors were well-circumscribed and showed no cytologic atypia. Standard cytogenetic analysis demonstrated rearrangements of 12q15 in 4 (of 7) cases. None showed ring or giant marker chromosomes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization failed to identify amplification of MDM2, carboxypeptidase M(CPM), SAS, CDK4, DDIT3, or HMGA2 in all cases. HMGA2 rearrangement was observed in 8 (of 19) cases (42%) and was more common in larger tumors (P=0.046). HMGA2-LPP fusion was seen in only 1 case. All tumors were completely excised. Follow-up information was available from 10 cases (median, 6 mo; range: 1 to 58 mo). No tumor recurred or metastasized. In contrast, a control group of 20 well-differentiated liposarcomas diagnosed during the same time period (matched per year of diagnosis) showed 4 instances of local recurrence. We conclude that this group of retroperitoneal lipomatous tumors shows clinico-pathologic and genetic features more akin to lipomas than well-differentiated liposarcomas. Owing to their apparent rarity, additional studies are necessary to more fully understand their natural biology in this anatomic location.",

However, the effects of Zhangfei are not universal, and it has no obvious effects on untransformed cells and some cancer cell lines, suggesting that Zhangfei may act through an intermediary that is either not induced or is defective in cells that it does not affect. Here we identify the tumor suppressor protein p53 as this intermediary. We show the following: in cells ectopically expressing Zhangfei, the protein stabilizes p53 and co-localizes with it in cellular nuclei; the bLZip domain of Zhangfei is required for its profound effects on cell growth and interaction with p53. Suppression of p53 by siRNA at least partially inhibits the effects of Zhangfei on the UPR and cell growth. The effects of Zhangfei on D-17 cells is mirrored by its effects on the p53-expressing human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS, while Zhangfei has no effect on the p53-null osteosarcoma cell line MG63. In U2OS cells, Zhangfei displaces the E3 ubiquitin ligase mouse double minute homolog 2 (Mdm2) from its association with p53, suggesting a mechanism for the effects of Zhangfei on p53. ",

Flow cytometry was used to investigate the effect of hypoxia-induced cell cycle arrest on radiosensitivity in KHT-C (mouse fibrosarcoma) cells. Transient transfection was performed to determine the role of altered p53 activity in KHT-C and SCC VII (mouse squamous-cell carcinoma) radiosensitivity.;Aerobic radiosensitivity was decreased in KHT-C and SCC VII cells after in vitro chronic or cyclic hypoxia pretreatment, but in HT1080 cells, it was slightly increased after chronic hypoxia, and was unchanged after acute hypoxia pretreatment. Decreased radiosensitivity in hypoxia-pretreated KHT-C and SCC VII cells was unlikely due to hypoxia-induced cell cycle arrest, but rather seemed to be associated with increased expression of Mdm2 (mouse double minute-2) and decreased p53. Furthermore, hypoxia pretreatment inhibited the activation of p53 by radiation. Similar results were observed in hyperthermia treated KHT-C cells. Finally, decreased radiosensitivity was observed in both KHT-C and SCC VII cells transiently transfected with Mdm2 or anti-sense p53 cDNA.;We demonstrated that hypoxia may decrease tumor cell radiosensitivity through the suppression of p53 activity in some tumor cell lines.

Authors report the case of a 51-year-old man, presenting with epigastralgia of recent onset. Physical exam was unremarkable. Endoscopy revealed a large, ulcerated, submucosal, and antral tumor. CT scan showed an antral mass with fat attenuation. The patient underwent a total gastrectomy. Macroscopic examination identified in the antral wall a 9-cm, well-circumscribed, nodular lesion, with a greasy cut surface. On histological examination, the tumor was composed of a mature adipocytes proliferation, showing significant variation in cell size, associated to some lipoblasts. Nuclei were sometimes large, irregular, neither with hyperchromasia nor mitosis. Diagnosis of a well-differentiated liposarcoma was suspected and molecular cytogenetic analyses showed neither MDM2 nor CDK4 gene amplification on fluorescent in situ hybridization. The diagnosis of lipoma was made. Twelve months after surgery, the patient is doing well. In conclusion, Differentiating benign from malignant fatty tumors is sometimes difficult in morphologic features. In these cases, cytogenetic procedures are the only means for an accurate diagnosis.

In this study, we provided structural models of the complexes between the MDM2-inhibiting p53TAD peptide and Mcl-1, Bcl-w, and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) Bcl-2 using NMR chemical shift perturbation data. The binding mode of the MDM2-inhibiting p53TAD peptide is highly conserved among the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins despite their distinct specificities for pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. We also identified the binding of a phage-display-derived MDM2-inhibiting peptide 12-1 to anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL protein by using NMR spectroscopy. The structural model of the Bcl-XL/12-1 peptide complex revealed that the conserved residues Phe4, Trp8, and Leu11 in the MDM2-inhibiting peptide fit into a hydrophobic cleft of Bcl-XL in a manner similar to that of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) peptides.

Effects of nutlin-3 single treatment were much more pronounced in p53 wild-type cell lines (IC(50)s <3 micromol/L) than in p53-mutated cell lines (IC(50)s >17 micromol/L). In sharp contrast to the expectations, nutlin-3 concentrations that did not affect viability of p53-mutated cell lines strongly increased the efficacy of vincristine in p53-mutated, P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-overexpressing cell lines (decrease in IC(50)s 92- to 3,434-fold). Similar results were obtained for other P-gp substrates. Moreover, nutlin-3 reduced efflux of rhodamine 123 and other fluorescence dyes that are effluxed by P-gp. Investigation of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II cells stably transfected with plasmids encoding for P-gp (MDCKII MDR1) or multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP-1, MDCKII MRP1) revealed that nutlin-3 not only interferes with P-gp but also affects MRP-1-mediated efflux. Kinetic studies and investigation of P-gp-ATPase activity showed that nutlin-3 is likely to act as a P-gp transport substrate. Examination of the nutlin-3 enantiomers nutlin-3a and nutlin-3b revealed that, in contrast to MDM2-inhibitory activity that is limited to nutlin-3a, both enantiomers similarly interfere with P-gp-mediated drug efflux.

Cytogenetic aberrations associated with these tumors thus far described include loss of 1p, 13q, 14q, or 15q, loss of heterozygosity of 22q, numeric chromosomal imbalances, and nuclear/mitochondrial microsatellite instability. Molecular genetic aberrations include loss of heterozygosity of p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF), methylation of p15(INK4B), homozygous loss of the Hox11L1 gene, and amplification of C-MYC, MDM2, EGFR1, and CCND1. GISTs in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 appear to lack the KIT and PDGFRA mutations characteristic of GISTs and may have a different pathogenetic mechanism. Gene mutations of KIT or PDGFRA are critical in GISTs, because the aberrant versions not only are correlated with the specific cell morphology, histologic phenotype, metastasis, and prognosis, but also are the targets of therapy with imatinib and other agents. Furthermore, specific mutations in KIT and PDGFR appear to lead to differential drug sensitivity and may in the future guide selection of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Activation of the receptor tyrosine kinases involves a signal transduction pathway whose components (mitogen-activated protein kinase, AKT, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin, and RAS) are also possible targets of inhibition.

However, little is known about the molecular genetic differences between conventional myxoid (MX) components and RC components in this tumour. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible implications of molecular alterations of G1 to S-phase check-point genes, especially in the RC component. We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of p53, MDM2, p14 and p16 protein and assessed proliferative activities using MIB-1 in 29 RC components and 81 MX components from 90 cases. Mutation of the p53 gene, amplification of the MDM2 gene, homozygous deletion, methylation status and mutation of the p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) genes were also investigated, using concordant paraffin-embedded and frozen material. The data were analysed together with clinicopathological factors to assess their prognostic implications in MLS/RCLS. Immunohistochemically, the over-expression of p53 protein (p = 0.01366) and the reduced expression of p14 (p < 0.0001) and p16 (p < 0.0001) proteins were significantly more frequently observed in RC components than in MX components. Reduced expression of p14 protein correlated significantly with hypermethylation of the p14(ARF) gene promoter (p = 0.0176) and over-expression of p53 protein (p = 0.00837). By univariate analysis, reduced expression of p14 and p53 missense mutation were found to reduce the rate of survival significantly (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis, including clinicopathological factors, revealed that tumour site (p = 0.0251), the presence of an RC component (p = 0.0113), high MIB-1 labelling index (p = 0.0005) and p53 missense mutation (p = 0.0036) were adverse prognostic factors. In MLS/RCLS, reduction of p14 protein expression and p53 mutation were related to poor prognosis. Accordingly, the p14(ARF)/p53 pathway may contribute to the presence of an RC component and malignant progression in this tumour.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Approximately 90% of well-differentiated/de-differentiated liposarcomas (WDLPS/DDLPS), the most common LPS subtype, have chromosomal amplification at 12q13-q22. Many protein-coding genes in the region, such as MDM2 and , have been studied as potential therapeutic targets for LPS treatment, with minimal success. In the amplified region near the MDM2 gene, our single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis of 75 LPS samples identified frequent amplification of miR-26a-2. Besides being in the amplicon, miR-26a-2 was overexpressed significantly in WDLPS/DDLPS (P<0.001), as well as in myxoid/round cell LPS (MRC) (P<0.05). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that overexpression of miR-26a-2 significantly correlated with poor patient survival in both types of LPS (P<0.05 for WDLPS/DDLPS; P<0.001 for MRC). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that miR-26a-2 has an important role in LPS tumorigenesis, regardless of LPS subtypes. Overexpression of miR-26a-2 in three LPS cell lines (SW872, LPS141 and LP6) enhanced the growth and survival of these cells, including faster cell proliferation and migration, enhanced clonogenicity, suppressed adipocyte differentiation and/or resistance to apoptosis. Inhibition of miR-26a-2 in LPS cells using anti-miR-26a-2 resulted in the opposite responses. To explain further the effect of miR-26a-2 overexpression in LPS cells, we performed in silico analysis and identified 93 candidate targets of miR-26a-2. Among these genes, RCBTB1 (regulator of chromosome condensation and BTB domain-containing protein 1) is located at 13q12.3-q14.3, a region of recurrent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in LPS. Indeed, either overexpression or inhibition of RCBTB1 made LPS cells more susceptible or resistant to apoptosis, respectively. In conclusion, our study for the first time reveals the contribution of miR-26a-2 to LPS tumorigenesis, partly through inhibiting RCBTB1, suggesting that miR-26a-2 is a novel therapeutic target for human LPS.",

To ascertain the validity of these criteria, we have reviewed our experience with 301 consecutive differentiated lipomatous tumors in which the diagnosis of ALT could not be established on the basis of histologic sections and in which FISH was performed on the basis of the above criteria. The final diagnosis was based on MDM2 amplification status. Given the nature of this study to evaluate difficult lesions, most cases included (74%) were received in consultation. This enhanced our study series for borderline cases, and the data presented may not be generalizable to adipocytic tumors seen outside a subspecialty setting. Of 301 cases, 108 proved to be ALT/WDL (36%). The most common test indication was size >10 cm (n=187), followed by equivocal atypia (n=145), retroperitoneal/pelvic/abdominal location (n=86), recurrence (n=33), and clinical concern (n=12). Of the tumors >10 cm, 68 (36%) proved to be ALT/WDL, whereas the remainder were interpreted as lipoma or its variants (eg, spindle cell or pleomorphic lipoma). The 2 groups did not differ statistically in size, although ALTs consistently occurred in patients above 50 years of age. Of the cases with equivocal atypia, 72 (50%) proved to be ALT/WDL. Those in the retroperitoneum/abdomen/pelvis were ALT/WDL in 30 cases (35%), and those that had recurred were ALT in 18 cases (55%). Recurrence, atypia, and having multiple indications for testing were more common in ALT than in benign lesions (P=0.02, 0.0001, 0.0012, respectively). No ALT/WDL occurred in the hands and feet, and only a single ALT/WDL was superficial (1 ALT/WDL vs. 60 lipoma/spindle cell or pleomorphic lipoma). Small (<10 cm) retroperitoneal tumors without additional features were always benign (n=9). On the basis of our results, FISH testing is recommended for: (1) recurrent lesions; (2) deep extremity lesions that are >10 cm in patients over 50 years of age; (3) in cases with equivocal atypia; (4) in lesions of the retroperitoneum/pelvis/abdomen, and in special clinical situations as directed by treating clinicians. Testing is low yield in superficial lesions, in small extremity lesions without additional indicators for testing, in large extremity lesions without additional features in patients under the age of 50, and in lesions arising in the hands/feet. More evidence is needed regarding testing in small retroperitoneal lesions without additional features. By adopting these criteria, we could have avoided testing 74 cases, missing a single superficial ALT/WDL. ",

Hibernomas are benign neoplasms that show variable differentiation toward brown fat, and can sometimes occur in the abdomen or retroperitoneum. We illustrate a case of retroperitoneal WDL that showed extensive hibernoma-like morphology, with sheets of multivacuolated adipocytes of varying sizes, with abundant cytoplasm and numerous lipid vacuoles or granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. However, very focally there were fibrous septa containing spindle cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic, mildly pleomorphic nuclei. Further sampling showed areas of typical WDL, with lobules of mature fat intersected by fibrous septa containing atypical, enlarged spindle cells, as well as small foci of dedifferentiation. Immunohistochemistry for CDK4 and p16 showed strong and diffuse nuclear expression in the hibernoma-like areas, and fluorescence in situ hybridization showed MDM2 gene amplification, all in keeping with WDL. We highlight hibernoma-like morphology as part of the histologic spectrum of WDL, and recognition of this variant is important for correct treatment and prognostication. ",

These genes were chosen because of their probable association with tumor development and progression. In some of the tumors and cell lines, p53, E-cadherin and Glut3 genes showed remarkable differences in allelic expression, one allele being poorly expressed. The allele-specificity persisted in nine cell lines obtained by repeated transplantations from one tumor. These results suggest that expression of some genes is allele-specific in tumor cells and the pattern of specificity is stable. Such a decrease or a loss of expression in one of the alleles may be functionally equivalent to the loss of heterozygosity of the gene, and therefore this may confer malignant properties on tumor cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a master regulator of cell growth through its ability to stimulate ribosome biogenesis and mRNA translation. In contrast, the p53 tumor suppressor negatively controls cell growth and is activated by a wide range of insults to the cell. The mTOR and p53 signaling pathways are connected by a number of different mechanisms. Chemotherapeutics that inhibit ribosome biogenesis often induce nucleolar stress and activation of p53. Here we have investigated how the p53 response to nucleolar stress is affected by simultaneous mTOR inhibition in osteosarcoma and glioma cell lines. We found that inhibitors of the mTOR pathway including rapamycin, wortmannin, and caffeine blunted the p53 response to nucleolar stress induced by actinomycin D. Synthetic inhibitors of mTOR (temsirolimus, LY294.002 and PP242) also impaired actinomycin D triggered p53 stabilization and induction of p21. Ribosomal protein (RPL11) is known to be required for p53 protein stabilization following nucleolar stress. Treatment of cells with mTOR inhibitors may lead to reduced synthesis of RPL11 and thereby destabilize p53. We found that rapamycin mimicked the effect of RPL11 depletion in terms of blunting the p53 response to nucleolar stress. However, the extent to which the levels of p53 and RPL11 were reduced by rapamycin varied between cell lines. Additional mechanisms whereby rapamycin blunts the p53 response to nucleolar stress are likely to be involved. Indeed, rapamycin increased the levels of endogenous MDM2 despite inhibition of its phosphorylation at Ser-166. Our findings may have implications for the design of combinatorial cancer treatments with mTOR pathway inhibitors. ",

The IC50 of the most potent ASO, NCH-4401, was subsequently determined and compared to the IC50 of a 2'-MoE-modified ASO, with a complete phosphorothioate backbone (NCH-4668), and to a 3 bp mismatched ASO (NCH4529). NCH4401 inhibited Hdm2 expression in SJSA-1 cells with an IC50 of 120 nm, whereas NCH-4668 was less potent with an IC50 of 180 nm. The mismatched control ASO was completely inactive, indicating a sequence-dependent mechanism of action of NCH-4401. NCH4401 was subsequently used to study the consequences of inhibiting Hdm2 expression in human osteosarcoma cells. NCH-4401 completely inhibited Hdm2 protein expression in SJSA-1 cells at a concentration of 300 nm, already 4 h after start of ASO treatment. At an ASO concentration of 300 nM, p53 protein was induced 12.5-fold and p21 was induced 8-fold over background levels, 24 h after start of ASO treatment. The dramatic induction of p53 in SJSA-1 cells prompted us to investigate whether the accumulation of p53 in these cells was followed by induction of apoptosis. However, no signs for apoptosis were detected in SJSA-1 cells, following induction of wild-type p53 using the Yopro method and the induction of caspase-3 activity. SJSA-1 cells were subsequently treated with NCH-4401 at different concentrations in combination with two well-known DNA-damaging agents, i.e. carboplatin and mitomycin C. Apoptosis induction following treatment of cells with DNA-damaging agents and NCH4401 was determined in parallel by measuring caspase-3 activation and uptake of the DNA dye Yopro. Carboplatin and mitomycin C together only slightly induced apoptosis in SJSA-1 cells to a factor of approximately 2-fold, as measured by the induction of caspase-3 activity.

There are relatively few cell lines of metastatic OS reported in the literature and the cytogenetic aspects of OS metastases are still controversial and inconclusive. Here we describe the establishment of a new OS cell line, M-OS, from a pulmonary metastasis of a typical osteoblastic OS of an 11-year-old boy with metastatic OS at diagnosis. M-OS cells have been maintained in culture for over 50 passages for more than 1 year. M-OS was characterized by immunohistochemistry, conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In order to evaluate in vitro cell modification, the immunohistochemical analysis was performed in three different moments of the cell line: 10th, 30th and 50th passages. The conventional cytogenetic analysis revealed the ploidy of M-OS cell line as near-diploid, with most metaphases hyperdiploid and tetraploid. We found a copy number gain of MDM2 gene as the most frequent alteration in the FISH analysis. The immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that M-OS cell line maintained the osteogenic nature even after all passages for the cell line establishment in vitro.",

RUNX2, which stimulates differentiation and suppresses proliferation of osteoblasts, is deregulated in OS. Here, we define pathological roles of RUNX2 in the etiology of OS and mechanisms by which RUNX2 expression is stimulated. RUNX2 is often highly expressed in human OS biopsies and cell lines. Small interference RNA-mediated depletion of RUNX2 inhibits growth of U2OS OS cells. RUNX2 levels are inversely linked to loss of p53 (which predisposes to OS) in distinct OS cell lines and osteoblasts. RUNX2 protein levels decrease upon stabilization of p53 with the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3. Elevated RUNX2 protein expression is post-transcriptionally regulated and directly linked to diminished expression of several validated RUNX2 targeting microRNAs in human OS cells compared with mesenchymal progenitor cells. The p53-dependent miR-34c is the most significantly down-regulated RUNX2 targeting microRNAs in OS. Exogenous supplementation of miR-34c markedly decreases RUNX2 protein levels, whereas 3'-UTR reporter assays establish RUNX2 as a direct target of miR-34c in OS cells. Importantly, Nutlin-3-mediated stabilization of p53 increases expression of miR-34c and decreases RUNX2. Thus, a novel p53-miR-34c-RUNX2 network controls cell growth of osseous cells and is compromised in OS. ",

However, because high levels of ionizing radiation (IR) are toxic to normal cells, RT cannot be applied repeatedly to cancer patients. Therefore, novel chemicals that enhance the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy (CRT) would be valuable. Here, we report that ELAS1, a peptide corresponding to the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) association domain of cyclin G1 (CycG1), can enhance the efficacy of CRT. ELAS1 interacts with the PP2A B'γ-subunit and competitively inhibits association with CycG1, thereby preventing the PP2A holoenzyme from dephosphorylating target proteins, Mdm2 (pT218) and p53 (pS46), following DNA double-strand break (DSB) insults. Doxycycline (Dox)-induced overexpression of Myc-ELAS1 caused γ-irradiation to induce apoptosis in human osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells, at 1/10th the effective dosage of γ-irradiation required for apoptosis in Myc-vector-expressing cells; ELAS1 peptide incorporation into U2OS cells also showed similar apoptotic effects. Moreover, administration of DSB-inducing chemicals, camptothecin (CPT) or irinotecan, to Myc-ELAS1-expressing U2OS cells also induced efficient apoptosis with only 1/100th (CPT) or 1/5th (irinotecan) of the amounts of drugs required for this effect in Myc-vector-expressing cells. Taken together, ELAS1 may be important for the design of ELAS1-mimetic compounds to improve CRT efficacy. ",

The classical antimitotic treatments are most often inefficient. The establishment of genetically characterized cell lines is therefore crucial for providing in vitro models for novel targeted therapies. We have used spectral karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization with whole chromosome painting and locus-specific probes, and array-comparative genomic hybridization to identify the chromosomal and molecular alterations of a novel cell line established from a recurring sclerosing WDLPS. The karyotype was hypertriploid and showed multiple structural anomalies. All cells retained the presence of a giant marker chromosome that had been previously identified in the primary cell cultures. This giant chromosome contained high-level amplification of chromosomal regions 12q13-21 and lacked the alpha-satellite centromeric sequences associated with WDLPS/DDLPS. The 12q amplicon was large, containing 370 amplified genes. The DNA copy number ranged from 3 to 57. The highest levels of amplification were observed at 12q14.3 for GNS, WIF1, and HMGA2. We analyzed the mRNA expression status by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for six genes from this amplicon: MDM2, HMGA2, CDK4, TSPAN31, WIF1, and YEATS4. mRNA overexpression was correlated with genomic amplification. A second amplicon originating from 10p11-14 was also present in the giant marker chromosome.

In one case (female, age 46 years), the sarcomatous component of the tumor displayed histological features of a pleomorphic liposar-coma. Light microscopic examination revealed a biphasic pattern with a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma(CRCC) and a high-grade sarcomatous component containing large pleomorphic lipoblasts. In several areas both components were intermingled. The conventional CRCC component showed classic histological features with calcifications, medium-sized polygonal cells arranged in solid-alveolar structures with raisinoid nuclei, pale-eosinophilic flocculent cytoplasm with perinuclear haloes. In addition, a microcystic-adenomatous component had luminal spaces filled with erythrocytes. The CRCC was positive with Hale's colloidal iron-stain whereas the sarcomatous component was negative. The CRCC component was diffusely positive for cytokeratin 7, parvalbumin and racemase but negative for cy-tokeratin 20, vimentin, CD10, carboanhydrase IX and S100-protein. The pleomorphic liposarcomatous component displayed immunereactivity for CD10, vimentin, racemase and focally for carboanhydrase IX.

Although sclerosing and spindle cell RMS share clinical and morphologic features, a pathogenetic link based on shared molecular alterations has not been established. Spindle cell RMS in children have been associated with a less aggressive clinical course compared to adults. Recently, recurrent MYOD1 mutations were described in 44% of adult spindle cell RMS, but no pediatric tumors or sclerosing RMS were studied for comparison. Thus, we investigated 16 RMS (5 sclerosing and 11 spindle cell) in children and adults for the presence of MYOD1 mutations by targeted Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Remarkably, all 5 sclerosing RMS and 4 of 11 spindle cell RMS showed the MYOD1 p.L122R hot-spot mutation. Of the five pediatric tumors, 2/2 sclerosing RMS and 2/3 spindle cell RMS showed MYOD1 mutations. Three of nine MYOD1-mutant RMS showed coexistent PIK3CA mutations, while no MDM2 amplifications were identified. All four pediatric MYOD1-mutated RMS patients died of the disease at 12-35 months following diagnosis. In conclusion, spindle cell and sclerosing RMS show recurrent MYOD1 mutations, in keeping with a single pathologic entity, regardless of age at presentation. This group however, is distinct from the infantile RMS associated with NCOA2 fusions. Although our study suggests that pediatric MYOD1-mutant RMS follow an aggressive behavior with high mortality, further studies are required to confirm this finding.",

Although much is known about the function of p14(ARF) in the p53 pathway, not as much is known about its function in human tumor growth and chemosensitivity independently of up-regulation of p53 protein levels. To learn more about its effect on cellular proliferation and chemoresistance independent of p53 up-regulation, human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells null for p14(ARF) and harboring a defective p53 pathway were stably transfected with p14(ARF) cDNA under the tight control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. Induction of p14(ARF) caused a decrease in cell proliferation rate and colony formation and a marked decrease in the level of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein. The effect of p14(ARF) on DHFR protein levels was specific, because thymidylate kinase and thymidylate synthase protein levels were not decreased nor were p53 or p21WAF1 protein levels increased. The decrease in DHFR protein was abolished when the cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, demonstrating that p14(ARF) augments proteasomal degradation of the protein. Surprisingly, induction of p14(ARF) increased resistance to the folate antagonists methotrexate, trimetrexate, and raltitrexed. Depletion of thymidine in the medium reversed this resistance, indicating that p14(ARF) induction increases the reliance of these cells on thymidine salvage.",

Adp14ARF infection of U2OS osteosarcoma cells which has wild type p53 and mutant p14ARF revealed high levels of p14 (ARF) expression within 24h. In addition, Adp14ARF-mediated expressing of p14 (ARF) was associated with increased levels of p53, p21, and mdm2 protein. Growth inhibition assays following Adp14ARF infection demonstrated that the growth of U2OS cells was inhibited relative to infection with control virus. Furthermore, TUNEL analysis as well as PARP cleavage assays demonstrated that Adp14ARF infection was associated with increased apoptosis in U2OS cell line and that it was associated with Adp14ARF induced overexpression of Fas and Fas-L. Addition of Fas-L neutralizing antibody NOK-1 decreased Adp14-mediated cell death, indicating that p14 (ARF) induction of the Fas pathway is associated with increased apoptosis. The finding that Adp14ARF infection did not induce Fas expression in U2OS/E6 and MCF/E6 cells suggests that wild type p53 expression may be necessary for Adp14ARF-mediated induction of Fas. The observation that overexpression of p53 by Adp53 infection in MCF-7 does not induce increased Fas protein levels nor apoptotic cell death suggests that p53 overexpression is required but not sufficient enough for apoptosis.

The tumor suppressor gene RB1, encoding the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, is located at 13q14, within a minimally deleted region in spindle cell lipoma. The purpose of this study was to examine expression of Rb by immunohistochemistry in spindle cell lipoma, pleomorphic lipoma, mammary-type myofibroblastoma, and cellular angiofibroma, and in histologic mimics, to determine its potential diagnostic utility. Whole-tissue sections of 194 tumors were evaluated: 18 spindle cell lipomas, 20 pleomorphic lipomas, 19 mammary-type myofibroblastomas, 16 cellular angiofibromas, 22 conventional lipomas (8 intramuscular), 18 atypical lipomatous tumors (all positive for MDM2 and CDK4), 19 solitary fibrous tumors, 19 myxoid liposarcomas, 14 hibernomas, 11 deep (aggressive) angiomyxomas, 9 angiomyofibroblastomas, and 9 vulval fibroepithelial stromal polyps. Immunohistochemistry was performed after pressure cooker antigen retrieval using a mouse anti-Rb monoclonal antibody. Nuclear staining for Rb was scored as \"intact\" or \"deficient.\" Rb expression was deficient in all spindle cell lipomas, pleomorphic lipomas, and cellular angiofibromas and in 17 (89%) mammary-type myofibroblastomas. Rb staining was sometimes difficult to interpret in cellular angiofibromas with reactive stromal changes. Rb was also deficient in 2 (9%) conventional lipomas. Rb expression was intact in all other tumor types evaluated. In summary, of the soft tissue tumors associated with 13q deletions, all spindle cell lipomas, pleomorphic lipomas, and cellular angiofibromas and most mammary-type myofibroblastomas show loss of Rb expression. Rb expression is intact in histologic mimics.

We have identified NS as a target of oxidative regulation in transformed hematopoietic cells. NS oligomerization occurs in HL-60 leukemic cells and Raji B lymphoblasts that express high levels of c-Myc and have high intrinsic levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS); reducing agents dissociate NS into monomers and dimers. Exposure of U2OS osteosarcoma cells with low levels of intrinsic ROS to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) induces thiol-reversible disulfide bond-mediated oligomerization of NS. Increased exposure to H(2)O(2) impairs NS degradation, immobilizes the protein within the nucleolus, and results in detergent-insoluble NS. The regulation of NS by ROS was validated in a murine lymphoma tumor model in which c-Myc is overexpressed and in CD34+ cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis. In both instances, increased ROS levels were associated with markedly increased expression of NS protein and thiol-reversible oligomerization. Site-directed mutagenesis of critical cysteine-containing regions of nucleostemin altered both its intracellular localization and its stability. MG132, a potent proteasome inhibitor and activator of ROS, markedly decreased degradation and increased nucleolar retention of NS mutants, whereas N-acetyl-L-cysteine largely prevented the effects of MG132. These results indicate that NS is a highly redox-sensitive protein. Increased intracellular ROS levels, such as those that result from oncogenic transformation in hematopoietic malignancies, regulate the ability of NS to oligomerize, prevent its degradation, and may alter its ability to regulate cell proliferation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"A murine erythroleukemic cell line (1-2-3) which expresses only the temperature-sensitive mutant p53 gene (Ala-to-Val substitution at codon 135) was established. These cells showed typical characteristics of apoptosis, when they were cultured at 32 degrees C. In this process, p53 recovered the wild-type p53 function and the expression of the p21 (waf1/cip1/sdi1), cyclin G1 and gadd45 genes was increased. However, no significant changes were detected in the expression of the mdm2, bcl-2, bax, fas and fasl genes, suggesting the existence of other genes associated with apoptosis. Genes up-regulated by p53 were screened by the mRNA differential display method. One of the up-regulated genes was identified as the elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) gene. EF-1 alpha is also a microtubule-severing protein. Upon the temperature-shift, the cells developed the morphology and the localization of alpha-tubulin similar to those of the cells treated with vincristine, a drug that affects microtubules. The microtubule-severing associated with up-regulation of EF-1 alpha by p53 may be a cause of the cell death. On the other hand, the function of cyclin G1 is not so clear despite the fact that 1-2-3 cells showed a significant increase of the cyclin G1 gene during the early stage of apoptosis. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify cyclin G1-associated proteins. One is a cytochrome c (Cyt c) oxidase subunit II (COXII). Cyclin G1 and COXII were co-immunoprecipitated from an extract of human osteosarcoma cell line that expressed high levels of cyclin G1. COX activity was also increased by temperature-shift in this cell line. The pattern of changes in COX activity was closely reflected by the expression of the cyclin G1 gene. Cyclin G1 and COXII associate physically with each other in vivo and that activation of COXII by binding to cyclin G1 upregulated by p53 may be associated with apoptosis. These two new pathways, p53-EF-1 alpha-microtubule-severing (-distortion of cytoskeleton) and p53-cyclin G1-COXII (-CytC, ATP-caspase-3 activation), may cooperate to induce apoptosis in this cell line.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Nutlin-3 is a small-molecule antagonist of murine double minute 2 (MDM2) that blocks its binding to p53, leading to an increase in p53 protein levels. The tumor suppressor p53 induces growth arrest or apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress. Along with its growth-suppressive effect, it has been reported that p53 stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway via the upregulation of heparin- binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand, and discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), a tyrosine kinase receptor, at the transcription level. In this study, we propose a novel mechanism involved in the p53-induced MAPK activation. Nutlin-3 induced the phosphorylation of EGFR, MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)1/2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in U2OS human osteosarcoma cells harboring wild-type p53. This phosphorylation was completely inhibited by p53 siRNA, but not by pifithrin (PFT)-α, an inhibitor of the trans-criptional activity of p53. While the nutlin-3-induced EGFR phosphorylation was prevented by the inactivation of ERK1/2, the nutlin-3-induced MEK1/2-ERK1/2 phosphorylation was still observed in the cells in which EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited using EGFR siRNA and AG1478, an inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase. Of note, nutlin-3 caused the accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and this correlated with the mitochondrial translocation of p53. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO), a ROS scavenger, prevented the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. PFT-μ, which prevented the mitochondrial localization of p53, suppressed ERK1/2 phosphorylation, as well as ROS accumulation. Finally, we analyzed the effect of ERK1/2 activation on nutlin-3-induced apoptosis. The knockdown of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activity using U0126, a MEK inhibitor, or siRNAs, resulted in the enhancement of nutlin-3-induced apoptosis. In addition, TEMPO and PFT-μ also promoted nutlin-3-induced apoptosis. Taking the above findings into account, it can be concluded that nutlin-3 activates ERK1/2 prior to EGFR phosphorylation via ROS generation following the mitochondrial translocation of p53 and that nutlin-3-induced ERK1/2 activation may play a role in protecting U2OS cells from p53-dependent apoptosis, constituting a negative feedback loop for p53-induced apoptosis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Six p53 wild-type cancer cell lines from infrequently p53-mutated entities (neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and melanoma) were continuously exposed to increasing concentrations of the murine double minute 2 inhibitor nutlin-3, resulting in the emergence of nutlin-3-resistant, p53-mutated sublines displaying a multi-drug resistance phenotype. Only 2 out of 28 sublines adapted to various cytotoxic drugs harboured p53 mutations. Nutlin-3-adapted UKF-NB-3 cells (UKF-NB-3(r)Nutlin(10 μM), harbouring a G245C mutation) were also radiation resistant. Analysis of UKF-NB-3 and UKF-NB-3(r)Nutlin(10 μM) cells by RNA interference experiments and lentiviral transduction of wild-type p53 into p53-mutated UKF-NB-3(r)Nutlin(10 μM) cells revealed that the loss of p53 function contributes to the multi-drug resistance of UKF-NB-3(r)Nutlin(10 μM) cells. Bioinformatics PANTHER pathway analysis based on microarray measurements of mRNA abundance indicated a substantial overlap in the signalling pathways differentially regulated between UKF-NB-3(r)Nutlin(10 μM) and UKF-NB-3 and between UKF-NB-3 and its cisplatin-, doxorubicin-, or vincristine-resistant sublines. Repeated nutlin-3 adaptation of neuroblastoma cells resulted in sublines harbouring various p53 mutations with high frequency. A p53 wild-type single cell-derived UKF-NB-3 clone was adapted to nutlin-3 in independent experiments. Eight out of ten resulting sublines were p53-mutated harbouring six different p53 mutations. This indicates that nutlin-3 induces de novo p53 mutations not initially present in the original cell population. Therefore, nutlin-3-treated cancer patients should be carefully monitored for the emergence of p53-mutated, multi-drug-resistant cells.",
