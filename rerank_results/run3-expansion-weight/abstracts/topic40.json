        "Doc_abstract":"Breast cancer is the second highest cause of carcinoma-related death caused by distant metastasis in women. Estrogen receptor (ER), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, (HER2) and progesterone receptor (PR) are three classified makers of breast cancer, which are defined as ER+, HER2+, and the most serious ER-PR-HER2- (triple-negative). It is well known that ErbB2 (V-Erb-B2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2) plays an important part in breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ErbB2 action needs to be well studied. In this report, we discovered that the decreased expression levels of miR-34a were inversely correlated with the increased ErbB2 levels in breast cancer. A luciferase reporter assay was done to understand the potential correlation between ErbB2 and miR-34a. Over-expression of miR-34a reduces ErbB2 expression and suppresses breast cancer cell invasion and growth in vitro. What's more, reduced expression of ErbB2 inhibits breast Cancer cell proliferation and re-expression of ErbB2 reversed miR-34a-dependent tumor suppression. Meanwhile, miR-34a levels were correlated inversely with breast cancer malignancy. Our study demonstrates that miR-34a, like ErbB2, might be a diagnostic target in breast cancer.",

In mammary gland development, this receptor plays a role in ductal and lobuloalveolar differentiation. We conducted a systematic investigation of the role of genetic variation of the ERBB2 gene in breast cancer risk in a study of 842 histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer cases and 1,108 controls from the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study. We observed that the ERBB2 gene resides within a locus of high linkage disequilibrium, composed of three major ancestral haplotypes in the study population. These haplotypes are marked by simple tandem repeat and single nucleotide polymorphisms, including the missense variants I655V and P1170A. We observed a risk-modifying effect of a highly polymorphic simple tandem repeat within an evolutionarily conserved region, 4.4 kb upstream from the ERBB2 transcription start site. Under a dominant genetic model, the age-adjusted odds ratio was 1.74 (95% confidence interval, 1.27-2.37). Its association with breast cancer, and with breast cancer stratified by histology, by histologic grade, and by stage, remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons.

ErbB2-positive breast cancer is tend to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer and therefore further investigation on the signaling pathways of erbB2 is needed for the therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment. Here we report that microRNA-205 (miR-205), a molecule also reported to be associated with breast cancer, is negatively regulated by erbB2 overexpression. Breast epithelial cells exogenously overexpressed with erbB2 decreased the expression of miR-205, whereas increased the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). The decreased expression of miR-205 slightly increased by the transfection of erbB2 siRNA into the erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer epithelial cells. Overexpression of erbB2 enabled breast epithelial cells to grow anchorage-independently in soft agar, and the transfection of the precursor of miR-205 into the cells leaded to the decrease in the ability to grow in soft agar. These results suggest that down-regulation of miR-205 in erbB2-overexpressing breast epithelial cells is essential for erbB2-induced tumorigenesis, and miR-205 may have the potential to be a novel important alternative therapeutic target for erbB2-positive breast cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Breast cancer displays significant intratumoral heterogeneity, which has been shown to have a substantial impact on both innate and acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The heterogeneous expression of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) in cancers supports tumor signaling robustness and plays a significant role in resistance to targeted inhibition. Recent studies have revealed interactions between the MET receptor and the ERBB receptor family in the therapeutic resistance of several cancers. In this study, the relationship between MET expression/activity and the expression/activity of the ERBB receptor family in human breast cancer was interrogated. Importantly, a significant percentage of ERBB2(+) tumors coexpressing MET and ERBB2 were observed and displayed significant heterogeneity with subpopulations of cells that are MET(-)/ERBB2(+), MET(+)/ERBB2(-), and MET(+)/ERBB2(+). In a MET(+)/ERBB2(+) breast cancer cell line, MET depletion resulted in increased ERBB2 activation, and conversely, ERBB2 depletion resulted in increased MET activation. Neither EGFR nor ERBB3 compensated for MET or ERBB2 knockdown. The loss of either MET or ERBB2 led to a decrease in PI3K/AKT signaling and increased dependency on MAPK. These data show that a subset of ERBB2(+) breast cancers express MET and contain MET(+)/ERBB2(+) subpopulations. Moreover, analysis of RTK activation during ERBB2 knockdown indicated that MET signaling is a compensatory pathway of resistance.;ERBB2(+) breast cancers with MET(+)/ERBB2(+) subpopulations may have an innate resistance to ERBB2 inhibition and may benefit from combined MET and ERBB2 inhibition.",

In contrast to the epithelial growth factor receptor (ErbB1), ErbB2 is not downregulated by ligand-induced mechanisms. Here we show that flotillins are involved in the stabilization of ErbB2 at the plasma membrane. In SKBR3 breast cancer cells and breast cancer tissue, a positive correlation between flotillin and ErbB2 expression levels could be demonstrated. Moreover, the tissue microarray analyses of biopsies from 194 patients diagnosed with carcinomas of the breast showed that flotillin-2 emerged as a potential predictor of prognosis in breast cancer. Depletion of flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 leads to internalization and degradation of ErbB2. Furthermore, flotillin-1 and -2 were found to be in a molecular complex with ErbB2 and Hsp90. The depletion of one of these proteins results in disruption of this complex, followed by destabilization of ErbB2 at the membrane, and its internalization and degradation. As a consequence, ErbB2-triggered downstream signalling is inhibited. Our data demonstrate a novel mechanism for interfering with ErbB2 signalling, which potentially can have clinical impact. ",

However, resistance to these therapies can develop. Because epigenetic mechanisms can importantly influence oncogene expression and be druggable as well, we investigated histone modifications that influence ErbB2 overexpression, independent of gene amplification. We demonstrate here that ErbB2-overexpressing breast carcinomas acquire the H3K4me3 mark on the erbB2 promoter and that receptor-amplified tumors further acquire the H3K9ac mark, which is dependent on H3K4me3 mark acquisition. Targeting WD repeat domain 5 (Wdr5), which is absolutely required for H3K4me3 enrichment, decreased ErbB2 overexpression, associated with a decrease in the H3K4me3 mark on the erbB2 promoter. Of note, Wdr5 silencing cooperated with trastuzumab or chemotherapy in specifically inhibiting the growth of ErbB2-positive breast tumor cells.

Five ductal carcinomas in situ overexpressed ERBB2 and showed preserved E-CD expression. Forty-four of 226 infiltrating ductal carcinomas (19.47%) showed ERBB2 overexpression, and a statistically significant relationship was found between ERBB2 overexpression and high histological grade. E-CD expression was preserved in 111 cases (49.1%) and correlated with the histological grade. However, no significant relationship was found between ERBB2 and E-CD expression. None of the 16 infiltrating lobular carcinomas expressed ERBB2 or E-CD.

Analysis of paired breast cancer and blood samples from informative (G1170C heterozygotic) ERBB2-positive (n = 12) and ERBB2-negative (n = 17) cases not only confirmed monoallelic amplification and ERBB2 transcriptional overexpression but also revealed that most low ERBB2 expressing breast cancers (12/17) exhibit unbalanced allelic transcription, showing 3-fold to nearly 5,000-fold preferential expression from one of two inherited alleles. To explore cis-acting transcriptional mechanisms potentially selected during ERBB2 amplification, levels of four different ERBB2 transcript variants (5.2, 4.7, 2.1, and 1.4 kb) were correlated with total (4.6 kb) ERBB2 mRNA levels in ERBB2-positive (n = 14) versus ERBB2-negative (n = 43) primary breast cancers. Relative expression of only the 2.1 kb extracellular domain-encoding splice variant and a 4.7 kb mRNA variant that uses an alternative start site were significantly increased in association with ERBB2-positivity, implicating altered promoter usage and selective transcript regulation within the ERBB2 amplicon.

The relative ERBB2 copy number determined by FISH in 10 breast cancer cell lines correlated strongly with Southern blot results (r = 0.98) when probes for an identical reference locus were used in the two methods. Metaphase analysis of cell lines showed that amplified ERBB2 copies always occurred in intrachromosomal clusters but that the number and chromosomal location of these clusters varied among the cell lines. In interphase nuclei of primary tumors showing ERBB2 amplification (10/44), ERBB2 copies were seen as one to four clusters, also suggesting intrachromosomal localization. Regardless of the average level of amplification, all these tumors contained highly amplified cell subpopulations with at least 25, and sometimes more than 100, ERBB2 copies per cell. Tumors that did not show amplification by FISH (34/44) had an average of one to five ERBB2 copies scattered randomly in the nuclei and completely lacked cells with high copy levels.

The prognostic relevance of ERBB2-regulated and all additional Bcl-2 family members was determined in 782 patients with untreated node-negative breast cancer. The biological relevance of ERBB2-induced inhibition of apoptosis was validated in a murine tumor model allowing conditional ERBB2 expression.;ERBB2 caused an antiapoptotic phenotype by upregulation of MCL-1, TEGT, BAG1, BNIP1, and BECN1 as well as downregulation of BAX, BMF, BNIPL, CLU, and BCL2L13. Upregulation of the antiapoptotic MCL-1 [P = 0.001, hazard ratio (HR) 1.5] and BNIP3 (P = 0.024; HR, 1.4) was associated with worse prognosis considering metastasis-free interval, whereas clusterin (P = 0.008; HR, 0.88) and the proapoptotic BCL2L13 (P = 0.019; HR, 0.45) were associated with better prognosis. This indicates that ERBB2 alters the expression of Bcl-2 family members in a way that leads to adverse prognosis.

In a murine model of breast cancer, expression of Brk was found to shorten the latency of ErbB2-induced tumors by promoting cell proliferation, with no effect on protection from apoptosis.

Several efficacious targeted therapies, including antibodies and kinase inhibitors, have been developed but the occurring of resistance to these agents is often observed. New therapeutic agents targeting the endocytic recycling and intracellular trafficking of membrane in tumor cells overexpressing ErbB2 are actually in clinical development. Nevertheless the mechanisms underlying ErbB2 downregulation are still obscure. We have previously demonstrated that the overexpression of the p130Cas adaptor protein in ErbB2 positive breast cancer, promotes tumor aggressiveness and progression. Here we demonstrate that lowering p130Cas expression in breast cancer cells is sufficient to induce ErbB2 degradation by autophagy. Conversely, p130Cas overexpression protects ErbB2 from degradation by autophagy. Furthermore, this autophagy-dependent preferential degradation of ErbB2 in absence of p130Cas is due to an increased ErbB2 ubiquitination. Indeed, the overexpression of p130Cas impairs ErbB2 ubiquitination by inhibiting the binding of Cbl and CHIP E3 ligases to ErbB2. Finally, our results indicate that p130Cas-dependent ErbB2 protection from degradation by autophagy may alter the sensitivity to the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab. Consistently, in human ErbB2 positive breast cancers that develop resistance to trastuzumab, p130Cas expression is significantly increased suggesting that elevated levels of p130Cas can be involved in trastuzumab resistance.",

In contrast to some well-documented genomic amplifications, molecular mechanisms leading to ERBB2 transcriptional overexpression remain poorly characterized. Gene expression analyses of breast cancer have characterized distinct transcriptional signatures allowing a molecular classification of breast carcinoma. Coexpression of the ERBB2 and GATA4 genes was originally observed in tumors. Both genes are essential for cardiovascular development and GATA4 has been proposed to control the transcription of critical genes for the differentiation and the function of myocardium. We determined that ERBB2-targeted small interfering RNA repressed both ERBB2 and GATA4 genes, whereas GATA4-targeted small interfering RNA repressed GATA4 and activated ERBB2 transcription. Transfected GATA4-expressing construct repressed ERBB2 promoter. Phylogenetic foot printing revealed multiple putative GATA4 binding sites conserved in mammals within the ERBB2 promoter region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that GATA4 binds specifically to several ERBB2 gene noncoding regions. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed GATA4 binding to a well-conserved consensus motif. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the role of this new regulatory element for the activity of the ERBB2 gene enhancer. In agreement with a repressor role of GATA4 on ERBB2 gene expression balanced by ERBB2 activation of the GATA4 gene, a negative correlation between the relative levels of ERBB2 and GATA4 mRNA was observed in breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor samples.

To understand the mechanism of differential response to these two regimens, we have evaluated the effect of signaling through the ErbB2 receptor on downstream enzymes that may affect drug response, using two different models. The first system employs breast cancer cells that have high levels of endogenous ErbB2 by gene amplification (BT-474 and SKBR3 cells). The second system allows us to isolate the effect of ErbB2 receptor-mediated intracellular signaling using an epidermal growth factor receptor-ErbB2 chimeric receptor activated by epidermal growth factor. Our experiments show that the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin is inhibited in ErbB2+ breast cancer cells by the anti-ErbB2 antibody, Herceptin. This is accompanied by a decrease in topoisomerase (topo) IIalpha protein and activity, suggesting that this is the mechanism of change in doxorubicin response. In addition, a 10-100-fold (1-2 log) decrease in the LD(50) of doxorubicin is seen after ErbB2 activation using the chimeric receptor model. Furthermore, we see a 100-fold decrease in the LD(50) of etoposide, another topo II inhibitor. This increase in doxorubicin sensitivity is associated with a 4.5-fold increase in the amount of topo IIalpha protein and an increase in topo II activity as measured by DNA decatenating and unknotting activities, as well as cleavable complex formation. In contradistinction to doxorubicin, we have observed an increased resistance to cyclophosphamide chemotherapy after chimeric receptor activation. We propose that the differential benefit seen with doxorubicin- versus alkylator-based chemotherapy in ErbB2+ breast cancer is due, in some cases, to ErbB2-mediated topo IIalpha activation. These data also suggest hypotheses for the optimal sequencing of Herceptin and chemotherapy agents in ErbB2+ breast cancer.",

The deregulation is the consequence of an increased transcription level and gene amplification. Several laboratories, including our own, have identified, in the proximal promoter, enhancers implicated in the gene overexpression. However, our previous studies of a 6-kb ERBB2 promoter fragment revealed the presence of repressing fragments, which were able to overcome the effect of the proximal enhancers. These repressing elements were functional in all cell lines, regardless of their endogenous ERBB2 expression level. Here, we show that a distal ERBB2 promoter region restores high transcription rates specifically in ERBB2 overexpressing breast cancer cells. This distal promoter region thus contains enhancers essential for the overexpression of the gene. By EMSA, performed with nuclear extract of cells overexpressing (BT-474) or not (MDA-MB-231) the ERBB2 gene, we show that at least two sequences of the distal promoter region are bound exclusively by BT-474 extract. Further experiments reveal that AP-2 transcription factors contribute to this differential binding activity, by binding recognition sequences located 4500 bp and 4000 bp upstream of the transcription start site. These sites are occupied by AP2 in vivo, as demonstrated by ChIP assay. Inactivation of AP-2 proteins in ERBB2 overexpressing cells reduces the distal promoter activity up to 70%, indicating the AP-2 factors are implicated in the strong distal enhancing effect. Moreover, we identified a 54-bp fragment that is bound specifically by BT-474 nuclear extract. Further experiments did not lead to the identification of the protein responsible for this binding.

The library was panned against 2 different purified forms of the external domain of ErbB2. This resulted in the identification of several ErbB2-binding phage clones with variable binding to different ErbB2 preparations. One clone (EC-1) bound all preparations of ErbB2 including live cells and fresh frozen human breast cancer specimens. The synthetic peptide based on the deduced sequence of the EC-1 clone and its biotin-conjugated form retained binding affinity for purified ErbB2 and ErbB2 overexpressing cell lysates. EC-1 peptide was able to effectively inhibit the phosphorylation of ErbB2 on residues Y1248 and Y877 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, EC-1 peptide selectively inhibits the proliferation of ErbB2 overexpressing breast cancer cells. The linear portion of the cyclic EC-1 peptide was shown to be essential for binding ErbB2. In addition, 4 biased phage libraries were constructed allowing 4 different regions of the EC-1 peptide to have random sequence. Screening these EC-1 biased libraries did not result in higher affinity peptides but did demonstrate the importance of amino acids at position 1-4 on the N-terminal flanking arm and 11-15 within the cyclic ring. Interestingly, EC-1 contains homologous motifs with known ErbB receptor family ligands. We have identified a small peptide that binds to the extracellular domain of ErbB2, inhibits ErbB2 autophosphorylation and inhibits the proliferation of ErbB2 overexpressing cells. This supports the notion that small peptides can bind to targets important in cancer therapy even if a target does not have a natural ligand.

        "Doc_abstract":"The recent development of targeted therapies using monoclonal antibodies has added new dimensions to breast cancer treatment. Trastuzumab has been added to the regimens that contain chemotherapeutic agents, which has improved the clinical outcomes of patients in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings. However, trastuzumab resistance, both de novo and acquired, continues to be problematic. There have been scattered studies reporting ERBB2 gene mutation, but nothing is currently known about the ERBB2 binding site mutations. In the current study, we examined the ERBB2 juxtamembrane domain trastuzumab binding site for mutations in invasive breast cancers overexpressing ERBB2. Pure tumor cells of 54 breast cancer patients were procured using laser capture microdissection. Two polymerase chain reaction primer pairs were designed to amplify the trastuzumab binding site sequence. The polymerase chain reaction product was sequenced. Standard clinicopathological data were recorded. For the 54 patients, there was one (2%) case that showed missense point mutation in exon 17 (H559A). There were nine patients treated with trastuzumab in the metastatic setting, none of which had gene mutation. Therefore, we conclude that ERBB2 juxtamembrane domain (trastuzumab binding site) gene mutation is a rare event in breast cancer. Although it is unclear whether this substitution would result in trastuzumab target therapy resistance, this would not account for the relatively high frequency of this resistance encountered clinically.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The erbB2 receptor is expressed at very high levels in nearly 30% of human breast cancer patients and plays an important role in the transformation and the prognosis of breast cancer. While evidence accumulates to support the relationship between erbB2 overexpression and poor overall survival in human breast cancer, understanding of the biological consequence(s) of erbB2 overexpression remains elusive. Our recent discovery, cloning, sequencing, and expression of the erbB2 ligand (gp30) has allowed us to identify a number of related but distinct biological endpoints which appear responsive to signal transduction through the erbB2 receptor. These endpoints of growth, invasiveness, and differentiation have clear implications for the emergence, maintenance, and/or control of malignancy, and represent established endpoints in the assessment of malignant progression in breast cancer. Studies in vitro have shown that gp30 induces a biphasic growth effect (induction of growth at low concentrations and inhibition of growth at high concentrations) on cells with erbB2 over-expression. Strikingly, we have recently observed that the erbB2 signalling pathway can be modulated by estrogen acting through the estrogen receptor (ER). Conversely, we observed that down regulation of erbB2 by estrogen can be blocked by gp30 acting through the erbB2 receptor. Clearly, mechanistic aspects of the erbB2/ligand interaction need to be understood from a therapeutic standpoint, and may furthermore provide additional insights into treatment synergy for particular patients. We think that these studies will facilitate the emergence of erbB2-targeted therapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Resistance to anti-ErbB2 agents is a significant problem in the treatment of human ErbB2+ breast cancers. We show here that adhesion of human ErbB2+ breast cancer cells to basement membrane laminin-5 provides substantial resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib, agents that respectively target the extracellular and kinase domains of ErbB2. Knockdown of laminin-binding integrins (alpha6beta4, alpha3beta1) or associated tetraspanin protein CD151 reversed laminin-5 resistance and sensitized ErbB2+ cells to trastuzumab and lapatinib. CD151 knockdown, together with trastuzumab treatment, inhibited ErbB2 activation and downstream signaling through Akt, Erk1/2, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Hence, ErbB2 function in mammary tumor cells is promoted by integrin-mediated adhesion to laminin-5, with strong support by CD151, leading to signaling through FAK. Consequently, removal or inhibition of any of these components (laminin-5, integrin, CD151, FAK) markedly sensitizes cells to anti-ErbB2 agents. These new insights should be useful when devising strategies for overcoming drug resistance in ErbB2+ cancers.",

Confocal microscopy was used to observe the nuclear import of ERBB2 and caveolin-1 after irradiation. Western blotting was employed to detect the expression of ERBB2, caveolin-1 and DNA-PKcs after irradiation, and immunoprecipitation to identify the ERBB2 and caveolin-1 complex before perinuclear ERBB2 localization. Confocal microscopy showed the transport of ERBB2 and caveolin-1 from the cell membrane to the nucleus 15 min after irradiation and the proteins accumulated at the perinuclear region within 45 min. Western blotting revealed that the expression levels of ERBB2, caveolin-1 and DNA-PKcs were increased after irradiation and reached a peak 45 min later. Both herceptin and PP2 treatments were found to decrease ERBB2 expression. An immune complex composed of ERBB2 and caveolin-1 was found in the herceptin group after irradiation. It was concluded that after irradiation, ERBB2 may be transported from the cell membrane to the nucleus and activate DNA-PKcs to trigger DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair; caveolin-1 may participate in this process.

        "Doc_abstract":"Molecular apocrine is a subtype of estrogen receptor-negative (ER.) breast cancer, which is characterized by a steroid-response gene signature that includes androgen receptor, FOXA1, and a high frequency of ErbB2 overexpression. In this study, we demonstrate that there is a strong association between the overexpression of FOXA1 and ErbB2 in ER- breast tumors. This has led us to identify a cross-regulation network between FOXA1 and ErbB2 signaling in ER- breast cancer. We present two mechanisms to explain the association between FOXA1 and ErbB2 overexpression in molecular apocrine cells. In one process, ErbB2 signaling genes CREB1 and c-Fos regulate FOXA1 transcription, and in another process, AP2α regulates the expression of both FOXA1 and ErbB2. Moreover, we demonstrate that FOXA1, in turn, regulates the transcription of ErbB2 signaling genes. This includes a core gene signature that is shared across two molecular apocrine cell lines. Importantly, the most upregulated (RELB) and downregulated (PAK1) genes in this signature are direct FOXA1 targets. Our data suggest that FOXA1 acts as a dual-function transcription factor and the repressive function of FOXA1 on RELB can be explained by the recruitment of its binding partner corepressor TLE3. It is notable that a group of FOXA1-regulated genes vary across molecular apocrine cell lines leading to the differences in the functional effects of FOXA1 on extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and cell viability between these lines. This study demonstrates that there is a cross-regulation network between FOXA1 and ErbB2 signaling that connects FOXA1 to some of the key signaling pathways in ER-breast cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"ErbB2 is frequently highly expressed in premalignant breast cancers, including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); however, little is known about the signals or pathways it contributes to progression into the invasive/malignant state. Radiotherapy is often used to treat early premalignant lesions regardless of ErbB2 status. Here, we show that clinically relevant doses of ionizing radiation (IR)-induce cellular invasion of ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells, as well as MCF10A cells overexpressing ErbB2. ErbB2-negative breast cancer cells, such as MCF7 and T47D, do not invade following treatment with IR nor do MCF10A cells overexpressing epidermal growth factor receptor. ErbB2 becomes phosphorylated at tyrosine 877 in a dose- and time- dependent manner following exposure to X-rays, and activates downstream signaling cascades including PI3K/Akt. Inhibition of these pathways, as well as inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with antioxidants, prevents IR-induced invasion. Activation of ErbB2-dependent signaling results in upregulation of the forkhead family transcription factor, FoxM1, and its transcriptional targets, including matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). Inhibition of FoxM1 by RNA interference prevented induction of invasion by IR, and overexpression of FoxM1 in MCF10A cells was sufficient to promote IR-induced invasion. Moreover, we found that 14-3-3ζ is also upregulated by IR in cancer cells in a ROS-dependent manner, is required for IR-induced invasion in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells and together with FoxM1 is sufficient for invasion in ErbB2-negative breast cancer cells. Thus, our data show that IR-mediated activation of ErbB2 and induction of 14-3-3ζ collaborate to regulate FoxM1 and promote invasion of breast cancer cells and furthermore, may serve as therapeutic targets to enhance radiosensitivity of breast cancers.

The initial cause of amplification and the exact borders of ERBB2-amplified chromosome fragment are still not completely characterized.

This study focused on the mapping of ERBB2 amplification borders in breast cancer and the search for unusual structural features of DNA at the borders of the identified amplicons. The copy number of 10 genes adjacent to ERBB2 were evaluated by real time PCR in 162 breast cancer samples. Several ERBB2-containing amplicons of various lengths were revealed. In the majority of the analyzed samples, the borders of these amplicons were located within ZNFNIA3 and RARA genes. A bioinformatics analysis of the nucleotide sequence peculiarities around ERBB2 gene revealed the presence of AT-rich DNA regions with high degree of flexibility. These regions were able to form stable secondary structures. Positions of these sites strongly coincide with the positions of the ERBB2-containing amplicon borders found in real time PCR experiments.

The confirmed variants Ile654Val, Ile655Val and Ala1170Pro were analysed in subsequent epidemiological studies on familial breast cancer risk. While Ala1170Pro resides within a C-terminally located regulatory domain, the two adjacent polymorphisms Ile654Val and Ile655Val are part of the transmembrane domain. A case-control study analysing a cohort of 348 German familial breast cancer cases and 960 corresponding controls showed no significant association of either Ile655Val (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.82-1.34, P = 0.728) or Ala1170Pro (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.74-1.20, P = 0.632) with familial breast cancer risk.

The rare Val654 variant is linked with the more frequent Val655, resulting in two consecutive valine instead of two isoleucine residues within the transmembrane domain.

The present study reveals that a polymorphism (rs12976445) within the pri-miR-125a sequence correlates with the amount of mature hsa-miR-125a in breast tumor samples. miRNA, RNA and DNA were extracted from breast cancer samples obtained from 26 patients. Following immunohistological evaluation of the samples, the ERBB2, PGR and ESR1 mRNA profiles were also analyzed using real-time PCR. Genomic DNA was sequenced using MIR125A flanking primers. PCR products were analyzed using a BaeGI restriction enzyme specific to the rs12976445 variant. The rs12976445 variant (C/T and C/C) correlated with a lower level of hsa-miR-125a in comparison with the T/T variant. The expression of HER2 mRNA was increased in tumors with the rs12976445 variant (C/T and C/C) compared with T/T. We conclude that rs12976445 may be a potential prognostic marker of HER2 expression in breast cancer. Its predictive value on the efficacy of trastuzumab treatment in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer warrants further study.",

Due to the co-location of ERBB2 and DLX4 in the 17q21 region, its copy number was also evaluated. Our results in the analysis of 66 cases demonstrated copy number gains of DLX4 and ERBB2 in 24.1 and 29.7% of the cases, respectively. Linear regression analysis showed no dependency between the copy number alterations in these genes. Although not significant, patients with DLX4 and ERBB2 gains presented a higher frequency of advanced-grade tumors. In addition, copy number alterations of these genes were not significantly differently observed in the 3 main racial groups of the Western Cape population: Colored, White, and Black.

        "Doc_abstract":"Breast cancer cell lines display a wide variety of growth factor receptors, and considerable evidence implicates signaling from these receptors, especially ErbB2, in the important early stages of this disease, contributing to malignant progression. If this is true, then we would hypothesize that a useful prognostic indicator would be the level of activity of a second messenger protein used in common by these receptors. One such second messenger is the Shc adapter protein, which is activated when tyrosine phosphorylated by receptors. Therefore, one prediction from the hypothesis is that the level of tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc (PY-Shc) in breast cancer cell lines would correlate with total receptor tyrosine kinase activity. To begin to test this prediction, we examined Shc tyrosine phosphorylation in a diverse group of breast cancer cell lines that display varied levels of ErbB2. Using Shc immunoprecipitation and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting analysis, we found a strong correlation between the level of ErbB2 overexpression (r = 0.91, p < 0.0002) and PY-ErbB2 levels (r = 0.89, p = 0.0005) compared with the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the p52 and p46 Shc isoforms. Consistent with Shc tyrosine phosphorylation being driven by ErbB2, an ErbB2-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor markedly reduced Shc tyrosine phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, although all cell lines had comparable total amounts of p52 and p46 Shc, the amount of an inhibitory Shc isoform, p66, was inversely related to the level of ErbB2 expression (r = -0.86, p = 0.0013). This suggests that reduced p66 Shc expression may play a role in ErbB2-positive breast cancer. In summary, these data are consistent with our prediction that the cellular level of PY-Shc would correlate with the levels of activated ErbB2 displayed by cell lines derived from breast cancers.",

Human clinical data and our in vitro and in vivo studies strongly suggest potent oncogenic cooperation between mutant p53 and Her2 (ErbB2). Yet, the translational significance of mutant p53 in Her2 positive breast cancer, especially with respect to Her2-targeted therapies, has not been evaluated. Our previous work identified novel oncogenic activity of mutant p53 whereby mutp53 amplifies ErbB2 signaling via the mutp53-HSF1-ErbB2 feed-forward loop. Here we report that pharmacological interception of this circuit by ErbB2 inhibitor lapatinib downregulates mutant p53 in vitro and in vivo. We found that ErbB2 inhibition by lapatinib inhibits transcription factor HSF1, and its target Hsp90, followed by mutant p53 degradation in MDM2 dependent manner. Thus, our data suggest that mutant p53 sensitizes cancer cells to lapatinib via two complementary mechanisms: mutant p53 mediated amplification of ErbB2 signaling, and simultaneous annihilation of both potent oncogenic drivers, ErbB2 and mutant p53. Hence, our study could provide valuable information for the optimization of therapeutic protocols to achieve superior clinical effects in the treatment of Her2 positive breast cancer.",

Finding protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPs) that can specifically regulate the function of ErbB should help design novel therapies for treatment. By performing a small interfering RNA screen against 43 human PTPs, we find that knockdown of protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTPN9 significantly increases ErbB2 tyrosyl phosphorylation in the SKBR3 breast cancer cell line. In addition, knockdown of PTPN9 expression also enhances tyrosyl phosphorylation of the ErbB1/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. Conversely, increasing expression of PTPN9 wild type (WT) inhibits tyrosyl phosphorylation of ErbB2 and EGFR. To test whether ErbB2 and EGFR are substrates of PTPN9, PTPN9 WT, and a substrate trapping mutant (PTPN9 DA) are overexpressed in SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Compared with vector control, expression of PTPN9 WT significantly inhibits whereas expression of PTPN9 DA dramatically enhances tyrosyl phosphorylation of ErbB2 and EGFR, respectively. In contrast, expression of PTPN9 WT or DA mutant does not affect tyrosyl phosphorylation of ErbB3 and Shc. Importantly, coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase fusion protein pulldown experiments show that tyrosol-phosphorylated ErbB2 or EGFR is preferentially associated with PTPN9 DA compared with PTPN9 WT, indicating that ErbB2 and EGFR are substrates of PTPN9. Furthermore, PTPN9 WT expression specifically impairs EGF-induced STAT3 and STAT5 activation, and inhibits the cell growth in soft agar. Last, PTPN9 WT expression also reduces invasion and MMP2 expression of MDA-MB-231 cells. Our data suggest PTPN9 as a negative regulator of breast cancer cells by targeting ErbB2 and EGFR and inhibiting STAT activation.",

Here we report that ErbB2 induces invasion and migration of MCF10A cells though up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. We also observed a marked reduction of an epithelial cell marker, E-cadherin, and an induction of vimentin in ErbB2-MCF10A cells, suggesting that epithelial-mesenchymal transition may play a role in the ErbB2-induced invasion and migration of MCF10A cells. Overexpression of ErbB2 significantly activated p38 MAPK and Akt, while Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway was not activated by ErbB2. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we further show that p38 MAPK and Akt signaling pathways are crucial for the ErbB2-induced MMP-9 up-regulation, invasion and migration of MCF10A cells.

The contribution of these truncated forms, specifically those expressed in tumor cell nuclei, to the development of therapeutic resistance to ErbB2 TKIs has not been previously shown. Here, we show that expression of a 95-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated form of ErbB2, herein referred to as p95L (lapatinib-induced p95) was increased in ErbB2(+) breast cancer cells treated with potent ErbB2 TKIs (lapatinib, GW2974). Expressed in tumor cell nuclei, tyrosine phosphorylation of p95L was resistant to inhibition by ErbB2 TKIs. Furthermore, the expression of p95L was increased in ErbB2(+) breast cancer models of acquired therapeutic resistance to lapatinib that mimic the clinical setting. Pretreatment with proteasome inhibitors blocked p95L induction in response to ErbB2 TKIs, implicating the role of the proteasome in the regulation of p95L expression. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylated C-terminal fragments of ErbB2, generated by alternate initiation of translation and similar in molecular weight to p95L, were expressed in tumor cell nuclei, where they too were resistant to inhibition by ErbB2 TKIs. When expressed in the nuclei of lapatinib-sensitive ErbB2(+) breast cancer cells, truncated ErbB2 rendered cells resistant to lapatinib-induced apoptosis.

The screening results were verified by Western blotting to measure HER2 and ER α protein expression. Results. At concentrations that induced little cytotoxicity, thirteen single herbal extracts and five compound recipes were found to increase either ERBB2 or ESR1 luciferase activity.

Overexpression of survivin could abrogate the inhibition of cell growth induced by Herceptin. Herceptin could reduce survivin expression at the transcriptional level. The beta-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) pathway played a very crucial role in this cascade. We found that Herceptin could reduce tyrosine phosphorylation levels of ErbB2 and beta-catenin. Herceptin treatment induced degradation of beta-catenin protein, resulting in reduced binding affinity of beta-catenin/TCF4 to the promoter region of survivin. When we cross-mutated the TCF4 binding sites in the promoter region of survivin, the reduction of survivin promoter activity almost diminished. Taken together, we showed that Herceptin could inhibit survivin expression through the ErbB2-beta-catenin/TCF4-survivin pathway in ErbB2-overexpressed breast cancer cells. This indicates that there may be a new cascade axis from ErbB2 to survivin.",

Cyclin D1 is the regulatory subunit of the holoenzyme that phosphorylates and inactivates the retinoblastoma (pRb) tumor suppressor and is an essential downstream target of ErbB2-induced tumor growth. Herein, we demonstrate that ErbB2 induces the activity of the Notch signaling pathway. ErbB2 induction of DNA synthesis, contact-independent growth, and mammosphere induction required Notch1. ErbB2-induced cyclin D1 and cyclin D1 expression was suficient to induce Notch1 activity, and conversely, genetic deletion of Notch1 in mammary epithelial cells using foxed Notch (Notch(fl/fl)) mice demonstrated that cyclin D1 is induced by Notch1. Genetic deletion of cyclin D1 or small interfering RNA (siRNA) to cyclin D1-reduced Notch1 activity and reintroduction of cyclin D1 into cyclin D1-deficient cells restored Notch1 activity through the inhibition of Numb, an endogenous inhibitor of Notch1 activity. Thus, cyclin D1 functions downstream as a genetic target of Notch1, amplifies Notch1 activity by repressing Numb, and identifies a novel pathway by which ErbB2 induces Notch1 activity via the induction of cyclin D1.",

The efficacy of lapatinib as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, however, is limited by the development of therapeutic resistance that typically occurs within 12 months of starting therapy. In contrast to small molecule inhibitors targeting other receptor tyrosine kinases where resistance has been attributed to mutations within the targeted receptor, ErbB2 mutations have not been commonly found in breast tumors. Instead, acquired resistance to lapatinib seems to be mediated by redundant survival pathways that are activated as a consequence of marked inhibition of ErbB2 kinase activity. For example, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol3 kinase-Akt in lapatinib-treated cells leads to derepression of FOXO3A, a transcription factor that up-regulates estrogen receptor (ER) signaling, resulting in a switch in the regulation of survival factors (e.g., survivin) and cell survival from ErbB2 alone to ER and ErbB2 in resistant cells. In this review, we discuss the effects of lapatinib on signaling networks in ErbB2+ breast cancer cells to elucidate potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and strategies to overcome or prevent its development.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The erbB2 gene is often found amplified and/or overexpressed in breast cancer in which it has clinical relevance as prognostic and predictive factor. It is involved in growth regulation and has a role in the initial phases of cell proliferation, while in vivo and in vitro studies have suggested an involvement also in cell invasion and metastases. It is not clear if these two roles are mutually exclusive and little is known about the mechanisms by which erbB2 may be involved in the control of these processes. Our previous data on patient series suggested that erbB2 might be regulated in different ways depending on the neoplastic status of the cells and that it might be involved in different regulatory pathways. To test this hypothesis we have measured the serum-dependent regulation of erbB2 as a function of the expression of the antimetastatic gene, nm23, in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. The experimental model consisted of three cell lines having different proliferative and invasive potentials: a non-metastatic estrogen receptor (ER) positive cell line, MCF-7; a highly metastatic ER negative cell line, MDA-MB435; and the MDA-MB435 cell line transfected with the nm23-H1 antimetastatic gene (clone H1-177) which has lost the ability to invade and metastasize. We first analysed the serum concentration dependence of invasion and proliferation after 3-4 days of serum deprivation confirming the proliferative and invasive potential of the three cell lines. Modulation of erbB2 expression by different concentrations of serum was then studied. ErbB2 expression in MCF-7 cells showed a complex pattern due to serum modulation, whereas, it was not longer regulated by serum in the MDA-MB435 cell line. In H1-177 cells the erbB2 response to serum was restored and it was very similar to that observed in MCF-7. These data showed a tight association between nm23 and the regulation of erbB2 expression by serum factors suggesting that the role of erbB2 in invasion might be dependent on nm23 expression.",

The amplification/overexpression occurs in 25 to 30% of all breast cancers. In breast cancer, aneusomy of chromosome 17, either monosomy or polysomy, is frequently observed by conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The aim of this study was to discover whether or not numerical aberrations on chromosome 17 have a correlation to the amplification or overexpression of the ERBB2 gene and to analyze their clinical implications in subgroups showing 2+ or 3+ positive scores by immunohistochemistry (IHC).;We used FISH on a series of 175 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast carcinomas to detect ERBB2 amplification, using a dual-probe system for the simultaneous enumeration of the ERBB2 gene and the centromeric region of chromosome 17, as well as using IHC to detect overexpression. We analyzed clinical and pathological variables in a subgroup of patients with 2+ and 3+ IHC scores (147 patients), to describe any differences in clinicopathological characteristics between polysomic and non-polysomic cases with the use of the chi2 test.;We found 13% of cases presenting polysomy, and three cases presented monosomy 17 (2%). According to the status of the ERBB2 gene, instances of polysomy 17 were more frequently observed in non-amplified cases than in FISH-amplified cases, suggesting that the mechanism for ERBB2 amplification is independent of polysomy 17. Polysomy 17 was detected in patients with 2+ and 3+ IHC scores. We found that nodal involvement was more frequent in polysomic than in non-polysomic cases (P = 0.046).;The determination of the copy number of chromosome 17 should be incorporated into the assesment of ERBB2 status.

However, systematic surveys of copy number and expression levels of all genes within the 17q12 region have not been performed. Here, we used cDNA and comparative genomic hybridization microarray technologies to undertake a broad survey of genes involved in the 17q12 amplification in breast cancer. A chromosomal region-specific cDNA microarray containing 217 expressed sequence tag (EST) clones from 17q12 was constructed and used for parallel analysis of gene copy numbers and expression levels in seven breast cancer cell lines allowing direct identification of genes whose expression is elevated because of an increase in copy number in this chromosomal region. The copy number and expression survey identified 12 transcripts that showed a consistent pattern of increased copy number and expression in three or more of the 17q12-amplified cell lines. As expected, these included ERBB2 as well as the GRB7 and MLN64 genes previously shown to be coamplified with ERBB2. In addition, five other known genes and four uncharacterized ESTs were also found to be consistently activated by amplification in these breast cancer cell lines. Amplicon mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed a minimal common region of amplification containing four highly expressed genes, ERBB2, GRB7, MLN64, and an uncharacterized EST 48582. Furthermore, several other genes, although not located in the minimal common region of amplification, showed a correlated pattern of amplification and expression indicating that they might play a role in breast cancers with the 17q12 amplification. In conclusion, parallel analysis of gene copy number and expression levels by cDNA microarray can be used to directly identify candidate target genes involved in amplifications. Our results show that the 17q12 amplification in breast cancer leads to the simultaneous elevation of expression levels of several genes.",

Given the heterogeneous nature of this tumor, a rational use of ATRA and derivatives (retinoids) in the clinic requires the identification of patients that would benefit from retinoid-based protocols. Here, we demonstrate that 23-32% of the human ERBB2(+) breast cancers show coamplification of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA), encoding the retinoic acid receptor, RARα. This represents a novel subtype of breast cancer characterized by remarkable sensitivity to ATRA and RARα agonists, regardless of positivity to the estrogen receptor, a known modulator of retinoid sensitivity. In estrogen-receptor-negative cellular models showing coamplification of ERBB2 and RARA, simultaneous targeting of the corresponding gene products with combinations of lapatinib and ATRA causes synergistic growth inhibition, cyto-differentiation and apoptosis. This provides proof-of-principle that coamplification of ERBB2 and RARA can be exploited for the stratified and targeted therapy of a novel subtype of breast cancer patients, with an approach characterized by tumor cell selectivity and low predicted toxicity. The available cellular models were exploited to define the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor activity of combinations between lapatinib and ATRA. Global gene expression and functional approaches provide evidence for three components of the antiproliferative/apoptotic responses triggered by lapatinib+ATRA. Induction of the retinoid-dependent RARRES3 protein by ATRA stabilizes the effect of lapatinib inhibiting ERBB2 phosphorylation. Upregulation and activation of the transcription factor FOXO3A integrates ATRA-dependent transcriptional and lapatinib-dependent posttranscriptional signals, controlling the levels of effector proteins like the antiapoptotic factor, BIRC5. Stimulation of the TGFβ pathway by ATRA mediates other components of the apoptotic process set in motion by simultaneous targeting of ERBB2 and RARα.",

Promoter footprinting with nuclear extracts reveals an intense Ets hypersensitivity site at the EBS whose degree of intensity correlates with the level of cellular ErbB2 expression.

Mutations preventing Hr-DNA formation can enhance erbB2 promoter activity in human breast cancer cells, a result consistent with previous demonstration that Ets-erbB2 promoter complexes cannot form when the mirror-repeat is engaged in triplex binding, and new results suggesting that Ets binding induces severe promoter bending that may restrict local triplex formation.

The expression levels were compared to the expression of ERBB2 in breast cancers with or without ERBB2 gene amplification. Of 126 prostate tumors, chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) revealed only 1 case containing borderline (six to eight copies) amplifications of ERBB2. This hormone-refractory tumor, however, did not express ERBB2 protein. Immunohistochemical staining of ERBB2 protein was negative (0 or 1+ intensity) in all prostate samples (n = 124) analyzed. To quantitate the level of ERBB2 mRNA expression in prostate tumors (n = 34) and cell lines (n = 3), as well as in breast tumors (n = 30) and cell lines (n = 16), real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (LightCycler) methodology was used. The expression level was similar in all prostate tumor types and corresponded to the level of expression in breast carcinomas without ERBB2 amplification. Breast tumors with ERBB2 amplification expressed, on average, approximately 20 times (P < 0.001) higher mRNA levels than prostate tumors or breast carcinomas without the gene amplification.

The PI3 kinase pathway inhibitors LY294002 and rapamycin inhibited the colony forming ability of all of the lines with the ErbB2 overexpressing lines having a higher sensitivity. A similar trend was observed for inhibition of invasion by LY294002. Rapamycin alone and additively together with herceptin inhibited the breast cancer cell growth especially in ErbB2 overexpressing cells. Rapamycin and herceptin synergistically inhibited tumor growth and endpoint tumor load in a xenograft model using a MCF-7 subline and in a MMTV-ErbB2 transgenic model. Rapamycin and herceptin significantly reduced the level of cyclin D1 and D3 and increased the cleavage of caspase 3 suggesting an increased apoptosis. Our results suggest that rapamycin together with herceptin has an enhanced anti-cancer effect and could be developed as an improved therapeutic regimen for breast cancer.",

The deregulated Src protein synthesis and stability in mediating malignant phenotypes of cancer cells, however, have been neglected. While investigating the signal transduction pathways contributing to ErbB2-mediated metastasis, we found that ErbB2-activated breast cancer cells that had higher metastatic potentials also had increased Src activity compared with ErbB2 low-expressing cells. The increased Src activity in ErbB2-activated cells paralleled higher Src protein levels, whereas Src RNA levels were not significantly altered. Our studies revealed two novel mechanisms that are involved in Src protein up-regulation and activation by ErbB2: (a) ErbB2 increased Src translation through activation of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin/4E-BP1 pathway and (b) ErbB2 increased Src stability most likely through the inhibition of the calpain protease. Furthermore, inhibition of Src activity by a Src-specific inhibitor, PP2, or a Src dominant-negative mutant dramatically reduced ErbB2-mediated cancer cell invasion in vitro and metastasis in an experimental metastasis animal model. Together, activation of ErbB2 and downstream signaling pathways can lead to increased Src protein synthesis and decreased Src protein degradation resulting in Src up-regulation and activation, which play critical roles in ErbB2-mediated breast cancer invasion and metastasis.",

These mutations may have an impact on the clinical responses achieved with lapatinib in breast cancer and may also have a potential impact on the use of lapatinib in other solid cancers. However, the sensitivity of lapatinib towards clinically observed ERBB2 mutations is not known.;We cloned a panel of 8 clinically observed ERBB2 mutations, established stable cell lines and characterized their sensitivity towards lapatinib and alternative ERBB2 inhibitors. Both lapatinib-sensitive and lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutations were observed. Interestingly, we were able to generate lapatinib resistance mutations in wt-ERBB2 cells incubated with lapatinib for prolonged periods of time. This indicates that these resistance mutations may also cause secondary resistance in lapatinib-treated patients. Lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutations were found to be highly resistant towards AEE788 treatment but remained sensitive towards the dual irreversible inhibitors CL-387785 and WZ-4002.;Patients harbouring certain ERBB2 kinase domain mutations at diagnosis may not benefit from lapatinib treatment. Moreover, secondary lapatinib resistance may develop due to kinase domain mutations.

We implicate the paired box 2 gene product (PAX2), in a previously unrecognized role, as a crucial mediator of ER repression of ERBB2 by the anti-cancer drug tamoxifen. We show that PAX2 and the ER co-activator AIB-1/SRC-3 compete for binding and regulation of ERBB2 transcription, the outcome of which determines tamoxifen response in breast cancer cells. The repression of ERBB2 by ER-PAX2 links these two breast cancer subtypes and suggests that aggressive ERBB2-positive tumours can originate from ER-positive luminal tumours by circumventing this repressive mechanism.

Here, we performed a detailed characterization of the molecular events occurring at the ERBB2 amplicon in primary breast tumors. Analysis of the amplicon structure in 330 breast tumors by fluorescence in situ hybridization to a tissue microarray revealed a 280-kb common region of amplification that contains 10 transcribed sequences, including eight known genes.

A highly significant association between amplification and expression levels was observed for six of these genes, including ERBB2 and two uncharacterized hypothetical proteins, MGC9753 and MGC14832.

Cellular models that exhibit ErbB2 kinase dependency and can induce metastatic breast cancer in immune competent hosts are likely to help bridge this gap.;Here, we derived and characterized a cell line model obtained from a transgenic ErbB2/Neu-driven mouse mammary adenocarcinoma.;The MPPS1 cell line produces metastatic breast cancers when implanted in the mammary fat pads of immune-compromised as well as syngeneic immune-competent hosts. MPPS1 cells maintain high ErbB2 overexpression when propagated in DFCI-1 or related media, and their growth is ErbB2-dependent, as demonstrated by concentration-dependent inhibition of proliferation with the ErbB kinase inhibitor Lapatinib. When grown in 3-dimensional (3-D) culture on Matrigel, MPPS1 cells predominantly form large irregular cystic and solid structures. Remarkably, low concentrations of Lapatinib led to a switch to regular acinar growth on Matrigel. Immunofluorescence staining of control vs. Lapatinib-treated acini for markers of epithelial polarity revealed that inhibition of ErbB2 signaling led to rapid resumption of normal mammary epithelium-like cell polarity.;The strict dependence of the MPPS1 cell system on ErbB2 signals for proliferation and alterations in cell polarity should allow its use to dissect ErbB2 kinase-dependent signaling pathways that promote loss of cell polarity, a key component of the epithelial mesenchymal transition and aggressiveness of ErbB2-driven breast cancers.",

According to recent recommendations (\"ASCO/CAP Guidelines\" and German S3 guidelines for breast cancer) the choice of primary test procedure--IHC or ISH - is left to the individual institution. Both techniques are of equal predictive value provided that strict quality precautions have been taken: internal test validation by comparing IHC and (F)ISH, carrying out controls, and annual participation in round-robin tests. Equivocal IHC (score 2+) has to be checked by ISH for amplification. Borderline ISH (ratio 1.8-2.2 or gene copy number 4.0-6.0) should be retested by counting additional cells or performing IHC. In approximately 5% of cases these criteria give conflicting results and the gene copy number alone generates over 90% of the equivocal ISH cases, mostly due to chromosome 17 polysomy.

To inform clinical studies evaluating UPS inhibitors as breast cancer therapeutics, seven phenotypically diverse human breast cancer cell line models were characterized for their cellular and molecular responses to the clinically approved 20S inhibitor bortezomib (PS341; Velcade), focusing on those overexpressing estrogen receptor (ER) or ERBB2/HER2, because these oncogenic receptor pathways are constitutively activated in approximately 80% of all breast cancers. All models demonstrated dose-dependent bortezomib reduction in intracellular 20S activity correlating with cell growth inhibition, and bortezomib IC(50) values (concentrations producing 50% growth inhibition) varied directly with pretreatment 20S activities (r = 0.74; *, p < 0.05), suggesting that basal 20S activity may serve as a clinical predictor of tumor responsiveness to UPS inhibition. Reduction in 20S activity (> 60%) was associated with early (24 h) intracellular relocalization of ER (nucleus to cytoplasm) and ERBB2 (plasma membrane to perinuclear lysosomes), buildup of ubiquitinated and Hsp70-associated receptor, degradation and loss of ER and ERBB2 function, and induction of cellular apoptosis. These models were also used to screen a pharmacologic panel of pathway-targeted anticancer agents [4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-(benzothiazolylthiomethyl)benzylidenecyanoacetamide (AG825), 6-(4-bromo-2-chloro-phenylamino)-7-fluoro-3-methyl-3H-benzoimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-amide (AZD6244/ARRY142886), 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one hydrochloride (LY294002), 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxy geldanamycin (17AAG), and (2E)-N-hydroxy-3-[4-[[(2-hydroxyethyl)[2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]methyl]phenyl]-2-propenamide (LAQ824)] for those capable of sensitizing to bortezomib. In keeping with the observation that 20S reduction has little effect on mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) signaling in either ER-positive or ERBB2-positive models, only the MEK-1/2 inhibitor AZD6244 consistently improved the antitumor activity of bortezomib.",

Here we show that integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulates Ras activity especially in serum-depleted condition. Down-regulation of beta(4) integrin by beta(4) short hairpin RNA (shRNA) decreased Ras activity and carcinoma invasion whereas reexpression of this integrin restored Ras activity. ErbB2, a binding partner of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and EGFR modulated Ras activity, and integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulated phospho-EGFR level without affecting EGFR expression. We also found that integrin alpha(6)beta(4) is involved in ErbB2 expression. Depletion of beta(4) by shRNA reduced ErbB2 protein level without affecting ErbB2 mRNA level and reexpression of beta(4) increased ErbB2 protein level. Reduction of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E, a rate-limiting factor for cap-dependent translation, decreased ErbB2 protein level, and beta(4) shRNA cells exhibited a shift in ErbB2 mRNA to light polysomes compared with control cells. These results show that integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulates ErbB2 through translational control. In summary, we propose a novel mechanism for ErbB2 up-regulation and Ras activation in serum-depleted breast cancer cells; integrin alpha(6)beta(4) regulates the expression of ErbB2 and the subsequent phosphorylation of EGFR and activation of Ras. These findings provide a mechanism that substantiates the reported role of alpha(6)beta(4) in carcinoma invasion.",

Our studies were designed to evaluate the effect of ERBB inhibition on tumor cell motility and intravasation in vivo using clinically relevant small-molecule inhibitors.;Using in vivo mouse models of breast cancer, we test the effects of ERBB1 and ERBB2 inhibitors AC480 and lapatinib, ERBB1 inhibitor gefitinib, and ERBB2 inhibitor AG825 on in vivo tumor cell invasive properties in mammary fat pad tumors.;ERBB1 and ERBB2 inhibition rapidly (within 3 h) inhibits both tumor cell motility and intravasation.

In addition, we differentiate for the first time the contributions of ERBB1 and ERBB2 to the key metastatic properties of in vivo tumor cell invasion and intravasation.

A 28-bp GGA repeat sequence (Pu28-mer) in the nuclease hypersensitive site of the ERBB2 promoter region may play an important role in the regulation of ERBB2 transcription, possibly involving the formation of a G-quadruplex. In order to investigate this possibility, an affinity MALDI-MS approach was used for in vitro protein capture from nuclear extracts from cultured MCF-7 and BT-474 cancer cells at Pu28-mer and control oligonucleotide-modified surfaces. Captured proteins from MCF-7 cells were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Based on these results, Western blot was then used to interrogate captured proteins from both MCF-7 and the Her-2/neu-positive BT-474 cells. Results support the formation of a G-quadruplex by Pu28-mer, indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy, that selectively captures transcription factors including Ku70, Ku80, PURA, nucleolin, and hnRNP K. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed binding of Ku70, Ku80, PURA, and nucleolin to ERBB2 promoter in the live BT-474 cells. These findings may lead to a better understanding of the role of non-duplex DNA structures in gene regulation and provide a more complete picture of the regulation of ErbB2 expression in breast cancer.

Overexpression of human EGF receptor HER-2 (erbB2) leads to amplified heregulin (HRG) signaling, promoting more aggressive breast cancer that is nonresponsive to estrogen and the antiestrogenic drug tamoxifen. Herstatin (Hst), a secreted HER-2 gene product, binds to the HER-2 receptor ectodomain blocking receptor activation. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of this HER-2 inhibitor on HRG-induced signaling, proliferation, and sensitivity to tamoxifen in breast cancer cells with and without HER-2 overexpression. The expression of Hst in MCF7 cells eliminated HRG signaling through both mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt pathways and prevented HRG-mediated proliferation. The loss in signaling corresponded to downregulation of the HRG receptors, HER-3 and HER-4, whereas HER-2 overexpression strongly stimulated the levels of both HRG receptors. Although Hst blocked HRG signaling in both parental and HER-2 transfected cells, it enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen only in the MCF7 cells that overexpressed HER-2. To evaluate further the efficacy of Hst as an anticancer agent, His-tagged Hst was expressed in transfected insect cells, purified, and added to the breast cancer cells. As in the transfected cells, purified Hst inhibited HER-3 levels and suppressed HRG-induced proliferation of MCF7 and BT474 breast cancer cells. In contrast, the HER-2 monoclonal antibody, herceptin, downregulated HER-2, but not HER-3. These results suggest the potential use of Hst against HRG-mediated growth of breast cancers with high and low levels of HER-2 and against tamoxifen resistance in HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer.",

One of the most interesting targets for the design of anticancer therapeutics is the HER2/ErbB2 receptor which is overexpressed in about 20-25% of breast cancers. Given the poor prognosis of women whose tumors express ErbB2 (HER2) at high levels, accurate determination of the ErbB2 status should be routinely performed in women with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer. Efficacy and safety data of numerous trials led to the approval of the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab as the first ErbB2-targeting therapy in ErbB2-positive breast cancer. However, the majority of patients who achieve an initial response to trastuzumab-based regimens for metastatic disease develop resistance within 1 year. This underlines the need for alternative or additional anti-ErbB2-targeting strategies.",

Correlation between Estrogen and Progesterone Receptor and Her-2/ neu amplification and grade of tumor was calculated.;The expression of Estrogen Receptor, Progesterone Receptor were significantly correlated (p < 0.001). Also, there was a significant negative correlation between expression of hormone receptor and Her-2/neu amplification. The histologic grade of the tumor was significantly correlated to the expression of both Estrogen and Progesterone Receptor.

Here, we investigated the effects of LOXL2 expression in normal mammary epithelial cells to gain insight into how LOXL2 mediates cancer progression.;LOXL2 was expressed in MCF10A normal human mammary epithelial cells. The 3D acinar morphogenesis of these cells was assessed, as well as the ability of the cells to form branching structures on extracellular matrix (ECM)-coated surfaces. Transwell-invasion assays were used to assess the invasive properties of the cells. Clinically relevant inhibitors of ErbB2, lapatinib and Herceptin (traztuzumab), were used to investigate the role of ErbB2 signaling in this model. A retrospective study on a previously published breast cancer patient dataset was carried out by using Disease Specific Genomic Analysis (DSGA) to investigate the correlation of LOXL2 mRNA expression level with metastasis and survival of ErbB2-positive breast cancer patients.;Fluorescence staining of the acini revealed increased proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and disrupted polarity, leading to abnormal lumen formation in response to LOXL2 expression in MCF10A cells. When plated onto ECM, the LOXL2-expressing cells formed branching structures and displayed increased invasion. We noted that LOXL2 induced ErbB2 activation through reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and ErbB2 inhibition by using Herceptin or lapatinib abrogated the effects of LOXL2 on MCF10A cells. Finally, we found LOXL2 expression to be correlated with decreased overall survival and metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients with ErbB2-positive tumors.;These findings suggest that LOXL2 expression in normal epithelial cells can induce abnormal changes that resemble oncogenic transformation and cancer progression, and that these effects are driven by LOXL2-mediated activation of ErbB2.

We also investigated the relative expression of MBP-1 and HDAC1 in IDC and normal breast tissues by immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry.;Transfection experiments and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in SKBr3 cells indicated that MBP-1 negatively regulates the ERBB2 gene by binding to a genomic region between nucleotide -514 and -262 of the proximal promoter; consistent with this, a concomitant recruitment of HDAC1 and loss of acetylated histone H4 was observed. In addition, we found high expression of MBP-1 and HDAC1 in normal tissues and a statistically significant inverse correlation with ErbB2 expression in the paired tumor samples.;Altogether, our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that the ERBB2 gene is a novel MBP-1 target, and immunohistochemistry analysis of primary tumors suggests that the concomitant high expression of MBP-1 and HDAC1 may be considered a diagnostic marker of cancer progression for breast IDC.",

The present study aimed to propose a priority setting model for administration of anti-angiogenic agents in breast cancer via assessment of tumor angiogenesis by the microvessel density (MVD) method and associations with clinicopathological characteristics (including simultaneous mutations of TP53 and HER-2 genes).;Age, axillary lymph nodes status, tumor size, stage and grade, estrogen and progesterone receptors status, HER-2/neu status (by immunohistochemistry and FISH test), TP53 mutation, Ki-67 (for proliferation assay) and CD34 (for angiogenesis assay) were assessed in 111 breast cancer patients. The molecular subtype of each tumor was also determined and correlations of simultaneous mutations of HER-2 and p53 genes with angiogenesis and other clinicopathological characteristics were evaluated.;There were significant associations between simultaneous mutations of HER-2 and p53 genes and all other parameters except tumor size. The degree of angiogenesis in the ERBB2 subtype was greater than the others. Younger patients showed a higher angiogenesis rate rather those older than 50 years.;Our results demonstrated that patients with simultaneous mutations of HER-2 and p53 genes, those with ERBB2 molecular subtype and also younger women (often triple negative) seem more eligible for obtaining anti-angiogenic agents.

Pertuzumab, which binds to ErbB2 near the center of domain II, and trastuzumab, which binds to the juxtamembrane region of ErbB2 domain IV, directly interfere with domain II- and domain IV-mediated heterodimerization contacts, respectively. In this study, we report a novel anti-ErbB2 antibody, 3E10, which binds to an epitope in domain III that appears to be located opposite to the dimerization interfaces in domain II and domain IV of ErbB2. Our data show that the 3E10 antibody inhibits ErbB2 heterodimerization via a mechanism that strikingly differs from trastuzumab and pertuzumab. It could be speculated that the 3E10 antibody may affect ErbB2 heterodimerization by causing major conformational changes of ErbB2. Furthermore, 3E10 provides synergistic inhibition of ErbB2 heterodimerization and signaling in combination with either trastuzumab or pertuzumab. The combination of these three anti-ErbB2 antibodies that have complementary mechanisms of action appears to be an extremely potent ErbB2 heterodimerization blocker. Compared with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, the combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab and 3E10 provides a more potent blockade of ErbB2 signaling. Consistent with this, trastuzumab plus pertuzumab plus 3E10 results in greater in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity in ErbB2-overexpressing breast tumor models, suggesting its potential use for treating ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer.

However, little is known regarding central regulators of the various glutamine metabolic pathways in cancer cells.;The impact of PGC-1α and ERRα on glutamine enzyme expression was assessed in ERBB2+ breast cancer cell lines with quantitative RT-PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting experiments. Glutamine flux was quantified using 13C-labeled glutamine and GC/MS analyses. Functional assays for lipogenesis were performed using 14C-labeled glutamine. The expression of glutamine metabolism genes in breast cancer patients was determined by bioinformatics analyses using The Cancer Genome Atlas.;We show that the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, along with the transcription factor ERRα, is a positive regulator of the expression of glutamine metabolism genes in ERBB2+ breast cancer. Indeed, ERBB2+ breast cancer cells with increased expression of PGC-1α display elevated expression of glutamine metabolism genes. Furthermore, ERBB2+ breast cancer cells with reduced expression of PGC-1α or when treated with C29, a pharmacological inhibitor of ERRα, exhibit diminished expression of glutamine metabolism genes. The biological relevance of the control of glutamine metabolism genes by the PGC-1α/ERRα axis is demonstrated by consequent regulation of glutamine flux through the citric acid cycle. PGC-1α and ERRα regulate both the canonical citric acid cycle (forward) and the reductive carboxylation (reverse) fluxes; the latter can be used to support de novo lipogenesis reactions, most notably in hypoxic conditions. Importantly, murine and human ERBB2+ cells lines display a significant dependence on glutamine availability for their growth. Finally, we show that PGC-1α expression is positively correlated with that of the glutamine pathway in ERBB2+ breast cancer patients, and high expression of this pathway is associated with reduced patient survival.;These data reveal that the PGC-1α/ERRα axis is a central regulator of glutamine metabolism in ERBB2+ breast cancer. This novel regulatory link, as well as the marked reduction in patient survival time associated with increased glutamine pathway gene expression, suggests that targeting glutamine metabolism may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of ERBB2+ breast cancer.",

As such, co-targeting ErbB1 and ErbB2 with lapatinib in combination with hormonal therapy is an attractive approach to enhance the efficacy of either tamoxifen or estrogen deprivation. As demonstrated in the EGF30008 trial, a combined targeted strategy with letrozole and lapatinib significantly increased progression-free survival and clinical benefit rates in patients with metastatic breast cancer that co-expresses ER and ErbB2. Therefore, women who are not in an acutely life-threatening situation should be considered for upfront treatment with hormonal therapy (e.g. aromatase inhibitors) in combination with an anti-ErbB2 therapy.",

We determined whether BCAR4 expression sensitises breast cancer cells to lapatinib, and identifies a subgroup of patients who possibly may benefit from ERBB2-targeted therapies despite having tumours with low ERBB2 expression.;Proliferation assays were applied to determine the effect of BCAR4 expression on lapatinib treatment. Changes in cell signalling were quantified with reverse-phase protein microarrays. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of ERBB2 and BCAR4 was performed in 1418 primary breast cancers. Combined BCAR4 and ERBB2 mRNA levels were evaluated for association with progression-free survival (PFS) in 293 oestrogen receptor-α (ER)-positive patients receiving tamoxifen as first-line monotherapy for recurrent disease.;BCAR4 expression strongly sensitised ZR-75-1 and MCF7 breast cancer cells to the combination of lapatinib and antioestrogens. Lapatinib interfered with phosphorylation of ERBB2 and its downstream mediators AKT, FAK, SHC, STAT5, and STAT6. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that 27.6% of the breast cancers were positive for BCAR4 and 22% expressed also low levels of ERBB2. The clinical significance of combining BCAR4 and ERBB2 mRNA status was underscored by the finding that the group of patients having BCAR4-positive/ERBB2-low-expressing cancers had a shorter PFS on tamoxifen treatment than the BCAR4-negative group.;This study shows that BCAR4 expression identifies a subgroup of ER-positive breast cancer patients without overexpression of ERBB2 who have a poor outcome and might benefit from combined ERBB2-targeted and antioestrogen therapy.",

One reason may be altered expression of genes that might compensate for ERBB2 inhibition. We previously mapped the gene-rich region of chromosome 17 telomeric to ERBB2, and reported considerable variability in the telomeric extent of the ERBB2 amplicon. Here we examined whether the variable amplicon size may be associated with patient response to trastuzumab. In addition, we looked at associations between response and several signaling pathway-related genes unrelated to the ERBB2 amplicon, including AKT3, PTEN, PIK3CA, and PTGS2. In 35 patients with ERBB2-amplified metastatic breast cancer, with 40% overall response to trastuzumab, fluorescence in situ hybridization identified the telomeric extent of the ERBB2 amplicon and the status of the several pathway-related genes. Objective response strongly correlated with the telomeric amplicon size, with 62% of patients with shorter amplicons responding, compared with only 7% of patients with longer amplicons (P = 0.0015). Abnormal copy number of PTGS2 was marginally associated with objective response (P = 0.066), while abnormal copy numbers of two reference loci, 1q25 and the chromosome 10 centromere, were significantly associated with response. Pairwise combinations of copy number status of these loci and ERBB2 amplicon size provided stronger associations and identified a group of patients without responders. These results suggest that patient selection for trastuzumab may be improved by considering ERBB2 amplicon size and genomic status of the 1q25, PTGS2, and centromere 10 loci.",

We investigated the relationship between HER2 and the transcription factor FoxM1 in breast cancer. HER2 and FoxM1 expression levels were compared in breast carcinoma cell lines, paraffin-embedded breast cancer patient samples and at the mRNA level in purified breast epithelial cells. To further examine the relationship between HER2 and FoxM1 expression, we either overexpressed or siRNA-mediated depleted endogenous HER2 in breast cancer cell lines. Additionally, a mammary epithelium-targeted HER2 (neu) transgenic mouse model was also used to assess the effect of HER2 on FoxM1 levels. Furthermore, the effect of the HER2-tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib on FoxM1 in HER2 positive breast cancer cells was investigated. HER2 protein levels directly correlated with FoxM1 expression in both breast carcinoma cell lines and paraffin-embedded breast cancer patient samples. Moreover, in purified breast epithelial cells, overexpression of HER2 was associated with high levels of FoxM1 mRNA, suggesting that the upregulation of FoxM1 expression is at least partially mediated transcriptionally. Furthermore, overexpression or ablation of endogenous HER2 resulted in parallel changes in FoxM1 expression. Critically, mammary epithelium-targeted HER2 mouse tumours also resulted in increased FoxM1 expression, suggesting that HER2 directed FoxM1 expression occurs in vivo and may be a critical downstream effector of HER2-targeting therapies. Indeed, treatment of breast cancer cells with lapatinib reduced FoxM1 expression at protein, mRNA and gene promoter levels. Moreover, analysis of normal and breast cancer patient samples revealed that elevated FoxM1 expression at protein and mRNA levels correlated with breast cancer development, but not significantly with cancer progression and survival. Our results indicate that the HER2 receptor regulates the expression of the FoxM1 transcription factor, which has a role in breast cancer development.",

A recent study reported that approximately 30% of tumor biopsies from ovarian cancer patients exhibited erbB2 amplification and overexpression and suggested that the overexpression of this oncogene is an indicator of bad prognosis in ovarian cancer. The purpose of our studies was to investigate amplification of the erbB2 gene, the levels of erbB2 m-RNA and the erbB2 product (p185) in ovarian cancer, and the correlation between these findings and the pathological and clinical features.;Amplification of the erbB2 gene was investigated by Southern blot analysis in 75 samples from 62 patients; mRNA levels were evaluated by Northern blot analysis in 58 samples from 48 patients; and p185 was determined by immunohistochemistry in 65 samples from 65 patients. The erbB2 gene was amplified in only one case (1.6%), and a marked increase in erbB2 mRNA was found only in the same case. Staining for p185 was positive in 12 cases (18.5%). The staining was always confined to the cytoplasm except in the case that showed amplification of erbB2 in which p185 was localized in the membrane. No correlation was found between p185 positivity and pathological and clinical features or response to chemotherapy. Western blot analysis showed that the molecular weight of p185 in positive ovarian cancer cells was approximately 10 KDa lower than in breast cancer.;In contrast to breast cancer, in ovarian cancer the amplification of erbB2 appears infrequent. The levels of p185 detected by immunohistochemistry were not related to the amplification of the gene or to the increase in mRNA, suggesting the possibility of a longer half-life of the protein in the positive cases. The finding that erbB2 product in ovarian cancer is mostly localised in cytoplasm and not in the membrane as in breast cancer and that it has a lower molecular weight than the p185 in breast cancer suggest that this oncogene plays a different biological role in these two neoplasms.",

This article reviews typical treatments based on stage, histology, and biomarkers. Lobular carcinoma in situ does not require treatment. Ductal carcinoma in situ can progress to invasive cancer and is treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy without further lymph node exploration or systemic therapy. Stages I and II breast cancers are usually treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy. Radiation therapy following breast-conserving surgery decreases mortality and recurrence. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered for most breast cancers with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes, and it does not have the adverse effects of arm swelling and pain that are associated with axillary lymph node dissection. Choice of adjuvant systemic therapy depends on lymph node involvement, hormone receptor status, ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu) overexpression, and patient age and menopausal status. In general, node-positive breast cancer is treated systemically with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy (for hormone receptor-positive cancer), and trastuzumab (for cancer overexpressing ERBB2). Anthracycline- and taxane-containing chemotherapeutic regimens are active against breast cancer. Stage III breast cancer typically requires induction chemotherapy to downsize the tumor to facilitate breast-conserving surgery. Inflammatory breast cancer, although considered stage III, is aggressive and requires induction chemotherapy followed by mastectomy, rather than breastconserving surgery, as well as axillary lymph node dissection and chest wall radiation. Prognosis is poor in women with recurrent or metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer, and treatment options must balance benefits in length of life and reduced pain against harms from treatment.",

Characterization of H2NTF shows that it is devoid of the tyrosine kinase domain but it readily interacts with full-length HER2 and other HER receptors. As a consequence, H2NTF acts as a dominant-negative, attenuating the signaling triggered by full-length HER receptors. Expression of H2NTF results in resistance to the treatment with low concentrations of trastuzumab in vitro.

In this communication, we showed that several breast cancer cell lines including BT20, BT474, MCF-7, MDA-MB-453, and SKBR-3 cells had a similar pattern of resistance to a broad range of anti-cancer drugs including 5-Fluorouracil, Cytoxan, Doxorubincin, Taxol, and Vinorelbin, suggesting a mechanism of multidrug resistance. High expression of P-glycoprotein and the ErbB receptors contribute to drug resistance of these breast cancer cells; however, overexpression of ErbB2 alone is not a major factor in determining drug resistance. To further determine the role of the ErbB receptors in drug resistance, we selected various NIH 3T3 cell lines that specifically expressed EGF receptor (EGFR), ErbB2, ErbB3, EGFR/ErbB2, EGFR/ErbB3, or ErbB2/ErbB3. A cytotoxicity assay showed that expression of ErbB2 alone did not significantly enhance drug resistance, whereas coexpression of either EGFR or ErbB3 with ErbB2 significantly enhanced drug resistance. Moreover, ErbB2 was highly phosphorylated in NIH 3T3 cells that coexpress ErbB2 with either EGFR or ErbB3, but not in NIH 3T3 cells that express ErbB2 alone. Together, our results suggest that coexpression of EGFR or ErbB3 with ErbB2 induces high phosphorylation of ErbB2 and renders the cells more resistant to various anti-cancer drugs.",

Activation of ErbB2 via homodimerization in a non-transformed human mammary epithelial cell line, MCF-10A, in basement membrane cultures leads to formation of proliferative structures that share properties with non-invasive early stage lesions. Recently, we have shown that activation of ErbB2 homodimers combined with expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta induces invasive and migratory activity in MCF-10A cells. In this system, migration requires inputs from numerous cellular pathways. We discuss this data and a model for migration induced by ErbB2 and TGF-beta. Concurrent studies by other groups have also shown that ErbB2 and TGF-beta can cooperate to increase metastatic and invasive behavior in murine mammary tumors.

This review will focus on the signal transduction through this protein, and explains how the overexpression of erbB2 may result in poor prognosis of breast cancer, and finally it will summerize our current understanding about the therapeutic potential of receptor-targeted therapy in breast cancer. ErbB2 does not have any known ligand which is able to bind to it with high affinity. However the kinase activity of erbB2 can be activated without any ligand, if it is overexpressed, and by heteroassociation with other members of the erbB family (erbB1 or epidermal growth factor receptor, erbB3 and erbB4). This interaction substantially increases the efficiency and diversity of signal transduction through these receptor complexes. In addition, erbB2 forms large scale receptor clusters containing hundreds of proteins. These receptor islands may take part in recruiting cytosolic factors which relay the signal towards the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Overexpression of erbB2 was linked to higher transforming activity, increased metastatic potential, angiogenesis and drug resistence of breast tumor in laboratory experiments. As a corollary of these properties, erbB2 amplification is generally thought to be associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. These early findings lead to the development of antibodies that down-regulate erbB2. Such a therapeutic approach has already been found effective in experimental tumor models and in clinical trials as well. Further understanding of the importance of erbB2 and growth factor receptors in the transformation of normal cells to malignant ones may once give us a chance to cure erbB2 over-expressing breast cancer.",

Interactions were studied using mammary/breast cancer cell lines from wild-type rat c-neu gene transgenic mice and humans. Estradiol promoted cell proliferation and activated erbB2/neu tyrosine kinase, Akt, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling exclusively in mammary and breast epithelial cell lines with coexpression of both erbB2 and erbB3. Estradiol action was independent of the transgene promoter (MMTV-LTR) activity, both in vitro and in vivo, as well as c-neu transgene or endogenous erbB2 gene expression. Estrogen induction of cell growth promotion, erbB2/neu activation, and downstream signaling was abrogated by blockade of estrogen receptor (ER) with the pure ER antagonist ICI 182,780 or knockdown of erbB3 expression via specific siRNA.

Here we showed decreased motility and migration in miR-125b expressing MCF7 cells, independent of ERBB2. MCF7-125b cells demonstrated profoundly decreased cytoplasmic protrusions detected by phalloidin staining of filamentous actin along with decreased motility and migration behaviors detected by in vitro wound closure and transwell migration assays compared to empty vector transfected cells (MCF7-EV). Among possible numerous targets of miR-125b, we showed ARID3B (AT-rich interactive domain 3B) to be a novel target with roles in cell motility in breast cancer cells.

ErbB2 homodimerizes but also presents as a common auxiliary subunit of the EGF and heregulin receptors (erbB1 or EGFR; and erbB3-4, respectively), with which it heteroassociates. ErbB2 is generally regarded as an orphan (ligand-less) receptor with a very potent kinase domain activated either via its associated partners or constitutively as a consequence of discrete mutations. It follows that the extent and regulation of its cell surface interactions are of central importance. We have studied the large-scale association pattern of erbB2 in quiescent and activated cells labeled with fluorescent anti-erbB2 monoclonal antibodies using scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM). ErbB2 was found to be concentrated in irregular membrane patches with a mean diameter of approx. 0.5 microm in nonactivated SKBR3 and MDA453 human breast tumor cells. The average number of erbB2 proteins in a single cluster on nonactivated SKBR3 cells was about 10(3). Activation of SKBR3 cells with EGF, heregulin as well as a partially agonistic anti-erbB2 monoclonal antibody led to an increase in the mean cluster diameter to 0.6-0.9 microm, irrespective of the ligand. The EGF-induced increase in the erbB2 cluster size was inhibited by the EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD153035. The average size of erbB2 clusters on the erbB2-transfected line of CHO cells (CB2) was similar to that of activated SKBR3 cells, a finding correlated with the increased base-line tyrosine phosphorylation of erbB2 in cells expressing only erbB2. We conclude that an increase in cluster size may constitute a general phenomenon in the activation of erbB2.",

Recently, a positive correlation between HER2 and MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor, a tumor-promoting protein and heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) client) protein levels was shown in cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanistic link remained unknown. Here we show that overexpressed HER2 constitutively activates heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1), the master transcriptional regulator of the inducible proteotoxic stress response of heat-shock chaperones, including HSP90, and a crucial factor in initiation and maintenance of the malignant state. Inhibiting HER2 pharmacologically by Lapatinib (a dual HER2/epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor) or CP724.714 (a specific HER2 inhibitor), or by knockdown via siRNA leads to inhibition of phosphoactivated Ser326 HSF1, and subsequently blocks the activity of the HSP90 chaperone machinery in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer lines. Consequently, HSP90 clients, including MIF, AKT, mutant p53 and HSF1 itself, become destabilized, which in turn inhibits tumor proliferation. Mechanistically, HER2 signals via the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT- mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis to induce activated pSer326 HSF1. Heat-shock stress experiments confirm this functional link between HER2 and HSF1, as HER2 (and PI3K) inhibition attenuate the HSF1-mediated heat-shock response. Importantly, we confirmed this axis in vivo. In the mouse model of HER2-driven breast cancer, ErbB2 inhibition by Lapatinib strongly suppresses tumor progression, and this is associated with inactivation of the HSF1 pathway. Moreover, ErbB2-overexpressing cancer cells derived from a primary mouse ErbB2 tumor also show HSF1 inactivation and HSP90 client destabilization in response to ErbB2 inhibition. Furthermore, in HER2-positive human breast cancers HER2 levels strongly correlate with pSer326 HSF1 activity. Our results show for the first time that HER2/ErbB2 overexpression controls HSF1 activity, with subsequent stabilization of numerous tumor-promoting HSP90 clients such as MIF, AKT and HSF1 itself, thereby causing a robust promotion in tumor growth in HER2-positive breast cancer.

This was based on several lines of evidence. First, the S1P stimulation of ERK-1/2 was abolished by JTE013, which we show here is an S1P(2/4) antagonist and reduced by siRNA knockdown of S1P(4). Second, the S1P-stimulated activation of ERK-1/2 was almost completely abolished by a HER2 inhibitor (ErbB2 inhibitor II) and reduced by siRNA knockdown of HER2 expression. Third, phyto-S1P, which is an S1P(4) agonist, stimulated ERK-1/2 activation in an S1P(4)- and HER2-dependent manner. Fourth, FTY720 phosphate, which is an agonist at S1P(1,3,4,5) but not S1P(2) stimulated activation of ERK-1/2. Fifth, S1P stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2, which was reduced by JTE013. HER2 which is an orphan receptor tyrosine kinase is the preferred dimerization partner of the EGF receptor. However, EGF-stimulated activation of ERK-1/2 was not affected by siRNA knockdown of HER2 or by ErbB2 (epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (or HER2)) inhibitor II in MDA-MB-453 cells. Moreover, S1P-stimulated activation of ERK-1/2 does not require an EGF receptor. Thus, S1P and EGF function in a mutually exclusive manner. In conclusion, the magnitude of the signaling gain on the ERK-1/2 pathway produced in response to S1P can be increased by HER2 in MDA-MB-453 cells.

        "Doc_abstract":"The ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in approximately 30% of breast tumor cases and its overexpression correlates with an unfavorable prognosis. A major contributor for this course of the disease is the insensitivity of these tumors toward chemotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies, inhibiting the ligand-induced activation of the receptor and tyrosine kinase inhibitors acting on the intrinsic enzymatic activity of the intracellular domain, have been developed as targeted drugs. Both have been shown to be beneficial for breast cancer patients. We targeted a third aspect of receptor function: its association with intracellular signaling components. For this purpose, we selected peptide aptamers, which specifically interact with defined domains of the intracellular part of the receptor. The peptide aptamers were selected from a random peptide library using a yeast two-hybrid system with the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of ErbB2 as a bait construct. The peptide aptamer AII-7 interacts with high specificity with the ErbB2 receptor in vitro and in vivo. The aptamers colocalized with the intracellular domain of ErbB2 within cells. We investigated the functional consequences of the aptamer interaction with the ErbB2 receptor within tumor cells. The aptamer sequences were either expressed intracellularly or introduced into the cells as recombinant aptamer proteins. The phosphorylation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase was nearly unaffected and the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 was only modestly reduced. In contrast, they strongly inhibited the induction of AKT kinase in MCF7 breast cancer cells treated with heregulin, whereas AKT activation downstream of insulin-like growth factor I or epidermal growth factor receptor was not or only slightly affected. High AKT activity is responsible for the enhanced resistance of ErbB2-overexpressing cancer cells toward chemotherapeutic agents. Peptide aptamer interference with AKT activation resulted in the restoration of regular sensitivity of breast cancer cells toward Taxol.",

Using a computational pathway-based approach, we interrogated clinical breast cancer genomic data sets for candidate non-oncogenic vulnerabilities in breast cancers that have genomic amplification of ERBB2, which encodes human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2). HER2-positive (HER2(+)) breast cancers showed increased expression of genes encoding proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of ERAD led to irrecoverable ER stress and selectively killed HER2(+) breast cancer cells. Cell death caused by ERAD inhibition partially depended on increased HER2-mTOR signaling, which imposed an increased proteotoxic burden on the ER. Cell death in response to ER stress required the IRE1α-JNK pathway, which was selectively suppressed in HER2(+) breast cancers by phosphatases that inactivate JNK. Accordingly, the cytotoxicity of inhibiting ERAD as well as JNK phosphatases was synergistic in HER2(+) but not in HER2-negative breast cancer cells. Therefore, our study suggests that reactivation of oncogene-induced stress by targeting stress-adaptive pathways may be a beneficial approach for therapy-resistant breast cancers.",

ERBB2 gene copy numbers and RNA transcripts were measured by Southern and Northern blot analysis in all samples. The BT-474 and MCF7 cell lines were processed in the same way as the tissue samples and used a s references of activation or the normal state of the ERBB2 gene, respectively. Complete concordance between immunohistochemistry and molecular biology was observed in 43/58 cases (74 per cent). However, fixation and processing protocols significantly affected the reactivity of the antigenic determinants. The most consistent results were obtained with NCLCB11 on frozen sections and with Tab250 on paraffin-embedded sections. For prospective studies, the use of alcoholic formalin in association with a highly specific antibody (Tab250, 9G6, NCLCB11, or OA-11-854) gave the best results. Methacarn appears to be a reliable fixative, but was studied in only 28 cases. For retrospective studies, the most important parameter to take into account is the sensitivity of the antibody. Thus, with Bouin's fixation, 3B5 was the only reliable antibody, whereas with buffered formalin, Tab250 gave the most consistent results.

Two models have emerged that account for the high surface distribution of ErbB2. In one model, the surface pool is dynamic and governed by a balance between endocytosis and recycling, whereas in the other it is retained, static, and excluded from endocytosis. These models have contrasting implications for how ErbB2 exerts its biological function and how cancer therapies might down-regulate surface ErbB2, such as the antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) or the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. Little is known, however, about how these treatments affect ErbB2 endocytic trafficking. To investigate this issue, we examined breast carcinoma cells by immunofluorescence and quantitative immunoelectron microscopy and developed imaging and trafficking kinetics assays using cell surface fluorescence quenching. Surprisingly, trastuzumab does not influence ErbB2 distribution but instead recycles passively with internalized ErbB2. By contrast, geldanamycin down-regulates surface ErbB2 through improved degradative sorting in endosomes exclusively rather than through increased endocytosis. These results reveal substantial dynamism in the surface ErbB2 pool and clearly demonstrate the significance of endosomal sorting in the maintenance of ErbB2 surface distribution, a critical feature of its biological function.",

Although a previous study demonstrated a prognostic concordance among gene expression signatures, it was limited to only one dataset and did not fully elucidate how the different genes were related to one another nor did it examine the contribution of well-known biological processes of breast cancer tumorigenesis to their prognostic performance.;To address the above issues and to further validate these initial findings, we performed the largest meta-analysis of publicly available breast cancer gene expression and clinical data, which are comprised of 2,833 breast tumors. Gene coexpression modules of three key biological processes in breast cancer (namely, proliferation, estrogen receptor [ER], and HER2 signaling) were used to dissect the role of constituent genes of nine prognostic signatures.;Using a meta-analytical approach, we consolidated the signatures associated with ER signaling, ERBB2 amplification, and proliferation. Previously published expression-based nomenclature of breast cancer 'intrinsic' subtypes can be mapped to the three modules, namely, the ER-/HER2- (basal-like), the HER2+ (HER2-like), and the low- and high-proliferation ER+/HER2- subtypes (luminal A and B). We showed that all nine prognostic signatures exhibited a similar prognostic performance in the entire dataset. Their prognostic abilities are due mostly to the detection of proliferation activity. Although ER- status (basal-like) and ERBB2+ expression status correspond to bad outcome, they seem to act through elevated expression of proliferation genes and thus contain only indirect information about prognosis. Clinical variables measuring the extent of tumor progression, such as tumor size and nodal status, still add independent prognostic information to proliferation genes.;This meta-analysis unifies various results of previous gene expression studies in breast cancer. It reveals connections between traditional prognostic factors, expression-based subtyping, and prognostic signatures, highlighting the important role of proliferation in breast cancer prognosis.",

Amplification of ErbB2, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is found in 20-30% of breast cancer patients. Ethanol preferably stimulates invasion by breast cancer cells over-expressing ErbB2 in vitro. Over-expression of ErbB2 is positively associated with elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. Ethanol at physiologically relevant concentrations activates MMP-2 without altering its expression level in mammary epithelial cells over-expressing ErbB2, but not in cells expressing low levels of ErbB2. The activation is dependent on c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and reactive oxygen species. Selective inhibitors of MMP-2 and anti-oxidants significantly inhibit ethanol-stimulated cell invasion. Similarly, knocking down MMP-2 by small interference RNA induces a partial blockage on ethanol-promoted cell invasion. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 is predominantly expressed in stromal fibroblasts; ethanol also activates fibroblastic MMP-2. The conditioned medium collected from ethanol-exposed fibroblasts dramatically stimulates the invasion of breast cancer cells. The role of MMP-2 in ethanol-induced tumor promotion is discussed.",

Conversely, down-regulation of ErbB2 inhibits AKT activation. Here, we identify PP1 as a serine/threonine phosphatase that associates with and dephosphorylates AKT in breast cancer cells, and we show that ErbB2 inhibits PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of AKT. Inhibition of ErbB2 by either the HSP (heat shock protein) 90 inhibitor geldanamycin or the ErbB inhibitor ZD1839 in SKBR3 cells, a human breast cancer cell line overexpressing ErbB2 protein, induces a rapid and dramatic decrease in AKT activity. Decreased AKT activity occurs many hours before the HSP90-dependent decline of AKT protein but is correlated with loss of AKT phosphorylation. Decreased AKT phosphorylation is not due to blockade of AKT activation or to preferential HSP90-mediated degradation of phosphorylated AKT. Instead, it is caused by increased AKT dephosphorylation. Sensitivity to a panel of phosphatase inhibitors suggests involvement of the phosphatase PP1 in this process. In vitro phosphatase assay (using PP1 immunoprecipitated from COS7 cells transiently transfected with the wild-type protein, as well as purified PP1) confirmed that AKT is a substrate of PP1. Furthermore, endogenous PP1 and AKT associate with each other in SKBR3. However, the phosphatase is phosphorylated and its activity is suppressed (determined by in vitro assay). In contrast, ErbB2 inhibition abrogates PP1 phosphorylation and restores its activity (measured by its ability to dephosphorylate AKT in vitro). Finally, transient overexpression of constitutively active PP1 in SKBR3 cells promotes marked dephosphorylation of endogenous AKT protein. These data indicate that ErbB2 acts to preserve the phosphorylation, and hence to prolong the activation, of AKT kinase by repressing the activity of the phosphatase PP1. ErbB2 thus functions to regulate AKT kinase by simultaneously promoting its activation while inhibiting its inactivation.",

Numerical aberrations of chromosome 17 are linked to breast-cancer initiation and progression, and possibly to treatment response. However, the clinical importance of chromosome 17 anomalies, in particular the effect on ERBB2 protein expression, is unknown. Reports are conflicting regarding the association of copy gain of chromosome 17 (polysomy 17) with strong ERBB2 protein expression in the absence of true ERBB2 gene amplification. Copy-number anomalies in chromosome 17 seem to be common in tumours that show discrepant ERBB2 expression and in tumours with discordant ERBB2-protein and ERBB2 gene copy number measurements. The mechanisms of ERBB2 dosage changes-gene amplification versus chromosome gain and loss-probably differ in primary and metastatic disease; however, a correction for chromosome 17 copy-number is necessary to completely distinguish between these mechanisms.

Tumor development was associated with amplification and overexpression of ErbB2 at both the transcript and protein levels. Here we demonstrate that the EGR2/Krox20 transcription factor and its coactivator CITED1 are coordinately upregulated during ErbB2 tumor induction. We have identified an EGR2 binding site in the erbB2 promoter and demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays that EGR2 and CITED1 associate specifically with this region of the promoter. EGR2 and CITED1 were shown to associate, and expression from an erbB2 promoter-reporter construct was stimulated by EGR2 and was further enhanced by CITED1 coexpression. Furthermore, expression of the 14-3-3sigma tumor suppressor led to downregulation of ErbB2 protein levels and relocalization of EGR2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Taken together, these observations suggest that, in addition to an increased gene copy number and upregulation of EGR2 and CITED1, an elevated erbB2 transcript level involves the loss of 14-3-3sigma, which sequesters a key transcriptional regulator of the erbB2 promoter.",

HER-2/neu gene alterations have been the most frequently assessed prognostic factors during the last 10 years in breast cancer and have recently emerged as a management decision tool and a therapeutic target. There is still controversy over the best method to determine whether a tumor is HER-2/neu positive. Because of the increasing demand for HER-2/neu gene status determination in clinical practice, we compared HER-2/neu gene alterations at the DNA level (gene amplification) and the protein level (overexpression) in a panel of patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer who had received local radiotherapy alone, with no adjuvant therapy.;We tested 100 excised lymph node-negative breast tumors, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a biotinylated HER-2/neu DNA probe and immunohistochemical assays (IHC) with 2 different antibodies.;The FISH frequency of HER-2/neu gene amplification was 15%, and the IHC frequency of overexpression was 21%.;Although HER-2/neu amplification by FISH and HER-2/neu overexpression by IHC correlated well in this panel of lymph node-negative breast carcinomas, there were a number of discordant cases, pointing to the important need for determining HER-2/neu alteration for the future management of HER-2/neu-based clinical applications.",

ErbB2 protein is overexpressed in approximately 30% of breast cancers. Although controversies exist, data from our laboratory and from clinical trials of trastuzumab indicate that ErbB2 overexpression confers chemoresistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel. One of the molecular mechanisms of ErbB2-mediated paclitaxel resistance is that overexpression of the ErbB2 receptor leads to deregulation of the G2/M cell cycle check-point that inhibits paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Several promising ErbB2-targeting strategies have now been developed to conquer the adverse consequences of ErbB2 overexpression such as paclitaxel resistance. Among these, trastuzumab has brought great promise. We have recently shown that trastuzumab can effectively sensitize ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells to paclitaxel by reversing the antiapoptotic function of ErbB2. Our studies provide additional support for chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab for ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers, and it may bring insights into designing more effective and specific therapies that could offer great benefits to patients.",

Recent studies have shown an interaction between HER-2 (ERBB2) and cyclin E, but the exact mechanism is unknown. Interestingly, cyclin E over-expression has been associated with trastuzumab resistance. We studied cyclin E over-expression, CCNE1 amplification, and relapse-free survival in HER-2-positive primary breast cancers treated with and without trastuzumab therapy. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 202 HER-2-positive breast carcinomas were studied. Expression levels of cyclin E and proliferation marker Ki-67 were determined using immunohistochemistry. Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) with a gene-specific bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probe was used to analyze presence of CCNE1 amplification. Majority of HER-2-positive breast carcinomas exhibited nuclear staining for cyclin E protein. Cyclin E was highly expressed (≥50 % cells) in 37 % of cases. Incidence of CCNE1 amplification (≥6 gene copies/cell or clusters) was 8 %. Cyclin E amplification and over-expression were strongly associated with each other, grade, hormone receptors, and Ki-67. Neither high cyclin E expression nor CCNE1 amplification was associated with relapse-free survival (RFS) irrespective of short-term (9-week regimen) adjuvant trastuzumab therapy. These results confirm cyclin E and HER-2 gene co-amplification in a fraction of HER-2-positive breast cancers. Cyclin E is frequently over-expressed but appears to have limited value as a prognostic or predictive factor in HER-2-positive breast cancer regardless of trastuzumab therapy. ",

We studied the activity of metformin against diverse molecular subtypes of breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Metformin showed biological activity against all estrogen receptor (ER) positive and negative, erbB2 normal and abnormal breast cancer cell lines tested. It inhibited cellular proliferation, reduced colony formation and caused partial cell cycle arrest at the G(1) checkpoint. Metformin did not induce apoptosis (as measured by DNA fragmentation and PARP cleavage) in luminal A, B or erbB2 subtype breast cancer cell lines. At the molecular level, metformin treatment was associated with a reduction of cyclin D1 and E2F1 expression with no changes in p27(kip1) or p21(waf1). It inhibited mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt activity, as well as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in both ER positive and negative, erbB2-overexpressing and erbB2-normal expressing breast cancer cells. In erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines, metformin reduced erbB2 expression at higher concentrations, and at lower concentrations within the therapeutic range, it inhibited erbB2 tyrosine kinase activity evidenced by a reduction of phosphorylated erbB2 (P-erbB2) at both auto- and Src- phosphorylation sites. These data suggest that metformin may have potential therapeutic utility against ER positive and negative, erbB2-overexpressing and erbB2-normal expressing breast cancer cells.",

Expression of DeltaNErbB2 in MCF-7 cells resulted in sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2, extensive loss of the epithelial morphology, appearance of vesicles and long protrusions as well as pronounced scattering of the cells. Similar alterations were observed upon ErbB2 overexpression but at much lower levels. Employing cell clones with inducible expression of DeltaNErbB2, it was revealed that the morphological changes were fully reversible and depended on continuous expression of DeltaNErbB2 but not on the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. Interestingly, the expression of DeltaNErbB2 resulted also in the increased expression and phosphorylation of ErbB1 as well as in the prolonged ligand-induced activation of the ErbB1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, constitutive signaling upon expression of the truncated ErbB2 receptor in human breast cancer cells promotes morphological changes indicative of a more motile and aggressive phenotype.",

As an attempt to meet the crucial need for identification of the subpopulation of patients that will benefit from more individualized therapies, rapidly evolving therapies should allow a profiling of the tumors and/or of the CTCs. We established a triple fluorescence staining using eight cell lines to visualize the CTCs (cytokeratin detection) and then to define their individual ERα and ErbB2 status. Afterward, we used this method for blood samples from 26 metastatic breast cancer patients. We identified major differences of ERα levels between the cell lines and even within one cell line. For the metastatic patients, we detected and characterized CTCs in 38.5% of the patients with a total of 92 CTCs. We could demonstrate that at least 69.6% of the CTCs exhibit an ERα and/or ErbB2 status different from the status of the primary tumor and that the CTCs from only 30% of the patients had no change of receptor status. Strikingly, heterogeneities of the status, aggregation, and size clearly appear within the CTCs.

Concurrent targeting of ErbB2 stability with HSP90 inhibitors is synergistic with Trastuzumab, suggesting that pharmacological agents that can inhibit HSP90 as well as signaling pathways activated by ErbB2 could be useful against ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers. The triterpene natural product Celastrol inhibits HSP90 and several pathways relevant to ErbB2-dependent oncogenesis including the NFκB pathway and the proteasome, and has shown promising activity in other cancer models. Here, we demonstrate that Celastrol exhibits in vitro antitumor activity against a panel of human breast cancer cell lines with selectivity towards those overexpressing ErbB2.

Mechanistically, Celastrol not only induced the expected ubiquitinylation and degradation of ErbB2 and other HSP90 client proteins, but it also increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

The number of observed interactors for each oncogene showed a significant range, e.g., 4.2% (JAK1) to 27.3% (MYC). The percentage is measured as a fraction of the total protein interactions in a given data set vs total interactors for that oncogene in STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins, version 9.0) and I2D (Interologous Interaction Database, version 1.95). This approach allowed us to focus on 4 main oncogenes, ERBB2, EGFR, MYC, and GRB2, for pathway analysis. We used bioinformatics sites GeneGo, PathwayCommons and NCI receptor signaling networks to identify pathways that contained the four main oncogenes and had good coverage in the transcriptomic and proteomic data sets as well as a significant number of oncogene interactors. The four pathways identified were ERBB signaling, EGFR1 signaling, integrin outside-in signaling, and validated targets of C-MYC transcriptional activation. The greater dynamic range of the RNA-Seq values allowed the use of transcript ratios to correlate observed protein values with the relative levels of the ERBB2 and EGFR transcripts in each of the four pathways. This provided us with potential proteomic signatures for the SUM149 and 190 cell lines, growth factor receptor-bound protein 7 (GRB7), Crk-like protein (CRKL) and Catenin delta-1 (CTNND1) for ERBB signaling; caveolin 1 (CAV1), plectin (PLEC) for EGFR signaling; filamin A (FLNA) and actinin alpha1 (ACTN1) (associated with high levels of EGFR transcript) for integrin signalings; branched chain amino-acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1), carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CAD), nucleolin (NCL) (high levels of EGFR transcript); transferrin receptor (TFRC), metadherin (MTDH) (high levels of ERBB2 transcript) for MYC signaling; S100-A2 protein (S100A2), caveolin 1 (CAV1), Serpin B5 (SERPINB5), stratifin (SFN), PYD and CARD domain containing (PYCARD), and EPH receptor A2 (EPHA2) for PI3K signaling, p53 subpathway.

        "Doc_abstract":"Breast cancer cells that overexpress HER-2/neu are more resistant to chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel (Taxol) and docetaxel (Taxotere) than those that do not overexpress HER-2/neu. In previous work, we showed that the adenovirus type 5 E1A can repress HER-2/neu expression at the transcriptional level. Here we first demonstrated that paclitaxel sensitivity correlates with HER-2/neu expression level in a panel of mouse fibroblasts expressing different levels of HER-2/ neu, and that downregulation of HER-2/neu expression by E1A sensitizes the cells to paclitaxel. To further test whether E1A can sensitize HER-2/neu-overexpressing human breast cancer cells to paclitaxel through E1A-mediated HER-2/neu repression, an adenoviral vector was used to transfer the E1A gene into two human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-361, that overexpress HER-2/neu. After E1A delivery, we observed that HER-2/neu expression level was reduced, and cells were treated with paclitaxel. Cell proliferation assays showed a synergistic growth inhibition effect of E1A and paclitaxel. The synergistic effect was also confirmed by soft agar colony-formation assay. Breast cancer cell lines that express low levels of HER-2/neu, MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 cells showed no synergistic growth inhibition effect when treated on the same protocols. Thus, we concluded that the adenovirus type 5 E1A gene can sensitize paclitaxel-resistant HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells to the drug by repressing HER-2/neu expression. This in turn may have important implications for the development of a novel therapy that combines chemotherapy and gene therapy.",

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that aluminum may trigger genomic instability by interfering with DNA strands. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between aluminum concentrations in the peripheral and central areas of breast tumors with the instability of three key genes in breast cancer, ERBB2, C-MYC, and CCND1 and aneuploidy of the chromosomes harboring these genes. Tissue samples of 118 women treated for breast cancer were obtained. Evaluation of aluminum content was carried out using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. A tissue microarray slide containing the tumor samples was used in FISH assays to assess ERBB2, C-MYC, and CCND1 expressions as well as the statuses of their respective chromosomes 17, 8, and 11. Clinicopathological data were obtained from patient's records. Aluminum levels of >2.0 mg/kg were found in 20.3 and 22.1% of the central and peripheral breast tumor areas, respectively. Amplification and/or aneuploid-positive statuses for ERBB2/CEP17, C-MYC/CEP8, and CCND1/CEP11 were detected in 24, 36.7, and 29.3% of the tumors, respectively. We found that aluminum concentration was not related to these altered gene statuses. Our findings suggest that aluminum concentration does not affect genomic stability in breast tissues. Tissue microenvironment modifications, due to the presence of aluminum compounds, seem more appealing as a possible target for future studies to determine the implications of aluminum in breast carcinogenesis.",

In agreement with a recent study, which reports concurrent allelic BECN1 loss and ERBB2 amplification in a small number of human breast tumors, we found that low BECN1 mRNA correlates with ERBB2-overexpression in breast cancers, suggesting that BECN1 loss and ERBB2 overexpression may functionally interact in mammary tumorigenesis. We now report that ERBB2 overexpression suppressed autophagic response to stress in mouse mammary and human breast cancer cells. ERBB2-overexpressing Becn1(+/+) and Becn1(+/-) immortalized mouse mammary epithelial cells (iMMECs) formed mammary tumors in nude mice with similar kinetics, and monoallelic Becn1 loss did not alter ERBB2- and PyMT-driven mammary tumorigenesis. In human breast cancer databases, ERBB2-expressing tumors exhibit a low autophagy gene signature, independent of BECN1 mRNA expression, and have similar gene expression profiles with non-ERBB2-expressing breast tumors with low BECN1 levels. We also found that ERBB2-expressing BT474 breast cancer cells, despite being partially autophagy-deficient under stress, can be sensitized to the anti-ERBB2 antibody trastuzumab (tzb) by further pharmacological or genetic autophagy inhibition. Our results indicate that ERBB2-driven mammary tumorigenesis is associated with functional autophagy suppression and ERBB2-positive breast cancers are partially autophagy-deficient even in a wild-type BECN1 background. Furthermore and extending earlier findings using tzb-resistant cells, exogenously imposed autophagy inhibition increases the anticancer effect of trastuzumab on tzb-sensitive ERBB2-expressing breast tumor cells, indicating that pharmacological autophagy suppression has a wider role in the treatment of ERBB2-positive breast cancer.

Cells that are transfected with the closely related receptor, erbB3, display a single class of lower affinity heregulin binding sites than has been previously observed on breast carcinoma cell lines. Little or no stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation in response to heregulin occurs in cells that are transfected with erbB3 alone. Transfection of cells with erbB3 and erbB2 reconstitutes a higher affinity binding receptor, which is also capable of generating a tyrosine phosphorylation signal in response to heregulin. A monoclonal antibody to erbB2 will inhibit heregulin activation of tyrosine phosphorylation and binding in cells transfected with both receptors but not with erbB3 alone. In cells expressing erbB2 and erbB3, both proteins become tyrosine-phosphorylated upon interaction with heregulin.

HER2 amplification and hyperactivation drive the growth and survival of breast cancers through the aberrant activation of proto-oncogenic signaling systems, particularly the Ras/MAP kinase and PI3K/AKT pathways. Although HER2-positive (HER2(+)) breast cancer was originally considered to be a highly aggressive form of the disease, the clinical landscape of HER2(+) breast cancers has literally been transformed by the approval of anti-HER2 agents for adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Indeed, pertuzumab is a novel monoclonal antibody that functions as an anti-HER2 agent by targeting the extracellular dimerization domain of the HER2 receptor; it is also the first drug to receive an accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in neoadjuvant settings in early-stage HER2(+) breast cancer. Here, we review the molecular and cellular factors that contribute to the pathophysiology of HER2 in breast cancer, as well as summarize the landmark preclinical and clinical findings underlying the approval and use of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting. Finally, the molecular mechanisms operant in mediating resistance to anti-HER2 agents, and perhaps to pertuzumab as well, will be discussed, as will the anticipated clinical impact and future directions of pertuzumab in breast cancer patients.

Cellular changes of viscoelastic features are prerequisite for cancer progression since they are essential for proliferation and metastasis.

To address this aspect we used a breast cancer cell line with inducible expression of an oncogenic version of ERBB2. ERBB2 is known to be correlated with bad prognosis in breast cancer. Cell elasticity was determined by the Optical Stretcher, where suspended cells are deformed by two slightly divergent laser beams. We found that induction of ERBB2 caused remarkable biomechanical alterations of the MCF-7 cells after 24 h: the cells actively contracted in response to mechanical stimuli, a phenomenon known as mechanoactivation. After this period, as the cells became senescent, the mechanoactivity returned to control levels. Time-resolved gene array analysis revealed that mechanoactivation was accompanied by temporal upregulation of 46 cytoskeletal genes. A possible role of these genes in tumor progression was investigated by expression analyses of 766 breast cancer patients. This showed an association of 12 out of these 46 genes with increased risk of metastasis.

In this study, we investigated the role of FASN, ErbB2-mediated glycolysis in breast cancer cell migration. First, we compared lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) protein levels, glycolysis and cell migration between FASN, ErbB2-overexpressing SK-BR-3 cells and FASN, ErbB2-low-expressing MCF7 cells. Then, SK-BR-3 cells were treated with cerulenin (Cer), an inhibitor of FASN, and ErbB2, LDHA protein levels, glycolysis, and cell migration were detected. Next, we transiently transfected ErbB2 plasmid into MCF7 cells and detected FASN, LDHA protein levels, glycolysis and cell migration. Heregulin-β1 (HRG-β1) is an activator of ErbB2 and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and oxamate (OX) are inhibitors of glycolysis. MCF7 cells were treated with HRG-β1 alone, HRG-β1 plus 2-DG, OX or cerulenin and glycolysis, and cell migration were measured. We found that FASN, ErbB2-high-expressing SK-BR-3 cells displayed higher levels of glycolysis and migration than FASN, ErbB2-low-expressing MCF7 cells. Inhibition of FASN by cerulenin impaired glycolysis and migration in SK-BR-3 cells. Transient overexpression of ErbB2 in MCF7 cells promotes glycolysis and migration. Moreover, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), oxamate (OX), or cerulenin partially reverses heregulin-β1 (HRG-β1)-induced glycolysis and migration in MCF7 cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that FASN, ErbB2-mediated glycolysis is required for breast cancer cell migration.

In this study, we determine the role of erbB3 in erbB2-mediated paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer cells. The overexpression of exogenous erbB3 via either stable or transient transfection in erbB2-overexpressing, but not epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing, breast cancer cells significantly decreases paclitaxel-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. Consistently, knockdown of erbB3 expression with a specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in breast cancer cells with coexpression of both erbB2 and erbB3 enhances paclitaxel-induced apoptosis evidenced by increased DNA fragmentation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and activation of caspase-3 and -8. Furthermore, while forced overexpression of erbB3 increases, specific knockdown of erbB3 decreases the expression levels of Survivin only in the erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Targeting Survivin with specific shRNA overcomes paclitaxel resistance without effect on the expression levels of either erbB2 or erbB3. Mechanistic studies indicate that the specific phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K), Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, but not the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, not only abrogate erbB3-mediated upregulation of Survivin, but also reinforce the erbB2/erbB3-coexpressing breast cancer cells to paclitaxel-induced growth inhibition. These data demonstrate that heterodimerization of erbB2/erbB3 is a prerequisite for erbB2 tyrosine kinase activation; and elevated expression of erbB3 is required for erbB2-mediated paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer cells via PI-3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway-dependent upregulation of Survivin.

However, most patients with advanced ERBB2 amplified breast cancers whose tumors initially respond to trastuzumab develop resistance to the drug, leading to tumor progression. To identify factors responsible for acquired resistance to trastuzumab, gene expression profiling was performed on subclones of an ERBB2 amplified breast cancer cell line, BT474, which had acquired resistance to trastuzumab. The most overexpressed gene in these subclones was PPP1R1B, encoding the DARPP-32 phosphatase inhibitor. Western analysis revealed that only the truncated isoform of the DARPP-32 protein, t-Darpp, was overexpressed in the trastuzumab resistant cells. Using gene silencing experiments, we confirmed that t-Darpp over-expression was required for trastuzumab resistance in these cells. Furthermore, transfecting t-Darpp in parental BT-474 cells conferred resistance to trastuzumab, suggesting that t-Darpp expression was sufficient for trastuzumab resistance. We also found that t-Darpp over-expression was associated with Akt activation and that the T75 residue in t-Darpp was required for both Akt activation and trastuzumab resistance. Finally, we found that full-length DARPP-32 and t-Darpp are expressed in a majority of primary breast tumors. Over-expression of full-length DARPP-32 can also confer resistance to trastuzumab and, moreover, is associated with a poor prognostic value in breast cancers.

The proto-oncogene Her-2/neu (c-erb-B2) has become an increasingly important prognostic and predictive factor in breast cancer. Overexpression/amplification of the Her-2/neu has been associated with a worse outcome in patients with breast cancer. Herceptin, a \"humanized\" murine monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the Her-2/neu protein, is being used to treat breast cancer that overexpresses Her-2/neu. The status of Her-2/neu in the tumor has become a critical factor in the management strategy of a breast cancer patient. The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of all aspects of Her-2/neu in breast cancer, including biology, prognostic and predictive value, targeted Herceptin therapy, and the laboratory testing of Her-2/neu.",

Currently, the only accepted mechanism linked with endocrine resistance is amplification or overexpression of the ERBB2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]) proto-oncogene. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that hyperactivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, the most frequently mutated pathway in breast cancer, promotes antiestrogen resistance. PI3K is a major signaling hub downstream of HER2 and other receptor tyrosine kinases. PI3K activates several molecules involved in cell-cycle progression and survival, and in ER-positive breast cancer cells, it promotes estrogen-dependent and -independent ER transcriptional activity. Preclinical tumor models of antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer often remain sensitive to estrogens and PI3K inhibition, suggesting that simultaneous targeting of the PI3K and ER pathways may be most effective. Herein, we review alterations in the PI3K pathway associated with resistance to endocrine therapy, the state of clinical development of PI3K inhibitors, and strategies for the clinical investigation of such drugs in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",

While amplification of the 17q12-21 chromosomal region often correlates with an increase in the transcriptional rates of the locus, the molecular mechanisms and the factors involved in the coordinated expression of genes residing within the ERBB2 amplicon remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα, NR3B1) and its coregulator PGC-1β are key effectors in this process. Using a mouse model of ERBB2-initiated mammary tumorigenesis, we first show that ablation of ERRα significantly delays ERBB2-induced tumor development and lowers the levels of amplicon transcripts. Chromosome 17q-wide binding site location analyses in human breast cancer cells show preferential recruitment of ERRα to DNA segments associated with the ERBB2 amplicon. Furthermore, ERRα directs the co-recruitment of the coactivator PGC-1β to segments in the 17q12 region and the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoters of the ERBB2 and coamplified genes. ERRα and PGC-1β also participate in the de-repression of ERBB2 expression through competitive genomic cross-talk with estrogen receptor α (ERα) and, as a consequence, influence tamoxifen sensitivity in breast cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that ERRα and PGC-1β are key players in the etiology of malignant breast cancer by coordinating the transcriptional regulation of genes located in the 17q12 region, a process that also involves interference with the repressive function of ERα on ERBB2 expression.",

Combinations of these drugs to more completely inhibit the HER receptor layer, or combining HER2-targeted agents with agents that target downstream signaling, alternative pathways, or components of the host immune system, are being vigorously investigated in the preclinical and clinical settings.

One of the most clinically important gene amplifications in human cancer causes extensive reduplication of ERBB2. A variety of cancers also occasionally harbor somatic mutations in ERBB2. Gene amplification and activating mutations both have predictive value for clinical response to targeted inhibitors. Since the number of gene copies in an amplicon may exceed 100, and since amplicons may encompass multiple genes, high-resolution analysis of gene amplifications poses considerable technical challenges. We have overcome this obstacle by using emulsion-based resequencing to determine the sequence of many independently-amplified individual DNA molecules in parallel. We used this high throughput sequencing technology to analyze ERBB2 mutational status in five ERBB2 amplified cell lines (four breast, one ovarian) and two breast tumors. Genomic DNA was isolated and the 28 exons of ERBB2 were independently amplified. Amplicons were then pooled at equimolar ratios, subjected to emulsion PCR (emPCR) and finally to picotiter plate pyrosequencing. High-quality sequence data were obtained for all amplicons analyzed and no activating mutations within ERBB2 were identified. Although we did not find activating mutations within the multiple copies of ERBB2 in these samples, the results establish the utility of this technology as a feasible and cost-effective approach for high resolution analysis of amplified genes.",

Because the methyl ester of the synthetic triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO-Me) is a potent chemopreventive agent, we tested its efficacy in a highly relevant mouse model of BRCA1-mutated breast cancer. Beginning at 12 weeks of age, Brca1(Co/Co); MMTV-Cre;p53(+/-) mice were fed powdered control diet or diet containing CDDO-Me (50 mg/kg diet). CDDO-Me significantly (P < 0.05) delayed tumor development in the Brca1-mutated mice by an average of 5.2 weeks. We also observed that levels of ErbB2, p-ErbB2, and cyclin D1 increased in a time-dependent manner in the mammary glands in Brca1-deficient mice, and CDDO-Me inhibited the constitutive phosphorylation of ErbB2 in tumor tissues from these mice. In BRCA1-deficient cell lines, the triterpenoids directly interacted with ErbB2, decreased constitutive phosphorylation of ErbB2, inhibited proliferation, and induced G(0)-G(1) arrest.

Similarly ERBB2 and TP53 are also key prognostic markers in breast cancer treatment.We were interested to explore the gene expression profiles of BRCA1, ERBB2 and TP53 in breast cancer women patients from Iraq so as to assess the potential of such markers in breast cancer treatment. The mRNA levels were significantly over-expressed in tumor tissues in comparison to normal ones with p values (p<0.005) observed between malignant BRCA1 and control tissue samples. Similarly significant difference (p<0.001) was observed between malignant ERBB2 in comparison to control, and malignant TP53 and benign tissue samples as well. However in blood samples, no considerable expression of these markers was observed. Out of three selected genes, ERBB2 expression was significantly expressed in comparison to BRCA1 and TP53 in cancer tissue. Mutation analysis of BRCA1, ERBB2 and TP53 has been made to find out the region most susceptible to mutations in these genes The BRCA1 exon 11, ERBB2 16 and TP53 exon 5 displayed increased chances of having mutations.

Unfortunately, the outcome of current therapies for ErbB2-positive breast cancers remains unsatisfying due to resistance and side effects. New therapies for ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers continue to be in great need. Peptide therapy using cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) as peptide carriers is promising because the internalization is highly efficient, and the cargoes delivered can be bioactive. However, the major obstacle in using these powerful CPPs for therapy is their lack of specificity. Here, we sought to develop a peptide carrier that could introduce therapeutics specifically to ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. By modifying the HIV TAT-derived CPP and conjugating anti-HER-2/neu peptide mimetic (AHNP), we developed the peptide carrier (P3-AHNP) that specifically targeted ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. A signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3)-inhibiting peptide conjugated to this peptide carrier (P3-AHNP-STAT3BP) was delivered more efficiently into ErbB2-overexpressing than ErbB2 low-expressing cancer cells in vitro and successfully decreased STAT3 binding to STAT3-interacting DNA sequence. P3-AHNP-STAT3BP inhibited cell growth in vitro, with ErbB2-overexpressing 435.eB breast cancer cells being more sensitive to the treatment than the ErbB2 low-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells. Compared with ErbB2 low-expressing MDA-MB-435 xenografts, i.p. injected P3-AHNP-STAT3BP preferentially accumulated in 435.eB xenografts, which led to more reduction of proliferation and increased apoptosis and targeted inhibition of tumor growth. This novel peptide delivery system provided a sound basis for the future development of safe and effective new-generation therapeutics to cancer-specific molecular targets.",

Identifying key cellular factors controlling invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells should pave the way to new therapeutic strategies efficiently interfering with the metastatic process. PAX2 (paired box 2) transcription factor is expressed by breast cancer cells in vivo and recently, it was shown to negatively regulate the expression of ERBB2 (erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, HER-2/neu), a well-documented pro-invasive and pro-metastastic gene, in luminal/ERalpha-positive (ERα+) breast cancer cells. The objective of the present study was to investigate a putative role for PAX2 in the control of luminal breast cancer cells invasion, and to begin to characterize its regulation.;PAX2 activity was higher in cell lines from luminal compared to non-luminal subtype, and activation of PAX2 by estradiol was selectively achieved in breast cancer cell lines of the luminal subtype. This process was blocked by ICI 182780 and could be antagonized by IGF-1. Knockdown of PAX2 in luminal MCF-7 cells completely abrogated estradiol-induced downregulation of ERBB2 and decrease of cell invasion, whereas overexpression of PAX2 in these cells enhanced estradiol effects on ERBB2 levels and cell invasion.;The study demonstrates that PAX2 activation by estradiol is selectively achieved in breast cancer cells of the luminal subtype, via ERα, and identifies IGF-1 as a negative regulator of PAX2 activity in these cells. Further, it reveals a new role for PAX2 in the maintenance of a low invasive behavior in luminal breast cancer cells upon exposure to estradiol, and shows that overexpression and activation of PAX2 in these cells is sufficient to reduce their invasive ability.",

We assessed the prognostic value of ICD and ECD expression in 180 patients from a clinical trial of adjuvant chemotherapy followed by trastuzumab (HeCOG 10/05). We performed an exploratory univariate domain-specific, disease-free survival (DFS) analysis and compared DFS functions with Kaplan-Meier estimates. All statistical tests were two-sided.;HER2 ICD expression by QIF showed slightly higher sensitivity to predict ERBB2 (HER2) gene amplification than ECD expression, which was more specific and had higher positive predictive value. In the HeCOG 10/05 trial specimens, 15% of cases showed discordant results for ICD and ECD expression. High ECD was statistically associated with longer DFS (log-rank P = .049, HR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.144 to 0.997), while ICD status was not. Among patients with low ECD, there was no difference in DFS by ICD status. However, when ICD was high, high ECD was statistically associated with longer DFS (log-rank P = .027, HR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.037 to 0.82) compared with low ECD.;Quantitative measurements of HER2 ICD and ECD expression in breast cancer suggest a subclassification of HER2-positive tumors.

Given the emerging role of ARID3B in tumor development, we examined its expression in primary patient-derived breast cancer samples and breast cancer-derived cell lines.;Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect ARID3B expression in 63 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) invasive breast cancer samples. In addition, a panel of 6 (estrogen receptor-positive and -negative, ERBB2-positive and -negative) breast cancer-derived cell lines and immortalized non-tumorigenic epithelial breast cells were used for ARID3B expression analysis using RT-PCR. Specific primers and Western blotting were used to detect ARID3B isoforms.;Using IHC, nuclear, cytoplasmic and low levels of membranous ARID3B staining were detected in all 63 primary invasive breast tumors. Nuclear ARID3B staining positively correlated with estrogen receptor (ER) status and negatively correlated with tumor grade, mitotic index and ERBB2 status of the patients. Increased nuclear expression of ARID3B was confirmed in breast cancer-derived cell lines expressing ERα. In addition, two out of three ERBB2-positive breast cancer cell lines were found to lack full length ARID3B. Three ARID3B isoforms were found to be present in normal breast epithelial cells as well as in breast cancer cells.;We report a positive correlation between ER positivity and nuclear ARID3B expression in primary breast cancers, along with a negative correlation with the ERBB2 status.

Using ERBB2-overexpressing human breast cancer cells (SKBR3), the mRNA stability factor HuR was shown to support ERBB2 transcript integrity, bind and endogenously associate with a conserved U-rich element within the ERBB2 transcript 3' UTR, coimmunoprecipitate with RNA-associated HDAC activity, and colocalize with HDAC6. HDAC6 also coimmunoprecipitates with HuR in an RNA-dependent manner and within 6 hours of exposure to a pan-HDAC inhibitor dose, that does not significantly alter cytosolic HuR levels or HuR binding to ERBB2 mRNA. Cellular ERBB2 transcript levels decline while remaining physically associated with HDAC6. Knockdown of HDAC6 protein by small interfering RNA partially suppressed the ERBB2 transcript decay induced by either pan-HDAC or HDAC6-selective enzymatic inhibitors. Three novel hydroxamates, ST71, ST17, and ST80 were synthesized and shown to inhibit HDAC6 with 14-fold to 31-fold greater selectivity over their binding and inhibition of HDAC1. Unlike more potent pan-HDAC inhibitors, these HDAC6-selective inhibitors produced dose-dependent growth arrest of ERBB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells by accelerating the decay of mature ERBB2 mRNA without repressing ERBB2 promoter function. In sum, these findings point to the therapeutic potential of HuR and HDAC6-selective inhibitors, contrasting ERBB2 stability effects induced by HDAC6 enzymatic inhibition and HDAC6 protein knockdown, and show that ERBB2 transcript stability mechanisms include exploitable targets for the development of novel anticancer therapies.",

Normalized mRNA levels were evaluated for association with progression-free survival (PFS) in 242 patients receiving tamoxifen as first-line monotherapy for recurrent disease, and with distant metastasis-free survival (MFS) in 413 lymph node-negative (LNN) primary breast cancer patients who did not receive systemic adjuvant therapy.;Concerning tamoxifen resistance, BCAR3, ERBB2, GRB7, and TLE3 mRNA levels were predictive for PFS, independent of traditional predictive factors. By combining GRB7 (or ERBB2) and TLE3 mRNA levels, patients could be classified in three subgroups with distinct PFS. For the evaluation of tumor aggressiveness, AKT2, EGFR, and TRERF1 mRNA levels were all significantly associated with MFS, independent of traditional prognostic factors. Using the combined AKT2 and EGFR mRNA status, four prognostic groups were identified with different MFS outcomes.;The majority of BCAR genes, which were revealed to confer tamoxifen resistance and estrogen independence in vitro by functional screening, have clinical relevance, and associate with tamoxifen resistance and/or tumor aggressiveness in breast cancer patients.",

BLAST programs revealed that mouse AK031099 cDNA was derived from mouse Erbb2 gene. Because AK031099 cDNA showed 806 C-->A nucleotide substitution compared with mouse genome draft sequences and mouse Erbb2 ESTs, the nucleotide sequence of mouse Erbb2 cDNA was determined in silico by correcting 806 A of AK031099 cDNA to C. Nucleotide position 48-3818 of mouse Erbb2 cDNA was the coding region. Mouse Erbb2 gene, consisting of 27 exons, was located within the Ppp1r1b-Grb7 locus on the mouse chromosome 11. Mouse Erbb2 protein (1256 aa) showed 87.5% total-amino-acid identity with human ERBB2 protein, and 95.2% total-amino-acid identity with rat Erbb2 protein. Mouse Ppp1r1b-Grb7 locus and human Ppp1r1b-Grb7 locus were evolutionarily conserved in the order and the orientation of genes therein. Nucleotide and amino-acid substitution rates of Neurod2 located centromeric to the Ppp1r1b-Grb7 locus were significantly lower than others within the Ppp1r1b-Grb7 locus.

However, its prognosis value, albeit recognized for node-positive patients, remains controversial for those without apparent nodal involvement. One possible reason for this problem is likely to be the difficulty of defining threshold levels for ERBB2 protein overexpression. ERBB2 protein expression was therefore analyzed in primary invasive breast tumors. Quantification of the gene product by a commercial ELISA test was compared to results obtained by immunohistochemistry and western blotting, as well as to gene amplification status determined by Southern blotting. Correlations between results obtained by the different techniques were highly significant (P value < 10(-6)). Nevertheless, ELISA permitted us to determine three levels of protein expression corresponding to distinct tumor subsets. 1) Tumors with p185/ERBB2 expression levels exceeding 10 U/microgram exhibited in most cases amplification of the gene (83% of cases), DNA aneuploidy (81%) and absence of estrogen receptor (ER) (44%). Such high levels of protein expression were exclusively observed in invasive ductal carcinomas and were prevalent in those showing a significant in situ component. 2) \"Intermediate\" levels of expression (3-10 U/micrograms) were rarely observed in tumors exhibiting gene amplification (9%), but were preferentially found in cancers of more favorable prognosis (only 49% were aneuploid and 9% estrogen receptor negative). 3) Levels of p185/ERBB2 below 3 U/micrograms were detected in benign mastopathies and, thus, carcinomas presenting such levels were scored ERBB2 negative. Interestingly, invasive lobular carcinomas were rarely ERBB2 positive, and if so, only at intermediate levels. Moreover, our data show a complex interrelationship between p185/ERBB2 expression and ER levels. Indeed, tumors with more than 10 U/micrograms of p185 were prevalently ER, whereas those with p185 ranging from 3 to 10 U presented elevated levels of ER.",

For example, knowledge of the expression of the estrogen and progesterone hormone receptors (ER and PR), and that of the ERBB2 in breast tumor samples enables choice of therapies for the breast cancer patients that express these proteins. Identifying new biomarkers and therapeutic agents affecting the activity of signaling pathways regulated by the hormone receptors or ERBB2 might be accelerated by knowledge of their expression levels in large gene expression profiling data sets. Unfortunately, the status of these receptors is not invariably reported in public databases of breast tumor gene expression profiles. Attempts have been made to employ a single probe set to identify ER, PR and ERBB2 status, but the specificity or sensitivity of their prediction is low. We enquired whether estimation of ER, PR and ERBB2 status of profiled tumor samples could be improved by using multiple probe sets representing these three genes and others with related expression.We used 8 independent datasets of human breast tumor samples to define gene expression signatures comprising 24, 51 and 14 genes predictive of ER, PR and ERBB2 status respectively. These signatures, as demonstrated by sensitivity and specificity measures, reliably identified hormone receptor and ERBB2 expression in breast tumors that had been previously determined using protein and DNA based assays. Our findings demonstrate that gene signatures can be identified which reliably predict the expression status of the estrogen and progesterone hormone receptors and that of ERBB2 in publically available gene expression profiles of breast tumor samples. Using these signatures to query transcript profiles of breast tumor specimens may enable discovery of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for particular subtypes of breast cancer.",

However, the mechanism of ErbB2-mediated p21(Cip1) up-regulation is unclear. Here, we show that ErbB2 up-regulates p21(Cip1) transcription through increased Src activity in ErbB2-overexpressing cells. Src activation further activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) that recognizes a SIE binding site on the p21(Cip1) promoter required for ErbB2-mediated p21(Cip1) transcriptional up-regulation. Both Src and STAT3 inhibitors restored Taxol sensitivity in resistant ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Our data suggest that ErbB2 overexpression can activate STAT3 through Src leading to transcriptional up-regulation of p21(Cip1) that confers Taxol resistance of breast cancer cells.

Here, we demonstrate that the ErbB2ΔEx16 is a major oncogenic driver in breast cancer that constitutively signals from the cell surface. We further show that inducible expression of the ErbB2ΔEx16 variant in mammary gland of transgenic mice results in the rapid development of metastatic multifocal mammary tumors. Genetic and biochemical characterization of the ErbB2ΔEx16-derived mammary tumors exhibit several unique features that distinguish this model from the conventional ErbB2 ones expressing the erbB2 proto-oncogene in mammary epithelium. Unlike the wild-type ErbB2-derived tumors that express luminal keratins, ErbB2ΔEx16-derived tumors exhibit high degree of intratumoral heterogeneity co-expressing both basal and luminal keratins.

Tissue samples from 248 patients with primary breast cancer were consecutively assayed. We used two different cut-off levels for WB, ELISA, and EIA, defined as follows: 1) the highest level of expression of non malignant tissue was chosen as the discriminant threshold between 'low' and 'elevated' samples: 2) the elevated group was further subdivided into two subgroups: 'intermediate' and 'high', according to their median value. According to the first cut-off, the results were considered 'elevated' in about 52% of cases with the three biochemical methods, while using the second cut-off the percentage lowered to about 26%. Considering this cut-off, the concordance rates between the paired biochemical methods ranged between: 78.4% (WB vs EIA), 93% (ELISA vs EIA), and 82.6% (ELISA vs WB). The comparison between biochemical and immunohistochemical methods gave these concordance rates: 82% (WB vs IHC), 90.5% (ELISA vs IHC), and 85.5% (EIA vs. IHC). According to the first cut off level, 27.5% of tumor samples showed IHC detectable p185 levels, in agreement with other immunohistochemical studies. The relationship between high erbB2 and estrogen and progesterone receptors showed an inverse association. No relationship was found between erbB2 and axillary lymph node positivity or tumor size.

        "Doc_abstract":"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with different morphologies, molecular profiles, clinical behaviour and response to therapy. The triple negative is a particular type of breast cancer defined by absence of oestrogen and progesterone receptor expression as well as absence of ERBB2 amplification. It is characterized by its biological aggressiveness, worse prognosis and lack of a therapeutic target in contrast with hormonal receptor positive and ERBB2+ breast cancers. Given these characteristics, triple-negative breast cancer is a challenge in today's clinical practice. A new breast cancer classification emerged recently in the scientific scene based in gene expression profiles. The new subgroups (luminal, ERBB2, normal breast and basal-like) have distinct gene expression patterns and phenotypical characteristics. Triple-negative breast cancer shares phenotypical features with basal-like breast cancer, which is in turn the most aggressive and with worse outcome. Since microarray gene-expression assays are only used in the research setting, clinicians use the triple-negative definition as a surrogate of basal-like breast cancer. The aim of this review, that focuses on triple-negative breast cancer, is to summarize the most relevant knowledge on this particular type of cancer in terms of molecular features, pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, current treatments and the new therapeutic options that include the use of platinum compounds, EGFR antagonists, antiangiogenics and PARP inhibitors. Advances in research are promising and new types of active drugs will become a reality in the near future, making possible a better outcome for this subgroup of breast cancer patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Although treatment with trastuzumab improves outcomes for women with ErbB2-positive breast cancer, many patients who achieve an initial response to trastuzumab subsequently acquire resistance within 1 year. Rac1, a Ras-like small GTPase, has been implicated in the control of cell growth and morphology and is believed to be associated with breast cancer progression and metastasis. Here, we show that when parental SKBR3 cells become resistant to trastuzumab, Rac1 activity is increased, leading to altered cell morphology, which is accompanied by significant cytoskeleton disorganization. Furthermore, both trastuzumab-mediated down-regulation of ErbB2 and epidermal growth factor-induced down-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor are impaired in the trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3 cells, indicating that the endocytic down-regulation of ErbB receptors is compromised in the resistant cells. This results in an aberrant accumulation of ErbB2 on the cell surface and enhanced ErbB2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity in trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3 cells. Additionally, overexpression of constitutively active Rac1G12V in parental SKBR3 cells reduces sensitivity to trastuzumab. After reduction of Rac1 activity by NSC23766, a specific Rac1 inhibitor, trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3 cells display a cellular morphology similar to parental SKBR3 cells. Moreover, we show that NSC23766 restores trastuzumab-mediated endocytic down-regulation of ErbB2 and reduces extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity in resistant SKBR3 cells. Our findings highlight an important role for Rac1 in trastuzumab resistance of human breast cancer cells and identify the impaired trastuzumab-mediated endocytic down-regulation of ErbB2 as a novel mechanism of trastuzumab resistance. The significant effects of NSC23766 on trastuzumab-resistant SKBR3 cells warrant further study of NSC23766 as a potential treatment of trastuzumab-resistant breast cancers.",

Several studies have shown a link between activator protein 2 (AP-2) transcription factors and ERBB2 gene expression in breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, the Yin Yang 1 (YY1) transcription factor has been shown to stimulate AP-2 transcriptional activity on the ERBB2 promoter in vitro. In this report, we examined the relationships between ERBB2, AP-2alpha, and YY1 both in breast cancer tissue specimens and in a mammary cancer cell line.;ERBB2, AP-2alpha, and YY1 protein levels were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a panel of 55 primary breast tumors. ERBB2 gene amplification status was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Correlations were evaluated by a chi2 test at a p value of less than 0.05. The functional role of AP-2alpha and YY1 on ERBB2 gene expression was analyzed by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection in the BT-474 mammary cancer cell line followed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting.;We observed a statistically significant correlation between ERBB2 and AP-2alpha levels in the tumors (p < 0.01). Moreover, associations were found between ERBB2 protein level and the combined high expression of AP-2alpha and YY1 (p < 0.02) as well as between the expression of AP-2alpha and YY1 (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the levels of both AP-2alpha and YY1 proteins were inversely correlated to ERBB2 gene amplification status in the tumors (p < 0.01). Transfection of siRNAs targeting AP-2alpha and AP-2gamma mRNAs in the BT-474 breast cancer cell line repressed the expression of the endogenous ERBB2 gene at both the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, the additional transfection of an siRNA directed against the YY1 transcript further reduced the ERBB2 protein level, suggesting that AP-2 and YY1 transcription factors cooperate to stimulate the transcription of the ERBB2 gene.;This study highlights the role of both AP-2alpha and YY1 transcription factors in ERBB2 oncogene overexpression in breast tumors.

Breast cancer immunotherapy includes antibody based immunotherapy, cancer vaccine immunotherapy, adoptive T cell transfer immunotherapy and T cell receptor gene transfer immunotherapy. Antibody based immunotherapy such as the monoclonal antibody against HER-2/neu (trastuzumab) is successfully used in the treatment of breast cancer patients with over-expressed HER-2/neu, however, HER-2/neu is over-expressed only in 25-30% of breast cancer patients. Cancer vaccine immunotherapy is a promising method to treat cancer patients. Cancer vaccines can be used to induce specific anti-tumor immunity in breast cancer patients, but cannot induce objective tumor regression. Adoptive T cell transfer immunotherapy is an effective method in the treatment of melanoma patients. Recent advances in anti-tumor T cell generation ex vivo and limited clinical trial data have made the feasibility of adoptive T cell transfer immunotherapy in the treatment of breast cancer patients.

The erbB2 proto-oncogene is overexpressed in approximately 30% of breast cancers and is a major prognostic parameter when present in invasive disease. A ligand for the erbB2 receptor has not yet been identified but it can be activated by heterodimerization with heregulin (HRG)-stimulated erbB3 and erbB4 receptors. The HRGs are a family of polypeptide growth factors that have been shown to play a role in embryogenesis, tumor formation, growth and differentiation of breast cancer cells. The erbB3 and erbB4 receptors are involved in transregulation of erbB2 signaling. The work presented here suggests biological roles for HRG including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and induction of motility and invasion in breast cancer cells. HRG-expressing breast cancer cell lines are characterized by low erbB receptor levels and a high invasive and metastatic index, while those which overexpress erbB2 demonstrate minimal invasive potential in vitro and are non-tumorigenic in vivo. Treatment of the highly tumorigenic and metastatic HRG-expressing breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 with an HRG-neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited proliferation in culture and motility in the Boyden chamber assay. Addition of exogenous HRG to non-invasive erbB2 overexpressing cells (SKBr-3) at low concentrations induced formation of pseudopodia, enhanced phagocytic activity and increased chemomigration and invasion in the Boyden chamber assay. The specificity of the chemomigration response to HRG is demonstrated by inhibition with the anti-HRG neutralizing antibody. These results suggest that either HRG can act as an autocrine or paracrine ligand to promote the invasive behavior of breast cancer cells in vitro or thus may enhance the metastatic process in vivo.",

Current knowledge on the pathogenesis of male breast cancer (MBC) is limited. The purpose of our study was to investigate the potential relevance of a series of genes known to be amplified in female breast cancer (FBC) in a the development and pathogenesis of MBC. To this end, we applied fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to the analysis of 128 breast tumors from males. Amplification of ERBB2, MYC, PPM1D and ZNF217 was detected rarely (1-2% of tumors) indicating a considerably lower amplification frequency than in FBC. CCND1 amplification was observed in 12% of cases, being in good concordance with findings from FBC. In addition, CCND1 overexpression was detected in 63% of tumors and was associated with ER positivity (p < 0.0001). Our results indicate distinct differences in the genetic basis of MBC and FBC and suggest that marked differences exist in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The lack of ERBB2 involvement was especially unexpected and implies that ERBB2-targeted therapies are unlikely to be beneficial in MBC. Furthermore, the high frequency of hormone receptor positivity and the association between ER positivity and CCND1 overexpression supports the notion that hormonal regulation is likely to be essential for the development of MBC.",

Previous results from our and other laboratories indicated that elevated transcriptional activity contributes significantly to the overexpression of ERBB2 mRNA in mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines. Activator protein 2 (AP-2) transcription factors account for this overexpression through two recognition sequences located 215 and 500 bp upstream from the transcription start site. Furthermore, AP-2 transcription factors are highly expressed in cancer cell lines overexpressing ERBB2. In this report, we examined the cooperative effect of Yin Yang 1 (YY1) on AP-2-induced activation of ERBB2 promoter activity. We detected high levels of YY1 transcription factor in mammary cancer cell lines. Notably, we showed that YY1 enhances AP-2alpha transcriptional activation of the ERBB2 promoter through an AP-2 site both in HepG2 and in HCT116 cells, whereas a carboxyl-terminal-truncated form of YY1 cannot. Moreover, we demonstrated the interaction between endogenous AP-2 and YY1 factors in the BT-474 mammary adenocarcinoma cell line. In addition, inhibition of endogenous YY1 protein by an antisense decreased the transcription of an AP-2-responsive ERBB2 reporter plasmid in BT-474 breast cancer cells. Finally, we detected in vivo AP-2 and YY1 occupancy of the ERBB2 proximal promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Our data thus provide evidence that YY1 cooperates with AP-2 to stimulate ERBB2 promoter activity through the AP-2 binding sites.",

Despite this fact we are facing several unresolved questions and issues. Probably the most frequently discussed predictive marker in breast carcinoma is HER-2/neu. The change of criteria of positivity in 2007 brought several confusions regarding the selection of patients eligible for anti-HER2 treatment. There is a deficiency of knowledge in tumors with the discordant phenotype (a discrepancy between the results of immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization). Even in selected HER2 positive patients is the anti-HER2 treatment effective in only 30 % of cases.

They have long been divided into those that are hormone sensitive [as defined by expression of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and/or the progesterone receptor (PR)] and those that are not. Notably, only those breast cancers that express ERalpha and/or PR typically respond to hormonal therapy with tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, or the newer agent fulvestrant. More recently, the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor HER-2/neu was identified as an oncogene overexpressed by about 30% of breast cancers. These HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancers define a subset of breast tumors that are characteristically more aggressive, and women who develop them have a shorter survival. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for HER-2/neu, has revolutionized the management of metastatic HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancers. As a single agent, it produces response rates similar to those of many single-agent chemotherapeutic agents active in metastatic breast cancer and has limited toxicity. Combining trastuzumab with chemotherapy can result in synergistic antitumor activity. The clear efficacy of trastuzumab against HER-2/neu-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer has led to a keen interest in testing its role in the management of early breast cancer, and multiple large clinical trials are currently in progress. This review summarizes the available clinical data on the use of trastuzumab in HER-neu-overexpressing breast cancer and briefly highlights emerging opportunities for innovative, trastuzumab-based breast cancer therapies.",

A prior NIST workshop addressed this need by reaching a consensus to create cell lines as reference materials for HER2 testing.;Breast carcinoma cell lines SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 were characterized quantitatively by IHC with chicken anti-HER2 IgY antibody and by FISH with biotinylated bacterial artificial chromosome DNA probes; both assays used quantum dots as detectors. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cell blocks were prepared and tested for suitability as candidate reference materials by IHC and FISH with commercially available reagents. IHC and FISH results were also compared with those obtained by laser-scanning cytometry and real-time PCR, respectively.;MCF-7 cells had typical numbers of gene copies and very low production of HER2 protein, whereas SK-BR-3 cells contained approximately 10-fold more copies of the gene and exhibited approximately 15-fold higher amounts of HER2 protein than MCF-7 cells. FFPE SK-BR-3 cells showed results similar to those for fresh SK-BR-3 cells.;SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 are suitable as candidate reference materials in QC of HER2 testing.

We have previously reported that the growth factor receptor bound protein-2 (Grb2) is required for the proliferation of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. We investigated here whether Grb2 protein plays a role in heregulin-stimulated proliferation. Grb2 protein inhibition led to growth inhibition of heregulin-stimulated breast cancer cells, but not Erk1,2 inactivation. These findings are similar to our earlier observations in ErbB2-overexpressing cells. Since Akt can also be activated by heregulin, the effects of Grb2 inhibition on Akt were examined. Akt was inactivated following Grb2 downregulation in heregulin-stimulated breast cancer cells. We then examined the effects of Grb2 downregulation on Akt in ErbB2-overexpressing cells in the absence of heregulin. Similar to heregulin-stimulated cells, Grb2 inhibition also led to Akt inactivation in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.

The objective of this review was to summarize the reported prevalence of ErbB2-positive tumors from a large sample of Asian patients and to examine ErbB2 assessment methods in Asia. From searches of MEDLINE, local language journals, and local and international conference proceedings as well as locoregional breast cancer experts' recommendations, the authors selected up to 5 studies each from India, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand that reported ErbB2 results based on assessment with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The reported prevalence of ErbB2-positive tumors in 22 studies on 24,671 patients, of whom 14,398 patients were assessed for ErbB2 status, varied widely (range, 6%-65%) as did the assessment methods used. Most studies (n=21) used IHC to assess ErbB2 status, but definitions for positivity varied. When robust assessment methods were used, the median prevalence was 19% based on strong IHC staining (IHC3+; n=9812 patients) and 25% based on FISH (n=681 patients). Data on the prevalence of ErbB2-positive breast cancer in Asia are limited.

Here, we report that in a retrovirus-based somatic mouse model (replication-competent ALV-LTR splice acceptor/tumor virus A) that closely mimics the evolution of sporadic human breast cancers, mammary epithelial cells harboring PyMT or activated ErbB2 evolve into tumors independent of estrogen or other ovarian functions in contrast to previous observations of estrogen-dependent cancer formation in germ line mouse models of ErbB2 activation. Importantly, ErbB2 activation in normal mammary cells causes estrogen-independent proliferation in both estrogen receptor (ER)-negative cells as well as in normally quiescent ER-positive cells. Therefore, aberrant activation of growth factor signaling contributes to estrogen-independent proliferation of both preneoplastic and cancerous mammary cells, and prophylactic therapy against both growth factor signaling and estrogen signaling may need to be considered in women with increased risk of breast cancer.",

Here we show that caveolin-1 expression in breast cancer derived SKBR-3 cells (SKBR-3/Cav-1) facilitates ligand induced ErbB2 endocytosis using an artificial peptide ligand EC-eGFP. Similarly, stimulation with humanized anti ErbB2 antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) was found to be internalized and co-localized with caveolin-1 in SKBR-3/Cav-1 cells. Internalized EC-eGFP and Trastuzumab in SKBR-3/Cav-1 cells were then delivered via caveolae to the caveolin-1 containing early endosomes. Consequently, attenuated Fc receptor mediated ADCC functions were observed when exposed to Trastuzumab and EC-Fc (EC-1 peptide conjugated to Fc part of human IgG). On the other hand, this caveolae dependent endocytic synergy was not observed in parental SKBR-3 cells. Therefore, caveolin-1 expression in breast cancer cells could be a predictive factor to estimate how cancer cells are likely to respond to Trastuzumab treatment. ",

GAS and ERBB2 protein expression was studied by Western immunoblotting from gastric cancer cell lines with or without gain at 17q12-q21 as well as a breast cancer cell line with ERBB2 amplification. Our results showed that simultaneous amplification of both GAS and ERBB2 was four- to ninefold in the tumors with the 17q12-q21 amplification. Both genes were amplified in the same nuclei, and the hybridization signals were localized to the same region of the nucleus. Overexpression of GAS and ERBB2 was observed by Western immunoblotting only in the gastric cancer cell line with gain at 17q12-q21. The ERBB2 amplification is also a recurrent change in breast cancer. To investigate whether the GAS amplification is unique in gastric cancer, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was performed on 40 breast cancer cell lines. The ERBB2 amplification was observed in 11 cell lines, but none of the lines showed the GAS amplification. This indicates that the formation of an amplicon, in which both the GAS and the ERBB2 genes are amplified, might be unique in gastric cancer, especially in its intestinal type, and that simultaneous amplification of both genes is important to the tumorigenesis of intestinal gastric cancer.

How circulating IGF-I may promote breast cancer incidence is unknown, however, increased IGF-I signaling is linked to trastuzumab resistance in ErbB2 positive breast cancer. Few models have directly examined the effect of moderately high levels of circulating IGF-I on breast cancer initiation and progression. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of circulating IGF-I to independently initiate mammary tumorigenesis and/or accelerate the progression of ErbB2 mediated mammary tumor growth.;We crossed heterozygous TTR-IGF-I mice with heterozygous MMTV-ErbB2 mice to generate 4 different genotypes: TTR-IGF-I/MMTV-ErbB2 (bigenic), TTR-IGF-I only, MMTV-ErbB2 only, and wild type (wt). Virgin females were palpated twice a week and harvested when tumors reached 1000 mm(3). For study of normal development, blood and tissue were harvested at 4, 6 and 9 weeks of age in TTR-IGF-I and wt mice.;TTR-IGF-I and TTR-IGF-I/ErbB2 bigenic mice showed a moderate 35% increase in circulating total IGF-I compared to ErbB2 and wt control mice. Elevation of circulating IGF-I had no effect upon pubertal mammary gland development. The transgenic increase in IGF-I alone wasn't sufficient to initiate mammary tumorigenesis. Elevated circulating IGF-I had no effect upon ErbB2-induced mammary tumorigenesis or metastasis, with median time to tumor formation being 30 wks and 33 wks in TTR-IGF-I/ErbB2 bigenic and ErbB2 mice respectively (p = 0.65). Levels of IGF-I in lysates from ErbB2/TTR-IGF-I tumors compared to ErbB2 was elevated in a similar manner to the circulating IGF-I, however, there was no effect on the rate of tumor growth (p = 0.23). There were no morphological differences in tumor type (solid adenocarcinomas) between bigenic and ErbB2 mammary glands.;Using the first transgenic animal model to elevate circulating levels of IGF-I to those comparable to women at increased risk of breast cancer, we showed that moderately high levels of systemic IGF-I have no effect on pubertal mammary gland development, initiating mammary tumorigenesis or promoting ErbB2 driven mammary carcinogenesis. Our work suggests that ErbB2-induced mammary tumorigenesis is independent of the normal variation in circulating levels of IGF-I.",

Here, we studied whether overexpression of ErbB2 may lead to mitotic deregulation in breast cancer cells via up-regulation of survivin that confers Taxol resistance.;ErbB2-overexpressing and ErbB2-low-expressing breast cancer cell lines were used to compare their mitotic exit rate, survivin expression level, and apoptosis level in response to Taxol. Survivin was then down-regulated by antisense oligonucleotides to evaluate its contribution to mitotic exit and Taxol resistance in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. At last, specific PI3K/Akt and Src inhibitors were used to investigate the involvement of these two pathways in ErbB2-mediated survivin up-regulation and Taxol resistance.;We found that ErbB2-overexpressing cells expressed higher levels of survivin in multiple breast cancer cell lines and patient samples. ErbB2-overexpressing cells exited M phase faster than ErbB2-low-expressing cells, which correlated with the increased resistance to Taxol-induced apoptosis. Down-regulation of survivin by antisense oligonucleotide delayed mitotic exit of ErbB2-overexpressing cells and also sensitized ErbB2-overexpressing cells to Taxol-induced apoptosis. Moreover, ErbB2 up-regulated survivin at translational level and PI3K/Akt and Src activation are involved. In addition, combination treatment of Taxol with PI3K/Akt and Src inhibitor led to increased apoptosis in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells than single treatment.;Survivin up-regulation by ErbB2 is a critical event in ErbB2-mediated faster mitotic exit and contributes to Taxol resistance.",

Here, we examine ErbB2 expression and localization in both cardiac and skeletal muscle of adult mice via immunoblot and immunohistochemistry. ErbB2 was detected as a band approximately 185 kD molecular mass in each cardiac and skeletal muscle extraction. Confocal images of double labeling showed that ErbB2 was colocalized with caveolin-3 in cardiac muscle and with dihydropyridine receptor in skeletal muscle, suggesting that ErbB2 was localized at the T-tubule. In addition, immunoelectron micrographs clearly demonstrated that ErbB2 was located at the T-tubule in both types of muscle.

Considerable interest has developed in searching for novel FASN inhibitors as therapeutic agents in treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. Amentoflavone was found to be effective in suppressing FASN expression in HER2-positive SKBR3 cells. Pharmacological inhibition of FASN by amentoflavone specifically down-regulated HER2 protein and mRNA, and caused an up-regulation of PEA3, a transcriptional repressor of HER2. In addition, pharmacological blockade of FASN by amentoflavone preferentially decreased cell viability and induced cell death in SKBR3 cells. Palmitate reduced the cytotoxic effect of amentoflavone, as the percentage of viable cells was increased after the addition of exogenous palmitate. Amentoflavone-induced FASN inhibition inhibited the translocation of SREBP-1 in SKBR3 cells. Amentoflavone inhibited phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, and JNK. The use of pharmacological inhibitors revealed that the modulation of AKT, mTOR, and JNK phosphorylation required synergistic amentoflavone-induced FASN inhibition and HER2 activation in SKBR3 cells. These results suggest that amentoflavone modulated FASN expression by regulation of HER2-pathways, and induced cell death to enhance chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic activity in HER2-positive breast cancers.",

Discrepancies between these methods may lead to different treatment decisions.;We used the PAM50 RT-qPCR assay to expression profile 814 tumors from the GEICAM/9906 phase III clinical trial that enrolled women with locally advanced primary invasive breast cancer. All samples were scored at a single site by IHC for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and Her2/neu (HER2) protein expression. Equivocal HER2 cases were confirmed by chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH). Single gene scores by IHC/CISH were compared with RT-qPCR continuous gene expression values and \"intrinsic\" subtype assignment by the PAM50. High, medium, and low expression for ESR1, PGR, ERBB2, and proliferation were selected using quartile cut-points from the continuous RT-qPCR data across the PAM50 subtype assignments.;ESR1, PGR, and ERBB2 gene expression had high agreement with established binary IHC cut-points (area under the curve (AUC) ≥ 0.9). Estrogen receptor positivity by IHC was strongly associated with Luminal (A and B) subtypes (92%), but only 75% of ER negative tumors were classified into the HER2-E and Basal-like subtypes. Luminal A tumors more frequently expressed PR than Luminal B (94% vs 74%) and Luminal A tumors were less likely to have high proliferation (11% vs 77%). Seventy-seven percent (30/39) of ER-/HER2+ tumors by IHC were classified as the HER2-E subtype. Triple negative tumors were mainly comprised of Basal-like (57%) and HER2-E (30%) subtypes. Single gene scoring for ESR1, PGR, and ERBB2 was more prognostic than the corresponding IHC markers as shown in a multivariate analysis.;The standard immunohistochemical panel for breast cancer (ER, PR, and HER2) does not adequately identify the PAM50 gene expression subtypes.

Clinical outcome can be substantially improved by ERBB2-targeted therapy. Lapatinib is a potent, orally bioavailable small molecule that reversibly and selectively inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR1 or ERBB1) and ERBB2 tyrosine kinases. Lapatinib binds the adenosine triphosphate-binding site of the receptor's intracellular domain to inhibit tumor cell growth. This review summarizes the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and tolerability of lapatinib, and reviews both Food and Drug Administration-approved and investigational uses of lapatinib in breast cancer therapy. The drug is generally well tolerated in patients, with diarrhea and rashes being the most common (usually mild or moderate) adverse effects. Unlike trastuzumab, lapatinib has infrequent adverse effects on cardiac function. Lapatinib has substantial activity for advanced ERBB2-positive breast cancer, particularly in combination with capecitabine, following progression after anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab. Lapatinib combined with capecitabine yielded significant improvements in time to progression and response rate compared with capecitabine alone. This drug can also be combined with letrozole for the treatment of postmenopausal women with ERBB2-positive breast cancer, for whom hormonal therapy is indicated.

Despite its small size, chromosome 17 is rich in protein-coding genes; it contains many cancer-associated genes, including BRCA1, ERBB2, (Her2/neu), and TP53. The goal of this study was to examine the splice variants expressed in three ERBB2 expressed breast cancer cell-line models of hormone-receptor-negative breast cancers by integrating RNA-Seq and proteomic mass spectrometry data. The cell lines represent distinct phenotypic variations subtype: SKBR3 (ERBB2+ (overexpression)/ER-/PR-; adenocarcinoma), SUM190 (ERBB2+ (overexpression)/ER-/PR-; inflammatory breast cancer), and SUM149 (ERBB2 (low expression) ER-/PR-; inflammatory breast cancer). We identified more than one splice variant for 1167 genes expressed in at least one of the three cancer cell lines. We found multiple variants of genes that are in the signaling pathways downstream of ERBB2 along with variants specific to one cancer cell line compared with the other two cancer cell lines and with normal mammary cells. The overall transcript profiles based on read counts indicated more similarities between SKBR3 and SUM190. The top-ranking Gene Ontology and BioCarta pathways for the cell-line specific variants pointed to distinct key mechanisms including: amino sugar metabolism, caspase activity, and endocytosis in SKBR3; different aspects of metabolism, especially of lipids in SUM190; cell-to-cell adhesion, integrin, and ERK1/ERK2 signaling; and translational control in SUM149. The analyses indicated an enrichment in the electron transport chain processes in the ERBB2 overexpressed cell line models and an association of nucleotide binding, RNA splicing, and translation processes with the IBC models, SUM190 and SUM149. Detailed experimental studies on the distinct variants identified from each of these three breast cancer cell line models that may open opportunities for drug target discovery and help unveil their specific roles in cancer progression and metastasis.

Amplification of at least one gene near ERBB2, topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A), has been shown to be clinically significant, but the prevailing patterns of gene amplification in this region of chromosome arm 17q have not been studied systematically in clinical cases of breast cancer. For characterizing this region, a commercial ERBB2-containing contig probe and 7 probes prepared from single overlapping BAC and P1 clones lying telomeric to ERBB2 and including TOP2A were hybridized to 77 ERBB2-amplified archival breast tumor specimens from 75 patients. The 7 single-clone probes covered a region of approximately 650 kb starting 114 kb telomeric to ERBB2. Amplification of the ERBB2 contig target alone was found in 32% of the tumors, whereas all 8 probe targets were amplified in 12% of the tumors, based on an amplification criterion of there being more than or equal to 2 targets per chromosome 17 centromere. When one of the 7 overlapping probes encompassing TOP2A indicated amplification within a specimen, all probes telomeric to that probe usually showed amplification. Only 5 specimens had regions of normal or deleted targets separating 2 amplified targets. Also, tumors that showed deletion of TOP2A usually showed deletion of one or more contiguous targets. The observed patterns of amplification and deletion are consistent with the break-fusion-bridge model for gene amplification. TOP2A was amplified in 25% of all tumor specimens and was deleted in 24%, based on a deletion criterion of there being fewer than or equal to 0.75 targets per chromosome 17 centromere.

However, a considerable proportion of breast cancer patients do not respond positively to docetaxel. The mechanisms of docetaxel resistance are poorly understood. Overexpression of ERBB2 occurs in 15-30% of breast tumors and is associated with chemoresistance to a variety of anticancer drugs. In the present study, we sought to identify genes involved in ERBB2-mediated chemoresistance to docetaxel. We generated SAGE libraries from two human mammary cell lines expressing basal (HB4a) and high (C5.2) levels of ERBB2 before and after intensive exposure to docetaxel and identified potential ERBB2 target genes implicated in a variety of cellular processes including cell proliferation, cell adhesion, apoptosis and cytoskeleton organization. Comparison of the transcriptome of the cell lines before and after docetaxel exposure revealed substantially different expression patterns. Twenty-one differentially expressed genes between HB4a and C5.2 cell lines, before and after docetaxel treatment, were further analyzed by qPCR. The alterations in the expression patterns in HB4a and C5.2 cell lines in response to docetaxel treatment observed by SAGE analysis were confirmed by qPCR for the majority of the genes analyzed. Our study provides a comprehensive view of the expression changes induced in two human mammary cells expressing different levels of ERBB2 in response to docetaxel that could contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in ERBB2-mediated chemoresistance in breast cancer.",

Herceptin, a humanized antibody directed to the ErbB2 receptor, has been proven to be effective in the immunotherapy of breast cancer. However, it can result in cardiotoxicity, and a large fraction of breast cancer patients are resistant to Herceptin treatment. We have engineered three novel, fully human, anti-ErbB2 immunoagents: Erbicin, a human single-chain antibody fragment; ERB-hRNase, a human immunoRNase composed of Erbicin fused to a human RNase; ERB-hcAb, a human 'compact' antibody in which two Erbicin molecules are fused to the Fc fragment of a human IgG1. Both ERB-hRNase and ERB-hcAb strongly inhibit the growth of ErbB2-positive cells in vivo. The interactions of the Erbicin-derived immunoagents and Herceptin with the extracellular domain of ErbB2 (ErbB2-ECD) were investigated for the first time by three different methods. Erbicin-derived immunoagents bind soluble extracellular domain with a lower affinity than that measured for the native antigen on tumour cells. Herceptin, by contrast, shows a higher affinity for soluble ErbB2-ECD. Accordingly, ErbB2-ECD abolished the in vitro antitumour activity of Herceptin, with no effect on that of Erbicin-derived immunoagents. These results suggest that the fraction of immunoagent neutralized by free extracellular domain shed into the bloodstream is much higher for Herceptin than for Erbicin-derived immunoagents, which therefore may be used at lower therapeutic doses than those employed for Herceptin.",

        "Doc_abstract":"ErbB2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase whose activity in normal cells depends on dimerization with another ligand-binding ErbB receptor. In contrast, amplification of c-erbB2 in tumors results in dramatic overexpression and constitutive activation of the receptor. Breast cancer cells overexpressing ErbB2 depend on its activity for proliferation, because treatment of these cells with ErbB2-specific antagonistic antibodies or kinase inhibitors blocks tumor cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Intriguingly, loss of ErbB2 signaling is accompanied by a decrease in the phosphotyrosine content of ErbB3. On the basis of these results, it has been proposed that ErbB3 might be a partner for ErbB2 in promoting cellular transformation. To test this hypothesis and directly examine the role of the \"kinase dead\" ErbB3, we specifically ablated its expression with a designer transcription factor (E3). By infection of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells with a retrovirus expressing E3, we show that ErbB3 is an essential partner in the transformation process. Loss of functional ErbB2 or ErbB3 has similar effects on cell proliferation and cell cycle regulators. Furthermore, expression of constitutively active protein kinase B rescues the proliferative block induced as a consequence of loss of ErbB2 or ErbB3 signaling. These results demonstrate that ErbB2 overexpression and activity alone are insufficient to promote breast tumor cell division. Furthermore, we identify ErbB3's role, which is to couple active ErbB2 to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway. Thus, the ErbB2/ErbB3 dimer functions as an oncogenic unit to drive breast tumor cell proliferation.",

Here, we demonstrate that ERBB2 overexpression increases the migration of medulloblastoma cells across basement membranes in vitro. Furthermore, using microarray expression profiling, we show that ERBB2 up-regulates the expression of prometastatic genes in medulloblastoma cells. These include S100A4, which was previously shown to promote metastasis of breast cancer. We demonstrate that S100A4 is a direct target of ERBB2 signaling in medulloblastoma cells via a pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, AKT1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and that levels of ERBB2 and S100A4 are tightly correlated in samples of primary medulloblastoma. Finally, we show that ERBB2-dependent medulloblastoma cell invasion in vitro and prometastatic gene expression in vivo can be blocked using the ERBB tyrosine kinase inhibitor OSI-774.

In this study, we have demonstrated that treatment of different human breast cancer cell lines with honokiol resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent growth inhibition in both estrogen receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer cell lines, as well as in drug-resistant breast cancer cell lines such as adriamycin-resistant and tamoxifen-resistant cell lines. The inhibition of growth was associated with a G1-phase cell cycle arrest and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. The effects of honokiol might be reversely related to the expression level of human epidermal growth receptor 2, (HER-2, also known as erbB2, c-erbB2) since knockdown of her-2 expression by siRNA significantly enhanced the sensitivity of the her-2 over-expressed BT-474 cells to the honokiol-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of HER-2 signalling by specific human epidermal growth receptor 1/HER-2 (EGFR/HER-2) kinase inhibitor lapatinib synergistically enhanced the anti-cancer effects of honokiol in her-2 over-expressed breast cancer cells. Finally, we showed that honokiol was able to attenuate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR (Phosphoinositide 3-kinases/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling by down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation and upregulation of PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin homolog deleted on chromosome Ten) expression.

This group includes nine genes of known function, three previously sequenced genes of relatively uncharacterized function and four novel genes without a match in GenBank. Examination of the previously characterized genes indicates that they represent sequences known to be frequently associated with the malignant phenotype, suggesting that the subtraction cloning strategy used identified appropriate target genes.

In human breast cancer (HBC), erbB-2 protein overexpression has been repeatedly correlated with poor prognosis. In more recent works, underexpression of this gene has been described in HBC. Moreover, it is also recognised that oncogenes that are commonly amplified or deleted encompass point mutations, and some of these are associated with HBC. In cat mammary lesions (CMLs), the overexpression of ERBB2 (27%-59.6%) has also been described, mostly at the protein level and although cat mammary neoplasias are considered to be a natural model of HBC, molecular information is still scarce. In the present work, a cat ERBB2 fragment, comprising exons 10 to 15 (ERBB2_10-15) was achieved for the first time. Allelic variants and genomic haplotype analyses were also performed, and differences between normal and CML populations were observed. Three amino acid changes, corresponding to 3 non-synonymous genomic sequence variants that were only detected in CMLs, were proposed to damage the 3D structure of the protein. We analysed the cat ERBB2 gene at the DNA (copy number determination), mRNA (expression levels assessment) and protein levels (in extra- and intra protein domains) in CML samples and correlated the last two evaluations with clinicopathological features. We found a positive correlation between the expression levels of the ERBB2 RNA and erbB-2 protein, corresponding to the intracellular region. Additionally, we detected a positive correlation between higher mRNA expression and better clinical outcome. Our results suggest that the ERBB2 gene is post-transcriptionally regulated and that proteins with truncations and single point mutations are present in cat mammary neoplastic lesions.

Nevertheless, only a few of them are validated as relevant targets in clinical studies. Estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 expressions could be associated with a level I evidence. Beyond ER and HER2, BRCA and PIK3CA mutations (when targeted with alpha-specific PI3K inhibitors) could be considered as promising targets in breast cancer since they have been associated with objective responses in phase I/II trials. In addition to these four molecular alterations, several others have shown promising results in preclinical studies and are being investigated in clinical trials. These genomic alterations include AKT1, ERBB2, and ESR1 mutations. These considerations highlight the lack of evidence for using multiplex technologies to individualize therapy in metastatic breast cancer. Sequencing multiple genes to treat metastatic breast cancer is very promising but should be done in the context of clinical trials, either to enrich phase I/II trials in patients with genomic alterations or to show medical usefulness of new biotechnologies like next-generation sequencing (NGS). Although most current approaches of precision medicine are aiming at targeting drivers, additional applications could be developed in the future. This includes the identification of DNA repair deficiencies, mechanisms of immune suppression, and identification of minority lethal subclones. Finally, one of the very promising applications of genomics for metastatic breast cancer is the identification of pathway activation or defects at the individual level. For example, gene expression and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) signatures are being developed to detect kinase (such as mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR]/CDK4) activations or DNA repair deficiencies.

Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which Herceptin enhances the antitumor effects of Taxol. Because activation of p34(Cdc2) is required for Taxol-induced apoptosis and because overexpression of ErbB2 blocks Taxol-induced apoptosis by inhibiting p34(Cdc2) activation, we studied the effect of Herceptin treatment on p34(Cdc2) kinase activation and apoptosis in Taxol-treated human breast carcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-435, SKBr3, MDA-MB-453, and 435.eB, which is an ErbB2 transfectant of MDA-MB-435. Herceptin treatment down-regulated ErbB2, reduced the inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2 on Tyr-15, and down-regulated the expression of p21(Cip1), a Cdc2 inhibitor. Herceptin plus Taxol treatment led to higher levels of p34(Cdc2) kinase activity and apoptosis in ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, which is likely attributable to inhibition of Cdc2-Tyr-15 phosphorylation and p21(Cip1) expression. Because significant dephosphorylation of Cdc2-Tyr-15 and down-regulation of p21(Cip1) occur at least 24 h after Herceptin treatment, we investigated whether 24 h Herceptin pretreatment will render ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells more sensitive to Taxol-induced apoptosis compared with the simultaneous treatment of Herceptin plus Taxol. Indeed, Herceptin pretreatment increased Taxol-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity in vitro and more effectively inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts with enhanced in vivo apoptosis. Thus, Herceptin treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing cells can inhibit ErbB2-mediated Cdc2-Tyr-15 phosphorylation and p21(Cip1) up-regulation, which allows effective p34(Cdc2) activation and induction of apoptosis upon Taxol treatment. Herceptin pretreatment renders ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers more susceptible to Taxol-induced cell death, which may have important clinical therapeutic implications.",

Given previous findings that ADA3 is a critical component of HAT complexes that regulate ER function and evidence that overexpression of other ER coactivators such as SRC-3 is associated with clinical outcomes in breast cancer, the current study was designed to assess the potential significance of ADA3 expression/localization in human breast cancer patients. In this study, we analyzed ADA3 expression in breast cancer tissue specimens and assessed the correlation of ADA3 staining with cancer progression and patient outcome. Tissue microarrays prepared from large series of breast cancer patients with long-term follow-ups were stained with anti-ADA3 monoclonal antibody using immunohistochemistry. Samples were analyzed for ADA3 expression followed by correlation with various clinicopathological parameters and patients' outcomes. We report that breast cancer specimens show predominant nuclear, cytoplasmic, or mixed nuclear + cytoplasmic ADA3 staining patterns. Predominant nuclear ADA3 staining correlated with ER+ status. While predominant cytoplasmic ADA3 staining negatively correlated with ER+ status, but positively correlated with ErbB2, EGFR, and Ki67. Furthermore, a positive correlation of cytoplasmic ADA3 was observed with higher histological grade, mitotic counts, Nottingham Prognostic Index, and positive vascular invasion. Patients with nuclear ADA3 and ER positivity have better breast cancer specific survival and distant metastasis free survival. Significantly, cytoplasmic expression of ADA3 showed a strong positive association with reduced BCSS and DMFS in ErbB2+/EGFR+ patients. Although in multivariate analyses ADA3 expression was not an independent marker of survival, predominant nuclear ADA3 staining in breast cancer tissues correlates with ER+ expression and together serves as a marker of good prognosis, whereas predominant cytoplasmic ADA3 expression correlates with ErbB2+/EGFR+ expression and together is a marker of poor prognosis. Thus, ADA3 cytoplasmic localization together with ErbB2+/EGFR+ status may serve as better prognostic marker than individual proteins to predict survival of patients.",

In approximately 5% of breast cancers, ISH assays fail. In these cases, HER2 protein expression is evaluated by IHC alone that may yield false negatives/positives for poor-quality samples. Therefore, we developed a method that was based on quantitative real-time PCR applicable for DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Its limit of detection was determined with breast cancer cell lines and validated with 223 breast cancer patient samples. On the basis of comparisons with fluorescent ISH (FISH) and IHC data, the sensitivity of the new method was 94.2% and 95.1%, its specificity was 100% and 99.1%, and overall concordance between results obtained with the quantitative real-time PCR method and FISH/IHC was 97.6% for both methods. The quantitative real-time PCR method was then used to evaluate the HER2 status of 198 of 3696 breast cancer tissues that yielded indeterminate FISH results. The HER2 copy number was successfully determined in 69.2% of these indeterminate samples. Thus, the DNA-based technique appears to be a specific, sensitive method for determining HER2 copy numbers when the FISH assay fails, which may complement IHC tests. ",

The importance of combined cyclin D1 and ErbB2 overexpression was also analysed. Immunohistochemical analysis of the cyclin D1 expression resulted in 69 (29.8%) weakly positive, 107 (46.5%) moderately positive and 54 (23.7%) strongly positive cases. The prognostic importance of ErbB2 was significantly greater for patients whose tumours overexpressed cyclin D1 than for other patients (p = 0.026). In the former group, ErbB2 overexpression was strongly associated with increased risk of recurrence (RR = 4.7; 95% CI, 2.1-10.4) and breast cancer death (RR = 5.4; 95% CI, 2.3-12.6). This result is in accordance with experimental studies demonstrating a link between cyclin D1 and ErbB2 in oncogenesis. Among oestrogen receptor positive patients, those with moderate cyclin D1 expression significantly did benefit from tamoxifen treatment (RR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82) whereas those with weak or strong expression did not.

The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of statins on breast cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo, and to begin to determine their mechanism of action. We evaluated the effects of statins on breast cancer cell growth, phosphoprotein signaling intermediates, survival/apoptosis regulators, cell cycle regulators, and activated transcription factors. We also examined the in vivo effect of statin administration in a mouse ErbB2(+) breast cancer model. Only lipophilic statins had direct anticancer activity in vitro. Breast cancer cells with activated Ras or ErbB2 pathways seemed to be more sensitive than those overexpressing estrogen receptor, and this correlated with endogenous levels of activated nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Key intermediates regulating cell survival by NF-kappaB activation, as well as cell proliferation by the mitogen activated protein kinase cascade, were among the earliest phosphoproteins influenced by statin treatment. These early effects were followed by declines in activator protein-1 and NF-kappaB activation and concordant changes in other mediators of proliferation and apoptosis. In vivo results showed that oral dosing of statins significantly inhibited the growth of a mouse mammary carcinoma. Lipophilic statins can exert direct anticancer activity in vitro by reducing proliferation and survival signals in susceptible breast cancer phenotypes. Tumor growth inhibition in vivo using a clinically relevant statin dose also seems to be associated with reduced tumor cell proliferation and survival. These findings provide supporting rationale for future statin trials in breast cancer patients.",

One such adaptive pathway is the unfolded protein (UPR) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response mediated in part by the ER-localized transmembrane sensor IRE1 (ref. 2) and its substrate XBP1 (ref. 3). Previous studies report UPR activation in various human tumours, but the role of XBP1 in cancer progression in mammary epithelial cells is largely unknown. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)--a form of breast cancer in which tumour cells do not express the genes for oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 (also called ERBB2 or NEU)--is a highly aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options. Here we report that XBP1 is activated in TNBC and has a pivotal role in the tumorigenicity and progression of this human breast cancer subtype. In breast cancer cell line models, depletion of XBP1 inhibited tumour growth and tumour relapse and reduced the CD44(high)CD24(low) population. Hypoxia-inducing factor 1α (HIF1α) is known to be hyperactivated in TNBCs. Genome-wide mapping of the XBP1 transcriptional regulatory network revealed that XBP1 drives TNBC tumorigenicity by assembling a transcriptional complex with HIF1α that regulates the expression of HIF1α targets via the recruitment of RNA polymerase II. Analysis of independent cohorts of patients with TNBC revealed a specific XBP1 gene expression signature that was highly correlated with HIF1α and hypoxia-driven signatures and that strongly associated with poor prognosis. Our findings reveal a key function for the XBP1 branch of the UPR in TNBC and indicate that targeting this pathway may offer alternative treatment strategies for this aggressive subtype of breast cancer.",

They need to be better clarified to determine proper treatment and prognosis.;To elaborate the clinicopathological features of molecular subtypes of breast cancers in Indonesian women.;A retrospective cross-sectional study of 84 paraffin-embedded tissues of breast cancer samples from Dr. Sardjito General Hospital in Central Java, Indonesia was performed. Expression of ER, PR, Her-2 and Ki-67 was analyzed to classify molecular subtypes of breast cancer by immunohistochemistry. The relation of clinicopathological features of breast cancers with molecular subtypes of luminal A, luminal B, Her-2 and triple negative/basal-like were analyzed using Pearson's Chi-Square test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.;Case frequency of luminal A, Luminal B, Her-2+ and triple negative/basal-like subtypes were 38.1%, 16.7%, 20.2% and 25%, respectively. Significant difference was found in breast cancer molecular subtypes in regard to age, histological grade, lymph node status and staging. However it showed insignificant result in regard to tumor size. Luminal A subtype of breast cancer was commonly found in >50 years old women (p:0.028), low grade cancer (p:0.09), negative lymph node metastasis (p:0.034) and stage III (p:0.017). Eventhough the difference was insignificant, luminal A subtype breast cancer was mostly found in small size breast cancer (p:0.129). Her-2+ subtype breast cancer was more commonly diagnosed with large size, positive lymph node metastasis and poor grade.

Many studies have been devoted to the identification and characterization of mutations that occur frequently during breast tumorigenesis. The major types of genetic abnormalities that are frequently observed in breast tumors are amplification of protooncogenes (MYC, ERBB2) and DNA from chromosome band 11q13; mutation of TP53; and loss of heterozygosity from chromosomes and chromosome arms 1, 3p, 6q, 7q, 8p, 11, 13q, 16q, 17, 18q, and 22q. The latter may correspond to losses or inactivations of tumor suppressor genes. Recently, linkage analyses of large families with a predisposition to breast cancer have been performed in order to map breast cancer susceptibility genes (TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2). The findings have thrown light on the molecular mechanisms of breast cancer and have enabled various genetic markers to be used in clinical oncology.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In breast cancer, the predominant genetic mechanism for oncogene activation is through an amplification of a gene. The HER-2 (also known as ErbB2/c-erbB2/HER-2/neu) oncogene is the most frequently amplified oncogene in breast cancer, and its overexpression is associated with poor clinical outcome. In addition to its important role in breast cancer growth and progression, HER-2 is also a target for a new form of chemotherapy. Breast cancer patients have been treated with considerable success since 1998 with trastuzumab, a recombinant antibody designed to block signaling through HER-2 receptor. HER-2 has also been implicated in altering the chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells to different forms of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, particularly of topoII-inhibitors (e.g., anthracyclines). Topoisomerase IIalpha gene is located just by the HER-2 oncogene at the chromosome 17q12-q21 and is amplified or deleted in almost 90% of the HER-2 amplified primary breast tumors. Recent data suggests that amplification and deletion of topoisomerase IIalpha may account for both relative chemosensitivity and resistance to anthracycline therapy, depending on the specific genetic defect at the topoIIalpha locus. Expanding our understanding of HER-2 amplification also changes its role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. HER-2 is an oncogene that clearly can drive tumor induction and growth and is also a target for a new kind of chemotherapy, but its function as a marker for chemoselection may be due to associated genetic changes, of which topoisomerase IIalpha is a good example. Moreover, despite potential evidence that genes other than HER-2, such as topoisomerase IIalpha, may be more important predictors of therapeutic response in breast cancer, HER-2 status still has a very significant role in therapeutic selection, mainly as the major criterion for administering trastuzumab in treating breast cancer. Thus, the clinical and therapeutic importance of the HER-2 and topoisomerase IIalpha status to breast cancer management should only increase in the next few years.",

Trastuzumab, which is thought to act, at least in part, by downregulating ErbB2 expression is only effective in approximately 30-40% of ErbB2 positive breast tumors. Geldanamycin and its derivative 17-AAG are potential antitumor agents capable of downregulating client proteins of Hsp90, including ErbB2. To investigate the ability of 17-AAG to downregulate ErbB2 in trastuzumab resistant breast cancer cells and the possibility of 17-AAG and trastuzumab potentiating each other's effect, the recently established trastuzumab resistant breast cancer cell line, JIMT-1 was compared to the known trastuzumab sensitive SKBR-3 line. Baseline and stimulus-evoked dimerization and activation levels of ErbB2, and the effects of trastuzumab and 17-AAG alone and in combination on cell proliferation and apoptosis, as well as on ErbB2 expression and phosphorylation have been measured. Baseline activation and amenability to activation and downregulation by trastuzumab was much lower in the resistant line. However, 17-AAG enhanced ErbB2 homodimerization after 5-10 min of treatment in both cell lines, and decreased proliferation with an IC50 of 70 nM for SKBR-3 and 10nM for JIMT-1. Thus, 17-AAG may be a useful drug in trastuzumab resistant ErbB2 overexpressing tumors. The antiproliferative effect of 17-AAG was positively correlated with phosphorylation and downregulation of ErbB2 and was dominated by apoptosis, although, especially at higher doses, necrosis was also present. Interestingly, IC50 values for ErbB2 downregulation and phosphorylation, in the 30-40 nM range, were not significantly different for the two cell lines. This observation and the negative correlation between resting ErbB2 levels and the antiproliferative effect of 17-AAG may indicate that activation of ErbB2 to some extent could counteract the overall cytostatic effect, especially at higher levels of ErbB2 expression. The usual therapeutic dose of trastuzumab did not change the IC50 of 17-AAG on the proliferation of either cell line, but nevertheless decreased overall ErbB2 phosphorylation and at low doses of 17-AAG further decreased cell growth in the sensitive SKBR-3, thus trastuzumab may be a good combination partner to counteract undesired activating effects of 17-AAG.",

Heregulin leads to dramatic clusters of ErbB3 that contain some ErbB2 and EGFR and abundant PI 3-kinase. Other docking proteins, such as Shc and STAT5, respond differently to receptor activation.

One such candidate, the scaffolding adapter protein, GRB2-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2), functions in ErbB signaling and was recently shown to enhance mammary epithelial cell proliferation, and metastasis of ERBB2 (HER2/neu)-driven murine breast cancer. However, the amplification status and function of GAB2 in the context of amplification remain undefined. In this study, by genomic profiling of 172 breast tumors, and fluorescence in situ hybridization validation in an independent set of 210 scorable cases, we observed focal amplification spanning GAB2 (11q14.1) independent of CCND1 (11q13.2) amplification, consistent with a driver role. Further, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of GAB2 in breast cancer lines (SUM52, SUM44PE and MDA468) with GAB2 amplification revealed a dependency on GAB2 for cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, survival and invasion, likely mediated through altered phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. GAB2 knockdown also reduced proliferation and survival in a cell line (BT474) with ERBB2 amplification, consistent with the possibility that GAB2 can function downstream of ERBB2. Our studies implicate focal amplification of GAB2 in breast carcinogenesis, and underscore an oncogenic role of scaffolding adapter proteins, and a potential new point of therapeutic intervention.",

In human breast cancer cells with Her-2/neu overexpression, which usually are more resistance to anti-cancer drugs than cells without Her-2/ neu overexpression, may be sensitized through E1A-mediated downregulation of Her-2/neu. Alternatively, E1A can induce sensitization to anticancer drugs in cancer cells or normal diploid fibroblast cells through upregulating the expression of caspase proenzymes, or downregulating the activity of a critical survival factor Akt and/or upregulating the activities of a pro-apoptotic kinase p38 and a protein phosphatase PP2A, etc. This review summarizes these progresses and proposes a plausible feed-forward model for E1A-mediated chemosensitization in human breast cancer cells.",

Today, patients eligible for trastuzumab are selected using HER2 expression/amplification status of the primary tumor. However, acquired and inherent resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in these patients poses a significant challenge, and better patient stratification will be needed to improve clinical response. Here, we provide a wide-ranging overview of potential biomarkers capable of stratifying patients regarding their response to trastuzumab. These include HER2 amplification, impaired access to the binding site (p95HER2, Δ16HER-2, MUC4), augmented signaling through other ERBB family receptors (HER1, HER3, HER4) and their ligands, activation of HER2 targets by alternate heterodimers (EphA2, IGF-1R, GDF15, MUC1*), signaling triggered by downstream members (PIK3CA, PTEN, SRC, mTOR), altered expression of cell cycle and apoptotic regulators (CDKs, p27(kip1), Bcl-2), hormone receptor status, resistance to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (FcγR), and altered miRNA expression signatures. Multigenic molecular profile analyses have revealed further genes not directly associated with classical oncogenic pathways. Although numerous biomarkers have shown promise in pre-clinical studies, many have delivered controversial results when evaluated in clinical trials. One of the keys for targeting ERBB2 will be to consider the entire ERBB family and downstream associated pathways responsible for the malignant transformation. The heterogeneity of the disease is likely to represent a significant obstacle to accurately predicting the course of resistance. The future most probably involves the incorporation of multiple biomarkers into a unified predictor enabling selection of patients for superior targeted drug administration. ",

However, a detailed understanding is required to target desensitized pathways and mechanisms for successful reactivation as part of a tailored therapy. To gain insight, which malfunctions contribute to chemoresistance, two mechanisms relevant for tissue homeostasis, the regulation of the cell cycle and of apoptosis, were investigated. Maternal MCF-7- and ErbB2-overexpressing MCF-7(erbB2) breast cancer cells were long term pretreated with 2'-deoxy-5-fluorodeoxyuridine (5-FdUrd) or 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (AraC) and the acquisition of drug-insensitivity was analyzed. A phosphate-conjugated heterodinucleoside consisting of one 5-FdUrd- and one AraC-moiety (5-fluoro-2'-desoxyuridylyl-(3'-->5')-Arabinocytidine) was utilized as a tool to assess the type of acquired resistances. ErbB2-overexpression disrupted proper cell cycle regulation and furthermore facilitated the development of an apoptosis-refractory phenotype upon exposure to 5-FdUrd. Experiments with dimer 5-FdUrd-araC in ErbB2-overexpressing MCF-7(erbB2) cells, and also with nucleoside 5-FdUrd in maternal MCF-7 cells, evidenced that the phenotypes of resistance to cell cycle inhibition and to apoptosis induction were differently affected. The expression profile of cyclin D1 (but not that of p53, p21, or p27) correlated with the proliferative phenotypes and nuclear accumulation of apoptosis inducing factor (but not activation of caspase 7) with apoptotic phenotypes. Dimer 5-FdUrd-araC overrode acquired chemoresistances, whereas combined application of 5-FdUrd and AraC exhibited significantly less activity. Dimer 5-FdUrd-araC remained active in MCF-7 clones most likely by circumventing the prerequisite of first-step phosphorylation. The acquisition of chemoresistance encompassed the affection of apoptosis- and cell-cycle regulation to, respectively, different extents. Thus, drug-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction are independent of each other.",

All of the detected ERBB2 mutations except for one in-frame deletion mutation were missense mutations. Of the 16 ERBB2 mutations detected, 4 affected Val777 in the exon 20 site, and 3 affected Leu755 in the exon 19 site. We simultaneously analyzed the somatic mutations of EGFR, K-RAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF genes in the 16 samples with ERBB2 mutations, and found that all of the 3 colorectal carcinoma samples with ERBB2 mutations harbored K-RAS mutations.;This study showed that in addition to lung adenocarcinomas, ERBB2 kinase domain mutation occurs in other common human cancers such as gastric, breast, and colorectal cancers, and suggested that alterations of ERBB2-mediated signaling pathway by ERBB2 mutations alone or together with K-RAS mutations may contribute to the development of human cancers.",

Lapatinib is the first dual inhibitor of HER1 (EGFR, ErbB1) and HER2 (ErbB2, Neu) tyrosine kinases to be used in clinical practice. However, only HER2 is currently used for therapy indications and new predictors for the treatment with lapatinib are sought.;This minireview focuses on lapatinib and its role in breast cancer treatment. Preclinical and clinical studies as well as pharmacological characteristics are briefly reviewed while the focus is on efficacy assessment including predictive factors for therapy outcome.;Lapatinib (Tykerb/Tyverb) was Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in 2007 for use in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of HER2-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer in patients who had received previous treatment (including anthracycline, taxane and trastuzumab containing regimens) and in 2010 for use in combination with letrozole for postmenopausal women with hormonal receptor positive and HER2- positive metastatic breast cancer. In contrast to trastuzumab (Herceptin), lapatinib is orally administered and it targets both HER2 and HER1 receptors. As a synthetic and oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), it is convenient, cheaper and easier to produce than monoclonal antibodies. The recommended dosage is not dependent on body weight either. Lapatinib plasma level measurement could be an approach to tailored therapy for further optimizing the dose and prolonging this efficient therapy. New lapatinib response predictors are being evaluated. At this time, only HER2 amplification/overexpression is used to choose lapatinib therapy candidates. Further studies on concurrent HER1 fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)/immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessment and/or microarray analyses may produce new data on the predictive role of the HER1 (EGFR) gene/protein. PTEN loss and PIK3CA gene mutations are other markers that may predict lapatinib poor response.",

Dysregulation of several microRNAs (miRNAs) plays a key role in breast cancer progression and metastasis. In this study, we screened and identified miRNAs dysregualted in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Our molecular study demonstrated that miR-489 was specifically downregulated by the HER2-downstream signaling, especially through the MAPK pathway. Restoration or overexpression of miR-489 in HER2-positive breast cancer cells significantly inhibited cell growth in vitro and decreased the tumorigenecity and tumor growth in xenograft mice. Mechanistically, we found that overexpression of miR-489 led to the decreased levels of HER2 and SHP2 and thus attenuated HER2-downstream signaling. Furthermore, we for the first time demonstrated that HER2 is a direct target of miR-489 and therefore HER2-SHP2-MAPK and miR-489 signaling pathways form a mutually inhibitory loop. Using quantitative real-time PCR analysis and Fluorescent in situ hybridization technique (FISH), we found that miR-489 was expressed at significantly lower level in tumor tissues compared to the adjacent normal tissues. Downregulation of miR-489 in breast cancers was associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes. Overall, our results define a double-negative feedback loop involving miR-489 and the HER2-SHP2-MAPK signaling axis that can regulate breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor progression and might have therapeutic relevance for HER2-positive breast cancer.

To that end, this study evaluated ERBB2 status using two different FDA-approved in-situ hybridization methods and an FDA-approved immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay in the largest cohort to date (n=84) of invasive breast carcinomas with tracked cold ischemia time. Cold ischemia time was stratified into four groups (<1 h (n=45), 1-2 h (n=27), 2-3 h (n=6), and >3 h (n=6)) and ERBB2 status was evaluated in each group by IHC (4B5) and by in-situ hybridization methodologies (PathVysion(®) fluorescence in situ hybridization and the INFORM HER2(®) dual in situ DNA probe assay). Both in-situ hybridization methods were evaluated using three ERBB2 scoring criteria (dual-probe guidelines, single-probe guidelines, and the FDA package insert scoring instructions). Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and INFORM HER2(®) demonstrated 100% concordance in the detection of ERBB2 amplification by all three scoring guidelines at all cold ischemia time points. Agreement between in-situ hybridization methodologies and IHC was superior using single-probe guidelines compared with dual probe or FDA scoring instructions. In addition, Inform HER2(®) in-situ hybridization signals were significantly more intense than FISH at all cold ischemia time points, however, no significant loss of either chromosome 17 or ERBB2 signal was detected by FISH or Inform HER2(®) in-situ hybridization in cold ischemia times up to 3 h.

Here, we show that autocrine motility factor (AMF) binds to HER2 and induces cleavage to the ectodomain-deleted and constitutively active form p95HER2. Mechanistic investigations indicated that interaction of AMF with HER2 triggers HER2 phosphorylation and metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding, activating phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and ablating the ability of trastuzumab to inhibit breast carcinoma cell growth. Furthermore, we found that HER2 expression and AMF secretion were inversely related in breast carcinoma cells. On the basis of this evidence that AMF may contribute to HER2-mediated breast cancer progression, our findings suggest that AMF-HER2 interaction might be a novel target for therapeutic management of patients with breast cancer, whose disease is resistant to trastuzumab.",

Treatment of NeuYD or NeuYD x VEGF mice with rapamycin dramatically inhibited tumor growth accompanied by a marked decrease in tumor vascularization. Two key events that may underlie the antitumor activity of rapamycin were decreased expression of ErbB3 and inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor-1-dependent responses to hypoxic stress. Rapamycin exposure caused only a modest inhibition of the proliferation of tumor-derived cell lines in standard monolayer cultures, but dramatically inhibited the growth of the same cells in three-dimensional cultures, due in part to the induction of apoptotic cell death.

The prognostic biomarkers chosen for comparison represented surrogate measures of tumor: (i). proliferation, growth and genetic instability (mitotic and apoptotic indices, Ki-67/MIB-1-positivity, nuclear grade, p53-positivity), (ii). endocrine-dependence (estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), pS2, Bcl2), (iii). growth factor receptor-dependence (ErbB2, EGFR/ErbB1), and (iv). angiogenic, invasive and proteolytic potential (uPA, PAI-1, Cathepsin D, VEGF). No biomarker reflecting tumor angiogenic, invasive or proteolytic potential showed a significant correlation with patient age at diagnosis. In contrast, significant inverse correlations (|r|>0.1; P< or =0.05) were observed for all measures of tumor growth and genetic instability as well as growth factor receptor overexpression (ErbB2 or EGFR positivity). Only one marker of endocrine-dependence, ER expression, showed a significant positive correlation with patient age at diagnosis. In summary, these findings support the hypothesis that breast cancer biology is significantly affected by patient age. In particular, breast tumors arising in older patients have slower growth rates, are more likely to be ER-positive, and are less likely to be p53-positive, EGFR-positive or ErbB2-positive.",

Since ERBB3 lacks intrinsic kinase activity, signal transduction occurs through formation of heterodimers with EGFR, ERBB2, and ERBB4. ERBB3 is a signaling specialist since it has six binding sites for the p85 SH2 adapter subunit of phosphoinositide 3' kinases. These lipid kinases coordinate regulation of metabolism, cell size, proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Not surprisingly, ERBB3 signaling has been linked to cancer etiology and progression. In breast cancer, the partnership of ERBB2 and ERBB3 may be crucial for the aggressive properties of cancers with ERBB2 amplification, and may contribute to pre-existing and acquired resistance to therapy. This partnership creates opportunities for improving efficacy of ERBB-targeted pharmaceuticals, by interfering with coupling of ERBB2 to ERBB3 through dimerization inhibitors, and by use of therapeutic compounds that target AKT-dependent pathways activated through ERBB3. Additional therapeutic opportunities may be identified through better understanding of how ERBBs are regulated and deployed in normal mammary gland processes. Work using mouse models has identified the main processes regulated by each of the four ERBBs, which has practical implications in understanding breast cancer etiology, and eventual development of better prognostic, predictive, and therapeutic tools.",

Oestrogen receptor (ER) positive tumour-derived cell lines are known to express relatively low levels of ERBB2 protein under oestrogenic conditions, but markedly higher levels following withdrawal of oestrogens or administration of tamoxifen. Expression of the closely related ERBB3 gene, which co-operates with ERBB2 in cellular transformation, is now shown to respond to oestrogenic manipulation in a similar way, both responses being mediated largely by transcriptional changes. Six previously undescribed DNase I hypersensitive sites occur within the first intron of ERBB2 in cells that overexpress the gene. A 409 base pair DNA fragment containing one of these sites conferred ER dependent oestrogen inhibition on the ERBB2 promoter in two types of transient transfection assay. DNase I footprinting revealed four separate transcription factor binding sites within this fragment consistent with a role as a transcriptional enhancer. These findings implicate intron 1 sequences in the control of ERBB2 expression for the first time and demonstrate that one site within this region is involved in mediating the transcriptional response to oestrogens. Additionally, there is likely to be synergism between ERBB2 and ERBB3 signalling when both are overexpressed in response to oestrogen inhibition, thereby driving transformed cell behaviour.",

A subsequent histological and immunohistochemical study including 12 additional cases of Cowden disease breast carcinomas was performed to confirm the microarray data.;Unsupervised clustering of the 74 familial tumors followed the intrinsic gene classification of breast cancer except for a group of five tumors that included the three Cowden tumors. The gene expression profile of the Cowden tumors shows considerable overlap with that of a breast cancer subgroup known as molecular apocrine breast carcinoma, which is suspected to have increased androgenic signaling and shows frequent ERBB2 amplification in sporadic tumors. The histological and immunohistochemical study showed that several cases had apocrine histological features and expressed GGT1, which is a potential new marker for apocrine breast carcinoma.;These data suggest that activation of the ERBB2-PI3K-AKT pathway by loss of PTEN at early stages of tumorigenesis promotes the formation of breast tumors with apocrine features.",

Molecular apocrine is a subtype of ER-negative breast cancer that is characterized by the overexpression of steroid-response genes such as AR and a high rate of ErbB2 amplification. In this study, we have identified a positive feedback loop between the AR and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways in molecular apocrine breast cancer. In this process, AR regulates ERK phosphorylation and kinase activity. In addition, AR inhibition results in the down-regulation of ERK target proteins phospho-RSK1, phospho-Elk-1, and c-Fos using an in vivo molecular apocrine model. Furthermore, we show that AR-mediated induction of ERK requires ErbB2, and AR activity, in turn, regulates ErbB2 expression as an AR target gene. These findings suggest that ErbB2 is an upstream connector between the AR and ERK signaling pathways. Another feature of this feedback loop is an ERK-mediated regulation of AR. In this respect, the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation reduces AR expression and CREB1-mediated transcriptional regulation of AR acts as a downstream connector between the AR and ERK signaling pathways in molecular apocrine cells. Finally, we demonstrate that AR-positive staining is associated with the overexpression of ERK signaling targets phospho-Elk-1 and c-Fos in ER-negative breast tumors, which further supports a cross-regulation between the AR and ERK signaling pathways in molecular apocrine subtype. This study demonstrates an AR-ERK feedback loop in ER-negative breast cancer with significant biologic and therapeutic implications in this disease.",

NGAL levels varied in these tumors from undetectable to exceeding those in normal breast parenchyma. Immuno-histochemical analysis confirmed the presence of NGAL within breast carcinoma cells but detected only low levels of this protein in normal ductal epithelium. In contrast, large amounts of the protein were localized to the lumen of normal breast ducts in the vicinity of NGAL-expressing tumors. Interestingly, unlike NRL in rat mammary carcinomas, no significant association between NGAL expression and HER-2/neu activation was found in human breast tumors. In contrast, a significant correlation between NGAL expression in breast cancer was found with several other markers of poor prognosis, including estrogen and progesterone receptor-negative status and high proliferation (S-phase fraction).

With the use of gene microarrays, different subtypes of breast cancer have been characterized. The basal subtype is characterized by high expression of keratins 5 and 17, laminin, and fatty acid-binding protein 7. The ERBB2+ subtype is characterized by high expression of genes in the ERBB2 amplicon. The luminal A subtype is characterized by the highest expression of the ER alpha gene. The luminal B and C subtypes have a lower expression of the ER cluster. The importance of these different subtypes lies in the fact that they differ in clinical outcome, with the basal and ERBB2+ subtypes having the worse prognosis and the luminal A group having the best prognosis. Different strategies for evaluating tumors in a clinical setting have been developed. Two such strategies are the 21-gene assay (Oncotype DX; Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA), which is currently in commercial use in the United States, and the 70-gene assay, which has been developed by a group in the Netherlands. These assays have been shown to predict clinical outcome and response to therapy. However, to date these gene assays have not been studied in a prospective manner. Over the next year, prospective clinical trials will be initiated using these predictive tools in the treatment of breast cancer. In the near future, clinical decisions will most likely be dictated by the genetic characteristics of the tumor, with the clinical characteristics becoming less important.

        "Doc_abstract":"Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy in many industrialized countries. Approximately one fourth of all women diagnosed with early breast cancer present with tumors that are characterized by erbB2 amplification. While the associated Her-2/neu receptor overexpression results in a high risk of relapse and poor prognosis, these tumors also represent a target for a selective monoclonal antibody therapy with trastuzumab (Herceptin). The combination of trastuzumab with chemotherapy has led to a considerable reduction of recurrences and to a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality both in the adjuvant and metastatic setting. Unfortunately, despite Her-2/neu overexpression, not all patients equally benefit from trastuzumab treatment, and almost all women with metastatic breast cancer eventually progress during antibody therapy. Moreover, trastuzumab is burdened with cardiotoxicity, thus increasing the risk of symptomatic congestive heart failure. In addition, the marginal costs for a 1 year therapy of trastuzumab-based therapy, which is currently considered to be the most effective treatment regimen in the adjuvant setting, may amount for up to US$ 40.000. Testing for erbB2 oncogene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), respectively, and staining for Her-2/neu receptor overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) represent the current standard for determining patient eligibility for trastuzumab-based therapy. However, while the negative predictive value of these assays for predicting the absence of benefit from trastuzumab-based therapy is sufficiently high, their positive predictive value remains insufficient, i.e. only a proportion of patients selected by these tests substantially benefit from trastuzumab-containing regimen. Accordingly, over the last years a number of biomarkers have been evaluated in their potential to predict response to trastuzumab-based therapies. These include markers auf activation of Her-2/neu (e.g., tyrosine phosphorylated Her-2/neu in tissue and cleaved Her-2/neu extracellular domain in serum) and its dimerization partners (e.g., EGFR), respectively, but also components of Her-2/neu-induced downstream signaling pathways that are crucial for the growth inhibitory effects of trastuzumab (e.g., PTEN and PI3K). Other parameters, such as topoisomerase-II alpha and c-myc co-amplifications, have also been identified as potentially useful predictors of response to trastuzumab-based chemotherapy regimen. While the benefit of these predictive biomarkers in the metastatic setting is currently explored, their usefulness in the adjuvant setting is still largely unknown. It is, however, undisputable that, within the group of Her-2/neu overexpressing tumors, further response predictors are needed in order to minimize trastuzumab-associated side effects, and to reduce the considerable societal costs that are associated with trastuzumab-based treatment regimen.",

The patients were strati ed into: ER-, PR- and Her-2 neu- (Arm A, n=47) and ER+, PgR+ and Her-2 neu+ (Arm B, n=38).;TN subtype had higher numbers of premenopausal and advanced stage patients as compared to TP subtype. The locoregional recurrence (LRR) and distant metastatic rate was also higher in TN subtype but there was no de nite pattern in both the arms. Among the prognostic factors, patients with premenopausal status and advanced stage in TN breast cancer had inferior survival (P=0.07) whereas for those with postmenopausal status and early stage there was no survival difference between the two arms.;TN subtype tends to be more aggressive in terms of younger age and advanced stage at presentation, higher tumour grade, LRR and metastasis, suggesting need for future research efforts on providing aggressive treatment to these patients. We could attribute better outcome for TP subtype to receptor positivity enabling role of hormonal treatment and targeted therapy, although less number of patients received targeted therapy.",

The markers were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in specimens of 50 patients with primary or metastatic breast cancer. Positive rates of ER were significantly (p = 0.002) higher in primary versus relapsed/metastatic breast cancer (70 vs. 38 %, respectively). The VEGF positive expression rates were also significantly higher in primary versus metastatic cancer (82 vs. 38 %, respectively; p < 0.001). By contrast, positive rates of HER-2 and COX-2 were not significantly different between different types of cancer. COX-2 correlated with HER-2 expression in both primary and relapsed/metastatic focuses of breast cancer. COX-2 also correlated with VEGF expression in primary breast cancer. Expressions of ER, PR, HER2, and COX-2 did not correlate between primary and relapsed/metastatic breast cancers, indicating that the treatment decision should be made according to the status of these markers in relapsed/metastatic focuses. The total change rates of ER, PR, HER-2, COX-2, and VEGF were 26, 18, 10, 30, and 58 %, respectively. In conclusion, HER-2 and COX-2, along with VEGF, appear to play a role in the development and progression of breast cancer. In addition, all of the studied markers may serve as indicators of prognosis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Overexpression of ErbB2, a receptor-like tyrosine kinase, is shared by several types of human carcinomas. In breast tumors the extent of overexpression has a prognostic value, thus identifying the oncoprotein as a target for therapeutic strategies. Already, antibodies to ErbB2 are used in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of metastasizing breast cancer. The mechanisms underlying the oncogenic action of ErbB2 involve a complex network in which ErbB2 acts as a ligand-less signaling subunit of three other receptors that directly bind a large repertoire of stroma-derived growth factors. The major partners of ErbB2 in carcinomas are ErbB1 (also called EGFR) and ErbB3, a kinase-defective receptor whose potent mitogenic action is activated in the context of heterodimeric complexes. Why ErbB2-containing heterodimers are relatively oncopotent is a function of a number of processes. Apparently, these heterodimers evade normal inactivation processes, by decreasing the rate of ligand dissociation, internalizing relatively slowly and avoiding the degradative pathway by returning to the cell surface. On the other hand, the heterodimers strongly recruit survival and mitogenic pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinases and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Hyper-activated signaling through the ErbB-signaling network results in dysregulation of the cell cycle homeostatic machinery, with upregulation of active cyclin-D/CDK complexes. Recent data indicate that cell cycle regulators are also linked to chemoresistance in ErbB2-dependent breast carcinoma. Together with D-type cyclins, it seems that the CDK inhibitor p21waf1 plays an important role in evasion from apoptosis. These recent findings herald a preliminary understanding of the output layer which connects elevated ErbB-signaling to oncogenesis and chemoresistance.",

Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) was used to identify significant copy number alterations (CNAs) in HER2+ tumors, which were related to a set of 554 non-HER2 amplified (HER2-) breast tumors. High-resolution oligonucleotide aCGH was used to delineate the 17q12-q21 region in high detail.;The HER2-amplicon was narrowed to an 85.92 kbp region including the TCAP, PNMT, PERLD1, HER2, C17orf37 and GRB7 genes, and higher HER2 copy numbers indicated worse prognosis. In 31% of HER2+ tumors the amplicon extended to TOP2A, defining a subgroup of HER2+ breast cancer associated with estrogen receptor-positive status and with a trend of better survival than HER2+ breast cancers with deleted (18%) or neutral TOP2A (51%). HER2+ tumors were clearly distinguished from HER2- tumors by the presence of recurrent high-level amplifications and firestorm patterns on chromosome 17q. While there was no significant difference between HER2+ and HER2- tumors regarding the incidence of other recurrent high-level amplifications, differences in the co-amplification pattern were observed, as shown by the almost mutually exclusive occurrence of 8p12, 11q13 and 20q13 amplification in HER2+ tumors. GISTIC analysis identified 117 significant CNAs across all autosomes. Supervised analyses revealed: (1) significant CNAs separating HER2+ tumors stratified by clinical variables, and (2) CNAs separating HER2+ from HER2- tumors.;We have performed a comprehensive survey of CNAs in HER2+ breast tumors, pinpointing significant genomic alterations including both known and potentially novel therapeutic targets.

Characteristics of women with and without lobulitis were cross-classified with categories of clinical, pathologic, and histologic characteristics, and differences in distributions were tested in univariate and multivariate analysis. Lobulitis was found in 26 (8%) of 334 patients. The lymphocytic infiltrate was predominantly T-cell type. In a multivariate model, lobulitis in patients with breast cancer was significantly associated with younger age, triple (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2)-negative cancers, and medullary phenotypes.

This empiric observation is seen as paradoxical given that the cardiomyocyte is considered to be a terminally differentiated cell. Despite the fact that these cells do not divide after birth, adult cardiomyocytes may become \"innocent bystander\" targets of anticancer drugs designed to interfere with cell signaling pathways in rapidly proliferating cells. In breast cancer clinical trials, treatment with the erbB2 receptor antibody trastuzumab combined with anthracyclines has been associated with an increased risk for the development of cardiac pump failure. Trastuzumab/anthracycline cardiomyopathy may be the first clinically significant cardiotoxicity to emerge from signal transduction therapeutics. The erbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is known to have a critical role in cardiac development. In addition, erbB2 is thought to participate in an important pathway for growth, repair, and survival of adult cardiomyocytes as part of a signaling network that involves neuregulins and the neuregulin receptor erbB4. However, erbB2 levels in the adult heart are low when compared with the levels found in erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells that are the intended targets of trastuzumab therapy. Thus, trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity must be explained by some alternative mechanism. After confirming that trastuzumab is capable of inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of the human cardiomyocyte erbB2 protein, a novel system for culturing human myocardium was developed in our laboratory. We used this system to study the effects of trastuzumab on human cardiomyocytes in vitro and observed trastuzumab-induced structural and functional changes in human cardiomyocytes that were at least partially reversible with the addition of recombinant neuregulins. The results obtained in these experiments support a direct action of trastuzumab on human cardiomyocytes. In addition, these data provide insight regarding potential molecular mechanisms. Most importantly, these data draw attention to the inherent risk of cardiotoxicity associated with a newly emerging class of antineoplastic drugs that interfere with signal transduction pathways.",

Although much work has focused on the role of these growth factor receptors in the differentiation of a variety of tissues, there is little information in regards to normal stromal cells. We investigated erbB2 expression in the murine fibroblast cell line Swiss 3T3L1, which naturally or hormonally induced undergoes adipocyte differentiation. We found that the Swiss 3T3-L1 fibroblasts express erbB2, in addition to EGFR, and in a quantity comparable to or even greater than the breast cancer cell line T47D. Proliferating cells increased erbB2 and EGFR levels when reaching confluence up to 4- and 10-fold, respectively. This expression showed a significant decrease when growth-arrested cells were stimulated to differentiate with dexamethasone and isobutyl-methylxanthine. Differentiated cells presented a decreased expression of both erbB2 and EGFR regardless of whether the cells were hormonally or spontaneously differentiated. EGF stimulation of serum-starved cells increased erbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation and retarded erbB2 migration in SDS-PAGE, suggesting receptor association and activation. Heregulin-alpha1 and -beta1, two EGF related factors, had no effect on erbB2 or EGFR phosphorylation. Although 3T3-L1 cells expressed heregulin, its specific receptors, erbB3 and erbB4, were not found. This is the first time in which erbB2 is reported to be expressed in an adipocytic cell line which does not depend on non EGF family growth factors (thyroid hormone, growth hormone, etc.) to accomplish adipose differentiation. Since erbB2 and EGFR expression were downmodulated as differentiation progressed it is conceivable that a mechanism of switching from a mitogenic to a differentiating signaling pathway may be involved, through regulation of the expression of these growth factor receptors.",

Here, we have investigated whether, by targeting PI3K, betaGBP has therapeutic efficacy in aggressive breast cancer cells where strong mitogenic input is fuelled by overexpression of the ErbB2 (also known as HER/neu, for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) oncoprotein receptor and have used immortalised ductal cells and non-aggressive mammary cancer cells, which express ErbB2 at low levels, as controls.;Aggressive BT474 and SKBR3 cancer cells where ErbB2 is overexpressed, MCF10A immortalised ductal cells and non-invasive MCF-7 cancer cells which express low levels of ErbB2, both in their naive state and when forced to mimic aggressive behaviour, were used. Class IA PI3K was immunoprecipitated and the conversion of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-biphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) assessed by ELISA. The consequences of PI3K inhibition by betaGBP were analysed at proliferation level, by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, by akt gene expression and by apoptosis. Apoptosis was documented by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, alteration of the plasma membrane, caspase 3 activation and DNA fragmentation. Phosphorylated and total ERK were measured by Western blot analysis and akt mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis. The results obtained with the BT474 and SKBR3 cells were validated in the MCF10A ductal cells and in non-invasive MCF-7 breast cancer cells forced into mimicking the in vitro behaviour of the BT474 and SKBR3 cells.;In aggressive breast cancer cells, where mitogenic signalling is enforced by the ErbB2 oncoprotein receptor, functional inhibition of the catalytic activity of PI3K by the betaGBP cytokine and loss of akt mRNA results in apoptotic death. A functional correlation between ERK and the kt gene was also found. The relationship between ERK, akt mRNA, PI3K and cell vulnerability to betaGBP challenge was sustained both in mammary ductal cells forced to mimic an aggressive behaviour and in non-aggressive breast cancer cells undergoing an enforced shift into an aggressive phenotype.;betaGBP, a newly discovered physiological inhibitor of PI3K, is a selective and potent inducer of apoptosis in aggressive breast cancer cells.

Interestingly, MYC but not ERBB2 RNA levels were increased (t-test, P = 0.03) in benign mastopathies of patients with a first-degree (mother/sister) family history (FH) of breast cancer. Among patients without a first-degree FH, MYC RNA levels were significantly higher (t-test, P = 0.02) during the follicular (preovulatory) than the luteal (post-ovulatory) phase and also significantly higher than levels observed in patients with no menstrual cycle (peri- or postmenopausal) (P = 0.004), indicating an in vivo hormonal regulation of MYC. After exclusion of the first-degree FH patients a higher MYC expression was detected in atypia than in other histological types at the follicular but not at the luteal phase, suggesting an increased sensitivity of these high-risk lesions to estrogens. We propose that in addition to a family history and proliferative atypia, elevated MYC RNA levels during the post-ovulatory phase could potentially be used as a marker of the risk of developing breast cancer.

Only patients overexpressing ERBB2 are treated with trastuzumab, whereas its use in tumours without ERBB2 expression is useless. This led to the concept that the subgroup of trastuzumab-sensitive tumours is 'ERBB2-dependent', meaning that ERBB2 signalling is indispensable for growth of these tumours. We used a mouse model that allows anhydrotetracycline (ATc)-controlled downregulation of ERBB2 in tumour tissue. ERBB2 mRNA and protein expression were downregulated below detection limit leading to a macroscopically complete tumour remission within 14 days. Tumour remission was accompanied by a strong decrease in proliferation, a moderate increase in apoptosis, as well as dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT/PKB. These data clearly indicate ERBB2 dependence. Therefore, a high sensitivity to trastuzumab may be suspected. Surprisingly, trastuzumab caused a much weaker effect compared to ATc-induced ERBB2 downregulation, although a decrease in ERBB2 membrane localisation was induced. Only a slight decrease in proliferation and a weak transient increase in apoptosis were observed. Interestingly, tumours responded to trastuzumab by a sharp fivefold increase in phosphorylated AKT/PKB as well as a 3.5- and 5.3-fold increase in AKT1 and AKT2 mRNA levels, respectively. In conclusion, 'ERBB2 dependence' is not sufficient to define trastuzumab-responsive tumours.

They are associated with a poor prognosis but can benefit from targeted therapy. A better knowledge of these BCs, genomically and biologically heterogeneous, may help understand their behavior and design new therapeutic strategies.;We defined the high resolution genome and gene expression profiles of 54 ERBB2-amplified BCs using 244K oligonucleotide array-comparative genomic hybridization and whole-genome DNA microarrays. Expression of ERBB2, phosphorylated ERBB2, EGFR, IGF1R and FOXA1 proteins was assessed by immunohistochemistry to evaluate the functional ERBB2 status and identify co-expressions.;First, we identified the ERBB2-C17orf37-GRB7 genomic segment as the minimal common 17q12-q21 amplicon, and CRKRS and IKZF3 as the most frequent centromeric and telomeric amplicon borders, respectively. Second, GISTIC analysis identified 17 other genome regions affected by copy number aberration (CNA) (amplifications, gains, losses). The expression of 37 genes of these regions was deregulated. Third, two types of heterogeneity were observed in ERBB2-amplified BCs. The genomic profiles of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) ERBB2-amplified BCs were different. The WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway was involved in ER- ERBB2-amplified BCs, and PVT1 and TRPS1 were candidate oncogenes associated with ER+ ERBB2-amplified BCs. The size of the ERBB2 amplicon was different in inflammatory (IBC) and non-inflammatory BCs. ERBB2-amplified IBCs were characterized by the downregulated and upregulated mRNA expression of ten and two genes in proportion to CNA, respectively. IHC results showed (i) a linear relationship between ERBB2 gene amplification and its gene and protein expressions with a good correlation between ERBB2 expression and phosphorylation status; (ii) a potential signaling cross-talk between EGFR or IGF1R and ERBB2, which could influence response of ERBB2-positive BCs to inhibitors. FOXA1 was frequently coexpressed with ERBB2 but its expression did not impact on the outcome of patients with ERBB2-amplified tumors.;We have shown that ER+ and ER- ERBB2-amplified BCs are different, distinguished ERBB2 amplicons in IBC and non-IBC, and identified genomic features that may be useful in the design of alternative therapeutical strategies.",

In a study designed to identify genes up-regulated in breast cancer, a cDNA clone corresponding to a novel gene C35 (C17orf37) was selected by representational difference analysis of tumor and normal human mammary cell lines. Abundant expression of C35 transcript in tumors was confirmed by Northern blot and real-time PCR. The C35 gene is located on chromosome 17q12, 505 nucleotides from the 3' end of the ERBB2 oncogene, the antigenic target for trastuzumab (Herceptin) therapy. The chromosomal arrangement of the genes encoding C35 and ERBB2 is tail to tail. An open reading frame encodes a 12-kDa protein of unknown function. Immunohistochemical analysis detected robust and frequent expression of C35 protein, including 32% of grade 1 and 66% of grades 2 and 3 infiltrating ductal carcinomas of the breast (in contrast to 20% overexpressing HER-2/neu), 38% of infiltrating lobular carcinoma (typically HER-2/neu negative), as well as tumors arising in other tissues. C35 was not detected in 38 different normal human tissues, except Leydig cells in the testes and trace levels in a small percentage of normal breast tissue samples. The distinct and favorable expression profile of C35 spanning early through late stages of disease, including high frequency of overexpression in various breast carcinoma, abundant expression in distant metastases, and either absence or low level expression in normal human tissues, warrants further investigation of the relevance of C35 as a biomarker and/or a target for development of broadly applicable cancer-specific therapies.",

We find that increasing ErbB3-dependent signaling in orthotopic injection models of breast cancer can enhance intravasation and lung metastasis with no effect on primary tumor growth or microvessel density. Enhanced metastatic ability due to increased expression of ErbB2 or ErbB3 correlated with stronger chemotaxis and invasion responses to heregulin beta1. Suppression of ErbB3 expression reduced both intravasation and metastasis. A human breast cancer tumor tissue microarray showed a significant association between ErbB3 and ErbB2 expression and metastasis independent of tumor size.

Breast cancer patients with ERBB2 amplifications are currently treated with lapatinib, a small-molecule kinase inhibitor that specifically blocks EGFR/ERBB2 signaling. Here, we show that hypoxia, via HIF-1, induces resistance to lapatinib-mediated effects in ERBB2-expressing mammary epithelial and ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells. Lapatinib-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis in three-dimensional (3D) cultures are decreased under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia can maintain activation of signaling pathways downstream from ERBB2 including AKT and ERK in the presence of lapatinib. HIF-1 is both required and sufficient to induce lapatinib resistance as overexpression of stable HIF-1 in ERBB2-expressing cells blocks lapatinib-mediated effects and maintains ERBB2-downstream signaling under normoxic conditions. Under hypoxia, activation of ERK signaling is required for lapatinib resistance as treatment with MEK inhibitor trametinib reverses hypoxia-mediated lapatinib resistance. HIF-1 can bypass the lapatinib-treated inhibition of the ERK pathway via inhibition of the dual-specificity phosphatase 2 (DUSP2). Indeed, overexpression of DUSP2 in ErbB2-positve breast cancer cells reverses hypoxia-mediated lapatinib resistance. Thus, our results provide rationale for therapeutic evaluation of the treatment of hypoxic ERBB2 expressing breast tumors with a combination of lapatinib and MEK inhibitors.",

Previous studies suggest that WWP1 promotes cell proliferation and survival; however, the mechanism of WWP1 action is still poorly understood. Here, we showed that WWP1 upregulates and maintains erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ErbB2) and epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) in multiple cell lines. WWP1 depletion dramatically attenuates the EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation. WWP1 forms a protein complex with RING finger protein 11 (RNF11), a negative regulator of ErbB2 and EGFR. The protein-protein interaction is through the first and third WW domains of WWP1 and the PY motif of RNF11. Although WWP1 is able to ubiquitinate RNF11 in vitro and in vivo, WWP1 neither targets RNF11 for degradation nor changes RNF11's cellular localization. Importantly, inhibition of RNF11 can rescue WWP1 siRNA-induced ErbB2 and EGFR downregulation and growth arrest. Finally, we demonstrated that RNF11 is overexpressed in a panel of prostate and breast cancer cell lines with WWP1 expression. These findings suggest that WWP1 may promote cell proliferation and survival partially through suppressing RNF11-mediated ErbB2 and EGFR downregulation.",

Accumulating evidences demonstrate that signaling networks activated by EGFR and transcription factor NF-kappaB are associated with cell response to ionizing radiation (IR). The present study shows that overexpression of ErbB2 enhanced NF-kappaB activation induced by IR in human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells transfected with ErbB2 genes (MCF-7/ErbB2). Stable transfection of dominant-negative mutant IkappaB (MCF-7/ErbB2/mIkappaB) or treatment with anti-ErbB2 antibody, Herceptin, inhibited NF-kappaB activation and radiosensitized MCF-7/ErbB2 cells. Consistent with NF-kappaB regulation, basal and IR-induced Akt, a kinase downstream of ErbB2, was activated in MCF-7/ErbB2 cells and inhibited by Herceptin. To identify specific genes affected by ErbB2-mediated NF-kappaB activation, a group of IR-responsive elements Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1, Bcl-2, Bcl/XL, BAD and BAX were evaluated. Basal levels of prosurvival elements Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1, Bcl-2 and Bcl/XL but not apoptotic BAD and BAX were upregulated in MCF-7/ErbB2 cells with striking enhancements in Bcl-2 and Bcl/XL. IR further induced Cyclin B1 and Cyclin D1 expression that was reduced by Herceptin. Bcl-2 kept a high steady level after Herceptin+IR treatment and, in contrast to control MCF-7/Vector cells, Bcl/XL was inhibited in MCF-7/ErbB2 cells by Herceptin+IR treatment. However, all four prosurvival proteins were downregulated by inhibition of NF-kappaB in MCF-7/ErbB2/mIkappaB cells. These results thus provide evidence suggesting that overexpression of ErbB2 is able to enhance NF-kappaB response to IR, and that a specific prosurvival network downstream of NF-kappaB is triggered by treatments using anti-ErbB2 antibody combined with radiation.",

Such information may be of importance to therapy, as amplification of TOP2A has been associated with dose-dependent sensitivity to anthracycline therapy in breast cancer. We examined 40 breast carcinomas from BRCA1 mutation carriers and 40 sporadic breast carcinomas matched for age, tumour diameter and histological grade for HER-2 and TOP2A amplification status using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Co-amplification of TOP2A and HER-2 was found in four of the mutation carriers and in three of the controls.

The present study was therefore to estimate serum HER-2/neu levels in breast cancer patients and associate these with other prognostic factors.;Serum HER-2/neu levels were studied in 207 patients with breast cancer, 15 with benign breast diseases, (BBD) and 175 age-matched healthy controls.

Serum HER-2/neu levels were negatively correlated with hormone receptor positivity.;HER-2/neu serum tests should be done more frequently in Indian women with breast cancer, irrespective of their ER and PgR hormone receptor status.

In this study, the binding capability of LDP to human breast cancer tissues was detected with tissue microarray. The correlation study of LDP binding capability to human breast tumor tissues and relevant therapeutic targets was performed on breast cancer tissue microarrays. Immunocytochemical examination was used to detect the binding capability of LDP to human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells. As a result, tissue microarray showed that LDP staining of 73.2% (30/41) of breast cancer tissues was positive, whereas that of 48.3% (15/31) of the adjacent normal breast specimens was positive. The difference between the tumor and normal samples was significant (Chi2 = 4.63, P < 0.05). LDP immunoreactivity in breast cancer correlated significantly with the overexpression of VEGF and HER2 (P < 0.001 and < 0.01, r = 0.389 and 0.287, respectively). Determined with confocal immunofluorescent analysis, LDP showed the binding capability to mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells. It is demonstrated that LDP can bind to human breast cancer tissues and there is significant difference between the breast cancer tissues and the corresponding normal tissues. Notably, the binding reactivity shows positive correlation with the expression of VEGF and HER2 in breast carcinoma tissues. The results imply that LDP may have a potential use as targeting drug carrier in the research and development of new anticancer therapeutics.

        "Doc_abstract":"The activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly ErbB2, has been linked to the genesis and progression of breast cancer. Two of the central signaling pathways activated by ErbB2 are the Ras/Raf-1/Mek/Erk pathway, which plays an important role in tumor cell growth and migration, and the PI3K/Akt pathway, which plays an important role in cell survival. Recently, we and others have shown that signaling through the Ras-Erk pathway can be influenced by p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1), an effector of the Rho family GTP ases Rac and Cdc42. Expression of activated forms of Rac promotes activation of Erk through mechanisms involving Pak1 phosphorylation of Raf-1 and Mek1. In addition, Pak1 has also been implicated in the activation of Akt. However, our understanding regarding the degree to which Rho GTPases, and their effectors such as Pak1, contribute to ErbB2-mediated signaling is very limited.Recent results from our laboratory indicate that ErbB2 expression correlates with Pak activation in estrogen receptor negative human breast tumor samples. Using a three-dimensional (3D) culture of human MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells, we found that activation of Rac-Pak pathway by ErbB2 induces growth factor independent proliferation and promotes disruption of acini-like structures through the activation of the Erk and Akt pathways. We also observed that blocking Pak1 activity by small molecule inhibitors impeded the ability of activated ErbB2 to transform these cells and to activate its associated downstream signaling targets. In addition, we found that suppressing Pak activity in ErbB2-amplified breast cancer cells delayed tumor formation and downregulated Erk and Akt signaling in vivo. These results support a model in which Pak, by activating Erk and Akt, cooperates with ErbB2 in transforming mammary epithelial cells.",

Docetaxel has been shown to be more potent than paclitaxel in inducing bcl-2 phosphorylation and apoptosis and is clinically active in some paclitaxel-resistant breast tumors.

Using a HER-2/neu transfected MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, we investigated the role of HER-2/neu overexpression on resistance to paclitaxel and docetaxel treatment. A control vector transfected MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line (MCF/neo) and a HER-2/neu transfected MCF-7 line (MCF/18) were treated with various concentrations of docetaxel or paclitaxel. Cell number was assessed using the MTT tetrazolium dye assay. In the control vector transfected MCF/neo cell line, paclitaxel and docetaxel gave similar dose-dependent growth inhibition ( p = 0.175). In HER-2/neu transfected MCF/18 cells, docetaxel treatment resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition similar to that seen in MCF/neo cells. Paclitaxel, however, gave significantly less growth inhibition than docetaxel in the HER-2/neu overexpressing MCF/18 cells (p = 0.0003). These data suggest that HER-2/neu overexpression may contribute to paclitaxel resistance. In contrast, the cytotoxic effects of docetaxel in these breast carcinoma cells are not affected by HER-2/neu expression. Therefore, docetaxel may be the preferred taxane therapy in HER-2/neu overexpressing breast tumors.",

Targeted therapies such as endocrine therapy and growth factor receptor inhibitors have had a significant impact on the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, resistance to these agents eventually occurs, and currently represents a significant clinical problem in the management of breast cancers. Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACi) exhibit anticancer activity in a variety of tumor cell models and have been shown to target mechanisms of resistance to a number of targeted agents. It is unclear, however, if there are specific breast cancer subtypes for which an HDACi may be more or less effective. Here, we report that the class I isoform-selective HDACi entinostat (SNDX-275) preferentially inhibits cell proliferation/survival and inactivates downstream signaling in erbB2-overexpressing compared with basal breast cancer cells. SNDX-275 reduces the levels of both erbB2 and erbB3, as well as significantly decreases P-erbB2, P-erbB3, P-Akt, and P-MAPK in erbB2-overexpressing cells. Additionally, SNDX-275 promotes apoptosis and induces cell cycle arrest predominantly at G(1) phase in erbB2-overexpressing cells, whereas SNDX-275 mainly induces G(2)-M arrest in basal breast cancer cells. The cellular bias of SNDX-275 is shown to be related partly to the levels of erbB3 expression that directly impact the ability of SNDX-275 to inhibit proliferation/survival of the erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. These findings show that SNDX-275 may be developed as a novel therapeutic agent to treat breast cancers with coexpression of both erbB2 and erbB3.",

This subgroup accounts for 15% of all types of breast cancer and for a higher percentage of breast cancer arising in African and African-American women who are premenopausal. Because of the absence of specific treatment guidelines for this subgroup, triple-negative breast cancers are managed with standard treatment; however, such treatment leaves them associated with a high rate of local and systemic relapse. Histologically, such cancers are poorly differentiated, and most fall into the basal subgroup of breast cancers, characterised by staining for basal markers (ie, cytokeratin 5/6). Analyses of microarray gene-expression profiling data show that they form a homogeneous group (or so-called cluster) in transcriptional terms and, increasingly, research studies are identifying basal cancers on the basis of exhibiting this distinctive transcriptional profile. Histologically and transcriptionally, triple-negative breast cancers have many similarities to BRCA1-associated breast cancers, which suggests that dysfunction in BRCA1 or related pathways occurs in this subset of sporadic cancers. In this review, we discuss the molecular features of triple-negative breast cancers and consider how the use of existing cytotoxic agents can be optimised for this patient group.

Its prognostic value in node-negative cases and its predictive value for response to chemotherapy remain controversial. This may be related to the use of molecular methods, which are sensitive to dilution of tumor material by normal cells, or the use of nonstandardized immunohistochemistry (IHC) procedures, for the determination of the ERBB2 gene status. In addition, new therapeutic approaches that target the cells overexpressing ERBB2 are under development. These perspectives necessitate a reliable evaluation of the status of ERBB2 in individual tumors before the application of specific therapeutic strategies. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and IHC allow the evaluation of the ERBB2 status specifically in tumor cells on archival material. We have analyzed a series of 100 invasive ductal breast carcinomas without lymph node invasion both by IHC, using the CB11 monoclonal antibody and a sensitive Auidin Biotin Complex (ABC) immunodetection system, and by FISH, using the Oncor Inform HER-21neu (ERBB2) gene amplification detection system as reference technique. Complete concordance between the results of FISH and IHC was seen in 98% of the cases. ERBB2 amplification (more than four signals per nucleus) was observed in 12 of the 100 cases, and all but one showed an overexpression of the protein (membrane staining) by IHC. Conversely, ERBB2 expression was present in one case without gene amplification. In conclusion, ERBB2 overexpression detected by IHC is highly correlated to gene amplification detected by FISH. Thus, under standardized conditions, IHC is a reliable and economical test to assess the ERBB2 status in tumors. The use of FISH could be limited to the verification of the status of tumors displaying a weak membrane immunostaining.",

In breast cancer patients, HER-2 overexpression correlates with an aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis. HER-2, therefore, has become the focus of many anti-cancer therapeutic approaches. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of HER-2, was the first FDA-approved HER-2-targeted therapy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. However, not all HER-2-overexpressing patients respond to trastuzumab and most that initially respond develop resistance within one year of treatment. Trastuzumab resistance has been studied in cell line models of resistance and several mechanisms of resistance have been proposed. More recent anti-HER-2 strategies involve targeting its tyrosine kinase domain; for example, lapatinib (Tykerb) is a dual HER-2 and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and has shown efficacy as a single agent and in combination with other therapeutics. A number of novel HER-2 antagonists are currently in preclinical or clinical development, including both monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors. Increased understanding of HER-2 signaling in breast cancer, and of response and resistance to HER-2 antagonists, will aid the development of strategies to overcome resistance to HER-2 targeted therapies.",

In breast cancer, HER-2/neu is expressed in early disease development in a large percentage of DCIS lesions and its expression is associated with an increased risk of invasion and recurrence. Targeting HER-2 with antibodies such as trastuzumab or pertuzumab has improved survival, but patients with more extensive disease may develop resistance to therapy. Interestingly, response to HER-2 targeted therapies correlates with presence of immune response genes in the breast. Th1 cell production of the cytokines interferon gamma (IFNγ) and TNFα can enhance MHC class I expression, PD-L1 expression, augment apoptosis and tumor senescence, and enhances growth inhibition of many anti-breast cancer agents, including anti-estrogens and HER-2 targeted therapies. Recently, we have identified that a loss of anti-HER-2 CD4 Th1 in peripheral blood occurs during breast tumorigenesis and is dramatically diminished, even in Stage I breast cancers. The loss of anti-HER-2 Th1 response is specific and not readily reversed by standard therapies. In fact, this loss of anti-HER-2 Th1 response in peripheral blood correlates with lack of complete response to neoadjuvant therapy and diminished disease-free survival. This defect can be restored with HER-2 vaccinations in both DCIS and IBC. Correcting the anti-HER-2 Th1 response may have significant impact in improving response to HER-2 targeted therapies. Development of immune monitoring systems for anti-HER-2 Th1 to identify patients at risk for recurrence could be critical to improving outcomes, since the anti-HER-2 Th1 response can be restored by vaccination. Correction of the cellular immune response against HER-2 may prevent recurrence in high-risk patients with DCIS and IBC at risk of developing new or recurrent breast cancer.",

A combination of sequence analysis, reporter gene assays, quantitative real-time PCR, electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays and immunoblot analysis further confirmed the four AP-2gamma target genes in carcinogenesis group: ErbB2, CDH2, HPSE and IGSF11. Our results were consistent with the previous reports that ErbB2 was the target gene of AP-2gamma. Decreased expression and overexpression of AP-2gamma in human breast cancer cells significantly altered the expression of these four genes, indicating that AP-2gamma directly regulates them.;This suggested that AP-2gamma can coordinate the expression of a network of genes, involving in carcinogenesis, especially in breast cancer.

Phosphopeptide competition and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Tyr-1139 of erbB2 is the major binding site for the Grb7 SH2 domain, indicating an overlap in binding specificity between the Grb7 and Grb2 SH2 domains. Substituting individual amino acids in the Grb14 SH2 domain with the corresponding residues from Grb7 demonstrated that a Gln to Leu change at the betaD6 position imparted high affinity erbB2 interaction, paralleled by a marked increase in affinity for the Tyr-1139 phosphopeptide.

Whether these two modes of ErbB2 activation cause the same biological responses is unknown. Here, we uncovered important differences in the signaling, proliferation rates, and the response to anti-ErbB2 antibodies when comparing MCF7 cells expressing the ligand neuregulin, to MCF7 cells overexpressing ErbB2. Expression of neuregulin caused higher proliferation than ErbB2 overexpression. Transmembrane neuregulin expression was accompanied by constitutive activation of ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 receptors. ErbB2 overexpression caused tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2, whereas ErbB3 and ErbB4 were only slightly tyrosine phosphorylated. Autocrine transmembrane neuregulin also caused constitutive activation of several signaling pathways, such as the Erk1/2, Erk5, and Akt routes, which have been linked to breast cancer cell proliferation. Interestingly, expression of neuregulin increased p21 levels and this was required for the proliferation of MCF7 cells. Treatment with the anti-ErbB2 receptor antibody Herceptin had an inhibitory effect on proliferation only in cells expressing neuregulin but not on cells overexpressing ErbB2, and its inhibitory activity was accompanied by a decrease in p21.

This technique is based on the simultaneous amplification of a potentially amplified oncogene (HER-2) and a reference gene (IFN-gamma).

To address whether Src activity is essential for Neu-mediated tumorigenesis, we used a physiologic inhibitor of Src kinase activity, the Csk homologous kinase (CHK), expressed as a mammary tissue-specific transgene. Our data, using a physiologic inhibitor of Src activity (CHK), showed that blocking of Neu-induced Src activity without altering Src expression levels had no significant effects on Neu-mediated mammary tumorigenesis in vivo. This contradicts the current paradigm that activation of Src kinases is essential for Neu-induced oncogenesis.

Recent studies have shown that integrins physically and functionally associate with growth factor receptors suggesting the cooperative regulation of these two signals.

Compared with HME cells, all of non-metastatic and metastatic cell lines showed decreased expressions of alpha2 and beta4 integrin subunits. Two metastatic cell lines, but not three non-metastatic tumor cell lines, expressed alpha5 and alpha6 comparable to HME cells. There was no correlation of erbB2 expression with integrin expressions. We isolated MDA-MB435 subpopulations expressing lower amount of alpha6 integrin and found that alpha5, but not alpha2 and alphav integrins, was concomitantly decreased while erbB family was not affected. Then we transfected erbB2 gene into MDA-MB435 and found the induction of erbB3 expression but not erbB1 and erbB4.

Ovarian cancer was observed in one patient in the early-onset families. Using seven polymorphic markers on chromosome 17q21, D17S250, ERBB2, THRA1, D17S579, D17S588, GIP and NME1, linkage to BRCA1 was analyzed. Linkage was not detected in any single family. Assuming homogeneity in an inherited component that confines the susceptibility to breast cancer in all families, we summed the LOD scores of all families. The cumulative LOD score obtained was -1.86 for D17S588 at theta = 0.001, indicating no linkage with BRCA1. Since the proportion of families linked to BRCA1 is larger in Western early-onset breast cancer families than in late-onset ones, we also summed the LOD scores of five early-onset families.

        "Doc_abstract":"Identifying markers that have the potential to predict tumor behavior is important in breast cancer because of the variability in clinical disease progression. Genetic alterations in tumors may appear as changes in total DNA content, individual chromosomes, single genes, or gene expression. Alteration in DNA content is an imprecise but accessible measurement of the genome. Diploid tumors have been associated with a better clinical outcome, and increased ploidy correlates with other indicators of poor prognosis. Concurrent analysis of DNA content with markers of genetic expression is feasible (e.g., myc oncogene) and may increase its prognostic power. Chromosomal studies could provide a more precise tool for localizing genetic damage, but there is little cytogenetic information about primary breast cancers, no convincing evidence has emerged to target locations in the karyotype that appear specifically altered, and many primary and cultured breast cancers contain cells that appear chromosomally normal. Attempts to define molecular markers have used probes of different chromosomal sites, some chosen because of logical associations with hormonal activity, known oncogenes, or tumor-suppressor genes, and some by chance. Currently, to the authors' knowledge, none has shown uniform changes by mutation, loss, or overexpression in all breast cancers, although a remarkable number of loci are altered to some extent. These lesions must be associated with particular disease subsets or, retrospectively, with differential survival if they are to have prognostic value.;The authors examined several loci (ERBB2, INT2, MUC1) for gene amplification or loss of heterozygosity by Southern blotting and for gene expression by immunohistochemistry in breast tumors from patient groups selected by survival.;A retrospective series showed gene amplification at the erbB2 locus in 22% of rapidly recurrent (RR) tumors and 13% of tumors from long-term tumor-free survivors (LTS), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.18). The erbB2 product was displayed histochemically with equal frequency between those with RR tumors and LTS patients. Moreover, the correlation was poor between different analytic measures on the same tumors. This result was tested using a prospective study of erbB2 to correlate DNA analysis with western blot findings and frozen and fixed histochemical results. Another oncogene, int2, showed significant correlation between amplification and recurrence; 16% of RR tumors showing genetic amplification (P = 0.02).

Sequential exposure to cerulenin followed by docetaxel again yielded strong synergism in SK-Br3 cells, whereas antagonistic and moderate synergistic interactions were observed in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively.

Moreover, we found several positive correlations between specific amplicons from different chromosomes, suggesting the existence of cooperating genetic loci. Queried by gene, the most frequently amplified kinase was PTK2 (79% of tumors), whereas the most frequently lost kinase was PTK2B (hemizygous loss in 34% of tumors). Amplification of ERBB2 as measured by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) correlated closely with ERBB2 DNA and RNA levels measured by quantitative PCR as well as with ERBB2 protein levels. The overall frequency of recurrent losses was lower, with no region lost in more than 50% of tumors; the most frequently lost tumor suppressor gene was RB1 (hemizygous loss in 26% of tumors). Finally, we find that specific copy number changes in cell lines closely mimicked those in primary tumors, with an overall Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.843 for gains and 0.734 for losses.;High resolution CGH analysis of breast cancer reveals several regions where DNA copy number is commonly gained or lost, that non-random correlations between specific amplicons exist, and that specific genetic alterations are maintained in breast cancer cell lines despite repeat passage in tissue culture.

The extracellular domain of HER-2/neu undergoes proteolytic cleavage from the full-length protein by metalloproteases, and is shed into the blood as a circulating antigen. While HER-2/neu gene amplification and/or protein overexpression are detected in approximately 25% of primary breast cancers, serum HER-2/neu levels are elevated beyond the upper limit of normal in 50 to 60% of stage IV breast cancer patients. HER-2/neu in serum can be detected by enzyme immunoassays (manual and automated versions). It has been shown to have prognostic and predictive information in breast cancer patients. Monitoring for recurrence by serum HER-2/neu reaches a high sensitivity for HER-2/neu positive tumors. Longitudinal follow-up of patients during any kind of systemic therapy allows for monitoring of the therapeutic success. When utilized in these applications, serum HER-2/neu testing is complementary to HER-2/neu tissue results and to the determination of classical tumor markers such as CA 15-3, CA 27.29 and CEA, which are not targeted by specific forms of systemic therapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Invasive breast carcinomas are heterogeneous and exhibit distinct molecular features and biological behavior. Understanding the underlying molecular events that promote breast cancer progression is necessary to improve treatment and prognostication. TGF-β receptor III (TBR3) is a member of the TGF-β signaling pathway, with functions in cell proliferation and migration in malignancies, including breast cancer. Recent studies propose that TBR3 may function as a tumor suppressor and that its loss may correlate with disease progression. However, there are limited data on the expression of TBR3 in breast cancer in relationship to tumor type, hormonal receptor status and HER-2/neu, and patient outcome. In this study, we investigated the expression of TBR3 in a cohort of 205 primary invasive breast carcinomas in tissue microarrays (TMAs), with comprehensive clinical, pathological and follow- up information. Sections were stained for TBR3 and evaluated for intensity of reactivity based on a 4-tiered scoring system (1 to 4; TBR3 low = scores 1-2; TBR3 high = scores 3-4). Of the 205 invasive carcinomas, 123 were luminal type (95 type A, 28 type B), 8 were HER-2 type, and 62 were triple negative (TN). TBR3 was high in 112 (55 %) and low in 93 (45 %) cases. Low TBR3 was associated with higher histological grade and worse disease free and overall survival, all features of biologically aggressive breast carcinomas. TBR3 was significantly associated with the subtype of breast cancer, as low TBR3 was detected in 95 % of TN compared to 22 % of luminal tumors (p < 0.0001). We discovered a significant association between low TBR3 protein expression, TN breast cancer phenotype, and disease progression. These data suggest that TBR3 loss might be linked to the development of TN breast cancers and pave the way to investigating whether restoring TBR3 function may be a therapeutic strategy against TN breast carcinomas.

Controversy exists as to the best method for its determination caused primarily by the variable sensitivities of the different antibodies and interobserver differences, particularly in the group of breast cancers with borderline levels of expression of the protein product. This study was therefore designed to determine the status of the HER2 gene amplification in a group of breast carcinomas with low levels of overexpression. After an initial validation of our procedures, a series of 52 consecutive cases of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancers with low levels of overexpression and a series of 22 cases with no expression by immunohistochemistry were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and the results correlated statistically. Amplification of the HER2 gene was observed in 16% of equivocal to weakly positive cases. Those that were amplified showed low levels of amplification with ratios less than 4.5 and a characteristic scattered pattern of distribution of HER2 signals in the FISH assay. In addition, heterogeneity was noted in two cases in the amplification of the HER2 gene within the same tumor samples with pockets of amplified tumor cells amidst nonamplified tumor cells. In cases without amplification, a statistically significant number showed chromosome 17 polysomy. In conclusion, equivocal to low levels of HER2 overexpression in breast cancers are associated, in the majority of cases, with chromosome 17 polysomy and a corresponding increase in the HER2 gene numbers. True gene amplification is present in only a minority of cases. FISH analysis should be used for confirmation of gene amplification. Prior screening and selection of appropriate immunohistochemistry-positive areas for FISH analysis may prove beneficial.",

An immunohistochemical study was conducted on 200 breast carcinoma specimens using the avidin-biotin peroxidase method. ABCG2 was expressed in 77% of cases of invasive ductal carcinoma. There was a statistically significant correlation between ABCG2 expression and each of the tumor grade, clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and HER2 immunostaining, but no such association with progesterone receptor (PR) and estrogen receptor (ER) status. Increased expression of ABCG2 in invasive ductal carcinoma cells and its statistically significant correlation with HER2 expression are strongly correlated with tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis in human breast cancer and indicates that ABCG2 can be used as a target for the development of novel therapies.",

Overexpression of ErbB2 causes anoikis resistance that contributes to luminal filling in three-dimensional mammary epithelial acinar structures in vitro. Given that integrins and growth factor receptors are highly interdependent for function, we examined the role of integrin subunits in ErbB2-mediated survival signaling. Here, we show that MCF-10A cells overexpressing ErbB2 upregulate integrin alpha5 via the MAP-kinase pathway in three-dimensional acini and found elevated integrin alpha5 levels associated with ErbB2 status in human breast cancer. Integrin alpha5 is required for ErbB2-mediated anoikis resistance and for optimal ErbB2 signaling to the Mek-Erk-Bim axis as depletion of integrin alpha5 reverses anoikis resistance and Bim inhibition. Integrin alpha5 is required for full activation of ErbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation on Y877 and ErbB2 phosphorylation is associated with increased activity of Src in the absence of adhesion. Indeed, we show that blocking elevated Src activity during cell detachment reverses ErbB2-mediated survival and Bim repression. Thus, integrin alpha5 serves as a key mediator of Src and ErbB2-survival signaling in low adhesion states, which are necessary to block the pro-anoikis mediator Bim, and we suggest that this pathway represents a potential novel therapeutic target in ErbB2-positive tumors.",

Expression of ER, PR, Her-2 and Ki-67 was analyzed to classify molecular subtypes of breast cancer by immunohistochemistry. The differences of molecular subtypes of breast cancers in regard to TNM staging and pathological grade were analyzed using χ(2) tests. Values of P<0.05 were considered statistically significant. The frequency of luminal A, luminal B, HER2-positive luminal B, triple negative and non-luminal HER2-positive subtypes were: 35.5%, 22.5%, 13.1%, 15.2% and 13.7%, respectively. Among the five subtypes of breast cancer, the distribution of pathological grades showed a significant difference (P<0.001). There were significant differences in the distribution of TNM staging among the five subtypes of breast cancer (P<0.001). In addition to traditional prognostic indicators such as TNM staging and pathological grade, molecular subtype may aid clinical practice and research into breast cancer. Different molecular subtypes will lead to different prognosis and therapeutic option. Molecular subtyping is essential for breast cancer management. ",

We evaluated the prognostic value of breast cancer subtypes, Ki-67 proliferation index (Ki-67PI), and pathologic tumor characteristics on breast cancer survival in Caucasian women in our institution, where greater than 90% of the total patient population is white. From 628 new invasive breast cancer cases in our data base (2000-late 2004), 593 (94%) were identified in Caucasian women. ER/PR/HER2 breast cancer subtypes were classified based on St. Gallen International Expert Consensus recommendations from 2011. ER/PR/HER2 status and its effect on survival were analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier curve. ER/PR/HER2 status, grade, tumor-node-metastasis status (TNM)/anatomic stage, and age were analyzed in terms of survival in a multivariate fashion using a Cox regression. Ki-67PI was analyzed between ER/PR/HER2 groups using the Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and 2 × 5 ANOVA.

Similar effect was seen with T2, N2/N3, or M1 tumors in comparison with T1, N0/N1, and M0 tumors. Chances of dying increase approximately 5% for every year increase in age. There was a significant main effect of Ki-67PI between ER/PR/HER2 subtypes, p < .001, but Ki-67PI could not predict survival.

This study was designed to evaluate the changes of Alu and LINE-1 hypomethylation during breast cancer progression from normal to pre-invasive lesions and invasive breast cancer (IBC), and their relationship with characteristics of IBC. We analyzed the methylation status of Alu and LINE-1 in 145 cases of breast samples including normal breast tissue, atypical ductal hyperplasia/flat epithelial atypia (ADH/FEA), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and IBC, and another set of 129 cases of IBC by pyrosequencing. Alu methylation showed no significant changes during multistep progression of breast cancer, although it tended to decrease during the transition from DCIS to IBC. In contrast, LINE-1 methylation significantly decreased from normal to ADH/FEA, while it was similar in ADH/FEA, DCIS and IBC. In IBC, Alu hypomethylation correlated with negative estrogen receptor (ER) status, and LINE-1 hypomethylation was associated with negative ER status, ERBB2 (HER2) amplification and p53 overexpression. Alu and LINE-1 methylation status was significantly different between breast cancer subtypes, and the HER2 enriched subtype had lowest methylation levels. In survival analyses, low Alu methylation status tended to be associated with poor disease-free survival of the patients.

Because breast cancer initiation is different between BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and women who do not carry mutations, it is possible that the mechanism of breast cancer progression is also different. Histopathologic and genetic studies have supported this hypothesis. To test this hypothesis further, we utilized a large cohort of women who underwent therapeutic mastectomy (TM) and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (PM). From this cohort, we developed case groups of women with a family history of breast cancer with BRCA1/2 deleterious mutations, with unclassified variant alterations, and with no detected mutation and matched these cases with sporadic controls from the same TM and PM cohort. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on paraffin sections by use of dual-color probes for ERBB2/CEP17, MYC/CEP8, TBX2/CEP17, and RPS6KB1/CEP17. All malignant and benign lesions, including putative precursor lesions, were studied. The invasive cancers from deleterious mutation carriers had a higher prevalence of duplication of MYC (P = 0.006) and TBX2 (P = 0.0008) compared to controls and a lower prevalence of ERBB2 amplification (P = 0.011). Coduplication of MYC and TBX2 was common in the in situ and invasive lesions from the deleterious mutation carriers. The odds ratio of having a BRCA1/2 mutation is 31.4 (95% CI = 1.7-569) when MYC and TBX2 are coduplicated but ERBB2 is normal. Unclassified variant carriers/no mutation detected and sporadic controls had a similar prevalence of alterations, suggesting that hereditary patients with no deleterious mutations follow a progression pathway similar to that of sporadic cases. With the exception of one atypical ductal hyperplasia lesion, no putative precursor lesion showed any detectable alteration of the probes tested. There was no significant intratumoral heterogeneity of genetic alterations. Our data confirm that a specific pattern of genomic instability characterizes BRCA1/2-related cancers and that this pattern has implications for the biology of these cancers.

Absence of BRCA1 or functional overexpression of the HER-2/neu gene presumably contributes to the somatic phenotype of breast cancer in premenopausal women, characterized by unfavorable prognostic features such as high tumor grade, hormone receptor negativity, and high proliferation rate. To examine whether amplification of HER-2/neu contributes to the aggressive biology of BRCA1-associated tumors, we have performed fluorescence in situ hybridization on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast tumor tissue sections from 53 BRCA1 mutation carriers and 41 randomly selected, age-matched sporadic breast cancer cases. Although BRCA1-associated and sporadic tumors were equally likely (19% versus 22%) to exhibit HER-2/neu amplification [defined as a ratio of HER-2/neu copies to chromosome 17 centromere (CEP17) copies > or = 2], 6 (15%) of the sporadic tumors were highly amplified (defined as a ratio greater-than-or-equal 5) versus none of the BRCA1-associated tumors (P = 0.048). HER-2 protein overexpression as measured by immunohistochemical analysis was not observed among the BRCA1-associated cases (P = 0.042). Four of 21 (19%) sporadic tumors exhibited strong membranous staining of HER-2 (intensity level of 3+) as compared with 0 of 39 BRCA1-associated tumors. Our data suggest that a germ-line mutation in the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene is associated with a significantly lower level of HER-2/neu amplification. Thus, it is possible that BRCA1-associated and HER-2/neu-highly amplified tumors progress through distinct molecular pathways, and the aggressive pathological features of BRCA1-associated tumors appear unrelated to amplification of the adjacent HER-2/neu oncogene.",

Immunohistochemical surrogates have been used for this classification, because gene expression profiling is not yet routinely feasible. Male breast cancer is rare and large series are lacking. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry for molecular subtyping of male breast cancer. A total of 134 cases of male breast cancer were immunohistochemically stained on tissue microarrays for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), as well as for CK5/6, CK14, and Ki67. HER2 was also assessed by chromogen in situ hybridization. Cases were classified as luminal A (ER+ and/or PR+, and HER2- and Ki67 low), luminal B (ER+ and/or PR+, and HER2+ or Ki67 high), HER2 driven (ER-, PR-, HER2+), basal-like (ER-, PR-, HER2-, CK5/6+ and/or CK14+ and/or EGFR+), or unclassifiable triple-negative (negative for all six markers). Luminal type A was by far the most encountered type of male breast cancers, representing 75% of the cases. Luminal type B was seen in 21% and the remaining 4% of cases were classified as basal-like (n=4) and unclassifiable triple-negative (n=1). No HER2 driven cases were identified. Patients with basal-like cancer were significantly younger (P=0.034). Luminal B type cancers showed significantly higher histological grade (P<0.001), mitotic index (P<0.001), and PR negativity (P=0.005) compared with luminal type A cancers. In conclusion, most male breast cancers are luminal A and luminal B types, whereas basal-like, unclassifiable triple-negative, and HER2 driven male breast cancers are rare. Luminal type B seem to represent a subtype with an aggressive phenotype. This distribution of molecular subtypes in male breast cancer is clearly different compared with female breast cancers, pointing to possible important differences in carcinogenesis.",

Here we show that treatment of A431 cells with different epidermal growth factor receptor ligands can cause growth inhibition to an extent paralleling ErbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation. To determine whether such growth inhibition signifies an interaction between the cell cycle machinery and ErbB2-dependent alterations of cell signalling kinetics, we used MCF7 breast cancer cells (which express wild-type p53) to create transient and stable ErbB2 transfectants (MCF7-B2). Compared with parental cells, MCF7-B2 cells are characterised by upregulation of p53, p21(WAF) and Myc, downregulation of Bcl2, and apoptosis. In contrast, MCF7-B2 cells co-transfected with dominant negative p53 (MCF7-B2/Delta p53) exhibit reduced apoptosis and enhanced growth relative to both parental MCF7-B2 and control cells. These data imply that wild-type p53 limits survival of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, and suggest that signals of varying length and/or intensity may evoke different cell outcomes depending upon the integrity of cell cycle control genes. We submit that acquisition of cell cycle control defects may play a permissive role in ErbB2 upregulation, and that the ErbB2 overexpression phenotype may in turn select for the survival of cells with p53 mutations or other tumour suppressor gene defects.",

There is a reported synergistic relationship between trastuzumab and ZD1839 therapy in patients with breast cancer. Although EGFR is the preferred dimerization partner for HER-2, it is unclear whether expression of these 2 interrelated receptors in a given patient with breast cancer would be parallel or mutually exclusive.;To assess EGFR status in primary breast carcinoma versus metastatic central nervous system (CNS) sites and to compare results with HER-2/neu status in the same tumor.;Central nervous system metastases (n = 51) from 33 patients and corresponding primary breast cancer specimens, when available (n = 11), were immunohistochemically stained for EGFR using a monoclonal mouse anti-EGFR antibody (clone 31G7) that recognizes both the wild-type form and the 145-kd variant III form of EGFR. The sections were evaluated by visual and image analysis techniques, and results were compared to previously assessed HER-2/neu status.;Epidermal growth factor receptor expression was found in CNS metastases from 39% of patients, with 82% concordance between the EGFR status of the primary breast and metastatic sites, and 92% concordance between the EGFR status among multiple CNS metastases in a given patient. Epidermal growth factor receptor and HER-2/neu status were concordant at the primary site in only 45% of patients. Additionally, EGFR and HER-2/neu status were concordant among multiple CNS metastases per individual case in only 45% of patients.;Thirty-nine percent of patients with metastatic breast cancer express EGFR, with parallel expression between metastatic sites and the primary neoplasm in 82% of the cases. The discordance in 18% of the cases, however, suggests that anti-EGFR agents might not show equal efficacy against metastatic tumor deposits and the primary tumor within a given patient. An additional corollary for pathologists based on this nonhomogeneity of receptor expression is that both the primary breast and multiple metastatic tumor deposits may need to be individually assessed for EGFR status. In our study, most metastatic tumor deposits showed expression for either EGFR or HER-2/neu, and less often for both, implying that drug therapies could be individualized for patients based on test results for both receptors.",

Cluster analysis of the expression data showed that there was close clustering of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Src, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta) in all of the cell lines. The most differentially expressed proteins between ER- and PR-positive and ER- and PR-negative breast cells were mTOR, Akt (pThr308), PDGFRbeta, PDGFRbeta (pTyr751), panSrc, Akt (pSer473), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (IGFBP5), Src (pTyr418), mTOR (pSer2448), and IGFBP2.

However, it is frequent to find reports that describe discordance between HER2 expression in primary and metastatic tumours. The aim of this paper was to verify whether HER2 status of breast carcinomas is maintained in the corresponding axillary metastasis. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 52 breast carcinomas and their matched axillary metastasis. HercepTest results were concordant in 46 out of 52 cases (88.5%). FISH proved that the differences observed were clinically relevant in only one of the 52 cases studied (98% concordance). We concluded that HER2 status was stable during axillary metastatic progression. Evaluation of gene HER2 status in axillary metastasis rather than in the primary can be useful in certain situations, e.g., small invasive component intimately mixed with in situ component and difficult to recognize in dark field, no tumor after biopsy, or axillary relapse (in this case we can find occasional de novo amplifications susceptible to trastuzumab treatment).",

        "Doc_abstract":"Breast cancer is the most common tumor in women with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS), an inherited cancer syndrome associated with germline mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Their lifetime breast cancer risk is 49% by age 60. Breast cancers in TP53 mutation carriers recently have more often been reported to be hormone receptor and HER-2 positive by immunohistochemistry and FISH in small series. We seek to complement the existing small literature with this report of a histopathologic analysis of breast cancers from women with documented LFS. Unstained slides and paraffin-embedded tumor blocks from breast cancers from 39 germline TP53 mutation carriers were assembled from investigators in the LFS consortium. Central histology review was performed on 93% of the specimens by a single breast pathologist from a major university hospital. Histology, grade, and hormone receptor status were assessed by immunohistochemistry; HER-2 status was defined by immunohistochemistry and/or FISH. The 43 tumors from 39 women comprise 32 invasive ductal carcinomas and 11 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS). No other histologies were observed. The median age at diagnosis was 32 years (range 22-46). Of the invasive cancers, 84% were positive for ER and/or PR; and 81% were high grade. Sixty three percent of invasive and 73% of in situ carcinomas were positive for Her2/neu (IHC 3+ or FISH amplified). Of the invasive tumors, 53% were positive for both ER and HER2+; other ER/PR/HER2 combinations were observed. The DCIS were positive for ER and HER2 in 27% of the cases. This report of the phenotype of breast cancers from women with LFS nearly doubles the literature on this topic. Most DCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas in LFS are hormone receptor positive and/or HER-2 positive. These findings suggest that modern treatments may result in improved outcomes for women with LFS-associated breast cancer.",

The oncogene called HER-2/neu or c-erbB-2 located at 17q21 encodes a 185-kD transmembrane glycoprotein, p185. The HER-2/neu gene is frequently overexpressed in human breast cancers as a result of gene amplification and/or elevated transcription. In this study we investigated the association between the presence of HER-2/neu gene ampliflcation and appearance and/or progression of breast cancer. Paraffin embedded tumour tissue was obtained from 82 women with breast cancer. Blood samples from age matched healthy women served as control (n = 50). The amplification of HER-2/neu gene was determined by PCR amplification using appropriate primers. The amplification of HER-2/neu gene was significantly higher in women with breast cancer as compared with control (P < 0.05). Additionally, there were differences in the amplification status between node-positive and node-negative breast cancer patients. The results suggest that the presence of amplification of HER-2/neu gene may be linked with the appearance and/or progression of breast cancer.",

In HER2+ breast cancer, we found altered DNA methylation in genes involved in multicellular development, differentiation and transcription. Within these genes, we observed an overrepresentation of homeobox family genes, including several genes that have not been previously reported in relation to cancer (DBX1, NKX2-6, SIX6). Other affected genes included several belonging to the PI3K and Wnt signaling pathways. Notably, HER2, AKT3, HK1, and PFKP, genes for which altered methylation has not been previously reported, were also identified in this analysis. In total, we report 69 candidate biomarker genes with maximum differential methylation in HER2+ breast cancer. External validation of gene expression in a selected group of these genes (n = 13) revealed lowered mean gene expression in HER2+ breast cancer. We analyzed DNA methylation in six top candidate genes (AKR1B1, INA, FOXC2, NEUROD1, CDKL2, IRF4) using EpiTect Methyl II Custom PCR Array and confirmed the 450K array findings. Future clinical studies focusing on these genes, as well as on homeobox-containing genes and HER2, AKT3, HK1, and PFKP, are warranted which could provide further insights into the biology of HER2+ breast cancer.

Using immunohistochemical techniques, we examined the expression of PKIB, ER, PR, HER2, and pAkt in 148 primary human breast carcinomas. We then analyzed the relationships between PKIB expression and that of pAkt, ER, PR, and HER2, as well as between PKIB expression and various clinicopathological characteristics. We assessed 64 and 27 cases, respectively, as positive for either PKIB or pAkt expression; 20 cases were positive for both PKIB and pAkt. We observed a significant positive correlation between the expression of PKIB and that of pAkt (P = 0.006).

Recent data suggest, that dual inhibition of ErbB1 (EGFR) and ErbB2 signaling is more efficient in cancer therapy, however, cardiac safety of this therapeutic approach is unknown. We therefore tested an ErbB1-(CGP059326) and an ErbB1/ErbB2-(PKI166) tyrosine kinase inhibitor in an in-vitro system of adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes and assessed their effects on 1. cell viability, 2. myofibrillar structure, 3. contractile function, and 4. MAPK- and Akt-signaling alone or in combination with Doxorubicin. Neither CGP nor PKI induced cardiomyocyte necrosis or apoptosis. PKI but not CGP caused myofibrillar structural damage that was additive to that induced by Doxorubicin at clinically relevant doses. These changes were associated with an inhibition of excitation-contraction coupling. PKI but not CGP decreased p-Erk1/2, suggesting a role for this MAP-kinase signaling pathway in the maintenance of myofibrils. These data indicate that the ErbB2 signaling pathway is critical for the maintenance of myofibrillar structure and function. Clinical studies using ErbB2-targeted inhibitors for the treatment of cancer should be designed to include careful monitoring for cardiac dysfunction.",

The loss of 14-3-3sigma is a common event in breast cancer; however, the role of other 14-3-3s in breast cancer is unclear. Recently, we found that 14-3-3zeta overexpression occurs in early stage breast diseases and contributes to transformation of human mammary epithelial cells. Here, we show that 14-3-3zeta overexpression also persisted in invasive ductal carcinoma and contributed to the further progression of breast cancer. To examine the clinical effect of 14-3-3zeta overexpression in advanced stage breast cancer, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of 14-3-3zeta expression in primary breast carcinomas. 14-3-3zeta overexpression occurred in 42% of breast tumors and was determined to be an independent prognostic factor for reduced disease-free survival. 14-3-3zeta overexpression combined with ErbB2 overexpression and positive lymph node status identified a subgroup of patients at high risk for developing distant metastasis. To investigate whether 14-3-3zeta overexpression causally promotes breast cancer progression, we overexpressed 14-3-3zeta by stable transfection or reduced 14-3-3zeta expression by siRNA in cancer cell lines. Increased 14-3-3zeta expression enhanced anchorage-independent growth and inhibited stress-induced apoptosis, whereas down-regulation of 14-3-3zeta reduced anchorage-independent growth and sensitized cells to stress-induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Transient blockade of 14-3-3zeta expression by siRNA in cancer cells effectively reduced the onset and growth of tumor xenografts in vivo. Therefore, 14-3-3zeta overexpression is a novel molecular marker for disease recurrence in breast cancer patients and may serve as an effective therapeutic target in patients whose tumors overexpress 14-3-3zeta.",

The aims of this study were to provide a detailed molecular genetic analysis of the 17q12-q21 amplicon in breast cancers harbouring HER2/TOP2A co-amplification and to investigate additional recurrent co-amplifications in HER2/TOP2A-co-amplified cancers. In total, 15 breast cancers with HER2 amplification, 10 of which also harboured TOP2A amplification, as defined by chromogenic in situ hybridisation, and 6 breast cancer cell lines known to be amplified for HER2 were subjected to high-resolution microarray-based comparative genomic hybridisation analysis. This revealed that the genomes of 12 cases were characterised by at least one localised region of clustered, relatively narrow peaks of amplification, with each cluster confined to a single chromosome arm (ie 'firestorm' pattern) and 3 cases displayed many narrow segments of duplication and deletion affecting the vast majority of chromosomes (ie 'sawtooth' pattern). The smallest region of amplification (SRA) on 17q12 in the whole series extended from 34.73 to 35.48 Mb, and encompassed HER2 but not TOP2A. In HER2/TOP2A-co-amplified samples, the SRA extended from 34.73 to 36.54 Mb, spanning a region of approximately 1.8 Mb. Apart from HER2 and TOP2A, this region encompassed four additional genes whose expression levels as defined by quantitative real-time PCR are significantly higher in HER2/TOP2A-co-amplified vs HER2-amplified breast cancers: CASC3, CDC6, RARA and SMARCE1. Of the cell lines studied, SKBR3 and UACC812 showed HER2/TOP2A co-amplification. In conclusion, this is the first detailed genome-wide characterisation of HER2/TOP2A-amplified breast cancers; cell lines were identified that can be used to model these cancers in vitro. The 17q12 amplicon is complex and harbours multiple genes that may be associated with breast cancer development and progression, and potentially exploitable as therapeutic targets.",

Agents that target estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 are among the most successful cancer therapeutics. However, de novo or acquired resistance is common, despite the development of newer agents against these pathways. As our understanding of tumor biology improves, novel targets are being identified. Notably, inhibitors against several pathways [including, among others, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR), cell-cycle regulation, heat shock protein, and epigenetic pathways] have demonstrated promising activity in clinical trials, and the mTOR-inhibitor everolimus has been approved for advanced or metastatic aromatase inhibitor-resistant ER(+) breast cancer. At present, there are no established targeted agents for triple-negative breast cancer (negative ER, progesterone receptor, and HER2). Although poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors have shown promising activity in BRCA-related cancers, its value in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancers remains to be demonstrated.

First, breast cancers express multiple putative tumor-associated antigens, such as HER-2 and MUC-1, which have been the successful focus of vaccine development over the past decade, translating into tumor-specific immune responses and, in some cases, clinical benefit. Second, passive immune strategies with anti-HER-2 antibodies, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab, have led to survival benefits in breast cancer. Finally, the successes observed with novel immunotherapeutic strategies, such as immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive T-cell therapies in other malignancies, combined with a growing body of literature that supports an interplay between solid tumors and the immune system, indicate that these strategies have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of breast cancer.

Interestingly, an inverse relation between ER, PR and HER-2/neu was apparent in 41.2% (p<0.0001) of the tumors, of which 24.5% (p<0.0001) were ER and PR co-negative but HER-2 positive.;ER and PR positive tumors are less common (i.e<30%) compared to HER-2/neu positive tumors (i.e>50%) in Indian breast cancer patients, underlining the need for effective diagnostic screening and specific therapeutic managements in order to improve the survival rate of patients in low resource countries such as India.",

Recent studies show that aberrant activation of Akt in breast carcinoma is associated with a poor prognosis and resistance to endocrine therapy and chemotherapy. The Akt signaling pathway is currently attracting considerable attention as a new target for effective therapeutic strategies. We investigated the incidence of Akt activation in 252 primary breast carcinomas and relationships among the activation of Akt, HER2 overexpression, hormone receptor expression, and alteration of the PTEN gene. Eighty-four cases (33.3%) were positive for pAkt expression. pAkt was significantly associated with HER2 overexpression (p<0.0001) and LOH at the PTEN gene locus (p<0.01). There was an inverse correlation between pAkt and PR (p<0.05). We also retrospectively examined the relationship between Akt activation and the efficacy of endocrine therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Of these 36 metastatic breast cancer cases, 12 cases (33.4%) were considered to show positive pAkt expression. In the pAkt-positive patients, endocrine therapy demonstrated worse efficacy than in pAkt-negative patients (p<0.01). In addition, the clinical benefit was the smallest in the patients positive both for HER2 and pAkt (p<0.01). The clinical benefit rate of estrogen deprivation therapy with AI or LH-RH agonist was significantly lower in the pAkt-positive patients than that in the pAkt-negative ones (p<0.05), and there was a tendency for the clinical benefit of SERM to be smaller in the pAkt-positive patients (p=0.09). These findings therefore suggest that Akt activation induces endocrine resistance in metastatic breast cancer, irrespective of the kind of endocrine agents that were administered. Our findings indicate that the activation of Akt in the downstream pathway of HER2 plays an important role in resistance to endocrine therapy for breast cancer. Our findings suggest that pAkt may be a useful predictor of resistance to endocrine therapy for breast cancer, while also suggesting that the inhibition of Akt may increase the efficacy of endocrine therapy.",

In this proteomic study, to identify the proteins that are associated with the aggressive phenotype of HER-2/neu-positive breast cancer, tumor cells from both HER-2/neu-positive and -negative tumors were procured by laser capture microdissection. Differentially expressed proteins in the two subsets of tumors were identified by two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS. We found differential expression of several key cell cycle modulators, which were linked with increased proliferation of the HER-2/neu-overexpressing cells. Nine proteins involved in glycolysis (triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), and enolase 1 (ENO1)), lipid synthesis (fatty acid synthase (FASN)), stress-mediated chaperonage (heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27)), and antioxidant and detoxification pathways (haptoglobin, aldo-keto reductase (AKR), glyoxalase I (GLO), and prolyl-4-hydrolase beta-isoform (P4HB)) were found to be up-regulated in HER-2/neu-positive breast tumors. HER-2/neu-dependent differential expression of PGK1, FASN, Hsp27, and GLO was further validated in four breast cancer cell lines and 12 breast tumors by immunoblotting and confirmed by partially switching off the HER-2/neu signaling in the high HER-2/neu-expressing SKBr3 cell line with Herceptin treatment. Statistical correlations of these protein expressions with HER-2/neu status were further verified by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray comprising 97 breast tumors. Our findings suggest that HER-2/neu signaling may result, directly or indirectly, in enhanced activation of various metabolic, stress-responsive, antioxidative, and detoxification processes within the breast tumor microenvironment. We hypothesize that these identified changes in the cellular proteome are likely to drive cell proliferation and tissue invasion and that the key cell cycle modulators involved, when uncovered by future research, would serve as naturally useful targets for the development of therapeutic strategies to negate the metastatic potential of HER-2/neu-positive breast tumors.",

Trastuzumab was conjugated to bifunctional chelator, DOTA, and characterized for integrity and the number of molecules conjugated. Radiolabeling of DOTA-conjugated trastuzumab was optimized using Lu-177. Quality control parameters including radiochemical purity, stability, sterility, pyrogenicity and immunoreactivity were assessed. A preliminary pilot study was conducted on breast cancer patients (n = 6 HER2 positive and n = 4 HER2 negative) to evaluate the ability of Lu-177-trastuzumab for HER2 specific tumor targeting. The conjugates were efficiently labeled with Lu-177 with high radiochemical purity (up to 91%) and specific activity (6-13 µCi/µg). Lu-177-trastuzumab was stable up to 12 hr post labeling. The radioimmunoassay demonstrated good antigen binding ability and specificity for HER2 receptor protein. The patient studies showed the localization of Lu-177-trastuzumab at primary as well as metastatic sites (HER2 positive) in the planar and SPECT/CT images. No tracer uptake was observed in HER2 negative patients that indicated the specificity of Lu-177-trastuzumab.

In this study, the responsiveness to tamoxifen in the BT/HerR, Herceptin-resistant BT cell lines established through constant Herceptin exposure, was evaluated. Compared with BT cells, improvement of sensitivity to tamoxifen in BT/HerR was demonstrated by ER functional analysis and cell proliferation assay. Tamoxifen in the resistant cell line was found to inhibit 17beta-estradiol-stimulating estrogen-responsive gene pS2 expression more effectively than in BT cells in real-time PCR assay. Western blot analysis showed that cross-phosphorylation between ER and downstream components of ERBB2 was attenuated in BT/HerR cells. ER redistribution from cytoplasm to nucleus could be found in these cells through immunofluorescence and confocal studies, and importantly, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that tamoxifen induced occupancy of the pS2 promoter by ER and nuclear receptor corepressor (NCOR1) instead of coactivator NCOA3 in these cells. Finally, combination of tamoxifen and Herceptin was found to improve the sensitivity of BT/HerR cells to Herceptin. Our results suggest that the ER genomic pathway in the ER-positive and Herceptin-resistant breast cancer cells may be reactivated, allowing tamoxifen therapy to be effective again, and a combination of tamoxifen and Herceptin can be a potential therapeutic strategy for ER-positive and Herceptin-resistant human breast cancer.",

We have previously reported that the adenovirus type 5 early region 1A (E1A) gene product can repress HER-2/neu overexpression by repressing HER-2/neu promoter activity, and suppress the tumorigenic potential of HER-2/neu-overexpressing ovarian cancer cells. To examine E1A tumor suppressor function in breast cancer, we transduced E1A in vitro by adenovirus into both HER-2/neu-overexpressing and low expressing human breast cancer cell lines. In HER-2/neu-overexpressing cells, E1A greatly inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro. However, in HER-2/neu low expressing cancer cell lines, E1A had no significant effect on cell growth in culture medium. To test the therapeutic efficacy of E1A, we used both adenovirus-mediated and cationic liposome-mediated E1A gene delivery systems in an orthotopic breast cancer animal model. An advanced breast cancer model was established by inoculation of HER-2/neu-overexpressing human breast cancer cells in mammary fat pad and treated by local injections of either replication-deficient adenovirus expressing E1A, Ad.E1A(+) or a liposome-E1A DNA complex. As controls, mice bearing tumors were also treated with Ad.E1A(-) which is virtually the same adenovirus as Ad.E1A(+) except that E1A is deleted, a liposome-E1A frame-shift mutant DNA complex, or just PBS. In mice bearing a HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cell line, E1A delivered either by adenovirus or liposome significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged mouse survival compared with the controls. In fact, 60-80% of E1A-treated mice lived longer than 2 years versus only 0-20% of control mice (P<0.05). Western blot analysis showed that E1A protein was expressed in tumor tissue and immunohistochemical analysis showed that HER-2/neu p185 protein expression was suppressed. Taken together, our results indicated that both adenovirus and cationic liposome delivery systems were effective in transfering E1A gene for tumor suppression in a HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer model.",

Because signaling molecules and pathways cooperate to drive cancer progression, simultaneous targeting of multiple pathways is an appealing therapeutic strategy. With this in mind, we examined breast tumor cells for their sensitivity to the ErbB2 and FGFR inhibitors, PKI166 and PD173074, respectively. Simultaneous blocking of ErbB2 and FGFR-4 in MDA-MB-453 tumor cells had a stronger anti-proliferative effect than treatment with individual inhibitors. Examination of cell cycle regulators revealed a novel translation-mediated mechanism whereby ErbB2 and FGFR-4 cooperate to regulate cyclin D1 levels. Our results showed that FGFR-4 and ErbB2 via the MAPK and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathways, respectively, both contribute to the maintenance of constitutive activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin translational pathway. Dual inhibition of these receptors strongly blocked S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) activity and cyclin D1 translation, as attested by a decrease in cyclin D1 mRNA association with polysomes. Ectopic expression of active protein kinase B or active S6K1 abrogated the dual inhibitor-mediated down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression, demonstrating the importance of these FGFR-4/ErbB2 signaling targets in regulating cyclin D1 translation. S6K1 has the central role in this process, since small interfering RNA-targeted S6K1 depletion led to a decrease in cellular S6K1 activity and, as a consequence, repression of cyclin D1 expression. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism for controlling cyclin D1 expression downstream of combined activity of ErbB2 and FGFR-4 that involves S6K1-mediated translation.",

Deregulation of autophagy is involved in the progression of cancer. However, the predictive value of autophagy for breast cancer prognosis remains unclear. First, based on gene expression profiling, we found that autophagy genes were implicated in breast cancer. Then, using the Cox proportional hazard regression model, we detected autophagy prognostic signature for breast cancer in a training dataset. We identified a set of eight autophagy genes (BCL2, BIRC5, EIF4EBP1, ERO1L, FOS, GAPDH, ITPR1 and VEGFA) that were significantly associated with overall survival in breast cancer. The eight autophagy genes were assigned as a autophagy-related prognostic signature for breast cancer. Based on the autophagy-related signature, the training dataset GSE21653 could be classified into high-risk and low-risk subgroups with significantly different survival times (HR = 2.72, 95% CI = (1.91, 3.87); P = 1.37 × 10(-5)). Inactivation of autophagy was associated with shortened survival of breast cancer patients. The prognostic value of the autophagy-related signature was confirmed in the testing dataset GSE3494 (HR = 2.12, 95% CI = (1.48, 3.03); P = 1.65 × 10(-3)) and GSE7390 (HR = 1.76, 95% CI = (1.22, 2.54); P = 9.95 × 10(-4)). Further analysis revealed that the prognostic value of the autophagy signature was independent of known clinical prognostic factors, including age, tumor size, grade, estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, ERBB2 status, lymph node status and TP53 mutation status.

Cells responsive to lapatinib exhibited strong differential effects on multiple genes in the AKT pathway. After 12 h of exposure to 1.0 micromol/L of lapatinib, AKT1, MAPK9, HSPCA, IRAK1, and CCND1 transcripts were down-regulated 7- to 25-fold in responsive BT474 and SKBr3 cells. In contrast, lapatinib weakly down-regulated the AKT pathway in nonresponsive breast cancer cell lines (<5-fold down-regulation of most genes in the pathway). Furthermore, the proapoptotic gene FOXO3A, which is negatively regulated by AKT, was up-regulated 7- and 25-fold in lapatinib-responsive SKBr3 and BT474 cells, respectively. Phosphorylated Akt and Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO3A also decreased in responsive breast cancer cell lines exposed to lapatinib. Gene expression profiling also revealed that lapatinib stimulated the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and modulated the expression of genes involved in cell cycle control, glycolysis, and fatty acid metabolism. In BT474 and T47D cells, which expressed moderate basal levels of the estrogen and progesterone receptors, 1.0 micromol/L of lapatinib induced expression by 7- to 11-fold. These data provide insight into the mechanism of action of lapatinib in breast cancer cells.",

To circumvent this problem, we conjugated the NH2 groups of Trastuzumab with biotin, and the compound obtained, designated BiotHER, was added directly to tissue sections. Biotin-labelling was revealed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Specificity and sensitivity of BiotHER immunostaining with respect to HER-2 amplification were tested on 164 breast carcinoma samples. BiotHER staining was detected on the tumour cell membrane of 12% of all specimens and in 49% specimens with gene amplification, while absent in nonamplified tumours. Predictivity of BiotHER status with respect to the clinical outcome was analysed in 54 patients with HER-2 amplified advanced breast cancer treated with Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy. BiotHER staining, detected in 50% of tumours with HER-2 amplification, was an independent predictor of clinical outcome. In fact, BiotHER positivity was independently associated with increased likelihood of tumour response and reduced risk of tumour progression and death. Biotinylated Trastuzumab can thus be used for immunohistochemical detection of HER-2 overexpression in breast cancer, and has the potential to identify patients likely to benefit from Trastuzumab treatment.",

However, a large proportion of patients with breast cancer have intrinsic resistance to HER2-targeted therapies, and nearly all become resistant to therapy after initial response. Elucidation of underlying mechanisms contributing to HER2 resistance has led to development of novel therapeutic strategies, including those targeting HER2 and downstream pathways, heat shock protein 90, telomerase, and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors. Numerous clinical trials are ongoing or completed, including phase 3 data for the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus in patients with HER2-resistant breast cancer.

To explore the potential of exogenously applied miRNAs to suppress oncogenic proteins, the ERBB oncogene family was chosen with a bioinformatics search identifying targeting seed sequences for miR-125a and miR-125b within the 3'-untranslated regions of both ERBB2 and ERBB3. Using the human breast cancer cell line SKBR3 as a model for ERBB2 and ERBB3 dependence, infection of these cells with retroviral constructs expressing either miR-125a or miR-125b resulted in suppression of ERBB2 and ERBB3 at both the transcript and protein level. Luciferase constructs containing the 3' 3'-untranslated regions of ERBB2 and ERBB3 demonstrated approximately 35% less activity in miR-125a- and miR-125b-expressing cells relative to controls. Additionally, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT was suppressed in SKBR3 cells overexpressing either miR-125a or miR-125b. Consistent with suppression of both ERBB2 and ERBB3 signaling, miR-125a-or miR-125b-overexpressing SKBR3 cells were impaired in their anchorage-dependent growth and exhibited reduced migration and invasion capacities. Parallel studies performed on MCF10A cells demonstrated that miR-125a or miR-125b overexpression produced only marginal influences on the growth and migration of these non-transformed human mammary epithelial cells. These results illustrate the feasibility of using miRNAs as a therapeutic strategy to suppress oncogene expression and function.",

Heterodimer interactions between HER-2 and HER-3 (erbB-3) are activated by neu differentiation factor/heregulin (HRG), and HER-2/HER-3 heterodimers are constitutively activated in breast cancer cells with HER-2 gene amplification. This indicates that inhibition of HER-2/HER-3 heterodimer function may be an especially effective and unique strategy for blocking the HER-2-mediated transformation of breast cancer cells. Therefore, we constructed a bicistronic retroviral expression vector (pCMV-dn3) containing a dominant negative form of HER-3 in which most of the cytoplasmic domain was removed for introduction into cells. By using a bicistronic retroviral vector in which the antibiotic resistance gene and the gene of interest are driven by a single promoter, we attained 100% coordinate coexpression of antibiotic resistance with the gene of interest in target cell populations. Breast carcinoma cells with HER-2 gene amplification (21 MT-1 cells) and normal mammary epithelial cells without HER-2 gene amplification from the same patient (H16N-2 cells) were infected with pCMV-dn3 and assessed for HER-2/ HER-3 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, p85PI 3-kinase and SHC protein activation, growth factor-dependent and -independent proliferation, and transformed growth in culture. Dominant negative HER-3 inhibited the HRG-induced activation of HER-2/HER-3 and signaling in H16N-2 and 21 MT-1 cells as well as the constitutive activation of HER-2/HER-3 and signaling in 21 MT-1 cells. Responses to exogenous HRG were strongly inhibited by dominant negative HER-3. In contrast, the proliferation of cells stimulated by epidermal growth factor was not apparently affected by dominant negative HER-3. The growth factor-independent proliferation and transformed growth of 21 MT-1 cells were also strongly inhibited by dominant negative HER-3 in anchorage-dependent and independent growth assays in culture. Furthermore, the HRG-induced or growth factor-independent proliferation of 21 MT-1 cells was inhibited by dominant negative HER-3, whereas the epidermal growth factor-induced proliferation of these cells was not: this indicates that dominant negative HER-3 preferentially inhibits proliferation induced by HER-2/HER-3.",

Treatment of SKBr3 (ERBB2-amplified), MDA-MB-361 (ERBB2-amplified, metastatic brain tumor-derived) and MCF7 (HER2-positive, not ERBB2-amplified) cells with exogenous heregulin increased proliferation and adhesive potential, concomitant with induction of cyclin D1 and ICAM-1, and suppression of p27. All three cell lines invaded through matrigel toward a heregulin chemotactic signal in transwell experiments, associated with activation of extracellular cathepsin B and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Moreover, heregulin induced breast cancer cell transmigration across a tight barrier of primary human brain microvascular endothelia. This was dependent on the activity of HER2, HER3 and MMPs, and was completely abrogated by combination HER2-HER3 blockade using Herceptin® and the humanized HER3 monoclonal antibody, EV20.

The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test was used to identify genes with a significant difference in expression between CAW and AAW. To determine if the differentially expressed genes could segregate between the CAW and AAW, we performed semi-supervised principal component analysis (SSPCA).;Twenty genes were differentially expressed between AAW and CAW. SSPCA incorporating these 20 genes segregated AAW and CAW into two distinct groups. AAW were significantly (p < 0.05) more likely to display aberrations in G(1)/S cell-cycle regulatory genes, decreased expression of cell-adhesion genes, and low to no expression of ESR1, PGR, ERBB2 and estrogen pathway targets.;The gene expression differences identified between AAW and CAW may contribute to more aggressive disease, resistance to therapy, enhanced metastatic potential and poor clinical outcome. These findings support the hypothesis that breast cancer specimens collected from AAW display distinct gene expression differences compared to similar tissues obtained from CAW.

Our lab recently reported that HER2+ breast cancers also exhibit sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (PARPi) by attenuating the NF-κB pathway. In this study, we assessed PARP1 and phospho-p65, a marker of activated NF-κB levels in human breast cancer tissues. PARP1 and PARP2 copy number, mRNA, and protein expression was assessed by interrogating the PAM-50 defined breast cancer patient set from the TCGA using cBioPortal. PARP1 and phospho-p65 immunohistochemistry and correlation to clinical parameters was conducted using 307 primary breast cancer specimens (132 basal, 82 luminal, 93 HER2+) through univariate and multivariate analyses. In the PAM50 breast cancer data set, PARP1 and 2 expression was altered in 24/58 (41 %) HER2+, 32/81 (40 %) basal, and 75/324 (23 %) luminal A/B breast cancer patients. This correlated with a statistically significant increase in PARP1 protein levels in HER2+ and basal but not luminal breast cancers (p = 0.003, p = 0.027, p = 0.289, respectively). No change in PARP2 protein level was observed. Interestingly, using breast cancer specimens from 307 patients, HER2 positivity correlated with elevated PARP1 expression (p < 0.0001) and was three times more likely than HER2 negative breast cancers to exhibit high PARP1 levels. No significant differences were noted between race, ER status, or PR status for PARP1 expression. Additionally, we found a significant correlation between HER2 status and phospho-p65 expression (p < 0.0001). Lastly, a direct correlation between PARP1 and phospho-p65 (p < 0.0001) was noted. These results indicate a potential connection between HER2, PARP1, and phospho-p65. Furthermore, these data suggest that the PARPi sensitivity we previously observed in HER2+ breast cancer cells may be due to elevated PARP1 expression.",

However, resistances to trastuzumab frequently occur, and novel strategies/agents are urgently needed to abrogate the resistant phenotype. Our current study explores the potential of SNDX-275, a class I HDAC inhibitor, to overcome trastuzumab resistance and investigates the combinational effects of SNDX-275 and trastuzumab on both sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells. Cell proliferation assays showed that SNDX-275 significantly enhanced trastuzumab-induced growth inhibition in trastuzumab-sensitive, erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Importantly, SNDX-275 at its therapeutic range re-sensitized trastuzumab-resistant cells to trastuzumab-mediated growth inhibition. SNDX-275 in combination with trastuzumab resulted in a dramatic reduction of erbB3 and its phosphorylation (P-erbB3), and inhibition of Akt signaling. Apoptotic-ELISA and western blot analyses confirmed that the combinations of SNDX-275 and trastuzumab as compared to SNDX-275 alone significantly enhanced DNA fragmentation and induced more PARP cleavage and caspase-3 activation in both trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer cells. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that SNDX-275 mainly attenuated the interactions of erbB2 and erbB3 receptors, but had no significant effect on erbB2/IGF-1R or erbB3/IGF-1R associations in the trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells. These data indicated that SNDX-275 enhanced trastuzumab efficacy against erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, and exhibited potential to overcome trastuzumab resistance via disrupting erbB2/erbB3 interactions and inactivating PI-3K/Akt signaling. SNDX-275 may be included in erbB2-targeted regimen as a novel strategy to treat breast cancer patients whose tumors overexpress erbB2.",

By comparing the transcriptional profiles of ErbB2(KI) mammary tumors and human ERBB2-positive breast cancers, we show that ErbB2(KI) tumors possess molecular features of the basal subtype of ERBB2-positive human breast cancer, including activation of canonical β-catenin signaling. Inhibition of β-catenin-dependent signaling in ErbB2(KI)-derived tumor cells using RNA interference impaired tumor initiation and metastasis. Furthermore, treatment of ErbB2(KI) or human ERBB2-overexpressing tumor cells with a selective β-catenin/CBP inhibitor significantly decreased proliferation and ErbB2 expression.

We first screened breast cancer cell line representatives of breast cancer subtypes for PKCβII expression at the mRNA and at the protein levels. We analyzed a TMA comprising of tumors from 438 patients with a median followup of 15.4 years for PKCβII expression by immunohistochemistry along with other prognostic factors in breast cancer. Among a panel of human breast cancer cell lines, only MDA-MB-436, a triple negative basal cell line, showed overexpression for PKCβII both at the mRNA and at the protein levels. In breast cancer patients, cytoplasmic expression of PKCβII correlated positively with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2; P = 0.01) and Ki-67 (P = 0.016), while nuclear PKCβII correlated positively with estrogen receptor (ER; P = 0.016).

We analyzed COX-2 expression in human breast cancers (and breast cancer cell lines) and adjacent ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as well as its association with HER2/neu and clinicopathological variables. Archival primary breast carcinomas (n = 57), adjacent DCIS (n = 14) and DCIS alone (n = 2) were analyzed for COX-2 and HER2 expression by immunohistochemistry using specific monoclonal antibodies. An immunohistochemical scoring system was used. HER2 gene amplification had been analyzed previously by fluorescence in situ hybridization (n = 20). Histology of carcinomas included infiltrating ductal (n = 44), lobular (n = 2), and other (n = 7). Frozen breast cancers and adjacent normal tissue pairs (n = 9) were analyzed for COX-2 mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR. COX-2 and HER2 expression were also analyzed in human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MCF-7/HER2, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-231) by immunoblotting. Cytoplasmic COX-2 expression was detected at an intermediate or high level in epithelial cells in 18 of 42 (43%) invasive breast cancers and in 10 of 16 (63%) cases of DCIS. Normal-appearing breast epithelia adjacent to cancer expressed COX-2 in 81% of cases and was generally focal and of similar or decreased intensity relative to adjacent neoplastic epithelia. COX-2 mRNA was detected in all samples analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR and was increased in eight of nine breast cancers relative to paired normal tissue. In archival tumors, no significant correlation was found between COX-2 and HER2 expression/amplification and clinicopathological variables. COX-2 expression was induced in MCF-7 cells stably transfected with HER2, in contrast to parental MCF-7 cells, and was detected in MDA-MB-231, but not SK-BR-3 cells. COX-2 is frequently overexpressed in invasive breast cancers and in adjacent DCIS and, thus, may be an early event in mammary tumorigenesis. Forced HER2 expression in MCF-7 cells was shown to up-regulate COX-2, although no association was found in human tumors.

While 71.4% of advanced breast cancers were positive for SNCG expression, only 26.8% of Stage I/II breast cancers were positive for SNCG expression and 5.2% of benign hyperplasia expressed SNCG. SNCG protein was not detectable in normal tissue adjacent to breast cancer.

Overexpression of these 2 proteins had long been thought to contribute to cancer progression and poor outcomes, thus, therapies targeting HER-2 and VEGFA signaling pathways have been applied in recent years. Herceptin is a HER-2 targeted antibody that being widely used for the management of HER-2 positive breast cancer, which demonstrate significant benefits in both the metastatic and adjuvant settings. However, acquired resistance develops in most treated patients despite treatment in as early as 10 months. Identification of subpopulations best suited for and most likely to respond to Herceptin is of utmost importance. We analyzed the signaling pathways of HER-2 and found that HER-2 shares a very similar downstream network with VEGFA, while LGR5 lies in the upstream of VEGFA and could promotes its expression through CTNNB1. This discovery suggests that the LGR5 directed VEGFA overexpression may activate downstream signals of HER-2 despite Herceptin treatment. Here, we hypothesized that in LGR5 overexpressing breast cancer cases, activation of VEGFA-VRGFR bypass may account for the resistance to HER-2 directed therapies. Concurrent inhibition of VEGFR might enhance Herceptin sensitivity and moreover reverse the resistant phenotype in HER-2 positive breast cancer. Thus, we proposed alternate regimens to increase the efficacy of Herceptin-based therapy. Nevertheless, wet lab experiments and clinical trials are still required.",

Accumulating evidence has shown that these genes act as positive and/or negative modulators in many types of cancer, including breast cancer, in a tissue-specific manner. We have previously reported that HOXB5 is aberrantly overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Here, we investigated the biological roles and clinical relevance of HOXB5 in breast cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis of HOXB5 on tissue microarray (TMA) including 34 normal and 67 breast cancer specimens revealed that HOXB5 was highly expressed in cancer tissues, particularly from estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients. An online survival analysis confirmed the correlation between HOXB5 expression and poor distant metastasis-free survival in ER-positive, but not in ER-negative, breast cancer. In vitro studies indicated that HOXB5 silencing in ER-positive cells significantly decreased cell proliferation and anchorage-independent cell growth. In contrast, overexpression of HOXB5 displayed EMT characteristics with a greater invasive ability, higher cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar. HOXB5 knockdown or overexpression led to changes in the expression levels of RET, ERBB2, and EGFR, but not of ESR1. In conclusion, we suggest that HOXB5 acts as a positive modulator most likely by promoting cell proliferative response and invasiveness in ER-positive breast cancer.

Inhibiting HER2 activity with anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) or HER2 short interfering RNA in tumor cells down-regulates Ang-2 expression. Consistent with the important roles of AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase in the HER2 signaling pathway, AKT and ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase activity is necessary for Ang-2 up-regulation by HER2. Moreover, overexpression of HER2 protein up-regulates Ang-2 expression. Heregulin-beta1-induced Ang-2 up-regulation is abrogated when AKT and ERK kinase activity are blocked. Immunohistochemical analysis of HER2 and Ang-2 proteins in human breast carcinomas shows that Ang-2 expression in breast cancer correlates with HER2 expression.

As yet, however, KLF15 expression analyses in primary human breast cancers have not been reported. Here, we set out to investigate the clinical and biological significance of KLF15 expression in human breast cancers.;KLF15 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 54 primary invasive ductal breast carcinomas, and its status was correlated with various clinicopathological parameters. We also assessed KLF15 expression in vitro in 4 breast cancer-derived cell lines using Western blotting, and examined the effects of exogenous KLF15 expression on cell cycle progression using flow cytometry. Concomitant (changes in) p21, p27 and TOPO2A expression levels were examined using real-time RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry, respectively.;In ~90% of the primary breast carcinoma tissues tested, KLF15 was found to be expressed and localized in either the cytoplasm, the nucleus or both. Predominant nuclear immunoreactivity was found to be associated with clinicopathological factors predicting a better clinical outcome (i.e., ER positive, HER2 negative, low grade, low Ki-67 expression). The breast cancer-derived cell lines tested showed a low KLF15 expression with a predominant cytoplasmic localization. Subsequent exogenous KLF15 over-expression resulted in a predominant nuclear localization and a concomitant decreased cellular proliferation and an arrest at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. In addition, we found that nuclear KLF15 expression results in up-regulation of p21, a pivotal suppressor of the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle.;Our results indicate that nuclear KLF15 expression suppresses breast cancer cell proliferation at least partially through p21 up-regulation and subsequent cell cycle arrest.

This explains a lower response to anti-oestrogens if ER+ breast cancers are HER-2/neu positive.

We therefore hypothesized an age-related association between HER-2/neu and PR in ER+ breast cancers. Receptors for ER, PR and HER-2/neu were analysed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). A uni- and multivariate analyses was carried out to assess this relationship in 1104 women with an ER+ breast cancer. We observed an inverse association between HER-2/neu and PR only after age 45. There were 173 women of age<or=45 and 931 of age>45 years. In multivariate analysis, only tumour grade (p=0.005) but not PR status was associated with HER-2/neu in women age<or=45 years. However, in age>45 years group, both PR status (p=0.001) and tumour grade (p=0.001) were independently associated with HER-2/neu. In ER+ breast cancers from women age>45, PR was positive in 76.9% if HER-2/neu negative but in 53.4% if HER-2/neu positive (p<0.001) and the median quantitative PR levels are 150 and 75 respectively in HER-2/neu negative and HER-2/neu positive tumours (p=0.002).

MP-412 (AV-412) is a potent dual inhibitor of EGFR and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases, including the mutant EGFR(L858R,T790M), which is clinically resistant to the EGFR-specific kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib. In an enzyme assay, MP-412 inhibited the EGFR variants and ErbB2 in the nanomolar range with over 100-fold selectivity compared with other kinases, apart from abl and flt-1, which were both moderately sensitive to the compound. In cells, MP-412 inhibited autophosphorylation of EGFR and ErbB2 with IC(50) of 43 and 282 nM, respectively. It also inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent cell proliferation with an IC(50) of 100 nM. Moreover, MP-412 abrogated EGFR signaling in the gefitinib-resistant H1975 cell line, which harbors a double mutation of L858R and T790M in EGFR. In animal studies using cancer xenograft models, MP-412 (30 mg/kg) demonstrated complete inhibition of tumor growth of the A431 and BT-474 cell lines, which overexpress EGFR and ErbB2, respectively. MP-412 suppressed autophosphorylation of EGFR and ErbB2 at the dose corresponding to its antitumor efficacy. When various dosing schedules were applied, MP-412 showed significant effects with daily and every-other-day schedules, but not with a once-weekly schedule, suggesting that frequent dosing is preferable for this compound. Furthermore, MP-412 showed a significant antitumor effect on the ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer KPL-4 cell line, which is resistant to gefitinib. These studies indicate that MP-412 has potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancers expressing EGFR and ErbB2, especially those resistant to the first generation of small-molecule inhibitors.",

In Chile, breast cancer ranks third among cancer mortality rates. Two-hundred and eighty-three breast cancer patients registered at the Gustavo Fricke Hospital of Viña del Mar, Chile, were studied to assess the influence of several factors on the recurrence and survival of breast cancer patients. Patients selected had 5-year post-surgery recurrences of breast cancer and had an average of 58.5 years of age. The variables considered in these patients were the quadrants involved, stage of the tumor, type of recurrence, type of exams, type of surgery, the grade of tumor in relation to Broder's classification and pathology of tumor. The results indicated that the superior external right and left quadrants, Stage IIA, loco-regional recurrences, lumpectomies with axillar lymph node removal and after 5 years, Grade II were prevalent in this population. Among the pathologies analyzed, the ductal carcinomas were the most commonly found and were positive for PCNA, beta-catenin, cytokeratin 18 and ErbB2 protein expression. A median follow-up of 60 months of survival was achieved in 95% of patients. However, those cases with a recurrence of breast cancer had only 40% survival. The risk of mortality was significantly greater when recurrence was present (P<0.0001). The global probability of survival of the patients reached 72% after 5 years. It can be concluded that early detection of breast cancer allows for control of the disease and avoids remissions, or at least extends survival.",

A polymorphism in the HER2 gene (I655V) has been associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer in some ethnic groups. METHODS Subjects from a community-based study of 5318 Ashkenazim from the Washington, DC area were selected for analysis of the I655V HER2 germline polymorphism. We estimated age-specific breast cancer risk from HER2 I655V based on the family history data, using the female first-degree relatives of the study participants and a novel extension of the kin cohort method. RESULTS The estimated cumulative risk of breast cancer to age 70 was approximately 30% higher among HER2 I655V carriers than noncarriers (RR = 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-1.83). The effect of the allele seems stronger at younger ages (among women younger than 50 years, RR = 2.11; CI = 1.39-3.28) and especially among younger women with a family history of breast cancer (RR = 8.9; CI = 1.9-19.7). Increased risk of breast cancer associated with the I655V allele was also observed among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, although these results are based on small numbers. CONCLUSION These analyses suggest that the HER2 valine allele might be associated with increased risk of breast cancer, especially in young women and in women with a family history of the disease.",

To target breast cancer cells that overexpress HER-2/neu mRNA, we previously described a novel strategy that combines the principle of antisense (AS) and translational inhibitory activity conferred by an iron-responsive element (IRE) (AS-IRE). Here, we showed that three potential AS-IREs, i.e. AS-IRE1, 4, and 5, derived from HER-2/neu antisense sequence could bind endogenous iron regulatory protein (IRP) and, when placed in 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of a reporter gene, the gene expression could be translationally repressed by recombinant IRP in vitro. Using AS-IRE4 as our model, we demonstrated that it is regulated by iron, and importantly, such regulation is impaired in HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we showed that AS-IRE4 could preferentially direct the expression of a reporter gene in HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Interestingly, when AS-IRE4 was placed in 5'UTR of Bax gene, a pro-apoptotic protein in the Bcl-2 protein family, we observed a preferential cell killing in breast cancer cells that overexpress HER-2/neu. Taken together, our results suggest that AS-IRE behaves as a functional IRE and it may direct therapeutic gene expression to preferentially target HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells.",

We have analysed two series of data from Institut Curie (Paris and Saint-Cloud). In women younger than 65 years, with HER2 negative breast carcinoma, median survival was 7.1 months. In women older than 65 years, median survival was 4 months.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Breast cancer is characterized by hormone dependency, and endocrine therapy is a key treatment in breast cancer. Recently, targeted therapies such as Trastuzumab treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer has been important. Triple-negative (TN) breast cancer is characterized by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR), and the absence of HER2 protein overexpression, and so there is no targeted therapy for this subtype. In this study, we examined the biological and prognostic characteristics in TN breast cancer.;Between January 1998 and September 2006, 1,552 patients with primary breast cancer were investigated retrospectively in this study and ER, PgR and HER2 status were evaluated in all cases. Furthermore, p53 overexpression and Ki67 values were examined immunohistochemically.;Patient distribution according to ER, PgR or HER2 status was as follows: ER and PgR positive: 57.9%, and ER and PgR negative: 25.1%. With regards to the HER2 status, HER2 positive was 23.3%, and triple negative (TN) was 14.0%. TN breast cancer has a high proliferation rate, high nuclear grade and frequent p53 overexpression. Patients with TN tumors had a significantly poorer disease-free survival (DFS) than those with non-TN tumors. After recurrence the overall survival (OS) rate in TN cases was significantly lower than that of the non-TN cases. Multivariate analysis revealed that TN was a significant factor for DFS and OS after recurrence.;TN breast cancer is a rare subtype with a high proliferation rate and a high nuclear grade, p53 overexpression, and lower DFS/OS. To improve the prognosis of TN breast cancer, a new effective strategy needs to be developed.",

For the HER2 Ile(655)Val, we found similar allele frequencies between cases and controls (frequency of I allele was 0.92 and 0.91, respectively). The same was observed for the noncoding SNP (rs903506). These two SNPs also showed no association with any clinical parameters, except the association of HER2 Ile(655)Val with tumor size (p = 0.002). But, a significant association was found between the short tandem repeat (STR) [H(AC)I4] and breast cancer risk at both genotypic and allelic levels (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.0001, respectively). Multivariate analysis with binary logistic regression of disease status on genotypes of the three polymorphisms confirmed the association of STR with breast cancer risk (p = 0.016).

The human MLN64 and ERBB2 genes are positioned at less than 50 kb from each other, on chromosome 17q12. To understand the molecular basis of MLN64 overexpression in cancer, the genomic region containing the MLN64 and ERBB2 genes was isolated and mapped. The two genes, DARPP32 and Telethonin, flanking MLN64 respectively on its centromeric and telomeric sides, although coamplified, are not overexpressed in breast cancer cells, indicating that gene amplification is not sufficient to allow overexpression. The MLN64 minimal promoter was isolated and found to be a housekeeping gene promoter containing four potential Sp1 binding elements. Using Sp1-deficient Drosophila SL2 cells, MLN64 promoter activity was induced in a dose-dependent manner by exogenous Sp1 addition. Furthermore, mutation of each individual Sp1 element resulted in a significant decrease in reporter gene activity, indicating that all the Sp1 binding elements are functional and act together to promote gene expression. Since the ERBB2 promoter is also positively regulated by Sp1, this study indicates that MLN64 and ERBB2 genes share common transcriptional controls together with a physical link on chromosome 17q. We speculate that, in addition to the oncogenic potential of erbB-2 overexpression, the unbalanced action of MLN64 contributes to the poor clinical outcome of breast tumors bearing this amplified region.",

A PRL receptor (PRLR) antagonist, G129R, has been developed, which indirectly inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2 (p-HER2) in human breast cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigate the effects of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) upon this molecular cross-talk using tumor cells and CAFs derived from spontaneous mammary tumors of female MMTV-neu transgenic mice. Tumors were resected and cultured as small tumor chunks (~3 mm3) or were cultured in monolayer. G129R reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Neu (p-Neu) in a dose-dependent manner (IC50~10 μg/ml) in tumor chunks, but had no effect on primary tumor epithelial cells grown in monolayer. Direct co-culture of mouse or human tumor epithelial cell lines with CAFs restored the epithelial cells' response to G129R, similar to that observed in mouse tumor chunks. The addition of PRL, as expected, induced p-Neu in both the tumor chunk and co-culture models. The inhibitory effect of G129R was absent when CAFs were physically separated from mouse tumor epithelial cells using a transwell system, or when CAFs were replaced with normal fibroblasts in direct co-culture with human or mouse tumor epithelial cells. In vivo, G129R reduced p-Neu levels in primary mammary tumors of mice in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, CAFs play a critical role in bridging the cross-talk between PRL and HER2/Neu in both mouse and human models of breast cancer. The inhibitory effects of G129R on p-Neu and on tumor growth are dependent upon interactions of tumor epithelial cells with CAFs.",

Moreover, an analysis of genes correlated to steroid receptors and ERBB2 suggested a prominent role for the androgen receptor in MBC with a minor relevance for progesterone receptor and ERBB2, although, similarly to FBC, a genomic amplification could be observed. Our findings support the idea that breast cancer is a quite different disease in male and female patients and the underlying gender-related biological differences are likely to have clinical implications connected with different susceptibility to treatment.",

We found that erbB2 molecules homoassociate in unstimulated SK-BR-3, BT474 and BT474-M (a metastatic version of the parent BT474 line) breast tumor cells, and that the interaction was enhanced by EGF treatment in suspensions of SK-BR-3 and BT474-M cells. BT474 cells (with low EGF receptor expression) and attached SK-BR-3 cells do not respond to EGF. Image microscopic energy transfer measurements found considerable pixel-by-pixel heterogeneity in the homoassociation state of erbB2. In accordance with the EGF-induced redistribution of erbB2, EGF receptor was found to be in close proximity to erbB2 in FRET measurements. By labeling different epitopes on erbB2 and the lipid bilayer, we were able to prepare an epitope map of erbB2 molecule.

Dose-response studies, biochemical and cytometric assessment of the effect of OOS on cell cycle and apoptosis, and drug combination analyses were performed on BT474 and SKBR3 cells, 2 HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines. OOS reduced the proliferation of these cells, and augmented the action of lapatinib, a HER2 inhibitor used in the breast cancer clinic. Moreover, OOS decreased growth of HER2+ tumors in mice. Mechanistically, OOS provoked cell cycle blockade through upregulation of p27 expression and downregulation of cyclin D levels. OOS also caused apoptotic cell death in HER2+ breast cancer cells, as indicated by increases in PARP cleavage as well as upregulation of caspase 8 and caspase 3 activities. These results demonstrate an antitumoral action of OOS in preclinical models of HER2+ breast cancer and suggest that it can be used with anti-HER2 therapies currently adopted as standard of care in the oncology clinic.

We evaluated various fixation protocols for optimal receptor testing by immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry (ICC) of human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (ER/PR positive) and SKBR-3 (overexpressing HER-2). The cells were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin or Saccomanno Fixative (SF) for various time points, and either embedded in paraffin as cell blocks or prepared as cytospins. ER and PR slides were assigned a proportion score (PS; 0-5), an intensity score (IS; 0-3) and a total score (TS = PS + IS). Standard DAKO scoring system ranging from 0 to 3+ was used for the evaluation of HER-2 staining. Human breast cancer cells stained successfully for ER, PR and HER-2 when fixed in formalin and prepared as cell blocks. The optimal fixation time for formalin-fixed cells ranged from 2 to 96 hours. Cells fixed in SF from 2 to 96 hours also stained well for ER and PR. However, SF produced variable results for HER-2 staining; particularly, SF fixation beyond 24 hours caused false negative results. The interpretation of HER-2 staining on cytospins was not feasible irrespective of the fixative and fixation time. In summary, formalin fixation from 2 to 96 hours and preparation of cells as cell blocks produces optimal results for ER, PR, and HER-2 testing in human breast cancer cells.",

The identification and cloning of the BRCA1 gene is imminent, and will facilitate the screening and counselling of families at risk of breast cancer, and in the longer term may open up new therapeutic possibilities. The tumour suppressor gene TP53 is mutated in 25%-40% of cases of sporadic breast cancer, and is associated with an aggressive tumour phenotype and poor prognosis in both node-positive and node-negative cases. The pattern of mutations in this tumour suppressor gene shows a higher than expected frequency of G to T transversions, mostly restricted to the highly conserved domain in exons 5 to 8. In many, but not all cases, point mutation of one allele is accompanied by deletion of the remaining normal allele at chromosome 17p13. Abnormalities of TP53 appear to be relatively early events in tumorigenesis, being present in ductal carcinoma in situ lesions. The retinoblastoma gene RB1 shows a variety of abnormalities in about 20% of breast cancers, and there may be an association with TP53 mutations. Other abnormalities which occur with a particularly high incidence in breast cancer include allele loss at chromosome 1p/1q, 3p, 6q, 11p, 16q and 18q.

Although the survival of patients with IBC has been greatly improved by the use of combined treatment modalities, women with IBC still have lower survival rates. We have summarized a single-center experience involving IBC patients. Our objectives are to clarify molecular alterations of HER-2/neu and p53 in IBC and to investigate the prognostic factors.;Between January 1990 and December 2000, 57 patients with IBC were referred to the Cancer Institute Hospital of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research. The incidence of IBC among primary breast cancers was 1.0% (57/5,757) in our hospital. Forty-six patients meeting Haagensen's criteria for inflammatory breast carcinoma were evaluated. All patients had biopsy-proven carcinomas but no distant metastases at referral. The median age at diagnosis for IBC was 51.8 (range, 28 to 70). All patients underwent a mastectomy. Chemotherapy was performed pre- or post-operatively. Three-year and 5-year survival rates were 56.5%, and 40.7%, respectively. Expressions of HER-2/neu and the p53 protein were determined retrospectively by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of thin paraffin-embedded sections of primary tumors.;Of 46 patients, 23 (50.0%) with tumors testing positive for HER-2/neu fared somewhat worse than those with negative tumors, but the differences were not significant for either overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS). Of 46 patients, 19 (41.3%) whose tumors were positive for p53 fared somewhat better than patients with negative tumors, with no significant differences in either OS or DFS. Patients presenting with less than ten pathologically involved axillary lymph nodes showed significantly better OS and DFS.;Overexpression of HER-2/neu and the p53 protein were not significant prognostic factors in inflammatory breast cancer. However, the increased incidence of HER-2/neu and the poor outcome of IBC may be of clinical interest, suggesting the need for clinical trials of antibody therapy targeted to HER-2/neu.

Several molecular classifications of breast cancers based on expression profiling have been proposed as alternatives. However, their reliability and clinical utility have been repeatedly questioned, notably because most of them were derived from relatively small initial patient populations. We analyzed the transcriptomes of 537 breast tumors using three unsupervised classification methods. A core subset of 355 tumors was assigned to six clusters by all three methods. These six subgroups overlapped with previously defined molecular classes of breast cancer, but also showed important differences, notably the absence of an ERBB2 subgroup and the division of the large luminal ER+ group into four subgroups, two of them being highly proliferative. Of the six subgroups, four were ER+/PR+/AR+, one was ER-/PR-/AR+ and one was triple negative (AR-/ER-/PR-). ERBB2-amplified tumors were split between the ER-/PR-/AR+ subgroup and the highly proliferative ER+ LumC subgroup. Importantly, each of these six molecular subgroups showed specific copy-number alterations. Gene expression changes were correlated to specific signaling pathways. Each of these six subgroups showed very significant differences in tumor grade, metastatic sites, relapse-free survival or response to chemotherapy. All these findings were validated on large external datasets including more than 3000 tumors. Our data thus indicate that these six molecular subgroups represent well-defined clinico-biological entities of breast cancer.

For 44 tumor samples, western blotting analysis was conducted to examine the phosphorylation of HER2, external signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 and -2 and Akt, and the immunohistochemical phenotypes of the samples with respect to ER and HER2 were also assessed. Phosphorylation of HER2 was detected in 4 of 15 immunohistochemically HER2-positive tumor samples (26.7%). ERK1/2 was more highly phosphorylated in triple-negative breast cancers. Phosphorylation of Akt kinase was significantly higher in triple-negative breast cancers. Triple-negative breast cancers are characterized by increased phosphorylation of Akt kinase. In the present study, we found for the first time that there is a population with a significantly activated Akt pathway in this type of breast cancer.",

Previous studies involving European and United States patients have shown that breast tumors can be divided by their gene expression profiles into distinct \"molecular subtypes.\" In this report, we surveyed a series of invasive and preinvasive breast tumors from Asian-Chinese patients to investigate whether similar subtypes could also be observed in this ethnic group.;An analysis of expression profiles generated from 11 nonmalignant breast tissues, 17 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) and 98 invasive carcinomas identified three broad molecular subtypes of breast [estrogen receptor (ER)+, ERBB2+ and ER-] in the Asian-Chinese population. These subtypes were highly similar to the \"Luminal,\" \"ERBB2+,\" and \"Basal\" molecular subtypes defined in previous studies, and the subtype-specific expression signatures were also observed in preinvasive DCIS tumors. By comparing the expression profiles of nonmalignant DCIS and invasive breast cancers for two subtypes (ER+ and ERBB2+), we identified several genes that were regulated in both a common and subtype-specific manner during the normal/DCIS and DCIS/invasive carcinoma transitions. Several of these genes were validated by comparison with another recently published similar, but not identical, study.;Our results suggest that molecularly similar subtypes of breast cancer are indeed broadly conserved between Asian and Caucasian patients, and that these subtypes are already present at the preinvasive stage of carcinogenesis.

For example, altered signaling in the networks activated by the ErbB family of receptors, particularly in ERBB2-amplified cancers, contributes to drug resistance. We developed a multiscale systems model of signaling networks in ERBB2-amplified breast cancer to quantitatively investigate relationships between biomarkers (markers of network activity) and combination drug efficacy. This model linked ErbB receptor family signaling to breast tumor growth through two kinase cascades: the PI3K/AKT survival pathway and the Ras/MEK/ERK growth and proliferation pathway. The model predicted molecular mechanisms of resistance to individual therapeutics. In particular, ERBB2-amplified breast cancer cells stimulated with the ErbB3 ligand heregulin were resistant to growth arrest induced by inhibitors of AKT and MEK or coapplication of two inhibitors of the receptor ErbB2 [Herceptin (trastuzumab) and Tykerb (lapatinib)]. We used model simulations to predict the response of ErbB2-positive breast cancer xenografts to combination therapies and verified these predictions in mice. Treatment with trastuzumab, lapatinib, and the ErbB3 inhibitor MM-111 was more effective in inhibiting tumor growth than the combination of AKT and MEK inhibitors and even induced tumor regression, indicating that targeting both ErbB3 and ErbB2 may be an improved therapeutic approach for ErbB2-positive breast cancer patients.

Gene expression of ADAM12 spliced variants (12L and 12S) was evaluated using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR in samples obtained by laser capture microdissection from 38 patients with breast cancers and compared with adjacent healthy breast tissues. Both ADAM12L and 12S expression were significantly up-regulated in breast cancers, while in the normal breast, we found a very low expression. ADAM12L expression was significantly correlated with the histopathological types and, although not statistically significant, ADAM12 both variants were up-regulated in high-grade, highly-proliferative and HER2÷neu positive tumors.

However, copy number gains (CNG) of ALK were identified in 82 of 133 patients (62 %). The CEP2 analysis revealed polysomy of chromosome 2 in all HCNG and LCNG cases, indicating the CNG of ALK are due to polysomy of chromosome 2, rather than true amplification of ALK. To conclude, we observed CNG of ALK secondary to chromosome 2 polysomy in a significant percentage of breast cancer cases, a phenomenon similar to polysomy 17.

The correlation of the gene expression profiles with patients' clinicopathological features and clinical outcomes were analyzed for statistical significance.;MMP-13 protein was detected in the cytoplasm of the malignant cells and the peritumoral stromal cells. MMP-13 expression by tumor cells (p < 0.001) and stromal fibroblasts (p <0.001) both correlated with carcinoma infiltration of lymph nodes. MMP-13 also correlated with the expression of Her-2/neu (p = 0.015) and TIMP-1 (p < 0.010), respectively in tumor cells. Tumor-derived, but not stromal fibroblast-derived, MMP-13 correlated with aggressive tumor phenotypes. Moreover, high levels of MMP-13 expression were associated with decreased overall survival.

Present studies demonstrate that exposure to a novel hydroxamic acid analogue histone deacetylase inhibitor, LAQ824, induced p21WAF1 and p27KIP1 and caused growth arrest and apoptosis of human breast cancer SKBR-3 and BT-474 cells that possess amplification and overexpression of Her-2/neu. Treatment with LAQ824 depleted the mRNA and protein levels of Her-2/neu-encoded Her-2, which was associated with attenuation of pAKT, c-Raf-1, and phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase levels. LAQ824 also induced the acetylation of heat shock protein (hsp) 90, resulting in inhibition of its binding to ATP, which has been shown to impair the chaperone association of hsp 90 with its client proteins, Her-2, AKT, and c-Raf-1. Consistent with this, treatment with LAQ824 shifted the binding of Her-2 from hsp 90 to hsp 70, promoting proteasomal degradation of Her-2. Thus, LAQ824 depletes Her-2 through two mechanisms: attenuation of its mRNA levels and promotion of its degradation by the proteasome. Following LAQ824 treatment, the cell membrane association, autotyrosine phosphorylation, and colocalization of Her-2 with HER-3 also declined. Cotreatment with LAQ824 significantly increased trastuzumab-induced apoptosis of BT-474 and SKBR-3 cells. This was associated with greater attenuation of Her-2, c-Raf-1, and pAKT levels. LAQ824 also enhanced taxotere-induced, epothilone B-induced, and gemcitabine-induced apoptosis of BT-474 and SKBR-3 cells. These findings suggest that LAQ824 is active against human breast cancer cells and has the potential to improve the efficacy of trastuzumab, taxotere, gemcitabine, and epothilone B against breast cancer with Her-2/neuamplification.",

Osteopontin-c is selectively expressed in invasive, but not in noninvasive, breast tumor cell lines, and it effectively supports anchorage independence. We evaluated osteopontin-c as a biomarker. The RNA message for osteopontin-c was present in 16 of 20 breast cancers (80%), but was undetectable in 22 normal specimens obtained from reduction mammoplasty. In contrast, osteopontin-a RNA was expressed at various levels in all 20 breast cancers, 11 tumor-surrounding tissues and 21 normal samples. The splice variant osteopontin-b was present at barely detectable levels in 18 of 20 cancers and in 6 of 22 normal breasts. By immunohistochemistry, 66 of 69 normal breasts were negative, while 3 showed low level staining. Among the breast cancers, 43 of 56 cores (77%) stained positive for osteopontin-c. When correlated with tumor grade, the staining for osteopontin-c increased from grade 1 to grade 3. In a total of 178 breast specimens analyzed, osteopontin-c was present in 78% of cancers, 36% of surrounding tissues and 0% of normal tissues. Furthermore, osteopontin-c detects a higher fraction of breast cancers than estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor or HER2. In conjunction, osteopontin-c, ER and HER2 reliably predict grade 2-3 breast cancer.

Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) have been known to contribute to breast cancer progression. It is unclear whether Ano1 is associated with clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients with different ER, PR and HER2 status. In the present study, we investigated the Ano1 expression in 431 patients with invasive ductal breast carcinoma and 46 patients with fibroadenoma, using immunohistochemistry, and analyzed the association between Ano1 expression and clinical characteristics and outcomes of breast cancer patients with different ER, PR, and HER2 status. Ano1 was overexpressed in breast cancer compared with fibroadenoma. Ano1 was significantly more associated with breast cancer with the lower clinical stage (stage I or II), or triple-negative status. Mostly importantly, Ano1 overexpression was associated with good prognosis in patients with the PR-positive or HER2-negative status, and in patients following tamoxifen treatment. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that Ano1 overexpression was a prognostic factor for longer overall survival in PR-positive or HER2-negative patients, and a predictive factor for longer overall survival in patients following tamoxifen treatment. Our findings suggest that Ano1 may be a potential marker for good prognosis in PR-positive or HER2-negative patients following tamoxifen treatment.

Sections obtained from tissue arrays and whole sections from 10 non-neoplastic breast tissues were stained for ER, PR, ErbB2, and RFP using immunohistochemistry, and ErbB2 gene status was evaluated by FISH. The correlation between various immunohistochemical markers was determined. We found nuclear RFP expression in 41.4% of invasive carcinomas and in none of the non-neoplastic breast tissues. We also stained whole sections of 29 cases of invasive breast carcinoma, which included the TMA study, and 10 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) by RFP. We observed that four (40%) of the DCIS cases were positive with RFP. In statistical analysis, there was a significant, positive association between RFP and ErbB2 status at the protein level (p=0.002) and the gene level (p=0.049). There was no statistically significant association between the expression of RFP and tumor size, LN status, ER, PR, and grade (p>0.05). However, we found a significant association between age and RFP expression. RFP expression was stronger in patients 50 years or older (p=0.048). In our study, the expression of RFP correlated strongly with ErbB2 status. Our study is the first in the literature to show expression of RFP in patients with breast carcinoma. However, the possible role of RFP in breast carcinogenesis needs to be investigated in more detailed clinical and experimental studies.",

Classically, human breast carcinoma has been classified for therapeutic purposes in two distinct categories: one hormone-correlated, the other hormone-uncorrelated. However, the recent advancements of the technology applied to molecular biology by genomic and proteomic analyses have suggested that many more factors are involved in breast cancer growth and progression and that some clusters of these distinguish subgroups of patients at different prognosis. The knowledge of the diversities between tumor and normal tissue of origin is the key to identify novel targets for new selective therapeutic strategies. In fact, the principal goal of molecular-targeted therapy is the suppression of the transformed phenotype minimally affecting normal cells. This review focuses on the molecular targeting compounds directed against the known molecular pathways involved in breast cancer such as: type I growth factors (HER-2/neu; epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]), angiogenesis, cyclooxigenase-2 (COX-2) and farnesylation. Presently, trastuzumab is the first agent approved for therapy of HER-2/neu overexpressing tumors. Several other compounds directed against different targets have entered clinical evaluation and the preliminary results are here presented and commented. The major challenges on the clinical development of targeted therapy include the proper selection of patients, the identification of the optimal dosage and schedule of administration, the combinations with conventional treatments and the more appropriate therapeutic strategy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a humanized antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the tyrosine kinase orphan receptor Her-2/neu (erbB-2) that has shown therapeutic efficacy against Her-2/neu-overexpressing breast tumors. However, less than 35% of patients with Her-2/neu-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer respond to trastuzumab as a single agent, whereas the remaining cases do not demonstrate tumor regression. Furthermore, the majority of patients who achieve an initial response generally acquire resistance within one year. Therefore, the identification of the potential mechanisms of resistance to trastuzumab can be very helpful for the development of new compounds, which might overcome that resistance and/or have additive/synergistic antitumor effect when given in association with trastuzumab. Recent studies in breast cancer cells have revealed a bi-directional connection between Her-2/neu and fatty acid synthase (FAS), a major lipogenic enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of long-chain saturated fatty acids from the 2-carbon donors malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. Her-2/neu overexpression stimulates the FAS promoter and ultimately mediates increased endogenous fatty synthesis, and this Her-2/neu-mediated induction of breast cancer-associated FAS is inhibitable by trastuzumab. On the other hand, chemical FAS inhibitors as well as RNA interference-mediated silencing of FAS gene repress Her-2/neu gene expression at the transcriptional level. Moreover, specific FAS blockade synergistically sensitizes breast cancer cells carrying Her-2/neu-oncogene amplification and/or overexpression to trastuzumab-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death. Strikingly, FAS inhibition synergistically interacts with trastuzumab in Her-2/neu-negative breast cancer cells engineered to overexpress Her-2/neu, thus suggesting that the molecular linkage between FAS activity and functioning of Her-2/neu cannot be explained only on the basis of a transcriptional repression of Her-2/neu gene promoter. Interestingly, while in liver and adipose tissue FAS produces fat from excess carbon consumed as carbohydrates, which is ultimately stored as triglycerides, in epithelial cancer cells, FAS activity is mainly involved in the production of phospholipids partitioning into detergent-resistant membrane microdomains (lipid raft-aggregates), which point to an active role of FAS in the deregulation of membrane functioning in tumor cells. Importantly, clusters of Her-2/neu and EGFR (erbB-1) co-localize with lipid rafts and the lipid environment in the cell membrane of breast cancer cells profoundly influences their association properties and biological functions. We hypothesize that pharmacological or small interference RNA-induced inhibition of breast cancer-associated FAS will result in major changes in the synthesis of phospholipids which, in turn, should impair a correct cellular localization of Her-2/neu at the cellular membrane of breast cancer cells. In this working model, FAS inhibition could induce a shift in the equilibrium between transport of Her-2/neu to and from the membrane favoring an increased Her-2/neu internalization followed by intracellular degradation, thus enhancing the mechanism of action of the anti-Her-2/neu antibody trastuzumab. Moreover, the inhibition of FAS-driven lipid rafts will also negatively affect EGFR-Her-2/neu cross-talk, an important mechanism of trastuzumab resistance. In summary, the specific blockade of a novel molecular linkage between FAS-regulated membrane composition and functioning of transmembrane growth factor receptors EGFR and Her-2/neu may represent a previously unrecognized therapeutic approach circumventing trastuzumab resistance in breast carcinomas.",

Between 15 to 25% of breast cancers are characterized by overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2).

Humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab was the first targeted therapy against HER-2 used in clinical practice. Trastuzumab has significantly improved the prognosis of HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer, is effective as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy, has proven efficacy in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and also in adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting. Despite trastuzumab success in treatment, several important questions are still not clearly answered. The most discussed issues are the optimal selection of patients with regard to HER-2 testing, combination of trastuzumab with anthracyclines, comparison of the efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with different chemotherapy regimens, the ideal scheduling of trastuzumab administration, the duration of treatment, especially in adjuvant therapy, continuation of trastuzumab treatment beyond disease progression and after development of brain metastasis. Trastuzumab is generally well tolerated and the clinically most important adverse effect is potential for congestive heart failure, therefore careful cardiac monitoring is required for all patients receiving this therapy.

The main aim of the present study was to classify breast cancer into molecular subtypes based on immunohistochemistry findings and correlate the subtypes with clinicopathological factors. Two hundred and seventeen primary breast carcinomas tumor tissues were immunostained for ER, PR, HER2, CK5/6, EGFR, CK8/18, p53 and Ki67 using tissue microarray technique. All subtypes were significantly associated with Malay ethnic background (p=0.035) compared to other racial origins. The most common subtypes of breast cancers were luminal A and was significantly associated with low histological grade (p<0.000) and p53 negativity (p=0.003) compared to HER2+/ER-, basal-like and normal-like subtypes with high histological grade (p<0.000) and p53 positivity (p=0.003). Luminal B subtype had the smallest mean tumor size (p=0.009) and also the highest mean number of lymph nodes positive (p=0.032) compared to other subtypes. All markers except EGFR and Ki67 were significantly associated with the subtypes. The most common histological type was infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NOS. Majority of basal-like subtype showed comedo-type necrosis (68.8%) and infiltrative margin (81.3%). Our studies suggest that IHC can be used to identify the different subtypes of breast cancer and all subtypes were significantly associated with race, mean tumor size, mean number of lymph node positive, histological grade and all immunohistochemical markers except EGFR and Ki67.",

Development of new therapeutic agents for inhibiting breast cancer metastasis is therefore an urgent need. We previously demonstrated that recombinant DNA-derived viral capsid protein VP1 (rVP1) of foot-and-mouth disease virus-induced apoptosis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro. Here, we investigated whether rVP1 exhibits any inhibitory effects on migration/metastasis and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), a well-known biomarker for poor prognosis of breast cancer. The effects of rVP1 on cancer cell migration/invasion and metastasis were evaluated using Transwell migration assay and animal cancer models of metastasis. Western blotting, RT-PCR, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining techniques were used to investigate the effects of rVP1 on HER-2 and signal transduction mediators. Non-cytotoxic concentrations of rVP1-induced mesenchymal-epithelial transition and significantly suppressed AP-2α and HER-2 expression as well as the migration and invasion of a variety of breast cancer cell lines in a β1-integrin-dependent manner in vitro. Gross and histopathologic examinations showed that rVP1 also suppressed metastasis of several breast cancer cell lines, including HER-2-overexpressing SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells to lung, liver, or peripheral lymph node in orthotopic allograft/xenograft murine models. In addition, rVP1 significantly prolonged survival in breast cancer-bearing mice. Notably, no apparent side effects of rVP1 were detected, as shown by normal complete blood count levels and serum biochemistry profiles, including AST, ALT, BUN, and creatine. This study demonstrates that rVP1 suppresses the migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer cells via binding to β1 integrin receptor and down-regulation of AP-2α and HER-2 expression. The effectiveness of rVP1 on inhibiting migration/metastasis of breast cancer and HER-2 expression suggests that it may be suitable for serving as potential therapeutics for metastatic breast cancer particularly HER-2-overexpressing cancer.",

This subgroup accounts for 15% of all types of breast cancer. Histologically, triple-negative breast cancers are poorly differentiated and are characterized by an aggressive clinical history. A significant overlap exists in biological and clinical characteristics of basal-like breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. Treatment options are limited, as these tumors lack a therapeutic target and are naturally resistant to existing targeted therapies, i.e., endocrine treatment and trastuzumab. As there are no specific treatment guidelines for this subgroup, triple-negative breast cancers are managed with standard treatment; however, local and systemic relapse rates are high due to the adverse biology of the disease. Triple-negative breast cancer has many histological and genetic similarities with BRCA-1-associated breast cancer, suggesting a common pathogenesis and the potential use of common chemotherapeutics in both cancers. This review discusses current and future treatment options in the light of the new insights in major proliferative pathways active in the pathogenesis of triple-negative breast cancer.",

We performed tissue microarray (TMA) analysis of 425 breast cancer tissues collected during operation. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to measure expression of YKL-40 and several breast cancer biomarkers, such as aldehyde dehyadrogenase1, TGF-beta, and Gli-1 as well as hormonal receptor and Her-2/neu status. Statistical analysis of the relationship of YKL-40 expression with clinicopathological characteristics was performed for 390 TMA samples. YKL-40 was expressed to varying degrees in 84.9% of breast cancer tissues. YKL-40 expression was correlated with estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negativity and was positively correlated with TGF-beta and Gli-1 expression. Strong YKL-40 expression was associated with a larger proportion of Her-2/neu-enriched and basal-like tumors.

Determination of HER-2 tumor status offers clinically useful information, as it selects patients who may benefit from treatment with trastuzumab, the monoclonal antibody against HER-2. Currently approved methods for HER-2 testing include immunohistochemistry or fluorescent in situ hybridization using tumor tissue. A fragment of HER-2 composed of its extracellular domain (ECD) can also be detected in the serum of some patients with breast cancer. As an easily accessible tumor marker, it could offer additional useful prognostic or predictive information. This review will briefly address the biology of the circulating HER-2 ECD and discuss the evidence to support the role, if any, for measuring HER-2 ECD levels in women with breast cancer. In particular, we focus on the value and limitations of serum ECD in both early and advanced breast cancer in the following clinical contexts: as a marker of HER-2 tumor tissue status; clinical implications of raised levels in women who have a tumor not overexpressing HER-2; as a prognostic indicator and as a predictor of response to treatment; and as a monitoring tool for early recurrence. On the basis of our review of the literature, we conclude that there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of serum HER-2 ECD in the routine management of individual patients with breast cancer.

The role of this receptor in the progression of HER2+ breast cancer and resistance to certain anticancer monotherapies was investigated. The results of several pre-clinical and clinical trials, with the aim of determining the most safe and effective course of treatment for HER2+ breast cancer, were also thoroughly examined.;A thorough search of databases including Pubmed, Springer, and The American Society of Clinical Oncology was performed, and pertinent studies were identified. The most relevant studies were preclinical, phase II, and III clinical trials identifying the function of the HER2 receptor in HER2+ breast cancer progression, as well as studies assessing the efficacy of monotherapy and combination therapy in the treatment of this aggressive form of cancer.;The HER2 receptor belongs to a family of receptors that consists of four cell-surface receptors (HER1-4) that share strong homology with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). All HER receptors interact with specific types of ligands to induce receptor activation, except for HER2, for which no known ligand has yet been identified. HER2 is activated by forming dimers with other HER receptors, and this results in a stronger and more prolonged signal transduction event. When expressed at normal levels, HER2 regulates cell growth, differentiation, and survival. However, under pathological conditions of HER2 overexpression, numerous HER2 heterodimers are formed resulting in aggressive tumor growth. Therefore, the prognosis associated with HER2-positive breast cancer is usually poor. A specific cohort of patients with breast cancer whose tumors test both hormone receptor (estrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone receptor [PR]) and HER2 positive have been found to be resistant to targeted hormone therapy. Studies investigating the etiology of this resistance have found that the cell membrane estrogen receptor communicates with HER2 in promoting the release of ER coactivators that cause the endocrine drug and selective estrogen receptor modulator, tamoxifen, to act as an agonist rather than an antagonist of the hormone estrogen. Thus, research has directed its inquiry toward the development of therapies specifically targeting HER2. The development of trastuzumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against HER2, initially proved to be a well-tolerated first line of treatment. However, in the long-term patients, trastuzumab was shown to develop resistance to this monotherapy. Therefore, research on HER2 positive breast cancer has focused on the study of different anti-HER2 combination therapies over the past decade.;While the development and approval of the HER2-targeted recombinant monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) has been efficacious in slowing HER2 cancer progression, combining this and other anti-HER2 therapy with either chemotherapy or endocrine therapy has proven more effective in improving overall and progression free survival.",

Case patients who had HER-2/neu gene amplification in their malignant tumor were more likely to have had HER-2/neu amplification in their prior benign biopsy (P =.06, Fisher's exact test).;Women with benign breast biopsies demonstrating both HER-2/neu amplification and a proliferative histopathologic diagnosis may be at substantially increased risk for subsequent breast cancer.",

ECD/HER-2 was significantly associated with tumor burden, progesterone receptor levels, and presence of visceral metastases. Patients with elevated pretreatment levels had a significantly shorter OS but not time-to-progression than did those with ECD/HER-2 levels <10.5 ng/ml in univariate analysis. In univariate but not multivariate subset analyses, among patients treated with endocrine therapy (megestrol acetate), elevated initial ECD/HER-2 was associated with worse OS compared with nonelevated patients. However, among patients treated with chemotherapy (mainly anthracycline-containing regimens), OS did not differ significantly. Rates of response to either endocrine therapy or chemotherapy were similar for patients with elevated and nonelevated ECD/HER-2 levels.;ECD/HER-2 levels are elevated in 35-40% of patients with metastatic breast cancer.

We established an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with high sensitivity and quantified serum HER2-AAbs in 100 healthy women, 100 untreated patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and 500 untreated patients with invasive breast carcinoma (IBC). The associations between the levels of HER2-AAbs and breast cancer risk, and recurrence-free survival, were examined. High levels of HER2-AAbs were significantly associated with a reduced risk of DCIS (odds ratio [OR] 0.19, P = 4.6 × 10(-7)) or IBC (OR 0.31, P = 3.7 × 10(-7)).

Investigating effects of AMPK activation on breast cancer cell signaling and survival, we found that breast cancer cell lines with amplification and over-expression of HER2 or EGFR are 2- to 5-fold more sensitive to cytotoxic effects of AICAR, a canonical pharmacological activator of AMPK, than breast cancer cell lines lacking HER2 or EGFR overexpression. Paralleling effects on cell survival, AICAR leads to dose- and time-dependent inhibition of HER2 and EGFR in HER2-amplified breast cancer cells, with activation of AMPK and suppression of HER2/ EGFR activity preceding commitment to cell death. Transfection of constitutively active AMPKα also leads to decreased HER2 and EGFR phosphorylation, reduced downstream signaling associated with these receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and reduced breast cancer cell growth, confirming effects of AMPK activity on HER2/ EGFR. Ensuing co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated an interaction of HER2 with AMPK and an in vitro phosphorylation assay found that HER2 and EGFR contain sequences that are potential substrates for AMPK.

To understand the role of miRNAs in this molecular complexity, we performed miRNA expression analysis in a cohort of molecularly well-characterized human breast cancer cell lines to identify miRNAs associated with the most common molecular subtypes and the most frequent genetic aberrations.;Using a microarray carrying LNA™ modified oligonucleotide capture probes), expression levels of 725 human miRNAs were measured in 51 breast cancer cell lines. Differential miRNA expression was explored by unsupervised cluster analysis and was then associated with the molecular subtypes and genetic aberrations commonly present in breast cancer.;Unsupervised cluster analysis using the most variably expressed miRNAs divided the 51 breast cancer cell lines into a major and a minor cluster predominantly mirroring the luminal and basal intrinsic subdivision of breast cancer cell lines. One hundred and thirteen miRNAs were differentially expressed between these two main clusters. Forty miRNAs were differentially expressed between basal-like and normal-like/claudin-low cell lines. Within the luminal-group, 39 miRNAs were associated with ERBB2 overexpression and 24 with E-cadherin gene mutations, which are frequent in this subtype of breast cancer cell lines. In contrast, 31 miRNAs were associated with E-cadherin promoter hypermethylation, which, contrary to E-cadherin mutation, is exclusively observed in breast cancer cell lines that are not of luminal origin. Thirty miRNAs were associated with p16INK4 status while only a few miRNAs were associated with BRCA1, PIK3CA/PTEN and TP53 mutation status. Twelve miRNAs were associated with DNA copy number variation of the respective locus.;Luminal-basal and epithelial-mesenchymal associated miRNAs determine the subdivision of miRNA transcriptome of breast cancer cell lines. Specific sets of miRNAs were associated with ERBB2 overexpression, p16INK4a or E-cadherin mutation or E-cadherin methylation status, which implies that these miRNAs may contribute to the driver role of these genetic aberrations. Additionally, miRNAs, which are located in a genomic region showing recurrent genetic aberrations, may themselves play a driver role in breast carcinogenesis or contribute to a driver gene in their vicinity. In short, our study provides detailed molecular miRNA portraits of breast cancer cell lines, which can be exploited for functional studies of clinically important miRNAs.",

There has been a sharp increase in the detection of breast carcinoma, although mortality is still unvaried. In the last ten years the incidence of breast cancer measuring less than 1 cm, corresponding to pT1a, pT1b in TNM stadiation, has greatly increased. The present study describes the biologic characterisation of small breast carcinomas. The Nottingham/Tenovus Primary Breast Cancer Study stated that tumour size is a significant, independent factor for breast cancer prognosis. Cases were selected among formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 360 ductal breast cancers. In one-half of cases, the tumour was less than 1 cm in diameter, pT1a- pT1b; in the other half the tumour size was greater than 1 cm, but less than 2 cm, pT1c. Histological grading was assessed with the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson method, without Nottingham grade. Immunohistochemical determinations for ER, PgR, Ki-67, Her-2/Neu, CD34, p53, EGFR were done with an automated method. From the above analyses, it was demonstrated that the tumour size is indeed an important prognostic factor, particularly in cases without lymph node metastasis (N0). In particular, we observed significant differences between pT1a-b and pT1c cases, confirming that tumour size is an important criterion for prognostic valuation in ductal breast cancer without lymph node metastasis.",

Breast cancer is also one of the most investigated diseases but whose biological features are still not well understood, several effective treating strategies having been explored in dealing with different types of advanced breast cancer, such as endocrine therapy and molecular targeted therapy. Trastuzumab is the first approved targeted anti-cancer agent to show an attractive response rate and outcomes in treating HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients. However, primary or acquired trastuzumab resistance usually occurs some time into the use of trastuzumab and leads to treatment resistance or tumour progression. The promising results with trastuzumab targeted therapy encouraged further investigations in this area exploring several novel targeted agents aiming to overcome the resistance drawback of trastuzumab. In this review we discuss the major newly developed targeted agents in breast cancer treatment, including the novel anti-HER-2 monoclonal antibody pertuzumab or ertumaxomab, small molecular tyrosine inhibitor lapatinib, selective PARP1 inhibitor olaparib, mTOR inhibitor rapamycin analogues, and sheddase inhibitors.

We tested if HER2 and the leptin receptor (ObR) can be coexpressed in breast cancer cell models, whether these two receptors can physically interact, and whether leptin can transactivate HER2. Next, we studied if leptin/ObR can coexist with HER2 in breast cancer tissues, and if presence of these two systems correlates with specific clinicopathological features.;Expression of ObR, HER2, phospho-HER2 was assessed by immunoblotting. Physical interactions between ObR and HER2 were probed by immunoprecipitation and fluorescent immunostaining. Expression of leptin and ObR in breast cancer tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Associations among markers studied by IHC were evaluated using Fisher's exact test for count data.;HER2 and ObR were coexpressed in all studied breast cancer cell lines. In MCF-7 cells, HER2 physically interacted with ObR and leptin treatment increased HER2 phosphorylation on Tyr 1248. In 59 breast cancers, the presence of leptin was correlated with ObR (the overall association was about 93%). This result was confirmed both in HER2-positive and in HER2-negative subgroups. The expression of leptin or ObR was numerically more frequent in larger (> 10 mm) tumors.;Coexpression of HER2 and the leptin/ObR system might contribute to enhanced HER2 activity and reduced sensitivity to anti-HER2 treatments.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical significance of GRB7 protein expression in human breast cancer. Western blotting analysis of protein extracts from 563 annotated frozen breast tumors was performed. Expression status of GRB7 and HER-2 was correlated with clinical covariates and outcomes. Cox proportional hazards were used to identify factors associated with breast cancer-free interval. The median follow-up was 71 months. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant (two-sided). A discrepancy between HER-2 and GRB7 protein over-expression was observed. GRB7 protein over-expression was associated with negative estrogen and progesterone receptor status, higher tumor grade, larger primary tumor size, (more) axillary lymph node involvement, higher clinical stage, and shortened breast cancer-free interval. HER-2 protein over-expression was associated only with higher tumor grade. Multi-variate analysis revealed that GRB7 protein over-expression was an independent adverse prognostic factor for breast cancer-free interval (hazard ratio 1.69, 95% confidence interval 1.07-2.67; P = 0.024). The same was true of the subset of patients who did not receive any adjuvant systemic therapy (hazard ratio 1.68, 95% confidence interval 1.16-2.31; P = 0.0055). Using FISH analysis, 32/32 (100%; 95% CI 89-100%) tumors which over-expressed both HER-2 and GRB7 proteins and 1/35 (3%; 95% CI 0-15%) tumors with HER-2 but no GRB7 protein over-expression with Western blotting analysis demonstrated HER-2 gene amplification. GRB7 protein over-expression is an independent adverse prognostic factor in human breast cancer.",

Today, even though major breast cancer subtypes have been characterized, i.e., luminal A, luminal B, HER2+, and basal-like, little is known about the heterogeneity of breast cancer in blood, which could help to discover minimally invasive protein biomarkers with which clinical researchers can detect, classify, and monitor different breast cancer subtypes.;In this study, we performed an integrative pathway-assisted clustering analysis of breast cancer subtypes from plasma proteome samples collected from 80 patients diagnosed with breast cancer and 80 healthy women. First, four breast cancer subtypes and additionally unknown subtype (according to existing annotation) were determined based on pathology lab test results in primary tumors of enrolled patients. Next, we developed and applied four distance metrics, i.e., Protein Intensity, Q-Value, Pathway Profile, and Distance Score Function, to measure and characterize these cancer subtypes. Then, we developed a permutation test to evaluate the significant protein level changes in each biological pathway for each breast cancer subtype, using q-value. Lastly, we developed a pathway-protein matrix for each of the four distance methods to estimate the distance between breast cancer subtypes, for which further Pathway Association Network analysis were performed.;We found that 1) the luminal group (luminal A and luminal B) are clustered together, as well as the basal group (basal-like and HER2+) and 2) luminal A and luminal B are more close to each other than basal-like and HER2+ to each other. Our results were consistent with a recent independent breast cancer research from the Cancer Genome Atlas Network using genomic DNA copy number arrays, DNA methylation, exome sequencing, messenger RNA arrays, microRNA sequencing and reverse-phase protein arrays. Our results showed that changes of different breast cancer subtypes at the pathway level are more profound and less variable than those at the molecular level. Similar subtypes share distinct yet similar pathway activation networks, while dissimilar subtypes are different also at the level of pathway activation networks. The results also showed that distance or similarity of cancer subtypes based on pathway analysis might be able to provide further insight into the intrinsic relationship of breast cancer subtypes. We believe integrative pathway-assisted proteomics analysis described here can become a model for reliable clustering or classification of other cancer subtypes.",

The aim of the present study is to study the stromal expression of CD10 in breast carcinoma, find its relationship with other prognostic markers and study the role stroma plays in breast cancer pathogenesis.;A total of 70 cases of breast cancer were included in the study. Representative sections were taken and hematoxylin and eosin staining was done. Immunohistochemistry was performed with ER, PR, Her2neu and CD10. Stromal expression of CD10 (>10% stromal positivity was considered positive) in invasive breast carcinoma was noted and was statistically analyzed with different known prognostic markers of breast carcinoma.;Stromal expression of CD10 was found to be significantly associated with increasing tumor grade (P = 0.04), increasing mitotic rate (P = 0.33), worsening prognosis (P = 0.01), ER negativity (P = 0.0001), Her2neu positivity (P = 0.19) and with molecular subtypes (CD10 positivity with the HER2 type, and CD10 negativity with Luminal type). No correlation was found between CD10 overexpression and PR, age, menopausal status, tumor size, lymph node positivity and tumor stage.;This study gives substantial proof to the various models/research papers explaining the role of stroma/CD10 in breast cancer pathogenesis.

HER2 is a member of the EGF receptor family, which participates in cell growth and proliferation. HER2 may be overexpressed in 15 to 30% of breast cancer cases and is associated with poor prognosis, shortened overall survival and shorter time to disease progression. Furthermore, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated the relevance of HER2 serum concentrations (sHER2, extracellular domain released into the blood by proteolysis) as a predictive marker of resistance to chemotherapy in HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. The determination of HER2 overexpression/ amplification in the diagnosis of relapse of breast cancer is currently a routine procedure. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques, used to detect HER2 expression in the tumor, are improving constantly and other parallel techniques such as chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) are emerging. sHER2 concentrations can be measured using ELISA techniques, which can be automated. All of these procedures still need to be standardized. The discovery of a monoclonal antibody (4D5) that can inhibit the growth and proliferation of cells overexpressing HER2 led to the development of trastuzumab. Like 4D5, trastuzumab recognizes an epitope on the extracellular domain of HER2. Moreover, trastuzumab is also able to stimulate antibody-dependent cellular toxicity (ADCC). It is administered alone or in combination (with navelbine, taxol, carboplatin, etc.) in patients with metastatic breast cancer overexpressing HER2. Other active antibodies have since been discovered, as well as other specific molecules, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors which will undoubtedly find a place in the therapeutic arsenal used in breast cancer, especially to avoid resistance to treatment.",

A total of 510 women diagnosed with operable invasive breast cancer between 1997 and 2010 participated in the study. Data on demographics, breast cancer risk factors, and clinico-pathological characteristics were collected. The different breast cancer tumor subtypes were compared on their clinico-pathological characteristics and risk factor profiles, particularly reproductive variables and breastfeeding. Among the 501 breast cancer patients (with known ER and PR receptors), 85% were ER+/PR+ and 15% were ER-&PR-. Among the 405 breast cancer with known ER, PR and HER2 status, 71% were ER+/PR+/HER2- (luminal A), 14% were ER+/PR+/HER2+ (luminal B), 10% were ER-/PR-/HER2- (triple negative breast cancer, TNBC), and 5% were ER-/PR-/HER2+ (non-luminal). A lifetime breastfeeding period equal to or longer than 7 months was less frequent in case patients with TNBC (OR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.08-0.68) compared to luminal A breast cancers. Both a low (2 or fewer pregnancies) and a high (3-4 pregnancies) number of pregnancies combined with a long breastfeeding period were associated with reduced odds of TNBC compared with luminal A breast cancer, although the association seemed to be slightly more pronounced among women with a low number of pregnancies (OR = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.005-0.54).;In case-case analyses with the luminal A cases as the reference group, we observed a lower proportion of TNBC among women who breastfed 7 or more months. The combination of longer breastfeeding duration and lower parity seemed to further reduce the odds of having a TNBC compared to a luminal A breast cancer.",

Muc4 can also potentiate signal transduction by modulating differential ErbB2 phosphorylation in the absence and in the presence of the ErbB3 soluble ligand heregulin (HRG-beta1). These features of Muc4 suggest that Muc4 is not merely a cancer marker, but an oncogenic factor with a unique-binding/activation relationship with the receptor ErbB2. In the present study, we examined the signaling mechanisms that are associated with the Muc4-ErbB2 module by analyzing ErbB2 differential signaling in response to Muc4 expression. Our study was carried out in the A375 human melanoma and BT-474 breast cancer cell lines as our model systems. Quantitative and comparative signaling modulations were evaluated by immunoblot using phospho-specific antibodies, and densitometry analysis. Signaling complex components were identified by chemical cross-linking, fractionation by gel filtration, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting. Activated downstream signaling pathways were analyzed by an antibody microarray screen and immunoblot analyses. Our results indicate that Muc4 modulates ErbB2 signaling potential significantly by stabilizing and directly interacting with the ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimer. Further analyses indicate that Muc4 promotes ErbB2 autocatalysis, but it has no effect on ErbB3 phosphorylation, although the chemical cross-linking data indicated that the signaling module is composed of Muc4, ErbB2, and ErbB3. Our microarray analysis indicates that Muc4 expression promotes cell migration by increasing the phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase and also through an increase in the levels of beta-catenin.",

Then, we examined YAP and pYAP expression status using immunohistochemical analysis according to the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. We found that HER-2 type breast cancer demonstrated elevated expression level in tumoral cytoplasmic YAP (P = 0.011) and pYAP (P = 0.049). Expressions of stromal YAP (P = 0.002) and pYAP (P < 0.001) were higher in luminal B and HER-2 type breast cancer but lower in TNBC. In univariate analysis, nuclear YAP expression of tumor cells was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) (P = 0.024). Cytoplasmic YAP expression of HER-2 type breast cancer cells negatively affected disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.034). In conclusion, we concluded that there was a significant difference in YAP and pYAP expression status according to molecular subtypes and tumoral and cellular components of breast cancers.

The e23sFv-9R binding siRNA is able to specifically deliver the siRNA to HER2(+) breast cancer cells and concentrate and persist in orthotopic HER2(+) breast cancer xenografts for at least 36 h. CXCR4si delivered by e23sFv-9R inhibited CXCR4 gene expression, reduced proliferation and metastasis and induced apoptosis in the HER2(+) breast cancer BT-474 cell line in vitro. Moreover, the systemic delivery of CXCR4si by e23sFv-9R is able to suppress tumor growth, reduce metastasis and prolong survival in mice bearing HER2(+) xenografts. This approach causes no systemic toxicity and does not activate the innate immune response, suggesting that a fusion protein carrying CXCR4si shows promise in the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.",

We also found that ART3 protein is significantly overexpressed in human TNBC tumors tissue and cell lines through using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Overexpression of ART3 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells increased cell proliferation, invasion, and survival in vitro and growth of xenograft tumors.

This receptor possesses intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and has been associated with aggressive biological behavior and poor clinical outcome. METHODS: Data have been reviewed regarding the role of HER-2 expression as a prognostic variable, as a predictive factor for response to chemotherapy and hormonal therapies, and as a directed therapeutic target for breast cancer. RESULTS: Therapy with a humanized monoclonal antibody to HER-2 (trastuzumab) can be effective treatment in some patients with metastatic breast cancer, either given alone or in combination with some chemotherapeutic agents. Cardiac toxicity limits concurrent use with anthracyclines. Clinical trials will further define optimal combination regimens with this agent, and its value in patients with localized or locally advanced stages. CONCLUSIONS: Trastuzumab is a significant addition to the armamentarium against breast cancer. Standardization of the optimal method to evaluate for HER-2 overexpression is necessary to better define its role as a prognostic, predictor, and therapeutic target in this disease.",

Additionally, this sensitivity of CSCs to iron reduction is obviously indicated in various breast cancer cell lines; HCC1954, MDA-MB-435 and Hs578T.

We constructed breast cancer cell lines differing in HER2 expression by transducing HER2 cDNA or short hairpin RNA against HER2. We then assessed the radiosensitivity and investigated the potential mechanism by using cell proliferation assay, cell adhesion assays, anoikis assays, colony formation assays, and western blotting analyses. We found that HER2 introduction in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (low HER2 expression) and MDA-MB-231 (HER2 is not expressed) promoted cell proliferation and invasion and enhanced cell adhesion and resistance to anoikis. Moreover, HER2 reduced radiosensitivity in these two cells compared with the corresponding control. The opposite results were observed when HER2 was silenced in breast cancer cell lines ZR-7530 and SK-BR-3 (both cells with high expression of HER2) using HER2 shRNA. In addition, animal experiment results showed HER2 could enhance the radioresistance of xenograft tumors. Further studies showed HER2 promoted the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (Fak) and thereby up-regulated the expression of proteins associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition such as Claudin-1, ZO-1, and ZEB-1. The inhibition of Fak activity using the Fak inhibitor (PF-562281) restored the radiosensitivity in HER2-overexpressing cells.

In addition to advances in screening, genetic testing, imaging, surgical and radiation techniques, innovations in medical therapy including widespread use of HER2-directed therapy in early and advanced breast cancer have revolutionized breast cancer care and changed the natural history of HER2-positive breast cancer. A substantial number of HER2-targeted agents are being developed including monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, and antibody drug conjugates. Trastuzumab is the prototype HER2-directed therapy that was introduced in the late 1990s for the management of metastatic breast cancer and later showed efficacy in early stage disease. Despite the practice changing impact of trastuzumab and improvement in outcomes of women with HER2-positive breast cancer resistance to trrastuzumab is a major clinical issue, occurring in both early stage and advanced disease, and new treatment strategies are clearly required. Combining HER2-targeted agents and dual HER2 blockade has been successful in early and advanced breast cancer. Furthermore, selected delivery of potent chemotherapeutic agent coupled with HER2 inhibition promises new treatment options. This review is focused on current HER2-directed treatments for women with HER2-positive breast cancer including monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, and antibody drug conjugates. ",

Recently, growth factor receptor HER2/neu (ERBB2) status has made it possible to provide another form of targeted therapy linked to the overexpression of this protein. Presently, pathologists determine the receptor status in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections using subjective, semiquantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays and quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization for HER2. We developed a single-tube multiplex TaqMan (mERPR+HER2) assay to quantitate mRNA levels of ER, PR, HER2, and two housekeeping genes for breast cancer formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. Using data from the discovery sample sets, we evaluated IHC-status-dependent cutoff-point and IHC-status-independent clustering methods for the classification of receptor status and then validated these results with independent sample sets. Compared with IHC-status, the accuracies of the mERPR+HER2 assay with the cutoff-point classification method were 0.98 (95% CI: 0.97-1.00), 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.95), and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95-0.99) for ER, PR, and HER2, respectively, for the validation sets. Furthermore, the areas under the receiver operating-characteristic curves were 0.997 (95% CI: 0.994-1.000), 0.967 (95% CI: 0.949-0.985), and 0.968 (95% CI: 0.915-1.000) for ER, PR, and HER2, respectively.

In this work we have studied the potential molecular mechanism by which the VRK1 protein can contribute to a poorer prognosis in this disease. For this aim it was first analyzed by immunohistochemistry the VRK1 protein level in normal breast and in one hundred and thirty six cases of human breast cancer. The effect of VRK1 to protect against DNA damage was determined by studying the effect of its knockdown on the formation of DNA repair foci assembled on 53BP1 in response to treatment with ionizing radiation or doxorubicin in two breast cancer cell lines. VRK1 protein was detected in normal breast and in breast carcinomas at high levels in ER and PR positive tumors. VRK1 protein level was significantly lower in ERBB2 positive cases. Next, to identify a mechanism that can link VRK1 to poorer prognosis, VRK1 was knocked-down in two breast cancer cell lines that were treated with ionizing radiation or doxorubicin, both inducing DNA damage. Loss of VRK1 resulted in reduced formation of DNA-damage repair foci complexes assembled on the 53BP1 scaffold protein, and this effect was independent of damaging agent or cell type. This observation is consistent with detection of high VRK1 protein levels in ER and PR positive breast cancers. We conclude that VRK1 can contribute to make these tumors more resistant to DNA damage-based therapies, such as ionizing radiation or doxorubicin, which is consistent with its association to a poor prognosis in ER positive breast cancer. VRK1 is potential target kinase for development of new specific inhibitors which can facilitate sensitization to other treatments in combination therapies; or alternatively be used as a new cancer drugs.

We compared TNBC with the group of non-triple negative breast cancer in the clinicopathologic features. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method.;Of the 477 patients, 12.6% (60/477) was TNBC patients in which 76.7% of age was younger than fifty years(46/60), 28.3% of T > 5 cm (17/60), 68.3% of lymph nodes metastasis (41/60), 31.7% of grade III (19/60) and 13.3% of family history of breast cancer (8/60), (P < 0. 05).

The serum values were measured in a prospective series of patients with breast cancer (n = 233), benign breast disease (n = 176) and healthy control subjects (n = 215). The cut-off levels (90% specificity) were determined for each test. Using these cut-off levels the diagnostic sensitivity of the CEA test was 0.23, for the AFP test it was 0.16, for the CA 15-3 test 0.27, for the TPS test 0.18 and for the Neu oncoprotein test 0.19 in detecting breast cancer. Correlation coefficients (Pearson's) were statistically significant between CEA and CA 15-3, and between CA 15-3 and Neu oncoprotein measurements in breast cancer patients. In patients with benign breast disease the serum levels of AFP, CA 15-3, CEA and TPS correlated with age, being somewhat higher in older patients. Similarly, in population controls higher age correlated with higher levels of AFP, CA 15-3, Neu and TPS. In breast cancer patients there was no correlation between the age at diagnosis and any of the measured markers. The only marker statistically significantly associated with the stage of breast cancer was CA 15-3. In conclusion, our results indicate that serum CEA, AFP, CA 15-3, TPS and Neu oncoprotein are only of limited value in the diagnosis of breast cancer.",

We conducted a population-based nested case-control study among women 20-74 years of age diagnosed with a first breast cancer between 1996 and 2008 in western Washington State to evaluate the association between their tumor's estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2-neu (HER2) expression, and risk of CBC. The study included 482 cases diagnosed with both a FBC and a CBC and 1,506 control women diagnosed only once with breast cancer identified through our local Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry. Compared to the women whose FBC was ER+/PR+, those with ER-/PR- first tumors had a 1.6-fold (95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.2-2.3) increased risk of developing a CBC.

We used several assays to analyze the induction of apoptosis in the breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3 via PMN-dependent Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In the presence of the HER-2/neu Ab 520C9 and PMN from healthy donors, apoptosis occurred as detected by annexin V binding and disappearance of euploid SK-BR-3 nuclei, which can be differentiated from PMN nuclei by their increased DNA contents. Apoptosis induction was observed with E:T cell ratios as low as 10:1. Laser scanning fluorescence microscopy of TUNEL tumor cells or staining for cleaved cytokeratin-18 further confirmed apoptosis of the SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells. Killing via 520C9 was dependent on the interaction with FcR on PMN, because 1) F(ab')(2) fragments of 520C9 mediated no cytotoxicity, 2) target cell death was influenced by a biallelic polymorphism of FcgammaRIIa on the effector cells, and 3) a bispecific Ab against HER-2/neu and the IgA receptor (FcalphaRI) expressed on effector cells significantly induced apoptosis.

We compared the DNA copy number and mutational profiles of primary breast cancers and paired metastases from 23 patients using whole-genome array-comparative genomic hybridization and next-generation sequencing of 365 \"cancer-associated\" genes. Primary tumors and metastases harbored copy number alterations (CNAs) and mutations common in breast cancer and showed concordant profiles. The global concordance regarding CNAs was shown by clustering and correlation matrix, which showed that each metastasis correlated more strongly with its paired tumor than with other samples. Genes with recurrent amplifications in breast cancer showed 100% (ERBB2, FGFR1), 96% (CCND1), and 88% (MYC) concordance for the amplified/non-amplified status. Among all samples, 499 mutations were identified, including 39 recurrent (AKT1, ERBB2, PIK3CA, TP53) and 460 non-recurrent variants. The tumors/metastases concordance of variants was 75%, higher for recurrent (92%) than for non-recurrent (73%) variants. Further mutational discordance came from very different variant allele frequencies for some variants. We showed that the chosen targeted therapy in two clinical trials of personalized medicine would be concordant in all but one patient (96%) when based on the molecular profiling of tumor and paired metastasis. Our results suggest that the genotyping of primary tumor may be acceptable to guide systemic treatment if the metastatic sample is not obtainable. However, given the rare but potentially relevant divergences for some actionable driver genes, the profiling of metastatic sample is recommended. ",

The specific alterations that govern this transition have not been elucidated. HER2/neu is frequently overexpressed in DCIS but is less common in IBC, thereby suggesting additional requirements for transformation. To identify genes capable of cooperating with HER2/neu to fully transform mammary epithelial cells, we used an insertional mutagenesis screen on cells isolated from wild-type neu expressing mice and identified the E3 ligase HACE1 as HER2 cooperative tumor suppressor gene. Loss of HACE1 expression is commonly seen in clinical breast cancer data sets. HACE1 downregulation in normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) results in the accumulation of the activated GTP-bound Rac1 partially transforming these cells. Overexpression of HER2 activates Rac1, which further accumulates upon HACE1 loss resulting in Rac1 hyperactivation. Although the knockdown of HACE1 or overexpression of HER2 alone in HMECs is not sufficient for tumorigenesis, HER2 overexpression combined with HACE1 downregulation fully transforms HMECs resulting in robust tumor formation. The pharmaceutical interference of Rac function abrogates the effects of HACE1 loss both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in marked reduction in tumor burden. Our work supports a critical role for HACE1 in breast cancer progression and identifies patients that may benefit from Rac-targeted therapies. ",

In the first, a layer of the antibody type mouse anti-HER2 (clone tab250) was immobilized on a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid modified with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide (EDC).

The rougher, less passivating coating with cysteamine determined from cyclic voltammetry and scanning electron microscopy led to biosensors that are more sensitive to detect the breast cancer ERBB2 (HER2) biomarker in impedance spectroscopy measurements.

Notably, activation of P-Rex1 in breast cancer cells requires the convergence of inputs from ErbB receptors and a Gβγ- and PI3Kγ-dependent pathway. Moreover, we identified the GPCR CXCR4 as a crucial mediator of P-Rex1/Rac1 activation in response to ErbB ligands. P-Rex1 is highly overexpressed in human breast cancers and their derived cell lines, particularly those with high ErbB2 and ER expression.

Quantifying the expression and PTMs of biomarkers such as ErbB2 by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry has several limitations, including minimal coverage and extensive assay development time. Therefore, we assessed the utility of two high resolution, full scan mass spectrometry approaches, MS1 Filtering and SWATH MS2, for targeted ErbB2 proteomics. Endogenous ErbB2 immunoprecipitated from SK-BR-3 cells was in-gel digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, Asp-N, or trypsin plus Asp-N in triplicate. Data-dependent acquisition with an AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5600 and MS1 Filtering data processing was used to assess peptide and PTM coverage as well as the reproducibility of enzyme digestion. Data-independent acquisition (SWATH) was also performed for MS2 quantitation. MS1 Filtering and SWATH MS2 allow quantitation of all detected analytes after acquisition, enabling the use of multiple proteases for quantitative assessment of target proteins. Combining high resolution proteomics with multiprotease digestion enabled quantitative mapping of ErbB2 with excellent reproducibility, improved amino acid sequence and PTM coverage, and decreased assay development time compared to typical SRM assays. These results demonstrate that high resolution quantitative proteomic approaches are an effective tool for targeted biomarker quantitation.",

HER2-positive breast cancer, featuring amplification of HER2/neu and negative expression of ER and PR, has the three following characteristics: rapid tumor growth, lower survival rate, and better response to adjuvant therapies. Clinically, it is notable for its role in a pathogenesis that is associated with increased disease recurrence and acts as a worse prognosis. At the same time, it represents a good target for anti-cancer immunotherapy despite the prevalence of drug resistance.

Promoter hypermethylation of several known or putative tumor suppressor genes occurs frequently during the pathogenesis of breast cancer. We proposed that immunohistopathologic subtypes of breast cancer are likely to contain distinct promoter methylation patterns. A panel of 10 gene promoters was assessed by quantitative multiplex methylation-specific PCR in 114 invasive ductal carcinomas from Korea representing the three major subtypes [57 luminal, 24 human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), and 33 basal-like] based on immunohistochemical findings of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2, cytokeratin 5/6 and epidermal growth factor receptor. The median methylation levels of HIN1, RASSF1A and TWIST, and the average methylation ratio were significantly lower in basal-like subtype compared to luminal or HER2 subtypes. In contrast, BRCA1 methylation level was significantly higher in basal-like subtype than in luminal subtype. The methylation status of a panel of four genes (APC1, CDH, BRCA1 and RAR-β) in luminal and HER2 subtypes were dissimilar, where HER2 tumors showed a significantly higher level of methylation compared to luminal tumors. These results suggest that gene methylation in breast cancer can potentially serve as epigenetic biomarkers and may contribute further to current breast cancer classification.",

Our data show that HDACI preferentially repress the transcription of highly expressed genes as well as high copy number genes in HER2+ breast cancer genomes. In contrast, genes that are activated by HDACI are moderately expressed. We analyzed gene copy number in combination with microarray and GRO-seq analysis of expression level, in normal and breast cancer cells to show that high copy number genes are more likely to be repressed by HDACI than non-amplified genes. The inhibition of transcription of amplified oncogenes, which promote survival and proliferation of cancer cells, might explain the cancer-specific lethality of HDACI, and may represent a general therapeutic strategy for cancer.",

We examined a panel of breast cancer cell lines, xenograft tumors, and breast cancer patient specimens for the protein expression of ATG4B, and found a positive association between HER2 and ATG4B protein expression. We showed that HER2-positive cells, but not HER2-negative breast cancer cells, require ATG4B to survive under stress. In HER2-positive cells, cytoprotective autophagy was dependent on ATG4B under both starvation and HER2 inhibition conditions. Combined knockdown of ATG4B and HER2 by siRNA resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability, and the combination of ATG4B knockdown with trastuzumab resulted in a greater reduction in cell viability compared to trastuzumab treatment alone, in both trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cells. Together these results demonstrate a novel association of ATG4B positive expression with HER2 positive breast cancers and indicate that this subtype is suitable for emerging ATG4B inhibition strategies.",

Breast cancers categorized as ER(-)/HER2(-) revealed a high cDNA level of FABP-7 as compared to other groups of breast cancer (p=0.004). An immunohistochemical study carried out on 88 cases showed that FABP-7 overexpression had a strong relationship with triple-negative cases (45.8%, p=0.001) and the basal-like subtype (37.5%, p=0.001).

In fact, HER-2+ patients appear to be resistant to the CMF regimen and comparatively more sensitive to anthracyclins such as Herceptin. HER-2 testing is currently performed utilizing two main methods: gene amplification is usually determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), whereas protein overexpression is determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The comparison between FISH and IHC assays demonstrates a considerably high degree of concordance (around 90%). When dealing with cases scored as 3+ (according to the FDA licensed scoring method), such a concordance approaches 100%.

Here, we analyzed the antitumor activities of a supercritical fluid rosemary extract (SFRE) in different breast cancer cells, and used a genomic approach to explore its effect on the modulation of ER-α and HER2 signaling pathways, the most important mitogen pathways related to breast cancer progression. We found that SFRE exerts antitumor activity against breast cancer cells from different tumor subtypes and the downregulation of ER-α and HER2 receptors by SFRE might be involved in its antitumor effect against estrogen-dependent (ER+) and HER2 overexpressing (HER2+) breast cancer subtypes. Moreover, SFRE significantly enhanced the effect of breast cancer chemotherapy (tamoxifen, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel).

A subset of breast cancer patients with high HER-2/neu levels eventually experience metastatic disease progression when treated with Herceptin as a single agent. Mechanistic details of development of this aggressive disease are not clear. Therefore, there is a dire need to better understand the mechanisms by which drug resistance develops and to design new combined treatments that benefit patients with aggressive breast cancer and have minimal toxicity. We hypothesized that 3, 3'-diindolylmethane (DIM), a non-toxic agent can be combined with Herceptin to treat breast cancers with high levels of HER-2/neu. Here, we evaluated the effects of Herceptin alone and in combination with DIM on cell viability, apoptosis and clonogenic assays in SKBR3 (HER-2/neu-expressing) and MDA-MB-468 (HER-2/neu negative) breast cancer cells. We found that DIM could enhance the effectiveness of Herceptin by significantly reducing cell viability, which was associated with apoptosis-induction and significant inhibition of colony formation, compared with single agent treatment. These results were consistent with the down-regulation of Akt and NF-kB p65. Mechanistic investigations revealed a significant upregulation of miR-200 and reduction of FoxM1 expression in DIM and Herceptin-treated breast cancer cells. We, therefore, transfected cells with pre-miR-200 or silenced FoxM1 in these cells for understanding the molecular mechanism involved. These results provide experimental evidence, for the first time, that DIM plus Herceptin therapy could be translated to the clinic as a therapeutic modality to improve treatment outcome of patients with breast cancer, particularly for the patients whose tumors express high levels of HER-2/neu.",

Molecular therapies for breast cancer have developed rapidly in the past few decades and future treatment strategies are being investigated. The selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator tamoxifen, which until now has served as a standard therapy, functions not only as an estrogen antagonist but also as an estrogen agonist in terms of bone maintenance. Aromatase inhibitors have performed well in international trials and have become a new standard therapy for estrogen-dependent breast cancer. The systematic study of estrogen activation pathways suggests that the enzymes steroid sulfatase and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, which both have pivotal roles in estrogen biosynthesis, are promising targets; the results of a phase I trial of steroid sulfatase inhibitors are encouraging. The activity of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) pathway correlates negatively with that of the ER. HER2 is overexpressed in 22% of all breast cancers. In the decade since HER2 began being targeted, the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab has been used as well as pertuzumab and HER2 vaccines. Among the estrogen-independent breast cancers, the basal-like subtype has low survival, and therapeutic improvement is a priority. Crosstalk between ER and HER2 signaling pathways means that combinatory therapies may hold the key to enhancement of treatment responses.

Tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed with 406 cases of breast cancer. The cases were subgrouped into luminal A, luminal B, HER-2, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) based on the results of immunohistochemical stains for ER, PR, HER-2, and Ki-67 and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for HER-2. One hundred and sixty-eight cases were allocated to the subgroup luminal A; 87 cases to the luminal B; 32 cases to the HER-2; and 119 cases to the TNBC. The TNBC group showed the highest negative rate for p16, and the luminal B and HER-2 groups showed the highest positive rate for p16 (P < 0.001). Alteration of p16 was the highest in the luminal B and HER-2 groups, and pRB expression rate was the highest in the HER-2 group and lowest in the luminal A group. In addition, p16(+)/pRB(+) type was the most common in the luminal B group, p16(+)/pRB(-) in the luminal A group, and p16(-)/pRB(+) in the TNBC group (P < 0.001). Altered p16/pRB(+) and non-altered p16/pRB(+) type was the most common in the luminal B, and altered p16/pRB(-) and non-altered p16/pRB(+) type was the most common in the luminal A (P < 0.001). Alteration of p16 was correlated with higher Ki67 labeling index (LI) (P = 0.013), and p16 negativity was correlated with ER negativity (P = 0.002), PR negativity (P = 0.004), and higher Ki67 LI (P < 0.001). pRB positivity was correlated with PR negativity (P = 0.009), HER-2 positivity (P = 0.001), and higher Ki-67 LI (P < 0.001). In luminal group A, p16 alteration was correlated with shorter DFS in univariate analysis (P = 0.024). In conclusion, Expression rates of p16 and pRB differ according to the molecular subgroups of breast cancer and they subsequently correlate with clnicopathologic factors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by a lack of expression of estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors, and genetically most of them fall into the basal subgroup of breast cancer. The important issue of TNBC is poorer clinical outcome and absence of effective targeted therapy. In this study, we sought to identify DNA copy number alterations and expression of relevant genes characteristic of TNBC to discover potential therapeutic targets. Frozen tissues from 114 breast cancers were analyzed using high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization. The classification into subtype was determined by estrogen and progesterone receptor expression, and by the presence or absence of gain on the ERBB2 containing clone. The ACE algorithm was used for calling gain and loss of clones. Twenty-eight cases (25%) were classified as TNBC. Recurrent gains (> or =25%) unique to TNBC were 9p24-p21, 10p15-p13, 12p13, 13q31-q34, 18q12, 18q21-q23, and 21q22. Two published gene expression array data sets comparing basal subtype versus other subtype breast cancers were used for searching candidate genes. Of the genes upregulated in the basal subtype, 45 of 686 genes in one data set and 59 of 1,428 in the second data set were found to be located in the gained regions. Of these candidate genes, gain of NFIB (9p24.1) was specific for TNBC in a validation set by real-time PCR. In conclusion, we have identified recurrently gained regions characteristic of TNBC, and found that NFIB copy number and expression is increased in TNBC across the data sets.

Heterodimerization of HER2 with other HER family members results in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of signal transduction pathways. HER2 overexpression increases the translation of fatty acid synthase (FASN), and FASN overexpression markedly increases HER2 signaling, which results in enhanced cell growth. However, the molecular mechanism and regulation of HER2 and FASN interaction are not well defined. Lapatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2 in breast cancer cells, resulting in apoptosis. We hypothesized that FASN is directly phosphorylated by HER2, resulting in enhanced signaling and tumor progression in breast cancer cells.;Using mass spectrometry, we identified FASN as one of the proteins that is dephosphorylated by lapatinib in SKBR3 breast cancer cells. Immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, a kinase assay, a FASN enzymatic activity assay, an invasion assay, a cell viability assay and zymography were used to determine the role of FASN phosphorylation in invasion of SKBR3 and BT474 cells. The FASN inhibitor C75 and small interfering RNA were used to downregulate FASN expression and/or activity.;Our data demonstrated that FASN is phosphorylated when it is in complex with HER2. FASN phosphorylation was induced by heregulin in HER2-overexpressing SKBR3 and BT474 breast cancer cells. Heregulin-induced FASN phosphorylation resulted in increased FASN enzymatic activity, which was inhibited by lapatinib. The FASN inhibitor C75 suppressed FASN activity by directly inhibiting HER2 and FASN phosphorylation. Blocking FASN phosphorylation and activity by lapatinib or C75 suppressed the activity of matrix metallopeptidase 9 and inhibited invasion of SKBR3 and BT474 cells.;FASN phosphorylation by HER2 plays an important role in breast cancer progression and may be a novel therapeutic target in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.",

Overexpression of HER2, usually in association with gene amplification, occurs in approximately 25-30% of breast cancers. There are currently several different methods available to evaluate HER2 status, e.g. immunohistochemical (IHC), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays. The HER2 protein is a viable therapeutic target. The humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) has demonstrated activity in clinical trials in women with metastatic breast cancer overexpressing HER2. The mechanisms of the action of this antibody involve disruption of DNA repair and induction of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Response rates to the antibody given as a single agents in the treatment of HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer have ranged from 12 to 27%. Patients who received trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy had a significantly longer time to progression, higher overall survival compared with patients who had received chemotherapy alone. In the treatment of women with HER2 overexpressing tumors an overall response rate of 57% for combination trastuzumab plus paclitaxel compared with 25% for paclitaxel alone was found. Trastuzumab has an important role in the treatment of HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. Its place in adjuvant treatment has not been proved up to now. The optimal use of trastuzumab in the treatment of HER2 positive advanced breast cancer is under active investigation. Due to the high rate of clinical activity and low incidence of severe toxicity trastuzumab is a very promising drug in the treatment of breast cancer. The author's purpose was to summarize the results of the trials using trastuzumab treatment, and discuss the methods used to determine the HER2 status.",

Serum samples were collected from 58 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma before first-line chemotherapy for advanced disease, and the levels of circulating HER2 ECD were measured using an enzyme immunoassay. Immunohistochemistry with anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody CB11 was used to assess the overexpression of HER2 in the primary tumors. When 450 fmol/ml was used as a cutoff, 24 cases (41%) had elevated HER2 ECD levels. Elevated levels of circulating HER2 ECD were associated with the expression of HER2 in the primary tumor tissue and with the metastatic tumor burden (evaluated with the marker CA 15-3; P = 0.032 and P = 0.002, respectively) but not with variables such as menopausal status, stage at diagnosis, previous adjuvant therapy, or the number of metastatic sites. The levels of circulating HER2 ECD correlated inversely with the response to treatment. The probability of obtaining a complete response to chemotherapy was significantly lower (P = 0.021) in patients with elevated HER2 ECD levels (0%; 95% confidence interval, 0-13%) compared with patients with nonelevated HER2 (26%; 95% confidence interval, 12-45%). In addition, the duration of clinical response was significantly shorter in patients with elevated HER2 ECD, compared with the cases with nonelevated HER2 (7.5 versus 11 months; P = 0.035). In conclusion, elevated levels of circulating HER2 ECD in patients with metastatic breast cancer correlate with reduced efficacy of a paclitaxel-doxorubicin chemotherapy combination. We suggest that the poor response rate associated with HER2 expression in advanced breast cancer may not be reversed by aggressive chemotherapy alone.",

In this paper, the relevance of SATB1 and HER2 expression was assessed in human breast cancer tissues, and their influence on tumor histological grade and patients' survival was explored.;Using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), 169 patients with breast cancer were assessed for SATB1 expression, HER2 amplification and hormone-receptor (HR) expression. The effects of SATB1 expression on HER2 and HR expression as well as their association with clinicopathologic characteristics were further analyzed by statistical evaluation.;SATB1 expression was correlated with HER2 expression in breast cancer(r = 0.191; p = 0.013). SATB1, HER2 and SATB1/HER2 co-expression was negatively correlated with HR expression (r = -0.228, p = 0.003; r = -0.338, p = 0.000; r = -0.527, p = 0.000, respectively).

This is the first report to examine the effect of dual silencing of HER-2 and VEGF genes on tumor growth and invasiveness. We have designed nine HER-2 siRNAs and ten VEGF siRNAs, and identified potent siRNA which can silence the target gene up to 75-83.5%. The most potent HER-2 and VEGF siRNAs were used to conduct functional studies in HER-2 positive breast cancer cells. Tumor invasiveness properties including cell morphology change, in vitro migration, cell spreading, and adhesion to ECM were evaluated. In addition, cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined after the siRNA treatment. Our data demonstrated for the first time that HER-2 siRNA could inhibit cell migration and invasion abilities. Combination of HER-2 and VEGF siRNAs exhibited synergistic silencing effect on VEGF. Both HER-2 siRNA and VEGF siRNA showed significant inhibition on cell migration and proliferation. HER-2 siRNA also demonstrated dramatic suppression on cell spreading and adhesion to ECM, as well as induction of apoptosis. Dual silencing of HER-2 and VEGF exhibited significant cell morphology change, and substantial suppression on migration, spreading, cell adhesion, and proliferation.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary breast cancers from 184 women (mean age, 60 years) were stained for topo II by automated immunohistochemistry. A topo II expression index (TI) was determined by counting the number of positive cells per high-power field and calculating an overall mean number of positive cells per high-power field. Tumors with a TI of more than 1 were considered positive, and those with a TI of 1 or less were considered negative. A cell proliferation index was determine d by automated immunohistochemistry using the MIB-1 antibody in an identical technique. HER-2/neu gene amplification (HER-2 amp) was determined by automated fluorescence in situ hybridization using the Ventana unique sequence probe. Fifty-nine (32%) of the tumors had a TI greater than 1. On univariate analysis, increased topo II expression correlated with decreased patient survival (p = .001), advanced tumor stage (p = .034), lymph node metastasis (p = .018), and HER-2 amp (p = .016). Tumor stage (p < .0001), node-positive status (p < .0001), tumor grade (p = .025), HER-2 amp (p < .0001), and MIB-1 overexpression (p = .002) also correlated with survival on univariate analysis. Topo II expression did not correlate with tumor size, grade, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor status, or disease recurrence. On multivariate analysis, stage (p < .0001), lymph node metastasis (p < .0001), and tumor grade (p = .002) all independently predicted disease-related death. Increased topo II expression is associated with an aggressive form of breast cancer featuring HER-2 amp and predicts disease-related death, lymph node metastasis, and advanced tumor stage.",

This review focuses on the potential clinical implications of the expression and coexistence of HER-2 splice variants in cancer cells in relation to breast cancer progression and drug resistance. \"Individualised\" strategies currently guide breast cancer management; in accordance, HER-2 splice variants may prove valuable as future prognostic and predictive factors, as well as potential therapeutic targets.

Biochemical and functional correlations of the two molecules have identified Grb7 to be a pivotal mediator downstream of ErbB2-mediated oncogenesis. However, it remains largely unknown how Grb7 is involve in the ErbB2-mediated tumorigenesis. In this study, we show that Grb7-mediated cell proliferation and growth are essential for the tumorigenesis that occurs in ErbB2-Grb7-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Intrinsically, EGF-induced de novo Grb7 tyrosine phosphorylation/activation recruits and activates Ras-GTPases and subsequently promotes the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, thereby stimulating tumor growth. Furthermore, we also found the anti-tumor effect could be synergized by co-treatment with Herceptin plus Grb7 knockdown in Sk-Br3 breast cancer cells. Our findings illustrate an underlying mechanism by which Grb7 promotes tumorigenesis through the formation of a novel EGFR-Grb7-Ras signaling complex, thereby highlighting the potential strategy of targeting Grb7 as an anti-breast cancer therapy.",

In addition, SKBR-3 cells, engineered for stable expression of t-DARPP, and HCC-1569 cells, which have constitutive expression of t-DARPP and are de novo resistant to trastuzumab, were used.;We reported > or =15-fold up-regulation of mRNA and protein levels of t-DARPP in HR-5 and HR-6 cells compared with their progenitor BT-474 trastuzumab-sensitive cells. The t-DARPP expression was not regulated by changes in its promoter DNA methylation levels. The SKBR-3 cells stably expressing t-DARPP developed resistance to trastuzumab compared with their parental cells and empty vector controls (P < 0.01). The trastuzumab-resistant cell lines showed a significant increase in pAKT (Ser(473)) and BCL2 protein levels. The small interfering RNA knockdown of t-DARPP in all trastuzumab-resistant cells led to a significant reduction in ERBB2, pAKT (Ser(473)), and BCL2 protein levels with a significant decrease in cell viability (P < or = 0.001) and an increase in cleaved caspase-3 levels, indicating the progression of these cells toward apoptosis. The t-DARPP protein was associated with both heat shock protein 90 and ERBB2 forming a potential protein complex.

Validation was performed with the use of published microarray data. We assessed cell growth and apoptosis of breast cancer cells after radiation using high-content image analysis.;HJURP was expressed at higher level in breast cancer than in normal breast tissue. HJURP mRNA levels were significantly associated with estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) grade, age and Ki67 proliferation indices, but not with pathologic stage, ERBB2, tumor size, or lymph node status. Higher HJURP mRNA levels significantly decreased disease-free and overall survival. HJURP mRNA levels predicted the prognosis better than Ki67 proliferation indices. In a multivariate Cox proportional-hazard regression, including clinical variables as covariates, HJURP mRNA levels remained an independent prognostic factor for disease-free and overall survival. In addition HJURP mRNA levels were an independent prognostic factor over molecular subtypes (normal like, luminal, Erbb2 and basal). Poor clinical outcomes among patients with high HJURP expression were validated in five additional breast cancer cohorts. Furthermore, the patients with high HJURP levels were much more sensitive to radiotherapy. In vitro studies in breast cancer cell lines showed that cells with high HJURP levels were more sensitive to radiation treatment and had a higher rate of apoptosis than those with low levels. Knock down of HJURP in human breast cancer cells using shRNA reduced the sensitivity to radiation treatment. HJURP mRNA levels were significantly correlated with CENPA mRNA levels.;HJURP mRNA level is a prognostic factor for disease-free and overall survival in patients with breast cancer and is a predictive biomarker for sensitivity to radiotherapy.",

Although these advances have shaped our understanding of the underlying biology of breast cancer, most clinical decisions are currently based on tumor expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).

This study aims to determine the prevalence of the HER-2 genotype and its association with breast cancer in the Greek Christian and Greek Muslim population of Thrace, Greece. In this case-control study, we genotyped 56 patients (43 Christians and 13 Muslims) with primary breast cancer and 45 healthy women (32 Christians and 13 Muslims) for the Ile655Val polymorphism, with the PCR-RFLP method. The Val allele and the Val-containing genotypes were significantly more frequent in Muslims than in Christians (p=0.020 and p=0.008, respectively). Among the Greek Christian population, a 5-fold and a 3.1-fold increase in risk of breast cancer was associated with the Val-Val genotype and the Ile-Val or Val-Val genotypes (95% CI, 1.3-18.4; p=0.017 and aOR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.2-8.3; p=0.025; respectively) compared to homozygous Ile-Ile. No significant association was found in the Muslim population.

This effect was even more pronounced in younger women. Among breast cancer patients, invasive carcinomas, low differentiation tumors, advanced stages, positive lymph nodes, high number of lymph nodes and HER-2 overexpression were more frequent in patients with allele Val than those with allele Ile. Our study proposes the allelic imbalance of Ile655Val polymorphism between Greek Christian and Greek Muslim populations of Thrace contributes to the inconsistent association between this SNP and breast cancer risk across these two different ethnic groups.

However the discrepancy rates of IHC for the four breast cancer biomarkers are frequently under debate, especially for Ki-67 which carries the highest degree of inter- and even intra-observer variability. Herein we describe a series of studies in FFPE specimens which aim to fully validate the analytical performance of the MammaTyper assay, including the site to site reproducibility of the individual marker measurements.;Tumor RNA was extracted with the novel RNXtract RNA extraction kit. Synthetic RNA was used to assess the sensitivity of the RNXtract kit. DNA and RNA specific qPCR assays were used so as to determine analyte specificity of RNXtract. For the assessment of limit of blank, limit of detection, analytical measurement range and PCR efficiency of the MammaTyper kit serial dilutions of samples were used. Analytical precision studies of MammaTyper were built around two different real time PCR platforms and involved breast tumor samples belonging to different subtypes analyzed across multiple sites and under various stipulated conditions. The MammaTyper assay robustness was tested against RNA input variations, alternative extraction methods and tumor cell content.;Individual assays were linear up to at least 32.33 and 33.56 Cqs (quantification cycles) for the two qPCR platforms tested. PCR efficiency ranged from 99 to 109 %. In qPCR platform 1, estimates for assay specific inter-site standard deviations (SD) were between 0.14 and 0.20 Cqs accompanied by >94 % concordant single marker assignments for all four markers. In platform 2, the inter-site SD estimates were between 0.40 and 0.66 Cqs while the concordance for single marker assignments was >94 % for all four markers. The agreement reached between the two qPCR systems located in one site was 100 % for ERBB2, 96.9 % for ESR1, 97.2 % for PGR and 98.6 % for MKI67. RT-qPCR for individual markers was stable up to a 64-fold dilution for a typical clinical sample. There was no change in assay performance detected at the level of individual markers or subtypes after using different RNA isolation methods. The presence of up to 80 % of surrounding non-tumor tissue including in situ carcinoma did not affect the assay output. Sixteen out of 20 RNXtract eluates yielded more than 50 ng/μl of RNA (average RNA output: 233 ng/μl), whereas DNA contamination per sample was restricted to less than 15 ng/μl. Median recovery rate of RNA extraction was 91.0 %.;In this study the performance characteristics of MammaTyper were successfully validated. The various sources of analytical perturbations resulted in negligible variations in individual marker assessments. Therefore, MammaTyper may serve as a technical improvement to current standards for decentralized FFPE-based routine assessment of the commonly used breast cancer biomarkers and for molecular subtyping of breast cancer specimens.",

NGAL is expressed in a variety of tumor types including breast carcinomas, but it is not known whether NGAL contributes directly to breast cancer progression. This study examines the relationship between NGAL expression in breast carcinomas and established clinical prognostic markers as well as clinical outcome. Using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays containing well characterized tumor samples from 207 breast cancer patients, NGAL was detected in 68 breast carcinomas in a cytoplasmic location. NGAL expression correlated strongly with negative steroid receptor status, HER-2/neu overexpression, poor histologic grade, the presence of lymph node metastases and a high Ki-67 proliferation index. In univariate survival analysis, NGAL expression was associated with decreased disease-specific survival and decreased disease-free survival in the entire cohort. In multivariate analysis, NGAL remained an independent prognostic marker for disease-free survival. In a subset of patients with estrogen receptor positive tumors, NGAL was significantly associated with decreased disease-free survival. The results show that NGAL expression is a predictor of poor prognosis in primary human breast cancer and suggest that NGAL detection may provide information for risk assessment and identify a subset of patients requiring more aggressive adjuvant therapy.",

Data on parity and age at first birth were collected from 743,623 women, 10,896 of whom were subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer.

In animal models, reduction of CXCR4 expression significantly abrogated metastatic disease and prolonged survival. In human breast cancers, CXCR4 overexpression may portend a worse clinical course. Recent data suggest that HER-2 up-regulates CXCR4, but whether this is applicable in the clinical setting is not known. In this study, we evaluated the role of CXCR4 overexpression in breast cancer and determined whether it can serve as a potential marker of tumor recurrence in HER-2 negative tumors.;One hundred three patients with stages I to III breast cancers and 6 benign breast tissues were prospectively accrued and analyzed. Study homogeneity was maintained by standardized treatment, surveillance, and compliance protocols. CXCR4 levels were detected using Western blots and results were quantified against 1 microg of HeLa cells (positive controls). HER-2 expression was evaluated using the Hercep program, (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) with a positive result defined as > or = 2. CXCR4 expression was defined as low (<6.6-fold) or high (> or = 6.6-fold). Primary endpoints were cancer recurrence and death. Statistical analysis performed included Spearman's correlation, independent samples t-test, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and log-rank test.;All 103 cancer specimens had CXCR4 overexpression (mean 6.6 +/- 4.7), while none of the 6 benign breast tissues had detectable level of CXCR4. There were 36 HER-2 (+) tumors and 67 HER-2 (-) tumors. There was no statistical significance in mean CXCR4 overexpression between HER-2 (+) [5.6] and HER-2 (-) [6.6] cancers (P = 0.3; independent samples t-test). Recurrences occurred in 18 of 103 patients (17%); 10 occurred in HER-2 (+) tumors, and 8 occurred in HER-2 (-) patients. CXCR4 expression level was not predictive of cancer recurrence (P = 0.80) or overall survival (P = 0.70) in the HER-2 (+) group. However, among HER-2 negative tumors, 7 of 8 recurrences occurred in the high CXCR4 group (P = 0.037). There was no correlation between the degree of CXCR4 overexpression with tumor size (r = 0.13, P = 0.22), nodal status (r = 0.019, P = 0.4), ER/PR status (r = 0.12, P = 0.29), and HER-2 status (r = 0.091, P = 0.36).;CXCR4 overexpression was observed in all 103 breast cancer specimens but was undetectable in benign breast tissues. CXCR4 overexpression does not correlate with tumor size, nodal status, ER/PR status, and HER-2 status. High CXCR4 overexpression had a significant impact on disease-free survival in HER-2 negative breast cancer patients and may help identify a subset of HER-2 negative breast cancers that have a more aggressive biological behavior.",

Secondary endpoint was to determine whether components of MS can individually increase the risk of specific breast cancer subtype.;Anthropometric and metabolic variables were correlated to breast cancer specific subgroups, retrospectively.

HER-2/neu and CA 15-3 values were measured in retrospective samples obtained from 59 patients with metastatic breast cancer undergoing treatment over a 6-12 month period. Serial changes in serum HER-2/neu and CA 15-3 were correlated with changes in clinical status on a visit-to-visit basis. For each pair of serial measurements, changes of equal to or greater than, or less than 15% for HER-2/neu and 21% for CA 15-3 were considered to indicate progression or lack of progression, respectively.;The ADVIA Centaur HER-2/neu assay demonstrated within-run imprecision and total imprecision ranging from 3.0-5.6% and from 3.2-5.7%, respectively. The upper limit of normal was 15.2 ng/mL (90% CI: 14.2-17.0 ng/mL). No significant interference (<5%) was seen with bilirubins, hemoglobin, triglycerides and cholesterol or therapeutic drugs commonly present in the sera of breast cancer patients. The minimum detectable concentration (analytical sensitivity) was found to be 0.5 ng/mL. The patient population in the clinical study included breast cancer patients who responded to therapy (stable, partial or complete response) or had disease progression. HER-2/neu levels showed a concordance of 78.1% (82/105 restaging time points) with the clinical course of disease, whereas CA 15-3 levels showed a concordance of 76.2% (80/105 restaging time points). The concordance with clinical status increased to 85.7% (90/105 restaging time points) when both results were used in combination as a series test.;The ADVIA Centaur HER-2/neu assay provides excellent analytical performance for serial testing of serum HER-2/neu levels. The clinical data demonstrate the usefulness of serum HER-2/neu in monitoring metastatic breast cancer patients during treatment. Furthermore, the results indicate that serum HER-2/neu and CA 15-3 may be useful in identifying disease progression or therapeutic response in different subgroups of women with metastatic breast cancer.",

Overexpression and high activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) are frequently associated with metastatic breast cancers and serve as a prognostic indicator of clinical outcome. MMP-2 is predominantly expressed in stromal fibroblasts and plays a pivotal role in regulating the invasive behavior of breast tumor cells. We hypothesized that ethanol may enhance the invasion of breast tumor cells by modulating the activity of fibroblastic MMP-2. With in vitro models (HS68 and CCD1056SK human fibroblasts), we showed that ethanol at physiologically relevant concentrations (50-200 mg/dl) activated MMP-2; conversely, at a higher concentration (400 mg/dl), it inhibited the MMP-2 activity. Consistently, conditioned medium collected from ethanol (50-200 mg/dl)-exposed fibroblasts markedly enhanced the invasive potential of breast cancer cells and mammary epithelial cells overexpressing ErbB2/HER2 (BT474, SKBR-3 and HB2(ErbB2) cells) but had little effect on cells with low ErbB2 levels (BT20 and HB2 cells). In contrast, conditioned medium obtained from ethanol (400 mg/dl)-treated fibroblasts inhibited cell invasion. Selective inhibitors of MMP-2 (SB-3CT and OA-Hy) eliminated ethanol-stimulated invasion, indicating that the effect of ethanol was mediated by MMP-2. Ethanol activated conventional PKCs and JNKs in fibroblasts; inhibitors of PKC (Go6850 and Go6976) and JNKs (SP600125) significantly inhibited ethanol-mediated MMP-2 activation as well as cell invasion, indicating that PKCs and JNKs play a role in ethanol-induced MMP-2 activation and cell invasion in vitro.

Thirty-five breast cancer patients were evaluated for detection of CK19 mRNA in their peripheral blood using CK19-specific primers and a nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. CK19 expression levels were detected in MCF7, T47D, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses.

Here, we describe the molecular cytogenetic/genetic characterization of two sister rat mammary tumor cell lines, HH-16 cl.2/1 and HH-16.cl.4, for the first time. Molecular cytogenetic analysis using rat and mouse chromosome paint probes and BAC/PAC clones allowed the characterization of clonal chromosome rearrangements; moreover, this strategy assisted in revealing detected breakpoint regions and complex chromosome rearrangements. This comprehensive cytogenetic analysis revealed an increase in the number of copies of the Mycn and Erbb2 genes in the investigated cell lines. To analyze its possible correlation with expression changes, relative RNA expression was assessed by real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR and RNA FISH. Erbb2 was found to be overexpressed in HH-16.cl.4, but not in the sister cell line HH-16 cl.2/1, even though these lines share the same initial genetic environment.

As these cell lines are commercially available and have been used in previous studies, the present detailed characterization improves their value as an in vitro cell model.

For breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women in the United States, early detection does allow for increased treatment options, including surgical resection, with a corresponding better patient response. Unfortunately, however, many patients' tumors are diagnosed following metastasis, thus making it more difficult to successfully treat the malignancy. There are, at present, no existing validated plasma/serum biomarkers for breast cancer. Only a few biomarkers (such as HER-2/neu, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor) have utility for diagnosis and prognosis. Thus, there is a great need for new biomarkers for breast cancer.

Differences in distribution of cancer biological characteristics between Māori and NZ European women were explored adjusting for age and socioeconomic deprivation in logistic regression models. Impacts of socioeconomic deprivation, stage and cancer biological characteristics on breast cancer mortality disparity between Māori and NZ European women were explored in Cox regression models.;Compared with NZ European women (n=2304), Māori women (n=429) had significantly higher rates of advanced and higher grade cancers. Māori women also had non-significantly higher rates of ER/PR negative and HER-2 positive breast cancers. Higher odds of advanced stage and higher grade remained significant for Māori after adjusting for age and deprivation. Māori women had almost a 100% higher age and deprivation adjusted breast cancer mortality hazard compared with NZ European women (HR=1.98, 1.55-2.54). Advanced stage and lower proportion of screen detected cancer in Māori explained a greater portion of the excess breast cancer mortality (HR reduction from 1.98 to 1.38), while the additional contribution through biological differences were minimal (HR reduction from 1.38 to 1.35).;More advanced cancer stage at diagnosis has the greatest impact while differences in biological characteristics appear to be a minor contributor for inequities in breast cancer mortality between Māori and NZ European women.

HER2 receptor family members function through dimerisation, which can lead to impact on cell function, growth and differentiation; however, their value in breast cancer development remains to be defined. This study aims to examine the relationships of HER2 heterodimers to breast cancer characteristics in trastuzumab naïve and treated cases. HER2 protein (IHC), HER2 gene (chromogenic ISH) and HER2 heterodimerisation status [chromogenic in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA)] were assessed in two breast cancer series prepared in tissue microarray (TMA) format. A range of signals/cell for each HER2 heterodimer was detected (0-34.6 signals/cell). The vast majority of cases with HER2 heterodimers showed HER2 gene amplification and/or protein expression. There was an association between HER2 dimerisation with HER3 and HER4 and their protein expression level but no such association was found in with HER1 (EGFR). Of the HER2+ cases, 74, 66, and 58 % showed heterodimers with EGFR, HER3 and HER4, respectively. 51 % of HER2+ tumours expressed all three heterodimers whereas 23 % of the cases did not show expression of any of the three heterodimers. There was an inverse association between the presence and levels of HER2 heterodimers and hormone receptor expression in HER2+ tumours. Tumours exhibiting high levels of HER2 heterodimers demonstrated aggressive clinicopathological features and poor outcome. In the HER2+ cases, dimerisation with EGFR and HER3 but not with HER4 showed an association with aggressive features. There was no association between HER2 heterodimers with patient breast cancer-specific survival or recurrence in HER2+ breast cancer in those patients receiving trastuzumab or not. Our results demonstrate that HER2 dimerisation is a complex process that may underlie the biological heterogeneity of HER2 positive tumours and may identify patients suitable for a specific targeted therapy but does not predict patient outcome for those receiving trastuzumab. PLA proved to be a useful tool for detecting, visualising and quantifying the frequency of protein-protein interactions in archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples.",

Computational analysis of the promoter composition of the genes within these signatures may provide a powerful method for deducing the regulatory transcriptional networks that mediate their collective function. In this study we have systematically analyzed the promoter composition of gene classes derived from previously established genetic signatures that recently have been shown to reliably and reproducibly distinguish five molecular subtypes of breast cancer associated with distinct clinical outcomes. Inferences made from the trends of transcription factor binding site enrichment in the promoters of these gene groups led to the identification of regulatory pathways that implicate discrete transcriptional networks associated with specific molecular subtypes of breast cancer. One of these inferred pathways predicted a role for nuclear factor-kappaB in a novel feed-forward, self-amplifying, autoregulatory module regulated by the ERBB family of growth factor receptors. The existence of this pathway was verified in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation and shown to be deregulated in breast cancer cells overexpressing ERBB2. This analysis indicates that approaches of this type can provide unique insights into the differential regulatory molecular programs associated with breast cancer and will aid in identifying specific transcriptional networks and pathways as potential targets for tumor subtype-specific therapeutic intervention.",

Breast cancer is a complex, heterogeneous disease classified into hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 overexpressing (HER2+) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) based on histological features. Endocrine therapy, the mainstay of treatment for hormone-responsive breast cancer involves use of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), selective estrogen receptor downregulators (SERDs) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs). Agents that target estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 such as tamoxifen and trastuzumab have been the most extensively used therapeutics for breast cancer. Crosstalk between ER and other signalling networks as well as epigenetic mechanisms have been envisaged to contribute to endocrine therapy resistance. TNBC, a complex, heterogeneous, aggressive form of breast cancer in which the cells do not express ER, progesterone receptor or HER2 is refractory to therapy. Several molecular targets are being explored to target TNBC including androgen receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Receptors, protein tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, proteases, PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, microRNAs (miRs) and long noncoding RNAs (lnRNAs) are potential therapeutic targets. miR-based therapeutic approaches include inhibition of oncomiRs by antisense oligonucleotides, restoration of tumour suppressors using miR mimics, and chemical modification of miRs. The lnRNA HOTAIR, a new player in tumour development and prognosis may have theranostic applications in breast cancer. Integration of nucleic acid sequencing studies with mass spectrometry-based peptide sequencing and posttranslational modifications will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of breast cancer and help in evolving therapeutic strategies.",

In this study, we show that HER2+ breast cancers are susceptible to PARP inhibition independent of an HR deficiency. HER2 overexpression in HER2 negative breast cancer cells was sufficient to render cells susceptible to the PARP inhibitors ABT-888 and AZD-2281 both in vitro and in vivo, which was abrogated by HER2 reduction. In addition, ABT-888 significantly inhibited NF-κB (p65/RelA) transcriptional activity in HER2+ but not HER2 negative breast cancer cells. This corresponded with a reduction in phosphorylated p65 and total IKKα levels, with a concomitant increase in IκBα. Overexpression of p65 abrogated cellular sensitivity to ABT-888, whereas IκBα overexpression reduced cell viability to a similar extent as ABT-888. Therefore, susceptibility of HER2+ breast cancer cells to PARP inhibition may be because of inhibition of NF-κB signaling driven by HER2. Our findings indicate that PARP inhibitors may be a novel therapeutic strategy for sporadic HER2+ breast cancer patients.",

It is estimated that 7% of women who have breast cancer will develop a subsequent second independent breast tumor within 10 years of the first. The status of estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and human growth hormone (HER2) receptors, individually and as phenotypic combinations, impacts the clinical course of breast cancer and may impact the course of subsequent primary tumors and patient survival. Our aims were to determine tumor marker phenotype concordance between first and second primary breast cancers (FPBC and SPBC), describe demographic and clinical characteristics, and examine first tumor treatments associated with phenotype concordance. A total of 76,209 cases of female invasive breast cancer were identified in the California Cancer Registry from 1999 to 2004. Of those, 1,407 women who had not undergone a prophylactic mastectomy, had information on the status of three tumor markers, and were diagnosed with an SPBC during the study period were selected. SPBCs were significantly smaller, diagnosed at a higher stage and were node positive. Patients whose FPBC was ER(+)/-/PR(+)/-/HER2- and triple negative (TN) (ER-/PR-/HER2-), often had concordant phenotypes for their SPBC. ER(+)/-/PR(+)/-/HER2+ and HER2-positive (ER-/PR-/HER2+) FPBCs, often had discordant phenotypes for their SPBC. ER(+)/-/PR(+)/-/HER2- SPBCs often lacked HER2 expression and were ER and/or PR positive. Tumor laterality and synchronicity significantly predicted concordance as did having a FPBC whose phenotypes were ER(+)/-/PR(+)/-/HER2+, HER2-positive and TN, while first primary tumor treatment with chemotherapy predicted discordance. The relationship between multiple primary breast cancer phenotype concordance and patient prognosis has yet to be determined. Our results indicate that SPBC surveillance strategies include consideration of FPBC phenotype. Although our results are provocative, they may have been influenced by current criteria used to determine tumor independence.",

First, Pin1 is prevalently over-expressed in kinds of breast cancer cell lines and tissues, such as MDA-MB-231 cell, MCF-7 cell, Her2+, ERα+, and basal-like breast cancer subtypes. Second, Pin1 amplifies many oncogenic signaling pathways, inhibits multiple tumor suppressors, promotes the angiogenesis and metastasis of breast cancer cells, and enhances the resistance of breast cancer cells to anti-tumor medicines. Third, inhibiting Pin1 blocks most of these detrimental effects in a great number of breast cancer cell lines. These findings suggest Pin1 as a promising diagnostic biomarker as well as an efficient therapeutic target for breast cancer. It is strongly expected that a Pin1-positive subtype of breast cancers should be extremely concerned and that the therapeutic efficacy of Pin1 inhibitors on breast cancer patients should be evaluated as soon as possible. Nonetheless, Pin1-based therapeutic strategies for breast cancer still deserve some debates. Hence, we give the predictions of several important issues, such as application precondition, side effects, and personalized medication, when Pin1 inhibitors are used in the breast cancer therapy.

        "Doc_abstract":"Despite an obvious central role of p53 in the hallmarks of cancer, TP53 status is not yet used for the management of breast cancer. Recent findings may lead to reconsider the role of p53 in breast cancer. TP53 mutations are the most frequent genetic alterations in breast cancer, observed in 30% of breast carcinomas. Their distribution is highly linked to molecular tumor subtypes found in 26% of luminal tumors (17% of luminal A, 41% of luminal B), in 50% of HER2 amplified tumors, in 69% of molecular apocrine breast carcinomas and in 88% of basal-like carcinomas. The type of mutation is linked to the tumor subtype with higher frequency of base-pair substitutions in luminal tumors, whereas molecular apocrine and basal-like tumors present much higher frequency of complex mutations (deletions/insertions). The timing of TP53 mutation also depends on the tumor subtype, being the first important event in luminal tumors but occurring after PTEN loss in basal-like tumors. Regarding response to cytotoxic chemotherapy, the situation is far from the p53-dependent apoptosis paradigm with subsequent clinical response. We reported that TP53 mutated non inflammatory locally advanced breast carcinomas had a high rate of complete pathological response to dose-dense doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, while TP53 wild-type (WT) tumors never achieved complete response. Using human breast cancer xenograft models, we suggested that this could be due to the induction of senescence in TP53 WT tumor cells. A recent work confirmed these findings in MMTV-Wnt1 mammary tumors, showing that growth arrest and senescent phenotype, not apoptosis, were induced in TP53 WT tumors following doxorubicin treatment, while lack of arrest in mutant tumors resulted in aberrant mitoses, cell death and a superior clinical response. Furthermore, in ER positive (ER(+)) breast tumors, it has been recently reported that ER represses the p53-mediated apoptotic response induced by DNA damage. Taken together, these data can help to better understand p53-mediated response to doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in breast cancer: in ER(+) TP53 WT breast cancers, ER-induced inhibition of p53 apoptotic response would lead preferentially to tumor cell senescence and subsequent resistance to treatment. Conversely, in ER negative (ER(-)) TP53 mutated breast cancers, accumulation of genetic abnormalities would lead to mitotic catastrophe and subsequent better response. In view of these recent results, p53 impact in breast cancer should be reconsidered. ",

Two important factors have been taken into account in compiling these recommendations: (1) the lack of level I evidence to convincingly demonstrate the value of HER2 as a predictive marker for resistance or sensitivity to chemo- and hormonal therapy, and (2) the recently published pivotal phase II and III trial data proving the efficacy of trastuzumab as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.",

We have correlated this information to age, tumor stage at diagnosis (TNM), nodal involvement, and receptor status (ER and PgR). Survival analysis was conducted dividing the patients in two different groups according to date of diagnosis: one group diagnosed in 2004 and a second group in 2005-2006. In the 460 cases of 2004, nodal involvement, receptor status, age at diagnosis and TNM maintained a strong predictive value (p < 0.0001). In this group of patients, overall survival was significantly different according to the HER2 expression levels (p = 0.001). In the second group of patients (941 incident cases in 2005-2006) there was a statistically significant survival difference comparing patients with high levels of HER2 expression treated with trastuzumab versus those untreated (p = 0.006). Our data show that elevated levels of HER2 are a negative prognostic factor. In addition, patients overexpressing HER2 show a significant increase of overall survival when treated with trastuzumab.",

However, the mechanisms underlying upregulation of the β2-AR expression in Her2-overexpressing breast cancer cells are not fully understood. The clinical significance of the β2-AR overexpression in breast cancer is unclear.;Human breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MCF-7/Her2 were transfected with the let-7 mimics or inhibitors. The expression of β2-AR was analyzed by Western blot. The β2-AR status in primary and metastatic sites of breast cancer and the human breast cancer tissue microarrays containing 49 primary tumors and 50 metastatic lymph node tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The correlation of lymph node metastasis with the β2-AR level was determined in 59 primary tumor tissues from the patients with Her2-positive breast cancer. The clinical prognostic significance of the β2-AR overexpression in the patients with Her2-positive breast cancers was evaluated by a retrospective study.;The let-7f level in Her2-overexpressing breast cancer cells SKBR3 and BT474 was significantly lower than that in MCF-7 cells, which express low level of Her2. Ectopic expression of Her2 in MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/Her2) represses the expression of microRNA let-7f, which is previously identified to regulate baseline β2-AR expression. The treatment with MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 or PD184352 effectively restored the let-7f level, suggesting that Her2-overexpression-mediated ERK constitutive activation inhibited let-7f, leading to the upregulation of the β2-AR expression. The transfection with the let-7f mimics markedly downregulated the β2-AR level, whereas the let-7 inhibitor significantly upregulated the β2-AR expression in both parental MCF-7 and MCF-7/Her2 cells. In addition, treatment of MCF-7/Her2 cells with isoproterenol resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction of the let-7f expression, demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of Her2 overexpression on let-7f can be reinforced by agonist-triggered β2-AR activation. We further demonstrate that high level of β2-AR associates with lymph node metastasis and poor outcome in the patients with Her2-positive breast cancer.;The mutual and reciprocal interaction between Her2, β2-AR, and let-7f may maintain a high level of β2-AR in breast cancer cells. Our data suggest that β2-AR may be a new useful biomarker for predicting prognosis in Her2-positive breast cancer and may also be a promising selective therapeutic target for the aggressive subtype of breast cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Overexpression of the adverse prognostic marker ERBB2 occurs in 30% of breast cancers and is associated with aggressive disease and poor outcomes. Our recent findings have shown that NR1D1 and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ)-binding protein (PBP) act through a common pathway in upregulating several genes in the de novo fatty acid synthesis network, which is highly active in ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells. NR1D1 and PBP are functionally related to PPARγ, a well-established positive regulator of adipogenesis and lipid storage. Here, we report that inhibition of the PPARγ pathway reduces the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive population in ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells. Results from in vitro tumorsphere formation assays demonstrate that the PPARγ antagonists GW9662 and T0070907 decrease tumorsphere formation in ERBB2-positive cells, but not other breast cells. We show that the mechanism by which GW9662 treatment causes a reduction in ALDH-positive population cells is partially due to ROS, as it can be rescued by treatment with N-acetyl-cysteine. Furthermore, global gene expression analyses show that GW9662 treatment suppresses the expression of several lipogenic genes, including ACLY, MIG12, FASN and NR1D1, and the stem-cell related genes KLF4 and ALDH in BT474 cells. Antagonist treatment also decreases the level of acetylation in histone 3 and histone 4 in BT474 cells, compared with MCF7 cells. In vivo, GW9662 pre-treatment inhibits the tumor-seeding ability of BT474 cells. Together, these results show that the PPARγ pathway is critical for the cancer stem cell properties of ERBB2-positive breast cancer cells. ",

In this study, we examined the expression of IGF-1R in the different molecular subtypes of breast cancer. The effects of IGF-1R expression on the survival rates and outcomes of breast cancer were also examined.;IGF-1R expression was evaluated immunohistochemically in tissue microarray blocks constructed from 1,198 invasive breast cancer samples collected from six medical institutions. IGF-1R expression was interpreted according to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu immunohistochemistry scoring system. Scores of 2+ and 3+ were considered positive.;Positive IGF-1R expression was observed in 65.4% of invasive breast cancer samples. IGF-1R expression was detected in all cancer subtypes (luminal A, 84.4%; luminal B, 75.9%; HER2, 21.2%; triple-negative, 46.6%) and was found to be associated with a positive hormone receptor status and the absence of HER2 amplification (p<0.001). Positive IGF-1R expression was significantly associated with high survival rates (p=0.014). However, a multivariate analysis revealed that the expression levels of IGF-1R did not achieve statistical significance. In the triple-negative cancer subtype, IGF-1R expression was found to be associated with a lower disease-free survival rate (p=0.031).;Positive IGF-1R expression is associated with a favorable prognosis in breast cancer.

Several prognostic factors have been identified for patients with metastatic breast cancer, including tumor volume and location, comorbid conditions, response to prior therapy, and the presence of molecular tumor markers (e.g., estrogen receptors [ER] and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]). Metastatic breast cancer is usually incurable, and the goals of therapy are palliation of symptoms, extending survival, and improving quality of life. Options for the medical management of metastatic breast cancer include endocrine therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and targeted biologic agents. Treatment guidelines developed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network generally recommend endocrine therapy for patients with ER-positive or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive disease, for patients with bone or soft tissue metastasis, or those with asymptomatic visceral disease. Cytotoxic chemotherapy alone is usually recommended for patients with ER-negative/PR-negative disease, who have symptomatic visceral disease, or whose tumors are HER2-negative or rapidly growing.

Here, we show that CDCP1 and HER2 are frequently co-overexpressed in metastatic breast tumors and associated with poor patient prognosis. HER2 and CDCP1 co-overexpression leads to increased transformation ability, cell migration, and tumor formation in vivo, and enhanced HER2 activation and downstream signaling in different breast cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that CDCP1 binds to HER2 through its intracellular domain, thereby increasing HER2 interaction with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-SRC (SRC), leading to trastuzumab resistance. Taken together, our findings establish that CDCP1 is a modulator of HER2 signaling and a biomarker for the stratification of breast cancer patients with poor prognosis. Our results also provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting of CDCP1 in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.",

We have now done validation experiments on a group of three cell membrane components that had previously not been implicated in breast cancer. We also studied the expression of three other cell membrane proteins known to play a role in mammary neoplasia.;By immunohistochemistry, we examined up to 130 archival breast carcinomas for Celsr2, E-cadherin, Kai1, and CD9 expression. The expression levels of NET-6 and TROP-2 were determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in a subset of frozen tumors. We also studied fresh pellets and paraffin-embedded cell buttons of nine human breast cell lines. The relationship between the expression of all six membrane proteins and a variety of pathologic and biological variables, including estrogen receptor, HER2, and epidermal growth factor receptor status, was also examined. The NET-6 gene was transfected into a low-expressing cell line, and the effect on cellular morphology, growth, and invasion in vitro was recorded.;Celsr2 was down-regulated in one cell line and in 7% of breast cancers. E-cadherin, Kai1, and CD9 were down-regulated in 35%, 76%, and 79% of tumors, respectively, confirming the important role of these markers in human mammary neoplasia. In breast cancer cell lines and tissues, TROP-2 was generally expressed at low levels, although a few specimens showed relative overexpression. NET-6 levels were lower in HER2-negative breast carcinoma cells. In addition, NET-6 was markedly down-regulated in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers, and expression was lowest in \"basal-like\" tumors. Ectopic expression of NET-6 in low-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells altered cellular morphology, inhibited growth in vitro, and decreased invasion in a Boyden chamber assay.;We have confirmed the expression of three new membrane markers that had previously not been implicated in human breast cancer, and one of them (NET-6) was correlated with HER2 and estrogen receptor status. NET-6 levels were decreased in estrogen receptor-negative and high-grade tumors, and ectopic expression of this gene had an inhibitory effect on proliferation and invasion. Thus, NET-6 may represent a novel breast cancer suppressor gene.",

Therapeutic targeting of HER-2 with humanized antibody derived oligopeptide may be a promising approach to the treatment of breast cancer.

Pertuzumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody (2C4), binds to extracellular domain II of the HER-2 receptor and inhibits its ability to dimerize with other HER receptors blocking the cell growth, signaling and apoptosis induction. The unique binding pocket on HER-2 for pertuzumab provides an important target domain for creation of new anticancer drugs. In the present work an efficient oligopeptide was designed by our computational method that interacts with pertuzumab binding sites of HER-2.

Using the intrinsic set of approximately 500 genes derived in the Norway/Stanford breast cancer data, we validated the existence of five molecular subtypes--basal-like, ERBB2, luminal A/B and normal-like--and characterized these subtypes extensively with the use of conventional clinical variables.;We found an overall 77.5% concordance between the centroid prediction of the Swedish cohort by using the Norway/Stanford signature and the k-means clustering performed internally within the Swedish cohort. The highest rate of discordant assignments occurred between the luminal A and luminal B subtypes and between the luminal B and ERBB2 subtypes. The subtypes varied significantly in terms of grade (p < 0.001), p53 mutation (p < 0.001) and genomic instability (p = 0.01), but surprisingly there was little difference in lymph-node metastasis (p = 0.31). Furthermore, current users of hormone-replacement therapy were strikingly over-represented in the normal-like subgroup (p < 0.001). Separate analyses of the patients who received endocrine therapy and those who did not receive any adjuvant therapy supported the previous hypothesis that the basal-like subtype responded to adjuvant treatment, whereas the ERBB2 and luminal B subtypes were poor responders.;We found that the intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer are broadly present in a diverse collection of patients from a population-based cohort in Sweden.

Synergistic interactions at clinically relevant drug concentrations were observed for rhuMAb HER2 in combination with cisplatin (CI=0.48, P=0.003), thiotepa (CI=0.67, P=0.0008), and etoposide (CI=0.54, P=0.0003).

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software for Windows; we used nonparametric tests (Chi-square and Mann-Whitney), and the level of significance was set at p < 0.05.;We found a significant association between breast cancer diagnosed after menopause and thyroid disease (p < 0.003). Moreover, we analyzed the role of thyroid autoimmunity identifying an association between chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and breast cancer diagnosed before menopause (p < 0.05). Regarding receptor profile of breast carcinoma, we have found an increased expression of estrogen receptors in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis compared to patients with any other thyroid diseases (p < 0.03). Contrariwise, we do not have found any difference between the group with every thyroid disease and the group without thyroid disease (p < 1.00). We did not find other statistically significant associations with breast cancer's parameters like family history, tumor size, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, cancer clinical and pathological stage, differentiation grade and expression of Ki67, p53 and Her2 in the two main groups with or without thyroid disease. Likewise, we did not found other statistically significant association between hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism and breast cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Metastatic breast cancer is a partially chemotherapy-sensitive neoplasm. Most chemotherapy groups have activity in this disease, and the most active single drugs are the taxanes, especially docetaxel (Taxotere; Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Parsippany, NJ), and the anthracyclines. The alkylating agents, antimetabolites, and vinca alkaloids are also widely used. The platinum coordination complexes, which are widely used in oncology, are also active in metastatic breast cancer, but the availability of other drugs that are less toxic and easier to administer has resulted in their having a strictly limited use in this setting. Cisplatin appears to be somewhat more active than carboplatin, but direct comparative studies are lacking. The identification of the prominent activity of the taxanes has led to the investigation of wholly novel non-anthracycline-containing combination regimens, and platinum/taxane doublets appear to be particularly active. More recently, reports that trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), a novel monoclonal antibody directed against the protein product of the HER2/(neu) oncogene, has a powerful synergistic interaction with docetaxel and with platinum agents have prompted evaluation of the triplet docetaxel/platinum/trastuzumab in the therapy of metastatic breast cancer.",

In the current study, we evaluated the effect of targeting HER2 on radiosensitization of human breast cancer cells. Using six breast cancer cell lines with various levels of HER2 (BT474, SKBR3, MDA453, MCF7, ZR75B, and MDA468), we found that trastuzumab (Herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody that may inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation but does not induce apoptosis when used alone, enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis of the cells in a HER2 level-dependent manner. We furthered this study in MCF7 cells transfected for high levels of HER2 (MCF7HER2). Compared with parental or control vector-transfected MCF7 cells, MCF7HER2 cells showed increased phosphorylation of at least two important HER2 downstream molecules, protein kinase B/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and increased resistance to radiotherapy, as shown by reduced induction of apoptosis and increased cell clonogenic survival after radiation. Exposure of the cells to trastuzumab down-regulated the levels of HER2 and reduced phosphorylation levels of Akt and MAPK in MCF7HER2 cells, and sensitized these cells to radiotherapy. When specific inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and MAPK kinase (MEK) pathways were used, we found that exposure of MCF7HER2 cells to the PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 inhibited Akt phosphorylation and radiosensitized the cells, whereas the radiosensitization effect by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 was relatively weaker, albeit the phosphorylation of MAPK was reduced by PD98059 treatment. Our results indicate that the PI3-K pathway might be the major pathway for trastuzumab-mediated radiosensitization of breast cancer cells.",

Sentinel lymph node (SN) mapping is now in widespread use, in concert with the general trend toward trying to decrease the morbidity of breast cancer surgery. With every advance, however, comes new challenges, and there was a timely presentation from Giuliano's group addressing the controversial issue of how to interpret the presence of cells in the SN seen only with keratin stains but not by routine hematoxylin and eosin stains. Two abstracts addressed the issue of whether for certain women with invasive breast cancer radiation therapy could be omitted after lumpectomy. Another interesting topic related to hormonal issues in the adjuvant treatment of premenopausal women. An analysis from the ZIPP-TRIAL reported on bone marrow density studies in young women given two years of ovarian suppression in the adjuvant setting: it seems that the loss of bone density may be reversible and, more interestingly, may be prevented with concurrent tamoxifen. Two other presentations looked at the prognostic significance of drug-induced amenorrhea in young women treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and at the efficacy of ovarian suppression during chemotherapy in preserving fertility. In an unpublicized presentation, Mary-Claire King presented very interesting results from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Breast Cancer Prevention Trial suggesting that tamoxifen may be an effective chemopreventive drug for women with BRCA2, but not BRCA1, mutations. Two important presentations re-analyzed the outcome of the pivotal trials using Herceptin to treat metastatic breast cancer and nicely show that FISH analysis of HER-2 overexpression is a more accurate indicator of response to Herceptin than immunohistochemical staining. Finally, there were two interesting presentations related to tamoxifen resistance which may be relevant clinically, pertaining to subsequent raloxifene use and the interaction of the estrogen receptor and EGF receptor pathways, respectively.",

Immunohistochemistry, methylation-specific PCR (MSP), quantitative real-time (qPCR), westernblot and cytotoxicity assay techniques were employed. Thwe results revealed that there was a statistically negative correlation between GCS CpG islands methylation and GCSphenotype in patients with breast cancer. GCS CpG islands methylation was negatively associated with high ER, meanwhile positively with high HER-2 status. Similar results were obtained from the analysis of breast cancer cell lines. Treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dc) changed the GCS promoter methylation pattern in three sensitive cells and also caused increased drug resistance of them. These results suggested that the changes of DNA methylation status of the GCS promoter correlates with multidrug resistance in breast cancer.",

Cancer Res. 68 (21), 8661-8666 (2008). The transcription factor Y-box binding protein (YB)-1 is highly expressed in breast cancer cells and is strongly linked with breast cancer patient prognosis. In this paper, siRNA knockdown of YB-1 was used to investigate breast cancer cell proliferation. Six breast cancer cell lines that either overexpress HER-2 or were triple negative demonstrated growth inhibition following YB-1 knockdown. In particular, YB-1 knockdown induced apoptosis in BT-474-m1 and Au565 cells. Knockdown of YB-1 also decreased phosphorylation of STAT3S727, ERK1/2T202/Y204, mTORS2448 and total mTOR expression. When STAT3 was knocked down by siSTAT3, apoptosis was induced and constitutively active phosphorylated STAT3 was found to rescue YB-1-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, YB-1 knockdown remarkably suppressed colony formation in a soft agar assay, while delayed tumor formation was observed in mice. YB-1 knockdown inhibited cell growth and it is thought to involve induction of apoptosis via the mTOR/STAT3 intracellular signaling pathway.

Thus, it is conceivable that combined therapy with anti-oestrogen and anti-HER2 antibody might be more effective.

Compared to patients with earlier stage disease, patients with de novo metastatic disease were significantly more likely to have HER2+ tumors (HR+/HER2+: OR 1.29, 95 % CI 1.17-1.42; HR-/HER2+: OR 1.40, 95 %CI 1.25-1.57, vs. HR+/HER2-). Median survival improved over time, but varied substantially across race/ethnicity (Asians: 34 months; African Americans: 6 months), neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) (highest: 34 months, lowest: 20 months), and molecular subtype (HR+/HER2+: 45 months; triple negative: 12 months). In a multivariable model, triple negative (RH 2.85, 95 % CI 2.50-3.24) and HR-/HER2+ (RH 1.60, 95 % CI 1.37-1.87) had worse, while HR+/HER2+ had similar, risk of all-cause death compared to HR+/HER2- breast cancer.;De novo metastatic breast cancer was more likely to be HER2+. Among metastatic tumors, those that were HER2+ had better survival than other subtypes.",

The percentage of breast cancer patients positive for cfDNA (92.5%) was significantly higher than that of controls (55%). Also, mean concentration of cfDNA was significantly higher than in the control group (<0.05). Most Her-2 positive patients had long cfDNA fragments, this being significant as compared to Her-2 negative patients (<0.05). Metastasis was also positively linked to significantly higher cfDNA (<0.05) and the mean cfDNA integrity index was significantly higher in non-responders compared to treatment responders (<0.05). In conclusion, both qualitative and quantitative aspects of cfDNA and its different fragments in breast cancer patients could be related to prognosis, metastasis and treatment response.

However, using current methods roughly one quarter of breast tumors cannot be classified into one or another molecular subtype. To explore the possibility that the unclassifiable samples might comprise one or more novel subtypes we employed a collection of publically available breast tumor datasets with accompanying clinical information to assemble 1,593 transcript profiles: 25% of these samples could not be assigned to one of the current molecular subtypes of breast cancer. All of the unclassifiable samples could be grouped into a new molecular subtype, which we termed \"luminal-like\". We also identified the luminal-like subtype in an independent collection of tumor samples (NKI295). We found that patients harboring tumors of the luminal-like subtype have a better prognosis than those with basal-like breast cancer, a similar prognosis to those with ERBB2+, luminal B or claudin-low tumors, but a worse prognosis than patients with luminal A or normal-like breast tumors. Our findings suggest the occurrence of another molecular subtype of breast cancer that accounts for the vast majority of previously unclassifiable breast tumors. ",

Trastuzumab, a humanized antibody directed against an epitope on subdomain IV of the extracellular domain of HER2 is used for therapy of HER2-overexpressing mammary tumors. However, many tumors are either natively resistant or acquire resistance against Trastuzumab. Antibodies directed to different epitopes on the extracellular domain of HER2 are promising candidates for replacement or combinatorial therapy. For example, Pertuzumab that binds to subdomain II of HER2 extracellular domain and inhibits receptor dimerization is under clinical trial. Alternative antibodies directed to novel HER2 epitopes may serve as additional tools for breast cancer therapy. Our aim was to generate novel anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies inhibiting the growth of breast cancer cells, either alone or in combination with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).;Mice were immunized against SK-BR-3 cells and recombinant HER2 extracellular domain protein to produce monoclonal antibodies. Anti-HER2 antibodies were characterized with breast cancer cell lines using immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, western blot techniques. Antibody epitopes were localized using plasmids encoding recombinant HER2 protein variants. Antibodies, either alone or in combination with TNF-α, were tested for their effects on breast cancer cell proliferation.;We produced five new anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies, all directed against conformational epitope or epitopes restricted to the native form of the extracellular domain. When tested alone, some antibodies inhibited modestly but significantly the growth of SK-BR-3, BT-474 and MDA-MB-361 cells displaying ERBB2 amplification. They had no detectable effect on MCF-7 and T47D cells lacking ERBB2 amplification. When tested in combination with TNF-α, antibodies acted synergistically on SK-BR-3 cells, but antagonistically on BT-474 cells. A representative anti-HER2 antibody inhibited Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation leading to cyclin D1 accumulation and growth arrest in SK-BR-3 cells, independently from TNF-α.;Novel antibodies against extracellular domain of HER2 may serve as potent anti-cancer bioactive molecules. Cell-dependent synergy and antagonism between anti-HER2 antibodies and TNF-α provide evidence for a complex interplay between HER2 and TNF-α signaling pathways. Such complexity may drastically affect the outcome of HER2-directed therapeutic interventions.",

Many of the cell lines displayed prominent, localized DNA amplifications by CGH. One-third of these loci affected breast cancer oncogenes, whose amplifications were validated with specific probes: 17q12 (two cell lines with ERBB2 amplifications), 11q13 (two with cyclin-D1), 8p11-p12 (two with FGFR1) and 10q25 (one with FGFR2). Gains and amplifications affecting 8q were the most common genetic alterations in these cell lines with the minimal, common region of involvement at 8q22-q23. No high-level MYC (at 8q24) amplifications were found in any of the cell lines. Two-thirds of the amplification sites took place at loci not associated with established oncogenes, such as 1q41-q43, 7q21-q22, 7q31, 8q23, 9p21-p23, 11p12-p14, 15q12-q14, 16q13-q21, 17q23, 20p11-p12 and 20q13. Several of these locations have not been previously reported and may harbour important genes whose amplification is selected for during cancer development.

Here, we aimed to establish a risk score to allow for prediction of the presence of HER-2 gene status.;A total of 182 HER-2 2+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) invasive breast cancer cases were enrolled in this study. The association between clinicopathological variables like age, sex, tumor grade, hormone receptor (HR) status, P53 and proliferation index (Ki67), and FISH result using US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria was evaluated. Also, we compared the HER-2 FISH results using FDA criteria and 2013 American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) guideline.;The study population had a median age of 48 years (range, 29-78 years). Estrogen receptor (ER) was expressed in 131 (72.0%) patients. 73.1% of patients (133/182) were progesterone receptor (PR) positive. The median Ki67 value was 20% (range, 3-90%). There was good agreement between the FDA and 2013 ASCO/CAP guideline. Sixty-three of all patients were HER-2 FISH amplified (positive) based on FDA criteria. Tumors with HER-2 amplified were more likely to harbor ER negative (58.8% vs. 25.2%, P<0.001) or PR negative (57.1% vs. 26.3%, P<0.001) or P53 negative (44.8% vs. 29.8%, P=0.048). A significant high level of Ki67 was detected in HER-2 amplified groups (P=0.006). We created a risk score that comprised HR, P53 and Ki67.

We describe a patient with inflammatory breast cancer who was initially HER-2/neu negative but became positive after treatment. A 59-year-old postmenopausal white female saw her surgeon for violaceous discoloration of the left breast for 4 months. The surgeon palpated a mass measuring 6 cm in the patient's left breast. Additionally, there was violaceous discoloration involving two thirds of the breast. Biopsy of the breast mass and skin revealed inflammatory breast cancer. The tumor was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor positive and HER-2/neu negative. The patient was given four cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and docetaxol. She subsequently underwent a mastectomy, excision of the skin over the chest wall and axillary node dissection. Of the axillary lymph nodes, 14/14 were involved. The tumor was still estrogen receptor positive and progesterone receptor positive, but HER-2/neu was 2+ by immunohistochemistry and amplified at 3.3 as detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The patient received trastuzumab along with chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy and letrozole. She is currently receiving trastuzumab and letrozole in the adjuvant setting and appears to be doing well.;A breast cancer which was initially HER-2/neu negative can become positive following treatment. Therefore, re-biopsy may be necessary during the course of treatment of breast cancer to re-assess the HER-2/neu status.

The associations of the re-classified combined prognostic markers through recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) of DFS for breast cancer were assessed with the Cox proportional hazard model. The prognostic predictive values of the clinical and genetic models were evaluated by Harrell's C.;In the two-stage GWAS stratified by tumor subtypes, rs166870 and rs10825036 were consistently associated with DFS in the HR+ HER2- and HR- HER2- breast cancer subtypes, respectively (Prs166870 = 2.88 × 10(-7) and Prs10825036 = 3.54 × 10(-7) in the combined set). When patients were classified by the RPA in each subtype, genetic factors contributed significantly to differentiating the high risk group associated with DFS inbreast cancer, specifically the HR+ HER2- (P discovery=1.18 × 10(-8) and P replication = 2.08 × 10(-5)) and HR- HRE2- subtypes (P discovery = 2.35 × 10(-4) and P replication = 2.60 × 10(-2)).

However, the involvement of estrogen signaling in regulation of breast cancer stem/progenitor cells has not been fully established, mainly because expression and function of ER-α in breast cancer stem cells remains controversial. Previously, our laboratory cloned a variant of ER-α, ER-α36, and found that ER-α36-mediated non-genomic estrogen signaling plays an important role in malignant growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells. In this study, we found that ER-α36 was highly expressed in ER-negative breast cancer SK-BR-3 cells and mediated non-genomic estrogen signaling such as activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling in these cells. Knock-down of ER-α36 expression in these cells using the shRNA method diminished their responsiveness to estrogen and significantly down-regulated HER2 expression. HER2 signaling activated ER-α36 transcription through an AP1 site in the ER-α36 promoter and ER-α36 physically interacted with HER2. We also found that ER-α36 is highly expressed in a subset of SK-BR-3 cells that was positive for ALDH1, a breast cancer stem cell marker, and knock-down of ER-α36 expression reduced the population of ALDH1 positive cells. Our results thus demonstrated that ER-α36 positively regulates HER2 expression and the population of ALDH1 positive breast cancer cells, and suggested that non-genomic estrogen signaling mediated by ER-α36 is involved in maintenance and regulation of breast cancer stem cells.",

Synchronous bilateral breast cancers (SBC) was defined as two tumours diagnosed within an interval of 6 months and a second cancer diagnosed after 6 months was labelled as metachronous breast cancer (MBC). Analyses of patient and tumour characteristics were done in this prospective data base of BBC patients.;Median patient age was 66 years (range 39-85). Majority of the patients had SBC (n=28) and in 12 patients the second tumour was clinically occult and detected only by mammography of the contra-lateral breast. The second tumour was found at lower tumour size compared to the first in 73% of cases and was negative for axillary metastasis in 80% of cases (24/30). Infiltrating ductal carcinoma was the commonest histological type (n=51) and majority of the tumours were ER/PR positive (50/60). Her2 was overexpressed in 13 tumours (21%). Over 70% (22/30) of patients had similar histology in both breasts and amongst them grade concordance was present in about 69% (15/22) of patients. Concordance rates of ER, PR and Her2 statuses were 83%, 80% and 90% respectively. Bilateral mastectomy was the commonest surgery performed in 80% of the patients followed by bilateral breast conservation in 13%. At the end of study period, 26 patients were alive and disease free. Median survival was 29 months (range 3-86 months).;In most patients with BBC, the second tumour is identified at an early stage than index tumours supporting the importance of contralateral breast cancer screening at the time of primary diagnosis and during follow-up. BBC occurs more frequently in old age group and majority of these tumours are estrogen dependent.

Around three-quarters of breast cancers express the estrogen receptor and are therefore presumed to be hormone-responsive and potentially treatable or preventable by anti-estrogenic agents. Expression of the HER2 receptor occurs in a fifth of breast cancers and is associated with limited endocrine response in hormone receptor-positive tumours and directs treatment with HER2-targeted agents. Despite improvements in the clinical outcome of breast cancer patients through the development of endocrine and targeted agents, overcoming de novo or acquired resistance remains a considerable therapeutic hurdle. In addition, as our understanding of the complexity of breast cancer biology increases, it is clear that existing therapies will fall short of offering an effective treatment solution to many patients. The ability to profile molecular pathways in drug-responsive and drug-resistant tumours has provided an important step in identifying novel targets in breast cancer.

It is established that treatment with Herceptin leads to selective overexpression and activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Src which further contributes to oncogenesis in Herceptin resistant and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Here, we show a co-regulated upregulation in the expression of Annexin A2 (AnxA2), a known substrate of Src and one of the regulators of EGFR receptor endocytosis, in Herceptin resistant and Her-2 negative breast cancer. Immunohistochemical expression analysis revealed a reciprocal regulation between Her-2 and AnxA2 in breast cancer clinical samples as well as in cell lines as confirmed by protein and RNA analysis. The siRNA and Herceptin mediated downregulation/inhibition of Her-2 in Her-2 amplified cells induced AnxA2 expression and membrane translocation. In this study we report a possible involvement of AnxA2 in maintaining constitutively activated EGFR downstream signaling intermediates and hence in cell proliferation, migration and viability. This effect was consistent in Herceptin resistant JIMT-1 cells as well as in Her-2 negative breast cancer. The siRNA mediated AnxA2 downregulation leads to increased apoptosis, decreased cell viability and migration. Our studies further indicate the role of AnxA2 in EGFR-Src membrane bound signaling complex and ligand induced activation of downstream signaling pathways.

The SLN was evaluated for the presence of tumor cells by hematoxylin-eosin staining and, when negative, by immunocytochemistry using anti-cytokeratin antibody (CAM 5.2). Survival analyses and comparative analyses were performed on the results of bone marrow determinations, SLN biopsy, and known prognostic factors, including breast cancer subtypes according to the simplified classification based on ER, PR and HER2.;Lymph node and hematogenous dissemination occur in one-third of patients with early-stage breast cancer, although not necessarily simultaneously.

Simultaneous lymph node and bone marrow involvement was found in only 5 patients (nonsignificant). In the survival study (60 months), a higher, although nonsignificant rate of disease-related events (13%) was seen in patients with disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow, and a significant association of events was documented with the known, more aggressive tumor subtypes: triple negative receptor status (21%) and positive ERBB2 status (29%).;Tumor cell detection in bone marrow can be considered a valid prognostic parameter in patients with early disease. However, the classic prognostic factors remain highly relevant, and the newer breast cancer subtypes are also useful for this purpose.",

These were also characterized by gene expression analysis and found to represent all five recently described breast cancer subtypes using the \"intrinsic gene set\" and centroid correlation. Three cell lines, HCC1937 and L56BrC1 derived from BRCA1 mutation carriers and MDA-MB-231, were of basal-like subtype and characterized by a high frequency of low-level gains and losses of typical pattern, including limited deletions on 5q. Four estrogen receptor positive cell lines were of luminal A subtype and characterized by a different pattern of aberrations and high-level amplifications, including ERBB2 and other 17q amplicons in BT474 and MDA-MB-361. SK-BR-3 cells, characterized by a complex genome including ERBB2 amplification, massive high-level amplifications on 8q and a homozygous deletion of CDH1 at 16q22, had an expression signature closest to luminal B subtype. The effects of gene amplifications were verified by gene expression analysis to distinguish targeted genes from silent amplicon passengers. JIMT1, derived from an ERBB2 amplified trastuzumab resistant tumor, was of the ERBB2 subtype. Homozygous deletions included other known targets such as PTEN (HCC1937) and CDKN2A (MDA-MB-231, MCF10A), but also new candidate suppressor genes such as FUSSEL18 (HCC1937) and WDR11 (L56Br-C1) as well as regions without known genes.

This study investigated whether increasing SASH1 expression could be a useful therapeutic strategy in breast cancer. Ectopic SASH1 expression increased apoptosis in 7/8 breast cancer cell lines. Subsequent in silico connectivity screening demonstrated that the clinically approved antihistamine drug, chloropyramine, increased SASH1 mRNA levels. Chloropyramine has previously been shown to have anti-tumour activity in breast cancer in part through modulation of FAK signalling, a pathway also regulated by SASH1. This study demonstrated that chloropyramine increased SASH1 protein levels in breast cancer cells. Consistent with this the agent reduced cell confluency in 7/8 cell lines treated irrespective of their ER status but not apoptosis incompetent MCF7 cells. In contrast SASH1 siRNA-transfected breast cancer cells exhibited reduced chloropyramine sensitivity. The prognostic significance of SASH1 expression was also investigated in two breast cancer cohorts. Expression was associated with favourable outcome in ER-positive cases, but only those of low histological grade/proliferative status. Conversely, we found a very strong inverse association in HER2+ disease irrespective of ER status, and in triple-negative, basal-like cases. Overall, the data suggest that SASH1 is prognostic in breast cancer and could have subtype-dependent effects on breast cancer progression. Pharmacologic induction of SASH1 by chloropyramine treatment of breast cancer warrants further preclinical and clinical investigation.",

Rab25 is also frequently silenced in triple-negative breast cancer, suggesting its ability to function as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the breast cancer subtype. However, the pathobiologic role of FIP family members, such as FIP1C, in a tumor-specific setting remains elusive. In this study, we used ErbB2 mouse models of human breast cancer to investigate FIP1C function in tumorigenesis. Doxycycline-induced expression of FIP1C in the MMTV-ErbB2 mouse model resulted in delayed mammary tumor progression. Conversely, targeted deletion of FIP1C in the mammary epithelium of an ErbB2 model coexpressing Cre recombinase led to accelerated tumor onset. Genetic and biochemical characterization of these FIP1C-proficient and -deficient tumor models revealed that FIP1C regulated E-cadherin (CDH1) trafficking and ZONAB (YBX3) function in Cdk4-mediated cell-cycle progression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FIP1C promoted lysosomal degradation of ErbB2. Consistent with our findings in the mouse, the expression of FIP1C was inversely correlated with ErbB2 levels in breast cancer patients. Taken together, our findings indicate that FIP1C acts as a tumor suppressor in the context of ErbB2-positive breast cancer and may be therapeutically exploited as an alternative strategy for targeting aberrant ErbB2 expression.

Increasingly more breast cancer specific targets are imaged such as the estrogen receptor (ER), growth factors and growth factor receptors.

Biologically this cancer subtype is characterized by an aggressive clinical course (often spread to regional lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis), and after successful treatment high risk of recurrence. Deregulation of the cell cycle is the basis for cancer aggressiveness. The RB protein is one of the key regulators of the cell cycle. There are only a few published studies on the expression and localization of RB protein in the cells of HER2-positive breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine whether there are differences in the expression and localization of RB protein in HER2-positive breast cancers compared to breast cancers showing no expression of HER2. We used 50 tissue samples from HER2 positive breast cancer and 21 tissue samples derived from patients with HER2 negative breast cancer. The RB protein expression was measured by immunohistochemical techniques in tissue microarray format. Cytoplasmic RB expression was observed in 29 out of 50 (58%) HER2 positive breast cancers. In this group only cytoplasmic expression was observed. There was no case with nuclear expression. In contrast, in the HER2-negative breast cancer control group, in no case RB expression was observed in the cytoplasm (0/21, 0%). All 21 samples (100%) showed expression of RB protein in the nucleus (p < 0.0001). We can speculate that lack of expression suggests alternative mechanisms in the development of HER2 positive breast cancer.

While early-onset breast cancers largely represent inherited or early life transforming effects on immature mammary epithelium, late-onset breast cancers likely follow extended exposures to promoting stimuli of susceptible epithelium that has failed to age normally. Among stimuli thought to promote late-onset breast tumorigenesis are the altered extracellular matrix and secreted products of senescent fibroblasts; however, the extent to which these senescent influences exist within the aging breast remains unknown. Clinical observations and biomarker studies indicate that late-onset breast cancers grow more slowly and are biologically less aggressive than early-onset breast cancers, even when controlled for hormone receptor (e.g. estrogen receptor, ER) and growth factor receptor (e.g. HER2) expression, supporting the conclusion that the biology of breast cancer is age-dependent.",

The cell lines also were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) by 2 centers using HER-2/neu kits. FISH produced 100% agreement between the 2 centers: SKOV-3 and MDA-MB-453 showed HER-2/neu amplification and BT-20 and MCF-7 did not. Immunohistochemical analysis and a common evaluation method produced 100% agreement that SKOV-3 and MCF-7 showed 3+ and zero HER-2/neu overexpression, respectively. For MDA-MB-453, there was 71% (5/7) concordance of 2+ immunohistochemical staining and 86% (6/7) concordance of zero or 1 + staining for BT-20.

It is well tolerated and improves overall survival and time-to-disease progression; with chemotherapy, it is part of the standard of care for patients with HER2+ metastatic disease. However, many patients do not benefit from it because of resistance. Substantial research has been performed to understand the mechanism of trastuzumab resistance and develop combination strategies to overcome the resistance. In this review, we provide insight into the current pipeline of drugs used in combination with trastuzumab and the degree to which these combinations have been evaluated, especially in patients who have experienced disease progression on trastuzumab.

We studied all the T1N0M0 breast cancers that had led to recurrency or death (n=21, 95% T1cN0M0) during the follow-up period (4-14 years). The study is based on statistical analyses of matched case-control data in which the prognostic factors of each individual patient with aggressive disease were compared with control patients (n=45) individually matched by tumour size, age at diagnosis, histological type of tumour and length of follow-up. The cancer cases were examined for clinically applicable conventional and immunohistochemical pathologic prognostic factors. High Ki-67 immunopositivity was the strongest prognosticator of breast cancer death or recurrence in T1N0M0 breast cancer. Also, high p53 immunopositivity, low oestrogen receptor immunopositivity and Her-2/neu oncogene amplification by chromogen in situ hybridisation were reliable indicators of unfavourable outcome. Our statistical methods also allowed us to determine for the present material a range of clinical significance for each immunohistochemical prognostic feature with the associated relative risk for breast cancer death and recurrence.

Little is known about their role in the different breast cancer (BC) phenotypes. We carried out microarray phosphatome profiling in 41 estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) BC patients, as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), containing both ERBB2+ and ERBB2- in order to characterize the differences between these two groups. We characterized and confirmed the distinct phosphatome of the two main ER- BC subgroups (in two independent microarrays series) and that of ER+ BC (in three large independent series). Our findings point to the importance of the MAPK and PI3K pathways in ER- BCs as some of the most differentially expressed phosphatases (like DUSP4 and DUSP6) sharing ERK as substrate, or regulating the PI3K pathway (INPP4B, PTEN). It was possible to identify a selective group of phosphatases upregulated only in the ER- ERBB2+ subgroup and not in ER+ (like DUSP6, DUSP10 and PPAPDC1A among others), suggesting a role of these phosphatases in specific BC subtypes, unlike other differentially expressed phosphatases (DUSP4 and ENPP1) that seemed to have a role in multiple BC subtypes. Significant correlation was found at the protein level by IHC between the expression of DUSP6 and phospho-ERK (p=0.04) but not of phospho-ERK with DUSP4. To show the potential prognostic relevance of phosphatases as a functional group of genes, we derived and validated in two large independent BC microarray series a multiphosphatase signature enriched in differentially expressed phosphatases, to predict distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). ER- ERBB2+, ER- ERBB2- and ER+ BC patients have a distinct pattern of phosphatase RNA expression with a potential prognostic relevance.

The relatively weak correlation between HER2 status and response to HER2-targeting drugs suggests that measurement of HER2 signaling activity, rather than absolute HER2 levels, may more accurately diagnose HER2-driven breast cancer. A new diagnostic test, the CELx HER2 Signaling Profile (CELx HSP) test, is demonstrated to measure real-time HER2 signaling function in live primary cells. In the present study, epithelial cells extracted fresh from breast cancer patient tumors classified as HER2 negative (HER2-, n = 34 of which 33 were estrogen receptor positive) and healthy subjects (n = 16) were evaluated along with reference breast cancer cell lines (n = 19). Live cell response to specific HER2 agonists (NRG1b and EGF) and antagonist (pertuzumab) was measured. Of the HER2- breast tumor cell samples tested, 7 of 34 patients (20.5%; 95% CI = 10%-37%) had HER2 signaling activity that was characterized as abnormally high. Amongst the tumor samples there was no correlation between HER2 protein status (by cell cytometry) and HER2 signaling activity (hyperactive or normal) (Regression analysis P = 0.144, R2 = 0.068). One conclusion is that measurement of HER2 signaling activity can identify a subset of breast cancers with normal HER2 receptor levels with abnormally high levels of HER2 signaling.

In addition, the transcripts of CYP19 were analysed for alternative splicing/usage of exon 1 and an alternative poly A tail.;A great variability of expression was observed, ranging from 0 to 2376 amol/mg RNA. The highest levels were observed for STS and EST, and the lowest levels (close to zero) were observed for the 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoenzymes. The levels of mRNA expression were analysed with respect to clinical and histopathological parameters as well as for disease-free survival. High correlation of the mRNA expression of STS, EST and 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the tumours suggested a common regulation, possibly by their common metabolite (oestradiol). Hierarchical clustering analysis in the 155 patients resulted in two main clusters, representing the ERalpha-negative and ERalpha-positive breast cancer cases. The mRNA expression of the oestradiol metabolising enzymes did not follow the expression of the ERalpha in all cases, leading to the formation of several subclasses of tumours. Patients with no expression of CYP19 and patients with high levels of expression of STS had significantly shorter disease-free survival time (P > 0.0005 and P < 0.03, respectively).

We find that the majority of the Paget disease of the breast demonstrate HER-2 gene amplification, whereas most of the extramammary Paget disease lack HER-2 gene amplification. In addition, our results show a good correlation between HER-2/neu protein overexpression and HER-2 gene amplification in Paget disease of the nipple, but we were unable to confirm this correlation in HER-2/neu protein overexpressing Paget disease of the vulva.",

The human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is overexpressed in approximately 30% of breast cancers and this is associated with poor clinical outcome. Overexpression of HER2 has been demonstrated to play a direct role in oncogenic transformation. Murine monoclonal antibodies (muMAbs) targeting the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptors suppress HER2-positive cancer cell growth, with muMAb 4D5 having particularly potent activity. A humanized form of muMAb 4D5 was generated by converting all but the antigen-binding region of muMAb 4D5 into human IgG consensus sequences. The humanized monoclonal antibody, Herceptin, preferentially targets HER2-overexpressing cells, produces responses in breast cancer patients and is well tolerated. In a pivotal phase III trial, Herceptin administered in combination with chemotherapy (anthracycline/cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel) was compared with chemotherapy alone. The combination was found to produce significant survival benefits in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients.

Controversy exists not only on the optimal method of laboratory testing for this HER-2/neu alteration (i.e., fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) versus immunohistochemistry (IHC) versus others), but also on the type of reagents used for a given method. A plethora of published studies on tissue-based HER-2/neu testing has recently appeared in many peer-reviewed journals; many have concluded that IHC could be used as a first-line screening test, with the recommendation of FISH to confirm indeterminate results. In contrast to these studies, a recent study by Pauletti et al. showed that HER-2/neu testing by IHC does not predict clinical outcome as accurately as does FISH.

Breast cancer subtypes were classified using tumor biomarkers for hormone receptor (HR) and human growth factor-neu receptor (HER2) expression.;Overall cancer incidence decreased for men by 1.8% annually from 2007 to 2011 [corrected]. Rates for women were stable from 1998 to 2011. Within these trends there was racial/ethnic variation, and some sites have increasing rates. Among children, incidence rates continued to increase by 0.8% per year over the past decade while, like adults, mortality declined. HR+/HER2- breast cancers, the subtype with the best prognosis, were the most common for all races/ethnicities with highest rates among non-Hispanic white women, local stage cases, and low poverty areas (92.7, 63.51, and 98.69 per 100000 non-Hispanic white women, respectively). HR+/HER2- breast cancer incidence rates were strongly, positively correlated with mammography use, particularly for non-Hispanic white women (Pearson 0.57, two-sided P < .001). Triple-negative breast cancers, the subtype with the worst prognosis, were highest among non-Hispanic black women (27.2 per 100000 non-Hispanic black women), which is reflected in high rates in southeastern states.;Progress continues in reducing the burden of cancer in the United States. There are unique racial/ethnic-specific incidence patterns for breast cancer subtypes; likely because of both biologic and social risk factors, including variation in mammography use.

The prognostic impact of HER2 positivity is lower in node-negative compared with node-positive women. The only significant, independent prognostic factors in breast cancer are node status, HER2 status and menopausal status. HER2-positive tumors also contain p53 abnormalities, tend to be hormone receptor and bcl-2 negative, have lymphoid infiltration (LI) and a high mitotic index. Patients with LI who are HER2 positive have a better prognosis than those who are HER2 negative, whereas HER2-positive patients without LI have a significantly worse prognosis than HER2-negative patients. Morphological and biological alterations appear to identify two categories of breast tumor. Two hypotheses may explain the progression to two tumor types: (1) atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) is a precursor of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which is a precursor of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC); or (2) ADH is a precursor of HER2-negative IDC whereas DCIS is a precursor of HER2-positive IDC. The second theory fits well with two breast cancer subsets and the characteristics of ADH and DCIS. The first type of IDC occurs in older patients, progresses slowly due to estrogen dependency but is aggressive long term. The other type progresses rapidly, is HER2 positive and is more likely to occur in young patients.",

Breast cancer is divided in three major subtypes based on the pattern of expression of hormone receptors and HER2: luminal tumors (or HR positive), HER2 amplified tumors, and the remaining subtypes being collectively referred to as triple-negative breast cancer. While tumors within these subtypes have similar gene-expression patterns, clinical outcomes, and response to therapy, this division is far from perfect and subgroups within these groups are beginning to be identified. In terms of therapy, an increasingly rational drug development effort has resulted in agents against new molecular targets that are active against only those tumors with the targeted molecular alteration or phenotype. These agents include receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (HER1, HER2, HER3, insulin-like growth factor receptor, c-met, fibroblast growth factor receptor and HSP 90 inhibitors), intracellular signaling pathways (PI3K, AKT, mTOR), angiogenesis inhibitors and agents that interfere with DNA repair (PARP inhibitors). Thus, the overall management of breast cancer will increasingly require an understanding of breast cancer heterogeneicity, the biological nature of any given tumor as well the existence of increased personalized treatment options.",

A total of 428 women diagnosed with breast cancer from 2002 to 2011 were included and categorized into four molecular subtypes using immunohistochemistry. Prevalence of each subtype and its association with patients' demographics and tumor characteristics, such as size, grade, lymph-node involvement and vascular invasion, were investigated using Chi-square, analysis of variance and multivariate logistic regression. Luminal A was the most common molecular subtype (63.8%) followed by Luminal B (8.4%), basal-like (15.9%) and HER-2 (11.9%). Basal-like and HER-2 subtypes were mostly of higher grades while luminal A tumors were more of grade 1 (P<0.001). Vascular invasion was more prevalent in HER-2 subtype, and HER-2 positive tumors were significantly associated with vascular invasion (P=0.013). Using muti-variate analysis, tumor size greater than 5 cm and vascular invasion were significant predictors of 3 or more nodal metastases. Breast cancer was most commonly diagnosed in women around 50 years of age and the majority of patients had lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis. This points to the necessity for devising an efficient screening program for breast cancer in Iran.

However, a significant proportion of HER2-positive patients are either inherently resistant or develop resistance to trastuzumab. We assessed the effects of neratinib, an irreversible panHER inhibitor, in a panel of 36 breast cancer cell lines. We further assessed its effects with or without trastuzumab in several sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells as well as a BT474 xenograft model. We confirmed that neratinib was significantly more active in HER2-amplified than HER2 non-amplified cell lines. Neratinib decreased the activation of the 4 HER receptors and inhibited downstream pathways. However, HER3 and Akt were reactivated at 24 hours, which was prevented by the combination of trastuzumab and neratinib. Neratinib also decreased pHER2 and pHER3 in acquired trastuzumab resistant cells. Neratinib in combination with trastuzumab had a greater growth inhibitory effect than either drug alone in 4 HER2 positive cell lines. Furthermore, trastuzumab in combination with neratinib was growth inhibitory in SKBR3 and BT474 cells which had acquired resistance to trastuzumab as well as in a BT474 xenograft model. Innately trastuzumab resistant cell lines showed sensitivity to neratinib, but the combination did not enhance response compared to neratinib alone. Levels of HER2 and phospho-HER2 showed a direct correlation with sensitivity to neratinib. Our data indicate that neratinib is an effective anti-HER2 therapy and counteracted both innate and acquired trastuzumab resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer. Our results suggest that combined treatment with trastuzumab and neratinib is likely to be more effective than either treatment alone for both trastuzumab-sensitive breast cancer as well as HER2-positive tumors with acquired resistance to trastuzumab.

Early diagnosis, prognosis and therapy plays crucial role in the survival of patients with breast cancer. The study was aimed on identification of potential markers for early BC diagnostics by means of genome-wide comparative analysis of gene expression in cancer and normal tissue of breast.;The analysis of gene expression in 15 invasive adenocarcinoma specimens and 15 normal breast tissue was conducted using the full-genome microarrays Sentrix HumanWD-6V3 BeadChip (Illumina). Methylation of TP53INK1 and TUSС5 promoters was interrogated by the combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA).;Analysis of gene expression in the samples of breast adenocarcinoma revealed abnormal expression of more than 2,300 genes. While genes TFF1, S100P, ERBB2, TOP2A, CDF15, HOOK1, DNAJC12, CORO2A were up-regulated in cancer, decreased expression was found for genes TUSC5, SFRP1, PPPQR1B, NTRK4, TIMP4, BARD1, AKR1C2, TP53INK1 and others. Analysis of DNA methylation of TUSC5 by COBRA revealed higher levels of exon 1 methylation (11/12) in samples of breast cancer, whereas the gene was essentially unmethylated in matched normal appearing tissue of breast (2/12). TP53INK1 gene was methylated neither in cancer nor in normalcy.;A total of 149 genes exhibited the highest difference in expression in cancer versus normal appearing tissue of breast. Most prominent down-regulated candidates, TUSC5 and TP53INK1, were reported for the first time in breast cancer and may be considered as potential markers of the disease.

Although various therapeutic options were introduced into the clinic in recent decades, with the objective of improving surgery, radiotherapy, biochemotherapy and chemotherapy, varying response of individual patients to certain types of therapy and therapy resistance is still a challenge in breast cancer care. Therefore, since breast cancer treatment should be based on individual features of the patient and her tumor, tailored therapy should be an option by integrating cancer biomarkers to define patients at risk and to reliably predict their course of the disease and/or response to cancer therapy. Recently, candidate-marker approaches and genome-wide transcriptomic and epigenetic screening of different breast cancer tissues and bodily fluids resulted in new promising biomarker panels, allowing breast cancer prognosis, prediction of therapy response and monitoring of therapy efficacy.

The purpose of this study was to explore if the expression of FOXA1 and GATA-3 may provide an opportunity to stratify subsets of patients that could have better outcome, among the ERalpha-negative/poor prognosis breast cancer group.;We evaluate FOXA1 and GATA-3 expression in 249 breast carcinomas by immunohistochemistry, associating it with breast cancer molecular markers, clinicopathological features and patient's survival. The clinicopathological features and immunohistochemical markers of the tumours were compared using the chi-square test and ANOVA. Disease-free survival was analysed through Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression.;FOXA1 expression was demonstrated in 42% of invasive carcinomas, while GATA-3 was detected in 48% of the cases. FOXA1 expression was inversely associated with tumour size, Nottingham Prognostic Index, histological grade, lymph vascular invasion, lymph node stage and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) overexpression, while GATA-3 expression showed inverse association with histological grade and HER-2. Both FOXA1 and GATA-3 were directly associated with ERalpha and progesterone receptor. Among FOXA1-positive tumours, 83.1% are comprised in the luminal A subtype, similar to GATA-3 where 87.7% of positive tumours were classified within this molecular subtype. In the subset of ERalpha-negative patients, those who were FOXA1-negative had a 3.61-fold increased risk of breast cancer recurrence when compared with the FOXA1-positive.;FOXA1 was a significant predictor of good outcome in breast cancer, whereas GATA-3 was an important luminal marker.

Overexpression of p95HER2 is one of the molecular mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether p95HER2 overexpressing breast cancers were resistant to trastuzumab.;p95HER2 (truncated HER2) and HER2 were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. HER2 protein expression and HER2 gene amplification were also determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH). Archival material from 80 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast cancer tumor tissues was used for the study. None of the cases had metastases at the initial diagnosis. HER2-positive cases were treated with trastuzumab with/without chemotherapy.;Of 80 breast cancer cases 39 (48.7%) were HER2-positive and had trastuzumab treatment.

If p95HER2 ratio was low, there was no trastuzumab resistance. However, when p95HER2 ratio was high, there was trastuzumab resistance (p=0.210, Mann-Whitney U test).;p95HER2 was correlated with trastuzumab resistance, but it was not an independent factor of trastuzumab resistance.

Patient-related factors such as young age at diagnosis, obesity, and smoking behaviour may also modify disease outcome. Due to the absence of a unique definition for \"young age breast cancer\" and the resulting variation in disease management, findings on the association between young age and prognosis of breast cancer are controversial. Methods. This study included 1500 patients with a primary diagnosis of breast cancer in six Iranian hospitals from 5 provinces. We modelled the relative excess risk (RER) of breast cancer death to age at diagnosis and tumour characteristics. Results. Excess risks of death were observed for stage IV disease and poorly differentiated tumours: RER of 4.3 (95% CI: 1.05-17.65) and 3.4 (95% CI: 1.17-9.87), respectively. \"Older\" patients, particularly those aged 50 and over, presented more often with advanced and poorly differentiated tumours (P = 0.001). After adjustment for stage, histological grade, Her-2 expression, estrogen and progesterone receptors, and place of residency, breast cancer mortality was not significantly different across age groups.

The Task Force is a multidisciplinary panel of 24 experts in breast cancer representing the disciplines of medical oncology, pathology, radiation oncology, surgical oncology, epidemiology, and patient advocacy. Invited members included members of the NCCN Breast Cancer Panel and other needed experts selected solely by the NCCN. During a 2-day meeting, individual task force members provided didactic presentations critically evaluating important aspects of HER2 biology and epidemiology: HER2 as a prognostic and predictive factor; results from clinical trials in which trastuzumab was used as a targeted therapy against HER2 in the adjuvant and metastatic settings; the available testing methodologies for HER2, including sensitivity, specificity, and ability to provide prognostic and predictive information; and the principles on which HER2 testing should be based. Each task force member was charged with identifying evidence relevant to their specific expertise and presentation. Following the presentations, an evidence-based consensus approach was used to formulate recommendations relating to the pathologic and clinical application of the evidence to breast cancer patient evaluation and care. In areas of controversy, this process extended beyond the meeting to achieve consensus. The Task Force concluded that accurate assignment of the HER2 status of invasive breast cancer is essential to clinical decision making in the treatment of breast cancer in both adjuvant and metastatic settings. Formal validation and concordance testing should be performed and reported by laboratories performing HER2 testing for clinical purposes. If appropriate quality control/assurance procedures are in place, either immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methods may be used. A tumor with an IHC score of 0 or 1+, an average HER2 gene/chromosome 17 ratio of less than 1.8, or an average number of HER2 gene copies/cell of 4 or less as determined by FISH is considered to be HER2 negative. A tumor with an IHC score of 3+, an average HER2 gene/chromosome 17 ratio of greater than 2.2 by FISH, or an average number of HER2 gene copies/cell of 6 or greater is considered HER2 positive. A tumor with an IHC score of 2+ should be further tested using FISH, with HER2 status determined by the FISH result. Tumor samples with an average HER2 gene/chromosome ratio of 1.8 to 2.2 or average number of HER2 gene copies/cell in the range of greater than 4 to less than 6 are considered to be borderline, and strategies to assign the HER2 status of such samples are proposed.",

Receptor characteristics could be altered with time and may be affected by anticancer treatment. It remains uncertain whether recurrences have the identical or similar HER2 receptor expression pattern as the primary breast cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether HER2 is stable during the process of recurrence. Expression of HER2 was investigated immunohistochemically in paired samples of primary breast cancers and corresponding asynchronous local-regional recurrences (n=35). HER2 expression was scored as 0, 1+, 2+ or 3+. HER2 overexpression (2+ or 3+) was found in 48.57% (17/35) of the primary breast cancers and 45.71% (16/35) of the corresponding local-regional recurrences. A concordance of HER2 overexpression between the primary lesions and matching regional recurrences was observed in 85.71% of the breast cancer cases. Five out of the 35 paired samples (14.28%) were discordant. Only 3 patients who had 2+ HER2 expression in the primary tumors showed HER2 down-regulation (0 or 1+) in the recurrences, while the HER2 score in 2 patients changed oppositely. Moreover, all of the cases with 3+ HER2 staining in the primary lesions retained HER2 overexpression in the recurrences. The HER2 is commonly expressed in breast cancer, and its expression in the primary tumors and the corresponding recurrences was concordant in the majority of the cases. As the receptor expression may lose or gain in recurrences at a probability of approximately 10%, assessment of the receptor status in recurrences is still encouraged.",

Pertuzumab, another humanized monoclonal antibody, binds to a different domain of HER2 and prevents the formation of HER2:HER3 dimers, which is the most potent heterodimer in the HER family. The combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab has synergistic activity, and is associated with improved clinical outcomes. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab-based chemotherapy originally as first-line therapy for metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer in 2012, and more recently as neoadjuvant therapy for localized disease in 2013. Pertuzumab is the first neoadjuvant drug to receive accelerated approval by the FDA based on pathological complete response as the primary end point. In this article, we review the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, and current role of pertuzumab in the management of breast cancer, as well as ongoing clinical trials and future directions regarding the utility of pertuzumab as a personalized therapeutic option for HER2-positive breast cancer. In the coming years, we anticipate increased utilization of neoadjuvant trials for drug development, biomarker discovery, and validation, and envision conduct of personalized breast cancer clinics in which therapies will be routinely selected based on genetic alterations in the tumor. Regardless of the targeted therapy combinations employed based on tumor genomic profile, trastuzumab and pertuzumab will likely continue to form the backbone of the personalized regimen for HER2-positive breast cancer.

The aim of our study was to identify antigens eliciting a humoral immune response in HER2+ and HER2- NP breast cancers by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2D), Western blotting, and mass spectrometry. Sera from 18 women with newly diagnosed NP breast cancer (9 HER2+ and 9 HER2-) and 9 healthy volunteers were individually investigated for the presence of antibodies to MCF7 breast cancer cell line proteome. Reactive spots in 2D blots were matched to stained 2D gels. Twenty-eight of matched spots were identified by mass spectrometry. Among them were LDH-A, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase-α, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, proteasome 26S non-ATPase subunit 13, triosephosphate isomerase, hnRNP K, hsp27, hsp90, prohibitin, nucleophosmin, 14-3-3ɛ, PP2A regulatory subunit, and ribonuclease inhibitor-angiogenin. The five former antigens were more commonly reacted with sera from HER2+ cases, and the three latter antigens were more commonly reacted with sera from HER2- cases. Noteworthy, the antigenicity of the 28 spots showed a few differences when SBR3 cell line was used as the source of antigens. Although some of the identified antigens were previously defined as tumor antigens, others were novel.

Patients with luminal breast cancers are often associated with a better prognosis relative to that with other subtypes. However, subsets of patients with luminal disease remain at increased risk of cancer-related death. A critical process that increases the malignant potential of breast cancers is the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The p66ShcA adaptor protein stimulates the formation of reactive oxygen species in response to stress stimuli. In this paper, we report a novel role for p66ShcA in inducing an EMT in HER2(+) luminal breast cancers. p66ShcA increases the migratory properties of breast cancer cells and enhances signaling downstream of the Met receptor tyrosine kinase in these tumors. Moreover, Met activation is required for a p66ShcA-induced EMT in luminal breast cancer cells. Finally, elevated p66ShcA levels are associated with the acquisition of an EMT in primary breast cancers spanning all molecular subtypes, including luminal tumors. This is of high clinical relevance, as the luminal and HER2 subtypes together comprise 80% of all newly diagnosed breast cancers. This study identifies p66ShcA as one of the first prognostic biomarkers for the identification of more aggressive tumors with mesenchymal properties, regardless of molecular subtype. ",

Breast cancer patients who initially respond to lapatinib may eventually manifest acquired resistance to this treatment. Thus, the identification of novel agents that may prevent or delay the development of acquired resistance to lapatinib is critical. In the current study, we show that the combination of lapatinib and bortezomib results in a synergistic growth inhibition in human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing breast cancer cells and that the combination enhances apoptosis of SK-BR-3 cells. Importantly, we found that the combination of lapatinib plus bortezomib more effectively blocked activation of the HER2 pathway in SK-BR-3 cells, compared with monotherapy. In addition, we established a model of acquired resistance to lapatinib by chronically challenging SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells with increasing concentrations of lapatinib. Here, we showed that bortezomib notably induced apoptosis of lapatinib-resistant SK-BR-3 pools and further inhibited HER2 signaling in the resistant cells. Taken together, the current data indicate a synergistic interaction between lapatinib and bortezomib in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells and provide the rationale for the clinical evaluation of these two noncross-resistant targeted therapies.

However, primary and acquired resistance to trastuzumab remains a significant problem. Pertuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to a domain of the HER2 receptor separate from trastuzumab, may have the potential to overcome trastuzumab resistance. Clinical trials have shown that pertuzumab can be effectively combined with other biologic therapy or chemotherapy in patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Pertuzumab is relatively well tolerated with minimal increases in hematologic and cardiac toxicity observed when added to trastuzumab and/or docetaxel. In addition to becoming the standard of care in combination with docetaxel and trastuzumab in patients with newly diagnosed HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, clinical trials continue to evaluate pertuzumab in combination with other targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and in patients with early stage breast cancer. These trials will help to further determine the role of pertuzumab in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. ",

Although gene expression profiles have been used to predict the risks and prognostic outcomes of breast cancers, the high variability of gene expression limits its clinical application. In contrast, genetic mutation profiles would be more advantageous than gene expression profiles because genetic mutations can be stably detected and the mutational heterogeneity widely exists in breast cancer genomes. We analyzed 98 breast cancer whole exome samples that were sorted into three subtypes, two grades and two stages. The sum deleterious effect of all mutations in each gene was scored to identify differentially mutated genes (DMGs) for this case-control study. DMGs were corroborated using extensive published knowledge. Functional consequences of deleterious SNVs on protein structure and function were also investigated. Genes such as ERBB2, ESP8, PPP2R4, KIAA0922, SP4, CENPJ, PRCP and SELP that have been experimentally or clinically verified to be tightly associated with breast cancer prognosis are among the DMGs identified in this study. We also identified some genes such as ARL6IP5, RAET1E, and ANO7 that could be crucial for breast cancer development and prognosis. Further, SNVs such as rs1058808, rs2480452, rs61751507, rs79167802, rs11540666, and rs2229437 that potentially influence protein functions are observed at significantly different frequencies in different comparison groups. Protein structure modeling revealed that many non-synonymous SNVs have a deleterious effect on protein stability, structure and function. Mutational profiling at gene- and SNV-level revealed differential patterns within each breast cancer comparison group, and the gene signatures correlate with expected prognostic characteristics of breast cancer classes. Some of the genes and SNVs identified in this study show high promise and are worthy of further investigation by experimental studies. ",

By 1998, antibody therapy targeting the HER2 pathway was shown to demonstrably improve progression-free and overall survival in metastatic disease, and in 2005 evidence of improvement in disease-free and overall survival from the first generation of trastuzumab adjuvant trials became available. However, not all patients with HER2 overexpression benefit from trastuzumab. Second-generation studies in metastatic disease led to the approval of several new HER2-targeted therapies using small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as lapatinib, new HER2/HER3 antibodies such as pertuzumab, and the new antibody chemotherapy conjugate ado-trastuzumab emtansine. These successes supported the launch of second-generation adjuvant trials testing single and dual HER2-targeted agents, administered concomitantly or sequentially with chemotherapy that will soon complete accrual. HER2-positive breast cancer in the setting of HER2-targeted therapy is no longer associated with poor prognosis, and recent guidance by the US Food and Drug Administration suggests that pathologic response to HER2-targeted therapy given preoperatively may allow an earlier assessment of their clinical benefit in the adjuvant setting. An adjuvant trial of trastuzumab in patient whose tumors express normal levels of HER2 and trials of single/dual HER2-targeting without chemotherapy are also ongoing.

We previously reported activation of NF-kappaB in ER-negative breast cancer cells and breast tumor specimens, but the consequence of inhibiting NF-kappaB activation in this subclass of breast cancer has not been shown. In this study, we investigated the role of NF-kappaB activation by studying the tumorigenic potential of cells expressing genetically manipulated, inducible, dominant-negative inhibitory kappaB kinase (IKK) beta in xenograft tumor model. Conditional inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by the inducible expression of dominant-negative IKKbeta simultaneously blocked cell proliferation, reinstated apoptosis, and dramatically blocked xenograft tumor formation. Secondly, the humanized anti-erbB2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) and the specific IKK inhibitor NF-kappaB essential modifier-binding domain peptide both blocked NF-kappaB activation and cell proliferation and reinstated apoptosis in two ER-negative and erbB2-positive human breast cancer cell lines that are used as representative model systems. Combinations of these two target-specific inhibitors synergistically blocked cell proliferation at concentrations that were singly ineffective. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activation with two other low molecular weight compounds, PS1145 and PS341, which inhibited IKK activity and proteasome-mediated phosphorylated inhibitory kappaB protein degradation, respectively, blocked erbB2-mediated cell growth and reversed antiapoptotic machinery. These results implicate NF-kappaB activation in the tumorigenesis and progression of ER-negative breast cancer. It is postulated that this transcription factor and its activation cascade offer therapeutic targets for erbB2-positive and ER-negative breast cancer.",

We focused our investigation in elucidating the molecular mechanism(s) by which I3C induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Our data show that I3C inhibits breast cancer cell growth in a dose dependent manner in Her-2/neu over-expressing and in normal Her-2/neu expressing cells. Induction of apoptosis was also observed in these cell lines when treated with I3C, as measured by poly (ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 activation. In addition, we found that I3C up-regulates Bax, down-regulates Bcl-2 and, thereby, increased the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 favoring apoptosis. These results suggest that the alteration in the expression of these genes may play an important role in mediating the biological effects of I3C. Moreover, we also show the cellular localization of Bax by confocal microscopy, which showed diffuse distribution of Bax throughout the cytoplasmic compartment in breast cancer cells in control culture. However, in I3C treated cells, Bax showed a punctate pattern of distribution that was localized in the mitochondria. From these results, we conclude that the over-expression and translocation of Bax to mitochondria causes mitochondrial depolarization and activation of caspases, which may be one of the mechanism(s) by which I3C induces apoptotic processes in I3C treated breast cancer cells. Overall, our present data provide a novel molecular mechanism(s) by which I3C elicits its biological effects on both Her-2/neu over-expressing and with normal Her-2/neu expressing breast cancer cells, suggesting that I3C could be an effective agent in inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells.",

We analyzed 1432 stage I-III breast cancer patients who had undergone surgery at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital between June 2003 and August 2011. Five subtypes were defined according to estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and Ki-67. Overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-free interval (BCFI) rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Site-specific recurrence was estimated using Gray's test. The median follow-up period was 53 months. There were 22 local recurrences, 18 cases of contralateral breast cancer, 19 regional nodal recurrences, and 70 distant metastases. The 5-year BCFIs by subtype were luminal B-HER2 (+), 94.2 %; luminal A, 93.9 %; luminal B-HER2 (-), 91.4 %; HER2, 83.1 %; and triple-negative, 81.9 % (p < 0.001). Cases with the luminal A had a 5-year OS rate of 98.3 % that was the longest compared to those of cases with luminal B-HER2 (-), 95.8 %; luminal B-HER2 (+), 98.0 %; HER2, 90.8 %; and triple-negative, 89.9 % (p < 0.001). The triple-negative had a higher rate of local recurrence at the first site than others (p = 0.013). HER2 and triple-negative had higher rates of nodal recurrence at the first site than others (p < 0.001). The outcomes and patterns of site-specific recurrence in Korean breast cancer patients were different for each subtype. Defining recurrence patterns by breast cancer subtypes can help determine the appropriate method of surveillance and treatment. ",

Median age was 65 years (range: 25-87 years). Estrogen receptors were positive in 88 patients (96.7%), and progesterone receptors were positive in 84 patients (92.3%). HER-2 was overexpressed in 13 of 85 patients (16%). Median follow-up was 51.5 months (range: 0.5-219.3 months). Five-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 50%, whereas overall survival (OS) was 68.1%. Patients with grades 1 and 2 presented 5-year PFS of 71% versus 22.5% for patients with grade 3 disease; 5-year OS was 85.7% for patients with grades 1 and 2 versus 53.3% of patients with grade 3. Ki-67 score >20% and adjuvant chemotherapy were also statistically significant for OS on univariate analyses. Twenty-six of 87 patients (29.8%) experienced recurrent disease and 16 of 91 patients (17.6%) developed a second neoplasia.;Male breast cancer shows different biological patterns compared with FBC, with higher positive hormone-receptor status and lower HER-2 overexpression. Grade 3 and Ki-67 >20% were associated with shorter OS.;There is little evidence that prognostic features established in female breast cancer, such as grading and Ki-67 labeling index, could be applied to male breast cancer as well.

Many questions remain regarding the impact of HER-2 positivity on survival and treatment with adjuvant anti-HER-2 therapy. Regarding metastatic male breast cancer, the results suggest that common regimens of chemo-, endocrine and immunotherapy used in female breast cancer are safe and effective for men.

We have characterized the role of miRNAs in regulating the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-pathway in breast cancer. We performed miRNA gain-of-function assays by screening two HER2 amplified cell lines (KPL-4 and JIMT-1) with a miRNA mimic library consisting of 810 human miRNAs. The levels of HER2, phospho-AKT, phospho-ERK1/2, cell proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis (cPARP) were analyzed with reverse-phase protein arrays. Rank product analyses identified 38 miRNAs (q < 0.05) as inhibitors of HER2 signaling and cell growth, the most effective being miR-491-5p, miR-634, miR-637 and miR-342-5p. We also characterized miRNAs directly targeting HER2 and identified seven novel miRNAs (miR-552, miR-541, miR-193a-5p, miR-453, miR-134, miR-498, and miR-331-3p) as direct regulators of the HER2 3'UTR. We demonstrated the clinical relevance of the miRNAs and identified miR-342-5p and miR-744* as significantly down-regulated in HER2-positive breast tumors as compared to HER2-negative tumors from two cohorts of breast cancer patients (101 and 1302 cases). miR-342-5p specifically inhibited HER2-positive cell growth, as it had no effect on the growth of HER2-negative control cells in vitro. Furthermore, higher expression of miR-342-5p was associated with better survival in both breast cancer patient cohorts. In conclusion, we have identified miRNAs which are efficient negative regulators of the HER2 pathway that may play a role in vivo during breast cancer progression. These results give mechanistic insights in HER2 regulation which may open potential new strategies towards prevention and therapeutic inhibition of HER2-positive breast cancer. ",

ER, PR and HER2 expression was detected in 75.7%, 73.2% and 19.9% of tumors, respectively. Although increased tumor size and grade, ER and PR negativity and HER2 positivity were strong indicators of ALN metastasis on univariate analyses, only tumor size and HER2 expression were independent predictors of ALN involvement on multivariate analysis. ROC curve showed a strong validity of the model using these two parameters to predict ALN status (AUC 0.86; p<0001). HER2-rich, luminal B and triple negative tumors had 6.87, 6.32 and 3.58 times increased risk of metastasis compared to luminal A tumors; respectively. HER2 expression in pT1 and pT2 tumors raised the risk of ALN metastasis by 7.7 and 7.6 times, respectively and grade 1 and 2 tumors that expressed HER2 were 16.0 and 7.8 times more likely to have ALN metastasis, respectively.

We have previously demonstrated that p130Cas adaptor is a crucial mediator of ErbB2 transformation. Here, we analysed the molecular mechanisms through which p130Cas controls ErbB2-dependent invasion in three-dimensional cultures of mammary epithelial cells. Concomitant p130Cas over-expression and ErbB2 activation enhance PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2 MAPK signalling pathways and promote invasion of mammary acini. By using pharmacological inhibitors, we demonstrate that both signalling cascades are required for the invasive behaviour of p130Cas over-expressing and ErbB2 activated acini. Erk1/2 MAPK and PI3K/Akt signalling triggers invasion through distinct downstream effectors involving mTOR/p70S6K and Rac1 activation, respectively. Moreover, in silico analyses indicate that p130Cas expression in ErbB2 positive human breast cancers significantly correlates with higher risk to develop distant metastasis, thus underlying the value of the p130Cas/ErbB2 synergism in regulating breast cancer invasion. In conclusion, high levels of p130Cas favour progression of ErbB2-transformed cells towards an invasive phenotype.",

Reovirus (serotype 3), 6 human breast cancer cell lines and normal mammary gland epithelial cell line were used in this study. The mRNA expression of HER2 receptor was examined by RT-PCR, and the protein of HER2 and activated Ras protein were examined by a Western blot analysis. In vitro, the cytopathic effects, viral protein synthesis, and cell viability on infection by reovirus were examined. Reovirus can infect all the 6 examined cancer cell lines, but the control cell line was not susceptible to the reovirus infection. The cytopathic effect appeared from day 1 after infection, and a 50% or greater cytotolysis was demonstrated at day 7 after infection. The Ras activities in all examined cell lines were higher than those in the control cell line. No relationship was observed in the susceptibility to the reovirus and HER2 expression. The increased Ras activity itself, regardless of the HER2 expression, may therefore play an important role in the susceptibility to reovirus of breast cancer cells.

Since these cells are Her2 overexpressing cells, the Her2 intracellular signaling pathways were examined after the treatment. There was no significant changing of kinase activity.

Fluorescence and chromogenic in situ hybridization, using an ABCC3-specific probe, was used to analyze 11 breast cancer cell lines and 112 clinical tumor samples. The results of ABCC3 were correlated with the amplification status of HER2 and topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A), which are located close to ABCC3 at 17q12-q21. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess ABCC3 protein overexpression. Of the cell lines studied 6 HER2-positive lines and 1 HER2-negative line exhibited amplification of ABCC3. In the HER-2-negative clinical tumor samples, only 4/55 (7.3%) exhibited ABCC3 amplification. In the HER2-positive tumors, ABCC3 was amplified in 16/57 tumors (28.1%, P=0.0059). TOP2A did not exhibit any consistent coamplification pattern. ABCC3 (MRP3) protein overexpression was more common in tumors with gene amplification (P=0.069). In silico analysis of 804 breast cancers with matched gene expression and copy number microarray data revealed significant differences ABCC3 across the molecular subtypes. Specifically, increased ABCC3 mRNA and gene copy numbers were most prominent in HER2 amplified and/or HER2-enriched classified tumors. Moreover, differential ABCC3 mRNA levels were found within the HER-2 amplified subset when stratified by the estrogen receptor status. We conclude that ABCC3 is frequently amplified and overexpressed in HER2-positive breast cancer, and something that warrants further studies correlating the results with therapeutic outcome.",

Clinical HER2 status was defined according to American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines or DNA copy-number aberration by single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Cox models tested the prognostic significance of each variable in patients not treated with trastuzumab (n = 1711).;Compared with clinically HER2 (cHER2)-negative breast cancer, cHER2+ breast cancer had a higher frequency of the HER2-enriched (HER2E) subtype (47.0% vs 7.1%) and a lower frequency of Luminal A (10.7% vs 39.0%) and Basal-like (14.1% vs 23.4%) subtypes. The likelihood of cHER2-positivity in HER2E, Luminal B, Basal-like and Luminal A subtypes was 64.6%, 20.0%, 14.4% and 7.3%, respectively. Within each subtype, only 0.3% to 3.9% of genes were found differentially expressed between cHER2+ and cHER2-negative tumors. Within cHER2+ tumors, HER2 gene and protein expression was statistically significantly higher in the HER2E and Basal-like subtypes than either luminal subtype. Neither cHER2 status nor the new 10-subtype copy number-based classification system (IntClust) added independent prognostic value to intrinsic subtype.;When the intrinsic subtypes are taken into account, cHER2-positivity does not translate into large changes in the expression of downstream signaling pathways, nor does it affect patient survival in the absence of HER2 targeting.",

The majority of BRCA1-associated breast cancers are triple-negative and basal-like; the extent to which the BRCA1 pathway contributes to the behavior of sporadic basal-like breast cancers is an area of active research. Epidemiologic studies illustrate a high prevalence of triple-negative breast cancers among younger women and those of African descent. Increasing evidence suggests that the risk factor profile differs between this subtype and the more common luminal subtypes. Although sensitive to chemotherapy, early relapse is common and a predilection for visceral metastasis, including brain metastasis, is seen.

Emerging evidence suggests that MUC4 mucin is associated with metastasis of various cancers, including breast cancer. However, the functional role of MUC4 remains unclear in breast cancers, especially in TNBCs.;In the present study, we investigated the functional and mechanistic roles of MUC4 in potentiating pathogenic signals including EGFR family proteins to promote TNBC aggressiveness using in vitro and in vivo studies. Further, we studied the expression of MUC4 in invasive TNBC tissue and normal breast tissue by immunostaining.;MUC4 promotes proliferation, anchorage-dependent and-independent growth of TNBC cells, augments TNBC cell migratory and invasive potential in vitro, and enhances tumorigenicity and metastasis in vivo. In addition, our studies demonstrated that MUC4 up-regulates the EGFR family of proteins, and augments downstream Erk1/2, PKC-γ, and FAK mediated oncogenic signaling. Moreover, our studies also showed that knockdown of MUC4 in TNBC cells induced molecular changes suggestive of mesenchymal to epithelial transition. We also demonstrated in this study, for the first time, that knockdown of MUC4 was associated with reduced expression of EGFR and ErbB3 (EGFR family proteins) in TNBC cells, suggesting that MUC4 uses an alternative to ErbB2 mechanism to promote aggressiveness. We further demonstrate that MUC4 is differentially over-expressed in invasive TNBC tissues compared to normal breast tissue.;MUC4 mucin expression is associated with TNBC pathobiology, and its knockdown reduced aggressiveness in vitro, and tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo.

Although trastuzumab significantly improves the prognosis of HER2-positive breast cancer, half of the patients with metastatic breast cancer experience disease progression within 1 year. Pertuzumab is a novel HER2-targeted humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the dimerization domain of HER2 and acts synergically with trastuzumab in inhibiting tumor progression. The CLEOPATRA trial demonstrated that adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab plus docetaxel significantly prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival without increasing severe adverse events. Conclusively, pertuzumab was approved by the US FDA in June 2012 for use in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Furthermore, various clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab combined with other cytotoxic agents are ongoing at present. Thus, pertuzumab has been becoming important for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Understanding the signaling differences that distinguish human HER2-amplified (HER2-positive (HER2+)) breast cancers from other breast cancer subtypes may help to identify protein drug targets for the specific treatment of HER2+ breast cancers. We performed two kinome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens on five HER2+ breast cancer cell lines, seven breast cancer cell lines in which HER2 was not amplified and two normal breast cell lines. To pinpoint the main kinases driving HER2 signaling, we performed a comprehensive siRNA screen that identified loss of the HER2/HER3 heterodimer as having the most prominent inhibitory effect on the growth of HER2+ breast cancer cells. In a second siRNA screen focused on identifying genes that could sensitize HER2+ cells to trastuzumab treatment, we found that loss of signaling members downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) potentiated the growth inhibitory effects of trastuzumab. Loss of HER2 and HER3, as well as proteins involved in mitogenic and environmental stress pathways inhibited the proliferation of HER2+ cells only in the absence of trastuzumab, suggesting that these pathways are inhibited by trastuzumab treatment. Loss of essential G2/M cell cycle mediators or proteins involved in vesicle organization exerted inhibitory effects on HER2+ cell growth that were unaffected by trastuzumab. Furthermore, the use of a sensitization index (SI) identified targeting the PI3K pathway to sensitize to trastuzumab treatment. Antagonism using the SI identified MYO3A, MYO3B and MPZL1 as antagonizers to trastuzumab treatment among HER2+ cell lines. Our results suggest that the dimerization partners of HER2 are important for determining the activation of downstream proliferation pathways. Understanding the complex layers of signaling triggered downstream of HER2 homodimers and heterodimers will facilitate the selection of better targets for combination therapies intended to treat HER2+ breast cancers.

        "Doc_abstract":"Intratumoral heterogeneity of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene amplification has been reported to occur with variable frequencies in breast cancers. However, there have been few studies of its clinicopathological significance. We used tissue microarrays to evaluate two aspects of intratumoral heterogeneity of HER2 gene amplification: regional heterogeneity and genetic heterogeneity. We examined 96 invasive breast cancers in which HER2 amplification had been diagnosed in whole sections, and determined the clincopathological characteristics of those tumors. HER2 regional heterogeneity, defined as the existence of amplification/negative or amplification/equivocal patterns in different tissue microarray cores of a tumor, was present in 17 (18%) of the 96 cases. HER2 genetic heterogeneity, defined as the presence of tumor cells with a HER2/chromosome enumeration probe 17 ratio higher than 2.2 in 5-50% of the tumor cells, was found in 11 cases (11%), all of which showed HER2 regional heterogeneity. The cases with intratumoral heterogeneity of HER2 gene amplification were characterized by low grade or equivocal HER2 amplification and equivocal (2+) HER2 expression in whole sections. The patients with intratumoral heterogeneity of HER2 gene amplification had significantly shorter disease-free survival times than those with homogeneous HER2 gene amplification, and this effect was also evident in subgroup analysis by hormone receptor status. In multivariate analysis, intratumoral HER2 heterogeneity retained its status as an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival. In conclusion, intratumoral heterogeneity of HER2 gene amplification is present in a subset of HER2-amplified breast cancers, especially in cases with low-grade HER2 amplification and equivocal HER2 expression, indicating a need for HER2 testing on more representative, larger tumor samples for accurate assessment of HER2 status in such cases. The patients with this heterogeneity have decreased disease-free survival, suggesting that genetic instability, and hence aberrant HER2 amplification in subclones of such tumors, may be associated with breast cancer progression.",

The barrier in the past to the use of HER2 has been the nonstandardization of HER2 status determination, which is the major caveat to its use today. Two test kits have been recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for HER2 testing, one for determining HER2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization and the other for measuring HER2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry. Neither of these tests, nor any of the other myriad tests used for HER2 determinations, has been validated in all the potential arenas for the use of HER2: refinement of estimates of prognosis of untreated low-risk patients, selection among treatment options for adjuvant therapy, and selection of patients for treatment with trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech, San Francisco, CA). The nonstandardization of testing has led to conflicting results and controversy as to the value of HER2 in evaluating breast cancer patient prognosis and the selection among therapeutic options. Thus, testing for HER2 is not yet routine for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, although it is of value for patients who develop metastatic disease and who need to know if they are candidates for trastuzumab.",

Mouse model studies have demonstrated that activated Stat5a acts as a critical survival factor for normal, preneoplastic and malignant mammary epithelial cells. Very limited information is available, however, on the expression, tyrosine phosphorylation status and nuclear localization of Stat5a in human breast cancers. In our study, the pattern of Stat5a cellular localization was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a series of 83 randomly selected primary human breast adenocarcinomas. Immunoprecipitation/Western blotting and immunohistochemistry assays employing different phospho-specific antibodies verified Stat5a tyrosine phosphorylation status. Stat5a was nuclear localized and tyrosine phosphorylated in 59 of 78 (76%) breast cancers examined; 38 of 78 (49%) demonstrated Stat5a nuclear localization in more than 25% of the breast cancer cells within the adenocarcinomas. Nuclear localized Stat5a was associated positively with increased levels of histologic differentiation (p = 0.03). A statistically significant positive association with p27 nuclear localization also was identified (p = 0.05). No relationship was found between nuclear localized Stat5a and menopausal status, tumor size, ploidy, percentage of cells in S-phase, lymph node metastases, ER, ErbB2, nuclear localized p21 or nuclear localized Stat5b/Stat3.

Chromogranin A and synaptophysin have been considered as the most sensitive and specific neuroendocrine markers in NEBC. At the molecular level, recent gene expression profiling studies have shown that NEBCs pertain to the luminal molecular type, being positive for hormone receptors and negative for HER2. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that mucinous and neuroendocrine carcinomas are transcriptionally distinct from conventional invasive ductal carcinomas. Following the above criteria, NEBCs constitute approximately 1% of all breast carcinomas.

        "Doc_abstract":"An increase in the incidence of breast cancer patients with brain metastases has been observed over the last years, mainly because the recent development of new drugs including therapies targeting HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) resulted in an increased survival of these patients. With HER2+ patients living longer and the well-known neurotropism of HER2+ tumour cells, the resulting high incidence of brain metastases is not really surprising. Moreover, brain metastases more often occur within a context of existing extracranial metastases. These need to be treated at the same time in order to favourably impact patients' survival. Consequently, the management of breast cancer patients with brain metastases clearly relies on a multidisciplinary approach, including systemic treatment. A working group including neuro-oncologists, neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists and oncologists was created in order to provide French national guidelines for the management of brain metastases within the \"Association des neuro-oncologues d'expression française\" (ANOCEF). The recommendations regarding the systemic treatment in breast cancer patients are reported here including key features of their management. ",

Recently, breast cancer has been treated with innovative approaches that use hormone-sensitive therapies. This is because in at least one-third of breast cancers, estrogens mediated via the estrogen receptor pathway act as endocrine growth factors. Fulvestrant has been studied as both first- and second-line therapy for locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer, but few studies have shown its effect as third-line therapy alone. To observe the disease time to progression (TTP) obtained with fulvestrant when used on metastatic breast cancer as first-, second-, and also third-line therapy. We also aimed to correlate the TTP obtained with fulvestrant with hormone receptor, HER2 expression, and metastatic site. This was a cohort study that retrospectively examined medical records of 73 postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who were treated with fulvestrant (250 mg/month i.m. injection) and followed at the Department of Medical Oncology at Hospital do Cancer A. C. Camargo in São Paulo, Brazil from August 2003 to December 2006. The median TTP with fulvestrant was about 11 months. When used as the first-line therapy, TTP was about 13 months; when used as second-line, TTP was about 6 months; and when used as third-line, it was about 12 months. No statistically significant difference was observed regarding the therapy line. In patients with positive ER tumors, TTP was 11 months. No significant difference in TTP was observed in negative ER tumors (TTP = 10 months). In patients with positive PgR tumors, TTP was 13 months and for negative PgR, TTP was 6 months (P = 0.008). According to the HER2 status, the TTP was 5 months for HER2+ and 10 months for HER2-. Our findings indicate that fulvestrant is an effective alternative for treatment of metastatic breast cancer.",

As molecular features are increasingly used for predicting cancer prognosis and response to therapy, better knowledge of ethnic molecular features is important. To identify potential molecular differences between breast cancers in Europe and the Middle East, we analyzed consecutive breast cancer series from Switzerland (n=2197) and Saudi Arabia (n=204). Tissue microarrays were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization for HER2, CCND1, MYC, and EGFR amplification. The data revealed marked differences between Saudi and Swiss patients. Saudi breast cancers had a markedly higher frequency of HER2 (31 vs 17%; P<0.0001) and MYC (16 vs 5%; P<0.0001) amplifications than Swiss breast cancers. Remarkably, this was partly due to a much higher incidence of grade 3 cancers in the Saudi than in the Swiss population (65 vs 32%; P<0.0001). However, differences in amplification frequency hold also true within grade 3 cancers (HER2: 40 vs 30%, P<0.05; MYC: 22 vs 11%, P=0.002). Interestingly, in combination with known age standardized incidence rates of breast cancer in Saudi Arabia (21.6/100 000) and Switzerland (70.1/100 000), these data suggest that the incidence of high-grade breast cancer is comparable for Saudi and Swiss women, while the incidence of low-grade breast cancers is about 14 times lower in Saudi than for Swiss women. These observations suggest that a difference in genetic susceptibility and/or lifestyle between Saudi and Swiss women has a substantial and much higher than expected impact on the risk of low-grade breast cancer.",

Several previous studies have shown that the immunophenotype of distant breast cancer metastases may be different from that of the primary tumor (\"receptor conversion\"), leading to inappropriate choice of systemic treatment. The studies published so far are however small and/or methodologically suboptimal. Therefore, definite conclusions that may change clinical practice could not yet be drawn. We therefore aimed to study receptor conversion for estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in a large group of distant (non-bone) breast cancer metastases by re-staining all primary tumors and metastases with current optimal immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization methods on full sections.;233 distant breast cancer metastases from different sites (76 skin, 63 liver, 43 lung, 44 brain and 7 gastro-intestinal) were IHC stained for ERα, PR and HER2, and expression was compared to that of the primary tumor. HER2 in situ hybridization (ISH) was done in cases of IHC conversion or when primary tumors or metastases showed an IHC 2+ result.;Using a 10% threshold, receptor conversion by IHC for ERα, PR occurred in 10.3%, 30.0% of patients, respectively. In 10.7% of patients, conversion from \"ER+ or PR+\" to ER-/PR- and in 3.4% from ER-/PR- to \"ER+ or PR+\" was found. Using a 1% threshold, ERα and PR conversion rates were 15.1% and 32.6%. In 12.4% of patients conversion from \"ER+ or PR+\" to ER-/PR-, and 8.2% from ER-/PR- to \"ER+ or PR+\" occurred. HER2 conversion occurred in 5.2%. Of the 12 cases that showed HER2 conversion by IHC, 5 showed also conversion by ISH. One further case showed conversion by ISH, but not by IHC. Conversion was mainly from positive in the primary tumor to negative in the metastases for ERα and PR, while HER2 conversion occurred equally both ways. PR conversion occurred significantly more often in liver, brain and gastro-intestinal metastases.;Receptor conversion by immunohistochemistry in (non-bone) distant breast cancer metastases does occur, is relatively uncommon for ERα and HER2, and more frequent for PR, especially in brain, liver and gastro-intestinal metastases.",

Each group was further subdivided into 2 subgroups: 1) simultaneous administration of quercetin and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT); 2) sequential administration of quercetin (12-h induction) followed by OHT. No drug exposure and OHT alone were used as controls. We determined cell survival, apoptosis, and expression of ERα (estrogen receptor α) and Her-2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2).;With increasing dosage of quercetin, significant decrease in proliferation and increase in apoptosis was observed. Low concentrations of quercetin (10 μM) had no effects. We found no significant difference between simultaneous and sequential mode of drug administration. Further, with increasing dosage of quercetin, we observed a gradual reduction in Her-2 expression and upregulation of ERα. Again, no difference in Her-2 and ERα protein levels between simultaneous and sequential drug administration was noticed.;Proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in MCF-7Ca/TAM-R cells increase with increasing dosage of quercetin. This suggests that quercetin can reverse tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer cells. The underlying mechanism likely involves upregulation of ERα combined with downregulation of Her-2. However, this effect is independent of whether quercetin and tamoxifen are administered simultaneously or sequentially.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Amplification of the HER2 oncogene in breast cancer identifies patients who are likely to respond to anti-HER2 mAb therapy. Current clinical practice dictates that all breast cancers first undergo HER2 screening by IHC. Strongly positive (3+ on a 0-to-3+ scale) IHC cases are considered as HER2-amplified tumors and are not evaluated further because of the strong correlation between HER2 gene amplification as measured by FISH and 3+ IHC. This strong correlation has recently been questioned, and some data suggest that over 50% of 3+ IHC HER2 immunostains may not be due to HER2 gene amplification. To help resolve this discrepancy, the authors developed a quantitative PCR assay for HER2. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the amount of HER2 DNA relative to a control gene, IF2 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor, 2p11.1-q11.1). The PCR assay is performed on genomic DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue. The PCR assay developed is a monoplex assay in which the HER2 and IF2 PCRs are performed in separate cuvettes. Cases of HER2 FISH amplified breast cancer and HER2 FISH nonamplified breast cancer were chosen for study by monoplex HER2 PCR. HER2 overexpression was evaluated by IHC. Twenty-two cases of HER2-positive and 22 cases of HER2-negative breast cancer, as determined by FISH, were assayed for HER2 by PCR and IHC. Sixteen of the 44 cases were interpreted as 3+ IHC. All 16 showed HER2 amplification by PCR and 15 showed HER2 amplification by FISH. One FISH negative case was found to be HER2 amplified by PCR and showed 3+ IHC stain, suggesting the FISH result in this case was underinterpreted. Two FISH positive cases were found to be negative by PCR and negative in IHC as well, suggesting the FISH result in these cases was overinterpreted. The authors conclude that 3+ IHC membrane staining correctly identifies neoplasms showing HER2 gene amplification. Monoplex HER2 PCR may offer significant advantages over both IHC and FISH for HER2 testing in breast cancer.",

Efficacy was measured primarily as the time to progression (TTP) and, secondarily, as the objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival. HER2 ECD levels were determined by using a sandwich enzyme HER2/neu immunoassay before letrozole treatment was initiated.

The median TTP was significantly shorter among patients who had elevated HER2 ECD compared with the median TTP among patients who had normal levels (4 months vs 14 months; P = .0004), and the ORR was lower in the group with elevated HER2 ECD levels (14% vs 30%; P < .036).

Progesterone receptor (PR) is also a widely used marker, although its value is less well established. HER-2 status has also become a routine prognostic and predictive factor in breast cancer. Given the importance of these biological markers in patient management, it is essential that assays are robust and quality controlled, and that interpretation is standardized. Furthermore, it is important to be aware of the limitations in their predictive power, and how this may be refined through addition of further biological markers.

Young women with breast cancer are more likely to present with higher stage than their older counterparts. Their tumors are more likely to be estrogen receptor-negative, higher grade, and have increased LVI, Ki-67, and p53; yet most studies show no difference in HER-2/neu expression between younger and older women. Recent advances in molecular biology have shown that lymph node negative, estrogen receptor-positive young women are more likely than older women to have a higher Recurrence Scoretrade mark and therefore a worse prognosis.

Our aim was to explore the effects of ZD1839 in breast cancer cell lines expressing different levels of EGFR and the closely related HER2 receptor.;We studied the growth-inhibitory effects of ZD1839 in a series of breast carcinoma cell lines. In HER2-overexpressing BT-474 breast cancer cells, we studied the effects of ZD1839 on cell growth and heterodimerization of receptors under basal and ligand-stimulated conditions.;ZD1839 was an equally potent inhibitor of growth in breast cancer cells expressing high levels of EGFR and HER2. In BT-474 breast cancer cells, ZD1839 abolished EGF- and heregulin-induced activation of ErbB receptors and downstream signaling molecules. Because ZD1839 does not inhibit the HER2 tyrosine kinase in vitro, and because heregulin is a ligand that activates HER2 by binding to HER3 and HER4 but does not bind to the EGFR, our findings suggested that ZD1839 interfered with HER2 function in intact cells. Searching for mechanisms, we report that ZD1839 induces the formation of inactive unphosphorylated EGFR/HER2 and EGFR/HER3 heterodimers. Furthermore, ZD1839 completely abolishes basal and heregulin-induced formation of active phosphorylated HER2/HER3 heterodimers.;ZD1839 inhibits the growth of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, possibly by sequestration of HER2 and HER3 receptors in an inactive heterodimer configuration with the EGFR.

The MDA-MB-453 cells, which have been shown to overexpress ErbB2, were resistant to 5-fluorouracil; 5-fluorouracil exhibited a small dose-dependent anti-proliferative effect, with an IC50 of 90 microM. Interestingly, combined treatment with apigenin significantly decreased the resistance. Cellular proliferation was significantly inhibited in cells exposed to 5-fluorouracil at its IC50 and apigenin (5, 10, 50 and 100 microM), compared with proliferation in cells exposed to 5-fluorouracil alone. This inhibition in turn led to apoptosis, as evidenced by an increased number of apoptotic cells and the activation of caspase-3. To investigate the mechanism by which the combination of 5-fluorouracil and apigenin induces apoptosis, ErbB2 expression was analyzed. The level of ErbB2 was unchanged by 5-fluorouracil alone but was drastically reduced in cells treated with 5-fluorouracil plus apigenin. Moreover, compared with 5-fluorouracil alone, 5-fluorouracil in combination with apigenin at concentrations >10 microM exerted a pro-apoptotic effect via the inhibition of Akt expression. Taken together, our results suggest that 5-fluorouracil acts synergistically with apigenin inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis via the down-regulation of ErbB2 expression and Akt signaling.",

Reproductive factors may plausibly be differentially correlated with the risk of different breast cancer subtypes because these factors are presumed to impact exposure to endogenous sex hormones.;The authors pooled 2 population-based, case-control studies of breast cancer in women ages 55 to 79 years for an analysis including 1476 controls and 1023 cases of luminal breast cancer, 39 cases of HER-2-overexpressing breast cancer, and 78 cases of triple-negative breast cancer. Polytomous logistic regression was used to compare each case group with controls.;Associations varied by molecular subtype. Early age at menarche was only found to be associated with risk of HER-2-overexpressing disease (odds ratio [OR] of 2.7; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.4-5.5), whereas breastfeeding for > or =6 months was only found to be protective for luminal and triple-negative disease (OR of 0.8 [95% CI, 0.6-1.0] and OR of 0.5 [95% CI, 0.3-0.9], respectively). Both late age at menopause and the use of estrogen plus progestin hormone therapy were only found to be associated with risk of luminal disease (OR of 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.2] and OR of 1.7 [95% CI, 1.3-2.1], respectively). No differences in risks associated with parity or age at first live birth were observed by subtype.;Certain reproductive factors may have a greater impact on the risk of certain molecular subtypes of disease compared with others.

In this context, re-evaluation of HER2 status by assessment of HER2 expression on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is a strategy with potential clinical application. The aim of this trial was to determine the HER2 status of CTCs in metastatic breast cancer patients comparing two CTC assays. A total of 254 patients with metastatic breast cancer from nine German university breast cancer centers were enrolled in this prospective study. HER2 status of CTCs was assessed using both the FDA-approved CellSearch® assay and AdnaTest BreastCancer™. Using the CellSearch assay, 122 of 245 (50%) patients had ≥5 CTCs, and HER2-positive CTCs were observed in 50 (41%) of these patients. Ninety of 229 (39%) patients were CTC positive using AdnaTest BreastCancer, and HER2 positivity rate was 47% (42 of 90). The rate of breast cancer patients with HER2-negative primary tumors but HER2-positive CTCs was 32% (25 of 78) and 49% (28 of 57) using the CellSearch assay and AdnaTest BreastCancer, respectively. Considering only those patients who had CTCs on both tests (n = 62), concordant results regarding HER2 positivity were obtained in 50% of the patients (31/62) (P = 0.96, κ = -0.006). HER2-positive CTCs can be detected in a relevant number of patients with HER2 negative primary tumors. Therefore, it will be mandatory to correlate the assay-dependent HER2 status of CTCs to the clinical response on HER2-targeted therapies.",

These molecules interfere with the homeostasis of the body, usually through mimicking natural hormones leading to activation or blocking of their receptors. Many of these compounds have been associated with a broad range of diseases including the development or increased susceptibility to breast cancer, the most prevalent cancer in women worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Thus, this article presents a virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) to evaluate the affinity of proteins related to breast cancer, such as ESR1, ERBB2, PGR, BCRA1, and SHBG, among others, with EDCs from urban sources. A blind docking strategy was employed to screen each protein-ligand pair in triplicate in AutoDock Vina 2.0, using the computed binding affinities as ranking criteria. The three-dimensional structures were previously obtained from EDCs DataBank and Protein Data Bank, prepared and optimized by SYBYL X-2.0. Some of the chemicals that exhibited the best affinity scores for breast cancer proteins in each category were 1,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, bisphenol A derivatives, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, and benzo(a)pyrene, for catalase, several proteins, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cytochrome P450 1A2, respectively. An experimental validation of this approach was performed with a complex that gave a moderate binding affinity in silico, the sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and bisphenol A (BPA) complex. The protein was obtained using DNA recombinant technology and the physical interaction with BPA assessed through spectroscopic techniques. BPA binds on the recombinant SHBG, and this results in an increase of its α helix content. In short, this work shows the potential of several EDCs to bind breast cancer associated proteins as a tool to prioritize compounds to perform in vitro analysis to benefit the regulation or exposure prevention by the general population.

Nestin protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between nestin and other parameters was analyzed by using chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. Nestin expression was observed in 37.6% (41/109) of cases. There were no significant differences between the age of >40 and ≤40 years group in terms of nestin expression (39.8 vs 18.2%; P = 0.161). The rate of nestin expression between those with and without lymph node metastasis was not significantly different (X (2) = 0.086; P = 0.769). The 5-year survival rates of the patients with nestin expression and those without were 34.1% (14/41) and 55.9% (38/68), respectively (P = 0.028). Overall, triple-negative breast cancers had higher expression rates than other cancers (54.1 vs 29.2%; P = 0.011). Nestin expression rate in ER- and PR-negative tumors was found to be significantly higher than cases that were ER- and PR-positive (P = 0.011 and P = 0.036, respectively).

        "Doc_abstract":"In breast cancer tumor expression of estrogen receptors (ERs) is important as a marker of prognosis and mostly as a predictor of response to endocrine therapy. In fact, the loss of α-ER expression leads to unresponsiveness to anti-hormone treatment. In a significant fraction of breast cancers, this loss of expression is a result of epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, within the α-ER promoter. Previous studies have shown that pharmacologic inhibition of these mechanisms using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (AZA), and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, Trichostatin A (TSA), results in expression of functional α-ER mRNA and protein. Moreover, the activity of a novel HDAC inhibitor, Scriptaid, has been shown to induce inhibition of tumor growth in breast cancer and to cause re-expression of functional α-ER in α-ER negative breast cancer cells. We sought to better characterize the effects of Scriptaid on cell growth, apoptosis, and α-ER expression in α-ER-positive (MCF-7), α-ER-negative (MDA-MB-231), and α-ER-negative/Her-2 over-expressing (SKBr-3) human breast cancer cell lines. In all of these cell lines Scriptaid treatment resulted in significant growth inhibition and apoptosis, and RT-PCR confirmed an increase of α-ER mRNA transcript in MDA-MB-231 after 48 h of Scriptaid treatment. Furthermore, following treatment with Scriptaid, the formerly unresponsive MDA-MB-231 and SKBr-3 breast cancer cells became responsive to tamoxifen. These results show that the HDAC inhibitor Scriptaid is able to sensitize tamoxifen hormone-resistant breast cancer cells, and that Scriptaid or related HDAC inhibitors are candidates for further study in breast cancer.",

The aim of the present study was to show that treatment of low HER2-expressing breast cancer cells with gemcitabine (GEM) enhanced HER2 expression using RT-qPCR, immunoblot and flow cytometric analysis. The results showed that GEM treatment significantly enhanced HER2 expression in MDA-MB-231, MCF7 and BT-20 breast cancer cells, while paclitaxel (PTX) treatment induced lower or no enhancement in HER2 expression. The expression of HER2 mRNA was also enhanced in GEM-treated MCF7 cells. Treatment with an inhibitor for nuclear factor-(NF)-κB suppressed GEM-induced HER2 upregulation, indicating that NF-κB activation by GEM may be associated with HER2 upregulation. T-DM1 binding to HER2 on MCF-7 cells was enhanced by GEM pretreatment and the combined treatment of GEM and T-DM1 synergistically inhibited the proliferation of MCF7 cells.

Results from breast cancer treatment trials suggest that aromatase inhibitors may be even more effective in preventing breast cancer than SERMs. However, while SERMs and aromatase inhibitors do prevent the development of many ER-positive breast cancers, these drugs do not prevent ER-negative breast cancer. These results show that new approaches are needed for the prevention of this aggressive form of breast cancer. Our laboratory and clinical efforts have been focused on identifying critical molecular pathways in breast cells that can be targeted for the prevention of ER-negative breast cancer. Our preclinical studies have demonstrated that other nuclear receptors, such as RXR receptors, vitamin D receptors, as well as others are critical for the growth of ER-negative breast cells and for the transformation of these cells into ER-negative cancers. Other studies show that growth factor pathways including those activated by EGFR, Her2, and IGFR, which are activated in many ER-negative breast cancers, can be targeted for the prevention of ER-negative breast cancer in mice. Clinical studies have also shown that PARP inhibitors are effective for the treatment of breast cancers arising in BRCA-1 or -2 mutation carriers, suggesting that targeting PARP may also be useful for the prevention of breast cancers arising in these high-risk individuals. Most recently, we have demonstrated that ER-negative breast cancers can be subdivided into four distinct groups based on the kinases that they express. These groups include ER-negative/Her-2-positive groups (the MAPK and immunomodulatory groups) and ER-negative/Her2-negative groups (the S6K and the cell cycle checkpoint groups). These groups of ER-negative breast cancers can be targeted with kinase inhibitors specific for each subgroup. These preclinical studies have supported the development of several clinical trials testing targeted agents for the prevention of breast cancer. The results of a completed Phase II cancer prevention trial using the RXR ligand bexarotene in women at high risk of breast cancer will be reviewed, and the current status of an ongoing Phase II trial using the EGFR and Her2 kinase inhibitor lapatinib for the treatment of women with DCIS breast cancer will be presented. It is anticipated that in the future these molecularly targeted drugs will be combined with hormonal agents such as SERMs or aromatase inhibitors to prevent all forms of breast cancer.",

Expression of COX-2 also is correlated with the oncogene HER-2/neu. The efficacy of current endocrine therapies for breast cancer is predicted only if the tumor contains significant amounts of estrogen receptor. Because the progesterone receptor (PR) is an estrogen-induced target gene, it has been suggested that its presence may serve as an indicator of estrogen receptor functional capacity and the differentiation state of the tumor. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that PR serves a crucial protective role by antagonizing inflammatory response pathways in the breast. We observed that progesterone antagonized the stimulatory effects of cAMP and IL-1beta on aromatase, COX-2, and HER-2/neu expression in T47D breast cancer cells. These actions of progesterone were associated with increased expression of the nuclear factor-kappaB inhibitor, IkappaBalpha. In 28 breast cancer cell lines, IkappaBalpha expression was positively correlated with PR mRNA levels; overexpression of a phosphorylation-defective mutant of IkappaBalpha inhibited expression of aromatase, COX-2, and HER-2/neu. Moreover, in breast cancer cell lines cultured in the absence of progesterone, up-regulation of endogenous PR caused decreased expression of aromatase, COX-2, and HER-2/neu expression, whereas down-regulation of endogenous PR resulted in a marked induction of aromatase and HER-2/neu mRNA. Collectively, these findings suggest that PR plays an important antiinflammatory role in breast cancer cells via ligand-dependent and ligand-independent mechanisms.",

Loss of ER in recurrent breast cancer is associated with poor response to endocrine therapy. G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) is expressed in half of ER-negative breast cancers. Tumor cell-derived heregulin-β1 (HRG-β1) is also found mainly in ER-negative cancer. In SkBr3 breast cancer cells that lack ER but express GPR30, HRG-β1 upregulates mRNA and protein levels of GPR30 by promoting ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimerization and activating the downstream MAPK-ERK signaling pathway. Moreover, GPR30 boosts HRG-β1-induced migration and invasion of SkBr3 cells after combinative treatment with E2, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen or the specific GPR30 agonist G-1, which are blocked by the specific GPR30 antagonist G-15 or the transfection with the small interfering RNA for GPR30. The ErbB2 inhibitor AG825 and the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 also partly inhibit the enhanced migration and invasion. Therefore, HRG-β1-induced migration and invasion partly depend on the upregulation of GPR30 expression through activation of the ErbB2-ERK pathway in SkBr3 cells. The results of this study indicate that the crosstalk between GPR30 and HRGs signaling is important for endocrine therapy resistance and may provide a new therapeutic way to treat breast cancer.",

We analyzed each subtype for clinical and pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and examined the relationship of response to distant disease-free survival and overall survival.;Of the 107 patients tested, 34 (32%) were basal-like, 11 (10%) were HER2+/ER-, and 62 (58%) were luminal. After neoadjuvant AC, 75% received subsequent chemotherapy and all received endocrine therapy if hormone receptor-positive. The chemotherapy regimen and pretreatment stage did not differ by subtype. Clinical response to AC was higher among the HER2+/ER- (70%) and basal-like (85%) than the luminal subtypes (47%; P < 0.0001). Pathologic complete response occurred in 36% of HER2+/ER-, 27% of basal-like, and 7% of luminal subtypes (P = 0.01). Despite initial chemosensitivity, patients with the basal-like and HER2+/ER- subtypes had worse distant disease-free survival (P = 0.04) and overall survival (P = 0.02) than those with the luminal subtypes. Regardless of subtype, only 2 of 17 patients with pathologic complete response relapsed. The worse outcome among basal-like and HER+/ER- subtypes was due to higher relapse among those with residual disease (P = 0.003).;Basal-like and HER2+/ER- subtypes are more sensitive to anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy than luminal breast cancers. Patients that had pathologic complete response to chemotherapy had a good prognosis regardless of subtype.

Transfection of galectin-3 null BT549 breast cancer cells with His64 galectin-3 rendered them sensitive to TRAIL, while Pro64 galectin-3-transfected cells remained resistant to TRAIL. This article highlights that galectin-3 receptor expression and genotype may be useful markers in predicting TRAIL or agonistic antibody sensitivity of breast cancer patients.",

Here, we have assessed the clinical significance of the proteolytically cleavable ErbB4 isoforms in breast cancer patients and investigated their functions in vitro. The expression of transcripts encoding the cleavable ErbB4 isoforms associated with estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) expression (P < 0.001) and a high histologic grade of differentiation (P </= 0.002) in real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis of 62 breast cancer samples. Despite high ErbB4 mRNA expression levels in a subset of samples, ErbB4 gene amplification was not observed. High ErbB4 protein expression levels, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, associated with a favorable outcome in ER-positive cases from a series of 458 breast cancer patients (P = 0.01), whereas no association between ErbB4 expression and survival was found among women with ER-negative cancer (P = 0.86). However, nuclear ErbB4 immunoreactivity was associated with poor survival as compared with women whose cancer had membranous ErbB4 staining (P = 0.04). In vitro, overexpression of a cleavable ErbB4 isoform in ER-positive breast cancer cells resulted in translocation of a proteolytically released intracellular ErbB4 receptor fragment into the nucleus, as well as, enhanced proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and estrogen response element-mediated transcriptional activity. These results suggest that the association of ErbB4 expression with clinical outcome is dependent on the subcellular localization of ErbB4 and that a proteinase-cleavable ErbB4 isoform promotes growth of ER-positive breast cancer and enhances ER-mediated gene transcription.",

In this work an electrochemical immunosensor for the analysis of HER2 ECD in human serum samples was developed. To achieve this goal a screen-printed carbon electrode, modified with gold nanoparticles, was used as transducer surface. A sandwich immunoassay, using two monoclonal antibodies, was employed and the detection of the antibody-antigen interaction was performed through the analysis of an enzymatic reaction product by linear sweep voltammetry. Using the optimized experimental conditions the calibration curve (ip vs. log[HER2 ECD]) was established between 15 and 100 ng/mL and a limit of detection (LOD) of 4.4 ng/mL was achieved. These results indicate that the developed immunosensor could be a promising tool in breast cancer diagnostics, patient follow-up and monitoring of metastatic breast cancer since it allows quantification in a useful concentration range and has an LOD below the established cut-off value (15 ng/mL).",

Until recently, combination chemotherapy was the most effective and only adjuvant treatment for HER2-positive patients. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the HER2 extracellular domain, has recently demonstrated highly reproducible and astonishing benefit in halving the recurrence rate and reducing mortality in five adjuvant breast cancer trials. But such unfettered success has come at a cost, both in terms of cardiotoxic risk and substantial financial burden. Though trastuzumab has been able to significantly improve clinical outcomes of many patients with early breast cancer, the reality is that an unacceptable proportion will still relapse. Beyond trastuzumab, what is the next step for these HER2-positive breast cancers? This review first discusses the individual results of the five adjuvant trastuzumab studies in terms of efficacy and safety, highlighting their similarities and differences.

In five of six instances, two or more chromosomal regions were found amplified in the same hsr. In the tumor with the less modified karyotype, the two hsr comprised DNA sequences from three different chromosomes and showed different patterns of amplification.

Similarly, levels of Ets-1 mRNA were not significantly different in fibroadenomas and primary breast carcinomas. Using Western blotting, four forms of the Ets-1 protein were detected, that is, p33, p42, p51 and p52. Levels of both p51 and p52 but not p33 and p42 were present at significantly higher levels in the carcinomas compared to the fibroadenomas (for p51, P<0.007; for p52, P<0.02; Mann-Whitney U-test). Levels of p52, p51 and p33 correlated significantly with uPA protein levels (P<0.01), while only levels of p52 correlated significantly with HER-2/neu protein levels (P<0.01). Using immunohistochemistry, Ets-1 was found predominantly in tumour cells, but was also detected in some stromal cells surrounding tumour islands. We conclude that, while at the mRNA level, Ets-1 was found at similar levels in fibroadenomas and primary breast carcinomas, higher protein levels were detected in the cancers compared to the benign specimens.

Overexpression of p53 significantly correlated with younger age (<40), pre-menopausal status, poor differentiation with inverse correlation with bcl-2 expression. Expression of bcl-2 immunopostivity significantly correlated to low histological grade and positive estrogen and progesterone receptor status. On univariate and multivariate p53 overexpression and lack of bcl-2 immunostaining resulted in worse survival outcome, but not Her-2/neu overexpression.

HRG can bind to receptor tyrosine kinases erbB3 and erbB4, thereby inducing erbB3 and erbB4 heterodimerization with erbB2, leading to receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and activating downstream signal transduction. Cell-cell homophilic adhesion (cell aggregation) is important in determining the structural organization and behavior of cells in tissues. In addition, tumor cell homophilic adhesion may affect invasive and metastatic potentials of cells. We report that HRG-beta1 can enhance aggregation of MCF-7 and SKBR3 human breast cancer cells. While investigating the downstream signals involved in HRG-beta1-enhanced cell aggregation, we observed that HRG-beta1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of erbB2 and crbB3 receptor heterodimers and increased the association of the dimerized receptors with the 85-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). HRG-beta also increased the kinase activities of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and PI3K in these cells. By using the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK 1 (MEK1) inhibitor PD98059 and PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, we found that blocking the MEK1-ERK pathway had no effect on HRG-pbeta1-enhanced cell aggregation; however, blocking the PI3K pathway greatly inhibited HRG-beta1-mediated cell aggregation. Our study indicated that the HRG-beta1-activated MEK1-ERK pathway has no demonstrable role in the induction of cell aggregation, whereas HRG-beta1-activated PI3K is required for enhancing breast cancer cell aggregation. Because aggregation can contribute to invasion/metastasis phenotype of cancer cells, our results have provided one mechanism by which HRG-beta1-activated signaling of erbB receptors may affect invasive/metastatic properties of MCF-7 and SKBR3 breast cancer cells.",

The comparative incidence and significance of HER-2/neu gene amplification for lobular and ductal breast cancer have not been previously characterized.;Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary breast cancer tissue sections from 71 women diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma were tested for HER-2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method using the Ventana unique sequence probe (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). A series of 106 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma was similarly processed and tested. Lymph node status was available for 155 (88%) of the 177 cases and 82 (46%) were lymph node-negative (LN-) and 73 (41%) were lymph node-positive (LN+). Patients were treated for a mean of 65 months (range 1-169 months).;9 of 71 (13%) cases of lobular cancer featured HER-2/neu gene amplification, whereas 51 (48%) of 106 cases of ductal cancer showed amplification (P < 0.0001). On univariate analysis of combined lobular and ductal cases, HER-2/neu gene amplification detected by FISH predicted disease-related death (P < 0.0001). HER-2/neu gene amplification also predicted disease-related death in lobular cases alone (P = 0.003), LN+ lobular cases separately (P = 0.019), and LN- and LN+ ductal cases separately and alone (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis of the lobular group alone revealed that LN+ status (P = 0.015) and stage (P = 0.01) were independent predictors of disease-related death, and HER-2/neu gene amplification reached near significance (P = 0.086). In the ductal carcinoma group alone, HER-2/neu gene amplification (P = 0.03), lymph node status (P = 0.0001), tumor stage (P = 0.0001), and tumor grade (P = 0.044) were independent predictors of overall disease survival.;HER-2/neu gene amplification detected by FISH was identified at a significantly lower rate in lobular compared with ductal breast cancer. HER-2/neu gene amplification when present in lobular breast cancer is a significant adverse prognostic factor.",

We conducted a systematic review of flax for efficacy in improving menopausal symptoms in women living with breast cancer and for potential impact on risk of breast cancer incidence or recurrence.;We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and AMED from inception to January 2013 for human interventional or observational data pertaining to flax and breast cancer.;Of 1892 records, we included a total of 10 studies: 2 randomized controlled trials, 2 uncontrolled trials, 1 biomarker study, and 5 observational studies. Nonsignificant (NS) decreases in hot flash symptomatology were seen with flax ingestion (7.5 g/d). Flax (25 g/d) increased tumor apoptotic index (P< .05) and decreased HER2 expression (P< .05) and cell proliferation (Ki-67 index; NS) among newly diagnosed breast cancer patients when compared with placebo. Uncontrolled and biomarker studies suggest beneficial effects on hot flashes, cell proliferation, atypical cytomorphology, and mammographic density, as well as possible anti-angiogenic activity at doses of 25 g ground flax or 50 mg secoisolariciresinol diglycoside daily. Observational data suggests associations between flax and decreased risk of primary breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.69-0.97), better mental health (AOR = 1.76; 95% CI = 1.05-2.94), and lower mortality (multivariate hazard ratio = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.50-0.95) among breast cancer patients.;Current evidence suggests that flax may be associated with decreased risk of breast cancer.

A polymorphism at codon 655 (GTC/valine to ATC /isoleucine [Val(655)Ile]) in the transmembrane domain-coding region of this gene has been identified and may be associated with the risk of breast cancer. We evaluated this hypothesis in a subgroup of women who participated in a large-scale, population-based, case-control study of breast cancer in Shanghai, China.;Genomic DNA from 339 patients with breast cancer and 361 healthy control subjects was examined for the Val(655)Ile polymorphism with a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism-based assay. All study subjects completed a structured questionnaire during an in-person interview. All P values are from two-sided tests.;We found that 25.1% of the case patients and 21.7% of the control subjects were heterozygous for the Val allele and 3.2% of the case patients and 0. 3% of the control subjects were homozygous for this allele (P =.005). Compared with women with the Ile/Ile genotype, women who had the Ile/Val or Val/Val genotype had an elevated risk of breast cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-2.0; P =. 05) after adjustment for age, educational level, study period, history of breast fibroadenoma, leisure physical activity, and age at first live birth. The risk was elevated even more among women who were homozygous for the Val allele (OR = 14.1; 95% CI = 1.8-113.4). The association was more pronounced among younger women (</=45 years) than among older women (>45 years). The adjusted OR associated with the Val allele was 1.7 (95% CI = 1.1-2.6) for younger women and 1.0 (95% CI = 0.5-1.9) for older women.;Results of this study suggest that polymorphisms of the HER2 gene may be important susceptibility biomarkers for breast cancer risk, particularly among younger women.",

Forty, thirty-six, and twenty-three patients with lung, colon and breast cancer were included in this study, respectively. Serum levels of HER-2/neu, CA15.3, CA12-5, CA19-9, CEA, and AFP were measured. Her-2 neu levels were significantly higher in the breast cancer groups than colorectal and lung cancer and controls groups (P < 0.01). There is no significant difference when compared with others groups (P > 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the HER-2/neu and CA15-3 values in breast cancer groups. We found 0.75(0.59-0.90) for Her-2/neu from the area under the curve (AUC). P-value for breast cancer is 0.003, and we discovered that 9 ng/ml was the best inersection point. In this situation, we calculated that sensitivity was 65.2%, specificity was 100%, positive predictive value was 100%, negative predictive value 75.8%, and accuracy was 83.4%. These findings indicate that serum HER2/neu levels are clinically valuable in monitoring metastatic breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer patients. Prognosis of breast cancer provides an additional value over the commonly used CA15-3 test.

Moderate to strong (elevated) expression of Cox-2 protein was observed in 37.4% of the tumors, and it was associated with unfavorable distant disease-free survival (P < 0.0001). Elevated Cox-2 expression was associated with a large tumor size, a high histological grade, a negative hormone receptor status, a high proliferation rate (identified by Ki-67), high p53 expression, and the presence of HER-2 oncogene amplification (P < 0.0001 for all comparisons), along with axillary node metastases and a ductal type of histology (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0017, respectively).

We showed that trastuzumab treatment and its acquired resistance induced HER4 upregulation, cleavage and nuclear translocation. However, knockdown of HER4 by specific siRNAs increased trastuzumab sensitivity and reversed its resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer cells. Preventing HER4 cleavage by a γ-secretase inhibitor and inhibiting HER4 tyrosine kinase activity by neratinib decreased trastuzumab-induced HER4 nuclear translocation and enhanced trastuzumab response. There was also increased nuclear HER4 staining in the tumours from BT474 xenograft mice and human patients treated with trastuzumab. Furthermore, nuclear HER4 predicted poor clinical response to trastuzumab monotherapy in patients undergoing a window study and was shown to be an independent poor prognostic factor in HER2 positive breast cancer. Our data suggest that HER4 plays a key role in relation to trastuzumab resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer. Therefore, our study provides novel findings that HER4 activation, cleavage and nuclear translocation influence trastuzumab sensitivity and resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer.

        "Doc_abstract":"Metastasis, which remains incompletely characterized at the molecular and biochemical levels, is a highly specific process. Despite the ability of disseminated cancer cells to intravasate into distant tissues, it has been long recognized that only a limited subset of target organs develop clinically overt metastases. Therefore, subsequent adaptation of disseminated cancer cells to foreign tissue microenvironment determines the metastatic latency and tissue tropism of these cells. As a result, studying interactions between the disseminated cancer cells and the adjacent stromal cells will provide a better understanding of what constitutes a favorable or unfavorable microenvironment for disseminated cancer cells in a tissue-specific manner. Previously, we reported a protein signature of brain metastasis showing increased ability of brain metastatic breast cancer cells to counteract oxidative stress. In this study, we showed that another protein from the brain metastatic protein signature, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), has a dual function of regulating the metastatic growth of metastatic breast cancer cells and reducing the activation of immune response in the brain. More importantly, increased NT-3 secretion in metastatic breast cancer cells results in a reversion of mesenchymal-like (EMT) state to epithelial-like (MET) state and vice versa. Ectopic expression of NT-3 in EMT-like breast cancer cells reduces their migratory ability and increases the expression of HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and E-cadherin at the cell-cell junction. In addition, both endogenous and ectopic expression of NT-3 reduced the number of fully activated cytotoxic microglia. In summary, NT-3 appears to promote growth of metastatic breast cancer cells in the brain by facilitating the re-epithelialization of metastatic breast cancer cells and downmodulating the cytotoxic response of microglia. Most importantly, our results provide new insights into the latency and development of central nervous system macrometastases in patients with HER2-positive breast tumors and provide mechanistic rationale to target HER2 signaling for HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastasis.",

Because brain metastases from breast cancer occur in a variety of different clinical settings, ranging from a single metastasis without extensive extracranial disease to multiple brain metastases with widespread extracranial disease, treatment approaches must be tailored to the specific circumstances of each patient.

Analysis of this line revealed architectural differences in myofibrils of the distinct cardiomyocyte subtypes. We used this model to investigate the effects of Erbb2 signaling on myofibrillar organization because drugs targeting ERBB2 (HER2/NEU) signaling, a mainstay of breast cancer chemotherapy, cause dilated cardiomyopathy in many patients. High-resolution in vivo imaging revealed that Erbb2 signaling regulates a switch between a dense apical network of filamentous myofibrils and the assembly of basally localized myofibrils in ventricular cardiomyocytes.;Using this novel line, we compiled a reference for myofibrillar microarchitecture among myocardial subtypes in vivo and at different developmental stages, establishing this model as a tool to analyze in vivo cardiomyocyte contractility and remodeling for a broad range of cardiovascular questions. Furthermore, we applied this model to study Erbb2 signaling in cardiomyopathy.

To identify genetic factors modulating the response to HER2-targeted therapy, the numerical status of chromosome 17 was evaluated in HER2 gene-amplified tumor specimens from 43 patients who received trastuzumab-based treatment for advanced breast cancer, and in 60 unamplified breast carcinomas. Archival tumor specimens were analyzed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a centromeric probe for chromosome 17 simultaneously with the HER2/neu human gene-specific probe. In the 43 patients who received trastuzumab-based treatment, response rate and time to progression (TTP) were compared between subgroups according to chromosome 17 status. Numerical aberrations of chromosome 17 were found in 65% of HER2-amplified tumors (single centromeric signal, 44%; >3 centromeric signals, 21%) and 60% of unamplified cancers (single centromeric signal, 43%; >3 centromeric, 17%). In the 43 treated metastatic breast cancer patients, trastuzumab was combined with docetaxel (35 patients), paclitaxel (2 patients), or vinorelbine (6 patients). Response rate was 92% in patients with >2 centromeric signals (chromosome 17 eusomy/polysomy), and 53% in patients whose tumor showed a single signal (chromosome 17 monosomy) (p=0.005). Chromosome 17 numerical status was not found to affect TTP. Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that the effect of chromosome 17 monosomy on tumor response was independent of other potential clinical variables. Our findings suggest that 17 monosomy defines a subgroup of HER2 gene-amplified breast cancer characterized by reduced responsiveness to trastuzumab-based treatment. Further studies on the imbalance between the amplified HER2 gene and functionally antagonist gene(s) on chromosome 17 are warranted.",

Furthermore, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed and second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women. The current treatment armamentarium for breast cancer includes chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and biological therapy. Treatment has become more individualised based on characteristics of the tumour including overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2. Between 20 and 30% of all breast cancers overexpress HER2, which means 40,000 - 60,000 patients will have this type of cancer.Previously, overexpression of HER2 was a negative prognostic and predictive risk factor for survival; however, with the advent of trastuzumab, patients' prognosis is improving in all treatment settings. Much controversy exists in the use of trastuzumab, including (i) the sequence of adjuvant trastuzumab (concurrent with chemotherapy or sequential); (ii) the treatment duration (<1 year, 1 year or 2 years); and (iii) the treatment choice upon disease progression (whether to continue or not with trastuzumab and add another cytotoxic agent). Current trials are ongoing to help answer these questions.Furthermore, there has been interest in predicting which HER2-positive patients would require anthracycline therapy, and which could avoid anthracycline therapy and its toxicities. Novel therapeutics, such as lapatinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which blocks both the epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2 receptor has recently been approved by the US FDA.

Development of the CPS+EG staging system predated routine administration of trastuzumab in patients with ERBB2-positive disease (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu).;To validate the CPS+EG staging system using the new definition of ER positivity (≥1%) and to develop an updated staging system (Neo-Bioscore) that incorporates ERBB2 status into the previously developed CPS+EG.;Retrospective review of data collected prospectively from January 2005 through December 2012 on patients with breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.;Prognostic scores were computed using 2 versions of the CPS+EG staging system, one with ER considered positive if it measured 10% or higher, the other with ER considered positive if it measured 1% or higher. Fits of the Cox proportional hazards model for the 2 sets of prognostic scores were compared using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Status of ERBB2 was added to the model, and the likelihood ratio test was used to determine improvement in fit.;A total of 2377 patients were included; all were women (median age, 50 years [range, 21-87 years]); ER status was less than 1% in 28.9%, 1% to 9% in 8.3%, and 10% or higher in 62.8%; 591 patients were ERBB2 positive. Median follow-up was 4.2 years (range, 0.5-11.7 years). Five-year disease-specific survival was 89% (95% CI, 87%-90%). Using 1% or higher as the cutoff for ER positivity, 5-year disease-specific survival estimates determined using the CPS+EG stage ranged from 52% to 98%, thereby validating our previous finding that the CPS+EG score facilitates more refined categorization into prognostic subgroups than clinical or final pathologic stage alone. The AIC value for this model was 3333.06, while for a model using 10% or higher as the cutoff for ER positivity, it was 3333.38, indicating that the model fits were nearly identical. The improvement in fit of the model when ERBB2 status was added was highly significant, with 5-year disease-specific survival estimates ranging from 48% to 99% (P < .001).

As a general concept \"targeted drugs\" are effective only when the tumor exhibits the \"target\", which in breast cancer pathology may correspond to the expression of Estrogen Receptors and/or of HER2. These biomarkers are evaluated on breast cancer tissues by companion diagnostic tests, however, evidence suggests that the first step in breast cancer predictive pathology is still represented by morphology. For instance, histological types, such as tubular and cribriform carcinomas, define patients who may not need any treatments other than surgical excision. Neoadjuvant studies have shown that patients affected by lobular carcinomas are not likely to have any beneficial effects from chemotherapy. The second step in prediction is represented by immunophenotyping. If the immunohistochemical evaluation of four markers (estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER2 and Ki67) remains the best practice for breast cancer predictive pathology, molecular pathology has certainly reshaped the way we approach breast cancer diagnosis.

The overexpression of HER2 correlates strongly with prognosis in breast cancer. The targeted blockade of HER2 activity with monoclonal antibodies (e.g., trastuzumab [Herceptin]) and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., lapatinib) results in the inhibition of tumor growth in HER2-positive cancers. Anti-HER2 therapies have also shown efficacy in combination with chemotherapy in clinical trials in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Their efficacy may, however, be limited by molecular mechanisms that compensate for HER2 suppression (e.g., activity of EGF receptor) or mechanisms of resistance (e.g., loss of PTEN). HER2 continues, however, to be overexpressed by the cancer cells, and the continued suppression of HER2 may be required for maximum antitumor effect. It should be noted that in the absence of definitive data from randomized trials showing an absence or presence of benefit, the use of anti-HER2 agents such as trastuzumab in multiple sequential regimens has become the standard of care. Combining HER2 blockers with agents that overcome the compensatory or resistance mechanisms may increase the efficacy of anti-HER2 therapies.

Previous to this step and in order to validate the simulations, we have performed a detailed analysis of the variable antibody domain interactions with the extracellular domain IV of ErbB2. This structure has been statically elucidated by x-ray studies. Indeed, the simulation results are in excellent agreement with the available experimental information during the full trajectory. The PCA shows eigenvector fluctuations resulting in a hinge motion in which domain II and C(H) domains approach each other. This move is likely stabilized by the formation of H-bonds and salt bridge interactions between residues of the dimerization arm in the domain II and trastuzumab residues located in the C(H) domain. Finally, we discuss the flexibility of the MD/PCA model in relation with the static x-ray structure. A movement of the antibody toward the dimerization domain of the ErbB2 receptor is reported for the first time. This finding could have important consequences on the biological action of the monoclonal antibody.",

This is the first systematic review according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to synthesize all available data of pertuzumab in breast cancer. The search strategy retrieved 11 studies that evaluated pertuzumab. One study was conducted in the neoadjuvant setting (417 patients), whereas all the others dealt with patients with recurrent, metastatic, or refractory disease (1023 patients). Six studies were conducted in HER2(+) breast cancer population (1354 patients), whereas 5 studies (86 patients) were conducted in HER2(-) (or unknown HER2 status) disease. Pertuzumab is the most recent agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the treatment of patients with HER2(+) metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease. This approval has been based on data from a phase III Clinical Evaluation of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab (CLEOPATRA) study. The antitumor activity with the significant reduction in the risk of progression or death, as reflected upon the increase of 6.1 months in median progression-free survival, indicates that pertuzumab may provide an avenue for achieving additional benefit for patients with HER2(+). Moreover, pertuzumab seems to have a putative role in the management of patients with HER2 who are resistant to trastuzumab. The promising role of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings remains to be further investigated and established in the future. ",

Given the variability in clinical progression, the identification of markers that could predict the tumor behavior is particularly important in breast cancer. The determination of tumor markers is a useful tool for clinical management in cancer patients, assisting in diagnostic, staging, evaluation of therapeutic response, detection of recurrence and metastasis, and development of new treatment modalities. In this context, this review aims to discuss the main tumor markers in breast carcinogenesis. The most well-established breast molecular markers with prognostic and/or therapeutic value like hormone receptors, HER-2 oncogene, Ki-67, and p53 proteins, and the genes for hereditary breast cancer will be presented.

Thus, it is important to determine whether EP high-risk patients are or are not more sensitive to chemotherapy than low-risk patients. Here, we have assessed the EP predictive value for pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ER+/HER2- breast cancer. We gathered gene expression and histoclinical data of 553 pre-treatment ER+/HER2- breast carcinomas treated with anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We searched for correlation between the pathological complete response (pCR) and the EP score-based classification. The overall pCR rate was 12%. Fifty-one percent of samples were classified as low-risk according to the EP score and 49% as high-risk. EP classification was associated with a pCR rate of 7% in the low-risk group and 17% in the high-risk group (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, the EP score remained significantly associated with pCR. Many genes upregulated in the high-risk tumours were involved in cell proliferation, whereas many genes upregulated in the low-risk tumours were involved in ER-signalling and stroma. Despite higher chemosensitivity, the high-risk group was associated with worse disease-free survival. In conclusion, EP high-risk ER+/HER2- breast cancers are more likely to respond to anthracycline-based chemotherapy. ",

The lesion location provided by co-registered US was used to guide optical imaging. Light absorption was measured at two optical wavelengths. From this measurement, tumor angiogenesis was assessed on the basis of calculated THC. We investigated the relationships between maximum THC and clinicopathologic variables (tumor size [≤2 cm or >2 cm], metastasis to lymph node or distant organ, histologic grade, lymphovascular invasion, status of ER, PR, HER2 and Ki-67, and triple negativity). The mean maximum THC in the breast cancers was 223.3 ± 106.3 μmol/L. In univariate analysis, HER2 positivity, tumor size, and Ki-67 positivity showed significant correlations with maximum THC (p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis including tumor size, and ER, PR, HER2, and Ki-67 status, HER2 positivity correlated with maximum THC significantly (p = 0.007, parameter estimate 76.44).

        "Doc_abstract":"Overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) represents a biological subclass of breast cancer with distinct molecular alterations, clinical behavior, and response to systemic therapy. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against HER-2 which has revolutionized the management of both early and advanced breast cancer. It may exert its anti-cancer effects through inhibition of intracellular signaling, upregulation of p27, impaired angiogenesis, induction of immune-mediated destruction, and blockade of cleavage of the extracellular domain of HER-2. In spite of its robust clinical activity, most women with metastatic HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer eventually progress on trastuzumab therapy. Possible mechanisms of resistance include: altered receptor antibody interaction, PTEN loss and enhanced Akt signaling, p27 loss, signaling through other receptors. Preclinical experiments, clinical experience with the use of trastuzumab beyond progression, and a recent phase III clinical trial with Lapatinib, a dual EGFR/HER-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, demonstrate that the HER-2 signaling axis remains an important therapeutic target even after progression on trastuzumab. A variety of novel strategies are currently in development to exploit this pathway following the onset of resistance, such as receptor antibodies, sheddase inhibitors, signal transduction inhibitors, heat shock protein inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, and immune-stimulatory therapies, either as single agents or in combination with trastuzumab. Rational clinical trial design, with attention to appropriate patient selection and prospective collection of biological material, is needed to ensure that the new generation of anti-HER-2 targeted therapies realizes its promise in the treatment of trastuzumab-resistant disease.",

Gestational hypertension, preeclampsia/eclampsia, gestational diabetes, pregnancy weight gain, and nausea and vomiting (N&V) during pregnancy may be indicative of altered hormonal and metabolic profiles and could impact breast cancer risk. Here, we examined associations between these characteristics of a woman's pregnancy and her subsequent breast cancer risk. Participants were parous women that were recruited to a population-based case-control study (Western New York Exposures and Breast Cancer Study). Cases (n = 960), aged 35-79 years, had incident, primary, histologically confirmed breast cancer. Controls (n = 1,852) were randomly selected from motor vehicle records (< 65 years) or Medicare rolls (≥ 65 years). Women were queried on their lifetime pregnancy experiences. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). N&V during pregnancy was inversely associated with breast cancer risk. Relative to those who never experienced N&V, ever experiencing N&V was associated with decreased risk (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56-0.84) as were increased N&V severity (p trend < 0.001), longer duration (p trend < 0.01), and larger proportion of affected pregnancies (p trend < 0.0001) among women with ≥ 3 pregnancies. Associations were stronger for more recent pregnancies (< 5 years). Findings did not differ by menopausal status or breast cancer subtype including estrogen receptor and HER2 expression status. Other pregnancy characteristics examined were not associated with risk. We observed strong inverse associations between pregnancy N&V and breast cancer risk.

Recent reports have indicated the correlation between plasma coagulation parameters and clinical characteristics in breast cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of coagulation parameters in trastuzumab treated patients. Coagulation parameters from trastuzumab treated breast cancer patients were retrospectively studied from 2006 to 2010. The correlation between routine coagulation levels and clinical characteristics were analyzed, including prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen (Fib) and D-dimer (DD). The Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression hazard model were applied to assess their effect on prognosis. Totally 102 hospitalized breast cancer patients who received trastuzumab were collected and followed-up. All patients were HER-2 positive advanced breast cancer, with a median age of 45 years old. Extended PT, APTT, and TT were found in trastuzumab treatment non-effective group, as well as increased Fib and DD. But significant increase was only found in Fib. High Fib status (Fib > 2.88 g/L) was correlated with clinical characteristics, such as pathological grade, and reversely correlated with PTEN expression. More importantly, poor disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) to trastuzumab treatment were found in high Fib breast cancer patients. This retrospective study suggests high Fib status was correlated with poor treatment response to trastuzumab. Our findings indicated that Fib > 2.88 should alert physicians to consider a pretreatment for reducing Fib levels before trastuzumab treatment in HER-2 positive breast cancer patients.",

Members of both receptor classes are important prognostic factors in human breast cancer. Clinical data indicate that overexpression of the HER-2 gene is associated with an estrogen receptor-negative phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate that introduction of a HER-2 cDNA, converting non-overexpressing breast cancer cells to those which overexpress this receptor, results in development of estrogen-independent growth which is insensitive to both estrogen and the antiestrogen, tamoxifen. Moreover, activation of the HER-2 receptor in breast cancer cells by the peptide growth factor, heregulin, leads to direct and rapid phosphorylation of ER on tyrosine residues. This is followed by interaction between ER and the estrogen-response elements in the nucleus and production of an estrogen-induced protein, progesterone receptor. In addition, overexpression of HER-2 receptor in estrogen-dependent tumor cells promotes ligand-independent down-regulation of ER and a delayed autoregulatory suppression of ER transcripts. These data demonstrate a direct link between these two receptor pathways and suggest one mechanism for development of endocrine resistance in human breast cancers.",

Particularly, breast cancer in females places 1(st) rank among other types of cancers in term of cancer cases (23%) and death incidence (14%). Recent findings support the correlation between (Ile)655(Val) SNP in the HER2 gene with breast cancer risk. Moreover, the (Ile)655(Val) HER2 gene polymorphism could be a predictive factor in a neoadjuvant therapy setting. Precise detection of the (Ile)655(Val) HER2 gene SNP in early breast cancer patients will be beneficial in designing the most suitable treatment and in increasing the efficacy of anticancer drugs. Here we develop a rapid and inexpensive method for (Ile)655(Val) SNP detection in the HER2 gene based on allele-specific PCR technology. Two forward primers and one common reverse primer were designed to anneal specifically either on the HER2 gene fragment containing the GG genotype or to the HER2 gene fragment containing the AA genotype where one of these primers had been added with poly-GC at 5' upstream. Moreover, to increase discrimination level, mismatch bases at the SNP site and the 3(rd) base of each forward primers from 3'end were added. To test the performance of the designed primers in discriminating a polymorphism and its annealing temperature, breast cancer specimen-derived genomic DNA (with GG genotype) and pGEM_HER2/AA (with AA genotype) were used as templates in the PCR reaction. The optimal annealing temperature for SNP detection was at 51.5°C as showed by the appearance of a 150 base pair (bp) band as AA genotype (pGEM_HER2/AA template), 116bp band as GG genotype (genomic DNA template), and both types of bands as AG genotype (mix of pGEM_HER2/AA and genomic DNA template). Allelic types of breast cancer patients were also determined using this optimized method compared to sanger sequencing. The 100% accordance was shown for all types of genotypes in both methods. The allele-specific PCR in this study may have application in determining polymorphisms of the breast cancers-originated (Ile)655(Val) HER2 gene.",

Breast cancers are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous. Each of the three major subtypes [ERBB2 amplified, estrogen receptor (ESR)-positive and triple-negative] poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Here we show, using high-resolution next-generation transcriptome sequencing, that in all three breast cancer subtypes, but not matched controls, there was significant overexpression of transcripts from intronic and untranslated regions in addition to exons from specific genes, particularly amplified oncogenes and hormone receptors. For key genes ERBB2 and ESR1, we demonstrate that overexpression is linked to the production of highly modified and truncated splice variants in tumours, but not controls, correlated with tumour subtype. Translation of these tumour-specific splice variants generates truncated proteins with altered subcellular locations and functions, modifying the phenotype, affecting tumour biology, and targeted antitumour therapies. In contrast, tumour suppressors TP53, BRCA1/2 and NF1 did not show intronic overexpression or truncated splice variants in cancers.

Conventional chemotherapy is currently the only treatment option, thus there is a critical need to find new and effective targeted therapies in this disease. While investigation of agents such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and EGFR inhibitors continues, results from recent clinical trials indicate that these therapies are not as active in sporadic triple negative breast cancers as initially hoped. It is important therefore to consider other emerging therapeutic agents. Mutation in p53 is found in the vast majority of triple negative breast cancers, and as such is a target of particular interest.

The antibodies demonstrated differing effects on alpha6beta4-mediated cellular adhesion, highlighting the existence of different functional epitopes on alpha6beta4. Interestingly however both antibodies blocked adhesion-independent growth in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Antibody induced apoptosis and inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling were also observed within the context of matrix adhesion. Enhanced inhibitory effects were observed when the alpha6beta4 antibodies were used in combination with antibodies to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or erythoblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ErbB2).

The prognosis of metachronous bilateral cancer, especially those diagnosed within 2 years after the first cancer was significantly worse than synchronous bilateral cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Previous studies showed the prognostic and predictive impact of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) gene alterations analyzed separately and jointly with topoisomerase II α (TOP2A) gene alterations; however, the role of TOP2A gene abnormalities alone has not been thoroughly investigated. Additionally, TOP2A aberrations were typically studied in HER-2-positive (HER-2(+)) tumors because these genes are frequently coamplified. Therefore, the knowledge concerning the impact of TOP2A abnormalities in HER-2-negative (HER-2(-)) patients is scarce. This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of TOP2A anomalies in breast cancer patients with HER-2(-) and HER-2(+) tumors.;Snap-frozen tumor samples from 322 consecutive stage I-III breast cancer patients were analyzed for TOP2A gene dosage using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).;A high TOP2A gene dosage was found in 94 tumors (29%)-32% and 27% of HER-2(+) and HER-2(-) tumors, respectively. The mean TOP2A gene dosages in the HER-2(+) and HER-2(-) groups were 1.49 ± 1.03 and 1.09 ± 0.35, respectively. High TOP2A gene dosage had an inverse prognostic impact in terms of shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) times in the entire group and in both the HER-2(-) and HER-2(+) subgroups. The unfavorable prognostic impact of TOP2A gene dosage was maintained in the multivariate Cox regression analysis in the entire group and in HER-2(-) patients.;A high gene dosage of TOP2A determined using qPCR occurs frequently both in HER-2(+) and HER-2(-) tumors and has a strong adverse prognostic impact.",

Gadd45a has been shown to serve as an effector in oncogenic stress in breast carcinogenesis in murine models. The present study was aimed at clarifying the expression of Gadd45a in human breast cancer and its correlation with clinicopathologic features.;The expression levels of Gadd45a in breast tissue samples of female breast surgery cases were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a Gadd45a antibody. Percent staining was determined and statistical analyses were applied to determine prognostic correlations.;56 female breast surgery cases were studied: Normal (11), Luminal A (9), Luminal B (11), HER2+ (10), Triple Negative (15). There was a highly significant difference in percent Gadd45a staining between groups [Mean]: Normal 16.3%; Luminal A 65.3%; Luminal B 80.7%; HER2+ 40.5%; TN 32%, P < 0.001, ANOVA. Gadd45a IHC levels for Normal cases found 82% negative/low. Luminal A breast cancer cases were found to be 67% high. Luminal B breast cancers were 100% high. Her2+ cases were 50% negative/low. Triple Negative cases were 67% negative/low. This difference in distribution of Gadd45a levels across breast cancer receptor subtypes was significant, P = 0.0009.;Gadd45a levels are significantly associated with hormone receptor status in human breast cancer. Normal breast tissue displays low Gadd45a levels. High Gadd45a levels are associated with Luminal A and Luminal B subtypes. Absence of hormone receptors in Triple Negative subtype is associated with Negative/Low levels of Gadd45a. Further studies are indicated to elucidate the role of Gadd45a in breast cancer as a potential prognosticator or target for treatment.",
