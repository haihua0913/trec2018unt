Targeting ErbBs by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may therefore limit esophageal cancer cell migration. Here, we studied the impact of TKIs on ErbB dimerization, cell signaling pathways, and cell migration in three esophageal cell lines: OE21 (ESCC), OE33 (EAC), and Het-1A (non-neoplastic esophageal epithelium). In OE21 cells, the TKIs erlotinib, gefitinib, and lapatinib slightly affected epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR/EGFR, but not EGFR/HER2 dimerization as detected by in situ proximity ligation assay (in situ PLA). Still, TKIs inhibited ERK1/2, Akt, STAT3, and RhoA activity in OE21 cells, as assessed by Western blot, antibody arrays, and Rho GTPase effector pull-down assays. This was accompanied by reduced OE21 cell migration, induction of focal adhesions, and actin cytoskeleton reorganization, as shown by Oris™ migration assay and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/phalloidin staining. In contrast, in OE33 cells, only lapatinib decreased STAT5, Src family kinase (SFK), and FAK activity as well as β-catenin expression. This impeded cell migration and induced morphological changes in OE33 cells. No alterations were seen for the non-neoplastic Het-1A cells. Thus, we identified the ErbB signaling network as regulator of esophageal cancer cell's actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesions, and cell migration. ErbB targeted TKIs therefore also limit ESCC and EAC cell motility and migration.;Clinical tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) reduce esophageal cancer cell migration. Loss of cell migration is linked to reduced Akt, ERK1/2, STAT (3 or 5), FAK, SFKs, and RhoA activity. Clinical TKIs act via distinct signaling in the two main histotypes of esophageal cancer.",

Our study addressed the role of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 expression and dimerization in esophageal cancers in situ and in vitro in the context of therapeutic EGFR and HER2 inhibitors. In archival pretreatment biopsies of esophageal carcinomas (n = 110), EGFR was preferentially expressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) (22.4%; p = 0.088) and HER2 (34.4%; p < 0.001) with HER3 (91.5%; p < 0.001) in esophageal (Barrett's) adenocarcinomas (EACs). In situ proximity ligation assays revealed mainly EGFR and HER2 homodimers in ESCC and EAC cases, respectively. However, EAC cases also exhibited HER2/HER3 heterodimers. In vitro ESCC (OE21) cells displayed a significant response to erlotinib, gefitinib and lapatinib, with loss of AKT phosphorylation, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. In EAC cells (OE19, OE33 and SK-GT-4), lapatinib was similarly effective in strongly HER2-positive (mainly HER2 homodimers and some HER2/EGFR heterodimers) OE19 and OE33 cells. The HER2-targeting antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab) given alone were largely ineffective in ESCC and EAC cells. However, both antibodies significantly induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in EAC (OE19 and OE33) cells upon co-culture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The study reveals that overexpression of EGFR and HER2 predominantly results in homodimers in ESCCs and EACs, respectively. Still, some EACs also show HER2 dimerization plasticity, e.g., with HER3. Such RTK dimerization patterns affect responses to EGFR and HER2 targeting inhibitors in ESCC and EAC cells in vitro and hence may influence future prediction for particularly HER2-targeting inhibitors in EACs.",

We found that CI-1033 could inhibit the growth of esophageal cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner with the inhibition of phosphorylation of both MAPK and AKT. The oral administration of CI-1033 exerted a significant antitumor effect on esophageal cancer tumors in athymic nude mice. Our results suggest that CI-1033 effectively inhibits the growth of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma which co-expresses both EGFR and HER2 with the inhibition of phosphorylation of both MAPK and AKT.

This study was to evaluate antitumor activity of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE, a recently developed bispecific enediyne-energized fusion protein targeting both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), on esophageal cancer. The fusion protein Ec-LDP-Hr-AE consists of two oligopeptide ligands and an enediyne antibiotic lidamycin (LDM) for receptor binding and cell killing, respectively. The current study demonstrated that Ec-LDP-Hr had high affinity to bind to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells, and enediyne-energized fusion protein Ec-LDP-Hr-AE showed potent cytotoxicity to ESCC cells with differential expression of EGFR and HER2. Ec-LDP-Hr-AE could cause significant G2-M arrest in EC9706 and KYSE150 cells, and it also induced apoptosis in ESCC cells in a dosage-dependent manner. Western blot assays showed that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE promoted caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities as well as PARP cleavage. Moreover, Ec-LDP-Hr-AE inhibited cell proliferation via decreasing phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2, and further exerted inhibition of the activation of their downstream signaling molecules. In vivo, at a tolerated dose, Ec-LDP-Hr-AE inhibited tumor growth by 88% when it was administered to nude mice bearing human ESCC cell KYSE150 xenografts. These results indicated that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE exhibited potent anti-caner efficacy on ESCC, suggesting it could be a promising candidate for targeted therapy of esophageal cancer. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in esophageal carcinoma and its precursor lesions. To gain insights into how EGFR overexpression affects cellular functions in primary human esophageal cells, we performed gene expression profiling and identified insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-3 as the most up-regulated gene. IGFBP-3 regulates cell proliferation through both insulin-like growth factor-dependent and independent mechanisms. We found that IGFBP-3 mRNA and protein expression was increased in EGFR-overexpressing primary and immortalized human esophageal cells. IGFBP-3 was also up-regulated in EGFR-overexpressing cells in organotypic culture and in EGFR transgenic mice. Furthermore, IGFBP-3 mRNA was overexpressed in 80% of primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and 60% of primary esophageal adenocarcinomas. Concomitant up-regulation of EGFR and IGFBP-3 was observed in 60% of primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry revealed cytoplasmic localization of IGFBP-3 in the preponderance of preneoplastic and neoplastic esophageal lesions. IGFBP-3 was also overexpressed in esophageal cancer cell lines at both mRNA (60%) and protein (40%) levels. IGFBP-3 secreted by cancer cells was capable of binding to insulin-like growth factor I. Functionally, epidermal growth factor appeared to regulate IGFBP-3 expression in esophageal cancer cell lines. Finally, suppression of IGFBP-3 by small interfering RNA augmented cell proliferation, suggesting that IGFBP-3 may inhibit tumor cell proliferation as a negative feedback mechanism. In aggregate, we have identified for the first time that IGFBP-3 is an aberrantly regulated gene through the EGFR signaling pathway and it may modulate EGFR effects during carcinogenesis.",

We evaluated the antitumor             effects of lapatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor which simultaneously inhibits             EGFR and HER2, 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) alone and in combination on esophageal cancer             cells. The antiproliferative activity of lapatinib, 5-Fu and lapatinib plus 5-Fu             was measured by MTT assay and the combination index (CI) values were calculated.             Additionally, cell cycle distribution of lapatinib alone and the combination with             5-Fu were detected by flow cytometry analysis. Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide             stain were used for analyzing the apoptotic cells after cells were treated with             either agent alone or in combination. The EGFR and HER2 activated signaling pathways             were monitored by western blotting. The combination of lapatinib and 5-Fu synergistically             inhibited cell proliferation and exhibited an enhanced proapoptotic effect on             esophageal cancer cells. The potentiation effect of combined treatment was associated             with downregulation of EGFR and HER2 signaling pathways because data from western             blot analysis showed that lapatinib in combination with 5-Fu markedly reduced             the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2, and inhibited the activation of downstream             signaling molecules, such as AKT and ERK. A significant G1 arrest was also observed             in cell cycle analysis after exposing cells to lapatinib, however, combination             with 5-Fu did not enhance G1 arrest.

KRAS mutations in codons 12, 13 were detected by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products. The correlations between clinicopathological features and the mutation status of EGFR and KRAS were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. In the present study, EGFR mutations were found in 7 (14%) out of 50 patients, including G719X missense mutation (n= 1), in-frame deletion (n= 2), and L858R missense mutation (n= 5). Six (12%) out of 50 patients had KRAS mutations in codon 12. Concurrent EGFR and KRAS mutations were detected in one sample. The presences of EGFR and KRAS mutations were not associated with gender, age, smoking history, cell differentiation, or cancer stage. In conclusion, the incidence of EGFR mutations in Chinese patients with ESCC was higher than that of previous reports, and the incidence of KRAS mutations was not low.

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of Nimotuzumab (an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody) on ESCC radiotherapy (RT) and underlying mechanisms.;Nimotuzumab was administrated to 2 ESCC cell lines KYSE30 and TE-1 treated with RT. Cell growth, colony formation and apoptosis were used to measure anti-proliferation effects. The method of RNA interference was used to investigate the role of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) in ESCC cells radiosensitivity treated with Nimotuzumab. In vivo effect of Nimotuzumab on ESCC radiotherapy was done using a mouse xenograft model.;Nimotuzumab enhanced radiation response of KYSE30 cells (with high EGFR expression) in vitro, as evidenced by increased radiation-inhibited cell growth and colony formation and radiation-mediated apoptosis. Mechanism study revealed that Nimotuzumab inhibited phosphorylated EGFR (p-EGFR) induced by EGF in KYSE30 cells. In addition, knockdown of IGFBP-3 by short hairpin RNA significantly reduced KYSE30 cells radiosensitivity (P<0.05), and even after the administration of Nimotuzumab, the RT response of IGFBP-3 silenced KYSE30 cells was not enhanced (P>0.05). In KYSE30 cell xenografts, Nimotuzumab combined with radiation led to significant tumor growth delay, compared with that of radiation alone (P=0.029), and also with IGFBP-3 up-regulation in tumor tissue.;Nimotuzumab could enhance the RT effect of ESCC cells with a functional active EGFR pathway. In particular, the increased ESCC radiosensitivity by Nimotuzumab might be dependent on the up-regulation of IGFBP-3 through EGFR-dependent pathway.",

Expression of EGFR and phosphorylated proteins associated with EGFR signaling pathway, i.e. p-Akt and p-Erk, were assessed with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for all patients. Correlations between these proteins' expression levels and overall survival (OS) were assessed.High expression of EGFR, p-Akt and p-Erk was detected in 53.1% (17/32), 54.8% (17/31) and 59.4% (19/32) of tumors respectively. No significant differences in OS were found between high EGFR, p-Akt and p-Erk expression groups and their respective counterparts. Of note, significantly better overall survival was observed in patients with coexistence of high EGFR expression and low p-Akt expression (p = 0.030).Our data allowed us to put forward a hypothesis that high EGFR and low p-Akt expression may predict a clinical benefit of EGFR antagonists such as nimotuzumab combined with RT or CRT. This can be discussed in the terms of oncogene addiction and synthetic lethality concepts. This hypothesis can be further tested in larger groups of patients. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Wnt signaling is an important evolutionary conserved pathway that is not only involved in determination of cellular development, self-renewal, and fate, but also has significant roles in tumor development and progression. Deregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and aberrant expression of its components is commonly observed in solid tumors. Such aberrant regulation of Wnt signaling is commonly related to either malfunction of its components or crosstalk with other cellular processes such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling cascade. Therefore, identification of the roles of major involved components may be useful to identify new therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. In this study, we assessed EGFR and PYGO2 mRNA expression in tumors and margin normal tissues from 55 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients using real-time qRT-PCR, and evaluated clinicopathology relative to the two genes' expression levels. Significant PYGO2 and EGFR overexpression was observed in 30.9 % (P = 0.017) and 38.2 % (P = 0.006) of tumors, respectively. PYGO2 and EGFR expression were significantly associated not only with each other (P < 0.001), but also with tumor staging and depth (P < 0.001). Furthermore, PYGO2 expression was significantly correlated with the tumor grade (P = 0.043) and size (P = 0.023). We identify PYGO2 as a new molecular marker of invasive tumors, introducing its probable oncogenic role in ESCC progression and aggressiveness. In line with other reports, we also illustrate the oncogenic function of EGFR in the development of ESCC through advance stages. We also observed a significant correlation between PYGO2 and EGFR in ESCC tumors, which reveals a mutual convergent influence of these factors in tumor progression and development. Considering aberrant expression, mutual positive feedback, and the significant clinical relevance of these genes in ESCC, we introduce them as appropriate therapeutic targets in adjuvant therapy of ESCC.",

The long-term survival of patients with this cancer remains poor; only 25% of patients undergoing surgical excision are alive after 5 years. Multimodal programs that incorporate radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery for localized tumors may result in a modest survival advantage. However, significant strides in this disease can result from the inclusion of targeted therapies. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family represents one such target and is receiving increasing attention due to the advent of specific inhibitors. Studies conducted by us and others have shown that the overexpression of EGFR family signaling intermediates is common in Barrett's esophagus and EAC. In the latter case, EGFR expression may have prognostic significance. EGFR inhibitors, including oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, result in a synergistic antitumor effect with chemotherapeutic agents or with radiotherapy. Therefore, several ongoing studies include EGFR-directed therapy either alone or in combination with chemoradiotherapy for this disease. Our study of gefitinib, oxaliplatin and radiotherapy suggested that gefitinib can be safely incorporated into an oxaliplatin-based chemoradiation program for esophageal cancer, although the clinical activity of this combination is modest.

We also examined the association between EGFR overexpression and the efficacy of a novel EGFR TKI, icotinib, in 62 ESCC patients.Of the 193 patients, 95 (49.2%) patients showed EGFR overexpression (3+), and 47(24.4%) patients harbored EGFR FISH positivity. EGFR overexpression was significantly correlated with clinical stage and lymph node metastasis (p<0.05). In addition, EGFR overexpression was significantly correlated with EGFR FISH positivity (p<0.001). Among the 62 patients who received icotinib, the response rate was 17.6% for patients with high EGFR-expressing tumors, which was markedly higher than the rate (0%) for patients with low to moderate EGFR-expressing tumors (p=0.341). Furthermore, all cases responded to icotinib showed EGFR overexpression.In conclusion, our study suggests that EGFR overexpression might potentially be used in predicting the efficacy in patients treated with Icotinib. These data have implications for both clinical trial design and therapeutic strategies. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"There exists a highly tumorigenic subset of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells defined by high expression of CD44. A novel therapy targeting these cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) is needed to improve prognosis of ESCC. CSCs of ESCC have a mesenchymal phenotype and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical to enrich and maintain CSCs. EGFR, frequently overexpressed in ESCC, has pivotal roles in EMT induced by TGF-β in invasive fronts. Thus, EMT in invasive fronts of ESCC might be important for CSCs and EGFR could be a target of a novel therapy eliminating CSCs. However, effects of EGFR inhibitors on CSCs in ESCC have not been fully examined. EGFR inhibitors, erlotinib and cetuximab, significantly suppressed enrichment of CSCs via TGF-β1-mediated EMT. Importantly, EGFR inhibitors sharply suppressed ZEB1 that is essential for EMT in ESCC. Further, EGFR inhibitors activated Notch1 and Notch3, leading to squamous cell differentiation. EGFR inhibition may suppress expression of ZEB1 and induce differentiation, thereby blocking EMT-mediated enrichment of CSCs. In organotypic 3D culture, a form of human tissue engineering, tumor cells in invasive nests showed high expression of CD44. Erlotinib significantly blocked invasion into the matrix and CD44 high expressing CSCs were markedly suppressed by erlotinib in organotypic 3D culture. In conclusion, EMT is a critical process for generation of CSCs and the invasive front of ESCC, where EMT occurs, might form a CSC niche in ESCC. EGFR inhibitors could suppress EMT in invasive fronts and be one therapeutic option targeting against generation of CSCs in ESCC. ",

Production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in response to treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). COX-2 protein and VEGF protein were measured by immunoblot analysis, and COX-2 activity was measured by ELISA. In vivo, CDCA was administered to ESCC cell-bearing mice. Tumor tissues were analyzed immunohistochemically, and microvessel density was evaluated. Clinically, 134 patients with ESCC who underwent esophagectomy were studied. In vitro, CDCA induced the production of PGE2 and VEGF in dose- and time-dependent manners, and these effects were attenuated by a selective COX-2 inhibitor, mitogen-activated protein kinases inhibitor, or epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor. CDCA-induced COX-2 in the cell lysate increased the secretion of VEGF into the culture medium. In vivo, CDCA markedly enhanced tumor growth and increased vascularization. Clinically, patients whose tumors expressed both COX-2 and VEGF had poor outcomes.

Amplification (>4 copies) of at least 1 of the loci was observed in 14% of high-grade dysplasia and increased to 50% in esophageal adenocarcinoma (P = 0.015). The most frequently amplified locus was c-myc (18%), followed by 20q13 (13%) and EGFR (11%) in the high-grade dysplasia/esophageal adenocarcinoma cases. High amplification levels (>10 copies) of the loci were more frequent in esophageal adenocarcinoma (72%) compared with high-grade dysplasia (20%; P = 0.049). Amplifications of the c-myc, EGFR, and 20q12 loci may serve as diagnostic markers to identify patients with Barrett's esophagus with high-grade dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma. Gains of the loci might be of value as prognostic markers because they are already present in nondysplasia cases and may precede the later event of the amplification as observed in high-grade dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate invasion- and metastasis-related genes in esophageal carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo.;A metastasis model using a Matrigel invasion clonal selection approach was employed to establish a highly invasive subline EC9706-P4 from the esophageal carcinoma cell (ESCC) line EC9706. The differentially expressed genes of the subline and the parental cells determined by gene microarrays were further analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blotting.;We identified sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) as an invasion and metastasis-related gene of esophageal cancer. SPHK1 was overexpressed in the EC9706-P4 subline with high invasive capacity. Among six ESCC lines tested, KYSE2 and KYSE30 cells showed the highest SPHK1 mRNA and protein expressions as well as the most invasive phenotype. By Western blotting, in 7/12 cases (58%), SPHK1 expression was higher in esophageal carcinomas than in the companion normal tissue. In 23/30 cases (76%), SPHK1 protein expression was upregulated in the tumors compared to matched normal tissue by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Esophageal carcinoma tissue microarray analysis indicated that SPHK1 expression correlated with the depth of tumor invasion (P < 0.0001) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.016). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, strong SPHK1 expression was significantly associated with clinical failure (P < 0.01), suggesting the involvement of SPHK1 in aggressiveness of human esophageal carcinoma. SPHK1 overexpression significantly increased the invasiveness of EC9706 cells in vitro and also increased EC9706 cell growth and spontaneous metastasis in vivo, promoting significant increases in tumor growth, tumor burden and spontaneous lung metastasis in nude mice. SPHK1 expression significantly correlated with the expression of many EGFR pathway genes associated with invasion of cancer cells. SPHK1 protein expression also significantly correlated with the phosphorylation of EGFR.;In summary, our data implicate SPHK1 in the metastasis of esophageal cancer. Our study also identified downstream mediators of SPHK1 in esophageal cancer cells that may mediate enhanced malignant behavior, and several of these mediators may be useful as therapeutic targets.",

In this study, we examined the antitumor effect of gefitinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, against ESCC cells in vitro and in vivo. In three ESCC cell lines (TE8, T.T and T.Tn), cell proliferation had been inhibited in a dose-dependent manner and IC(50) values (respectively, 8.49, 18.9 and 17.3muM). Gefitinib inhibited EGF-induced autophosphorylation of EGFR and its downstream signaling pathways, Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/Akt, and caused G(1) arrest of cell cycle and apoptosis confirmed with flow cytometry. We examined the effect of gefitinib on nude mice bearing established TE8 and T.T xenografts. Gefitinib (100 or 200mg/kg once-daily, p.o.) showed antitumor activity in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in a significantly improved survival of treated mice as compared with untreated mice. Immunohistochemical examination of the harvested tumor was performed to examine the status of phosphorylated EGFR, PCNA, Factor VIII and apoptosis. We found inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation, cell cycle arrest (by PCNA staining), decrease of microvessel density (Factor VIII) and induction of apoptosis by TUNEL staining.

We review six aspects of the research literature on esophageal cancer: epidemiology and etiology, epidermal growth factor receptor and related growth factor receptors, cell cycle regulatory proteins, transforming growth factor-beta/Smad proteins, mismatch repair genes, and other genes. This article provides a conceptual basis for evaluating studies on the molecular mechanism of esophageal carcinogenesis and for devising therapeutic and preventive strategies based on molecular biology. We hope that in the near future, the clinical outcome of patients with esophageal carcinoma will be improved by a better understanding of the basic mechanisms of carcinogenesis.",

Other investigations suggest increases in EGFR copy number are associated with poor prognosis in EC, but have used a variety of different techniques and tested numbers remain small. A validated assay for EGFR copy number in EC is needed, to allow investigation of EGFR copy number gain as a predictive biomarker for the anti-EGFR responsive subgroup of patients. We developed a scoring system in EC based upon established systems for EGFR fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) in lung cancer, and applied this in a series of 160 UK patients with advanced EC.;Dual colour FISH on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies were scored independently by two operators as: disomy (score = 1), low trisomy (score = 2), high trisomy (score = 3), low polysomy (score = 4), high polysomy (score = 5) and amplification (score = 6). EGFR FISH positive cases (scores 5 and 6) were found in 32/160 (20 %) tumours, with high polysomy in 22 (13.8 %) and amplification in 10 (6.3 %). Two independent operator scores for FISH positivity were 100 % concordant. EGFR FISH positive status was not associated with clinic-pathological features. EGFR amplification was associated with worse survival (HR = 2.64, 95 % CI 1.04 to 6.71, p = 0.03).;Our FISH scoring system for EGFR in advanced EC identifies a significant subgroup (20.0 %) of FISH positive patients. EGFR amplification, which is found in 6.3 %, is associated with poor survival. It is not known if there is a role for EGFR targeted treatment in this subgroup of patients, however we are now utilising this EGFR FISH assay and scoring system in biopsies from clinical trials utilising anti-EGFR targeted therapies.",

The Cox proportional hazards model was used in multivariate analysis to identify independent prognostic factors. The low-dose and high-dose groups comprised 55 and eleven patients, respectively. The median follow-up time in the final analysis was 46 months. The high-dose group showed no increased incidence of toxicities compared to the low-dose group.

Restoration of RAR-beta(2) inhibited growth and colony formation of esophageal cancer cells, which was correlated with COX-2 suppression. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms for RAR-beta(2)-mediated suppression of COX-2 expression using BPDE as a tool. We found that BPDE-induced COX-2 expression was through inhibition of RAR-beta(2) and consequently, induction of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation, and c-Jun expression. Esophageal cancer cells that do not express RAR-beta(2) did not respond to BPDE for induction of COX-2. BPDE was also unable to induce COX-2 expression after RAR-beta(2) expression was manipulated in these esophageal cancer cells. Furthermore, BPDE induced time-dependent methylation of RAR-beta(2) gene promoter in esophageal cancer cells. Transfection of RAR-beta(2) expression vector into esophageal cancer cells suppressed expression of EGFR, Erk1/2 phosphorylation, c-Jun, and COX-2. In addition, co-treatment of RAR-beta(2)-positive cells with BPDE and the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 caused little change in c-Jun and COX-2 expression. This study demonstrated that BPDE-suppressed expression of RAR-beta(2) results in COX-2 induction and restoration of RAR-beta(2) expression reduces COX-2 protein in esophageal cancer cells, thereby further supporting our previous finding that RAR-beta(2) plays an important role in suppressing esophageal carcinogenesis.",

Given recent reports of TKI-responsive cases of esophageal and pancreatic cancer, this study was designed to determine the prevalence of EGFR mutations in these gastrointestinal cancers.;We sequenced exons 18 to 21 of EGFR from 21 cases of Barrett's esophagus, 5 cases of high-grade esophageal dysplasia, 17 cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma, and 55 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Subsets of esophageal (n = 7) and pancreatic cancer cases (n = 5) were obtained from patients who were subsequently treated with gefitinib or erlotinib-capecitabine, respectively.;Mutations of EGFR were identified in two esophageal cancers (11.7%), three cases of Barrett's esophagus (14.2%), and two pancreatic cancers (3.6%). The mutations consisted of the recurrent missense L858R and in-frame deletion delE746-A750, previously characterized as activating EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung cancer. We also identified the TKI drug resistance-associated EGFR T790M mutation in an untreated case of Barrett's esophagus and the corresponding adenocarcinoma.;The presence of activating mutations within EGFR in both esophageal and pancreatic adenocarcinomas defines a previously unrecognized subset of gastrointestinal tumors in which EGFR signaling may play an important biological role.

Still, 7% of the tumors presented at least a 25-fold higher expression of this gene when compared to its paired counterpart. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 21% of the tumors were positive for HER2 (scores 2+ and 3+), although only 3+ tumors presented amplification of this gene. Mutation analysis for EGFR (exons 18-21), KRAS (codons 12 and 13) and BRAF (V600E) showed no mutations in any of the hotspots of these genes in almost 100 patients analyzed.

In this study, we investigated acquaporin-8 expression and signaling via epidermal growth factor receptor-extracellular signal-regulated kinases1/2 in human esophageal cancer Eca-109 cells by western blot, immunofluorescence and wound healing (scratch) assays. Our results showed that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced both Eca-109 migration and AQP8 expression.

AQP8 expression was significantly increased (1.19-fold) at 48 h after EGF treatment in Eca-109. The EGFR kinase inhibitor, PD153035, blocked EGF-induced AQP8 expression and cell migration. AQP8 expression was decreased from 3.65-fold (EGF-treated) to 0.55-fold (PD153035-treated) in Eca-109.

The 2-year overall survival rate of patients expressing high levels of MIB-1 was 71% (±17%) compared with 0% (P=0.019) for those expressing low levels. For NF-κB, the rate was 0% for patients with high levels compared with 100% (P<0.018) for those with low levels. The 2-year local control rates of HER2/neu were 0% in patients expressing high levels and 88% (±12%) in patients expressing low levels (P=0.027). The 2-year disease-free survival rates of HER2/neu and ER were 0% for patients expressing high levels compared with 56% (±17%) for those with low levels (P=0.027). There were no significant correlations between the expression levels of the other proteins and clinical outcomes. In the present study, high levels of MIB-1 and low levels of NF-κB, HER2 and ER were shown to be good prognostic factors following definitive CCRT for ESCC.",

All of the 39 cases were found to express EGFR, but the expression levels were not significantly higher than those in basal cells of the normal esophageal epithelium. In 38 of the 39 cases, alpha-p-EGFR(Tyr992) immunoreactivity was evident. Interestingly, the positively stained carcinoma cells were not distributed diffusely, and strongly immunostained cells tended to be localized in areas of severe dysplasia and in microinvasive foci just adjacent to the main invasive carcinoma.

The candidate proteins include p53, EGFR, c-KIT, TIMP1 and PI3K-p110α reported to be altered in ESCC tissues as well as another important component of PI3K, PI3K-p85α. Of the six proteins tested, p53, EGFR, c-KIT, TIMP1 and PI3K-p85α were detected with high expression in 43.0%, 36.6%, 55.9%, 70.7% and 57.1% of tumors, respectively. Significant associations were found between high expression of PI3K-p85α, EGFR and p53 and poor prognosis (P = 0.00111; 0.00001; 0.00426). Applying these three proteins as an IHC panel could divide patients into different subgroups (P<0.000001). Multivariate cox regression analysis indicated that the three-protein panel was an independent prognostic factor with very high statistical significance (HR = 2.090, 95% CI: 1.621-2.696, P = 0.00000001).

Several prognostic biomarkers have been proposed, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The aim of this study was to assess whether EGFR expression predicts EA staging and patient survival. Methods. In this historical cohort, consecutive patients with EA managed between 2000 and 2010 were considered eligible for the study. Surgical specimens of patients treated with transhiatal esophagectomy were evaluated to establish EGFR expression and tumor differentiation. Staging was classified according with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system. Survival was determined according to either medical register or patient's family contact. Results. Thirty-seven patients who underwent esophagectomy without presurgical chemotherapy or radiotherapy were studied. EGFR expression was found in 16 patients (43%). EGFR expression was more frequent as higher was the TNM (I and II = 0% versus III = 47% versus IV = 100%; P < 0.001). Average survival in months was significantly shorter in the group of patients with EGFR expression (10.5 versus 21.7; P = 0.001). Conclusions. In patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with transhiatal esophagectomy, EGFR expression was related to higher TNM staging and shorter survival.

The definitive CCRT consisted of a median dose of 54 Gy (range: 40.0-68.4 Gy) and two cycles of concurrent administration of mostly 5-fluorouracil + cisplatinum. High expression of EGFR, VEGF, and COX-2 was found in 79.5%, 31.8%, and 38.6%, respectively. The Cox regression analysis for overall survival (OS) showed that both the treatment response and COX-2 expression were significant. The 3-yr OS rates of patients that achieved a complete response and those that did not were 46.7% and 5.3%, respectively (P = 0.006). The logistic regression analysis for treatment response with various parameters showed that only a high expression of VEGF was significantly associated with a complete response. Unlike other well-known studies, higher expression of VEGF was significantly correlated with a complete response to CCRT in this study. However, higher expression of COX-2 was significantly associated with shorter survival.

Pyrosequencing is a nonelectrophoretic nucleotide extension sequencing technology that can be used for mutation testing.;The frequency of KRAS and BRAF mutations was examined using a nonbiased database of 203 resected ESCCs and a high-throughput pyrosequencing assay.;The validity of the KRAS pyrosequencing method was initially demonstrated by detection of all 4 types of KRAS mutations [c.35G>T (codon 12 GGT>GTT), c.35G>A (codon 12 GGT>GAT), c.34G>T (codon 12 GGT>TGT), c.38G>A mutation (codon 13 GGC>GAC)], which had been previously diagnosed using Scorpion-ARMS technology, in 9 colon cancer tissues (9 of 9; 100 %). Similar results were demonstrated for BRAF mutational status in 3 colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, Colo201, and HT29), which were validated by Sanger dideoxy sequencing. Subsequently, the KRAS mutation was found to be extremely rare (1 of 203; 0.5 %), and the BRAF mutation was absent (0 of 203; 0 %), in the dataset of 203 ESCCs.;These results suggest that KRAS and BRAF mutations play a limited role in the development of ESCC and that mutation analysis is not useful as a screening test for sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy in ESCC.",

Using esophageal epithelial cells transformed by the overexpression of EGFR and p53(R175H), we find novel evidence of a functional link between p53(R175H) and the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase to mediate tumor cell invasion. Increased c-Met receptor activation was observed upon p53(R175H) expression and enhanced further upon subsequent EGFR overexpression. We inhibited c-Met phosphorylation, resulting in diminished invasion of the genetically transformed primary esophageal epithelial cells (EPC-hTERT-EGFR-p53(R175H)), suggesting that the mechanism of increased invasiveness upon EGFR and p53(R175H) expression may be the result of increased c-Met activation.

We investigated the antitumor effects of ZD1839 alone or in combination with TRAIL against human esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) lines. Although all ESCC cells expressed EGF receptor at a protein level, the effect of ZD1839 on cell growth did not correlate with the level of EGFR expression and phosphorylation of EGF receptor protein in ESCC lines.

Here, we report the co-amplification of EGFR and ERBB2 in an ulcerative and infiltrating-type SCC that measured approximately 4.2 × 2.7 × 1.2 cm with a superficial lesion occurring in the thoracic esophagus of a 72-year-old man. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification using representative tumor sections showed gain of CCND1 and coincident amplification of ERBB2 or EGFR or neither. Immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the tumor comprised three cancer-cell populations: well-differentiated SCC with high-level ERBB2 amplification and ERBB2 overexpression, more infiltrative poorly-differentiated SCC with high-level EGFR amplification and EGFR overexpression, and poorly-differentiated SCC lacking any ERBB2 or EGFR abnormality. These three populations each had low-level CCND1 amplification and nuclear cyclin D1 overexpression. This histological topology and gene amplification combinations suggested that genetic instability first produced CCND1 amplification, and then ERBB2 or EGFR gene amplification occurred. It is further speculated that during cancer progression and clonal selection indecisive predominance of either clone caused the rare co-amplification of ERBB2 and EGFR in a single chimeric tumor.",

We observed similar effects of EGCG in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma KYSE 150 cells and epidermoid squamous cell carcinoma A431 cells. Pretreatment of KYSE 150 cells with EGCG (20 micromol/L) for 0.5 to 24 hours in HAM's F12 and RPMI 1640 mixed medium at 37 degrees C, before the addition of EGF, resulted in a decreased level of phosphorylated EGFR (by 32-85%). Prolonged treatment with EGCG (8 or 24 hours) also decreased EGFR protein level (both by 80%). EGCG treatment for 24 hours also caused decreased signals of HER-2/neu in esophageal adenocarcinoma OE19 cells. These effects of EGCG were prevented or diminished by the addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD, 5 units/mL), or SOD plus catalase (30 units/mL), to the cell culture medium. A similar phenomenon on inactivation of EGFR was observed in A431 cells as well. Under culture conditions for KYSE 150 cells, EGCG was unstable, with a half-life of approximately 30 minutes; EGCG dimers and other oxidative products were formed. The presence of SOD in the culture medium stabilized EGCG and increased its half-life to longer than 24 hours and some EGCG epimerized to (+)-gallocatechin-3-gallate. A mechanism of superoxide radical-mediated dimerization of EGCG and H2O2 formation is proposed. The stabilization of EGCG by SOD in the culture medium potentiated the activity of EGCG in inhibiting KYSE 150 cell growth. The results suggest that in cell culture conditions, the auto-oxidation of EGCG leads to EGFR inactivation, but the inhibition of cell growth is due to other mechanisms. It remains to be determined whether the presently observed auto-oxidation of EGCG occurs in vivo. In future studies of EGCG and other polyphenolic compounds in cell culture, SOD may be added to stabilize EGCG and to avoid possible artifacts.",

Overexpression of each receptor may lead to cell transformation and contributes to tumor progression in various malignancies. Although these factors have been analyzed in many cancers separately, little is known about their concomitant expression in esophageal cancer. Based on the finding that EGF-R and c-erbB-2 form highly active transmembranous heterodimers that enhance cell growth and proliferation, we used Northern blot analysis and immunohistochemistry to analyze the concomitant expression of EGF-R, c-erbB-2, and c-erbB-3 in tissue samples obtained from 39 patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Northern blot analysis revealed a fourfold increase (p < 0.01) in EGF-R mRNA levels in the esophageal cancer samples in comparison with normal tissue samples. The c-erbB-2 receptor was only 1.25-fold elevated in the esophageal cancers, which failed to be statistically significant (p = 0.31). In contrast, c-erbB-3 mRNA levels were 3.5-fold lower (p < 0.01) in the esophageal cancers than in the normal tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed weak EGF-R, c-erbB-2, and c-erbB-3 immunostaining in the normal esophageal tissue. In esophageal cancer samples, immunoreactivity for EGF-R, c-erbB-2, and c-erbB-3 was mainly located in the cancer cells. Strong EGF-R, c-erbB-2, and c-erbB-3 immunoreactivity was present in 59%, 64%, and 64% of the esophageal cancer samples, respectively. In consecutive tissue sections, identical cancer cell clusters often exhibited these three closely related receptors simultaneously. However, correlation of the immunohistochemical findings with the clinicopathologic patient parameters revealed that the presence of EGF-R, c-erbB-2, or c-erbB-3 had no influence on patient survival (p > 0.05). In addition, the simultaneous presence of these receptors did not influence survival.

        "Doc_abstract":"Esophageal cancer is a prototypic squamous cell cancer that carries a poor prognosis, primarily due to presentation at advanced stages. We used human esophageal epithelial cells as a platform to recapitulate esophageal squamous cell cancer, thereby providing insights into the molecular pathogenesis of squamous cell cancers in general. This was achieved through the retroviral-mediated transduction into normal, primary human esophageal epithelial cells of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT), and p53(R175H), genes that are frequently altered in human esophageal squamous cell cancer. These cells demonstrated increased migration and invasion when compared with control cells. When these genetically altered cells were placed within the in vivo-like context of an organotypic three-dimensional (3D) culture system, the cells formed a high-grade dysplastic epithelium with malignant cells invading into the stromal extracellular matrix (ECM). The invasive phenotype was in part modulated by the activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Using pharmacological and genetic approaches to decrease MMP-9, invasion into the underlying ECM could be suppressed partially. In addition, tumor differentiation was influenced by the type of fibroblasts within the stromal ECM. To that end, fetal esophageal fibroblasts fostered a microenvironment conducive to poorly differentiated invading tumor cells, whereas fetal skin fibroblasts supported a well-differentiated tumor as illustrated by keratin \"pearl\" formation, a hallmark feature of well-differentiated squamous cell cancers. When inducible AKT was introduced into fetal skin esophageal fibroblasts, a more invasive, less-differentiated esophageal cancer phenotype was achieved. Invasion into the stromal ECM was attenuated by genetic knockdown of AKT1 as well as AKT2. Taken together, alterations in key oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in esophageal epithelial cells, the composition and activation of fibroblasts, and the components of the ECM conspire to regulate the physical and biological properties of the stroma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Squamous cell cancers comprise the most common type of human epithelial cancers. One subtype, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), is an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis due to late diagnosis and metastasis. Factors derived from the extracellular matrix (ECM) create an environment conducive to tumor growth and invasion. Specialized cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the ECM influence tumorigenesis. We have shown previously that the nature and activation state of fibroblasts are critical in modulating the invasive ability of ESCC in an in vivo-like organotypic 3D cell culture, a form of human tissue engineering. Dramatic differences in invasion of transformed esophageal epithelial cells depended on the type of fibroblast in the matrix. We hypothesize that CAFs create an environment primed for growth and invasion through the secretion of factors. We find that fibroblast secretion of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) fosters the ability of transformed esophageal epithelial cells to invade into the ECM, although other unidentified factors may cooperate with HGF. Genetic modifications of both HGF in fibroblasts and its receptor Met in epithelial cells, along with pharmacologic inhibition of HGF and Met, underscore the importance of this pathway in ESCC invasion and progression. Furthermore, Met activation is increased upon combinatorial overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and p53(R175H), two common genetic mutations in ESCC. These results highlight the potential benefit of the therapeutic targeting of HGF/Met signaling in ESCC and potentially other squamous cancers where this pathway is deregulated.",

However, a number of patients present intolerance to chemoradiotherapy because of advanced age or malnutrition. Erlotinib, an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, was shown to be effective in treating esophageal carcinoma, with mild toxicities. In this pilot study, we investigated the safety and efficacy of concurrent erlotinib and radiotherapy as an alternative treatment modality for esophageal carcinoma patients who are intolerant to chemoradiotherapy. Pathologically diagnosed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients who could not tolerate concurrent chemoradiotherapy were enrolled. All patients were treated with concurrent erlotinib and intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Erlotinib was given orally for 60 days (150 mg per day). Radiotherapy (total dose, 60 Gy) was given at dosages of 2 Gy for a total of 30 times. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to assess epidermal growth factor receptor expression. Toxicities were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0). The overall survival, progression-free survival, and local-regional relapse-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Between December 2007 and March 2011, 18 patients were enrolled. The median age was 71.5 years. Primary disease was stages II, III, and IV in 3, 8, and 4 patients, respectively. There were three patients with recurrent disease after radical surgery. The median follow-up time was 17.2 months. Grade 3 esophagitis and skin rash were observed in five (27.8%) and two (11.1%) patients, respectively. Radiation pneumonitis of grades 2 and 5 was observed in one patient each. No grade 3/4 impaired liver function or hematological toxicity was observed. At 1 month after radiotherapy, two (11.1%) patients achieved complete response, 11 (61.1%) patients achieved partial response, and 5 (27.8%) patients had stable disease. The median time of overall survival and progression-free survival was 21.1 and 12 months, respectively. Two-year overall survival, progression-free survival, and local-regional relapse-free survival were 44.4%, 38.9%, and 66.7%, respectively. Five of six patients examined for epidermal growth factor receptor had high expression levels (3+). The relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor expression and treatment outcomes could not be concluded.

Here, NCL was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting in 60 ESCC tissues. Further, the associations of NCL, EGFR, CXCR4 and Ki67 were analyzed by in vitro assays. Our results showed that NCL expression in all 40 cases of ESCC tissues with metastasis was extensively located in the nucleus, cytoplasm and cell membrane (extra-nucleus), while NCL expression in all 20 cases of ESCC without metastasis was merely limited into the nucleus (intra-nucleus).The extra-nuclear NCL expression was positively correlated with the expression of EGFR, CXCR4 and Ki67 and serves as an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients. In vitro, NCL siRNA (si-NCL) efficaciously affected the expression of EGF or SDF-1-induced p-AKT, p-ERK and Ki67. Also, NCL siRNA inhibited the capacity of migration and invasion of ECA109 cells. In conclusions, our study suggests that NCL is implicated in the initiation and transduction of EGFR and CXCR4 signaling and further up-regulates Ki67 expression to modulate the biological behaviors of ESCC.

The application of targeted therapy is widespread and reported for several tumor types. For esophageal cancer, most studies have been performed with EGFR inhibitors, including cetuximab, gefitinib, erlotinib and trastuzumab. Limited experience is available with angiogenesis inhibitors, apoptosis inhibitors and COX-2 inhibitors. As yet, targeted therapies are proven to be safe often in combination with chemoradiation, but modestly effective for esophageal cancer. Phase III trials have not been published yet and, therefore, for targeted therapies also, possibly using new concepts, more studies are needed.",

The clinical data of 16 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients, aged >70 years, who were initially treated with nimotuzumab combined with RT, were collected and retrospectively reviewed. The overall response and treatment toxicity were analyzed using SPSS software. All the patients completed the treatment schedule. The response to treatment was assessed at treatment completion and reassessed after 1-2 months: 1 patient achieved complete response (CR), 10 patients achieved partial response (PR), 4 patients exhibited stable disease and 1 patient developed disease progression and succumbed to radiation pneumonitis (RP) 1 month later. The overall response rate (CR+PR) was 68.8%. All 16 patients experienced grade 1-2 radiation esophagitis; no grade 3-4 toxicities were reported. There was one case of treatment-related mortality due to RP during the study. One patient developed a rash on the forearm. No hematological, gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal toxicities were observed. In conclusion, the toxicity of combined nimotuzumab with RT in elderly patients with esophageal cancer was tolerable. However, due to limitations associated with the retrospective nature of this study, the limited number of enrolled cases and the epidermal growth factor receptor expression determination prior to treatment, the efficacy of this treatment modality requires further investigation.",

We explored mechanisms that lead to activation of beta-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) independent of adenomatous polyposis coli and beta-catenin mutation. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay demonstrated that TCF4 and beta-catenin form a complex and have DNA binding activity. However, there was no constitutive activation of beta-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription. Coculture experiments demonstrated that Wnt-1, but not Wnt-5A and Wnt-7A, activated the TCF reporter gene. Additionally, when cultured with Wnt-1-conditioned media, ESCC cell lines showed an accumulation of beta-catenin in the cytoplasm. Although both Wnt and epidermal growth factor inactivate glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, activation of epidermal growth factor receptor did not stabilize beta-catenin.

In addition, beta-adrenoceptor is involved in the control of cancer cell proliferation. This study sought to elucidate whether a functional connection exists between these two disparate receptor systems. EGF was used to stimulate HKESC-1 cells, an esophageal squamous cancer cell line, in which beta-adrenoceptor activity was monitored by measuring intracellular cAMP levels in the absence or presence of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Results showed that EGF significantly increased cAMP levels and cell proliferation, both of which were attenuated by atenolol [(+)-4-[2-hydroxy-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]propoxy]benzeneacetamide] or ICI 118,551 [(+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol], which are antagonists for the beta-adrenoceptor. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that the cellular release of epinephrine and the expression of its synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase were induced by EGF. The expression of beta(1)-adrenoceptor and the downstream signal transducer protein kinase A were also up-regulated. In this connection, AG1478 [4-(3-chloroanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline], an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, abrogated all these EGF-elicited alteration. Collectively, this study demonstrates that beta-adrenergic signaling could be up-regulated at multiple levels upon EGFR activation to mediate the mitogenic signals in esophageal cancer cells. This novel finding not only unveils the sinister liaison between EGFR and beta-adrenoceptors but also sheds new light on the purported therapeutic use of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in the treatment of esophageal cancer.",

Trastuzumab anti-tumor efficacy was evaluated within these PDECX models (n = 8 animals/group). Furthermore, hotspot mutations of EGFR, K-ras, B-raf and PIK3CA genes were screened for in the PDECX models and their corresponding patient's ESCC tissues. Similarity between the PDECX models and their corresponding patient's ESCC tissue was confirmed by histology, morphology, HER-2 GCN and mutation.;None of the PDECX models (or their corresponding patient's ESCC tissues) harbored HER-2 gene amplification.

By contrast, bioluminescence imaging of genetically altered immortalized esophageal cells revealed that Akt, EGFR, or H-Ras, but not c-Myc, resulted in tumor formation in immunodeficient mice. H-Ras-driven tumors showed highly tumorigenic phenotypes with 2.6 +/- 0.6 days for doubling, whereas Akt and EGFR tumors doubled every 9.5 +/- 1.6 and 6.1 +/- 1.2 days, respectively. H-Ras-driven tumors expressed the hypoxia-inducible factor target Glut1, whereas Akt- or EGFR-driven tumors had evidence of angiogenesis and no detectable Glut1 expression. Proliferation rates among these tumors were similar, but there was reduced apoptosis in the more aggressive H-Ras-driven tumors that also developed aneuploidy and multiple centrosomes. c-Myc overexpression did not result in tumorigenic conversion but introduction of Bcl-XL into c-Myc-expressing cells generated tumors. Although cytokeratin expression was typical of squamous carcinoma, gene expression profiling was done to compare the four different types of engineered tumors with human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. Interestingly, c-Myc plus Bcl-XL transformants mimicked squamous carcinomas, whereas H-Ras-, EGFR-, and Akt-driven tumors were similar to adenocarcinomas in their molecular profiles.

We hypothesized that leptin may have biological effects in promoting esophageal adenocarcinoma and examined the effects of leptin on the OE33 Barrett's-derived EAC line. Proliferation was assessed by dimethylthiazoldiphenyltetra-zoliumbromide and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assays and apoptosis by ELISA of intracellular nucleosomes. Intracellular signaling was examined using specific pharmacological inhibitors and direct detection of phosphorylated active kinases. Expression of the long and short leptin receptors by OE33 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Leptin stimulated OE33 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited apoptosis. These effects were dependent on cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and replicated by adding prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The effects of PGE2 and leptin were abolished by the EP-4 antagonist AH23848. ERK, p38 MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/Akt, and Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)-2 were activated upstream of COX-2 induction, whereas the epidermal growth factor receptor and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) were downstream of COX-2. The activation of ERK and Akt but not p38 MAPK was JAK2 dependent. PGE2 stimulated phosphorylation of JNK in an EGF receptor-dependent manner, and activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor required protein kinase C, src, and matrix metalloproteinase activities. We conclude that leptin stimulates cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in OAC cells via ERK, p38 MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/Akt, and JAK2-dependent activation of COX-2 and PGE2 production. Subsequent PGE2-mediated transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and JNK activation are essential to the leptin effects. These effects may contribute to the greatly increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma in obesity.",

The T1 cases were divided into two groups: T1a cases, in which the tumor had invaded the lamina propria, and T1b cases, in which the tumor had invaded the submucosa. DNA was isolated from paraffin-embedded blocks. Oncogene amplification was determined by slot-blot hybridization.;Amplification of int-2 and c-erbB was detected in 14 and 5, respectively, of the 54 cases. Three of 12 T1b patients with int-2 amplification died of distant organ metastasis. The survival rate for the group with int-2 amplification was significantly lower than that without int-2 amplification.

Smoking and drinking alcohol are environmental risk factors for ESCC, whereas single nucleotide polymorphisms in ADH1B and ALDH2, which increase harmful intermediates produced by drinking alcohol, are genetic risk factors. We conducted a large-scale genomic analysis of ESCCs from patients in Japan to determine the mutational landscape of this cancer.;We performed whole-exome sequence analysis of tumor and nontumor esophageal tissues collected from 144 patients with ESCC who underwent surgery at 5 hospitals in Japan. We also performed single-nucleotide polymorphism array-based copy number profile and germline genotype analyses of polymorphisms in ADH1B and ALDH2. Polymorphisms in CYP2A6, which increase harmful effects of smoking, were analyzed. Functions of TET2 mutants were evaluated in KYSE410 and HEK293FT cells.;A high proportion of mutations in the 144 tumor samples were C to T substitution in CpG dinucleotides (called the CpG signature) and C to G/T substitutions with a flanking 5' thymine (called the APOBEC signature). Based on mutational signatures, patients were assigned to 3 groups, which associated with environmental (drinking and smoking) and genetic (polymorphisms in ALDH2 and CYP2A6) factors. Many tumors contained mutations in genes that regulate the cell cycle (TP53, CCND1, CDKN2A, FBXW7); epigenetic processes (MLL2, EP300, CREBBP, TET2); and the NOTCH (NOTCH1, NOTCH3), WNT (FAT1, YAP1, AJUBA) and receptor-tyrosine kinase-phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathways (PIK3CA, EGFR, ERBB2). Mutations in EP300 and TET2 correlated with shorter survival times, and mutations in ZNF750 associated with an increased number of mutations of the APOBEC signature. Expression of mutant forms of TET2 did not increase cellular levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in HEK293FT cells, whereas knockdown of TET2 increased the invasive activity of KYSE410 ESCC cells. Computational analyses associated the mutations in NFE2L2 we identified with transcriptional activation of its target genes.;We associated environmental and genetic factors with base substitution patterns of somatic mutations and provide a registry of genes and pathways that are disrupted in ESCCs.

Four patients with locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma were treated with gefitinib (250 mg/day) for 14 days and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were conducted to monitor plasma drug concentrations. Tumor cells were sampled by endoscopic biopsy prior to (baseline, day 0) and at the completion of (day 14) treatment. Cells obtained at baseline were exposed to gefitinib in short-term cell culture conditions (ex vivo assay). Western blot analyses with phospho-specific antibodies were performed to evaluate activation and biochemical response to therapy of EGFR and its downstream signaling components ERK and AKT ex vivo and in vivo. The in vivo profiles were correlated with the gefitinib-mediated alteration in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression, a marker of cell proliferation. The correlation between EGFR expression and ERK activity was also investigated by immunohistochemical analysis in pretreatment biopsies. Mutational status of the genes encoding EGFR, K-RAS, and PI3KCA (the phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic subunit p110) as well as expression levels of PTEN protein were tested in order to investigate potential confounders of the gefitinib effect. All patients completed the gefitinib therapy. PK studies demonstrated constant gefitinib concentrations during the treatment, confirming persistent exposure of target tissue to the drug at sufficient levels to achieve EGFR blockade. Ex vivo culture with gefitinib resulted in distinct response patterns representing various states of activity of the ERK and AKT pathways. The results of the ex vivo studies correctly predicted the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of the agents in tumor tissue in vivo. PCNA expression correlated with ERK pathway inhibition, but not with gefitinib-mediated inhibition of EGFR activity alone. Immunohistochemical analysis performed on pretreatment biopsies correlated with Western blot analysis of EGFR and phospho-ERK expression. No mutations were identified in exons 18-21 of EGFR, exons 2 and 3 of K-RAS or exons 9 and 22 of PI3KCA. Levels of PTEN were comparable across tumors.

Definitive chemo-radiation can be considered for locally advanced squamous cell tumors. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy is preferable in the first-line metastatic setting. Recently, HER2, EGFR, and VEGF-targeted agents have been extensively investigated as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy. Several new targets are being explored.;: There have been incremental improvements in our understanding of the molecular biology of esophageal cancer, and ethnic differences between Asian and Western populations are becoming apparent. Next-generation sequencing has failed to demonstrate significant oncogenic drivers; however, the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy for HER2-amplified tumors has been validated in the metastatic setting and is undergoing investigation in operable disease.

ESCC develops as the result of a sequence of histopathological changes that typically involves esophagitis, atrophy, mild to severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ and finally, invasive cancer. Genetic changes associated with the development of ESCC include mutation of the p53 gene, disruption of cell-cycle control in G1 by several mechanisms (inactivation of p16MTS1, amplification of Cyclin D1, alterations of RB), activation of oncogenes (e.g., EGFR, c-MYC) and inactivation of several tumor suppressor genes. Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 17q25 has been linked with tylosis, a rare autosomal dominant syndrome associated with high predisposition to ESCC. Whether this locus is also involved in sporadic ESCC remains to be elucidated. Chronic esophagitis is a frequent occurrence in populations at high risk of ESCC. These lesions often show focal accumulation of p53 protein and in some instances, patches of positive cells in esophagitis area at the margins of tumors were found to contain a mutation in the p53 gene. This observation is consistent with field cancerization in the esophagus and suggests that esophagitis may represent an interesting target for early detection of ESCC as well as for intervention strategies.",

Using next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based miRNA profiling, this study aimed to discover esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)-specific miRNAs and miRNA-related epigenetic modulations.;NGS-based miRNA profiles were generated for four pairs of ESCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues. In situ hybridization was used to assess miRNA expression and its correlation with prognosis. miRNA-related DNA methylations were identified using bisulfite genomic sequencing, and the role of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) was investigated using RNA interference. miRNA targets were screened by mRNA sequencing, and functional validation was performed in vitro and in vivo.;NGS-based miRNA profiling identified 78 differentially expressed miRNAs in ESCC. Among them, microRNA126-3p (miR-126) was significantly downregulated, and its downregulation correlated with poor ESCC prognosis. Downregulation of miR-126 was due to promoter hypermethylation of its host gene, Egfl7. DNMT1 was aberrantly upregulated in ESCC and responsible for the hypermethylation of Egfl7. Intriguingly, DNMT1 was suppressed by overexpression of miR-126, indicating the existence of a regulatory feedback circuit. ADAM9 was identified as a key target of miR-126. Ectopic expression of miR-126 or silencing of ADAM9 reduced ESCC cell proliferation and migration by inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor-AKT signaling.;Our results indicate that miR-126 is a potential prognostic indicator for ESCC and suggest that a novel \"DNMT1-miR-126 epigenetic circuit\" is involved in ESCC progression. Consequently, miR-126-based epigenetic modulations may provide a basic rationale for new approaches to antitumor therapeutics.",

This study evaluates the role of clinical and cellular markers in predicting CR and OS in patients with esophageal cancer.;Patients were treated with infusional cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil combined with daily radiotherapy followed by esophagectomy. Pretreatment tumors (n = 54) were analyzed for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), bax, and bcl-2 expression by immunohistochemistry and for p53 mutations by direct DNA sequencing of exons 5-8. Clinical covariates included patients' age at enrollment; gender; Barrett's metaplasia; and tumor location, histology, and differentiation. Logistic regression and survival analyses were used to evaluate the predictors.;Age ranged from 32 to 75 years; most patients were male (45 male; 9 female); and tumors were distal (47 distal; 7 mid), adenocarcinoma (41 adenocarcinomas; 13 squamous cell carcinomas), and moderately differentiated (33 moderate; 6 well; 15 poor). Female gender predicted CR (odds ratio 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-41). The OS was 43% at 5 years. Presence of CR (P < 0.001 log rank) and p53 mutation (P = 0.051 log rank) correlated with increased OS, whereas increased EGF-R expression predicted poor OS (P = 0.009 log rank). EGF-R remained significant when adjusted for clinical covariates.

It is usually associated with a poor prognosis because it is often at an advanced stage when diagnosed and there is a high frequency of lymph node metastases. It is important to know what prognostic factors can facilitate diagnosis, optimize therapeutic decisions, and improve the survival of these patients. A member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, c-erbB-2, has received much attention because of its therapeutic implications; however, few studies involving fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of HER-2/neu gene amplification and protein expression in ESCC have been conducted. The aim of this study was to verify the presence of HER-2/neu gene amplification using FISH, and to correlate the results with immunohistochemical expression and clinical-pathological findings.;One hundred and ninety-nine ESCC cases were evaluated using the Tissue Microarray (TMA) technique. A polyclonal antibody against c-erbB-2 was used for immunohistochemistry. Analyses were based on the membrane staining pattern. The results were classified according to the Herceptest criteria (DAKO): negative (0/1+), potential positive (2+) and positive (3+). The FISH reactions were performed according to the FISH HER2 PharmDx (DAKO) protocol. In each case, 100 tumor nuclei were evaluated. Cases showing a gene/CEN17 fluorescence ratio > or = 2 were considered positive for gene amplification.;The c-erbB-2 expression was negative in 117/185 cases (63.2%) and positive in 68 (36.8%), of which 56 (30.3%) were 2+ and 12 (6.5%) were 3+. No significant associations were found among protein expression, clinicopathological data and overall survival. Among the 47 cases analyzed, 38 (80.9%) showed no gene amplification while 9 (19.1%) showed amplification, as demonstrated by FISH. Cases that were negative (0/1+) and potential positive (2+) for c-erbB-2 expression by immunohistochemistry showed no gene amplification. However, all cases with gene amplification were positive (3+) by immunohistochemistry. According to univariate analysis, there was a significant difference (p = 0.003) in survival rates when cases with and without HER-2/neu amplification were compared.;Our data demonstrate the correspondence between gene amplification and protein expression of HER-2/neu.

For localized gastric/gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancer there are conflicting data that a peri-operative approach with cisplatin-based chemotherapy improves survival, with the benefits seen in esophageal cancer likely less than a 5-10% incremental improvement. Further trends toward improvement in local control and survival, when combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy are given pre-operatively, are suggested by recent phase III trials. In fit patients, a significant survival benefit with pre-operative chemoradiation is seen in those patients who achieve a pathologic complete response. In esophageal/GEJ cancer, definitive chemoradiation is now considered in medically inoperable patients. In squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, surgery after primary chemoradiation is not clearly associated with an improved overall survival, however, local control may be better. In localized gastric/GEJ cancer, the integration of bevacizumab with pre-operative chemotherapy is being explored in large randomized studies, and with chemoradiotherapy in pilot trials. The addition of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor and anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 antibody treatment to pre-operative chemoradiation continues to be explored. Early results show the integration of targeted therapy is feasible. Metabolic imaging can predict early response to pre-operative chemotherapy and biomarkers may further predict response to pre-operative chemo-targeted therapy. A multimodality approach to localized gastro-esophageal cancer has resulted in better outcomes. For T3 or node-positive disease, surgery alone is no longer considered appropriate and neo-adjuvant therapy is recommended. The future of neo-adjuvant strategies in this disease will involve the individualization of therapy with the integration of molecular signatures, targeted therapy, metabolic imaging and predictive biomarkers.",

The purpose of this study was to establish a set of indicators to identify superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients at a high risk of metastasis. In all, 271 superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma esophagectomy cases were reviewed retrospectively. The relationships between clinicopathological parameters and immunohistochemical findings (p53, cyclin D1, EGFR and VEGF) on tissue microarrays, on the one hand, and lymph node metastasis were assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Patients with intraluminal masses and ulcerated masses had a high risk of lymph node metastasis. Patients with superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (1) thinner than 1200 μm; (2) confined to the mucosa; (3) with submucosal invasion <250 μm; (4) with submucosal invasion ≥250 μm but with negative VEGF expression and well/moderately differentiated or basaloid histology; or (5) with submucosal invasion ≥250 μm but with weak VEGF expression and well-differentiated histology had almost no risk of lymph node metastasis. We recommend endoscopic resection for all erosive, papillary and plaque-like superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinomas where endoscopic resection is clinically feasible, and esophagectomy for all other erosive, papillary and plaque-like cases and all intraluminal masses and ulcerated tumors.

A pooled hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was applied to evaluate the effect of HER2 overexpression for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).;Eighteen studies were identified (2872 patients). HER2 overexpression was significantly associated with poor OS (HR=1.43, 95% CI: 1.11-1.85, P=0.006). This effect was observed both ESCC (HR=1.48, 95% CI: 1.04-2.11, P=0.031) and in EAC (HR=1.62, 95% CI: 1.07-2.46, P=0.023).

Six patients had lymph node metastasis, in four the metastatic carcinoma exhibited basaloid components. Histologically, all the tumors displayed a biphasic pattern of basaloid and squamous components. The former predominated in three cases, the latter in four cases. All the tumors contained solid growth of basaloid cells with microcystic patterns and stromal hyalinosis as well as palisading of cells. Ultrastructurally, markedly replicated basement membrane was observed. Immunohistochemistry revealed staining with only CK 14 and CK 19 antibodies in the periphery of the basaloid tumor nests. These antibodies were also positive in the basal layer of normal esophagus. Diffuse immunoreactivity for EGFR was demonstrated in all the tumors. Five tumors displayed p53 nuclear immunoreactivity.

Early metastatic disease and late diagnosis are common reasons responsible for this tumor's poor clinical outcome. The prognosis of esophageal cancer is very poor because patients usually do not have symptoms in early disease stages. Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus frequently complicates patients with multiple co-morbidities and these patients often require interdisciplinary diagnosis and treatment procedures. At present time, neoadjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy followed by surgery are regarded as the international standard of care. Meta-analyses have confirmed that this approach provides the patient with better local tumor control and an increased overall survival rate. It is recommended that patients with positive tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy and who are poor surgical candidates should consider definitive radiochemotherapy without surgery as a treatment option. In future, EGFR antibodies may also be administered to patients during therapy to improve the current treatment effectiveness. Positron-emission tomography proves to be an early response-imaging tool used to evaluate the effect of the neoadjuvant therapy and could be used as a predictive factor for the survival rate in ESCC. The percentage proportions of residual tumor cells in the histopathological analyses represent a gold standard for evaluating the response rate to radiochemotherapy.

In the United States and Western Europe, there has been a decline in the incidence of squamous cell carcinomas coupled with a rapid rise in incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. Although the 5-year survival rates have slowly increased over time from 4% to 14%, the outcomes are still dismal. The lack of adequate preventative strategies, inadequate screening techniques, early lymphatic and hematogenous spread, and lack of truly effective therapeutic agents all contribute to the poor outcome. This review will highlight the current status of targeted therapies in EC. This will include a review of agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptor pathways and trials planned or ongoing to incorporate these and other agents into therapy for advanced disease and into combined modality therapy for early-stage tumors. Further work is required regarding the rational integration of these targeted agents and the optimal selection of patients who will most likely benefit.",

On the other hand, both esophageal cancer cells and colon cancer cells, which were reported to have amplified epidermal growth factor receptor and activated p60v-src kinase, respectively, showed no apparent elevation of tyrosine-specific phosphorylation, and their profiles of phosphorylation were similar to that of normal human fibroblasts. Two gastric cancer cells, NUGC-4 and MKN-45, showed similar profiles of phosphorylation but their responses to growth factors differed from each other. Tyrosine phosphorylation in NUGC-4 was strongly activated by treatment with epidermal growth factor and quickly reduced by the acid treatment which is effective in removing growth factors from cellular surface receptors. On the contrary, phosphorylation in MKN-45 did not respond to either growth factor or acid treatment. These results suggest that NUGC-4 and MKN-45 have tyrosine kinases which are activated by different mechanisms but share similar substrates.",

This prospective, single-armed, open label phase II study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of paclitaxel (T)/cisplatin (P) with nimotuzumab (N) as first-line treatment in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Patients with pathologic confirmed unresectable locally advanced or metastatic ESCC were treated with the TPN regimen: nimotuzumab 200 mg weekly, paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) on day 1 and cisplatin 30 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2; repeat cycle every 3 weeks for six cycles. Radiotherapy was allowed to be admitted after four cycles of TPN treatment. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoint was the overall survival (OS), duration of disease control (DDC) and toxicities. From March 2011 to April 2013, a total of 59 patients were enrolled and 56 were eligible for the final analysis. Overall RR was 51.8% and disease control rate (DCR) (CR + PR + SD) was 92.9%. Local treatment (radiotherapy or surgery) followed by chemotherapy improved the duration of disease control for patients with metastatic disease and local-regional advanced disease to 8.2 months and more than 23 months, respectively. The OS for patients with metastatic disease was 14.0 months (95% CI: 6.8-21.2 months). The most common G3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (46.4%), nausea (48.3%), alopecia (78.6%), anorexia (42.8%), vomiting (55.4%), arthralgia (62.5%) and anorexia (5%). Adding nimotuzumab to the standard TP regiment was safe, and well tolerated.

However, patients who achieved pathological complete response can experience more survival benefit. Therefore, it is critical to identify the responders early in the course of treatment. Published data demonstrate that clinic-histopathological factors, molecular biomarkers, and functional imaging are predictive of neoadjuvant therapy. The existing biomarkers, including epidermal growth factor receptors, angiogenetic factors, transcription factors, tumor suppressor genes, cell cycle regulators, nucleotide excision repair pathway, cytokines, and chemotherapy associated genes, need to be validated and novel biomarkers warrant further exploration. Positron emission tomography (PET) is useful for differentiating the responders of neoadjuvant CRT. The most valuable parameters and the time point of performing PET in the course of treatment remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, predictive models incorporating the multiple categories of factors need to be established with a large, prospective, and homogeneous patient cohort in the future. Standardization of staging, biomarker detection method, and image acquisition protocol will be critical for the generalization of this model. Prospective, multi-center controlled trials, which stratified patients according to these predictive factors, will help guide individualized treatment strategies for patients with esophageal cancer.

In multivariable models that included number of metastatic lymph nodes, grade, tumor stage, and polysomy 17, only HER2 heterogeneity and node number were prognostic among HER2-amplified tumors, with heterogeneity showing worse DSS (hazard ratio, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.09 to 3.79; P = .025) and OS (P = .026).

The results of double biologics (bevacizumab and anti-EGFR antibody) plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic CRC has shown a worse outcome than bevacizumab-based regimen. Microsatellite Instability has again been confirmed to be an important predictor in patients with stage II colon cancer receiving adjuvant treatment. Adjuvant gemcitabine therapy for pancreatic cancer was investigated by the CONKO-001 study; this resulted in superior survival as compared with observation and can be regarded as an acceptable option, without the addition of radiotherapy. The addition of bevacizumab to gemcitabine and erlotinib was not supior to gemcitabine and erlotinib for advanced disease.

A panel of gastric and esophageal cancer cell lines was treated with wortmannin as an Akt-signal inhibitor; the MAPK signal inhibitor PD98059; lapatinib, which inhibits both the epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2 tyrosine kinase; or siRNA for MAPK. The levels of HER2-signaling molecules, APM components, and HLA class I were evaluated by Western blot, quantitative PCR, and flow cytometry. Resected gastric tumor tissues (n = 102) were analyzed for p-Erk and HLA class I expression by immunohistochemistry. As a result, inhibition of the MAPK pathway induced upregulation of HLA-A02 and HLA-A24 expression in parallel with an increase in APM components and enhanced target sensitivity to tumor Ag-specific CTL lysis. HLA-A expression was predominantly regulated by the MAPK pathway, but it was also influenced, in part, by the Akt pathway.

Therefore, for esophageal SCC patients, novel therapies such as small molecule inhibitors of tyrosine kinases (TKIs) and humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are very much needed.Esophageal SCC shows a relatively high incidence of EGFR (33%) and/or HER2(31%) overexpression. Two categories of anti-HER-family-targeting therapies have been in clinical development: small-molecule, HER-family-related TKIs such as Gefitinib,Erlotinib and Lapatinib, and humanized mAbs against the HER family represented by Cetuximab and Trastuzumab. Although there have been very few clinical trials of antiHER-family targeting drugs in esophageal SCC, some in vitro data suggested that the combination of Cetuximab and Trastuzumab could induce synergistic antiproliferative effects and additional antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activities against esophageal SCC cells. A better understanding of the detailed mechanisms involved in EGFR and/or HER2 may help identify new therapeutic targets in esophageal SCC.",

HER2 inhibition with trastuzumab has shown to improve outcomes in advanced disease. Lapatinib ditosylate (LAP), a dual anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anti-HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor with preclinical activity against GC, has been approved in HER2-positive breast cancer. We aimed to study the activity of LAP in HER2-amplified GC.;Patients (pts) with HER2-positive (gene amplification or increased copy numbers based on predefined criteria) advanced GC were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive LAP 1250mg per day 1-21 plus capecitabine (CAP) 2000mg/m(2) on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle or LAP 1500mg monotherapy day 1-21 after having failed on a platinum-based first-line therapy. HER2 status was assessed centrally. The primary end-point was the objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1). We aimed to include 38 pts per arm to show an interesting response rate of ⩾20% in either of the two arms.;37 pts were enrolled (18 to LAP+CAP, 19 to LAP). Pts had received a median of three prior treatment lines. 12 pts in the LAP+CAP group (67%) and 12 pts in the LAP group (63%) had received prior trastuzumab. Only two pts (11.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.37-34.7), both in the LAP+CAP arm, achieved an objective response. The study was closed prematurely for futility. Median time to progression was 42 (95% CI: 38-61) days in the LAP group and 83 (95% CI: 42-86) days in the LAP+CAP group. Other secondary efficacy end-points (progression-free and overall survival) were comparable in the two treatment groups. Rates of diarrhoea were higher with LAP+CAP (61%; 95% CI: 35-83) compared to 26% (95% CI 9-51) with LAP mono, whereas other adverse events were mostly similar between the groups (18 [100%] versus 17 [90%]).;Lapatinib showed insufficient activity in HER2-amplified pretreated advanced GC.

We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent method and immunohistochemistry to detect the expression of VEGF, EGFR, ES, HER-2, and NF-κBp in the serum and tissue with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and to analyze the relationship between biomarkers and clinical pathology and curative effects. Our findings were as follows: 1. The serum levels of VEGF and ES in Han patients were obviously higher than those of Uygur and Kazakh patients (P < 0.05). The VEGF positive rate in patients at a later clinical stage was higher than that of the patients at an earlier clinical stage (stages II-IV were 14.29, 50.00, and 50.00%, respectively, P < 0.05), meanwhile it was higher than that of patients without lymph node metastases (78.13 vs 25.00%, P < 0.05). The curative effective rate of patients with negative expression of VEGF was higher than that of patients with positive expression of VEGF (74.67 vs 41.40%, P < 0.05). 2. The expression of EGFR protein in male patients was higher than that of female patients (69.77 vs 35.29%, P < 0.05). Before treatment, the serum EGFR level in patients was higher than the normal group (P < 0.05). 3. The serum ES level in patients before and after treatment was significantly higher than in the normal group (P < 0.05). 4. The HER-2 positive rate in higher differentiated tumor tissue was lower than that in lower differentiated tumor tissue. (The positive rate of I, II, III grade was 70.00, 30.00, and 20.00%, respectively, P < 0.05). 5. The NF-κB positive rate in patients with lymph node metastases was higher than that of patients without lymph node metastases (65.63 vs 39.27%, P < 0.05), meanwhile median survival in the latter group was higher than that of the former group (P < 0.05).

Current FDA-approved drugs have significant problems of toxicity, safety, selectivity, efficacy and development of resistance.

Specifically, we postulate that novel combination treatments targeting members of the EGFR family and IGF-1R will yield significant anti-tumor effects in in vitro models of EC and TNBC possibly overcoming mechanisms of resistance. We show that the combination of HER-1 and HER-2 or HER-1 and IGF-1R peptide mimics/vaccine antibodies exhibited enhanced antitumor properties with significant inhibition of tumorigenesis in OE19 EC and MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell lines. Our work elucidates the mechanisms of HER-1/IGF-1R and HER-1/HER-2 signaling in these cancer cell lines, and the promising results support the rationale for dual targeting with HER-1 and HER-2 or IGF-1R as an improved treatment regimen for advanced therapy tailored to difference types of cancer.

Amplification of the c-myc gene was observed in 5 cell lines derived from well-differentiated carcinomas and all of them were accompanied by co-amplification of other examined oncogenes. The c-erbB gene was amplified in 3 cell lines. Co-amplification of hst-1 and cyclin D1, both of which are located in chromosome 11q13, was found in 9 cell lines. Without exception their amplification was simultaneous and the magnitudes were similar. Their amplification, but not their overexpression, was significantly correlated with poor prognosis in patients from whom the cell lines were established. While hst-1-gene expression was not detected, at least 1 of the genes analyzed was overexpressed in 20 cell lines vs. its expression in normal esophageal mucosal tissues. However, gene amplification was not necessarily accompanied by overexpression of the corresponding genes. Expression of the cyclin D1 gene, which has been assumed to be a target gene for 11q13 amplification, was not detected in one particular cell line with amplification of 11q13. These results suggest that the amplification/overexpression of more than I oncogene is involved in the carcinogenic process of esophageal carcinoma and that c-myc-gene amplification is associated with a well-differentiated subtype. There remains a possibility that key oncogenes other than cyclin D1 are involved in 11q13 amplification.",

In addition to mitogenic ability, we demonstrate in this report that EGF protects a human esophageal carcinoma (CE) cell line, CE81T/VGH, from staurosporine-induced apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic signal of EGF is alleviated by a MEK inhibitor PD98059 or an ERK2 dominant negative mutant but not by a phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI-3K) inhibitor wortmannin. Furthermore, v-raf blocks apoptosis induced by staurosporine. This evidence implies that the survival signal of EGF is mediated via the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway but not the PI3-K pathway. The survival effect of EGF is coincident with the induction of mcl-1, an antiapoptotic gene in the bcl-2 family. PD98059 also suppresses the induction of Mcl-1 by EGF, implying that EGF may up-regulate Mcl-1 via the MAP kinase pathway. Overexpression of mcl-1 is sufficient to protect against apoptosis, while transfection of a mcl-1 antisense plasmid causes cell death. The expression of mcl-1 antisense plasmid also suppresses the anti-apoptotic effect of EGF. Taken together, these results indicate that EGF may up-regulate Mcl-1 through the MAP kinase pathway to suppress apoptosis.",

Cetuximab was shown to be a radiosensitizing agent in the treatment of ENT neoplasia. These results led to several phase II encouraging therapeutic trials evaluating the combination of cetuximab with radiochemotherapy in locally advanced esophageal cancers. Numerous encouraging phase II trials evaluating cetuximab combined with chemotherapy in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction cancer were reported. These promising results are still to be confirmed by the ongoing phase III trials. Several studies reported HER2 overexpression in gastric cancer (7-34%), which appeared to be associated with poorer prognosis. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular HER2 domain. The international phase III trial known as ToGA (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer) aimed to determine the clinical efficacy and acceptable toxicity profile of trastuzumab in combination with first-line chemotherapy in HER2-overexpressing gastric or gastroesophageal cancer. Angiogenesis is an essential step in the initial phase of tumorigenesis, and it is normally absent from healthy tissues except for particular physiological situations, such as wound healing.

Combined-modality treatment included: paclitaxel, 200 mg/m2, 1-hour i.v. infusion, days 1 and 22; carboplatin, an area under the concentration time curve 6.0 i.v., days 1 and 22; 5-fluorouracil, 225 mg/m2/day, continuous i.v. infusion, days 1-42; and radiation therapy, 45 Gy, 1.8-Gy single daily fractions 5 days weekly, beginning day 1. All patients underwent surgical resection 4-8 weeks after completion of the preoperative therapy.;One hundred twenty-three patients (95%) completed preoperative therapy, 105 patients (81%) underwent attempted resection, and 96 patients (74%) had definitive resection. A pathological complete response was achieved in 47 of 123 evaluable patients (38%); an additional 30 patients (24%) had only microscopic residual tumor. With a median follow-up of 45 months, the median survival is 22 months (95% CI = 15-32 months), with actuarial 1-, 2-, and 3-year survivals of 71%, 47%, and 41%, respectively. The most frequent grade 3/4 toxicities of the neoadjuvant program were leukopenia (73%) and esophagitis (43%). Although 73 patients (57%) required brief hospitalizations during preoperative therapy, there were no treatment-related deaths, and 94% of patients remained candidates for resection after the completion of treatment. Six patients (6%) died after surgery.;This novel combined-modality regimen is highly active in the treatment of locoregional esophageal cancer, producing an actuarial 3-year survival of 41%. Although this preoperative regimen produced moderate acute toxicity, there were no treatment-related deaths and the large majority of patients were able to undergo subsequent esophageal resection. These results, obtained in a community-based setting and involving multiple surgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists, compare favorably with those of previous single-center and multicenter results. Further evaluation of novel combined-modality programs is warranted, as is the incorporation of epidermal growth factor receptor antagonists or other targeted agents.",

Preoperative endoscopic biopsies and matched resection specimens were collected from 75 patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) on HER2 and dual-color in situ hybridization (ISH) were performed. HER2 status was determined by following a clinical algorithm, first determining HER2 overexpression on immunohistochemistry and, when equivocal (2+), determining HER2 amplification on ISH.

HER2 positivity was seen in 18/71 (25%) biopsies and in 15/69 (22%) resection specimens. Overall, HER2 status in the biopsy was concordant with HER2 status in the resection specimen in 94% of cases. Interobserver agreement on IHC scoring for all three observers was 83% in biopsies and 85% in resection specimens. HER2 positivity was detected in 22% of esophageal adenocarcinomas.

As a result of its potential role in the selection of therapy, HER-2/neu testing has reached near-standard-of-practice status in breast cancer. There is considerable interest in HER-2/neu as a prognostic factor and target of therapy in tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. In this review of HER-2/neu expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus, stomach, and colon, a wide range of expression of HER-2/neu from 0 to 83% likely reflects both differences in methods and reagents, as well as study bias associated with patient selection (i.e., early versus advanced disease). For esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, little information exists as to the prognostic significance of HER-2/neu expression. In adenocarcinoma associated with Barrett's esophagus there is contradictory data. However, most of the information available indicates that this marker has significant prognostic value. In gastric adenocarcinoma, the wide expression range may truly reflect patient selection because HER-2/neu positivity appears linked to advanced rather than early disease with limited invasion. The majority of studies favor a significant prognostic value of HER-2/neu status for this tumor. Finally, in colorectal cancer HER-2/neu overexpression also appears to be a significant adverse outcome indicator as judged by the current published literature. In conclusion, given that either HER-2/neu protein overexpression or gene amplification is associated with approximately one-fourth of all gastrointestinal tract malignancies, strategies designed to employ the marker in therapy selection appear warranted. During the next several years it will not be surprising to see these tumors treated with antiHER-2/neu modalities such as Herceptin, likely in combination with other agents initially for patients with advanced disease, and possibly for individuals with high-risk lesions in an adjuvant setting.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The TGFβ signaling pathway is essential to epithelial homeostasis and is often inhibited during progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Recently, an important role for TGFβ signaling has been described in the crosstalk between epithelial and stromal cells regulating squamous tumor cell invasion in mouse models of head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Loss of TGFβ signaling, in either compartment, leads to HNSCC however, the mechanisms involved are not well understood. Using organotypic reconstruct cultures (OTC) to model the interaction between epithelial and stromal cells that occur in dysplastic lesions, we show that loss of TGFβ signaling promotes an invasive phenotype in both fibroblast and epithelial compartments. Employing immortalized esophageal keratinocytes established to reproduce common mutations of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, we show that treatment of OTC with inhibitors of TGFβ signaling (A83-01 or SB431542) enhances invasion of epithelial cells into a fibroblast-embedded Matrigel/collagen I matrix. Invasion induced by A83-01 is independent of proliferation but relies on protease activity and expression of ADAMTS-1 and can be altered by matrix density. This invasion was associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL1 and EGFR ligands HB-EGF and TGFα. Altering EGF signaling prevented or induced epithelial cell invasion in this model. Loss of expression of the TGFβ target gene ROBO1 suggested that chemorepulsion may regulate keratinocyte invasion. Taken together, our data show increased invasion through inhibition of TGFβ signaling altered epithelial-fibroblasts interactions, repressing markers of activated fibroblasts, and altering integrin-fibronectin interactions. These results suggest that inhibition of TGFβ signaling modulates an array of pathways that combined promote multiple aspects of tumor invasion. ",

Sadly, advances in treatment have not followed the same trend, and the prognosis for patients with esophageal ACA remains poor, with a 5-year survival rate of only 15%. Like most cancers, early detection is the key to improving prognosis, but this outcome has proven difficult in the esophagus for several reasons: 1) patients present with advanced disease because \"alarm symptoms,\" such as dysphagia, occur at a late stage, and 2) high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and early ACA are not visible on routine surveillance endoscopy. Currently, the recommended surveillance strategy involves collection of random biopsies, an imperfect technique that is limited by sampling error and is infrequently used because of the considerable time and cost it requires. Even in patients with biopsy-proven dysplasia, adequate guidance for clinical management decisions is still lacking. Dysplasia alone is not an entirely reliable biomarker for the risk of progression to ACA because the natural history of this condition is extremely variable. Clearly, there is a need for additional biomarkers that can better characterize this disease and thus improve our ability to treat patients on an individual basis. As we better understand the molecular changes that lead to the development of this cancer, new molecular biomarkers are needed to allow for more personalized diagnoses, surveillance, and treatment. Targeted agents against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are currently being evaluated for their role in combination chemotherapy for metastatic esophageal ACA. As these studies progress, a reliable approach for determining receptor status in individual patients is essential. Molecular imaging uses fluorescent probes that target specific cell-surface receptors, and has the potential to evaluate an individual patient's gene expression profile. By topically applying fluorescent probes to dysplastic epithelium during endoscopy, a variety of receptors can be visualized, and the response to treatment can be monitored in real time. This technique can mitigate the limitations of current surveillance protocols, allow for improved cancer detection, and be used for personalized treatment in the future.",

The KYSE-150R cell line was exposed to radiation, treatment with cetuximab, and combined treatment. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were analyzed using flow cytometry. Radiation survival was analyzed using clonogenic assays. RT(2) profiler PCR array was performed to analyze EGF/PDGF signaling pathway genes.;The established esophageal carcinoma cell line KYSE-150R showed higher radioresistance than parental cell line. Cetuximab could reverse the radiation resistance of KYSE-150R cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that combination with radiation and cetuximab resulted in the accumulation of cells in G1 and G2/M phases, with the reduction of cells within the S phase. Cetuximab enhanced the apoptosis induced by radiation. RT(2) profiler array showed that some intracellular signaling genes deriving from EGF/PDGF signaling pathway regulated by cetuximab.;Irradiation combined with EGFR blocked by cetuximab may reverse the resistance to radiation in radioresistant esophageal carcinoma cell. The mechanisms may include cell cycle perturbation and enhancement of radiation-induced apoptosis. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of cetuximab in combination with radiotherapy in the management of esophageal carcinoma.",

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is one of the most important cytokines which has been shown to play a critical role in cholesteatoma. In this investigation, we studied the effects of EGF on the proliferation of keratinocytes and EGF-mediated signaling pathways underlying the pathogenesis of cholesteatoma. We examined the expressions of phosphorylated EGF receptor (p-EGFR), phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), cyclinD1, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in 40 cholesteatoma samples and 20 samples of normal external auditory canal (EAC) epithelium by immunohistochemical method. Furthermore, in vitro studies were performed to investigate EGF-induced downstream signaling pathways in primary external auditory canal keratinocytes (EACKs). The expressions of p-EGFR, p-Akt, cyclinD1, and PCNA in cholesteatoma epithelium were significantly increased when compared with those of control subjects. We also demonstrated that EGF led to the activation of the EGFR/PI3K/Akt/cyclinD1 signaling pathway, which played a critical role in EGF-induced cell proliferation and cell cycle progression of EACKs. Both EGFR inhibitor AG1478 and PI3K inhibitor wortmannin inhibited the EGF-induced EGFR/PI3K/Akt/cyclinD1 signaling pathway concomitantly with inhibition of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression of EACKs. Taken together, our data suggest that the EGFR/PI3K/Akt/cyclinD1 signaling pathway is active in cholesteatoma and may play a crucial role in cholesteatoma epithelial hyper-proliferation. This study will facilitate the development of potential therapeutic targets for intratympanic drug therapy for cholesteatoma. ",

Although recurrent mutations have been characterized in EAC, little is known about their clinical and prognostic significance. Aneuploidy is predictive of clinical outcome in many malignancies but has not been evaluated in superficial EAC.;We quantified copy number changes in 41 superficial EAC using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays. We identified recurrent chromosomal gains and losses and calculated the total copy number abnormality (CNA) count for each tumor as a measure of aneuploidy. We correlated CNA count with overall survival and time to first recurrence in univariate and multivariate analyses.;Recurrent segmental gains and losses involved multiple genes, including: HER2, EGFR, MET, CDK6, KRAS (recurrent gains); and FHIT, WWOX, CDKN2A/B, SMAD4, RUNX1 (recurrent losses). There was a 40-fold variation in CNA count across all cases. Tumors with the lowest and highest quartile CNA count had significantly better overall survival (p = 0.032) and time to first recurrence (p = 0.010) compared to those with intermediate CNA counts. These associations persisted when controlling for other prognostic variables.;SNP arrays facilitate the assessment of recurrent chromosomal gain and loss and allow high resolution, quantitative assessment of segmental aneuploidy (total CNA count). The non-monotonic association of segmental aneuploidy with survival has been described in other tumors. The degree of aneuploidy is a promising prognostic biomarker in a potentially curable form of EAC.",

This study aimed to investigate promoter methylation in the deleted in lung and esophageal cancer 1 (DLEC1) gene, as well as the p16 and CDH1 genes in Japanese lung cancer cases. The methylation status of the promoter regions of DLEC1, p16 and CDH1 was investigated using methylation-specific PCR. The findings were compared to the clinicopathological features of lung cancer. Methylation-specific PCR showed that the DLEC1 promoter region was methylated in 65 out of 116 (56%) lung cancers. Patients with DLEC1-methylated cancer were associated with a significantly worse prognosis than those with unmethylated cancer (p=0.0368; hazard ratio=1.83). The p16 methylation status correlated with squamous histology (p=0.03) and smoking status (never smoker vs. smoker; p=0.0122). Patients with p16 ummethylated cancer harbored more EGFR mutations (p=0.0071). The CDH1 promoter region was hypermethylated in 65 out of 118 (55.1%) lung cancer cases. However, the CDH1 methylation status was not associated with the clinicopathological characteristics of the lung cancer types. p16 and CDH1 methylation status did not correlate with survival in the lung cancer patients.

To clarify the effects of different RAR-beta isoforms in esophageal carcinogenesis, we used real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to assess in vivo RAR-beta mRNA levels in specimens of normal and malignant human esophageal tissue, comparing these levels with each other and the expressions of other genes. RAR-beta2 mRNA expression was significantly reduced (i.e., lower in cancer than normal tissue) in 67% (18 of 27, P = 0.001) and RAR-beta(4) mRNA was increased in 52% (14 of 27, P = 0.054) of our esophageal cancer cases. The expressions of RAR-beta1, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor-I (COUP-TFI), COUP-TFII, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) mRNA were reduced, whereas epidermal growth factor receptor and cyclin D1 expressions were increased in tumor compared with in normal tissues.

Overexpression of EGF, TGF-alpha and EGF receptor (EGFR) by tumor cells is closely correlated with the tumor invasion and patient prognosis. This is substantiated by the facts that EGF and TGF-alpha act as autocrine growth factors and then induce the expression of mRNAs for multi-growth factors and their receptors (EGF, TGF-alpha, EGFR, ERBB2, PDGF). Moreover, they stimulate the expression of metalloproteinase genes suggesting that EGF and TGF-alpha successively evoke cascade phenomena which are most convenient for tumor progression, invasion and metastasis. On the other hand, multiple oncogene alterations take place in the process of tumor progression. HST-1 and INT-2 genes which is a member of fibroblast growth factor gene family, are amplified in approximately 50% of primary tumors and all the metastatic tumors of esophageal carcinomas. The amplification of ERBB2 gene in metastatic gastric carcinomas is detected more frequently than in primary carcinomas. Overexpression of multi-growth factor-receptor systems might lead to genetical alterations. Scirrhous gastric carcinoma has vast fibrous stroma with rapid and extensive growth and exhibits high malignancy. Its fibrous stroma may account for synchronous overexpression of EGF, TGF-alpha, PDGF, IGF and TGF-beta by tumor cells. Most of well differentiated adenocarcinomas show overexpression of p 185ERBB2 and coexpression of p 185ERBB2, and EGFR evidently correlates with high malignancy. In conclusion, the accumulation and interaction of several growth factors produced by tumor cells are necessary for the progression of human esophageal and gastric carcinomas. They may be attributed to genetic changes including activation of oncogenes, inactivation and deletion of anti-oncogenes and transcriptional regulatory sequences.",

Transgenic (TG) mice with cyclin D1 overexpression targeted to the oral-esophageal tissue by the EBV ED-L2 promoter showed increased severity in esophageal dysplasia without cancer development, after multiple doses of N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA). Dietary zinc deficiency (ZD) in mice enhances cellular proliferation in esophagus/forestomach and susceptibility to NMBA-induced carcinogenesis. We investigated whether cyclin D1 overexpression in TG mice, together with ZD, might lead to unchecked cell proliferation and accelerated NMBA-induced tumorigenesis. Five-week-old TG and wild-type (WT) mice were fed a ZD- or -sufficient (ZS) diet, forming four groups: ZD:TG; ZS:TG; ZD:WT; and ZS:WT. After 4 weeks, animals were given a single intragastric NMBA dose and were sacrificed 25 and 77 days later. Without NMBA, cell proliferation was greatest in ZD:TG esophagus/forestomach, followed by ZD:WT, and then ZS:TG>/=ZS:WT. The high rate of cell proliferation was accompanied by overexpression of cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis biomarkers, including proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4, p53, cytokeratin 14, epidermal growth factor receptor, and by a reduced rate of apoptosis. ZD substantially increased forestomach tumor incidence in TG mice: 85% of ZD:TG versus 14% of ZS:TG mice had forestomach tumors (P < 0.001), with progression to malignancy occurring only in ZD:TG tumors. Additionally, 14% of ZD:TG mice developed esophageal tumors and esophageal intestinal metaplasia at 77 days. Thus, cyclin D1 overexpression, in cooperation with ZD, decontrols cell proliferation, ensuring cell expansion, a prerequisite for cancer development.",

We analyzed five membrane-binding biomarkers (HER2, EGFR, pEGFR, β-catenin, and E-cadherin) and performed IHC on tumor tissue microarrays from 153 esophageal adenocarcinomas patients from a single center study. The tissue cores were scored visually applying an established routine scoring system as well as by using digital image analysis obtaining a continuous spectrum of average staining intensity. Subsequently, we compared both assessments by survival analysis as an end point. There were no significant correlations with patient survival using visual scoring of β-catenin, E-cadherin, pEGFR, or HER2. In contrast, the results for digital image analysis approach indicated that there were significant associations with disease-free survival for β-catenin, E-cadherin, pEGFR, and HER2 (P = 0.0125, P = 0.0014, P = 0.0299, and P = 0.0096, respectively).

The patients in the chemoradiotherapy group received 5-fluorouracil combined with cisplatin plus 60 Gy of radiation, and those in the surgery group received an esophagectomy with radical node dissection. Biologic markers were investigated immunohistochemically using pretreatment biopsy specimens.;The baseline clinical TNM stage was more advanced in the chemoradiotherapy group than in the surgery group. With a median follow-up period of 43 months, the 5-year survival rate was 46% in the chemoradiotherapy and 51% in the surgery group, without statistical significance (p = 0.47, log-rank test). Cox regression analysis for prognosis revealed that epidermal growth factor receptor positivity, high microvessel density, and cyclin D1 positivity yielded a low value for relative risk (0.66, 0.54, and 0.62, respectively), which favored chemoradiotherapy over surgery, without statistical significance.;This nonrandomized study showed a trend for the chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of esophageal carcinoma, but the results need to be confirmed by additional study.",

Using the modified DNA in-gel renaturation assay to detect down to 7-8 copies of amplified DNA sequences, we identified 3 gastric tumors with amplified DNA sequences and confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis that HER-2/neu was amplified greater than 5-fold in these specimens. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue sections with p185 HER-2/neu antibodies demonstrated that only the 3 gastric adenocarcinomas with corresponding HER-2/neu gene amplification displayed membrane immunoreactivity. Amplification of c-met was identified in 2 tumors, and this was the first study to assay for multiple copies of this protooncogene in fresh gastric tumor tissues. Amplification of c-erbB was observed in one tumor, and no evidence for amplification of int-2 was obtained in this series of adenocarcinomas.",

Adverse effects affecting kidneys consist in an increase or a new onset proteinuria, a decrease of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and/or a proximal renal tubular dysfunction (PRTD) that rarely leads to Fanconi's syndrome. EACS guidelines propose to screen PRTD in patients with chronic renal insufficiency, with a sudden decrease of eGFR, with hypophosphataemia (if non-renal causes such as vitamin D deficiency are excluded) and with a new onset proteinuria. We aim to evaluate the prevalence of PRTD by comparing the group of patients under TDF to the group free of TDF, in our cohort of 300 patients. We also aim to evaluate the accuracy of EACS criteria for screening PRTD in routine settings and to assess the utility of urinary samples in PRTD diagnosis.;During two consecutive years, we collected annually blood and urine samples at the same time in our outpatient clinic. We assessed kidney function, plasma levels and fractional excretion of phosphate, uric acid, potassium, plasma glucose and proteinuria. PRTD was defined by the presence of at least two out of the five following criteria: fractional excretion (FE) of phosphate >20% (or >10% when serum phosphate <0.8 mmol/L), non-diabetic glycosuria (positive urine glucose with plasma glucose <70 mg/dL), renal tubular acidosis (urinary pH >5.5 and serum bicarbonate <21 mmol/L), uric acid FE >10% or potassium FE >10%. After the first year, patients with TDF regimen who were diagnosed with PRTD were shifted to TDF-free regimen and included again in the study.;For PRTD (first line), they are expressed in number of diagnoses/total number of patients in this group. The second line resumes the number of PRTD diagnose patients who should have been screened according to EACS criteria.;PRTD screening according to EACS criteria is not sufficient to diagnose every case, especially minor PRTD, mainly because the prevalence is low and its diagnosis remains difficult in routine settings. We recommend performing a urine test including proteinuria every year for patients undergoing TDF treatment. The next step will be to follow PRTD patients to evaluate the time laps until full recovery after TDF shift.",

Systemic chemotherapy can lead to a decrease in cancer-related symptoms and prolongs survival. However, even with treatment, the prognosis remains poor; most patients with advanced disease have a median overall survival less than one year. Molecularly targeted therapies, such as those targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), are anticipated to improve the current status of systemic treatment beyond conventional cytotoxic therapy. Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy in patients is the first molecular agent in metastatic HER2 positive gastric and gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas to result in improvements in response rates, time to progression and survival. Trastuzumab is now being investigated in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting. Unfortunately, as with breast cancer, many esophagogastric patients will develop resistance to trastuzumab. Several promising therapies are currently under investigation as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy in the first and second line setting.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate human surgical specimens for cholesteatoma-associated changes in amphiregulin expression and determine potential relations to clinical disease variables. Amphiregulin, an epidermal growth factor receptor ligand, has functions in normal epithelial proliferation and aberrant neoplastic cell growth and is proinflammatory (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, fibrosis) and active in hyperproliferative cutaneous conditions including psoriasis and wound healing. These known amphiregulin activities and the characteristic epithelial expansion and bone erosion of cholesteatoma pathophysiology prompted testing of the hypothesis that amphiregulin expression levels are altered in cholesteatoma and correlate to the disease state.;Prospective experimental study, cross-sectional analysis.;Relative changes in amphiregulin gene expression were quantitated by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses of cholesteatoma epithelium compared to uninvolved control tissues from patients' postauricular and external auditory canal regions. Western immunoblot assays were performed for qualitative evaluation of amphiregulin protein expression. The t test and Fisher exact test were used for analysis.;A statistically significant increase in amphiregulin gene expression was associated with cholesteatoma specimens compared to uninvolved postauricular skin (PAS) and external auditory canal (EAC) skin, P = .004 and P = .002, respectively. From comparisons of 60 sets of skin pairs, the mean ratio of amphiregulin RNA expression for cholesteatoma/PAS is 4.94 (standard error of the mean [SEM] = 1.53, n = 30) and for cholesteatoma/EAC is 7.70 (SEM = 1.57, n = 30).;Amphiregulin is overexpressed in epithelial tissues of human cholesteatoma. Significant relationships were identified between increased amphiregulin expression levels and the extent of cholesteatoma migration and bone erosion. Our study results indicate amphiregulin is a potential biomarker of early cholesteatoma disease processes.",

The relationship of gene amplification to clinical-pathological variables and its potential usefulness as a marker for early cancer detection were also examined.;We used quantitative PCR and Southern blot analysis to screen 87 cases of Barrett's adenocarcinoma for the presence or absence of 13 distinct gene amplification events. Gene amplification was then examined for correlation with other amplification events and clinical variables (survival, stage, nodal involvement, tumor invasion, smoking history, and gender). Additionally, 22 specimens of Barrett's with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) were examined for the presence of gene amplification.;One or more amplification events were present in 50 of 87 (57%) adenocarcinomas. The ERBB2 gene was amplified in 19 of 87 (21.8%), CCNE1 in 11 of 87 (12.6%), GATA4 in 9 of 87 (10.3%), KRAS in 9 of 87 (10.3%), EGFR in 7 of 87 (8.0%), CCND1 in 6 of 87 (6.8%), HNF3alpha in 5 of 87 (5.7%), PIK3CA in 5 of 87 (5.7%), C-MYC in 4 of 87 (4.6%), DYRK2 in 2 of 87 (2.3%), and AIB1, AKT1, and IGF1R were amplified in 0 of 87 (0%) of the tumors.

ANXA1 has been implicated in early squamous cell carcinogenesis of esophagus and correlates with degree of tumor differentiation. However, the role of ANXA1 in esophageal adenocarcinoma is unclear. Our goal was to evaluate ANXA1 expression and determine its prognostic significance in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction.;This study included 104 consecutive patients with primary resected esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinomas (11 stage I, 24 stage II, 53 stage III, and 16 stage IV). ANXA1 protein expression in each tumor was assessed by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays. ANAX1 expression level was classified as high (>/=25% of tumor cells with cytoplasmic staining), low (<25% of tumor cells with cytoplasmic staining), or negative; and was correlated with clinicopathologic features and patients' outcomes.;High ANXA1 expression was present in 39% (41 of 104) of tumors and was associated with higher pathologic T stage (P = 0.03) and distant metastasis (P = 0.04). High ANXA1 expression correlated with increased recurrence rate (P = 0.004) and decreased overall survival (P = 0.003) in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, ANXA1 expression and pN stage significantly correlated with recurrence rate (P = 0.008 and P < 0.001, respectively) and overall survival (P = 0.02 and P < 0.001, respectively) independent of T stage.;Our results indicate that high ANXA1 expression is frequent in esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinomas, correlates with more advanced pathologic T stage and the presence of distant metastasis, and is an independent prognostic factor for patient survival.",

        "Doc_abstract":"This review describes genetic and molecular changes related to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) with emphasis on prognostic value and possibilities for targeted therapy in clinical setting. Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or GEJ is an aggressive disease with early lymphatic and hematogenous dissemination. Molecular pathology has revealed many molecular mechanisms of disease progression, which are related to prognosis. Some of these factors can be seen as prognostic factors per se. Better knowledge of molecular bases may lead to new paradigms, improved prognostication, early diagnosis and individually tailored therapeutic options.;A review of recent English literature (1990-October 2005) concerning esophageal adenocarcinoma was performed. This review focuses on genetic and molecular changes as prognosticators of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and GEJ.;A bewildering number of biomarkers have been described. Many genes and molecules have prognostic impact (cyclin D1, EGFR, Her-2/Neu, APC, TGF-beta, Endoglin, CTGF, P53, Bcl-2, NF-kappaB, Cox-2, E-cadherin, beta-catenin, uPA, MMP-1,3,7,9, TIMP, T( h )1/T( h )2 balance, CRP, PTHrP).;Adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and GEJ show multiple genetic alterations, which indicate that progression of cancer is a multistep complex process with many different alterations. Presumably, it is not one molecular factor that can predict the biological behavior of this cancer. The combination of diverse genetic alterations may better predict prognosis. In future, gene expression analysis with microarrays may reveal important prognostic information and the discovery of new genes and molecules associated with tumor progression and dissemination will enhance prognostication and offers adjuvant therapeutic options.",
