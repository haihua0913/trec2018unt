To investigate the spectrum of RET mutations among Japanese patients, we screened the RET gene in 71 patients with thyroid carcinomas. The panel included representatives of 44 families carrying FMTC or MEN2, 22 sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs), and five MTCs without familial information. Mutations in nucleotide sequences encoding one of three specific cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of the RET protein were found in 33 of the 34 MEN2A patients and in five of the six FMTC patients examined. A mutation at codon 918, causing the substitution of threonine for methionine in the tyrosine kinase domain of the protein, was found in germline DNAs of all four patients with MEN2B and in two of the 22 patients with sporadic MTCs; codon 918 was mutated somatically in tumor DNAs from three other sporadic cases. Germline mutations of codon 768, GAG to GAC (Glu to Asp), were detected in one FMTC, in one patient with sporadic MTC, and in one of the patients without familial information. Two somatic mutations, an Asp to Gly substitution at codon 631 and a Cys to Arg substitution at codon 634, had not been reported previously. Of five germline mutations found among the 22 sporadic cases, four were confirmed as de novo mutations since in each case neither parent carried the mutation. As nearly one-fourth of the patients with sporadic MTCs carried germline mutations and 50% of their children are expected to develop MTC and other endocrine tumors, these results indicated the importance of careful clinical surveillance of family members of any patient with MTC.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The rearranged during transfection (RET) gene is a proto-oncogene; active mutations frequently occur in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). This study investigated the spectrum of germline RET mutations and clinical features in Chinese hereditary MTC patients. A total of 53 family members from 11 different hereditary MTC families were recruited for detection of RET exon 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16 mutations, in genomic DNA from peripheral blood leucocytes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct DNA sequencing. Of the 53 participants, eight different germline RET mutations were detected in 37 individuals. These RET mutations were distributed in exons 10, 11, 13, and 16. The most frequent RET mutation was localized at exon 11 codon 634 (67.6 %; 25/37) and the most prevalent mutation was C634R (37.8 %; 14/37). The most frequent phenotype was multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A). The incidences of MTC, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism in the MEN2A patients were 100, 36.4 and 18.2 %, respectively. The phenotype of families with Y606C or L790F mutation was categorized as familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Moreover, one proband was identified with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B and carried a de novo mutation of M918T. Two families with C618S/Y mutation were categorized as unclassified multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. Our results further substantiate that most germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene were localized at codon 634 in Chinese hereditary MTC patients and carriers. RET mutation at codon 634 was always associated to the phenotype of MEN2A. Screening of RET mutations should be probably limited to exons 10, 11, 13 and 16 initially to be cost-effective in China.",

However, two previous reports have given discrepant results on the frequency of the mutations in RET in sporadic MTCs in Japan. To clarify this problem, we analyzed mutations in RET exon 16 in 72 sporadic MTCs by means of the two methods used in the previous studies, direct sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Mutations in exon 16 were detected in only 2 of 72 cases of sporadic MTC.

We investigated exons 10, 11, 13, 14 and 16 of the RET proto-oncogene in 33 unrelated Japanese patients with MTC. Eleven of the 33 cases (33%) were found to have germ-line mutations.

The new mutations were present in the germ-line DNA of four unrelated patients for whom a family history of MTC had not been documented.

To study somatic mutations in the RET protooncogene in Japanese and Chinese sporadic MTCs and to analyze comparatively the correlation between RET mutation and tumor differentiation, we investigated somatic mutations in the RET protooncogene in 20 Japanese and 20 Chinese sporadic MTCs by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Of the 40 sporadic MTCs, 13 had a point mutation in codon 918 of exon 16, a frequency of 32.5%. There was no significant difference in the frequency between Japanese and Chinese sporadic MTCs, as 30% of the Japanese and 35% of the Chinese sporadic MTCs contained this mutation. We did not observe any correlation between the presence or absence of codon 918 mutation and tumor differentiation in either Japanese or Chinese sporadic MTCs. Our findings indicate that the frequency of RET somatic mutations is similar in Japanese and Chinese sporadic MTCs, and the presence or absence of RET mutation does not correlate with the differentiation of sporadic MTCs.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignant tumor. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is an aggressive tumor arising from calcitonin-producing parafollicular cells. MTC has autosomal dominant inheritance and accounts for 5-10 % of all thyroid cancers. It occurs in hereditary (25 %, hMTC) and sporadic (75 %, sMTC) forms. Gain-of-function mutations in the REarranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene have been identified in 98 % of hMTC and 50 % of sMTC. The aim of this investigation was to identify mutation(s) in the much conserved RET exon10 in Iranian MTC patients. We started screening patients with MTC for RET in 2001. This study included 347 individuals (154 with sMTC, 38 with FMTC, 8 with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A [MEN2A], 3 with MEN2B, and 3 with pheochromocytoma; 207 index cases and 140 relatives). Germline mutation screening of RET exon10 was performed with PCR-DNA sequencing. A total of 14 missense mutations (10 mutations in men and 4 in women) were identified in cysteine codons 611, 618, and 620 (exon10) in 11 patients and three first-degree relatives as follows: four C611Y (three with FMTC and one relative), one C618R (FMTC), one C618S (sMTC), one C620G (sMTC), four C620R (one with FMTC and three with sMTC), and three C620F (one with FMTC and two relatives). In the present study, six different mutations were identified in exon10 of RET in 14 patients with sMTC and FMTC that were restricted to codons 611, 618, and 620, but not in codon 609. This data showed a skewed pattern of RET exon10 mutation compared to other populations. No mutation was found for MEN2A, MEN2B, and pheochromocytoma in exon10 in this population. In the most common mutations in exon10, the FMTC and sMTC patients were C611Y and C620R, respectively.",

RET oncogenes arise through sporadic and inherited gene mutations and are involved in the etiopathogenesis of medullary thyroid carcinoma, a cancer that responds poorly to conventional chemotherapy. Medullary thyroid carcinoma is a component of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 or MEN2 syndromes.;We investigated the cellular effects of RPI-1, a novel 2-indolinone Ret tyrosine kinase inhibitor on cells that express RET C634 oncogenic mutants common in the MEN2A syndrome: NIH3T3 fibroblasts transfected with RET(C634R) and human medullary thyroid carcinoma TT cells that express endogenous RET(C634W). RPI-1 antiproliferative activity was determined by cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth assays. Expression and phosphorylation of Ret and of proteins involved in downstream signaling pathways were examined by immunoblotting. Antitumor activity of oral RPI-1 treatment was tested by using two dosing levels in nude mice bearing subcutaneous TT xenograft tumors. All statistical tests were two-sided.;The RPI-1 IC50 value for cell proliferation was 3.6 microM (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8 to 5.4 microM) in NIH3T3 cells expressing the Ret mutant compared with 16 microM (95% CI = 12.3 to 19.7 microM) in non-transfected NIH3T3 cells, and that for colony formation in soft agar was 2.4 microM (95% CI = 0.8 to 4.0 microM) and 26 microM (95% CI = 17 to 35 microM) in RET mutant-transfected and H-RAS-transfected NIH3T3 cells, respectively. In NIH3T3 cells expressing the Ret mutant, Ret protein and tyrosine phosphorylation were undetectable after 24 hours of RPI-1 treatment. In TT cells, RPI-1 inhibited proliferation, Ret tyrosine phosphorylation, Ret protein expression, and the activation of PLCgamma, ERKs and AKT. In mice, oral daily RPI-1 treatment inhibited the tumor growth of TT xenografts by 81% (P<.001 versus control mice) and reduced the plasma levels of the specific biomarker calcitonin (P =.01 versus control mice). Twenty-five percent of RPI-1-treated mice were tumor-free.;Ret oncoproteins represent exploitable targets for therapeutic intervention in MEN2A-associated medullary thyroid carcinoma.

To determine the incidence of RET mutations in medullary thyroid carcinoma in Japan, we investigated 14 medullary thyroid carcinomas (comprising 1 case of MEN 2A, 1 case of MEN 2B, 2 cases of familial medullary thyroid carcinoma and 10 cases of sporadic). Tumors from all cases were screened by PCR-SSCP on exons 10 and 11. DNA sequencing on these exons was performed for the hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma cases. The PCR products of exon 16 from tumor DNA were analyzed by means of Fok1 restriction enzyme digestion analysis and mutations confirmed by DNA sequencing. We found no structural abnormalities in either exon 10 or exon 11 in any of the cases examined, but in four of 10 sporadic cases we detected a common point mutation at codon 918 (ATG to ACG) in exon 16, where methionine was replaced with threonine. Our results support the theory that a point mutation of exon 16 of the RET proto-oncogene may be related to the oncogenesis of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas.

The aim of this study was to characterize the RET mutational spectrum in MEN2 families and apparently sporadic MTC (AS-MTC) cases originating from the central region of Portugal.;We studied a total of 82 individuals (64 affected and 18 family members), comprising five MEN2 families (four MEN2A and one MEN2B), as well as 53 AS-MTC cases. RET germline mutations were screened using PCR-DNA sequencing, SSCP and RFLP. The haplotypes associated with recurrent mutations were determined by fragment analysis of microsatellite markers, and by RFLP, in the case of intragenic polymorphisms.;Frequency of the Cys611Tyr (TGC-TAC) mutation was significantly increased in this region of Portugal, due to the fact that three apparently unrelated MEN2A/FMTC families, out of the five in which mutations were identified, harboured this specific mutation.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), a malignant tumor arising from calcitonin-secreting thyroid C cells, is the cardinal disease feature of this syndrome, and mortality in affected MEN-2 patients is mainly caused by this malignancy. Germ-line mutations of the RET protooncogene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, are responsible for these three neoplastic-prone disorders. MEN2 mutations convert the RET protooncogene in a dominantly acting oncogene as a consequence of the ligand-independent activation of the tyrosine kinase. The majority of MEN2A and FMTC mutations are located in the extracellular domain and cause the replacement of one of five juxtamembrane cysteines by a different amino acid. To examine whether expression of a MEN2A allele of RET results in transformation of C cells, we have used the transgenic approach. Expression of the RET gene altered by a MEN2A mutation was targeted in C cells by placing the transgene under the control of the calcitonin gene-related peptide/calcitonin promoter. Animals of three independent transgenic mouse lines, which expressed the transgene in the thyroid, displayed overt bilateral C cell hyperplasia as early as 3 weeks of age and subsequently developed multifocal and bilateral MTC. Moreover, these tumors were morphologically and biologically similar to human MTC which afflicts MEN2 individuals. These findings provide evidence that the MEN2A mutant form of RET is oncogenic in parafollicular C cells and suggest that these transgenic mice should prove a valuable animal model for hereditary MTC.",

The specificity of berberine was demonstrated by using the papillary thyroid carcinoma TPC1 cell line, which lacks the G-quadruplex forming sequence on the RET promoter region due to chromosomal rearrangement.;Berberine suppressed the RET expression by more than 90 % in MTC TT cells at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml with minimal effect on the TPC1 cells. Canadine, which is a structural analogue of berberine, showed little interaction with RET G-quadruplex and also had no effect on RET expression in MTC TT cells. The down-regulation of RET with berberine further inhibited the cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest and activation of apoptosis in TT cells, which was confirmed by a 2-fold increase in the caspase-3 activity and the down-regulation of cell-cycle regulatory proteins.;Our data strongly suggest that the G-quadruplex forming region and the stabilization of this structure play a critical role in mediating the repressive effect of berberine on RET transcription.",

Upon RET inhibition, adoptive stimulation of EGFR partially rescued TT cell proliferation, MAPK signaling, and expression of cell-cycle-related genes.

Although a strong genotype-phenotype correlation has been described, wide clinical heterogeneity is observed among families with the same RET mutation or even in carriers of the same kindred. In recent years, several single nucleotide polymorphisms of the RET gene have been described in the general population as well as in patients with MTC. Some studies have reported associations between the presence of polymorphisms and development or progression of MTC. Nonetheless, other studies failed to demonstrate any effect of the RET variants. Differences in the genetic background of distinct populations or methodological approaches have been suggested as potential reasons for the conflicting results.

MTC is generally associated with a favorable prognosis when diagnosed during childhood, where it frequently occurs secondary to activating mutations in the RET proto-oncogene and arises from pre-existing C-cell hyperplasia. MEN2A accounts for 90-95% of childhood MTC cases and is most commonly due to mutations in codon 634 of RET. MEN2B is associated with the most aggressive clinical presentation of MTC and is almost always due to the Met918Thr mutation of RET. Surgery is the primary treatment and only chance of cure, although the advent of targeted therapies seems to be improving progression-free survival in advanced cases. Since the discovery of the role of RET in MEN2A, considerable advances in the management of this syndrome have occurred, and most of the children with MEN2A who have undergone early thyroidectomy will now lead full, productive lives. Strong genotype-phenotype correlations have facilitated the development of guidelines for interventions. Contemporary approaches for deciding the appropriate age at which surgery should take place incorporate data from ultrasonography and calcitonin measurements in addition to the results of genotyping.

Therefore, we crossed transgenic mice expressing oncogenic RET (RET2B) with mice lacking p18 (and p27, another cell cycle inhibitor) and monitored MTC development. RET2B;p18(+/-) mice and RET2B;p18(-/-) mice developed MTC with a highly increased incidence compared with their corresponding single mutant littermates. In addition, expression of oncogenic RET causes an earlier age of onset and larger MTCs in p18(-/-);p27(+/-) mice. In a subset of MTCs of RET2B;p18(+/-)(;p27(+/-)) mice, p18(Ink4c) expression was completely lost. This loss of p18(Ink4c) expression correlated with higher proliferation rates as well as with larger MTCs, indicating that loss of p18 in combination with oncogenic RET not only increases the risk for MTC development but also enhances MTC progression.

Blood samples were collected from all subjects, genomic DNA was extracted and RET exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16 were analyzed using PCR and direct sequencing.;32 missense mutations were identified in exons 10 (6.25%) and 11 (84.4%). Moreover, two novel mutations in codon 595 in exon 10 (E595D and E595A) and a new mutation in codon 689 exon 11 (S689T) were detected, and a new nucleotide change was found in exon 11 (T675T). Four different polymorphisms were also identified in exons 11, 13, 14, and 15. Based on our data, the frequency profile of RET mutations in the Azari population of Iran with MTC is 61.7%. The most frequent mutation in our population was C364G, whereas in most populations it is C634R.;These results underline the importance of the genetic background of family members of any patient with MTC.",

We analysed RET exons 5, 8, 10-16 in fifty-one sporadic MTC, and found somatic mutations in thirty-three (64.7%) tumours. Among the RET-positive cases, exon 16 was the most frequently affected (60.6%). Two novel somatic mutations (Cys630Gly, c.1881del18) were identified. MTC patients were divided into three groups: group 1, with mutations in RET exons 15 and 16; group 2, with other RET mutations; group 3, having no RET mutations. Group 1 had higher prevalence (P=0.0051) and number of lymph node metastases (P=0.0017), and presented more often multifocal tumours (P=0.037) and persistent disease at last control (P=0.0242) than group 2. Detectable serum calcitonin levels at last screening (P=0.0119) and stage IV disease (P=0.0145) were more frequent in group 1, than in the other groups. Our results suggest that, among the sporadic MTC, cases with RET mutations in exons 15 and 16 are associated with the worst prognosis.

The major component tumor of these syndromes is medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). To date, somatic mutations in RET have not been identified in tumors from individuals with MEN 2, although they have been well documented in sporadic MEN 2-related tumors.

Signaling elements downstream of these oncoproteins were identified after treating cells with the indolinone tyrosine kinase inhibitor RPI-1 to knock down RET phosphorylation activity. We detected 23 and 18 affinity-purified phosphotyrosine proteins in untreated TT and MZ-CRC-1 cells, respectively, most of which were shared and sensitive to RPI-1 treatment. However, our data clearly point to specific signaling features of the RET-MEN2A and RET-MEN2B oncogenic pathways. Moreover, the detection of high-level expression of minimally phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in both TT and MZ-CRC-1 cells, together with our data on the effects of EGF stimulation on the proteomic profiles and the response to Gefitinib treatment, suggest the relevance of EGFR signaling in these cell lines, especially since analysis of 14 archival MTC specimens revealed EGFR mRNA expression in all samples.

Germline RET mutations are seen virtually in all familial forms of MTC and somatic RET mutations are often detected in sporadic MTC. In sporadic MTCs the RET gene is mutated in codon 918, where a methionine is substituted to a threonine (M918T). In this study 24 MTCs were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) for chromosomal imbalances. Overall, alterations were detected in approximately 60% of the samples. The most common aberrations were gains on chromosome 19q (29%), 19p (21%), 11c-q12 (12.5%), and 22q (12.5%) and losses on 13q21 (21%) and 3q23-qter (12.5%). Gain of chromosome 11c-q12 was only detected in samples from patients whom died of MTC (p=0.001). These MTCs also harbored the somatic RET M918T mutation and also showed the highest numbers of CGH alterations in the series (p<0.003). Although there was a tendency towards a higher number of CGH imbalances in the tumors with RET M918T mutation, this difference was not significant. The results indicate that MTC is a comparatively genetically stable tumor, and that chromosomal regions 19q, 19p, 13q and 11q may be involved in MTC carcinogenesis.",

Three different somatic missense mutations were documented in seven patients. In five patients a mutation in exon 16, codon 918, (ATG-->ACG) causing a Met-->Thr substitution was found. In the remaining two patients the mutation affected exon 11: codon 630 in one case and codon 634 in the other. In both cases a T-->C transversion was identified causing a Cys-->Arg substitution. In conclusion, absence of a germline mutation in RET exons 10, 11, 13 or 16 is evidence against an inherited form in all cases. In seven patients, identification of a somatic mutation supported the previous clinical diagnosis of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma; in one of them we identified a hitherto undescribed somatic point mutation at codon 630.",

As part of a cell-surface complex, RET binds glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligands in conjunction with GDNF-family alpha co-receptors (GFRalpha). Ligand-induced activation induces dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation of the RET receptor with downstream activation of several signal transduction pathways. Activating germline RET mutations play a central role in the development of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and also in the development of the congenital abnormality Hirschsprung's disease. Approximately 50% of patients with sporadic MTC have somatic RET mutations, and a significant portion of papillary thyroid carcinomas result from chromosomal inversions or translocations, which activate RET (RET/PTC oncogenes). The RET protooncogene has a significant place in cancer prevention and treatment. Timely thyroidectomy in kindred members who have inherited a mutated RET allele, characteristic of MEN2A, MEN2B, or FMTC, can prevent MTC, the most common cause of death in these syndromes. Also, recently developed molecular therapeutics that target the RET pathway have shown activity in clinical trials of patients with advanced MTC, a disease for which there has been no effective therapy.",

We have previously shown that approximately 80% of sporadic MTCs had at least one subpopulation with a somatic RET mutation. Uneven distribution of somatic mutation within a single tumor or among metastases from a single individual was notable. In the present study, we sought to correlate RET expression, as demonstrated by RET immunohistochemistry, with mutation status in sporadic MTC for each tumor. Seventy evaluable subpopulations, belonging to 28 unrelated sporadic cases, comprising primary MTC and metastases, were immunostained with two different polyclonal antibodies raised against the C-terminus of RET. The regional presence of codon 918 or 883 seemed to coincide with increased RET immunopositivity in at least 62 of 70 (89%, P < 0.000001) tumor subpopulations. The reasons for this concordance are not entirely clear but could be related to either RNA or protein stability. Preliminary studies have suggested that the presence of somatic codon 918 mutation in MTC has a prognostic significance. If these preliminary results prove true, then given our data, we can further explore the feasibility of RET immunocytochemistry as a rapid assessment for the presence of somatic codon 918 for molecular diagnostic and prognostic purposes.",

We have established a transplantable MTC in nude mice from a sporadic human MTC carrying a RET C634R mutation. Transplanted tumors had an exponential growth rate with an approximate doubling time of about 3 weeks, and expressed a neuroendocrine phenotype characteristic of MTC, e.g., expression of calcitonin, chromogranin A (CgA), synaptophysin, synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2), vesicular monoamine transporter-1 and -2, carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin 8/18, epithelial cadherin, and neural cell adhesion molecule. Plasma calcitonin and CgA levels were elevated in tumor-bearing mice and correlated with tumor size. Cytogenetic analysis, including spectral karyotyping, confirmed the human origin of the xenografted tumors and demonstrated an abnormal, near triploid karyotype. Treatment of tumor-bearing nude mice with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD6474, which specifically inhibits RET, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and vascular endothelium growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinases, resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth. Oral ZD6474 given once daily (250 mg/kg, 5 days/week) reduced tumor volume to 11% when compared with controls after 4 weeks.

In this exploratory study, we investigated the expression of eight key TKI target proteins (EGFR, KIT, MET, PDGFRB, VEGF (VEGFA), VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4)) by immunohistochemistry in 103 molecularly characterized MTC samples and identified the associated clinical and molecular features. A number of MTC samples exhibited a high expression of VEGFR2 and VEGFR3, which were overexpressed in 57 and 43% of the MTC samples respectively. VEGFR1, PDGFRB, VEGF, KIT, and MET were present in 34-20% of the cases, while EGFR was highly expressed in only 10% of the MTC samples. Some proteins exhibited large differences in expression between sporadic and familial cases, suggesting that different RET mutations may be associated with the immunohistochemical profiles. MTC samples with the C634 RET mutation exhibited a higher expression of VEGFR3 and KIT than the M918T RET-mutated and non-mutated RET tumor samples (P=0.005 and P=0.007 respectively) and a lower expression of VEGFR1 (P=0.04).

These genetic syndromes are associated with germline-activating mutations of the RET protooncogene, a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor, which is believed to modulate specific intracellular signaling pathways involved in the regulation of C cell proliferation and apoptosis. RET-activating mutations involve two important functional areas of the receptor: the cysteine-rich extracellular domain and the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma are more commonly associated with mutations in the cysteine-rich extracellular domain, whereas multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B is exclusively associated with mutations involving the second intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Here, we describe a novel missense mutation of the RET protooncogene that substitutes arginine for proline at codon 912 of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain in a family with medullary thyroid carcinoma.",

MTC occurs in both sporadic and familial forms, the latter making up 25% of all MTCs and being comprised of three distinct syndromes--multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN 2B), and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). To date, screening for MTC has been performed using the pentagastrin stimulation test, which is a provocative test for calcitonin release. Germline mutations in the RET protooncogene have been identified in families manifesting these syndromes and genetic screening of individuals at risk of one of these syndromes has become integral to their clinical management. The majority of the mutations associated with MEN 2A and FMTC are tightly clustered in a cysteine-rich region of the RET receptor. A single mutation associated with MEN 2B is in the the tyrosine kinase domain of the RET receptor. Somatic mutations have been identified in the tumor tissue of individuals with sporadic MTC and may prove to be helpful markers in discerning the hereditary or sporadic nature of the MTC. There is general agreement that the primary operation for MTC should include total thyroidectomy and central neck lymph node clearance. The role of microdissection for recurrent disease awaits longitudinal evaluation. External radiotherapy, radionuclide therapy, and chemotherapy may have a role in palliation, but have not been proven to have a curative value. Prognostic factors are discussed.",

The primary genetic cause of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is germline mutation of the RET protooncogene. Somatic point mutations in RET also occur in sporadic MTC. Although RET mutation is likely sufficient to cause C-cell hyperplasia, the precursor lesion to MTC, tumor progression is thought to be due to clonal expansion caused by the accumulation of somatic events. Using the genome-scanning technique comparative genomic hybridization, we identified chromosomal imbalances that occur in MTC including deletions of chromosomes 1p, 3q26.3-q27, 4, 9q13-q22, 13q, and 22q and amplifications of chromosome 19. These regions house known tumor suppressor genes as well as genes encoding subunits of the multicomponent complex of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptors alpha-2-4) and their ligands glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, neurturin, persephin, and artemin that facilitate RET dimerization and downstream signaling.

Metastatic MTC patients are incurable because the cancer does not respond to radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The REarranged during Transfection (RET) proto-oncogene plays a key role in the development of MTC. However, one-half of the sporadic MTC do not carry RET mutations. Mice models and early evidence obtained in human samples suggest that other genes, including those encoding components of the RB1 (retinoblastoma) and TP53 tumour-suppressor pathways, may be involved in MTC formation. Here, we review the data on the involvement of genes acting in the RET and RB1/TP53 pathways in MTC. Understanding genetic lesions that occur in MTC is a prerequisite to identifying molecular therapeutic targets in MTC and in improving the efficacy of RET-targeted therapies.",

There are three subtypes, namely, MEN2A (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A), MEN2B (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B), and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. The variations in the RET gene play an important role in the MEN2 syndromes. In this work, we have developed a RET oligonucleotide microarray of 67 oligonucleotides to quickly detect RET mutations in MEN2 syndromes. The predominant RET mutations are missense mutations and are restricted to nine codons (codons 609, 611, 618, 620, 630, 634, 768, 804, and 918) in MEN2 syndromes. Missense mutations at codons 609, 611, 618, 620, and 634 have been identified in 98% of MEN2A families and in 85% of familial medullary thyroid carcinoma families. More than 95% of MEN2B patients also had a predominant mutation type at codon 918 (Met-->Thr). RET oligonucleotide microarray can detect RET missense mutations at these nine codons. Theoretically, a total of 55 missense mutation types can occur at eight codons (codons 609, 611, 618, 620, 630, 634, 768, and 804). RET oligonucleotide microarray is designed to detect all of these 55 missense mutation types at these eight codons and one predominant type at codon 918. Fifty-six oligonucleotides were designed for the 56 mutation types at nine codons, and 11 oligonucleotides were designed for the wild types and positive controls. We found RET mutations in all eight of the Korean MEN2A families (a total of 75 members; 27 affected members, 19 gene carriers, and 29 unaffected members) using the developed RET oligonucleotide microarray and an automatic sequencing. Because we found only five mutation types from eight MEN2A families, the international collaborations are required to see whether the RET oligonucleotide microarray may be used as a genetic diagnostic tool. Taken together, the RET oligonucleotide microarray can function as a fast and reliable genetic diagnostic device, which simplifies the process of detecting RET mutations.",

Rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene plays a crucial role in MTC development. Besides RET, other oncogenes commonly involved in the pathogenesis of human cancers have also been investigated in MTC. The family of human RAS genes includes the highly homologous HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS genes that encode three distinct proteins. Activating mutations in specific hotspots of the RAS genes are found in about 30% of all human cancers. In thyroid neoplasias, RAS gene point mutations, mainly in NRAS, are detected in benign and malignant tumors arising from the follicular epithelium. However, recent reports have also described RAS mutations in MTC, namely in HRAS and KRAS. Overall, the prevalence of RAS mutations in sporadic MTC varies between 0-43.3%, occurring usually in tumors with WT RET and rarely in those harboring a RET mutation, suggesting that activation of these proto-oncogenes represents alternative genetic events in sporadic MTC tumorigenesis. Thus, the assessment of RAS mutation status can be useful to define therapeutic strategies in RET WT MTC. MTC patients with RAS mutations have an intermediate risk for aggressive cancer, between those with RET mutations in exons 15 and 16, which are associated with the worst prognosis, and cases with other RET mutations, which have the most indolent course of the disease. Recent results from exome sequencing indicate that, besides mutations in RET, HRAS, and KRAS, no other recurrent driver mutations are present in MTC. ",

The activating germline point mutations in the RET, which are known to induce oncogenic activation of RET tyrosine kinase, are associated with the development of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and pathogenesis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2). The polypurine/polypyrimidine tract in the proximal promoter region of the human RET gene (-51 to -33 relative to transcription start site) is essential for basal transcriptional activity of this gene. This tract consists of a guanine-rich sequence containing five runs of at least three contiguous guanines separated by one or more bases, conforming to a general motif capable of forming an intramolecular G-quadruplex. Here, we show that specific G-quadruplex structures formed in the RET promoter region act to repress the transcription of this gene, and transcription of this gene can be controlled by ligand-mediated G-quadruplex stabilization. In this study, NSC194598, a derivative of indeno[1,2,3-de]quinazoline, was found to be a novel G-quadruplex interactive agent that interfered with transcriptional activation of mutated RET gene in human medullary thyroid carcinoma TT cells. This compound significantly reduced endogenous RET protein levels and increased apoptosis in these cells. Our results provide further support for the idea that G-quadruplex structures may have a critical role in transcriptional regulation of the RET gene in vivo, providing insight into a novel strategy for transcriptional repression of this gene by small molecules.

NF-kappaB has been shown to be activated through several signaling pathways that involve growth factor receptors. The aim of the study was to assess the immunohistochemical expression of members of the NF-kappaB family and the putative targets of NF-kappaB in a series of medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTCs), in correlation with RET mutational status. A tissue microarray was constructed from paraffin-embedded blocks of 48 MTCs (13 familial, 35 sporadic) previously evaluated for germ line and somatic RET mutations. Immunohistochemical evaluation included members of the NF-kappaB (p50, p65, p52, c-Rel, RelB) family, as well as putative targets of NF-kappaB such as Flip, Bcl-xL, and cyclin D1. Nuclear immunostaining for members of NF-kappaB was frequent in MTCs (p50, 19%; p65, 68%; p52, 86.6%; c-Rel, 75%; RelB, 36%). MTCs with germ line or somatic RET mutations (29 cases) showed NF-kappaB nuclear translocation (particularly of p65, P = .035) more frequently than MTCs without RET mutations (19 cases). Immunostaining for putative targets of NF-kappaB showed a significant statistical association between p65 and Bcl-xL (P = .024). In addition, Bcl-xL expression was statistically higher in the tumors with exon 16 RET mutation in comparison with those with exon 10 and 11 RET mutations or wild-type RET (P = .002). Moreover, the significance of RETsignaling in NF-kappaB activation was evaluated in the RET-mutated TT cell line. TT cells were infected with lentiviruses carrying short hairpin RNA to knock down RET expression, and NF-kappaB activity was assessed by luciferase reporter assays. Silencing of RET in the TT cell line produced a significant decrease in NF-kappaB activation and reduction in ERK1/2. The results suggest that the NF-kappaB is frequently activated in MTCs. The results also support the hypothesis that RET activation by somatic or germ line mutations may be responsible for NF-kappaB activation in MTCs.",

The aim of this work is to elaborate allelic frequencies of the RET proto-oncogene polymorphisms in Turkish sporadic MTC patients and to demonstrate if there is an association between SNP and the clinical disease features, specifically the age at onset of MTC and lymph node involvement at diagnosis. We analyzed the allelic frequencies of SNP of the exon 11, 13, 14 and 15 of the RET proto-oncogene in blood samples from 50 sporadic MTC patients, using the polymerase chain reaction methodology followed by DNA sequencing. The observed allelic frequencies were 24% for G691S polymorphism in exon 11, 29% for L769L polymorphism in exon 13, 5% for S836S polymorphism in exon 14, and 26% for S904S polymorphism in exon 15. These frequencies are similar to those reported in other countries. We did not observe any significant association of all four SNP with the age at onset of MTC.

In particular, MEN2A is a more complex and aggressive disease than FMTC, being characterized by pheochromocytomas and parathyroid alterations, in addition to medullary thyroid carcinomas. The mutations associated with MEN2A and FMTC affect one of five cysteine residues mapping in the extracellular domain of the Ret protein. However, recent studies have indicated that MEN2A and FMTC disease phenotypes correlate with the position of mutations in RET. Mutations of Cys-634 are more frequent in families with MEN2A, whereas Cys-620 mutations are very rarely found in MEN2A patients and, in contrast, are frequently found in FMTC patients. We have reported previously that mutations of Cys-634 constitutively activate the RET transforming potential by causing a disulfide bridge-mediated homodimerization. Here, we report that the mutation Cys-620 --> Tyr is able to cause a constitutive dimerization of Ret, with consequent activation of its kinase and transforming activities, to a lower extent than mutation of Cys-634.

        "Doc_abstract":"Causative gain-of-function mutations of the RET tyrosine-kinase receptor gene have been reported in more than 95% of inherited cases of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC; OMIM# 155240). Most RET activating mutations are clustered in mutational \"hot spots\" in exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 and are usually detected by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) followed by direct sequencing. To improve sensitivity, time and costs of mutational screening we have developed a denaturing high performance chromatography (DHPLC) protocol, based on the detection of heteroduplex molecules by ion-pair reverse-phase liquid chromatography under partially denaturing conditions. The mutational screening of RET exons 10, 11, 13-16 was performed in a total of 111 subjects, including 45 MTC patients and 49 relatives with known RET mutations and 17 individuals, being at risk of hereditary MTC and carrying unknown RET alleles. Heteroduplex peaks with a distinct and reproducible DHPLC elution profile allowed the detection of both rare and common RET mutations. Overall, the DHPLC-based methodology showed a high level of sensitivity and accuracy, nearing 100%. Furthermore, our protocol showed the ability to identify: 1) all the mutated codons of RET located in the \"hot spots\" domain; 2) the different point mutations occurring in the same codon of RET gene; 3) less frequent or rare mutations; 4) polymorphisms. As such, it can be proposed as a relatively simple and highly accurate method for a rapid genetic testing for members of MTC families.",

Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2, inherited as an autosomal dominant disease, is characterized by coexistence of MTC with other endocrine neoplasia. Activating mutations of the RET proto-oncogene, involving the somatic or the germinal cell lineage, are found in both inherited and acquired forms. In this study, RET mutations were screened in 47 individuals either affected by MTC or belonging to families with hereditary MTC. Exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the RET gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and examined by DNA sequence and/or restriction enzyme analysis to detect mutations in purified amplicons. Six MEN 2A families with a germline mutation at codon 634, one FMTC family carrying a mutation at codon 618 and two MEN 2B families with a mutation at codon 918 were identified. In affected members of a MEN 2A family no known RET mutations were observed. Besides, we identified a germline mutation in a patient with apparently sporadic MTC and in two out of three sons, indicating the presence of a sporadic misclassified familial disease. In all of the families examined we were able to distinguish the affected vs unaffected (not at risk) members.

RET oncogenes that have been implicated in the development of thyroid carcinomas are emerging as potential therapeutic targets. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy and the cellular bases of antitumor activity of the indolinone Ret tyrosine kinase inhibitor RPI-1 against large established s.c. TT tumor xenograft, a human medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) harboring oncogenic MEN-2A-type RET mutation. Oral treatment with RPI-1 caused growth arrest or regression in 81% treated tumors. Following treatment suspension, tumor inhibition was maintained (51%, P<0.05, 100 days) and cures were achieved in 2/11 mice. In treated tumors, Ret was tyrosine dephosphorylated. Moreover, compared to control tumors, a significant increase in apoptotic cells (210%, P<0.0001), loss of cellularity (47%, P<0.0001) and reduction of microvessel density (36%, P<0.0005) were detected. In vivo effects of RPI-1 were reflected in activation of BAD, cleavage of caspases, apoptotic DNA fragmentation and inhibition of VEGF production observed in in vitro RPI-1-treated TT cells. These findings thus indicate that RPI-1 antitumor effect on the MTC was characterized by apoptosis induction and angiogenesis inhibition. The results, consistent with a dependence on RET oncogene activation for maintenance and survival of MEN2A-type MTC, provide further preclinical rationale for a pharmacological RET-targeted intervention in thyroid cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"MicroRNAs are a primordial mechanism of gene expression control that appear to be crucial to cellular development and may play an important role in tumor development. Much is known about the genetics of medullary thyroid carcinomas, as approximately 25% are hereditary and harbor germ line activating mutations in the RET gene. Somatic RET mutations are also seen in roughly 50% of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas. Few studies, however, have evaluated the role of microRNA expression in these tumors. DNA and RNA were extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of 15 medullary thyroid carcinomas [10 with RET mutations (3 hereditary) and 5 without RET mutations] and 5 non-tumor thyroid glands. miRNA expression of 754 targets was quantitated by real-time PCR using the ABI OpenArray miRNA assay. Three miRNAs showed significant differential expression and were validated in a larger cohort of 59 cases by real-time PCR. Expression of potential downstream targets and upstream regulators was also investigated by real-time PCR. miR-375 and miR-10a were significantly overexpressed, while miR-455 was underexpressed in medullary thyroid carcinomas. Expression of all 3 miRNAs was validated in the larger cohort of cases (miR-375, p=3.3×10(-26); miR-10a, p=5.6×10(-14); miR-455, p=2.4×10(-4)). No significant differences in miRNA expression were found between RET mutation positive and negative tumors nor between sporadic and hereditary tumors. Expression of the potential downstream targets of miR-375, YAP1 (a growth inhibitor) and SLC16a2 (a transporter of thyroid hormone), was down-regulated in the tumors suggesting that miR-375 is a negative regulator of the expression of these genes. Thus, differential expression of miR-375, miR-10a and miR-455 may be important for tumor development and/or reflect C-cell lineage of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Furthermore, the growth inhibitor YAP1 is identified as a potential important downstream target of miR-375. ",

The distinction between true sporadic MTC and a new mutation familial case is important for future clinical management of both the patient and family. The susceptibility gene for MEN 2 is the RET proto-oncogene. Systematic analysis for germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene was performed in a series of 67 patients with apparently sporadic MTC to determine whether they were true sporadic cases or unsuspected de novo MEN 2 cases.;Sixty-seven unselected patients with sporadic MTC were randomly ascertained from clinic patients from four centres. The diagnosis of MTC was confirmed by histopathology. Germline DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes or from paraffin-embedded tissue and subsequently used for polymerase chain reaction amplification.;Polymerase chain reaction based RET mutation analysis was performed by direct double-stranded cycle sequencing of exons 10, 11, 13 and 16, within which the majority of MEN2 mutations have been shown to occur.;In this series, there was one proven case of germline mutation in RET codon 620, which previously has been shown to be responsible for MEN 2, thus indicating heritable disease. No germline mutation in codon 918, typical of MEN 2B, was found.;A figure of 1.5% germline mutations in 67 apparently sporadic MTC is lower than the incidence of familial disease reported in previous series involving clinical and biochemical screening. The presence of a germline mutation in the RET proto-oncogene in a patient with MTC indicates heritable disease. The absence of germline RET exon 10, 11, 13 or 16 mutation appears to rule out MEN 2A to a high probability, although the presence of a familial form of MTC other than classical MEN 2A cannot be excluded conclusively.",

To assess altered RET mutation-specific gene expression, and to identify yet unknown gene transcripts involved in the tumorigenesis of MTC, we performed an expression analysis by mRNA differential display (RT-DD). Snap-frozen tumor tissues and corresponding normal thyroid tissues of 8 patients suffering from MTC (6 sporadic, 2 hereditary tumors) were included in the study; 5/8 MTCs harbored RET point mutations (codons 618, 634, 918). The RT-DD method was refined by use of fluorescence-labeled arbitrary oligonucleotides, electrophoresis on an automated sequencer, and a novel fragment-recovery technique utilizing a high-performance fluorescence scanner. More than 400 differentially expressed mRNA transcripts--representing upregulated or downregulated genes in the compared tissues--were detected. In all, 28 selected fragments were recovered, cloned, sequenced, and identified. Differential expression of gene transcripts with known association to cell proliferation or tumor progression--such as annexin A2, Rab11a, trefoil proteins, superoxide dismutase (SOD1), mitochondrial displacement loop (D-loop), and G protein subunit gamma11--as well as of the neuroendocrine marker chromogranin was observed. Furthermore, several mRNA transcripts of yet unknown genes displayed mutation-specific upregulation or downregulation in MTC.

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) accounts for 5-8% of all thyroid cancers. MTC is mainly sporadic in nature, but an hereditary pattern [multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2)] is present in 20-30% of cases, transmitted as an autosomal-dominant trait due to germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene. About 98% of patients with MEN 2 have germline mutations in exons 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 or 16 of the RET gene. The primary treatment of both hereditary and sporadic forms of MTC is total thyroidectomy and removal of all neoplastic tissue present in the neck. The therapeutic option for lymph node surgery should be dictated by the results of presurgical evaluation. After total thyroidectomy, measurements of serum calcitonin (CT) and carcinoembryonic antigen are of paramount importance in the postsurgical follow-up of patients with MTC as they reflect the presence of persistent or recurrent disease. Complete remission is demonstrated by undetectable and stimulated serum CT measurement. On the contrary, if serum CT is detectable under basal conditions or becomes detectable after stimulation, the patient is probably not cured, but imaging techniques will not demonstrate any disease until serum CT approaches levels >150 pg/ml. The tumour metastasises early to both paratracheal and lateral cervical lymph nodes. Metastases outside the neck may occur in the liver, lungs, bones and, less frequently, brain and skin. Surgery is the main treatment for local and distant metastases whenever feasible. Systemic chemotherapy with dacarbazine, 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin (alone or in combination) has shown very limited efficacy, achieving only partial responses in the range of 10-20% and of short duration. Several kinase inhibitors are currently under evaluation and preliminary results are promising. Familial cases must be identified by searching for RET proto-oncogene mutations in the proband and in family members. Carriers of the RET gene are candidates for prophylactic thyroidectomy at different ages depending on the risk associated with the specific RET mutations.",

To assess the role of RET in the development of MTC and PC, we screened 14 sporadic MTC, two MTC-derived cell lines, and 5 sporatic PC cases of RET mutations by a systematic analysis of the whole coding sequence, including all intron-exon junctions. In only 6 of the 14 sporadic MTC we were able to detect a RET mutation. Apart from the MET918-->Thr mutation in 5 of the MTC cases, we found a 3-bp deletion in exon 11, only present in the tumor, in another case. Analysis of 2 cell lines revealed the Met918-->Thr mutation in 1 and a Cys634-->Trp mutation in the other cell line. A possible somatic nature of these mutations could not be confirmed because in neither case was constitutive DNA available. We conclude that a large proportion of sporadic MTC must be due to mutations in an unidentified gene(s) other than RET. In none of the sporadic PC cases was a RET mutation found. As PC is a frequent complication in families suffering from von Hippel Lindau disease, for which mutations of the VHL gene are responsible, we also screened the 5 sporadic PC cases for VHL mutations. This revealed a Gly164-->Ser mutation in a single specimen. Thus, in PC, a large majority of tumors are due to mutations in an unidentified gene(s) other than RET and VHL.",

In MEN-associated CCH and small MTC, bcl-2 was strongly expressed, bcl-x was moderately expressed and bax was only weakly expressed. Advanced tumours and LNM did show a more heterogeneous bcl-2 staining accompanied by an increased bax expression and accelerated proliferation. The rate of apoptosis was extremely low in all investigated tumours. P53 was detectable in three patients with rapidly growing and extensively metastasising MTC. No somatic p53 mutations were found. Hereditary MTC with germline RET mutations at codon 918 (MEN2b) and codon 634 revealed a bias towards a higher proliferation activity at a younger age and are more frequently accompanied by LNM. CCH and MTC are characterised with a preponderance of bcl-2 as a factor blocking the programmed cell death. While MTC, in general, is a slowly growing tumour, a minority of tumours do progress rapidly with high proliferation. The factors leading to an accelerated tumour progression do not seem to take their effect via the regulation of apoptosis. Certain alterations of RET are supposed to have a direct or indirect implication on proliferation and, because of this, an effect on the clinical course.",

DNA was extracted from microdissected tumor tissue or normal cells and subjected to nested PCR prior to analysis. A markedly divergent SSCP pattern and a PCR fragment 9 bp shorter than normal were demonstrated in 14 of the 15 MTC tumors. Sequencing revealed the deletion of nine bases encompassing a key cysteine at codon 634, often altered in MEN 2A. Four lymphocyte controls and normal thyroid tissue from one patient failed to show the deletion.

Distinct activating RET mutations cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A), type 2B (MEN2B), and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). Despite clear correlations between the mutations found in these cancer syndromes and their phenotypes, the molecular mechanisms connecting the mutated receptor to the different disease phenotypes are far from completely understood. Luciferase reporter assays in combination with immunoprecipitations, and Western and immunohistochemistry analyses were done in order to characterize the signaling properties of two FMTC-associated RET mutations, Y791F and S891A, respectively, both affecting the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor. We show that these RET-FMTC mutants are monomeric receptors which are autophosphorylated and activated independently of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. Moreover, we show that the dysfunctional signaling properties of these mutants, when compared with wild-type RET, involve constitutive activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we show that STAT3 activation is mediated by a signaling pathway involving Src, JAK1, and JAK2, differing from STAT3 activation promoted by RET(C634R) which was previously found to be independent of Src and JAKs. Three-dimensional modeling of the RET catalytic domain suggested that the structural changes promoted by the respective amino acids substitutions lead to a more accessible substrate and ATP-binding monomeric conformation. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis of FMTC tumor samples support the in vitro data, because nuclear localized, Y705-phosphorylated STAT3, as well as a high degree of RET expression at the plasma membrane was observed.",

Mutations in the RET protooncogene are known to be the cause of the MEN2A and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) syndromes in the majority of the families. Direct DNA testing allows prophylactic thyroidectomy to be offered to individuals carrying a mutation in the above codons, and in mutation-negative cases it reduces the yearly screening-related burden on family members at risk of the disease. By DNA sequencing and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms, 65 MTC probands were examined for mutations in residues 609, 611, 618, 620 of exon 10, and in residues 634, 768, 804 of exons 11, 13, and 14 respectively of the RET protooncogene. In our study, mutations in the above codons were detected in all of the 14 clinically MEN2A and FMTC families. One of these mutations, TGC609 TCC has not been reported previously. Of the 14 probands with the mutation, 25 relatives also had the identified mutation and 18 relatives proved to be non-carriers. Among the 51 probands with clinically sporadic MTC, none was found to carry a mutation in the above positions even if indirect signs of MTC, pheochromocytoma or hyperparathyroidism could be detected in some families. The frequency of the TGC634AGC mutation is unexpectedly high in our samples, which can probably be attributed to a founder effect. We conclude that screening for mutations in these codons is effective in families fulfilling the strict clinical criteria of MEN2A or FMTC.",

Furthermore, meta-analysis of published studies including the present results was conducted. To test the contributory role of the above polymorphisms for the development of \"C\"-cell hyperplasia, we studied a group of 10 individuals selected for having a positive pentagastrin test despite the absence of a RET germline mutation. An over-representation of the G691S polymorphism, particularly in females, was observed in patients with respect to controls, although not reaching the level of significance. Allelic frequencies of the other three polymorphisms were not different in patients and controls. Results obtained in the admittedly small group of individuals with a positive pentagastrin test are unlikely to support a major influence of any polymorphism in the development of \"C\"-cell hyperplasia. The meta-analysis provided evidence for a significant association of the S691 allele with MTC (odds ratio 1.54, 95% confidence interval 1.12-2.12, p=0.008) and found no significant associations for the other polymorphisms.",

To clarify the phenotypic heterogeneity associated with these mutations, we compare the clinical data and age of diagnosis among these three homozygous patients, six other heterozygous cases from the same populations, and other homozygous and heterozygous subjects reported previously. The data are consistent with a model in which codon 804 mutations have low penetrance, the developing of medullary thyroid carcinoma being associated with a second germline or somatic mutation.

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is subdivided into sporadic (75 %) and hereditary (25 %) forms. Several germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are the source of distinct clinical phenotypes in hereditary MTC including familial MTC (FMTC) and multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A (MEN 2A) and 2B (MEN 2B). The higher the penetrance of the MEN 2 phenotype the earlier the progression of MTC which forms the basis for the currently recommended codon-related concept of prophylactic thyroidectomy. In patients with sporadic MTC, routine calcitonin (CT) measurement in nodular goiter patients has been shown to reduce the frequency of advanced tumor stages. Patients with CT levels over 100 pg/ml after pentagastrin stimulation are recommended for total thyroidectomy. In patients with unexpected sporadic MTC after histological examination, completion thyroidectomy is currently only recommended when CT levels remain elevated. The extent of lymph node dissection in patients with MTC is controversial. However, with respect to lymphonodal micrometastases, systematic compartment-oriented microdissection has been shown to reduce the frequency of lymphonodal recurrence. On the other hand, to avoid unnecessary lymph node dissection, a more individualized concept is required in the future. New chemotherapeutic agents (tyrosine kinase inhibitors), therapeutic nuclids (90Yttrium-labeled octreotide), and chemoembolization of liver metastases are currently the most promising therapeutical concepts in patients with distant metastases.",

We correlated mutation status with calcitonin and pathologic studies to determine genotype-phenotype correlations.;We identified a mutation in codon 804 in exon 14 (GTG-->ATG; V804M) in both families. An 86-year-old person who was a gene carrier and other individuals over age 70 who were suspected by pedigree analysis to be gene carriers had no overt clinical evidence of MTC. Four of 21 patients who underwent a thyroidectomy also had papillary thyroid cancer. One individual in each family had metastatic MTC at age 30 and 32 years, and all 26 people having thyroidectomies had either MTC or C-cell hyperplasia, leading us to continue to recommend prophylactic thyroidectomy for all identified patients who were gene carriers.;Because of active MTC in younger members of these families, including metastases, we have continued to advocate thyroid surgery in mutation-positive individuals. While DNA diagnosis of gene carriers and subsequent genetic counseling was relatively straightforward, the acceptance of surgical recommendations was more difficult for some individuals.

Recently, germline point-mutations in RET cysteine codons of the extracellular cysteine-rich domain (encoded by exons 10 and 11) and in the tyrosine-kinase domain (encoded by exon 16) at codon 918, have been associated with the syndromes of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A, MEN type 2B and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). In our recent studies we have analyzed tumor and germline DNA extracted from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens of 45 patients and additional blood samples of 38 possible MEN 2 gene carriers for the presence of RET point mutations in exons 10 and 11 by non-radioactive single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (PCR-SSCP) and for exon 16 by heteroduplex gel electrophoresis. Mutational analysis was performed by fluorescence-based dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing of PCR-products with an automated DNA sequencer. Materials included 19 patients with MEN 2A associated tumors (13 medullary thyroid carcinomas, 6 pheochromocytomas), 3 patients with MEN 2B associated medullary thyroid carcinomas and 23 patients with clinically sporadic tumors (16 medullary thyroid carcinomas, 7 phenochromocytomas). In all 19 MEN 2A patients we found RET germline point-mutations either at cysteine codons 634 (14), 630 (1) in exon 11 or at codon 618 (4) in exon 10. All 3 MEN 2B patients demonstrated germline point mutations at codon 918 (Met-->Thr) in exon 16. In 2 patients with clinically sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas we found a point mutation at codon 634 both in DNA of the tumor and normal tissue, indicating the presence of a de novo germline mutation. In 5 sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas and 2 pheochromocytomas we found a somatic point mutations were identified in 11 patients. Our results indicate that mutational analysis of the RET proto-oncogene is not only suitable to identify and subtype MEN 2 gene carriers using blood DNA but also to distinguish sporadic from inherited medullary thyroid carcinomas and phenochromocytomas analyzing DNA extracted from archival tissue specimens.",

In 8 families with FMTC or MEN-2A, no mutation could be detected in the cysteine-rich domain encoded in exons 10 and 11 of the ret protooncogene. DNA sequencing of additional exons (no. 13-15) revealed rare noncysteine mutations in 3 families (codons 631, 768, and 844). In contrast to these rare events, heterozygous missense mutations in exon 13, codons 790 and 791, were found in 5 families (4 with MTC only; 1 family with MTC and pheochromocytoma) and 11 patients with apparently sporadic tumors. Two different mutations in codon 790 (TTG-->TTT, TTG-->TTC; Leu790Phe) and one mutation in codon 791 (TAT-->TTT; Tyr791Phe) created a phenylalanine residue. We conclude that codons 790 and 791 of the ret protooncogene represent a new hot spot for FMTC/MEN-2A causing mutations. With the discovery of these considerably common mutations in codons 790 and 791 and the identification of some rare mutations, 100% of the German FMTC/MEN-2A families could be characterized by a mutation in the ret protooncogene.",

A single haplotype shared by chromosomes bearing the Cys 618 Arg mutation in both families strongly suggests a founder effect for this mutation.

Approximately 40 percent of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) typically have either intrachromosomal or extrachromosomal rearrangements that join the promoter and NH(2)-terminal domains of unrelated genes to the COOH-terminal fragment of RET. The RET point mutations associated with MEN2A, MEN2B, or FMTC, or the chromosomal breakpoints and translocations associated with PTC, typically activate the RET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). RET kinase inhibitors are likely to be beneficial for patients with hereditary MTC, where currently there is no effective chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Recently, the low molecular weight tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD6474 was found to block the enzymatic activity of RET-derived oncoproteins in cultured cell lines. We have developed a Drosophila model for MEN2A and MEN2B diseases by targeting oncogenic forms of RET to the developing Drosophila eye. Here we show that, when fed orally, ZD6474 suppressed RET-mediated phenotypes within the context of this in vivo model. Importantly, ZD6474 showed high efficacy and very low toxicity. This compound failed to significantly suppress an activated form of another RTK, the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor, nor did it suppress the activity of downstream components of the RET/Ras pathway. Our results support the view that targeting chemical kinase inhibitors such as ZD6474 to tissues with oncogenic forms of RET is a useful treatment strategy for RET-dependent carcinomas.",

To clarify the contradictory findings, we studied the association of certain SNPs considering age, gender, and histopathology in a large Austrian cohort with C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) and MTC.;Genotyping of SNPs located in RET codons 691, 769, 836, and 904 from 199 patients with MTC and CCH (basal calcitonin > 10 pg/mL, pentagastrin stimulated > 100 pg/mL) was performed, and the results were analyzed considering gender, age at diagnosis, and histopathology.;No significant difference of SNP frequencies was found in the study patients versus normal controls. In sMTC and sporadic CCH (sCCH) no significant association of SNP frequency with the age at diagnosis was found.

Twenty surgically resected sporadic MTCs, previously analyzed for RET mutations by Sanger sequencing using DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, were investigated for intragenic mutations in 50 cancer-associated genes applying a multigene Ion AmpliSeq next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Thirteen (65 %) MTCs harbored a RET mutation; 10 were detected at both Sanger and NGS sequencing, while 3 undetected by Sanger were revealed by NGS. One of the 13 RET-mutated cases also showed an F354L germline mutation in STK11. Of the seven RET wild-type MTCs, four cases (57.1 %) harbored a RAS mutation: three in HRAS (all Q61R) and one in KRAS (G12R).

RET mutation analysis revealed a novel germline missense mutation in codon 666, c.1997A>G (p.K666R). She underwent total thyroidectomy with lymphadenectomy and simultaneous total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue. She was given calcium lactate and alfacalcidol to prevent postoperative hypocalcemia. Pathological findings of the thyroid tumor were compatible with MTC, but the resected parathyroid glands were intact. To our knowledge, c.1997A>G (p.K666R) is a new RET mutation. This is a minor variant, but it is significant because of the possible pathogenicity in tumor formation. It is often difficult to determine whether MTC is generated as part of MEN2-related disease or familial MTC when it is a unique manifestation. In addition, it is still unclear whether all missense mutations in this codon reported previously will lead to the same clinical course and prognosis. Further careful observations of clinical presentation are required to determine the clinical features associated with this variant.",

In this study, the authors examined genomic DNA from 26 primary neuroblastoma tumours for MEN2A and MEN2B RET mutations, using restriction enzyme digestion of polymerase chain reaction products as an alternative to direct sequencing.

In this study we sought to identify such locus. On the other hand, because an overrepresentation of G691S/S904S variants in patients with sMTC had been previously reported, we sought to determine if such association was present in our series.;We performed a case-control study analysing a wide spectrum of RET variants in the 5' region of the gene, as well as the variants G691S/S904S. Haplotype distribution were also analyzed. A total of 58 patients with sMTC were included in the study. In addition, 100 unselected, unrelated race-, age-, and gender-matched normal controls were also evaluated.;Although the overrepresentation of IVS1-126G>T remains present in our current sMTC series, thus supporting our previous hypothesis, no differences were obtained among cases and controls in the distribution of the variants tested upstream this position. On the other hand, the frequency and distribution of G691S/S904S variants were similar in both groups of study, leading to exclude their role in sMTC in our series.;These findings would suggest that the major genetic events contributing to the appearance of sMTC may reside in several different RET loci.

Here, we investigate whether the RET variants L769L, S836S, and G691S/S904S influence disease presentation in hereditary or sporadic MTC patients. One hundred and two patients with hereditary MTC and 81 patients with sporadic MTC attending our institution were evaluated. The frequencies of RET polymorphisms in hereditary MTC were as follows: L769L, 17.3%; S836S, 7.95%; and S904S/G691S, 18.2%. No associations were observed between these polymorphisms and pheochromocytoma, hyperparathyroidism, lymph node, or distant metastasis. However, patients harboring the S836S variant were younger than those without this allele (17±8.2 vs 28.6±14.4 years, P=0.01), suggesting that these patients had metastases at a young age. Accordingly, the cumulative frequency of local and/or distant metastases as estimated by Kaplan-Meier curves showed that lymph node and distant metastases occurred earlier in patients harboring the S836S variant (P=0.003 and P=0.026 respectively). The S836S allele frequency was higher in sporadic MTC patients than in controls (10.5 vs 3.1%, P=0.01). Individuals harboring the S836S variant were younger (38.6±13.3 vs 48.5±16.7 years, P=0.02) and showed a higher percentage of lymph node and distant metastases (P=0.02 and P=0.04 respectively). Kaplan-Meier estimates of lymph node and distant metastases yielded distinct curves for patients with or without the S836S allele (P=0.002 and P=0.001 respectively). Additional analyses using a COX regression model showed that the S836S variant was independently associated with metastatic disease (hazard ratio 2.82 (95% confidence interval 1.51-5.26), P=0.001). In conclusion, the RET S836S variant is associated with early onset and increased risk for metastatic disease in patients with hereditary or sporadic MTC.",

The clinical course of this disease varies from extremely indolent tumors that can go unchanged for years to an extremely aggressive variant that is associated with a high mortality rate. As many as 75% of all medullary thyroid carcinomas are sporadic, with an average age at presentation reported as 60 years, and the remaining 25% are hereditary with an earlier age of presentation, ranging from 20 to 40 years. Germline RET proto-oncogene mutations are the genetic causes of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and a strong genotype-phenotype correlation exists, particularly between a specific RET codon mutation and the (a) age-related onset and (b) thyroid tumor progression, from C-cell hyperplasia to medullary thyroid carcinoma and, ultimately, to nodal metastases. RET mutations predispose an individual to the development of medullary thyroid carcinomas and can also influence the individual response to RET protein receptor-targeted therapies. RET codon 609 point mutations are rare genetic events belonging to the intermediate risk category for the onset of medullary thyroid carcinoma. A large genealogy resulting in a less aggressive form of medullary thyroid carcinoma is associated with the high penetrance of pheochromocytoma and has been reported in the literature. In this short review article, we comment on our previous report of a large multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A kindred with the same Cys609Ser germline RET mutation in which, conversely, the syndrome was characterized by a slightly aggressive, highly penetrant form of medullary thyroid carcinoma that was associated with low penetrance of pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism.",

Significant advances have been made in the molecular biology of MTC, but some aspects of diagnosis and management still remain controversial.;We reviewed relevant articles published in major English-language medical journals. We used the MEDLINE database, selected bibliographies, and articles available in our personal files.;Mutations of the RET proto-oncogene have been identified in the germline DNA of patients with familial MTC syndromes. Genetic testing can identify patients affected by multiple endocrine neoplasia types IIA and IIB and familial MTC, allowing early diagnosis and possible cure. Surgical treatment is total thyroidectomy. Plasma calcitonin measurements are excellent markers for postoperative follow-up. Adjunctive therapy includes radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The overall prognosis is worse than papillary thyroid carcinoma.;Recent advances in genetic testing allow early diagnosis and treatment of familial MTC syndromes.

RET expression is restricted to normal and malignant cells of neural crest origin, such as human neuroblastoma cells. To better understand the role of the activated RET oncogene in neural crest cells, we transfected two adherent human neuroblastoma tumor cell lines with oncogenic MEN2 mutant RET cDNAs. Transfectant clones from both cell lines overexpressing MEN2B RET demonstrated a marked increase in the cell fraction growing in suspension. Both control and MEN2B cells formed tumors at the site of injection in all cases. However, mice injected with MEN2B cells developed lung metastases at a much higher frequency than control mice. Only RET protein derived from MEN2A transfectant cells had increased autokinase activity, whereas MEN2B transfectant cells demonstrated selective activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, Jun kinase-1 (Jnk1).

Exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the RET gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Sixty-seven people were found to carry pathogenic, germline mutations in the RET gene. In exon 10, C609F, C609R and C609Y (3 families), C618G, C618F (2 families), and C620G (4 families) mutations were identified. In exon 11, C634R (8 families) and C649L mutations (1 patient) were found. Five families carried Y791F mutation in exon 13. One patient with PTC revealed the presence of a Y791F mutation. In 3 families, exon 14 of the RET gene harbored the following mutations: V804L (1 patient), E819K (1 patient) and R844Q (1 patient). In 1 family, the S891A mutation was identified in exon 15, 3 families were found to carry mutations in exon16, R912P in 1 family and M918T in 2 families. In summary, of the 235 patients affected by MTC, 46 (19.6%) carried pathogenic RET gene mutations, 1 patient with RET mutation had kidney carcinoma, and 1 had PTC. The results show the occurrence of a variety of mutations prevalent in patients with MTC in the population of Central Poland.

These markers are thought to be useful in determining a molecular-based diagnosis of MTC. We examined the expression levels of PGP9.5 mRNA in 80 thyroid tissues using real-time quantitative reverse transcription (RT-PCR) and found that PGP9.5 mRNA was overexpressed in all 11 MTCs examined, both hereditary and sporadic, but not in other histological tumour types. Furthermore, by RT-PCR, PGP9.5 mRNA was detected only in aspirates from three medullary carcinomas, and not in aspirates from other tumour types.

Ct and CEA levels remained undetectable in four patients; recurrence was indicated in one patient after 10 years of follow-up by routine anatomic imaging and increased CEA levels, and Ct levels became slightly elevated during follow-up, despite massive tumor load, in the remaining two patients. The diagnosis of MTC was confirmed by positive immunohistochemistry for Ct, CEA, and chromogranin A. A high Ki67 proliferation index (PI) (three patients) and a high proportion of RET 918-mutated cells (four patients), as well as poorly differentiated histology, were associated with aggressive biological behavior of the MTC. The prognosis for nonsecretory MTC varied between long-term survival (12.5 years) and rapid progression leading to death within 1.75 years after diagnosis.;The prevalence of nonsecretory MTC was low (0.83% of patients with MTC). Diagnosis was often made at a clinically advanced tumor stage.

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), a neoplasm of thyroid C-cells, is characterized by dominant activating mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. Currently therapy is restricted to surgical removal of all neoplastic tissue lacking alternative forms of treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Therefore MTC is a particularly attractive target for gene therapeutic approaches. Many promising gene therapy strategies have been used in various animal models of MTC, showing enhanced antitumoral efficacy, and these will hopefully extend our current standard of care in the future. These approaches can tentatively be subdivided into four groups: (a) Inhibition of oncogenic RET signaling, (b) suicide gene therapy, (c) immunotherapy, and (d) combination of immunotherapy and suicide approaches. To block oncogenic signal transduction dominant-negative RET mutants were delivered into tumor cells and found to possess strong antineoplastic activity, including tumor growth suppression and increased animal survival. Suicide gene therapeutic approaches applied to MTC treatment featured either gene transfer of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase with concomitant application of ganciclovir or delivery of nitric oxide synthase II. Here antitumor effects were attributed to the occurrence of substantial bystander activities. Immunotherapy approaches comprised stimulation of immune response by delivery of interleukin 2 or 12. Finally, treatment with herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir in combination with interleukin 2 was found to be superior over either treatment alone. This review discusses the various gene therapeutic approaches applied to MTC treatment in detail, gives an overview on the diverse vector systems used to achieve efficient transduction of thyroid cancer cells, and points out the strategies employed to accomplish target cell selective gene expression thereby contributing to enhanced safety of gene therapy for MTC",

MTC accounts for 0.6% of all thyroid cancers and incidence of MTC increased steadily between 1997 and 2011 in Korea. It occurs either sporadically or in a hereditary form based on germline rearranged during transfection (RET) mutations. MTC can be cured only by complete resection of the thyroid tumor and any loco-regional metastases. The most appropriate treatment is still less clear in patients with residual or recurrent disease after initial surgery or those with distant metastases because most patients even with metastatic disease have indolent courses with slow progression for several years and MTC is not responsive to either radioactive iodine therapy or thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression. Recently, two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), vandetanib and cabozantinib, are approved for use in patients with advanced, metastatic or progressive MTC. In this review, we summarize the current approach according to revised American Thyroid Association guidelines and recent advances in systemic treatment such as TKIs for patients with persistent or recurrent MTC after surgery.",

Seventy members were studied and DNA analysis for RET mutations was performed in fifty-eight of them. Exons 10, 11, 13, 14 and 16 of the RET proto-oncogene were analyzed by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, direct DNA sequencing and/or restriction enzyme analysis. No mutations of the RET proto-oncogene were identified in 1 of 9 families with MEN 2A and in the 3 families with FMTC. In 7 MEN 2A families, the mutation was demonstrated in codon 634 and in 1 family it was demonstrated in codon 620. There was a low frequency, about 8%, of hyperparathyroidism associated with MEN 2A. The specific causative mutations for pararthyroid disease were C634R or C634Y. Among the MEN 2A individuals there was one case with de novo C634R mutation and one case, C634Y, with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis which predated by 24 years the diagnosis of MEN 2A. In 2 children who were MEN 2A gene carriers, microscopic medullary thyroid carcinomas were found. These data show a low frequency of hyperparathyroidism in our cases and provide further evidence that individuals with C634R as well as with C634Y mutations of the RET proto-oncogene could be at risk for parathyroid disease. Cutaneous lichen amyloidosis could be an early feature of MEN 2A. Additionally, direct DNA testing provided an opportunity to resect medullary thyroid carcinoma at an early stage.",

The close proximity to the plasma membrane of the affected cysteine residues prompted us to investigate the possible role of the transmembrane (TM) domain of RET (RET-TM) in receptor-receptor interactions underlying dimer formation. Strong self-association of the RET-TM was observed in a biological membrane. Mutagenesis studies indicated the involvement of the evolutionary conserved residues Ser-649 and Ser-653 in RET-TM oligomerization. Unexpectedly, RET-TM interactions were also abrogated in the A639G/A641R double mutant, first identified in a sporadic case of MTC. In agreement with this, no transforming activity could be detected in full-length RET carrying the A639G and A641R mutations, which remained fully responsive to glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) stimulation. When introduced in the context of C634R - a cysteine replacement that is prevalent in MEN2A cases - the A639G/A641R mutations significantly reduced dimer formation and transforming activity in this otherwise highly oncogenic RET variant. These data suggest that a strong propensity to self-association in the RET-TM underlies - and may be required for - dimer formation and oncogenic activation of juxtamembrane cysteine mutants of RET, and explains the close proximity to the plasma membrane of cysteine residues implicated in MEN2A and MTC syndromes.",

Somatic rearrangements of the RET gene generating the chimeric RET/papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) oncogenes are the predominant molecular lesions associated with papillary carcinoma, the most frequent thyroid malignancy in humans. Oncogenic mutations cause constitutive activation of the kinase function of RET, which, in turn, results in the autophosphorylation of RET tyrosine residues critical for signaling. In vitro kinase assays previously revealed six putative RET autophosphorylation sites. The aim of the present study was to assess the phosphorylation of two such residues, tyrosines 1015 and 1062 (Y1015 and Y1062), in the in vivo signaling of RET and RET-derived oncogenes. Using phosphorylated RET-specific antibodies, we demonstrate that both Y1015 and Y1062 are rapidly phosphorylated upon ligand triggering of RET. Moreover, regardless of the nature of the underlying activating mutation, the concomitant phosphorylation of Y1015 and Y1062 is a common feature of the various oncogenic RET products (MEN2A, MEN2B, and PTC). This study shows that Ab-pY1062 is a useful tool with which to detect activated RET in human tumor cells and surgical samples. Finally, the microinjection of Ab-pY1062 antibodies into living cells demonstrates that Ret/PTC1 signaling is required to maintain the mitogenesis of a human carcinoma cell line expressing the Ret/PTC1 oncoprotein.",

Cytogenetic analyses of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), a neoplasm which originates from thyrocytes, have revealed that somatic rearrangements of the RET gene are involved in the etiology of a significant proportion of this tumour. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) which arises from neural-crest derived C-cells is the cardinal disease feature of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), a dominantly inherited cancer syndrome. Recent studies have provided evidence that germline mutations of the RET gene are the underlying genetic events responsible for MEN 2. This review focuses on the role of RET mutations in the pathogenesis of PTC and MTC and summarizes our present knowledge on the consequences of these alterations on the RET tyrosine kinase function. We further describe a transgenic mouse model for hereditary MTC.

It can occur either alone or as the thyroid manifestation of MEN 2 syndromes; the disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with age-related penetrance. The treatment of choice is surgery. Early diagnosis and an adeguate initial operation provide the best chance of cure. Hence, the diagnosis should be made preoperatively. Genetic testing can identify almost all affected individuals with hereditary disease and permits prophylactic/early thyroidectomy in gene carriers. Total thyroidectomy and lymphadenectomy of the cervicocentral compartment is mandatory in all patients. In addition, bilateral dissection of the cervicolateral compartment should be done in all cases with more than microscopic disease. Plasma calcitonin is an excellent marker for postoperative follow-up. Treatment of persistent/recurrent disease is primarily surgical. Hence, a reoperative cervical lymphadenectomy should be considered in patients with persistently elevated calcitonin levels and no signs of distant metastases.

A germline codon Cys618 to Ser mutation in the RET proto-oncogene was recently identified in this family. The disease phenotype associated with this mutation was compared with that of Cys634 mutations in some other large MEN 2A families.;The distinct course of disease in the family described here is similar to that in other FMTC families and MEN 2A families with a Cys618 mutation of the RET gene, but clearly different from that in families with a Cys634 mutation. The frequency of pheochromocytomas and parathyroid disease is clearly lower, whereas cure rates and life expectancy are higher. However, in families with a Cys618 mutation, pheochromocytoma and parathyroid disease do occur.;In FMTC families with cysteine codon mutations of the RET proto-oncogene, screening for other endocrinopathies is mandatory, since these may not be MTC-only families.

Across sporadic and hereditary groups, there was a similar and overlapping pattern of predominant allelic loss. There were 29 regions containing at least 30% CNA in the 30 tumor samples. The most frequent allelic loss occurred in four loci, 7q36.1, 12p13.31, 13q12.11, and 19p13.3-11. No regions were found to be uniquely altered in the hereditary tumors. There were 21 CNA specific to sporadic MTC, with loss of 11q23.3 uniquely altered in RET negative tumors. Pathway analysis found cellular growth and proliferation as the most significant overall target, and cell death as the most significant pathway targeted in sporadic MTC.;Our findings underscore the importance of candidate tumor suppressor genes together with RET alterations in MTCs.

To expedite rapid screening of populations at risk of MEN 2a or FMTC, we developed a PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) strategy that detects polymorphisms occurring at all five Cys codons in both RET exons using identical gel conditions. In this report, the screening results from DGGE analysis of 15 distinct MEN 2a and FMTC mutations are shown. Each mutation generated a clearly distinguishable and unique homo- and heteroduplex band pattern. Given the highly efficient, reproducible, and sensitive nature of this approach, DGGE is particularly appropriate for rapid, large-scale screening of patients.

Comprehensive immunohistochemical investigations were performed to elaborate markers which could be useful for differentiating between MTC metastases and pheochromocytoma, respectively. Calcitonin and CEA, in particular cytokeratins and trefoil factor family 1 (TFF1), were detectable exclusively in MTC, whereas all the other markers revealed a comparable expression in both MTC and pheochromocytoma. The only clues that could indicate a potential malignant course were size, a lack of sustentacular cells and hyaline globules, and a focal spindle cell pattern in pheochromocytoma. Owing to a wide agreement in cellular differentiation and a lack of specific, routinely applicable markers for pheochromocytomas, a comprehensive and goal-directed immunohistochemistry is required to rule out pheochromocytoma metastasis in patients with MEN2a.

Nevertheless, not all patients with the progressive MTC respond to these drugs, requiring the development of additional therapeutic modalities that have distinct activity. Previously, we reported that expression of activated Ras or Raf in the human MTC cell lines, TT and MZ-CRC-1, can induce growth arrest and RET downregulation via a leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-mediated autocrine/paracrine loop. In this study, we aimed to evaluate bacterially-produced recombinant human LIF for its efficacy to suppress human MTC xenografts in mice. Here, we report that, consistent with its effects in vitro, locally or systemically administered recombinant LIF effectively suppressed growth of TT and MZ-CRC-1 xenografts in mice. Further, as predicted from its effects in TT and MZ-CRC-1 cell cultures in vitro, recombinant LIF activated the JAK/STAT pathway and downregulated RET and E2F1 expression in tumors in mice.

A genotype - phenotype correlation has been established, showing clustering of mutations in exons 10 and 11 in classical MEN 2 A syndrome, in exon 16 codon 918 in MEN 2 B syndrome and in exons 13-15 in familial MTC. A line of evidence suggested that the development and the aggressiveness of MTC in the different cancer syndromes is variable. Aim of this study was to compare the phenotype of exon 13-15 mutations with that of exon 11 mutation and possibly draw therapeutical consequences.;We compared the phenotype of 47 patients with mutations in exon 13-15 with 66 patients with exon 11, codon 634 mutation, the classical MEN2A. Patients were further subdivided as index and screening patients.;Mean age of 19 index patients with codon 790, 791, 804 or 891 mutation was significant higher compared with 18 index patients with codon 634 mutation (mean age at diagnosis 50+/-12 years; range 30-69 y vs mean age 31+/-9 years; range 17-49 y), tumor stage at operation was favourable (C-cell hyperplasia n = 1; stage I n = 8; II n = 3; III n = 2; IV n = 2; no operation n = 1; no information n = 2 vs stage I n = 3; stage II n = 6; stage III n = 4, no information n =5), cure rate was better (56 % vs 38 %) and the death rate was lower (n = 2 vs n = 4). In screening patients no differences concerning the age, tumor stage, cure and death rate between patients with exons 13-15 and codon 634 mutations were seen.;MTC in patients with exon 790, 791, 804, 891 mutations displayed a late onset and an indolent course compared to codon 634 mutation, this has to be taken into account when recommending timing and extent of prophylactic surgery.",

Pathologic examination of the resected specimen will not always be able to confirm the diagnosis, leaving the surgeon with an uncertainty as to what type of resection is best for the patient. The following report describes the case of a 58-year-old man with the rare diagnosis of paraganglioma-like MTC.;The patient presented with markedly elevated calcitonin (CT) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. A 1-cm tumor was detected in the right lobe of the thyroid. Based on the clinical diagnosis of MTC, we performed a total thyroidectomy with lymphadenectomy of the central and right lateral compartments. Paraffin sections of the resected specimen were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemically characterized using antibodies to CT, CEA, chromogranin A, thyroglobulin, synaptophysin, sustentacular cells (SCs), low- and high-molecular cytokeratins (CK 5/6, 7, 18, 20), epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGFR), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), bcl-2, Melan A, C-kit, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and galectin-3. The patient's blood and tumor tissue were examined for mutations in the RET-protooncogene.;H&E staining of both frozen and permanent sections was unable to differentiate benign from malignant tissue. Typical morphologic characteristics for MTC were completely absent. Only the additional finding of positivity for synaptophysin and numerous SC cells visible in-between neoplastic cells made the diagnosis of paraganglioma-like MTC possible. Sequencing of the RET proto-oncogene revealed no mutations.;There are subgroups of MTC that present clinically similar to classic MTC, but in which missing typical morphologic characteristics make histopathology diagnosis difficult. In these cases, diagnosis, operative decisions, and follow-up strategies should be based on preoperative biochemical markers, imaging findings, and clinical parameters in accordance to the guidelines for classic MTC.",

Not all patients with progressive MTC respond to current therapy inhibiting RET, demanding additional therapeutic strategies. We recently demonstrated that disrupting mitochondrial metabolism using a mitochondria-targeted agent or by depleting a mitochondrial chaperone effectively suppressed human MTC cells in culture and in mouse xenografts by inducing apoptosis and RET downregulation. These observations led us to hypothesize that mitochondria are potential therapeutic targets for MTC. This study further tests this hypothesis using1-ethyl-2-[[3-ethyl-5-(3-methylbenzothiazolin-2-yliden)]-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidenemethyl] pyridinium chloride (MKT-077), a water-soluble rhodocyanine dye analogue, which can selectively accumulate in mitochondria.;The effects of MKT-077 on cell proliferation, survival, expression of RET and tumor protein 53 (TP53), and mitochondrial activity were determined in the human MTC lines in culture and in mouse xenografts.;MKT-077 induced cell cycle arrest in TT and MZ-CRC-1. Intriguingly, MKT-077 also induced RET downregulation and strong cell death responses in TT cells, but not in MZ-CRC-1 cells. This discrepancy was mainly due to the difference between the capacities of these cell lines to retain MKT-077 in mitochondria. The cytotoxicity of MKT-077 in TT cells was mainly attributed to oxidative stress while being independent of TP53. MKT-077 also effectively suppressed tumor growth of TT xenografts.;MKT-077 can suppress cell survival of certain MTC subtypes by accumulating in mitochondria and interfering with mitochondrial activity although it can also suppress cell proliferation via other mechanisms. These results consistently support the hypothesis that mitochondrial targeting has therapeutic potential for MTC.",

We hypothesized that adhesion-dependent signaling might be deranged in MTC cells.;Indirect immunofluorescence was used to label beta(1) integrin, FAK, paxillin, and p130CAS. Rhodamine-labeled phalloidin was used to visualize actin microfilaments. Phosphorylated protein was detected by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting for phosphotyrosine.

However a clear difference was noted between invasiveness on growth factor depleted Matrigel and regular Matrigel.;In MTC cells, focal adhesions are not seen in response to interaction with extracellular matrix. Consistent with this failure, actin microfilaments are absent or poorly formed and invasion is weak.

Enlarged lymph nodes were dissected selectively. The main outcome measure was carcinoma-specific survival.;In sporadic MTC, ten-year carcinoma-specific survival was 57.9% (95% CI 39.1%-76.7%) and ten-year survival after reoperation due to lymphatic node recurrence was 51.4% (CI 18.7%-84.2%).

Because of similarities in involvement of the two tyrosine kinases RET (rearranged during transfection) and NTRK1 in the pathogenesis of PTC, the obvious parallels between RET and NTRK1 and between PTC and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), NTRK1 seemed to be an excellent candidate gene to play a role in the genesis of MTC. Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis of 16 exons of NTRK1, from 31 sporadic MTC, revealed variants in five exons (exons 4 and 14-17). Sequence analysis demonstrated one sequence variant each in exons 4, 14, 16, and 17, and four different variants in exon 15. Differential restriction enzyme digestion specific for each variant confirmed the sequencing results. All variants were also present in the corresponding germline DNA. Interestingly, the sequence variants at codon 604 (c1810C>T) and codon 613 (c1838G>T) ofexon 15 always occurred together and might represent linkage disequilibrium. The frequencies of the sequence variants in germline DNA from patients with sporadic MTC did not differ significantly from those in a race-matched control group.

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) comprises approximately 4% of all malignant thyroid neoplasms. Although the majority of patients have a good prognosis, a subgroup of patients develops progressive disease and requires systemic therapy. Here, we focused on the current MTC therapeutic approaches and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of molecular targeted therapies.;Targeted molecular therapies that inhibit RET and other tyrosine kinase receptors involved in angiogenesis have been shown to improve progression-free survival in patients with advanced MTC. Two drugs, vandetanib and cabozantinib, have been approved for the treatment of progressive or symptomatic MTC, and several others have exhibited variable efficacy. No tyrosine kinase inhibitor has been shown to improve survival. Although no definitive recommendation can currently be made, cumulative data indicate that knowledge of the tumor mutational profile may facilitate improvements in targeted therapy for MTC.;Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of progressive MTC. Nevertheless, it is not clear who will benefit the most from therapy, and the decision regarding when and how to initiate the treatment should be made based on the patient's medical history and tumor behavior. Hopefully, in the near future, molecular profiling of MTC can be used to determine the most effective molecular therapeutic target.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Successful treatment of MTC depends heavily on early diagnosis and treatment. Often, this is not possible for sporadic MTC; however, genetic testing for hereditary MTC makes this possible if genetic carriers have surgery before C cells undergo malignant transformation. All patients who have MTC should be tested for RET mutations, including putative sporadic cases. The leukocytes of suspected carriers and sporadic MTC cases should be tested for MEN2-associated germ-line mutations by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the appropriate RET gene exons, including 10, 11,13, 14, 15, and 16 (see Table I). When a RET mutation is found, all first-degree relatives must be screened to determine which individuals carry the gene. If these exons are negative, the other 15 should be sequenced because a small risk of hereditary MTC remains if no germ-line mutation is found. The probability that a first-degree relative will inherit an autosomal dominant gene for MTC from an individual who has sporadic MTC in whom no germ-line mutation is found is 0.18% . Patients who have MEN2B or RET codon 883 or 918 mutation should have a total thyroidectomy within the first 6 months of life, preferably within the first month of life. Patients who have 634 mutations, which account for approximately 70% of all MTC mutations, should undergo thyroidectomy by age 5 years. The recommendations for the timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy are not consistent for the less common mutations (see Table 2). There is a balance between performing prophylactic thyroidectomy earlier than at the youngest age at with MTC has been reported to occur for a specific RET mutation (see Fig. 3 and Table 2) and the complications of thyroidectomy, including permanent hypoparathyroidism and laryngeal nerve damage. Preoperative measurement of plasma free metanephrine and neck ultrasonography always should be done if the diagnosis of MTC is known preoperatively. Initial treatment of MTC is total thyroidectomy, regardless of its genetic type or putative sporadic nature, because surgery offers the only chance for a cure. Treatment with 1311 has no place in the management of MTC. Plasma CT measurements provide an accurate estimate of tumor burden and are especially useful in identifying patients who have residual tumor. Pentagastrin- or calcium-stimulated plasma CT testing is useful in identifying CCH or early MTC in carriers of RET mutations that are associated with late onset MTC. Pheochromocytoma may occur before or after MTC and is an important cause of mortality, even in young patients. HPT is an important aspect of MEN2A and requires surgery according to current guidelines for the management of primary HPT. Early thyroidectomy and appropriate management of pheochromocytoma clearly have modified the course of this disease, but more research is necessary in kindreds who have rare MTC mutations. Moreover, new treatments for widespread MTC are necessary because current chemotherapy agents offer little benefit. New drugs that lock the action of tyrosine kinase offer some hope.",

Lymph node metastases were present in 12/20 patients, and presumable distant metastases in 2/20; in contrast, we observed a carrier of up to 87 years of age without evidence of MTC.

Our results suggest that the restriction fragment length polymorphism method can be used to identify individuals at risk within MEN2A families. They may then be followed by conventional endocrine methods for the onset of neoplastic changes, limiting the risk of subsequent metastatic disease. The method also permits the exclusion of further screening for family members at very low risk.

We report the detection and functional studies of a deletion/insertion in exon 11 (c.2646delGinsTTCT) associated with FMTC.

The mutation displayed a transforming activity stronger than Ret wild type (Ret-WT) at the focus formation assay and functional analyses after transient and stable transfection revealed an increased autophosphorylation, indicating the constitutive activation of the receptor. The transforming activity may be favoured by an increased stabilization of the fully mature form of the mutant receptor.

Computational analysis predicted nonconservative alterations in the mutant protein consistent with a possible modification of the conformation of the receptor.

Stimulated preoperative calcitonin levels were confounding and not useful for differentiating CCH from MTC. None of patients in whom cervical dissection was done (9/16) presented lymph node metastases, including the oldest ones. All patients but the older ones were biochemically cured after a mean of 5 years of follow-up.;Prophylactic total thyroidectomy should be done early in life because there is an age-dependent progression from HCC to MTC.

She was disease free after surgical resection. She also had bilateral pheochromocytomas and mucosal neuromas leading to the clinical diagnosis of MEN-2B. Genetic testing showed that the woman and her three children (3-5 years old) had the RET-A883F mutation. The children had near-normal calcitonin levels, and none had sonographic evidence of suspicious thyroid nodules or cervical lymphadenopathy.;A family with MEN-2B due to RET-A883F mutation displayed a less aggressive form of MTC than what is usually seen in patients with RET-M918T mutation.

This disorder is usually caused by the mutations of the rearranged during transfection protooncogene gene (RET) or the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 gene (NTRK1). To investigate the genetic cause in a Chinese Han family with MEN2A and the genotype-phenotype correlations, nine members belonging to 3 generations of MEN2A family with 5 affected subjects underwent genetic analysis. Standard GTG-banded karyotype analysis and sequencing of the RET and NTRK1 genes were performed to identify the genetic cause of this family. A heterozygous mutation p.Cys634Arg in the RET gene was identified in 5 patients with MEN2A and one asymptomatic family member. The phenotype of patients was that of classic MEN2A, characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma and phaeochromocytoma. The clinical features of all cases with RET mutations varied greatly, including onset age of clinical manifestations, severity and comorbidities. Thus, this study not only identified the hereditary nature of the MEN2A in the cases, but also discovered a family member harboring the same p.Cys634Arg mutation, who was unaware of his condition. These finding may provide new insights into the cause and diagnosis of MEN2A and have implications for genetic counseling.",

Oncogenic activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase encoding RET gene occurs typically by gene rearrangement in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) and by missense mutation in medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC). These genetic alterations lead to the expression of deregulated products characterized by ligand-independent activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of Ret. Such features suggest the possibility of using specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors to block the Ret oncoproteins signaling. The present report summarizes the cellular effects of the arylidene 2-indolinone Ret inhibitor RPI-1 (formerly Cpd1) on the human PTC cell line TPC-1 which spontaneously harbors the RET/PTC1 oncogene. The results provide evidence that RPI-1 is able to inhibit cell growth and to interfere with Ret/ptc1-driven signaling.

        "Doc_abstract":"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare tumor originating from thyroid parafollicular C cells, where, in the inherited form, constitutive activation of the RET protooncogene is responsible for unrestrained cell proliferation. We previously demonstrated that somatostatin (SRIF) reduces cell growth in the human MTC cell line TT, which expresses all SRIF receptor (SSTR) subtypes and responds differently to selective SSTR agonists. The antiproliferative mechanism of SRIF and its analogs in MTC is still unclear. Src homology-2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), is activated by somatotropin release-inhibiting factor and reduces mutated RET autophosphorylation in a heterologous system. In this study, we explore the role of PTP activation, in particular of SHP-1, in TT cells, where RET is constitutively activated. In TT cells, SRIF stimulated the PTP activity of SHP-1, which was associated with proliferation inhibition and with reduction in the MAPK pathway activation. Blockade of PTP activity with sodium orthovanadate induced cell proliferation and MAPK phosphorylation and blunted the inhibitory effects of SRIF. Moreover, SHP-1 associates with SSTR2 depending on its activation. By using a MAPK kinase inhibitor, we demonstrated that TT cell growth depends on MAPK pathway activation. Furthermore, in TT cells overexpressing SHP-1, cell proliferation and MAPK signaling were strongly down-regulated, whereas in TT cells transfected with a dominant negative form of SHP-1, cell proliferation and MAPK signaling were markedly induced. Our data demonstrate that SRIF inhibitory effects on TT cell proliferation are mediated, at least in part, by SHP-1, which acts through a MAPK-dependent mechanism.",

A germline RET mutation was also found in 36 of 37 patients with clinical evidence of hereditary MTC. The distribution of RET mutations in cysteine and noncysteine encoding codons was significantly different in the two groups of patients, with the prevalence of RET mutations in noncysteine codons being higher in MTC that presented as apparently sporadic (P < 0.0001). A total of 34 FMTCs (75.5% of all FMTC) arrived with apparent sporadic MTC, with no familial history of other MTC cases. According to genetic screening and clinical data, our 72 families were classified as follows: 45 FMTC (62.5%), 22 MEN 2A (30.5%), and five MEN 2B (7%).;In this large series of MTC, hereditary forms, mainly FMTC, were clinically unsuspected in 7.3% of apparently sporadic cases.

This is the first report of differential display using surgical specimens of a primary cancer and its metastases. Total RNA was extracted from tumor tissue of two patients with MTC associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN 2B) and sporadic MTC, respectively. Following reverse transcription (RT), the products were PCR-amplified and separated on a denaturating polyacrylamide gel. RT-PCR products demonstrating differential expression were reamplified and used as probes for Northern blot analysis. Six fragments for which differential expression was confirmed were cloned and sequenced. Resultant sequences were tested for homology to sequences in public data bases, and two novel MTC-derived fragments (MDF-1, MDF-2) were identified. Sensitivity of the method was confirmed by identification of a sequence encoding the calcitonin precursor flanking peptide which is expressed almost exclusively in MTC and normal thyroid C cells. Overexpression of the ribosomal genes S3a and P0 was found in the metastases. Recent reports suggest that components of the translational apparatus act as regulatory mediators of growth, proliferation, and neoplastic change.

First, we studied SDHD in two families with hereditary non-RET CCH and found no alterations related to the inheritance of this disease. Then, we investigated whether the H50R variant could be a risk factor in the sporadic development of MTC in both Spanish and English patients. We found no evidence that the presence of the H50R is strongly associated with the risk of sporadic MTC, although we did observe an association with age at diagnosis of MTC in Spanish H50R carriers that we did not find in English patients. Finally, we looked for evidence of CCH or any other thyroid disease in a panel of germ-line SDH (B or D) mutation carriers and found none. We conclude that SDHD variants do not constitute a risk factor for developing CCH or sporadic MTC.",

Primary treatment consists of surgical resection including a total thyroidectomy, central neck nodal dissection and functional lateral neck nodal dissections. Most patients with a palpable primary tumour have nodal disease at the time of operation, and nodal involvement is often bilateral.;adequate resection of the primary tumour and cervical lymph nodes is important to optimize outcome and minimize the risk of recurrent disease.

Here we show that stable expression of ret mutants (MEN2A and MEN2B alleles) in PC12 cells causes a dramatic conversion from a round to a flat morphology, accompanied by the induction of genes belonging to the early as well as the delayed response to nerve growth factor. However, in the transfected PC12 cells, the continuous expression of neuronal specific genes is not associated with the suppression of cell proliferation. Furthermore, expression of ret mutants renders PC12 cells unresponsive to nerve growth factor-induced inhibition of proliferation. These results suggest that induction of an aberrant pattern of differentiation, accompanied by unresponsiveness to growth-inhibitory physiological signals, may be part of the mechanism of action of activated ret alleles in the pathogenesis of neuroendocrine tumors associated with MEN2 syndromes.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid cancer is frequently associated with the oncogenic conversion of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase. RET gene rearrangements, which lead to the generation of chimeric RET/papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) oncogenes, occur in PTC, whereas RET point mutations occur in familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) and sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC). We showed previously that the expression of the receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase J (PTPRJ) is suppressed in neoplastically transformed follicular thyroid cells. We now report that PTPRJ coimmunoprecipitates with wild-type RET and with the MEN2A-associated RET(C634R) oncoprotein but not with the RET/PTC1 and RET-MEN2B isoforms. Using mutated forms of PTPRJ and RET-MEN2A, we show that the integrity of the respective catalytic domains is required for the PTPRJ/RET-MEN2A interaction. PTPRJ expression induces dephosphorylation of the RET(C634R) and, probably via an indirect mechanism, RET/PTC1 oncoproteins on two key RET autophosphorylation sites (Tyr1062 and Tyr905). This results in a significant decrease of RET-induced Shc and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation levels. In line with this finding, adoptive PTPRJ expression reduced the oncogenic activity of RET(C634R) in an in vitro focus formation assay of NIH3T3 cells. As expected from the coimmunoprecipitation results, the RET(M918T) oncoprotein, which is associated to MEN2B and sporadic MTC, was resistant to the dephosphorylating activity of PTPRJ. Taken together, these findings identify RET as a novel substrate of PTPRJ and suggest that PTPRJ expression levels may affect tumor phenotype associated with RET/PTC1 and RET(C634R) mutants. On the other hand, resistance to PTPRJ may be part of the mechanism of RET oncogenic conversion secondary to the M918T mutation.",

The compound hampered HSP90/RET interaction and stabilized RET binding to HSP70, leading to the recruitment of the HSP70-associated E3 ligase C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein. In turn, C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein polyubiquitinated RET, promoting its proteasomal degradation. 17-AAG blocked RET downstream effectors and RET-dependent transcriptional activation of gene promoters. In human MTC cells carrying oncogenic RET mutants, HSP90 inhibition induced receptor degradation and signaling hindrance leading to cell cycle arrest.;RET and MEN2-associated RET mutants rely on HSP90 for protein stability, and HSP90 blockade by 17-AAG promotes RET degradation.",

Laboratory studies revealed an elevated 24-h urine-free cortisol (780 micro g/d), epinephrine (66 micro g/d), and calcium (558 mg/d). Baseline serum cortisol was 23.9 micro g/dl and decreased to 12.9 and 4.5 micro g/dl after 2 mg and 8 mg dexamethasone suppression, respectively. Plasma ACTH was 170 pg/ml and decreased to 75 and 24 pg/ml after dexamethasone. Bone density t-score was -4.3 (trochanter). Computed tomography scans showed multiple cervical nodes and 2-cm right adrenal nodule. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a prominent, homogeneous pituitary; the adrenal MRI scan was not typical for a pheochromocytoma. Serum CRH was less than 6.6 pg/ml. Bilateral adrenalectomy revealed two adjacent right adrenal pheochromocytomas and corrected the elevated urine cortisol (30 micro g/d), epinephrine (0 micro g/d), and calcium (281 mg/d) but not plasma ACTH (125 pg/ml). Neck dissection reduced calcitonin by 96% (5300 to 120 pg/ml) and ACTH by 91% (125 to 11 pg/ml). Carcinoembryonic antigen was reduced from 32.0 to 2.3 ng/ml. Immunohistochemical stain was negative for ACTH in the MTC-positive lymph nodes and the pheochromocytoma. Proopiomelanocortin mRNA by in situ hybridization was positive in the MTC but not in the pheochromocytoma. A repeat pituitary MRI scan was normal. The differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome in this case included pituitary disease or ectopic ACTH, either from medullary thyroid carcinoma or pheochromocytoma.

Twenty healthy individuals and 20 MTC patients with mildly or moderately increased basal CT serum concentrations underwent the pentagastrin and omeprazole tests.;In MTC patients, the pentagastrin test produced a significantly higher increase in serum CT than did omeprazole.

No adverse effects were observed during the omeprazole test. A significant direct correlation was recorded between CT% (ratio of CT peak to basal value x 100) and GT% (ratio of GT peak to basal value x 100) during the omeprazole test in MTC patients (r = 0.73; P <0.001).;In spite of several adverse effects, pentagastrin remains the best provocative test for the diagnosis of MTC.

Because of the increased metastatic rates in certain genetic backgrounds, early diagnosis and treatment are essential to improved patient outcomes. Our objective was to summarize recent findings related to the genetics, diagnosis, and management of MTC and PHEO/PGL.;A literature review was performed.;MTC is primarily associated with mutations in the rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene. Determining the specific genetic mutation can guide patient management and screening. Early detection and appropriate surgical management of MTC is critical to prevent or limit metastatic spread, as treatment options for patients with metastatic disease are limited. PHEO/PGL also has a strong genetic component, with approximately 50% of cases linked to germline and somatic mutations in 15 genes. Although most PHEO/PGLs are benign, factors such as genetic background, size, tumor location, and high methoxytyramine levels are associated with higher rates of metastatic disease. The state-of-the-art diagnosis and localization of PHEO/PGLs is based on measurement of plasma metanephrines and methoxytyramine and functional imaging studies. For both PHEO/PGL and MTC, surgery is the only curative treatment. Treatment options for patients with metastatic disease are limited.;As genetic testing becomes more widely available, the diagnosis of MTC and PHEO/PGL will be made earlier due to routine screening of at-risk patients. In addition, continued advances in basic science, diagnostic methods, and imaging techniques will improve understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases and facilitate the introduction of novel treatment strategies for patients with metastatic disease.",

Since calcitonin stimulation test indicated positive result, total thyroidectomy was performed 1 year after the bilateral adrenalectomy, and C-cell hyperplasia was diagnosed by histopathological examination. Our report suggests that cases with S891A mutation, akin to those with other RET mutations, require screening for pheochromocytoma.

Single strand conformational variants (SSCVs) in exons 7 and 8 of the RET proto-oncogene were identified in eight MEN 2A and four FMTC families. The variants were observed only in the DNA of individuals who were either affected or who had inherited the MEN2A or FMTC allele as determined by haplotyping experiments.

Six of the seven mutations are located in exon 7. A single mutation was found in exon 8. Variants were not detected in four MEN 2B families studied for all exon assays available, nor were they detectable in 16 cases of well documented sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma or pheochromocytoma that were tested for exon 7 variants.

The identification of mutations associated with these syndromes has led to genetic testing to identify patients at risk for MEN 2 and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma and subsequent implementation of prophylactic thyroidectomy in mutation carriers.

We report a case of synchronous MTC and PTC in a patient with germline RET mutation, and investigate the molecular pathogenesis of these two tumors. A 48-year-old man presented with cervical lymphadenopathy and was found to have metastatic MTC involving cervical and mediastinal lymph nodes. He underwent thyroidectomy and debulking of metastatic disease. The resected thyroid showed bilateral MTC and a 1-cm PTC. His lymph node metastases were predominantly MTC along with a small focus of metastatic PTC. Molecular testing using peripheral blood revealed a germline RET point mutation (Val804Met). Both tumors were analyzed for the BRAF (Val600Glu) mutation and the RET/PTC1 translocation. The PTC was positive for the BRAF mutation but negative for RET/PTC1. The MTC was negative for both abnormalities. We conclude that the MTC was caused by the germline RET mutation, while the PTC was caused by a somatic BRAF mutation. The occurrence of PTC in patients with germline RET mutations appears to be purely coincidental.",

Here we show that nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB is activated in RET-associated C-cell carcinoma specimens. TT cells, a human MTC cell line expressing MEN 2A type RET, display transcriptionally active RelA(p65) in the nucleus. NF-kappaB activity in these cells is attributable to constitutive IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity and high turn over of IkappaBalpha. RET harboring the mutations C634R (MEN 2A) or M918T (MEN 2B), in contrast to wild-type RET, activates a NF-kappaB-dependent reporter construct upon transient transfection in HeLa cells. We show that the prototype RET mutation C634R enhances phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha by IKKbeta but not by IKKalpha. RET-induced NF-kappaB and IKKbeta activity requires Ras function but does neither involve the classical mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase nor the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathways. In contrast, RET-induced NF-kappaB activity is dependent on Raf and MEKK1. Inhibition of constitutive NF-kappaB activity results in cell death of TT cells and blocks focus formation induced by oncogenic forms of RET in NIH 3T3 cells. These results suggest that RET-mediated carcinogenesis critically depends on IKK activity and subsequent NF-kappaB activation.",

We compared the reliability of biochemical tests with that of DNA analysis in identifying carriers of the MEN2A gene.;Starting in 1975, we screened 300 subjects in four large families with MEN-2A for expression of the disease, using measurements of plasma calcitonin after stimulation with pentagastrin or calcium and urinary excretion of catecholamines and catecholamine metabolites. We tested for carrier status by DNA analysis, including linkage analysis, and more recently by analysis of mutations in the RET gene.;Of 80 MEN2A gene carriers (in 61 of whom carrier status was proved by DNA analysis), 66 had abnormal plasma calcitonin values and medullary thyroid carcinoma. Fourteen young carriers had normal results of plasma calcitonin tests. In 8 of these 14, thyroidectomy revealed small foci of medullary thyroid carcinoma; the remaining 6 have not yet been operated on. Of the other 220 family members, 68 were found by DNA analysis not to carry the MEN2A gene.

MEN2A is comprised of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and parathyroid hyperplasia.

Both pheochromocytomas and ganglioneuromas originate from neural crest cells. Interestingly, two mouse models of MEN2B exhibit adrenal ganglioneuroma formation. One mouse model develops only ganglioneuromas (but not pheochromocytomas) and expresses only one of the oncogenic RET isoforms. The other mouse model, created by site-directed mutagenesis to simulate the most common human mutation, develops both ganglioneuromas and pheochromocytomas.;Given our two cases, our current understanding of the mouse models, and the common origins of all these tumor cell types, we recommend including ganglioneuromas as a rare, but not unexpected, component of the MEN2 syndromes.",

Therefore, the clinical management of patients with sporadic CCH is controversial. To evaluate the malignant potential of sporadic CCHs, pure laser-microdissected C-cell populations of 24 CCH cases, either reactive or associated with nonfamilial MTC, were analyzed for MTC-associated protein neural cell adhesion molecule expression and RET point mutations in exons 10, 11, 15, and 16, by using immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism/heteroduplex electrophoresis/direct sequencing, respectively. No RET mutations were found in any of the 24 CCH cases, whereas M918T mutation was detected in three concomitant MTCs. Neural cell adhesion molecule was immunoreactive in the majority of CCH associated with MTC even in the absence of morphological atypia, but not in reactive forms.

In the infant none of the MEN2B characteristics are present, except by early gastrointestinal dysfunction caused by intestinal neuromas.

Here we report four cases of MEN2B in which the late diagnosis had a significant impact in clinical evolution and, potentially, in overall survival.;We report four cases, 2 men and 2 women, with differences in their phenotypes and with a late diagnosis. The first case has a history of severe gastrointestinal obstruction requiring a surgery intervention two days after his birth. The second told had nodules in the oral mucosa and constipation since childhood. The third case referred a history of constipation from birth until 5 months of life. The fourth has had a history of chronic constipation since childhood.;New concepts have emerged since the RET oncogene was identified in 1993 as the responsible gene for hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma. The majority of MEN2B individuals have M918T mutation in the exon 16 of RET, with a few cases having a mutation A883F or the association of V804M with E805K, Y806C or S904C mutations. The consensus classifies the RET mutation in codon 918 as of highest risk and recommends total thyroidectomy and central lymph node dissection until 6 months after birth. A fast and precise diagnosis is essential to reach these goals. The identification of early manifestations such as intestinal ganglioneuromatosis and oral mucosal neuromas should prompt the physician to initiate an investigation for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B.;The diagnosis of MEN2B is very important to allow appropriate investigation of associated diseases and to allow counseling and appropriate screening of relatives for a RET mutation.

Furthermore, it would appear that C630R mirrors C634R in penetrance (100% in this family) and in early age of onset of MTC, although paradoxically, no pheochromocytomas and hyperparathyroidism have developed. In addition to recommending RET testing before 5 years of age; we also can postulate that codon 630 may be the key point along the extracellular domain, important in the tissue-specific penetrance.",

Activation of RET is a mechanism of oncogenesis in medullary thyroid carcinomas where both germline and sporadic activating somatic mutations are prevalent. At present, there are no known specific RET inhibitors in clinical development, although many potent inhibitors of RET have been opportunistically identified through selectivity profiling of compounds initially designed to target other tyrosine kinases. Vandetanib and cabozantinib, both multi-kinase inhibitors with RET activity, are approved for use in medullary thyroid carcinoma, but additional pharmacological activities, most notably inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor - VEGFR2 (KDR), lead to dose-limiting toxicity. The recent identification of RET fusions present in ~1% of lung adenocarcinoma patients has renewed interest in the identification and development of more selective RET inhibitors lacking the toxicities associated with the current treatments. In an earlier publication [Newton et al, 2016; 1] we reported the discovery of a series of 2-substituted phenol quinazolines as potent and selective RET kinase inhibitors. Here we describe the development of the robust screening cascade which allowed the identification and advancement of this chemical series.  Furthermore we have profiled a panel of RET-active clinical compounds both to validate the cascade and to confirm that none display a RET-selective target profile.

Recently, linkage of an incompletely penetrant, dominant form of HSCR was reported, followed by identification of mutations in the RET receptor tyrosine kinase. To determine the frequency of RET mutations in HSCR and correlate genotype with phenotype, we have screened for mutations among 80 HSCR probands representing a wide range of phenotypes and family structures. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of RET's 20 exons for mutations among probands revealed eight putative mutations (10%). Sequence changes, which included missense, frameshift and complex mutations, were detected in both familial and isolated cases, among patients with both long- and short-segment HSCR and in three kindreds with other phenotypes (maternal deafness, talipes and malrotation of the gut, respectively). Two mutations (C609Y and C620R) we identified have previously been associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A), medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and, on rare occasions, HSCR. Thus, while HSCR family members may be at risk for developing neuroendocrine tumors, it follows that identical mutations in RET may be able to participate in the pathogenesis of distinct phenotypes. Our data suggest that: (i) the overall frequency of RET mutations in HSCR patients is low and therefore, other genetic and/or environmental determinants contribute to the majority of HSCR susceptibility, and (ii) at present, there is no obvious relationship between RET genotype and HSCR phenotype.",

Hereditary MTC is divided into three clinical subtypes: multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A is characterized by MTC, pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism. MEN 2B is characterized by aggressive MTC, pheochromocytoma, marfanoid habitus and the presence of distinctive mucosal neuromas on the tongue, lips and subconjunctival areas as well as ganglioneuromatosis of the gastrointestinal tract. The third clinical subtype of inherited MTC, familial MTC, is defined as the presence of MTC in families without evidence of adrenal or parathyroid gland involvement. Hereditary MTC is caused by autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. The first RET germline mutations were identified in 1993 in patients with MEN 2A and FMTC. Initially a codon 634 (exon 11) mutation was found in approximately 85% of patients with MEN 2A, and germline mutations in FMTC kindreds were more equally distributed throughout the RET proto-onocogene. In about 5% of families in these earlier series, mutations did not reside in exons 10 and 11. We now report a change in the spectrum of mutations detected in the RET proto-oncogene in patients with hereditary MTC from the 'classical' mutation at codon 634 in exon 11 (level 2) to more cases with mutations in the exons 13-15 (level 1) and less aggressive disease.

Among genetic modifiers affecting RET-driven MTC, a role has been hypothesized for RET-G691S non-synonymous polymorphism, though the issue remains controversial. Aim of this study was to define the in vitro contribution of RET-G691S to the oncogenic potential of the RET-S891A, previously shown to harbour low transforming activity.;The RET-S891A and RET-G691S/S891A mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis, transiently transfected in HEK293T cells and stably expressed in NIH3T3 cells. Their oncogenic potential was defined by assessing the migration ability by wound healing assay and the anchorage-independent growth by soft agar assay in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing either the single or the double mutants. Two RET-S891A families were characterised for the presence of RET-G691S.;The functional studies demonstrated that RET-G691S/S891A double mutant displays a higher oncogenic potential than RET-S891A single mutant, assessed by focus formation and migration ability. Moreover, among the 25 RET-S891A carriers, a trend towards an earlier age of diagnosis was found in the MTC patients harboring RET-S891A in association with RET-G691S.;We demonstrate that the RET-G691S non-synonymous polymorphism enhances in vitro the oncogenic activity of RET-S891A.

These rearrangements generate chimeric RET/PTC oncogenes. In the germline, point mutations of RET are responsible for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2A and 2B) and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). Both MEN 2 mutations and PTC gene rearrangements potentiate the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of RET and, ultimately, activate the RET downstream targets.

        "Doc_abstract":"Since medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) was first recognized as a distinct tumor in 1959, it became clear that MTC is more difficult to cure than papillary thyroid cancer and has higher rates of recurrence and mortality. MTC represents 5-8% of thyroid cancers. It derives from parafollicular cells of the ultimobranchial body derived from the neural crest. MTC secretes calcitonin and other hormonal peptides and is considered part of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxilation system. MTC may occur either as a hereditary or nonhereditary entity. Hereditary MTC can occur either alone as the familial MTC or as the thyroid manifestation of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes (MEN 2A MEN 2B). Activating point mutations of the RET proto-oncogene have demonstrated to be causative of the familial form of medullary thyroid cancer, both isolated familial MTC and associated with MEN 2A and 2B. In the last 10 years, major improvements and new technologies have been proposed and applied in thyroid surgery; among these are molecular diagnosis with genetic screening and mini-invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy. The history of thyroid surgery starts with Billroth, Kocher and Halsted, who developed the technique for thyroidectomy between 1873 and 1910. Prophylactic surgery for patients carrying a positive RET proto-oncogene has proven to be highly effective in curing those likely to experience the development of MTC. Video-assisted procedures with central compartment dissection have proved feasible for patients carrying a positive RET proto-oncogene. This paper reviews relevant medical literature published in the English language on surgery of MTC in well-controlled trials. We discuss the particular ethical and legal issues that thyroid prophylactic surgery raises. Searches were last updated in February 2007.",

To identify additional low-penetrance genes, we have done a two-stage case-control study in two European populations using high-throughput genotyping. We selected 417 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) belonging to 69 genes either related to RET signaling pathway/functions or involved in key processes for cancer development. TagSNPs and functional variants were included where possible. These SNPs were initially studied in the largest known series of sMTC cases (n = 266) and controls (n = 422), all of Spanish origin. In stage II, an independent British series of 155 sMTC patients and 531 controls was included to validate the previous results. Associations were assessed by an exhaustive analysis of individual SNPs but also considering gene- and linkage disequilibrium-based haplotypes. This strategy allowed us to identify seven low-penetrance genes, six of them (STAT1, AURKA, BCL2, CDKN2B, CDK6, and COMT) consistently associated with sMTC risk in the two case-control series and a seventh (HRAS) with individual SNPs and haplotypes associated with sMTC in the Spanish data set. The potential role of CDKN2B was confirmed by a functional assay showing a role of a SNP (rs7044859) in the promoter region in altering the binding of the transcription factor HNF1.

On the other hand, the presence of the mutation does not seem to influence the biological behavior of the tumor or its response to conventional treatment modalities. In the setting of medullary thyroid cancer, germline RET point-mutations are implicated in the pathogenesis of virtually all hereditary forms and somatic point-mutations in nearly half of the sporadic forms. The clinical impact of this finding is that family members at-risk of hereditary MTC may be screened by genetic analysis, to distinguish those carrying or not-carrying the mutation. The last can be reassured on their status and relieved from further follow-up. Those with the mutation may be treated at a pre-clinical stage of the disease or even before the disease is started.

We have constructed a 1.5-megabase contig consisting of six genomic yeast artificial chromosome clones which include these loci and define their physical order. A critical crossover event has been identified within the map interval; this event places the MEN2A locus centromeric to D10S102 and defines the orientation of the physical map on the chromosome. The orientation of the contig and order of the markers are centromere-RET-D10S94-D10S102-telomere. In addition, a microsatellite repeat polymorphism with a heterozygosity of 71% at the RET locus and a restriction fragment length polymorphism with a heterozygosity of 42% detected by a lambda clone from the D10S94 locus have been developed for high-resolution genetic linkage mapping and predictive diagnostic testing.

Targeting RET, therefore, might be useful in tailoring surveillance of MTC patients. Here we showed that theaflavins, the bioactive components of black tea, successfully induced apoptosis in human MTC cell line, TT, by inversely modulating two molecular pathways: (i) stalling PI3K/Akt/Bad pathway that resulted in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) loss, cytochrome-c release and activation of the executioner caspases-9 and -3, and (ii) upholding p38MAPK/caspase-8/caspase-3 pathway via inhibition of Ras/Raf/ERK. Over-expression of either constitutively active myristoylated-Akt-cDNA (Myr-Akt-cDNA) or dominant-negative-caspase-8-cDNA (Dn-caspase-8-cDNA) partially blocked theaflavin-induced apoptosis, while co-transfection of Myr-Akt-cDNA and Dn-caspase-8-cDNA completely eradicated the effect of theaflavins thereby negating the possibility of existence of other pathways. A search for the upstream signaling revealed that theaflavin-induced disruption of lipid raft caused interference in anchorage of RET in lipid raft that in turn stalled phosphorylation of Ras and PI3Kinase. In such anti-survival cellular micro-environment, pro-apoptotic signals were triggered to culminate into programmed death of MTC cell. These findings not only unveil a hitherto unexplained mechanism underlying theaflavin-induced MTC death, but also validate RET as a promising and potential target for MTC therapy.",

In these cases, MTC is part of an inherited cancer syndrome that has three distinct forms: MEN2A, MEN2B and familial MTC (FMTC). MEN2A is the most frequent syndrome, followed by FMTC and MEN2B. In 95% of MEN2A families and 85% of FMTC families, the germ-line missense mutations underlying the disease affect one of the five cysteine codons of the extracellular domain of the RET proto-oncogene. The mutated codons are 609, 611, 618 and 620 in exon 10, and 634 in exon 11. The most frequent mutations (80% in MEN2A, and 50% in FMTC) occur in codon 634. In our laboratory, the mutations of the codon 634 was detected by two independent methods: DNA sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism with polymerase chain reaction (PCR-RFLP). We have so far examined 105 persons at risk and found 19 positive cases. A positive genetic diagnosis allows preventive thyroidectomy, with a resultant cause-specific survival similar to that for the general population. In the event of a negative result, the family members of the affected proband are relieved of the physical and emotional consequences of the disease and the follow-up procedures.

The expression of MKP-2 was not only induced by RET-MEN2A or RET-MEN2B mutant proteins but also by the activation of endogenous RET by its ligand, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). MKP-2 expression was also evident in the MKK-f cell line, which was established from a mammary tumor developed in a RET-MEN2A transgenic mouse. Inhibition of MKP-2 attenuated the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of MKK-f cells, which was mediated by the suppression of cyclin B1 expression. Furthermore, we found that MKP-2 is highly expressed in medullary thyroid carcinomas derived from MEN2A patients. These findings suggest that the increased expression of MKP-2 may play a crucial role in oncogenic signaling downstream of mutant RET, leading to deregulation of cell cycle.",

Further, prophylactic total thyroidectomy is indicated in all cases harboring activating gametic RET mutations.

        "Doc_abstract":"During the last two decades, there has been a marked expansion of our knowledge of both the basic and clinical aspects of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2). There are two clinically distinct types of MEN2 syndrome, termed MEN2A and MEN2B. Within MEN2A, there are four variants: (i) classical MEN2A, represented by the uniform presence of MTC and the less frequent occurrence of pheochromocytoma, or primary hyperparathyroidism, or both; (ii) MEN2A with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis; (iii) MEN2A with Hirschsprung's disease; and (iv) familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), i.e., families or individuals with only MTC. MEN2B is associated with MTC, pheochromocytoma, and mucosal neuromas. Hereditary MTC is caused by autosomal dominant gain of function mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. Specific RET mutations may suggest a predilection toward a particular phenotype and clinical course with a strong genotype-phenotype correlation. Based upon these genotype-phenotype correlations, RET mutations are now stratified into three risk levels, i.e., highest, high, and moderate risk, based on the penetrance and aggressiveness of the MTC. Children in the highest risk category should undergo thyroidectomy in their first year of life, and perhaps even in their first months of life. Children in the high-risk category should have ultrasound of the neck and calcitonin (CTN) measurement performed prior to thyroidectomy. Thyroidectomy should typically be performed at the age of 5 or earlier, depending on the presence of elevated serum CTN levels. However, heterogeneity in disease expression and progression within these groups varies considerably. To personalize disease management, the decision regarding the age of prophylactic thyroidectomy is no longer based upon genotype alone but is currently driven by additional clinical data, the most important being serum CTN levels; specifically, the decision to perform thyroidectomy should err on the safe side if the CTN level is elevated but below 30 pg/ml, especially in the moderate risk group. Personalized management also includes decisions about the best age to begin biochemical screening for pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism. ",

This study assessed the prevalence of multifocality in sMTC via a large international multi-institutional retrospective review to quantify this prevalence, including the impact of geography, to assess more accurately the risks associated with alternative surgical approaches.;A retrospective chart review of sMTC patients from 11 institutions over 29 years (1983-2011) was undertaken. Data regarding focality, extent of disease, RET germline analysis plus family and clinical history for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), and demographic data were collected and analyzed.;Patients from four continents and seven countries were included in the sample. Data for 313 patients with documented sMTC were collected. Of these, 81.2% were confirmed with negative RET germline testing, while the remaining 18.8% demonstrated a negative family history and no manifestations of MEN2 syndromes other than MTC. Bilateral disease was identified in 17/306 (5.6%) patients, while multifocal disease was noted in 50/312 (16.0%) sMTC patients. When only accounting for germline negative patients, these rates were not significantly different (5.6% and 17%, respectively). Among them, when disease was unifocal in the ipsilateral lobe and isthmus, bilateral disease was present in 6/212 (2.8%) cases. When disease was multifocal in the ipsilateral lobe or isthmus, then bilateral disease was present in 8/37 (21.6%) cases (p < 0.001). No geographic differences in focality were identified.;The 5.6% prevalence of bilateral foci in sMTC suggests that total thyroidectomy should remain the standard of care for initial surgery, as less complete thyroid surgery may fail to address fully the primary site of disease. Whether ipsilateral tumor focality should be an independent factor determining the need for completion thyroidectomy when sMTC is diagnosed after hemithyroidectomy remains to be determined.",

In these cancers, RET activates the ERK/MAPK, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the JAK/STAT3 pathways. Here, we tested the efficacy of a JAK1/2- inhibitor, AZD1480, in the in vitro and in vivo growth of thyroid cancer cell lines expressing oncogenic RET. Thyroid cancer cell lines harboring RET/PTC1 (TPC-1), RET M918T (MZ-CRC1) and RET C634W (TT) alterations, as well as TPC-1 xenografts, were treated with JAK inhibitor, AZD1480. This inhibitor led to growth inhibition and/or apoptosis of the thyroid cancer cell lines in vitro, as well as to tumor regression of TPC-1 xenografts, where it efficiently blocked STAT3 activation in tumor and stromal cells. This inhibition was associated with decreased proliferation, decreased blood vessel density, coupled with increased necrosis. However, AZD1480 repressed the growth of STAT3- deficient TPC-1 cells in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that its effects in this cell line were independent of STAT3 in the tumor cells. In all cell lines, the JAK inhibitor reduced phospho-Y1062 RET levels, and mTOR effector phospho-S6, while JAK1/2 downregulation by siRNA did not affect cell growth nor RET and S6 activation. In conclusion, AZD1480 effectively blocks proliferation and tumor growth of activated RET- thyroid cancer cell lines, likely through direct RET inhibition in cancer cells as well as by modulation of the microenvironment (e.g. via JAK/phospho-STAT3 inhibition in endothelial cells). Thus, AZD1480 should be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of RET- activated thyroid cancers.",

The inducible genes include cyclin D1, cathepsins B and L, and cofilin genes that are known to be involved in cell growth, tumor progression, and invasion.

In the majority of patients with MEN 2A/FMTC missense mutations at exon 10 or exon 11 are identifiable. Cysteine to arginine exchange at codon 634 is the mutation most frequently found. In MEN 2B approximately 95% of patients present with a mutation at codon 918 (exon 16). Additionally, less frequent mutations in other codons have been found in both syndromes. The DNA-based genotype analysis enables the identification of gene carriers at risk of developing MTC and offer them prophylactic thyroidectomy prior to development of any thyroid pathologies. Prophylactic surgery is generally recommended for MEN 2A/FMTC gene carriers at the age of 4-6 years. Due to the aggressiveness of the MEN 2B syndrome gene carriers should be operated by the age of 1 year. Presumably some less virulent mutations allow postponement of the prophylactic treatment to the second to fourth decade of life.;Compared to standard presymptomatic biochemical screening, genetic testing and consecutive prophylactic treatment contribute to better outcome of individuals at risk for MTC.",

RET encodes a receptor with tyrosine kinase activity that targets several intracellular signaling cascades, such as RAS-RAF-ERK1/2, PIK3-AKT, and STAT transcription factors. The objective of this study was to assess the function of three germ line RET variants Arg886Trp, Ser649Leu, and Glu511Lys of undetermined pathogenic significance, which were found in three kindreds of isolated AS-MTC. For this purpose, we employed vectors expressing each of the RET variants and measured the number of NIH3T3 transformation foci and soft agar colonies, the degree of activation of known RET intracellular signaling targets (ERK1/2, STAT1, STAT3, and TCF4), and the extent of ERK1/2 inhibition on sorafenib treatment. We found that RET variants Arg886Trp and Glu511Lys have shown increased in vitro transforming potential in a glial-derived neurotrophic factor-dependent manner. In contrast, the Ser649Leu variant did not significantly increased the number of foci and agar colonies relative to wild-type RET (RET-WT). The variants Glu511Lys and Arg886Trp showed 10- and 12.5-fold ERK1/2 activation respectively, that was significantly higher than that observed for RET-WT (fivefold). Increased levels of STAT1 and TCF4 activation were only observed for RET Arg886Trp (2.5- and 3-fold versus 1.2- and 2-fold in RET-WT respectively). The three RET variants analyzed here were sensitive to treatment with sorafenib. In conclusion, our results allow to classify previously uncharacterized RET genotypes, which may be of use to define follow-up and therapeutic regimens.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the contribution of mTOR activity to RET-induced signaling and cell growth and to establish whether growth suppression is enhanced by co-targeting RET and mTOR kinase activities. Treatment of the RET mutant cell lines TT, TPC-1, and MZ-CRC-1 with AST487, a RET kinase inhibitor, suppressed growth and showed profound and sustained inhibition of mTOR signaling, which was recapitulated by siRNA-mediated RET knockdown. Inhibition of mTOR with INK128, a dual mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase inhibitor, also resulted in marked growth suppression to levels similar to those seen with RET blockade. Moreover, combined treatment with AST487 and INK128 at low concentrations suppressed growth and induced apoptosis.

        "Doc_abstract":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia Type 2 (MEN 2) is an inherited cancer syndrome characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). The disease has three subtypes, which are distinguished by the presence of additional phenotypes. In particular, pheochromocytoma occurs in approximately 50% of patients with the MEN 2A or MEN 2B subtypes, but is not found in patients with the milder disease subtype, familial MTC (FMTC). All subtypes of MEN 2 are caused by activating mutations of the RET (REarranged in Transfection) proto-oncogene. RET encodes a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, required for development of neuroendocrine cell types and the kidneys. All MEN 2 subtypes are associated with single amino acid substitution mutations that are found in either the extracellular domain or in the kinase domain of RET. There are strong genotype-phenotype correlations in MEN 2 between patient phenotype and the specific residue that is mutated. MEN 2A is primarily associated with substitutions at five extracellular cysteine residues, while 95% of MEN 2B is associated with a single methionine to threonine mutation in the kinase domain (M918T). In FMTC, RET mutations are more broadly distributed, with both extracellular cysteines and intracellular sites implicated. In all cases, MEN 2-RET mutations result in constitutive activation of the receptor, although the mechanism and relative functional effects of the mutations vary. Recent advances in functional characterization and development of molecular models of RET and of various MEN 2-RET mutants are helping us understand tissue-specific differences in oncogenic potential conferred by the different RET mutations. Here, we discuss and compare several well-characterized mutations of the extracellular and kinase domains, which have quite varied functional implications.",

Hirschsprung disease usually occurs as a sporadic disease, although it may be associated with several inherited conditions, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. The rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene is the major susceptibility gene for Hirschsprung disease, and germline mutations in RET have been reported in up to 50% of the inherited forms of Hirschsprung disease and in 15-20% of sporadic cases of Hirschsprung disease. The prevalence of Hirschsprung disease in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 cases was recently determined to be 7.5% and the cooccurrence of Hirschsprung disease and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 has been reported in at least 22 families so far. It was initially thought that Hirschsprung disease could be due to disturbances in apoptosis or due to a tendency of the mutated RET receptor to be retained in the Golgi apparatus. Presently, there is strong evidence favoring the hypothesis that specific inactivating haplotypes play a key role in the fetal development of congenital megacolon/Hirschsprung disease. In the present study, we report the genetic findings in a novel family with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2: a specific RET haplotype was documented in patients with Hirschsprung disease associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma, but it was absent in patients with only medullary thyroid carcinoma.

Dok1 bound more strongly to RET with a multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B mutation than RET with a MEN2A mutation and was highly phosphorylated in the cells expressing the former mutant protein. Analysis by site-directed mutagenesis revealed that tyrosine 361 in mouse Dok1 represents a binding site for the Nck adaptor protein and tyrosines 295, 314, 361, 376, 397, and 408 for the Ras-GTPase-activating protein. We replaced tyrosine 361 or these six tyrosines with phenylalanine (designated Y361F or 6F) in Dok1 and introduced the mutant Dok1 genes into the cells expressing the wild-type RET or RET-MEN2B protein. Overexpression of Dok1 or Dok1-Y361F, but not Dok1-6F, suppressed the Ras/Erk activation induced by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor or RET-MEN2B, implying that this inhibitory effect requires the Ras-GTPase-activating protein binding to Dok1. In contrast, overexpression of Dok1, but not Dok1-Y361F or Dok1-6F, enhanced the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun activation. This suggested that the association of Nck to tyrosine 361 in Dok1 is necessary for the JNK and c-Jun activation by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor or RET-MEN2B. Because a high level of the JNK phosphorylation was observed in the cells expressing RET-MEN2B, its strong activation via Nck binding to Dok1 may be responsible for aggressive properties of medullary thyroid carcinoma developed in MEN 2B.",

A low-penetrance founder locus, in linkage disequilibrium with a RET ancestral haplotype comprising specific alleles at three intron (IVS) 1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (haplotype 0) and SNP A45A, predisposes to the majority of isolated HSCR. A different low-penetrance locus, in linkage disequilibrium with IVS 1 haplotype 2 and SNP S836S, was associated with a subset of sporadic MTC. We, therefore, sought to determine whether RET might also be a low-penetrance gene for apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma. We analyzed 104 pheochromocytoma cases without germline mutations in RET, VHL, SDHD, and SDHB for their status at A45, S836, three IVS 1 SNPs, and a novel upstream insertion/deletion variant. Pheochromocytoma cases were not associated with either A45A or S836S, but we found that cases were associated with haplotype 0 (P = 0.032). However, unlike HSCR, this pheochromocytoma-associated haplotype 0 was not associated with A45A. Taken together with the strengthening of association with the addition of the 5' insertion/deletion variant data (P = 0.016), our observations suggest the presence of a low-penetrance pheochromocytoma susceptibility locus in a region upstream of the putative loci for HSCR and apparently sporadic MTC.",

HSCR demonstrates a complex pattern of inheritance, with the RET proto-oncogene acting as a major gene and with several additional susceptibility loci related to the Ret-signaling pathway or to other developmental programs of neural crest cells. To test how the HSCR phenotype may be affected by the presence of genetic variants, we investigated the role of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 2508C-->T (S836S), in exon 14 of the RET gene, characterized by low frequency among patients with HSCR and overrepresentation in individuals affected by sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma. Typing of several different markers across the RET gene demonstrated that a whole conserved haplotype displayed anomalous distribution and nonrandom segregation in families with HSCR. We provide genetic evidence about a protective role of this low-penetrant haplotype in the pathogenesis of HSCR and demonstrate a possible functional effect linked to RET messenger RNA expression.",

RET is expressed during embryogenesis in a temporally and spatially regulated manner, and plays an important role in the normal development of a variety of cell lineages, particularly in the establishment of the enteric nervous system. RET mutations observed in patients with HD are scattered along the gene without any hot spots, and possess a loss-of-function effect. RET mutations are detected with a higher incidence among familial cases (50%) than sporadic cases (15%-20%), and are more closely associated with long-segment HD than short-segment disease. In contrast to HD mutations, missense mutations observed in MEN 2 syndromes occur at specific codons, and gene rearrangements are characteristic in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Both missense mutations and gene rearrangements act in a dominant fashion, and cause constitutive phosphorylation on the tyrosine of RET and highly enhance RET kinase activity, leading to transforming or oncogenic activity.",

Whether this approach is justified, and, if so, when and to which extent surgery should be performed remained to be clarified. A questionnaire was sent to all surgical departments in Germany and Austria. All of the patients who fulfilled the following criteria were enrolled: (1) preoperatively proved RET mutation; (2) age </= 20 years, (3) clinically asymptomatic thyroid C cell disease; and (4) TNM classification pT0-1/pNX/pN0-1/M0. Seventy-five patients were identified, and fifteen mutations were detected in six codons. Two adolescents had unilateral pheochromocytomas as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia II (MEN-II) syndrome. No hyperparathyroidism was noted. All patients underwent total thyroidectomy, and 57 patients went on to have lymph node dissection. Parathyroid glands were removed in 34 patients and autografted in 11. Histopathology revealed MTC in 46 patients (61%, youngest 4 years); C cell hyperplasia (CCH) only was detected in the other 29 patients. Three patients had lymph node metastases (LNMs) the youngest being age 14 years. Calcitonin levels were not useful for differentiating between CCH and MTC, but in all patients with LNMs at least the stimulated calcitonin levels were assayed. After surgery, five patients (6.7%) sustained permanent hypoparathyroidism, and one patient (1.3%) had a permanent unilateral recurrent nerve palsy. All but three patients (96%) were biochemically cured. In conclusion, prophylactic total thyroidectomy can be performed safely in experienced centers. We recommend prophylactic total thyroidectomy at age 6. Cervicocentral lymph node dissection should be included when calcitonin levels are elevated or if patients are older than 10 years. Bilateral lymph node dissection should be performed if LNMs are suspected or when patients with elevated calcitonin are older than 15 years.",

By international efforts, we ascertained all available carriers of the RET C634W mutation. Age at diagnosis, penetrance, and clinical complications were analyzed for medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism (HPT), as well as overall survival. Our series comprises 92 carriers from 20 unrelated families worldwide. Sixty-eight subjects had MTC diagnosed at age 3-72 years (mean 29).

Eighteen subjects died; of the 16 with known causes of death, 8 died of pheochromocytoma and 4 of MTC. Penetrance for MTC is 52% by age 30 and 83% by age 50, for pheochromocytoma penetrance is 20% by age 30 and 67% by age 50, and for HPT penetrance is 3% by age 30 and 21% by age 50.

The situation in MEN2 is more straightforward.

Further, when we validated our microarray data by quantitative real time PCR, we did not detect major differences in gene expression associated with these mutants when differences in receptor activity levels were considered. We did, however, detect differences in gene expression induced by two RET COOH-terminal isoforms, RET9 and RET51, irrespective of the RET form present (wildtype, 2ARET, or 2BRET).

        "Doc_abstract":"All patients with a thyroid nodule should have their plasma CT measured. Stimulated CT is generally better than basal, but in the lower ranges false negatives and false positives still occur. In families with hereditary MTC, RET gene mutation analysis has superseded measurement of plasma CT in the detection of asymptomatic disease gene carriers. All individuals with apparently sporadic MTC, but in whom there is some suspicion of familial disease, should also have RET genetic analysis. A negative DNA result practically excludes the possibility of hereditary MTC in families where an index case has been investigated and obviates the need for further biochemical evaluation. Disease gene carriers may be divided into three distinct risk groups depending on the specific RET gene mutation in the family. The age at which presymptomatic surgery has to be performed depends on the risk group to which the patient belongs. Compared with the results of DNA analysis, the results of CT stimulation tests have become less important in the assessment of timing of surgery. During follow-up of patients who underwent surgery, measurement of plasma basal CT is still useful. The high sensitivity of measuring stimulated CT levels does not outweigh the burden of life-long periodic stimulation tests and the limited clinical consequences of slightly elevated levels. Stimulation tests are inevitable for persons at risk who prefer not to have genetic testing.",

A cell line established from the tumor and propagated in culture sustained the expression of RET and calcitonin, as did the original pheochromocytoma. Because the patient presented with medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma without parathyroid gland involvement, we speculate that this clinical picture could be correlated with the two RET mutations and to the unusual calcitonin production.

Molecular DNA screening of samples was performed by non-radioactive single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and heteroduplex gel electrophoresis method followed by mutation analysis of PCR products by direct cycle sequencing using an automated DNA sequencer. We identified 12 MEN 2A/FMSC and 6 MEN 2B families with 29 gene carriers. Ten different types of mutations were identified in the MEN 2A/FMTC families (620 Cys-->Arg, 618 Cys-->Ser, Gly, 611 Cys-->Tyr; 634 Cys-->Arg, Tyr, Trp, Phe, Ser, Gly) and all 6 MEN 2B families had a 918 Met-->Thr point mutation. Our results indicate that PCR-based DNA testing for RET point mutations is a rapid, accurate and reproducible method of identifying MEN 2 gene carriers using blood or tissue DNA. Early detection of gene carriers allows preventive thyroidectomy without neck dissection or parathyroid transplantation, and non-gene carriers can be released from biochemical testing. Furthermore, it is shown that the distribution and localization of RET mutations in MEN 2 families from Switzerland concur with combined results of larger series and that a \"founder effect\" of MEN 2 can be excluded for this country.",

Thus, in PC12 cells, RET-MEN2A associates with the PI3K regulatory subunit p85 and promotes activation of Akt (also referred to as protein kinase B) in a PI3K-dependent fashion; in addition, RET-MEN2A promotes MAPK activation. PI3K recruitment and Akt activation as well as MAPK activation depend on RET-MEN2A tyrosine residue 1062.

The mechanisms by which different Ret isoforms (Ret-2A and Ret-2B) cause distinct neoplastic diseases remain largely unknown. On the other hand, forced expression of these mutated versions of Ret induces the rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12, to differentiate. Here we used an inducible vector encoding a dominant-negative Ras (Ras p21(N17)) to investigate the contributions of the Ras pathway to the phenotype induced in PC12 cells by the expression of either Ret-2A or Ret-2B mutants. We show that the Ret-induced molecular and morphological changes are both mediated by Ras-dependent pathways. However, even though inhibition of Ras activity was sufficient to revert Ret-induced differentiation, the kinetics of morphological reversion of the Ret-2B- was more rapid than the Ret-2A-transfected cells. Further, we show that in Ret-transfected cells the suc1-associated neurotrophic factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation target, SNT, is chronically phosphorylated in tyrosine residues, and associates with the Sos substrate. These results indicate the activation of the Ras cascade as an essential pathway triggered by the chronic active Ret mutants in PC12 cells.

Germline mutations in RET are responsible for this autosomal dominant syndrome. Familial MTC is a variant of MEN 2A and can be caused by RET mutations in codon 791. Deaths from gene carriers with mutations in these codons have not yet been reported. In general, gene carriers with these RET mutations have late-onset MTC. Because only a few kindreds with this specific mutation have been identified and no long-term follow-up data are available, management of these patients can be a challenge.

Its prognosis is dependent on the appearance and spread of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Relatives at risk can be identified before clinical or biochemical signs of the disease become evident.;Twenty-one families with MEN 2 (16 families with MEN 2A and 5 families with MEN 2B) were studied. Peripheral blood DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. DNA sequence or restriction enzyme analysis was performed to detect mutations of RET proto-oncogene exons 10, 11, and 16. Molecular analysis was carried out in all index patients as well as in 98 relatives of MEN 2A patients (60 juveniles, ages 6 months to 21 years, and 38 adults, ages 22 to 81 years) and in 13 relatives (6 juveniles ages 10 to 21 years, and 7 adults ages 41 to 66 years) from MEN 2B families.;Molecular studies showed a mutation at codon 634, exon 11 in all MEN 2A patients. All MEN 2B patients showed an ATG to ACG (Met918Thr) mutation. In MEN 2A families, 42 out of 98 relatives were affected. Total thyroidectomy was performed in 18 juvenile carriers ages 17 months to 21 years. Histopathologic studies of the glands revealed parafollicular cell (C-cell) hyperplasia in all of these carriers, medullary thyroid carcinoma in 15 carriers, and only one carrier with lymph node metastases.;The consistent finding of C-cell disease in all the juvenile carriers who underwent preventive thyroidectomy emphasizes the relevance of early screening in children at risk of developing MTC. The presence of MTC in the specimen of prophylactic thyroidectomy from a 17 month old girl highlights the importance of thyroidectomy as soon as the molecular diagnosis is confirmed.",

RET protein comprises an extracellular portion with four cadherine-like domains and a cysteine- rich region important for intermolecular interactions; a hydrophobic transmembrane domain; an intracellular part comprising the juxtamembrane domain with regulatory function and the catalytic domain that phosphorylates the tyrosine residues of substrates. RET is involved in the development of enteric nervous system and renal organogenesis during embryonic life. Mutations of RET are associated to a subset of colorectal cancer and are commonly found in hereditary and sporadic thyroid cancer. Activating point mutations in the cystein-rich or the kinase domain of RET cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), a group of familial cancer syndromes characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, parathyroid hyperplasia and ganglioneuromatosis of the gastroenteric mucosa. Rearranged forms of RET (termed RET/PTC) are detected in the majority of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC). At present, the therapeutic treatment available for these pathologies is the total or partial surgical removal of thyroid, associated with radio-iodine therapy or chemotherapy: despite widespread use of multimodality treatment, survival rates have not improved much in the past few decades, which suggests that new treatment options should be explored. Several small-molecule inhibitors of RET kinase activity have been described in the last decade, some of which are currently undergoing clinical evaluation. Here, I review the large preclinical effort to the development of specific RET inhibitors, including medicinal chemistry analyses that may help refine potency and selectivity of future RET-targeted inhibitors.",

No animal model mimicking the co-existence of the MEN 2 pathology and HSCR is available, and the association of these activating mutations with a developmental defect still represents an unresolved problem. The aim of this work was to investigate the significance of the RET(C620R) substitution in the pathogenesis of both gain- and loss-of-function RET-associated diseases. We report the generation of a line of mice carrying the C620R mutation in the Ret gene. Although Ret(C620R) homozygotes display severe defects in kidney organogenesis and enteric nervous system development leading to perinatal lethality. Ret(C620R) heterozygotes recapitulate features characteristic of HSCR including hypoganglionosis of the gastrointestinal tract. Surprisingly, heterozygotes do not show any defects in the thyroid that might be attributable to a gain-of-function mutation. The Ret(C620R) allele is responsible for HSCR and affects the development of kidneys and the enteric nervous system (ENS).

Previously, using a human epidermal growth factor receptor - Ret chimaeric receptor (HERRet) stably transfected into fibroblasts, it was shown that Ret activation induces the activation of p21ras, but, surprisingly, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) was not observed (Santoro et al. (1994) Mol. Cell. Biol., 14, 663). In this report we describe early signaling events induced by the activated HERRet fusion receptor in a cell line derived from neuroectodermal tissue, SK-N-MC. In these cells, activated HERRet induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, complex formation of Shc with Grb2 and Sos and activation of p21ras. Importantly, also ERK2 is activated. This activation was strong and sustained for at least 2 h. Activation was abolished by the dominant negative p21rasasn17 mutant, showing that activation of ERK2 is mediated by p21ras. These results suggest that Ret can induce ERK2 activation in a p21ras dependent manner in cells derived from tissue where Ret is endogenously expressed.",

All patients had previously attended genetic counselling with detection of germline Ret-mutations, were informed on their own genetic risk, had good short-term prognosis and performance status and did not receive recent cancer treatment.

Although psychometric scores appeared similar in these subgroups, quality of life scores were lower in Ret-mutation carriers.

Expression of Gab1 PI3K-m in SK-N-MC human primitive neuroectodermal tumor cells expressing wild-type RET markedly impaired Akt phosphorylation, Rac1 activation, and lamellipodia formation that were induced by GDNF whereas expression of Gab1 SHP2-m partially impaired Erk activation. Furthermore, expression of Gab1 PI3K-m, but not Gab1 SHP2-m, in TT human medullary thyroid carcinoma cells expressing RET with a multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A mutation enhanced cytochrome c release, and apoptosis induced by etoposide, suggesting that PI3K is involved in survival of TT cells via a mitochondrial pathway.

The present article describes clinical evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of MTC.;The aim of the consensus described herein, which was elaborated by Brazilian experts and sponsored by the Thyroid Department of the Brazilian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism, was to discuss the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of individuals with MTC in accordance with the latest evidence reported in the literature.;After clinical questions were elaborated, the available literature was initially surveyed for evidence in the MedLine-PubMed database, followed by the Embase and Scientific Electronic Library Online/Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature (SciELO/Lilacs) databases. The strength of evidence was assessed according to the Oxford classification of evidence levels, which is based on study design, and the best evidence available for each question was selected.;Eleven questions corresponded to MTC diagnosis, 8 corresponded to its surgical treatment, and 13 corresponded to follow-up, for a total of 32 recommendations. The present article discusses the clinical and molecular diagnosis, initial surgical treatment, and postoperative management of MTC, as well as the therapeutic options for metastatic disease.;MTC should be suspected in individuals who present with thyroid nodules and family histories of MTC, associations with pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism, and/or typical phenotypic characteristics such as ganglioneuromatosis and Marfanoid habitus. Fine-needle nodule aspiration, serum calcitonin measurements, and anatomical-pathological examinations are useful for diagnostic confirmation. Surgery represents the only curative therapeutic strategy. The therapeutic options for metastatic disease remain limited and are restricted to disease control. Judicious postoperative assessments that focus on the identification of residual or recurrent disease are of paramount importance when defining the follow-up and later therapeutic management strategies.",

Genetic analysis detected C618R RET mutation in the proband and her 3 sons, and no other mutations were found in RET as well as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF).

        "Doc_abstract":"Activation of the RET proto-oncogene, located on the long arms of chromosome 10, contributes to the development of thyroid cancers in two different ways. First, somatic rearrangements of RET with variable activation genes are frequently found in papillary thyroid carcinomas. Second, germ-line point mutations are responsible for the development of medullary thyroid carcinomas and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2). There are several conflicting reports on the influences of RET expression and RET/PTC rearrangements on the clinical outcome of thyroid cancers. Therefore, the wild-type RET gene expression and RET/PTC-1, RET/PTC-2, RET/PTC-3 rearrangements were examined in thyroid carcinomas and other thyroid diseases.;Thirty-six papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), 8 follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs), 4 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC), 7 follicular adenomas (FAs), 23 hyperplasias, 6 normal thyroid tissues, and 39 normal portions from each tumor were included in this study. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analyses were used to identify the RET gene and RET/PTC rearrangements.;From the RT-PCR analysis, 68.9% of the PTCs, a single case of FTC, and 22.2% of the hyperplasias expressed the RET gene. No RET gene expression was observed in ATCs, FAs, or normal thyroid tissues. One RET/PTC-1 and one RET/PTC-2 rearrangement were detected in the PTCs. No RET/PTC-3 rearrangement was detected in any specimen. The immunohistochemical results revealed that 66.7% of PTCs, 28.6% of FAs, and 18.2% of hyperplastic thyroid tissue specimens showed high levels of RET protein expression. Neither the normal thyroid tissues nor the FTCs and ATC, showed high levels of RET protein expression. The two methods are agreed in PTC and hyperplastic nodules, but not in FA and FTC.;PTCs among Koreans rarely showed RET/PTC rearrangements, but commonly showed increased RET gene expression. Compared to earlier reports indicating that the expression of the RET gene was limited to PTCs, the RET gene was also expressed in hyperplasias in this study.",

Although it is well accepted that the constitutive active tyrosine kinase of Ret oncogenes ultimately leads to malignant transformation, it is not clear whether a decrease in the autophosphorylation of oncogenic Ret forms can affect the mitogenic and transforming activities of Ret. Potential modulators of the tyrosine kinase activity of Ret could be tyrosine phosphatases that are expressed in human thyroid tissue. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2 on the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and oncogenic potency of Ret with a 9-bp duplication in the cysteine-rich domain (codons 634-636), which was described in a patient with MEN type 2A recently. SHP1 and SHP2 were stably overexpressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts together with Ret-9bp. Coexpression of SHP1 with Ret-9bp reduced the autophosphorylation of Ret-9bp by 19 +/- 7% (P = 0.01, n = 4), whereas no effect was seen with SHP2. Furthermore, Ret-9bp could be coimmunoprecipitated with SHP1 but not with SHP2 antibodies. Suppression of the Ret-9bp tyrosine kinase activity by SHP1 caused a decrease in activation of Erk2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and abolished PKB/Akt (protein kinase B) phosphorylation. In addition, diminished Ret-9bp autophosphorylation led to reduced phosphorylation of the transcription factor jun-D. Finally, the inhibitory effect on Ret-9bp signaling resulted in a 40-60% reduction of [(3)H]thymidine incorporation and in reduced ability of NIH3T3 cells to form colonies in soft agar. In conclusion, the data suggest that SHP1 caused a moderate reduction of Ret autophosphorylation, which led to a strong suppression of the Ret oncogene activity.",

Follicular cell-derived tumors represent a wide spectrum of lesions, ranging from benign adenomas through differentiated (follicular and papillary) and undifferentiated (anaplastic) carcinomas, thus providing a good model for finding a correlation between specific genetic lesions and histologic phenotype. Follicular adenomas and carcinomas show frequently the presence of mutations in one of the three ras genes. Papillary carcinomas show frequently a specific gene rearrangement which gives rise to the formation of several types of so-called RET/PTC chimeric genes. This lesions occur in almost 50% of papillary cancers and consist in the juxtaposition of the 3' or tyrosine kinase domain of the RET gene (which codes for a receptor protein not normally expressed in follicular thyroid cells) with the 5' domain of ubiquitously expressed genes, which provide the promoter and dimerization functions, necessary for the constitutive activation of RET/PTC proteins. Anaplastic carcinomas are frequently associated with mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor. Finally, point mutations of the RET gene are found in familial endocrine syndromes (FMTC; MEN2A and MEN2B), a common feature of which is the medullary thyroid carcinoma, a malignant tumor derived from parafollicular C-cells.",

We retrospectively analyzed 61 patients with MEN 2, 28 with associated pheochromocytoma, regarding the relevance of specific mutations in the RET proto-oncogene and the diagnostic sensitivity of catecholamine screening and localization procedures. The present study shows that the position of the RET mutation is related to disease phenotype; codon 634 mutations are predictive of families predisposed to pheochromocytoma. In 18% of our patients, the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma preceded detection of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Therefore, mutation analysis of the RET gene should be performed in apparently \"sporadic\" cases of pheochromocytoma to confirm or exclude MEN 2. The most sensitive biochemical marker for pheochromocytoma in MEN 2 is 24-h urinary epinephrine excretion. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and MIBG scintigraphy are all highly sensitive methods to localize pheochromocytoma. We conclude that, in all families with MEN 2, mutational analysis of the RET proto-oncogene should be performed, both to identify gene carriers for MEN 2 and to identify specific mutations that are more strongly associated with pheochromocytoma.",

We report here on a rare extracellular mutation of the RET gene that led to the substitution of a tyrosine for an aspartate in codon 631 (D631Y, GAC to TAC) in two Korean families with MEN 2A. Eleven individuals from two unrelated families were found to have the D631Y germline mutation. Among them, medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) was identified in five patients: four of them had MEN 2A and one had familial MTC. They had tumors 2 cm or less in the greatest dimension that were limited to the thyroid, and they had a relatively old age above 30 at the time of diagnosis. Pheochromocytoma was detected in six patients including the four patients who had MEN 2A. All had adrenal tumors greater than 3 cm in the greatest dimension, and four of them had bilateral tumors. Two of six patients suffering with pheochromocytoma had no clinical evidence of MTC at the time of diagnosis. None had any evidence of hyperparathyroidism. This genetic profile might be related to the less vigorous clinical disease behavior and the late onset of MTC. In addition, pheochromocytoma might be the first manifestation prior to the development of MTC in some patients with the D631Y mutation. This report is the first description of the clinical characteristics of the D631Y germline mutation in the families with MEN 2A.",

No correlation among serum CT, age, and type of RET mutation was observed. Thirty GC were still biochemically negative at the annual control.;The time of thyroidectomy in GC with negative CT could be personalized and safely planned when stimulated CT becomes positive, independent of the type of RET mutation and patient's age.

Effects on cell proliferation and RET and ERK expression and activation were determined.;XL184 and vandetanib most effectively inhibited cell proliferation, RET autophosphorylation in combination with a reduction of RET expression, and ERK phosphorylation in MTC-TT and MZ-CRC-1, respectively. TPC-1 cells showed a decrease in RET autophosphorylation after treatment with XL184, but no effect was observed on ERK activation.;There is indeed specificity for different RET mutations, with XL184 being the most potent inhibitor in MEN2A and PTC and vandetanib the most effective in MEN2B in vitro.

Cabozantinib is a potent inhibitor of MET, RET, and vascular endothelial factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), as well as other tyrosine kinases that have been implicated in tumor development and progression. The object of this study was to determine the in vitro biochemical and cellular inhibitory profile of cabozantinib against RET, and in vivo antitumor efficacy using a xenograft model of MTC.;Cabozantinib was evaluated in biochemical and cell-based assays that determined the potency of the compound against wild type and activating mutant forms of RET. Additionally, the pharmacodynamic modulation of RET and MET and in vivo antitumor activity of cabozantinib was examined in a MTC tumor model following subchronic oral administration.;In biochemical assays, cabozantinib inhibited multiple forms of oncogenic RET kinase activity, including M918T and Y791F mutants. Additionally, it inhibited proliferation of TT tumor cells that harbor a C634W activating mutation of RET that is most often associated with MEN2A and familial MTC. In these same cells grown as xenograft tumors in nude mice, oral administration of cabozantinib resulted in dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition that correlated with a reduction in circulating plasma calcitonin levels. Moreover, immunohistochemical analyses of tumors revealed that cabozantinib reduced levels of phosphorylated MET and RET, and decreased tumor cellularity, proliferation, and vascularization.;Cabozantinib is a potent inhibitor of RET and prevalent mutationally activated forms of RET known to be associated with MTC, and effectively inhibits the growth of a MTC tumor cell model in vitro and in vivo.",

Here we present a comprehensive genetic and clinical analysis of MEN2 among Chinese families followed from 1975 to 2011. Our series comprises 36 index cases and 134 relatives from 11 independent families.;Genetic diagnosis was performed in all participants by direct sequencing all relevant RET exons. Thyroidectomy was performed in 50 patients with varying cervical neck dissection procedures. Patients with pheochromocytoma (PHEO) underwent specific surgery. Demographic, clinical profiles, mutation types, tumor histopathologic features, and follow-up records were systematically analyzed.;The RET mutations p.C634Y (n=34), p.C634R (n=6), p.C618S (n=13), p.V292M/R67H/R982C (n=7), p.L790F (n=2), and p.C634Y/V292M/R67H/R982C (n=1) were confirmed in 31 index cases and then identified in 32 at-risk relatives (mutation carriers), with MEN2A as the most common clinical subtype. The overall penetrance of PHEO in patients with MEN2A was 46.7%. A total of 50 patients underwent thyroidectomy, and there was a significant lowering of their mean age at thyroidectomy and the tumor diameter of the mutation carriers that were detected and operated on compared with the index cases (age at first surgery: 29.3 vs. 39.3 years, p<0.05; maximum size: 1.1 vs. 3.3 cm, p<0.001). There was also a decrease in the TNM staging and the proportion of patients who underwent inappropriate initial thyroid surgery (pN1: 31.6% vs. 100%, p<0.001; inappropriate surgery: 0% vs. 29%). Meanwhile, disease-free survival (DFS) increased (DFS: 100% vs. 58.1%, p<0.05).

The MTC tumor cells secrete the polypeptide hormone calcitonin, which serves as an excellent tumor marker, useful for defining the presence of disease, preoperatively or following thyroidectomy. The discovery that mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are associated with MEN-II syndromes was highly significant in that it demonstrated a clear correlation between genotype and phenotype; and most importantly it provided a mechanism whereby family members at risk could be identified by direct DNA analysis. Virtually all patients with MEN-IIA, MEN-IIB, and FMTC develop MTC; therefore there is a clear rationale for performing thyroidectomy as soon as a RET mutation has been identified. Because MTC appears to be much more aggressive in patients with MEN-IIB, thyroidectomy is performed during the first year of life in this setting, whereas in patients with MEN-IIA, where the tumor appears to be more indolent, the procedure can be safety delayed until age 5 years. Reoperative neck exploration in patients with evidence of persistent or recurrent MTC has been effective in a significant number of patients, although the success of the operation requires careful patient selection and preoperative assessment. MTC, as expressed in the MEN-II syndromes, is an excellent model to evaluate the usefulness of interventional therapy in patients demonstrated to have a genetic predisposition for cancer.",

Leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) protein is a widely expressed receptor-type protein-tyrosine-phosphatase that is implicated in the regulation of intracellular signaling triggered by both cell adhesion and peptide growth factors. The gene for LAR is localized to human chromosome 1p32, a region frequently deleted in tumors of neuroectodermal origin, including neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and medullary thyroid carcinoma. On the other hand, the RET gene codes for a transmembrane tyrosine kinase and is responsible for the development of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A and 2B. To explore the potential role of LAR in RET tyrosine kinase activity and RET-induced signal transduction, we cotransfected LAR and RET with a MEN2A or MEN2B mutation (designated RET-MEN2A or RET-MEN2B) into the NIH 3T3 cell line. Here we show that LAR reduces the constitutive tyrosine autophosphorylation and kinase activity of RET-MEN2A but not RET-MEN2B, accompanying a significant decrease of phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma, AKT, and ERK1/2. Interestingly, LAR expression significantly decreased the levels of disulfide-linked RET-MEN2A dimerization. Moreover, reduced oncogenic activity of RET-MEN2A by overexpression of LAR was observed both by an in vitro colony formation assay and by in vivo tumorigenicity in scid mice. These results thus suggest that LAR may contribute to deactivation of the RET-MEN2A mutant protein and reduction of its oncogenic activity in vivo.",

An analysis of 39 individuals from these families was included in this study. Thirty-two individuals (14 males, 18 females) had previously been determined as RET mutation negative. Seven individuals (6 males, 1 female) had previously been determined as RET mutation positive. Two RET mutation negative males had thyroidectomy based on prior pentagastrin test results.;Serum calcitonin levels in response to stimulation with pentagastrin were measured at 0, 1, 2, 5 and 10 minutes post injection. Mutation analysis of the RET proto-oncogene was performed in all individuals. In two RET mutation negative individuals from two MEN 2A families, thyroidectomy was performed and C-cells were quantitated in order to determine the diagnosis of C-cell hyperplasia.;There was a statistically significant difference (P < 0.013) between RET mutation negative male and female mean peak calcitonin responses of 282 +/- 236 and 96 +/- 62 (mean +/- SD) ng/l respectively. False positive responses to pentagastrin stimulation were identified in seven individuals who were RET mutation negative in two of the 16 families. Histologic examination of the thyroid glands in the two RET mutation negative individuals who had thyroidectomy demonstrated C-cell hyperplasia in one but not in the other.;There is considerable overlap between pentagastrin test results in individuals who are RET mutation positive and those who are RET mutation negative. These results indicate a need for routine performance of RET proto-oncogene analysis on all individuals at risk of developing MEN 2A or FMTC and a coupling of pentagastrin test results and RET proto-oncogene analysis in the decision to proceed with thyroidectomy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Mutations of the RET gene, encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase, have been associated with the inherited cancer syndromes MEN 2A and MEN 2B. They have also further been associated with both familial and sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas. Missense mutations affecting cysteine residues within the extracellular domain of the receptor causes constitutive tyrosine kinase activation through the formation of disulfide-bonded homodimers. We have recently reported that a somatic 6 bp in-frame deletion, originally coding for Glu632-Leu633, potently activates the RET gene. This activation is increased with respect to the frequent MEN 2A-associated missense mutation Cys634Arg. This finding specifically correlated to the clinic behavior of the corresponding tumor, which was characterized by an unusually aggressive progression with both multiple and recurrent metastases. By examining the possibility that this deletion acts in a manner similar to cysteine substitution, we have analysed the molecular mechanism by which this oncogenic activation occurs. Phosphorylated dimers of the deleted Ret receptor were detected in immunoprecipitates separated under non-reducing conditions. Like other Cys point mutations, this 6 bp deletion affecting two amino acid residues between two adjacent Cys, is capable of activating the transforming ability of Ret by promoting receptor dimerization. These results suggest that alteration to cysteine residue position or pairing is capable of inducing ligand independent dimerization. Furthermore, we present data demonstrating that the processing and sorting of the Ret membrane receptor to the cell surface is affected by mutation type.",

Multiple endocrine neoplasia IIa and IIb and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma are inherited conditions with autosomal dominance and incomplete penetrance. Traditionally, diagnosis and screening for these conditions have been done using pentagastrin stimulation tests and plasma calcitonin determinations. Recent genetic mapping, however, has assigned the genes responsible for these tumors to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 10. Available data suggest that mutations in exon 10, 11, or 16 of the RET proto-oncogene are responsible for MEN IIa and IIb and familial non-MEN medullary thyroid carcinoma. Thus, genetic testing can identify affected members of a kindred and will probably lead to early thyroidectomy and possible cure for gene carriers.;Early studies confirm the usefulness of DNA analysis in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with familial forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma.

The mTOR inhibitor everolimus has shown encouraging results in neuroendocrine tumors. As part of a prospective phase II study, we analyzed the safety and efficacy of everolimus in advanced MTC. Methods. Seven patients with per RECIST 1.1 documented advanced MTC were included and received everolimus 10 mg daily. The primary objective was determining treatment efficacy. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), toxicity, and pharmacokinetics (PK). Results. Median follow-up duration was 28 weeks (17-147). Five patients (71%) showed SD, of which 4 (57%) showed SD >24 weeks. Median PFS and OS were 33 (95%CI: 8-56) and 30 (95%CI: 15-45) weeks, respectively. Toxicity was predominantly grade 1/2 and included mucositis (43%), fatigue (43%), and hypertriglyceridemia (43%). Four MTCs harbored the somatic RET mutation c.2753T>C, p.Met918Thr. The best clinical response was seen in a MEN2A patient. PK characteristics were consistent with phase I data. One patient exhibited extensive toxicity accompanying elevated everolimus plasma concentrations. Conclusions. This study suggests that everolimus exerts clinically relevant antitumor activity in patients with advanced MTC. Given the high level of clinical benefit and the relatively low toxicity profile, further investigation of everolimus in these patients is warranted. ",

MEN 2B is associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma with oral, ocular, and alimentary submucosal ganglioneuromas and Marfanoid body features. Approximately 50% of cases are thought to be spontaneous mutations. The RET protooncogene (RET) is a 21-exon gene encoding a tyrosine kinase receptor. A codon 918 germ line mutation, which converts a highly conserved methionine to a threonine in the intracellular tyrosine kinase portion of this receptor of RET, has been identified in 95% of patients with MEN 2B. This mutation is easily detected by a direct deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing or restriction enzyme (Fok 1) analysis of amplified polymerase chain reaction products. The RET gene is normally expressed in the oral and gastrointestinal submucosal neural ganglia, and the codon 918 mutation is thought to cause neuromas by virtue of its transforming activity in these ganglia. Identifying clinical features of MEN 2B in an 11-year-old boy by an oral pathologist led to confirmation by mutational analysis. Before genetic testing was available, the patient, and at a later date his mother, underwent thyroidectomies based solely on biochemical testing. Results indicated the patient had the codon 918 mutation, whereas his phenotypically normal mother, father, and older brother had normal RET analyses. Studies in families have demonstrated that the mutant allele is derived from the father with possible acquisition during spermatogenesis. We believe the mother of our affected patient to be normal; the absence of phenotypic features of MEN 2B and a normal genotype suggest her calcitonin abnormalities and minimal evidence for C-cell hyperplasia were inconsequential. Molecular analysis for RET abnormalities will likely supplant biochemical methods of diagnosis in patients with MEN 2B.",

In members of a MEN2 family, carrying a RET mutation, CCH is constant and associated with micro-MTC. At least 20% of patients with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis or with a thyroid tumor other than MTC have CCH that, in a few cases, is associated with hypercalcitoninemia. 20 % normal subjects meet quantitative criteria of CCH. Patients belonging to a MEN2 family, without a RET mutation but presenting hypercalcitoninemia, could belong to this group. HCC appears to be a pre-neoplastic condition only in patients carrying a RET mutation. Under other circumstances, HCC may be either a reactive or even a normal condition.",

MTC is the major cause of mortality, and often appears during the 1st decade of life. RET proto-oncogene mutations are responsible for MEN 2B. Other RET mutations cause MEN 2A syndrome, familial MTC, or Hirschsprung's disease. We studied three MEN 2B patients with the aim of delineating the best diagnostic and therapeutic protocol. The gold standards for diagnosis are histochemical study of the rectal mucosa and molecular analysis of RET, which in familial cases detects MEN 2B at a preclinical stage so that early total prophylactic thyroidectomy can be performed. In non-familial cases, the diagnosis can be suggested by the presence of GI symptoms, ganglioneuromas, and/or the typical facies. The intestinal innervation pattern, analyzed with the acetylcholinesterase technique, is pathognomonic for MEN 2B. In our protocol a rectal biopsy is, therefore, the first measure. The surgical treatment of MEN 2B is total thyroidectomy with cervical lymphadenectomy of the central compartment of the neck. When possible, this intervention should be performed prophylactically before 1 year of age.",

The identification and characterization of novel RET mutations involved in MTC is valuable, as RET gene testing plays a crucial role in the management of these patients. In an MTC patient, we have identified a germline c.1996A>G transition in heterozygosis leading to K666E substitution. In addition, the conservative S904S (c.2712C>G) and the non-conservative functional G691S (c.2071G>A) polymorphisms have been identified. Through functional studies, we demonstrate for the first time that K666E is a gain-of-function mutation with oncogenic potential, based on its ability to transform NIH3T3 cells. It was not possible to define whether K666E is a de novo or inherited RET variant in the patient, as the family history was negative for MTC, and the carrier status of family members could not be tested. Our results, together with a recent report of co-segregation of the mutation in three MTC families, suggest that K666E is a causative MTC mutation. As we have shown that the same patient allele carries both K666E and G691S variants, the latter known to increase downstream RET signaling, a possible role for the G691S polymorphism has also been investigated. We have demonstrated that, although RET-G691S is not oncogenic per se, it enhances the transforming activity of the RET-K666E mutant, thus suggesting a modifier role for this functional polymorphism.",

MEN2 has been reported in approximately 500 to 1000 families worldwide and the prevalence has been estimated at approximately 1:30,000. Two different forms, sporadic and familial, have been described for MEN2. Sporadic form is represented by a case with two of the principal MEN2-related endocrine tumors. The familial form, which is more frequent and with an autosomal pattern of inheritance, consists of a MEN2 case with at least one first degree relative showing one of the characteristic endocrine tumors. Familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) is a subtype of MEN2 in which the affected individuals develop only medullary thyroid carcinoma, without other clinical manifestations of MEN2. Predisposition to MEN2 is caused by germline activating mutations of the c-RET proto-oncogene on chromosome 10q11.2. The RET gene encodes a single-pass transmembrane tyrosine kinase that is the receptor for glial-derived neurotrophic growth factors. The combination of clinical and genetic investigations, together with the improved understanding of the molecular and clinical genetics of the syndrome, helps the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Currently, DNA testing makes possible the early detection of asymptomatic gene carriers, allowing to identify and treat the neoplastic lesions at an earlier stage. In particular, the identification of a strong genotype-phenotype correlation in MEN2 syndrome may enable a more individualized treatment for the patients, improving their quality of life. At present, surgical treatment offers the only chance of cure and therefore, early clinical and genetic detection and prophylactic surgery in subjects at risk are the main therapeutic goal.",

Germ-line mutations of the RET proto-oncogene cause hereditary forms of cancer, whereas somatic mutations can be present in sporadic forms of the disease. The RET gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the activation of intracellular signaling pathways leading to proliferation, growth, differentiation, migration, and survival. Nowadays, early diagnosis of MTC followed by total thyroidectomy offers the only possibility of cure. Based on the knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms of MTC, new drugs have been developed in an attempt to control metastatic disease. Of these, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors represent one of the most promising agents for MTC treatment, and clinical trials have shown encouraging results. Hopefully, the cumulative knowledge about the targets of action of these drugs and about the tyrosine kinase inhibitor-associated side effects will help in choosing the best therapeutic approach to enhance their benefits.",

Therefore genetic testing is recommended for all patients presenting with MTC. Approximately 40% of MTCs have somatic RET mutations. Somatic mutations in the RAS genes are the next most common driver mutations and appear to be mutually exclusive with germline RET mutation. The single most common somatic RAS mutation is HRASQ61R (c.182A>G), reported in 4.6% to 11% of all MTCs. Mutation-specific immunohistochemistry (IHC) initially developed to identify the NRASQ61R mutation in melanoma (clone SP174) has proven highly sensitive and specific. Because the amino acid sequences for the HRAS and NRAS proteins at codon 61 are identical, we postulated that SP174 IHC would also identify the somatic HRASQ61R mutation. IHC with SP174 was performed on a tissue microarray of 68 patients with MTC including 13 (22.8%) with molecularly confirmed MEN2. Seven (10.3%) MTCs demonstrated positive staining. Six of these patients had already undergone germline RET mutation testing as part of clinical care and were all confirmed to be wild type, excluding the diagnosis of MEN2. All SP174 immunohistochemically positive MTCs were proven to have HRASQ61R mutation (and lack KRASQ61R and NRASQ61R) by Sanger sequencing. All MEN2 patients showed negative staining. We conclude that IHC with SP174 is highly specific for the HRASQ61R mutation in MTC. Because current data suggest that this mutation is mutually exclusive with germline RET mutation, IHC may also have a role in triaging formal genetic testing for MEN2.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

        "Doc_abstract":"Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several forms of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN-2) is an autosomal dominant syndrome caused by germline activating mutations of the RET proto-oncogene and has been categorized into three distinct clinical forms. MEN-2A is associated with MTC, bilateral pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism. MEN-2B is associated with MTC, bilateral pheochromocytoma, and mucosal neuromas. The rarest clinical form of MEN-2 is familial MTC (FMTC), which is also associated with MTC, but other endocrinopathies are characteristically not present. Each clinical form of MEN-2 results from a specific RET gene mutation, with a strong correlation of phenotype expression with regard to the onset and course of MTC and the presence of other endocrine tumors and a corresponding genotype. Recommendations for screening of RET mutations are necessary as their presence or absence will influence interventional strategies such as the timing of a prophylactic thyroidectomy and extent of surgery. Timing of screenings and development of interventional strategies are extremely important in caring for patients with certain RET mutations as evidence of metastatic MTC has been documented as early as 6 years of age. Interventional strategies should consider the risks of complications of these interventions based on certain characteristics of each individual case such as age of the patient, course of disease in affected family members, and the invasiveness of any proposed surgical procedure.",

The age-related risk of MTC is associated with the type of RET mutation. Our aim was to identify prognostic factors associated with recurrent MTC in MEN 2 patients. METHODS In a nationwide case-control study, all patients who underwent total thyroidectomy in the Netherlands under the age of 20 years were classified into standard (1), high (2), or very high risk (3) for MTC based on RET-mutation type. Disease-free patients were compared with those with recurrent disease. RESULTS A total of 93 patients were included in the study. Sixty-six percent had MTC on histology, the youngest being 1 year old. Codon 634 was most affected. Sixteen (18%) patients had persistent or recurrent disease, one of whom died. Significantly associated determinants of outcome in univariate analysis were higher age at surgery, no age-appropriate prophylactic surgery according to risk level, elevated preoperative calcitonin levels, affected codon, and the presence of lymph node metastases at surgery. On multivariate analysis only age of surgery was the single independent factor associated with persistent disease. CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic thyroidectomy beyond the recommended age is associated with persistent/recurrent disease. In addition, codon 634 mutation is associated with a high risk of recurrence requiring early surgery for all these patients.",

In the first patient, histology, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy demonstrated an MTC in the one nodule and PTC in two additional lesions. Non-neoplastic thyroid parenchyma separated the three nodules. Metastasis from PTC was diagnosed in a regional lymph node. Genetic analysis of both tumour components showed a distinctive mutational pattern: in the MTC a Cys634Arg substitution in exon 11 of the RET gene and in the two PTC foci a Val600Glu substitution in exon 15 of the BRAF gene. The other two patients are members of a large multigenerational family affected with familial MTC due to a germline mutation of the RET gene (Ala891Ser). Both patients harboured, besides medullary cancer and C-cell hyperplasia, distinct foci of papillary thyroid cancer, which was positive for Val600Glu BRAF mutation. Review of the literature disclosed 18 similar lesions reported and allowed the identification of different patterns of clinical presentation and biological behaviour. So far, the pathogenesis of these peculiar cases of thyroid malignancy has been completely unknown, but an underlying common genetic drive has been hypothesised.

In MEN type 1, the major lesions affect parathyroid glands, pancreatic islet cells and anterior pituitary. The MEN-1 gene has been mapped to chromosome 11q13 and a set of DNA-polymorphic markers localized close to this region provides a useful tool for presymptomatic diagnosis in MEN-1 families. MEN type 2 refers to the inherited forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) associated or not with pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism. In MEN-2, germinal mutations of the C-RET proto-oncogene which is localized on chromosome 10q11 have been found in the three clinical and allelic forms of the syndrome respectively, MEN-2 type A, B and familial isolated MTC. Mutations of C-RET are found in more than 90% of MEN-2 patients and genetic screening leads to accurate risk evaluation in families and consequently a preventive treatment of MTC and adrenal neoplasms. Recent discoveries on MEN syndromes and related familial endocrine disorders have a major clinical impact and allow a better understanding of the physiological pathways involved in familial as well as in sporadic endocrine tumor pathogenesis.",

NVP-AST487, a N,N'-diphenyl urea with an IC(50) of 0.88 mumol/L on RET kinase, inhibited RET autophosphorylation and activation of downstream effectors, and potently inhibited the growth of human thyroid cancer cell lines with activating mutations of RET but not of lines without RET mutations. NVP-AST487 induced a dose-dependent growth inhibition of xenografts of NIH3T3 cells expressing oncogenic RET, and of the MTC cell line TT in nude mice. MTCs secrete calcitonin, a useful indicator of tumor burden. Human plasma calcitonin levels derived from the TT cell xenografts were inhibited shortly after treatment, when tumor volume was still unchanged, indicating that the effects of RET kinase inhibition on calcitonin secretion were temporally dissociated from its tumor-inhibitory properties. Accordingly, NVP-AST487 inhibited calcitonin gene expression in vitro in TT cells, in part, through decreased gene transcription. These data point to a previously unknown physiologic role of RET signaling on calcitonin gene expression. Indeed, the RET ligands persephin and GDNF robustly stimulated calcitonin mRNA, which was blocked by pretreatment with NVP-AST487. Antagonists of RET kinase activity in patients with MTC may result in effects on plasma calcitonin that are either disproportionate or dissociated from the effects on tumor burden, because RET kinase mediates a physiologic pathway controlling calcitonin secretion. The role of traditional tumor biomarkers may need to be reassessed as targeted therapies designed against oncoproteins with key roles in pathogenesis are implemented.",

Ninety-one individuals participated in clinical and genetic screening, which included serum calcitonin and thyroid ultrasound (US) with cytology. Exons 10, 11, 13, and 16 were sequenced in all, and all exons of RET in 43 of the subjects, including those with thyroid cancer, RET mutations, suspicious clinical findings, and familial or long-segment disease. Through the cancer registry, two cases (aged 35 and 37 years) of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) were observed; the incidence for MTC was 340-fold (95% CI 52-1600) compared with average population. These individuals had C611R and C620R mutations in exon 10. One papillary thyroid cancer without RET mutations was detected by clinical screening. Four subjects (aged 31-50 years) with co-occurring RET mutations in exons 10 (C609R; n=1) and 13 (Y791F, n=3) had sporadic short-segment HD with normal thyroid US and serum calcitonin. Three novel mutations and five single-nucleotide polymorphisms were found outside exons 10 and 13 without associated signs of thyroid cancer. MTC-associated RET mutations were restricted to exons 10 and 13 affecting ∼5% of unselected adults with HD. Clinical thyroid assessment did not improve accuracy of genetic screening, which should not be limited to patients with familial or long-segment disease. ",

JC-1 staining and caspase-3 cleavage assays were performed to measure mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis. Activation of RET signaling was examined by Western blot. Autophagy was monitored by the detection of the light-chain 3BII. Expression of HSP90 and LC3B were examined in 36 human MTCs.;At a therapeutic serum concentration (10 μM), NFV inhibited the viability of TT and MZ-CRC-1 cells by 55% and 10%, respectively. In a dose-dependent manner, NFV inhibited cyclin D1 and caused caspase-3 cleavage. NFV decreased the level of RET protein and blocked the activation of RET downstream targets (phosphorylated ERK, phosphorylated AKT, and p70S6K/pS6). NFV induced metabolic stress, activated AMP-activated protein kinase and increased autophagic flux. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy (chloroquine) augmented NFV-inducible cytotoxicity, suggesting that autophagy was protective in NFV-treated cells. NFV led to mitochondrial membrane depolarization and induced both oxidative stress and DNA damage. An antioxidant (n-acetylcysteine) attenuated DNA damage and prevented NFV-inducible apoptosis. HSP90 overexpression was found in 17 of 36 human MTCs and correlated with metastases and RET mutations. LC3B was detected in 20 of 36 human MTCs.;NFV has a wide spectrum of activity against MTC cells, and its cytotoxicity can be augmented by inhibiting autophagy. Expression of NFV molecular targets in metastatic MTC suggests that NFV has a potential to become a thyroid cancer therapeutic agent.",

The most commonly studied exons in index cases are 8, 10, 11, and 13-16. To address the ATA guidelines regarding the sequencing of the entire coding region of RET, we selected 50 patients with sporadic MTC (sMTC) without mutations in the hot spot regions of RET for extended investigation of exons 1-7, 9, 12, 17, 18, and 19. Twenty-seven of 50 patients presented with one or more features suggesting familial disease. We found only a new RET variant (p.Gly550Glu) in one patient with MTC. Several polymorphisms were observed, and their frequency was histogram scaled by exons and introns. Eight patients were also included for somatic mutation search. We estimated the sequencing cost by stratifying into four investigation approaches: (1) hot spot exons in a new patient, (2) the remaining exons if the hot spots are negative in a patient with suspected familial disease, (3) a relative of a carrier for a known RET mutation, and (4) tumor sequencing. In spite of the increasing number of variants being described in MTC, it appears that there is no direct clinical benefit in extending RET germ line analysis beyond the hot spot regions in sMTC. The cost evaluation in apparent sMTC using a tiered approach may help clinicians make more suitable decisions regarding the benefits of investigating only the hot spots against the entire coding region of RET.",

Elevations in serum calcium trigger release of calcitonin from the C-cell, which in turn functions to inhibit absorption of calcium by the intestine, resorption of bone by the osteoclast, and reabsorption of calcium by renal tubular cells. Oncogenic transformation of the thyroid C-cell is thought to progress through a hyperplastic process prior to malignancy with increasing levels of serum calcitonin serving as a biomarker for tumor burden. The discovery that multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is caused by activating mutations of the RET gene serves to highlight the RET-RAS-MAPK signaling pathway in both initiation and progression of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Thyroid C-cells are known to express RET at high levels relative to most cell types; therefore, aberrant activation of this receptor is targeted primarily to the C-cell, providing one possible cause of tissue-specific oncogenesis. The role of RET signaling in normal C-cell function is unknown though calcitonin gene transcription appears to be sensitive to RET activation. Beyond RET, the modeling of oncogenesis in animals and screening of human tumors for candidate gene mutations have uncovered mutation of RAS family members and inactivation of Rb1 regulatory pathway as potential mediators of C-cell transformation. A growing understanding of how RET interacts with these pathways, both in normal C-cell function and during oncogenic transformation, will help in the development of novel molecular-targeted therapies.

RET germline mutations cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndrome (MEN 2A) characterized by complete penetrance of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and lower prevalence of Pheo and hyperparathyroidism. We describe the genetic etiology of an apparently sporadic case of monolateral Pheo in a 42-year-old male patient. A new (not previously reported) MEN 2A-associated germline RET mutation located in exon 11 (Glu632Gly, caused by an A>G point mutation at position 1895 of the RET cDNA) was found in the patient but not in his living first-degree relatives. This observation increases the number of possible germline RET mutations. Genotype-phenotype correlation of this new genetic alteration is unknown, but this rare mutation is probably associated with a low risk for MTC (usually the first tumor diagnosed in MEN 2A syndrome) and with the development of Pheo before the onset of MTC. Since we expect MTC to occur in our patient, strict follow-up is mandatory.

The clinical characteristics of the patients were obtained from a previous nationwide questionnaire survey.;Overall, 62 (96.9%) out of 64 patients had a germ-line point mutation at the hot spots. MTC and pheochromocytoma occurred equally in every genotype except C630S. Specific genotype had a correlation between tumor size and age at the operation for MTC or extent of MTC, i.e. C618S developed late onset type of MTC as compared with that of C634R, C634Y and M918T. Small MTC in C634R may be less aggressive than those in C634Y and M918T.;DNA testing has good clinical implications for the management of patients with MEN 2 and the timing and operative procedures of thyroidectomy can be modified according to the genotype.",

In vitro studies have certain pitfalls, one of which is the use of cell culture systems such as the NIH3T3 cells, in which RET usually is not expressed in contrast to the in vivo situation. Recent data suggest that an overrepresentation of mutant RET as a 'second hit' event might trigger tumorigenesis. However, alterations in other genes might contribute to this overrepresentation of RET or impact on MEN 2-related tumor development through completely different mechanisms and pathways. The final goal of further elucidating the natural history and pathogenesis of MEN2-related tumors should be the chance to offer patients with RET germline mutations an optimal cancer prevention (e.g. codon specific recommendations for prophylactic thyroidectomy) and treatment program, especially for metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma for which presently no effective therapy other than surgery exists.",

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) may have a very benign course while undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UTC) belongs to the most aggressive human malignancies. A variety of genes have been identified to be involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid carcinoma. Somatic Ras mutations seem to be an early event and are frequently found in follicular thyroid carcinomas. Somatic rearrangements of RET and TRK are almost exclusively found in PTC and may be found in early stages. Germline RET missense mutations lead to hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). In contrast, the significance of somatic RET mutations in sporadic MTC is unknown. p53 seems to play a crucial role in the dedifferentiation process of thyroid carcinoma. The precise role of PTEN remains to be elucidated. The only clearly identified exogenous factor that may lead to thyroid carcinoma (mainly PTC) is radiation. Of interest, radiation is capable to induce RET rearrangements. In general, early diagnosis is mandatory to enable the chance of cure. Surgery is the treatment of choice. Depending on the tumour type, surgery in combination with either radioiodine, external radiation or chemotherapy often enables the control of local tumour burden. In MTC and UTC, once thyroid cancer is spread to distant organs, efficacious therapeutic agents are almost non-existing. However, our growing knowledge of genes involved in thyroidal oncogenesis may contribute to the development of more effective treatment modalities. Some preliminary data on gene therapy are quite promising.",

In humans, indirect measurements based on age dependent tumor incidence predict that, on average, the accumulation of 5 to 6 different steps is needed to initiate tumor formation. These mutations do not appear to be random, in that certain neoplasms show prediction for structural aberrations in specific genes. In thyroid tumors, some of gene abnormalities were found. The point mutations of ras oncogenes, predominantly H-ras codon 12, are found in 20-25% of follicular adenomas and papillary carcinomas. Recently, the gene rearrangements of the oncogenes trk and ret were identified in the DNA from papillary carcinomas. About 25% of papillary carcinomas contained an introchromosomal (10q) gene rearrangement involving the tyrosine kinase domain of the ret oncogene with an unknown amino-terminal sequence. The mutations of trk and/or ret were not observed in other thyroid neoplastic phenotypes. In medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is a tumor of the parafollicular, calcitonin-secreting C cell of the thyroid, approximately 20% of patients have autosomal dominant inherited forms. Germ line abnormalities on chromosome 10 are linked to at least one type of genetic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MEN type 2a).

However, even in typical MEN-2B, extrathyroidal manifestations of MEN-2B can be found to be differently expressed. We analyzed the clinical manifestation and course in 21 patients harboring a de novo RET M918T mutation. Mean age at MEN-2B diagnosis was 14.2 years (range: 1-31 years). All patients had medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). At the time of syndrome diagnosis, oral manifestations (bumpy lips, ganglioneuroma), ocular manifestations (corneal fibers, conjunctivitis sicca), intestinal dysfunctions, musculoskeletal manifestations, and pheochromocytoma were found in 86%, 90%, 74%, 79%, and 19% of the patients, respectively. At the time of follow-up examination, the symptoms were found at higher frequency. Severe intestinal manifestation was predominantly found in patients with prepubertal onset (< or = 12 years) of MTC (n = 4/10) compared with patients with late onset (> 12 years) of MTC (n = 0/11) (40% versus 0%; p = 0.019). Although biochemical cure was found only in four patients with early onset of MTC, the long-term prognosis for patients with early onset of MTC was poorer than for patients presenting with late onset of MTC (p = 0.005). During mean follow-up of 55.8 months (range: 3-161 months), seven patients (33%) died from MTC. In conclusion, whereas most typical MEN-2B symptoms were found to be age-related, severe intestinal manifestation was found to be predominantly expressed in patients with early onset of MTC. Furthermore, in patients with early onset of MTC who could not be biochemically cured, the long-term prognosis was found to be worse than that of non-cured patients with late onset of MTC, suggesting an additional pathological process in the younger subgroup reinforcing the very high transforming in vitro activity of the M918T RET mutation.",

Recently, germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene have been found in patients with these syndromes. Thus, with direct DNA testing, kindred members with MEN 2A, MEN 2B, or FMTC can be identified before clinical of biochemical evidence of MTC develops. It has been hypothesized that prophylactic thyroidectomy early in childhood, based on a positive genetic test, produces a better clinical outcome than thyroidectomy at the time MTC is diagnosed either clinically or biochemically. In the present report, the Washington University experience with MTC in children with MEN 2A and 2B is reviewed. Sixteen patients with MEN 2A who had thyroidectomy based on the biochemical diagnosis of MTC are compared with 14 children with MEN 2A who underwent prophylactic thyroidectomy based on direct genetic testing. In addition, the clinical results of 11 patients with MEN 2B treated for MTC are reviewed. After 3 years of follow-up there has been no biochemical or clinical evidence of MTC among the 14 children who had prophylactic thyroidectomy. Among the 16 children with MEN 2A who had thyroidectomy because of elevated basal of stimulated calcitonin levels, four (25%) have persistent of recurrent MTC after a mean follow-up period of 7.6 years. Of the 11 patients with MEN 2B who underwent thyroidectomy during childhood, one has died and seven (70%) of the remaining patients have recurrent MTC after a mean follow-up period of 11 years. The authors conclude that a significant number of children with MEN 2A or MEN 2B, who have clinical of biochemical evidence of MTC before thyroidectomy, have persistent or recurrent disease after long-term clinical follow-up. The diagnosis by direct DNA testing in patients with these syndromes allows prophylactic thyroidectomy before the development of extensive local or metastatic MTC.",

Although most, but not all, endocrine surgeons leave normal-appearing parathyroid glands in situ during thyroid surgery for MEN2A, we have employed total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation. Between 1994 and 2006, 12 MEN2A patients underwent therapeutic total or completion thyroidectomy and lymph nodes dissection at least in the central compartment for MTC. Total or completion parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation was performed concurrently with above-mentioned surgery. All patients were over 25 years old, and the median age was 48.5 years. There were 5 males and 7 females from 8 families. The average number of transplanted parathyroid glands was 3. Serum calcium and intact PTH levels have been maintained during the median follow up of 107 months in all patients except for one who of died of advanced MTC one year after surgery.

        "Doc_abstract":"Carcinoma of the thyroid gland is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system. Differentiated tumors are often curable with surgical resection and radioactive iodine. A small percentage of such patients, however, do not undergo remission and need new therapeutic approaches. Both anaplastic and medullary thyroid carcinomas exhibit aggressive behavior and are usually resistant to current therapeutic modalities. Thyroid carcinoma represents a fascinating model and a particularly promising paradigm for targeted therapy because some of the key oncogenic events are activating mutations of genes coding for tyrosine kinases, and these occur early in cancer development. A prototype is the RET proto-oncogene, a receptor tyrosine kinase, which is a key regulator of development and a 'hotspot' for oncogenic mutations. Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene have been identified as causative for papillary carcinoma and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma, making it an attractive target for selective inhibition in these subtypes. ZD 6474 has shown promising activity in preclinical models against RET kinase, and its contemporary inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor pathways renders it a very attractive drug for clinical trials in thyroid cancer. Activating point mutation of B-RAF can occur early in the development of papillary carcinoma. Moreover, papillary carcinomas with these mutations have more aggressive properties and are diagnosed more often at an advanced stage. Clinical evaluation of B-RAF-targeting drugs is undergoing and trials in thyroid cancer are planned. Agents that restore radioiodine uptake, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors and retinoids, represent another exciting field in new drug development in thyroid cancer.",

Xenogenic calcitonin was chosen for immunization due to its higher immunogenicity as compared with murine calcitonin.;Lymph nodes from control protein-immunized mice did not show any macroscopic abnormalities, whereas tumor peptide-treated mice revealed in general profoundly enlarged lymph nodes. In tetramer analysis of paratumorous lymph nodes, 1.9% to 3.1% of all infiltrating CD8(+) T cells were specific for one of three tumor epitopes tested. Analysis of the activated IFN-gamma-secreting component in splenic cells revealed an average of 2.8% tumor epitope-specific CD8(+) cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong CD8(+) tumor infiltration in calcitonin-vaccinated mice. In addition, these cells also showed strong in vitro lysis capacity at up to 63.3%. Most importantly, calcitonin-immunized mice revealed largely diminished tumor outgrowth (-74.3%) compared with control mice (P < 0.0001). Likewise, serum calcitonin levels in calcitonin-vaccinated Ret/Cal mice were lower than in the control group.;These results have a major effect, as they are the first to establish a role for xenogenic polypeptide hormones as target molecules for immunotherapy in endocrine malignancies.",

In 97% of MEN 2A patients, the germline mutation affects one of five cysteine codons within exons 10 and 11 in the extracellular domain. Only 65% of FMTC patients are found to have a germline mutation of RET. These mutations affect either the cysteine rich domain (as MEN 2A mutations) or codons 768 (exon 13) or 804 (exon 14) within the tyrosine kinase domain. In families affected with hereditary form of MTC, mutation analysis is now commonly used to determine genetic status. Individuals without the mutation would be considered unaffected and would not require further biochemical screening. Individuals who inherit the MEN 2 mutation would undergo biochemical screening tests and have thyroidectomy as soon as these tests are abnormal. Risk of phaeochromocytoma in affected patients depends on the position of RET mutation. This risk is high if the patient has a codon 634 mutation and low if he has a mutation within exon 10, 13 or 14. Frequency of adrenal follow-up could so be adapted with regards to the localisation of RET germline mutation. When a new MTC case is diagnosed, the distinction between a true sporadic and a de novo hereditary case is important for future clinical management of both the patient and his family. The absence of RET exons 10, 11, 13, and 14 germline mutations appears to rule out MEN 2A to a high probability. However the presence of a familial form of MTC cannot be excluded conclusively. Since codon 918 somatic mutations are found in 25% of MTC from truly sporadic cases, mutation analysis of RET in tumour DNA may help in distinguishing the sporadic cases from those that are in fact heritable.",

Over the past 15 years, the application of molecular technologies to the study of these neoplasms has elucidated critical genetic pathways associated with the development of specific thyroid tumor types. In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), genetic events involve RET and TRK (rearrangements) and BRAF and RAS (mutations), although RAS mutations are uncommon except in the follicular variant of PTC. These genetic alterations, which rarely overlap in the same tumor, result in signaling abnormalities in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In contrast, genetic alterations in follicular carcinomas include PAX8-PPARgamma translocations and RAS mutations while mutations of CTNNB1 and p53 have been implicated in the development and progression of poorly differentiated and undifferentiated (anaplastic) thyroid carcinomas. Germline mutations of RET are responsible for the development of heritable forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) while somatic mutations of this oncogene are found in a significant proportion of sporadic MTCs.

However, germline mutations may very occasionally occur in other exons, including exon 14 of the RET gene. Interestingly, an increased frequency of a rare germline sequence variant of the RET exon 14, S836S, has been detected in patients with sporadic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and this variant has been proposed to play a role in the genesis of MTC and, perhaps, FMTC. In this study we report the segregation of a germline V804L mutation and a germline sequence variant S836S in exon 14 of the RET gene in an extended Hungarian FMTC kindred comprising 80 individuals of four generations. Molecular analysis of the RET gene was performed by direct DNA sequencing in 23 family members, of whom 12 had the V804L mutation, three had the V804L mutation and S836S polymorphism in separate alleles, and six had the S836S polymorphism, all in heterozygous forms. Two of the family members had neither mutation nor polymorphism of the RET gene. Three of the family members who had the V804L mutation and one member who could not be tested for mutation were operated for non-metastatic MTC, while one member with MTC who had the V804L mutation refused surgery. In all patients affected with MTC, the disease developed relatively late in life and never caused death. None of the other family members carrying the V804L mutation and/or the S836S polymorphism had clinical or biochemical evidence of MTC. These observations suggest that the co-existence of the V804L mutation and S836S polymorphism in separate alleles does not seem to aggravate the relatively low-risk disease phenotype characteristic in most patients with codon 804 mutations of the RET exon 14.",

Usually, the patient presents with a thyroid mass or neck node metastasis along with high levels of calcitonin and preoperative fine needle aspiration biopsy suggestive of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. The role of genetic testing in such individuals, along with testing of other family members, remains somewhat unclear at this stage, especially in patients presenting with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Genetic testing with RET proto-oncogene mutational studies is very popular in familial medullary thyroid carcinoma, especially in children, with routine prophylactic thyroidectomy. However, its indications in adults remain unclear at this time.;Recently, a 69-year-old woman presented with a thyroid mass and underwent total thyroidectomy and central compartment dissection. She was found to have medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. The patient had four children, three of whom were found to have a RET mutation similar to their mother's, V804M. In view of the RET mutation, the three children were offered prophylactic thyroidectomy at ages 42, 45, and 47. The patient's son was noted to have extensive C-cell hyperplasia in both lobes of the thyroid. The other two individuals had benign pathology with no evidence of C-cell hyperplasia.;There is no definite consensus of opinion about the need for prophylactic total thyroidectomy in adults with RET mutation. The rarely reported 804 mutation is, however, a predictor of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. One individual in this group had extensive C-cell hyperplasia, suggesting that he would have developed medullary carcinoma of the thyroid in the future. Prophylactic thyroidectomy should be recommended in patients with RET mutation and a family history of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid; however, its role in adult family members needs to be evaluated with larger registry of prophylactic thyroidectomy. Whether these adults with rare 804-mutation could be observed and followed with serial calcitonin, ultrasound, or calcitonin stimulation tests remains to be studied.",

A 76-year-old man presented with a mass in the left thyroid with neither serological calcitonin elevation nor familial history. A thorough clinico-laboratorial study did not disclose any other mass elsewhere. A left hemithyroidectomy was performed, and the histological examination revealed a neuroendocrine carcinoma resembling a paraganglioma-like MTC displaying unequivocal signs of vascular invasion. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed reactivity for chromogranin A, synaptophysin, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), paired box gene 8 (PAX8), cytokeratins (AE1/AE3 and CK8/18), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and negativity for calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen, TTF-2, thyroperoxidase, and thyroglobulin. In situ hybridization showed that the tumor cells lacked expression for calcitonin and thyroglobulin mRNA. Genetic analysis did not disclose any RET mutation.

In the case of MEN 2, gain-of-function germline mutations clustered in specific codons of the RET proto-oncogene increase the risk of developing medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), phaeochromocytoma and parathyroid tumours. Offering RET testing is best practice for the clinical management of patients at-risk of MEN 2, and MEN 2 has become a classic model for the integration of molecular medicine into patient care. Prophylactic thyroidectomy in an asymptomatic RET mutation carrier to address the risk of developing MTC can prevent or cure this malignancy. No similar preventative strategies can be employed to prevent or cure MEN 1-associated tumours. Genetic testing for MEN 1 is therefore both more complex due to a general lack of mutational hotspots, and the benefit to patients is less straight forward. While a number of genotype-phenotype correlations exist in MEN 2, providing further rationale for performing genetic testing in this condition, these correlations are absent in MEN 1.

This article is an update on CCH physiopathology related to clinical presentation. With this combined approach, two types of CCH that differ by their physiological characteristics can be identified: neoplastic CCH and reactive (also called physiological) CCH. Neoplastic CCH is caused by a germline mutation of the RET protooncogene in a multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndrome. It progresses to MTC following a time line that depends on the RET mutation involved. CCH may actually be a misnomer for a neoplastic condition that some authors have proposed to call \"in situ-MTC\". Reactive CCH is considered to be caused by a stimulus that is external to the C-cell, and its premalignant potential is not documented. Many situations such as hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidy, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis or follicular tumors have been associated with reactive CCH, the pathogenesis of which remains unclear. But C-cell density in normal patients is subject to important variability, and several studies have demonstrated the dramatic male predominance in physiological CCH when hypercalcitoninemia was a random discovery. These data suggest that a number of conditions which were previously associated with reactive CCH might be purely fortuitous. Our clinical/pathological confrontation contributes to appropriately distinguishing between various CCH types, and in turn to identify the best way of managing patients.",

A careful work-up and a fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) are mandatory to improve the preoperative diagnosis. High-resolution thyroid ultrasound and real-time elastosonography are adjuvant presurgical tools in selecting patients for surgery, particularly those with indeterminate or non-diagnostic cytology. Elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level in a patient with a thyroid nodule is a new laboratory predictor of thyroid cancer risk. The majority of thyroid carcinomas derive from the follicular cell, whereas medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) derives from calcitonin-producing cells.

This drug has been tested in two important phase II studies which demonstrated that both the 100 and 300 mg/day dosage of vandetanib have antitumor activity on advanced MTC. A phase III trial (ZETA trial) evaluating vandetanib in 331 patients with locally advanced or metastatic MTC showed a significant prolongation of PFS for patients receiving vandetanib compared with placebo. Toxicity surveillance in all studies reported high rates of adverse effects with diarrhea, rash, fatigue and nausea being the most commonly experienced by patients. Vandetanib is currently approved in the United States for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC and has become a new standard of care in this rare and indolent pathology.",

The median age was 10 years (range: 0-08). Preoperative assessment, surgical procedure, pathological findings, postoperative complications and treatment results were studied and compared with data from the literature.;All 20 children underwent total thyroidectomy. In 17 children with preoperatively abnormal basal or stimulated calcitonin levels, total thyroidectomy was combined with tracheo-oesophageal exploration (n = 6) or central compartment dissection (n = 11). C-cell hyperplasia was found in 19 cases (95%) and medullary thyroid carcinoma in 14 (70%; aged 3-18 years). Lymph-node metastases were found in 3 children (15%), all over the age of 10. They underwent additional selective lateral neck dissection, unilateral in 2 cases and bilateral in 1. Two children developed hypoparathyroidism postoperatively, no recurrent laryngeal-nerve palsy was observed. All patients are clinically free of disease after a median follow-up of 9 years (range: 0.6-27). The patients with node metastases still have biochemical evidence of disease. The literature indicates that the progression of the malignant transformation to medullary thyroid carcinoma is connected to the type of RET-mutation. The treatment plan depends on the type of mutation.;Medullary thyroid cancer occurs at a very young age in carriers ofgermline RET mutations. In patients with high-risk mutations prophylactic thyroidectomy is likely to be recommended before the child reaches the age of 2. Elective central lymph-node dissection can be omitted in this instance. After this age, however, the risk of lymph-node metastases increases and, for cases with increased basal or stimulated calcitonin levels, total thyroidectomy with central compartment dissection is indicated.",

Most are caused by mutations in tumor suppressor genes. In HCS, a single copy of the mutated tumor suppressor gene is inherited, and mutation of the second wild type allele of the gene is required for tumorigenesis. Patients with HCS have a higher than normal risk of a second malignancy. Management strategies to address increased cancer risk in HCS include genetic counseling and testing, targeted surveillance, chemoprevention, and prophylactic surgery. Genetic testing for high-risk family members is strongly recommended. Available data indicate surgical prophylaxis is more successful than surveillance in reducing cancer risk in carriers of BRCA, CDH1, APC, and RET mutation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Control of cell growth and differentiation occurs via extracellular signals known as growth factors. Growth factors are high affinity ligands for transmembrane receptors belonging to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). A number of genetic evidences have implicated RTKs in human diseases including developmental disorders and cancer. For instance, germline missense mutations involving the Ret receptor are found in patients affected by multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B (MEN2A and MEN2B) or familial medullary thyroid carcinomas. Somatic mutations in the Kit receptor are found in mastocytomas and in gastrointestinal tumors. Germline and sporadic mutations of the Met receptor have been described in kidney and hepatocellular carcinomas. Overexpression of the HER-2/neu receptor in breast cancer has been associated with tumor progression. The enzymatic activity of RTKs is strictly regulated and is usually inhibited under basal conditions. Receptor activation triggers a biochemical signalling cascade inside the cytoplasm, named signal transduction, which is subverted during the malignant transformation of cells. Signal transduction by RTKs is a multistep process which includes: (i) Ligand binding and receptor dimerization, (ii) receptor phosphorylation on tyrosine residues; (iii) recruitment to the receptor and activation of cytoplasmic signaling molecules that transmit signals to the nucleus. Each of the steps involved in this process can potentially be targeted to block the aberrant properties of tyrosine kinase receptors. By using the MET oncogene as a model this review focuses on the strategies that can be applied to therapeutically target RTKs.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) is characterized by the occurrence of tumors involving two or more endocrine glands within a single patient. Four major forms of MEN, which are autosomal dominant disorders, are recognized and referred to as: MEN type 1 (MEN1), due to menin mutations; MEN2 (previously MEN2A) due to mutations of a tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the rearranged during transfection (RET) protoncogene; MEN3 (previously MEN2B) due to RET mutations; and MEN4 due to cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDNK1B) mutations. Each MEN type is associated with the occurrence of specific tumors. Thus, MEN1 is characterized by the occurrence of parathyroid, pancreatic islet and anterior pituitary tumors; MEN2 is characterized by the occurrence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in association with phaeochromocytoma and parathyroid tumors; MEN3 is characterized by the occurrence of MTC and phaeochromocytoma in association with a marfanoid habitus, mucosal neuromas, medullated corneal fibers and intestinal autonomic ganglion dysfunction, leading to megacolon; and MEN4, which is also referred to as MENX, is characterized by the occurrence of parathyroid and anterior pituitary tumors in possible association with tumors of the adrenals, kidneys, and reproductive organs. This review will focus on the clinical and molecular details of the MEN1 and MEN4 syndromes. The gene causing MEN1 is located on chromosome 11q13, and encodes a 610 amino-acid protein, menin, which has functions in cell division, genome stability, and transcription regulation. Menin, which acts as scaffold protein, may increase or decrease gene expression by epigenetic regulation of gene expression via histone methylation. Thus, menin by forming a subunit of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) complexes that trimethylate histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), facilitates activation of transcriptional activity in target genes such as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors; and by interacting with the suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog family protein (SUV39H1) to mediate H3K methylation, thereby silencing transcriptional activity of target genes. MEN1-associated tumors harbor germline and somatic mutations, consistent with Knudson's two-hit hypothesis. Genetic diagnosis to identify individuals with germline MEN1 mutations has facilitated appropriate targeting of clinical, biochemical and radiological screening for this high risk group of patients for whom earlier implementation of treatments can then be considered. MEN4 is caused by heterozygous mutations of CDNK1B which encodes the 196 amino-acid CDK1 p27Kip1, which is activated by H3K4 methylation. ",

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy identifies the childhood thyroid nodules that are at greatest risk for cancer. It should be noted, however, that approximately 2% of aspirates are falsely negative.

The evaluation and management of MEN2-related tumours is often different from that of sporadic counterparts. This review article provides an overview of clinical manifestations, diagnosis and surgical management of MEN2 patients. This review also presents applications of the most up-to-date imaging modalities to MEN2 patients that are tightly linked to the clinical management and aims to guide physicians towards a rationale for the use of imaging prior to prophylactic thyroidectomy, initial surgery and reoperations for persistent/recurrent disease. This review also concludes that, in the near future, it is expected that these patients will indeed benefit from newly developed positron emission tomography approaches which will target peptide receptors and protein kinases. Identification of MEN2-specific radiopharmaceuticals will also soon arise from molecular profiling studies. Furthermore, subtotal (cortical-sparing) adrenalectomy, which is a valid option in MEN2 for avoiding long-term steroid replacement, will benefit from an accurate estimation through imaging of differential adrenocortical function.

MEN 2A is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism; MEN 2B by medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma and characteristic stigmata. Activating germline mutations of the RET proto oncogene are responsible for this hereditary syndrome. Codon 634 mutations are the most common mutations occurring in MEN 2A families whereas a specific mutation at codon 918 is observed in the great majority of MEN 2B families. Analysis of these codons will provide a final diagnosis in the great majority of affected families making unnecessary further studies. To specifically study the codons 634 and 918 we used a minisequencing method as an alternative method to complete sequencing.;Using this mutation detection method we were able to reproduce in all cases, representative of 7 families, the information previously obtained by direct sequencing of PCR products. Depending on the number of primers used in the minisequencing reaction, we were able to interrogate either only one nucleotide of the target codon or the three nucleotides simultaneously.;This technique appears as a simple, rapid and efficient method for genetic screening of MEN 2 families. It can be utilized to seek for unknown mutations at specific codons or to screen for previously identified mutations and is therefore of interest to study index cases or individuals at risk. Results suggest that complete sequencing is unnecessary.",

The disease is caused by germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene. Subtypes of MEN 2 include MEN 2A, MEN 2B and familial MTC (FMTC) which differ in pattern of additional lesions or--in FMTC--lack of pheochromocytoma. In 2009, after extensive review of the literature, the guidelines of the American Thyroid Association made several recommendations regarding clinical and genetic diagnostic testing and treatment options. In this article, the recently published literature is reviewed and concerns regarding future perspectives are added. In particular, a critical handling of rare DNA variants and double mutations is necessary. Up to now, mutation-specific risk profiles and mutation-associated treatment recommendations are unavailable. We emphasise the need for approved centres for treatment of patients affected by MEN 2, not only adults but young children as well. As a high level of skill is required for endoscopic adrenal-sparing surgery, surgeons should declare their expertise before operating such patients.

This approach is often successful in early disease; however, treatment options for advanced endocrine malignancies remain unsatisfactory and prognosis is poor. In particular, cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy often show only limited and transient efficacy and are associated with significant toxicity. Thus, new treatment options are urgently needed. Advances in the understanding of the molecular pathology of endocrine malignancies has recently led to identification of key events in endocrine oncogenesis (e.g. oncogenic RET mutations in medullary thyroid carcinoma or RET/PTC rearrangements in papillary thyroid carcinoma). These new insights are increasingly matched by new compounds (e.g. tyrosine kinase inhibitors) targeting signaling pathways essential for tumor cell survival, proliferation and metastases. Accordingly, a rapidly growing number of preclinical investigations and early clinical trials in endocrine malignancies have been initiated. First results of \"targeted therapies\" in medullary and differentiated thyroid carcinoma are impressive: phase II trials targeting RET or VEGF receptor kinases led to objective tumor response in up to 50% of patients. This review covers these recent molecular and clinical advances which most likely will dramatically alter the treatment of endocrine malignancies within the coming decade.",

Moreover, it presents the authors' own findings. The familial medullary thyroid carcinoma burdened genealogy shows a new point mutation TCG(Ser)-->GCG(Ala) in codon 891, in the exon 15 of the protooncogene RET. This mutation was not detected in the chromosomes of healthy individuals. Analyzing the linkage with two known and two new polymorphic markers showed that there was a cisaggregation of informative polymorphic markers, phenotypic manifestation of the disease, and mutations in the genealogy in question. In the protooncogene RET, there were two new polymorphisms: G/A at position 24 in intron 14 and C/T in codon 836 (exon 14). The rate of the polymorphism encountered in codon 836 proved to be similar for the Russians and the Germans (0.96%), which was also seen for two earlier described polymorphisms in codon 691 (0.80 and 0.81, respectively) and in codon 904 (0.21 and 0.22). At the same time, there were statistically significant differences in the rates of intron 14 polymorphism (0.87 and 0.77, respectively). In a family having MEN 2, a proband displayed TGC-->CGC mutation in codon 634 of the gene RET in the heterozygous state. The mutation results in substitution of cysteine amino acid residue in the cysteine-rich extracellular domain of protein kinase encoded by the gene RET for arginine. The results of molecular analysis were used to confirm its clinical diagnosis and to indicate that effective care should be delivered in MEN 2a.",

Various molecular methods have been used to identify the different mutations, including DNA sequencing, restriction enzymatic analyses, chemical cleavage mismatch, Single Stranded Conformational Polymorphism [SSCP], and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis [DGGE]. These techniques, although useful and accurate, are labor intensive and some involve the use of radioactivity. We have developed a multiplex PCR assay simultaneously to amplify exons 10, 11, and 13 of the RET proto-oncogene. The multiplex PCR product is then analyzed on a modified Mutation Detection Enhancement [MDE] matrix for heteroduplex identification and visualized with ethidium bromide. Distinct heteroduplexes were detected for each known RET proto-oncogene mutation available in our laboratory (nine in exon 10, five in exon 11, one in exon 13, and the single exon 16 mutation). Presymptomatic DNA diagnosis of MEN 2 is essential since pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin studies can occasionally produce false positive results and lead to unnecessary thyroidectomies. Prophylactic thyroidectomy is recommended by age 5 or 6 once a mutation is identified in a patient, since penetrance is very high. MDE heteroduplex detection provides a quick, efficient, and inexpensive method of screening for RET mutations in MTC patients with unknown mutations, or for presymptomatic diagnosis in individuals at risk for inheriting a known RET mutation. Confirmation of the specific mutation can be achieved by restriction enzymatic digestion (if feasible) or by DNA sequencing.",

Neuroendocrine tumors (MEN1) are treated surgically and progressive disease is treated with somatostatin or everolimus.;The most important imaging methods for monitoring of MTC are sonography of the neck and upper abdomen and computed tomography (CT) of the lungs. In cases of MEN1 metastases can be localized by DOTATOC positron emission tomography CT (PET/CT).;Using these methods up to 70 % of tumors and metastases can be detected, depending on the localization, size and endocrine activity. Follow-up investigations with CT is an important tool for monitoring changes in tumor mass which are important criteria for decisions concerning TKI therapy.;Together with the doubling time of tumor markers, tumor progression monitored by imaging methods or response evaluation criteria In solid tumors (RECIST) are prognostic factors and provide indications for initiating systemic therapy (e.g.;Patients with MEN syndromes should be treated in specialized centers because of the complexity and rarity.",

Individuals with MEN 2B may develop megacolon and pseudo-obstruction due to intestinal ganglioneuromatosis simulating Hirschsprung's (HSCR) disease. We hereby describe the clinical and genetic features of a 21-year-old male patient with MEN 2B associated with pseudo-HSCR disease. The patient had MTC, pheochromocytoma, marfanoid habitus, multiple mucosal ganglioneuromas, thickened corneal nerves and severe gastrointestinal involvement. Emergent laparotomy was performed when he was presented with acute bowel obstruction. The myenteric and submucosal nerve plexuses in the small and large intestines were composed of diffusely hyperplasic, disorganized, mature ganglion cells. Genetic testing revealed a de novo ret proto-oncogene germline mutation in codon 918 in exon 16. Megacolon and pseudo-obstruction similar to the HSCR disease may develop in patients with MEN 2B. However, the observed dysmotility is the result of an abnormal proliferation of intramural ganglion cells in contrast to the absence of enteric ganglia which were present in the HSCR disease. Attentiveness about the phenotypic characteristics and unusual findings might lead to early and correct diagnosis of the MEN 2B syndrome. This approach improves the survival rate and quality of life considerably.",

This study aimed to describe the clinical presentation, oncological features, and treatment outcome of children and young adults harboring RET mutations followed at our institution from 1997 to 2007.;Forty-one individuals aged < or =25 years from 17 independent multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A kindred were studied.

        "Doc_abstract":"The association of the rare hereditary cancer syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2a (MEN 2a) with Hirschsprung's disease, both linked to germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene, has been reported recently. With the widespread availability of genetic screening for MEN 2a, it is necessary to define the indications for genetic testing of MEN 2a and population subgroups at high risk for inheriting the disease. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of Hirschsprung's disease in MEN 2a and investigate the value of genetic analysis for MEN 2a in children with familial Hirschsprung's disease.;The ethnically diverse study group consisted of unselected consecutive patients (n=426) at risk for hereditary medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) referred to a single laboratory for genetic testing. Analysis used genomic DNA and a polymerase chain reaction-based heteroduplex mutation detection strategy for exons 10, 11, 13, and 14 of the RET proto-oncogene followed by direct DNA sequencing. Significance of RET genotype-phenotype correlation was determined by Fisher's two-tailed Exact test and a 2 x 2 contingency table.;Thirty-six distinctly new MEN 2a kindreds were identified. Hirschsprung's disease cosegregated among siblings with MEN 2a in 15 patients from 6 of the 36 (17%) families. The extent of aganglionosis in the 15 patients ranged from midrectum to duodenum. Of the 15 patients with Hirschsprung's disease, 10 (six boys, four girls) underwent thyroidectomy for MTC (n=5) or C-cell hyperplasia (n = 5) at ages 2 to 47 years (mean, 15.6 years), and the remaining five patients died in childhood of complications related to the aganglionosis. In retrospect, Hirschsprung's disease was the presenting feature of MEN 2a in five of the six families rather than MTC or pheochromocytoma. In all six MEN 2a families expressing Hirschsprung's disease, the RET mutation predisposing to the combined phenotype occurred in exon 10 at codons 609 (n=2), 618 (n=3), or 620 (n = 1). By contrast, the MEN 2a with Hirschsprung's phenotype was not found in any of the 22 families with a RETexon 11, 13, or 14 mutation (P=.0007).;The authors conclude that Hirschsprung's disease is a phenotypic marker for MEN 2a and possibly more common than originally appreciated. The expression of Hirschsprung's disease with MEN 2a may be uniquely linked to RETexon 10 mutations. The authors recommend that (1) patients affected with MEN 2a may be counseled regarding the potential risk of Hirschsprung's disease in offspring and (2) a family history of MTC be explored in children with familial Hirschsprung's disease and genetic screening for MEN 2a be considered.",

Cytologic evaluation facilitates the diagnosis of thyroid lesions (TLs), but in 10-40% of cases the interpretation is indeterminate. Patients with indeterminate diagnoses are often treated with hemithyroidectomy followed by completion thyroidectomy, if cancer is found in the initial specimen. Exposing patients to multiple surgeries increases costs and morbidity. The American Thyroid Association states that a combination of molecular markers is likely to optimize the management of patients with indeterminate cytology. However, few studies have addressed the molecular alterations present in pediatric TL. Twenty-seven thyroid carcinomas from patients 10 to 19 years of age were tested for alterations common in adult TL, including BRAF V600E mutation, RET fusions, and TERT promoter mutations. Mutation-negative cases were subsequently analyzed with a next-generation sequencing (NGS) mutation panel to search for additional targets. Histologic diagnoses included 12 classic papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), 13 follicular variant PTCs, 1 medullary thyroid carcinoma, and 1 follicular carcinoma. Fourteen cases showed lymph node involvement, and 13 cases demonstrated lymphovascular invasion. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 10/27 cases, and RET fusions were detected in 6/27 cases. No TERT promoter mutations were identified in any of the cases. The NGS panel revealed additional RET and CTNNB1 pathogenic missense mutations. Our results demonstrate that molecular abnormalities are common in pediatric TLs and suggest that incorporation of molecular testing will be helpful in optimizing patient management. ",

On objective disease progression, patients could elect to receive open-label vandetanib. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS), determined by independent central Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) assessments.;Between December 2006 and November 2007, 331 patients (mean age, 52 years; 90% sporadic; 95% metastatic) were randomly assigned to receive vandetanib (231) or placebo (100).

Ultrasonography (US) and US-guided biopsy remain cornerstones in the initial workup of thyroid cancer. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment, with radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy reserved for differentiated subtypes. Posttreatment surveillance of thyroid cancer is done with US of the thyroid bed as well as monitoring of tumor markers such as serum thyroglobulin and serum calcitonin. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT are used in the follow-up of patients with negative iodine 131 imaging and elevated tumor markers. Certain mutations, such as mutations of BRAF in papillary thyroid carcinoma and mutations in RET codons 883, 918, and 928, are associated with an aggressive course in medullary thyroid carcinoma, and affected patients need close surveillance. Treatment options for metastatic RAI-refractory thyroid cancer are limited. Currently, Food and Drug Administration-approved molecularly targeted therapies for metastatic RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, including sorafenib, lenvatinib, vandetanib, and cabozantinib, target the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and RET kinases. Imaging plays an important role in assessment of response to these therapies, which can be atypical owing to antiangiogenic effects. A wide spectrum of toxic effects is associated with the molecularly targeted therapies used in thyroid cancer and can be detected at restaging scans. (©)RSNA, 2016. ",

Missense mutations in one of six cysteine codons in the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of the RET proto-oncogene predispose to this disease. These mutations cause ligand-independent constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor by the formation of disulfide-bonded homodimers. We examined a different type of mutation, which results in an additional cysteine in the cysteine rich domain. A duplication of 9 bp in the first case resulted in an insertion of three amino acids between codon 633 and 634. In the second case a 12 bp duplication in exon 11 results in four additional amino acids between codon 634 and 635. Here we demonstrate that an additional cysteine causes a ligand independent dimerization of the RET receptor in transfected NIH3T3 cells, which results in an activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase.",

Prophylactic thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with RET gene mutations. The age at which patients undergo prophylactic thyroidectomy may vary depending on the position of the RET gene codon. In cases of MEN 2B, when the mutation is carried in codons 883, 918 or 922, prophylactic thyroidectomy is performed prior to 6 months of age, due to the increased aggressiveness of these heterozygosities, which are capable of determining the onset of medullary cancer during the first months of life. We present two heterozygous twin patients with MEN 2B syndrome who were born 32 weeks premature, and who underwent prophylactic thyroidectomy at 7 months of age. The patients were carriers of the mutation at codon 918. We suggested the early surgery at 7 months as, due to their prematurity, the patients were required to gain weight to improve their condition prior to surgery. The two patients had medullary thyroid carcinoma without lymph node involvement.

The shift toward earlier thyroidectomy has resulted in significantly less medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)-related morbidity and mortality. However, very young pediatric patients might have a higher morbidity rate compared with older patients. Hardly any literature exists on complications in the very young. A retrospective single-center analysis was performed on the outcomes of MEN2 patients undergoing a prophylactic total thyroidectomy at the age of 17 or younger. Forty-one MEN2A and 3 MEN2B patients with thyroidectomy after January 1993 and at least 6 months of follow-up were included, subdivided in 9 patients younger than 3 years, 15 patients 3 to 6 years, and 20 patients older than 6 years. Postoperative hypocalcemia and other complications were registered. Twelve (27%) patients developed transient hypocalcemia and 9 (20%) patients suffered from permanent hypocalcemia, with a nonsignificant trend toward higher incidence with decreasing age. Three (7%) patients had other complications, of whom 2 were younger than 3 years. For patients younger than 3 years, the average length of stay (LOS) was 6.7 days, versus 1.7 and 3.5 days, respectively, for the older patient groups (P < 0.05). Patients with complications had a longer LOS compared with patients without (5.0 vs 2.0, P < 0.01). None of the patients had clinical signs of recurrent MTC after a mean follow-up of 10.5 years. Prophylactic thyroidectomy in very young children is associated with a higher rate of complications, causing a significant increased LOS. Irrespective age of surgery, MTC did not recur in any patient. In planning optimal timing of surgery, clinicians should take the risk of complications into account. We advise not to perform total thyroidectomy before the age of 3 for patients defined high risk by the American Thyroid Association guideline.",

One case of persistent left recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis was observed (1.1%) despite intraoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring. Eight cases of immediate postoperative hypocalcaemia were observed (23.5% of the 34 total thyroidectomies) and permanent hypocalcaemia was observed in 5 cases (14.7%) with a significantly lower immediate postoperative serum calcium than in the case of transient hypocalcaemia (P=0.035).

Concise examination of the mutated codons led to the detection of a striking genotype-phenotype correlation between the mutated codon and the MEN 2 phenotype in terms of onset and aggressiveness of the disease, suggesting that manifestation and clinical progression is conditioned by the type of mutation. To gain insight into the molecular basis for this genotype-phenotype correlation, we analysed the impact of common and rare mutations identified in MEN 2A (C609Y, C634R), MEN 2B (A883F, M918T) and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (Y791F) patients on several aspects of cell transformation, including proliferation, apoptosis, anchorage-independent growth and signaling. We found that tumor cells arising from distinct extracellular or intracellular MEN 2 mutations clearly differ in their proliferation properties owing to the activation of different molecular pathways, but importantly, also in resistance to apoptosis. Whereas MEN 2A mutants resulted in accelerated cell proliferation, MEN 2B-RET mutants significantly enhanced suppression of apoptosis, which may account, at least partially, for some of the clinical differences in MEN 2 patients.",

MEN-1 is a major form of hyperparathyroidism associated with a high prevalence of endocrine tumours of the pancreas, pituitary gland, adrenal cortex and the lymphoid and bronchial endocrine tissues. MEN-2 is the familial syndrome of medullary thyroid carcinoma, associated with pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism. Apart from the clinical expression of their allelic variants, both syndromes are different in their physiopathogenesis, in that MEN-2 is related to the constitutional activation of the proto-oncogene RET that encodes a putative tyrosine kinase receptor, while MEN-1 is a tumour suppressor gene model, related to mutations in the menin adapter-protein of multiple intracellular functions. The study of other rarer forms of predisposition to endocrine tumours, and especially to hyperparathyroidism, has uncovered new genes such as HRPT2, which show that multiple physiological routes, including the close regulation of transcription and genetic stability, may lead to the same clinical outcome. These hereditary models of endocrine cancer contribute as much to further physiopathogenic knowledge as to the therapeutic recommendations for managing these syndromes.",

Many possible causes of multiple malignancies have been reported such as genetic alterations, exposure to anti-cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy and reduced immunologic response. We report a female patient with multiple sclerosis and quadruple cancers of different embryological origin. Patient was diagnosed with stage III (T3, N1a, MO) medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), multicentric micropapillary thyroid carcinoma, scapular and lumbar melanomas (Clark II, Breslow II), and lobular invasive breast carcinoma (T1a, NO, MO). All tumors present in our patient except micropapillary thyroid carcinomas were investigated for gene alterations known to have a key role in cancer promotion and progression. Tumor samples were screened for the p16 alterations (loss of heterozygosity and homozygous deletions), loss of heterozygosity of PTEN, p53 alterations (mutational status and loss of heterozygosity) and mutational status of RET, HRAS and KRAS. Each type of tumor investigated had specific pattern of analyzed genetic alterations. The most prominent genetic changes were mutual alterations in PTEN and p53 tumor suppressors present in breast cancer and two melanomas. These co-alterations could be crucial for promoting development of multiple malignancies. Moreover the insertion in 4(th) codon of HRAS gene was common for all tumor types investigated. It represents frameshift mutation introducing stop codon at position 5 which prevents synthesis of a full-length protein. Since the inactivated RAS enhances sensitivity to tamoxifen and radiotherapy this genetic alteration could be considered as a good prognostic factor for this patient. ",

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) associates primary hyperparathyroidism, lesions of the endocrine pancreas and pituitary adenomas. The first hint that the MEN1 gene is localized on chromosome 11 came from the finding of allele losses in MEN1 associated tumours. Subsequent genetic linkage analysis to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers assigned the gene to chromosome band 11q13. MEN2A is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma and phaeochromocytoma. The disease locus was localized to the centromeric region of chromosome 10 by genetic linkage. For both syndromes genetic linkage maps of the flanking regions have been established, and a set of RFLP markers is now available for premorbid identification of gene carriers in affected families. Analysis of allele losses showed that tumorigenesis of parathyroid and pancreatic lesions results from unmasking of a recessive mutation at the MEN1 locus, and by deletion mapping the tentative MEN1 region was restricted to a few million base pairs. In contrast, such losses appear to be relatively rare in MEN2A associated lesions.",

Although this disorder is classified as a rare disease, the patients affected have a low life quality and a very expensive and continuous treatment. At present, MEN2A is diagnosed by gene sequencing after birth, thus trying to start an early treatment and by reduction of morbidity and mortality. We first evaluated the presence of MEN2A mutation (C634Y) in serum of 25 patients, previously diagnosed by sequencing in peripheral blood leucocytes, using HRM genotyping analysis. In a second step, we used a COLD-PCR approach followed by HRM genotyping analysis for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of a pregnant woman carrying a fetus with a C634Y mutation. HRM analysis revealed differences in melting curve shapes that correlated with patients diagnosed for MEN2A by gene sequencing analysis with 100% accuracy. Moreover, the pregnant woman carrying the fetus with the C634Y mutation revealed a melting curve shape in agreement with the positive controls in the COLD-PCR study. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing of the COLD-PCR amplification product. In conclusion, we have established a HRM analysis in serum samples as a new primary diagnosis method suitable for the detection of C634Y mutations in MEN2A patients.

Both of them originate from neural crest cells and share similar mechanisms of tumor development. The same genetic alteration may predispose to the development of sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglioma. The best known hereditary forms of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are the von Hippel-Lindau disease, in which pheochromocytoma may be associated with CNS hemangioblastoma, retinal angioma, pancreatic endocrine tumor/cysts and renal clear cell carcinoma/cysts; the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, in which pheochromocytoma is associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma and primary hyperparathyroidism, Type 1 neurofibromatosis, the most frequent hereditary cancer syndrome. Finally, it has been characterized the paraganglioma syndrome in which sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglioma are variously associated. The list of predisposing gene is quite long and comprises VHL, RET, NF1, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2. More rarely, two other genes may predispose to pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma development: KIF1Bbeta and PHD2. A mechanism conducing to a defective apoptosis is the common pathways of those genes.

Most of these tumors are sporadic and the genetic alterations responsible for their genesis take place over several cell generations; nevertheless, 5 to 10% of the human tumors are hereditary, with a rapid development. Cancer susceptibility genes have been classified as \"gatekeepers\" (e.g. RB1, ki-ras) and \"caretakers\" (e.g. hMLH1 and hMSH2, BRCA1). The first step in identifying individuals at high risk of developing a specific inherited form of cancer, and who should therefore undergo genetic tests, is the detailed construction of family history (an accurate cancer family history that includes at least three generation pedigrees, an appropriate cancer risk assessment and an effective genetic counseling). At present, the most useful methods of risk assessment are those performed on the following genes: BRCA1 and BRCA2 especially for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, hMLH1 and hMSH2 for hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer, APC for familial adenomatous polyposis, ret for medullary thyroid carcinoma, p53 for the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, p16 for melanoma and RB1 for retinoblastoma.

Exons 8, 10, 11, and 13-16 were screened.;A total of 58 individuals (30.85%) were RET mutations carriers, 120 (63.8%) were finally classified as sporadic, 13 apparently sporadic cases (9.8%) were identified with RET mutation: ten carried the exon 8 at codon 533 mutation (previously reported), two the exon 14 at codon 804 mutation, and one the exon 13 at codon 768 mutation. Six patients (3.19%) with clinical features of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A and negative for RET mutations were classified as 'unknown cause'. The mutations of hereditary cases were as follows: 21 cases (36.2%) in exon 8 codon 533, 19 (32.8%) in exon 11 codon 634, nine (15.5%) in exon 10, five (8.6%) in exon 16, three (5.2%) in exon 14 codon 804, and one in exon 13 codon 768 (1.7%).;The spectrum of RET mutations in Greece differs from that in other populations and the prevalence of familial cases is higher. The exon 8 (Gly533Cys) mutation was the most prevalent in familial cases unlike other series, followed by exon 11 (codon 634) mutations which are the most frequent elsewhere. The wide application of genetic screening in MTC reveals new molecular defects and helps to characterize the spectrum of mutations in each ethnic group.",

MEN-2A, MEN-2B, and familial medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) comprise the MEN-2 syndrome. A germline mutation in the RET proto-oncogene is responsible for the MEN-2 syndrome. Recent data indicate that in 99% of MEN-2 cases, a germline RET mutation can be identified by genetic testing. The phenotypic variation of MEN-2 is diverse and partly related to the codon and specific point mutation in the RET proto-oncogene. There are increasing data on the genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with MEN-2 and this information should be used for screening at-risk patients and treatment of RET mutation carriers. All patients (especially if young) with MTC or bilateral pheochromocytoma should have a careful family history taken and genetic screening for RET germline mutations. Patients who are RET germline mutation carriers but without clinical or biochemical evidence of MTC should have a prophylactic total thyroidectomy. The optimal age of thyroidectomy should be based on the RET genotype (eg, high-risk mutations within the first year of life, intermediate-risk mutations by 5 years of age, and low-risk mutations by 10 years of age). Patients who are diagnosed with clinical or biochemical evidence of MTC should have a total or a near total thyroidectomy and at least a central neck lymph node dissection. Patients who have pheochromocytoma and a unilateral adrenal tumor on a localizing study should have a unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy after preoperative alpha-blockade. However, patients with bilateral adrenal tumors on localizing studies should have bilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy. A cortical-sparing (subtotal) adrenalectomy may be considered, if technically feasible, to avoid long-term steroid dependence and to reduce the risk of Addisonian crisis. Patients with biochemical evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism should have a bilateral neck exploration and total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation (30-60 mg of the most normal parathyroid tissue) to the nondominant forearm if asymmetric parathyroid hyperplasia is present. Rarely, patients may have only single-gland disease and excision may be performed if the other parathyroid glands are not found with biopsy to be hyperplastic. All unresected parathyroid glands should be marked with a clip because patients with MEN-2A have a high risk of persistent and recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism. Patients with familial MTC may have not manifested the other features of MEN-2A, thus these patients should have continued follow-up for pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism.",

Genetic testing was performed in the relatives of patients with familial MTC in order to distinguish asymptomatic mutation carriers from noncarriers.;RET gene mutations were identified in 46 patients (22%). The others were found noncarriers and sporadic MTC was diagnosed. MEN 2A/FMTC syndrome (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A/ familial type of MTC) was diagnosed in 44 patients, MEN 2B syndrome (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B) in 2 patients. In patients with sporadic and familial MTC, age at diagnosis and multifocal occurrence was analysed, and the results were found to be in accordance with those of other research centres. However, the distribution and frequency of mutations, as well as some clinical data, such as the frequency of pheochromocytoma occurrence as the first manifestation of MEN syndrome, differed from the published data, and further studies are necessary to reveal the reasons of these differences.;DNA testing for RET gene mutations is reliable as a diagnostic tool and therefore it should be performed for screening of all patients with MTC or other diseases of MEN syndrome.",

While such tyrosine kinase inhibitors, particularly those affecting RET activity such as vandetanib, sorafenib and sunitinib, are promising, the low rate of partial responses and absence of complete responses in all of the various trials of monotherapy emphasize the need for new and more effective single agents or combinations of therapeutic agents with acceptable toxicity.",

Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a neuroendocrine tumor developing from the C cells of the thyroid. Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are involved in the pathogenesis of several forms of MTC. The deregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway seems to contribute to the tumorigenic activity of RET proto-oncogene mutations. Targeting this pathway through specific inhibitors at simple or multiple sites may represent an attractive potential therapeutic approach for patients with advanced MTCs. The aim of this review is to examine the role of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in the development and progression of MTC and the new therapeutic options that target this signaling pathway. ",

Classically patients with a pheochromocytoma initially present with the triad of paroxysmal headaches, palpitations, and diaphoresis accompanied by marked hypertension. However, although reported as a rare presentation, spontaneous hemorrhage within a pheochromocytoma can present as an abdominal catastrophe. Unrecognized, this transformation can rapidly result in death. We report the only documented case of a thirty eight year old gentleman with MEN2A who presented to a community hospital with hemorrhagic shock and peritonitis secondary to an unrecognized hemorrhagic pheochromocytoma. The clinical course is notable for an inability to localize the source of hemorrhage during an initial damage control laparotomy that stabilized the patient sufficiently to allow emergent transfer to our facility, re-exploration for continued hemorrhage and abdominal compartment syndrome, and ultimately angiographic embolization of the left adrenal artery for control of the bleeding. Following recovery from his critical illness and appropriate medical management for pheochromocytoma, he returned for interval bilateral adrenal gland resection, from which his recovery was unremarkable. Our review of the literature highlights the high mortality associated with the undertaking of an operative intervention in the face of an unrecognized functional pheochromocytoma. This reinforces the need for maintaining a high index of suspicion for pheochromocytoma in similar cases. Our case also demonstrates the need for a mutimodal treatment approach that will often be required in these cases.",

From a surgical point of view, compartment-oriented lymph node dissection, clearing gross, and occult metastases are important for locoregional tumor control.

The syndromes are characterized by benign and malignant changes in two or more endocrine organs, as well as incidental changes in nervous, muscular and connective tissue. Two main forms can be distinguished: the MEN-I syndrome with hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland, accompanied by islet cell tumor and pituitary adenoma; the MEN-II syndrome with medullary thyroid carcinoma in combination with bilateral pheochromocytoma and hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland (MEN IIa), while type IIb is characterized by the additional appearance of neurocutaneous manifestations without primary hyperparathyroidism. Characteristics shared by these syndromes include the involved cell type, most of the tumors are composed of one or more specific polypeptide- and biogenic amine-producing cell types (APUD--amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation). The second characteristic is the increased incidence in certain families. The hereditary component is autosomal dominant with variable expression but high penetrance. Mechanisms of tumorigenesis differ in these syndromes. While MEN I is caused by an inherited mutation of a tumor suppressor gene, menin, located on the long arm of chromosome 11, MEN II is caused by activation of the RET proto-oncogene. We have reported the case of a young man exhibiting bilateral pheochromocytoma. In addition, the patient showed mild primary hyperparathyroidism and marfanoid habitus, all these stigmata usually being part of the MEN-II syndrome. Although this described patient showed a phenotypic mixture of the MEN-IIa and MEN-IIb syndrome, the genetic analysis for MEN II and von-Hippel-Lindau gene did not reveal any pathologic mutations, the endocrine disorders described here are not related to multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.",

The genes implicated can be broadly categorized as oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes. The RET oncogene has well established roles in the development of both papillary (PTC) and medullary (MTC) thyroid carcinoma. Genetic screening for germline RET mutations in members of multiple endocrine neoplasia type II (MEN-II) families is now widely performed, and prophylactic thyroidectomy in gene carriers is advisable at an early age. Patients with apparently sporadic MTC can also be screened to rule out familial disease. The demonstration of a RET rearrangement in a patient's PTC may have prognostic significance, but as yet there are no management implications. The thyrotropin receptor (TSH-R) and Gsalpha become oncogenic through point mutation and are associated with the development of toxic thyroid adenomas. The ras oncogene is implicated in the early stages of development of several thyroid tumor types. Tumor-suppressor genes also have a role in thyroid tumor formation. The p53 gene appears to be involved in the process of transformation to the anaplastic phenotype and the PTEN gene in the development of follicular adenomas but not carcinomas. There is still limited evidence for the so called adenoma-carcinoma sequence of the thyroid follicular cell. Loss of heterozygosity studies have enabled identification of tumor-suppressor genes, and their findings suggests differences in the pathogenesis of PTCs compared with follicular cancers. Surgical decision-making will benefit from these basic molecular advances, which rapidly translates into improved patient management.",

Complete total thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for PTC, FTC, and MTC. Radioiodine is routinely recommended in high-risk patients and considered in intermediate risk DTC patients. DTC cancer cells, during tumor progression, may lose the iodide uptake ability, becoming resistant to radioiodine, with a significant worsening of the prognosis. The lack of specific and effective drugs for aggressive and metastatic DTC and MTC leads to additional efforts toward the development of new drugs. Several genetic alterations in different molecular pathways in TC have been shown in the past few decades, associated with TC development and progression. Rearranged during transfection (RET)/PTC gene rearrangements, RET mutations, BRAF mutations, RAS mutations, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 angiogenesis pathways are some of the known pathways determinant in the development of TC. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are small organic compounds inhibiting tyrosine kinases auto-phosphorylation and activation, most of them are multikinase inhibitors. TKIs act on the aforementioned molecular pathways involved in growth, angiogenesis, local, and distant spread of TC. TKIs are emerging as new therapies of aggressive TC, including DTC, MTC, and anaplastic thyroid cancer, being capable of inducing clinical responses and stabilization of disease. Vandetanib and cabozantinib have been approved for the treatment of MTC, while sorafenib and lenvatinib for DTC refractory to radioiodine. These drugs prolong median progression-free survival, but until now no significant increase has been observed on overall survival; side effects are common.

When no mutation is observed, a linkage analysis study may be proposed. (2) In the subjects at risk, early screening for the various types of endocrine lesions may then start in childhood and be performed using specific biological markers of MTC, pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism, and particularly, basal and pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin measurement, which is known to be the most sensitive marker for the monitoring of MTC. (3) This step of biological investigations enables the earliest possible treatment of any endocrine lesion detected before it is expressed clinically, thus improving the prognosis of MEN-2.

However, surgery has not been invariable but has continued to change in accordance with research results. In benign cases, surgery has generally evolved to be as organ preserving as possible. In several instances, however, a more radical extent of resection seems justified in order to ensure that the risk of recurrence is as low as possible. For instance, total thyroidectomy may be beneficial in patients with endemic multinodular goitre or young patients with Graves' disease and accompanying cold nodules or high levels of autoantibodies. Several tools, e.g. magnifying glasses, bipolar coagulation forceps and neuromonitoring, are available to identify and preserve the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the parathyroid glands, hence keeping the morbidity at a low level. Most recently, minimally invasive surgery has been successfully used in treating both benign and malignant disorders of the thyroid gland. In the case of malignant disorders, minimally invasive surgery may become an attractive alternative to open surgery if a limited surgical extent is justified, e.g. in patients with micro-PTC (papillary thyroid carcinoma, diameter less than 1 cm). Whether a limited surgical approach is also justified in other cases, e.g. in any patient with intrathyroidal PTC or patients with micro-FTC (follicular thyroid carcinoma), remains to be shown and is the subject of ongoing investigations. One of the most intriguing recent discoveries is the identification of genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma. In these patients, the timing and extent of surgery may depend not only on the patient's age and serum levels of the tumour marker calcitonin but also on the specific germline RET proto-oncogene mutation. Surgery will certainly continue to play an important role in the treatment of thyroid diseases and may be increasingly based on individual findings instead of general recommendations.",

External beam radiation therapy is reserved for adjuvant treatment of MTC with aggressive features. Targeted therapeutics vandetanib and cabozantinib are approved for the treatment of aggressive and metastatic tumors that are not amenable to surgery. The use of these multikinase inhibitors are supported by the observed overactivation of the RET oncoprotein in a large subpopulation of MTCs. However, not all patients carry oncogenic alterations of this kinase. Hence, there is still a need for comprehensive molecular characterization of MTC utilizing whole-genome and transcriptome-sequencing methodologies with the aim of identifying targetable mutations. Here, we describe the genomic profiles of two medullary thyroid cancers and report the presence of a putative oncogenic BRAF fusion in one. Such alterations, previously observed in other malignancies and known targets of available drugs, can benefit patients who currently have no treatment options. ",

In patients with MNG, sCT levels >50 pg/ml were associated with CCH or MTC, being the total number of C-cells/60 fields significantly higher than that found in MNG with normal bCT (P = 0.0008) and comparable with that detected in FMTCs. In the group with sCT>50 pg/ml, the C-cells displayed a neoplastic phenotype. Neither germline nor somatic RET mutations were found. In conclusion, sCT levels >50 pg/ml were always associated with CCH, without correlation between CT levels and the number of C-cells or the final diagnosis.

Cell counts were performed with a Coulter counter or by flow cytometry. DNA synthesis was evaluated by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. A cell death ELISA was used to assess apoptosis. Akt phosphorylation was determined by Western immunoblot. MAPK activity was measured using an immunoprecipitation kinase assay, and MAPK inhibition was achieved with SB202190 (p38 MAPK) and PD098059 (MAPK kinase). Data were analyzed by ANOVA. Compared with controls, PP2 reduced DNA synthesis, abolished Akt phosphorylation, and increased apoptosis. The MAPK kinase inhibitor, PD098059, attenuated DNA synthesis, whereas genistein caused modest declines in cell count and DNA synthesis and minimal changes in apoptosis. We conclude that Src-dependent MTC proliferation occurs via increased DNA synthesis and reduced apoptosis. The latter effect may be mediated by Akt survival signals.

        "Doc_abstract":"Individuals with inherited cancer syndromes are at significant risk of developing both benign and malignant tumours as a result of a germline mutation in a specific tumour suppressor gene. Tumours of familial origin are a rare event in the head and neck but despite this, they deserve a growing interest. Familial paragangliomas are most of the time limited to the paraganglionar system, but also may be part of different syndromic associations. Since early detection of paragangliomas reduces the incidence of morbidity and mortality, genotypic analysis in the search of SDHB, SDHC and SDHD mutations in families of affected patients plays a front-line diagnostic role, leading to more efficient patient management. Multiple endocrine neoplasias type 1 are characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of at least two of the three main related endocrine tumours: parathyroid, enteropancreatic and anterior pituitary. These tumours arise from inactivating germline mutations in the MEN-1 gene. No clear correlation of MEN-1 genotype with genotype has emerged to date, and MEN-1 mutation testing in tumours is not used clinically because it have not implications for tumour staging. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is due to a germline mutation in the RET proto-oncogene. Hallmarks of MEN-2A (the commonest phenotypic variant) include medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism. The most central clinical difference with MEN-1 is that the associated cancer can be prevented or cured by early thyroidectomy in mutation carriers. Individuals with neurofibomatosis type 1 present early in life with pigmentary abnormalities, skinfold freckling and iris hamartomas, as result of NF1 gene mutation. Neurofibromatosis 2 is caused by inactivating mutations of the NF2 gene, and is characterized by the development of nervous system tumours (mainly bilateral vestibular schwannomas), ocular abnormalities, and skin tumours. The molecular genetic basis of nasopharyngeal carcinomas remains unknown, but there is evidence for the linkage of these tumours to chromosome 3p. Finally, the high rate of p16 mutations in squamous cell carcinomas and the association of p16 with familial melanoma propose p16 as an ideal candidate gene predisposing to familial squamous cell carcinomas. The elucidation of the cellular processes affected by dysfunction in familial tumours of the head and neck may serve to identify potential targets for future therapeutic interventions.",

This was confirmed in a surgical series of 58 patients (34 with preoperatively normal and 24 with elevated serum calcitonin) where no calcitonin-positive cells were demonstrable immunohistochemically within separately investigated isthmi. Consequently, isthmus-preserving total bilateral lobectomy (IPTB) may be regarded as an adequate surgical procedure for C-cell hyperplasia (CCH).;IPTB was performed from October 2001 to December 2004 in 64 patients, 59 patients with nodular goiter and slightly to moderately elevated serum calcitonin (stimulated under 500 pg/ml) (group A, apparently sporadic cases) and in 5 patients undergoing prophylactic surgery for hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with intermediate- or low-risk RET mutations (non-634) (group B). The surgical procedure focused on meticulous total extracapsular resection of both thyroid lobes, preservation of an isthmus remnant of about 3 ml (smaller in children), and histologic workup of the border zones of resection in addition to that of the completely removed lobes. When malignancy could be proven intraoperatively (7 patients) or when the isthmus turned out to contain nodular lesions (4 patients), completion total thyroidectomy (plus lymphadenectomy) was performed as a one-stage procedure. Second-stage total thyroidectomy was performed in 3 cases. Thus, IPTB was the definitive surgical procedure in 50 patients (45 of group A and all 5 of group B).;In all of the 50 definite IPTB cases, postoperative serum calcitonin was below the measurable limit (2 pg/ml); stimulated calcitonin was below the measurable limit in 47 (including all of group B) and was measurable in 3 sporadic cases in a lower-normal range between 2.4 and 3.5 pg/ml. Genetic screening of the apparently sporadic cases with CCH was positive in one (codon 791). The risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis seems not to be elevated (0% permanent); permanent hypocalcemia occurred in 1 patient (2%). Follow-up data of 37 patients, median 18 (6-36) months, showed continuously nonmeasurable serum calcitonin with one exception, where it was in the normal range after 18 months. All IPTB patients are still under substitution therapy with L-thyroxine (median 125 mug/day) with decreasing tendency in all 3 children after prophylactic operation, the latter also showing an increasing volume of well-vascularized isthmi (from 1.5 to 2.5 ml).;IPTB reliably removes all C cells. There may not be need for total thyroidectomy (TTx) in cases with CCH. When necessary, completion TTx can be performed easily without additional risk. IPTB leaves a functionally relevant remnant, corresponding to that of a subtotal resection. This might be of importance especially for prophylactic surgery in children where the isthmus can compensate for the loss of thyroid function with time.",

CEP-751 induced a loss in the induction of the DNA repair program marked by phospho-H2AX and the checkpoint pathway marked by the activated Chk1 pathway.;Irinotecan treatment was highly effective in a preclinical model of human MTC, resulting in complete remission in 100% of the xenografts treated. The duration of remission was further enhanced by combination with the kinase inhibitor, CEP-751. These results suggest that irinotecan, alone or in combination, may be useful for the treatment of MTC.",

Recent advances in better understanding the pathogenesis and altered signaling pathways-especially in medullary and differentiated thyroid cancers (MTCs and DTCs)-have begun to change this situation substantially. Vandetanib, an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the RET kinase that is constitutively activated in MTC, has now been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in progressive and symptomatic metastatic MTC; it has been shown to delay time to progression relative to placebo in a randomized phase III trial. Further, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF-R) inhibitory agents including sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, and axitinib that are already approved in the United States for use in advanced renal cell carcinoma have shown high response rates in treating advanced DTCs in multiple phase II trials, and have become commonly used in progressive radioiodine-refractory metastatic DTC. Yet additional agents are now in development, with several including XL184 (cabozantinib) also showing promise in DTC and MTC. In anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), progress has been slower, with the greatest apparent gains resulting more from the application of systemic therapies earlier in the disease course, especially when used in conjunction with initial surgical and radiation therapies. Despite recent progress, additional effective systemic therapeutic approaches remain sorely needed for treating metastatic MTC, DTC, and ATC. ",

Patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics were recorded, and variables predictive of CSM were identified by univariable analyses. A multivariable competing risk model was then built to predict the 10-year cancer specific mortality of MTC. All predictors of interest were added in the starting full model before selection, including age, gender, pre- and postoperative serum calcitonin, pre- and postoperative CEA, RET mutation status, perivascular invasion, margin status, pathologic T status, pathologic N status, and M status. Stepdown method was used in model selection to choose predictive variables.;Of 249 MTC patients, 22.5 % (56/249) died from MTC, whereas 6.4 % (16/249) died secondary to other causes.

The seven variables with the highest predictive accuracy for cancer specific mortality included age, gender, postoperative calcitonin, perivascular invasion, pathologic T status, pathologic N status, and M status. These variables were used to create the final nomogram.

To explore genetic profiles of MTCs, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from MTC patients were assayed on the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2. Eighty-four sporadic MTC samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues were successfully sequenced. We discovered 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes in the 84 MTC tissue samples. The most common mutation was in the ret proto-oncogene, which occurred in 47 cases followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (N = 14), serine/threonine kinase 11 (N = 11), v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (N = 6), mutL homolog 1 (N = 4), Kiesten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (N = 3) and MET proto-oncogene (N = 3). We also evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Two of 98 screened cases were positive for ALK FISH. To identify the genomic breakpoint and 5' fusion partner of ALK, customized targeted cancer panel sequencing was performed using DNA from tumor samples of the two patients. Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1)-ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusions were identified. Additional PCR analysis, followed by Sanger sequencing, confirmed the GFPT1-ALK fusion, indicating that the fusion is a result of intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion. Notably, a metastatic MTC case harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to an ALK inhibitor, crizotinib. In conclusion, we found several genetic mutations in MTC and are the first to identify ALK fusions in MTC. Our results suggest that the EML4-ALK fusion in MTC may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target of ALK inhibitors. Furthermore, the GFPT1-ALK fusion may be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy. ",

Neoplastic CCH is commonly observed in patients with germ-line mutations in the RET oncogene (commonly in families with a history of hereditary MTC, i.e. familial MTC or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2)). CCH should be considered in patients with hypercalcitoninemia without nodular thyroidopathy. Total thyroidectomy, which is commonly performed for the majority of thyroid diseases, is an adequate treatment and achieves cure, even in patients with neoplastic CCH.

Cabozantinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with progressive, unresectable locally advanced (in the EU) or metastatic (in the EU and USA) MTC.

Familial non-medullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) comprises about 5-15% of NMTC and is a heterogeneous group of diseases, including both non-syndromic and syndromic forms. Non-syndromic FNMTC tends to manifest papillary thyroid carcinoma , usually multifocal and bilateral . Several high-penetrance genes for FNMTC have been identified, but they are often confined to a few or single families, and other susceptibility loci appear to play a small part, conferring only small increments in risk. Familial susceptibility is likely to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental influences. The current focus of research in FNMTC is to characterise the susceptibility genes and their role in carcinogenesis. FNMTC can also occur as a part of multitumour genetic syndromes such as familial adenomatous polyposis , Cowden's disease , Werner's syndrome and Carney complex . These tend to present at an early age and are multicentric and bilateral with distinct pathology. The clinical evaluation of these patients is similar to that for most patients with a thyroid nodule. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) arises from the parafollicular cells of the thyroid which release calcitonin. The familial form of MTC accounts for 20-25% of cases and presents as a part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndromes or as a pure familial MTC (FMTC). They are caused by germline point mutations in the RET oncogene on chromosome 10q11.2. There is a clear genotype-phenotype correlation, and the aggressiveness of FMTC depends on the specific genetic mutation, which should determine the timing of surgery.",

It occurs in a sporadic form, or less commonly as a hereditary form, as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes types 2A and 2B. The RET proto-oncogene is currently the primary factor that is implicated in the hereditary forms of this neoplasm. The knowledge about the genetic makeup of the neoplasm impacts upon management as it allows for screening, early detection, and prophylactic treatment. Surgery is the main modality that offers a cure. This entails a total thyroidectomy and vigilant management and surveillance of the neck. Prognosis of patients with MTC is variable, but the more constant factors that affect it are the stage of disease and the age of the patient. The emerging molecular genetic understanding of this malignancy will provide the foundation for prognostic and therapeutic decision-making in the future. Interdisciplinary management by surgeons, endocrinologists, pathologists, radiotherapists, radiologists, and medical oncologists should be sought.",

We correlated the clinico-pathological features of MEN2-associated PCC (MEN-PCC) with RET mutations and compared them with non-MEN adrenal-PCCs.;In this retrospective single institution study on a large PCC database (n = 208, 1997-2014) 24 MEN-PCC patients with known RET mutations were reviewed. Excluding 7 with incomplete data, the study cohort of 17 MEN-PCC patients from 11 kindreds (M:F::7:10) was identified. Clinical, biochemical, pathological attributes, and outcomes in the MEN-PCC group were correlated with the genotype, and further compared with non-MEN, apparently sporadic adrenal-PCCs (n = 132, excluding 37 extra-adrenal and 15 VHL/NF1/SDH-associated PCC).;Components of MEN2 encountered included MTC in 13(76.5%), Marfanoid habitus in 2, and PHPT, cutaneous lichen amyloidosis and mucosal neuromas in 1 patient each. In 11(64.7%), PCC was the first detected MEN2 component (Symptomatic:8, Incidentaloma:3). Four (23.5%) were normotensive; 8(47.1%) had bilateral PCC (7 synchronous, 1 metachronous). Surgery for PCC included laparoscopic adrenalectomy in 12; and cortical-sparing adrenalectomy in 2 of 8 bilateral PCC patients. Mean MEN-PCC tumor size was 6.9 ± 3.9 cm, and 6(35%) had additional adrenal medullary hyperplasia. Four different genotypes were encountered, commonest involving codon 634, others being 804 and 918. Mean age in MEN-PCC (27.7 ± 12.2 years) was lower than non-MEN PCC (39.4 ± 15.7, p = 0.018). Proportion of pediatric patients (35.3% in MEN-PCC vs. 12.9% in non-MEN-PCC, p = 0.007), bilateral tumors (47.1% in MEN-PCC, 4.5% in non-MEN-PCC, p < 0.001), and adrenal medullary hyperplasia (35.2% in MEN-PCC, 0.7% in non-MEN-PCC, p < 0.001) were different. Median 24-hour urinary metanephrines was significantly higher in index MEN-PCC patients, than non-MEN-PCC (634 vs. 214 mcg/24 h, p value = 0.006), but was non-significantly higher in non-index MEN-PCC patients. Mean tumor sizes were comparable in the two groups. None of MEN-PCC patients had malignant PCC, compared to 7(5.3%) in non-MEN-PCC.;In this cohort of MEN-PCC from India, the commonest causative RET mutations for MEN-PCC involved codon 634. MEN-PCC patients were younger, and more frequently had bilateral PCC than non-MEN disease. MEN-PCC patients in India are diagnosed with large tumors and extremely high catecholamine/metanephrine levels.",

Germline mutations were found in all 9 of the affected individuals and in 6 of the 27 individuals of unknown status. A 70-year-old man who had been completely asymptomatic before genetic diagnosis underwent left adrenalectomy and total thyroidectomy, and was found to have pheochromocytoma and multifocal micromedullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). A 32-year-old man and a 15-year-old boy, with elevated calcitonin levels detected by the C-cell-stimulation test, but no evident thyroid tumor, underwent total thyroidectomy. Histopathological diagnosis revealed multiple micro MTCs. A 7-year-old girl without evidence of a thyroid tumor or an elevated calcitonin level is being followed up. The remaining two subjects with an evident thyroid tumor and elevated calcitonin levels refused surgery. These results suggest that genetic screening for MEN type 2 afflicted family members can facilitate the presymptomatic detection of gene carriers. Thus, we must carefully evaluate whether immediate prophylactic total thyroidectomy is indicated for gene carriers of MEN 2A without an evident thyroid tumor or elevated calcitonin levels.",

Serious morbidity and mortality rates associated with these tumors are related to the potent effects of catecholamines on various organs, especially those of the cardiovascular system. Before any surgical procedure is done, preoperative blockade is necessary to protect the patient against significant release of catecholamines due to anesthesia and surgical manipulation of the tumor. Treatment options vary with the extent of the disease, with laparoscopic surgery being the preferred treatment for removal of primary tumors. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a malignancy of the thyroid C cells or parafollicular cells. Thyroid C cells elaborate a number of peptides and hormones, such as calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and chromogranin A. Some or all of these markers are elevated in patients with MTC and can be used to confirm the diagnosis as well as to follow patients longitudinally for recurrence. Medullary thyroid cancer consists of a spectrum of diseases that ranges from extremely indolent tumors that are stable for many years to aggressive types associated with a high mortality rate. Genetic testing for RET mutations has allowed identification of familial cases and prophylactic thyroidectomy for cure. The only curative treatment is complete surgical resection.",

Because no more than 10 % of HSCR cases have a late presentation with classical chronic constipation and megacolon, the clinician has to make a difficult, early diagnosis, which is the crux of the clinical problem. The aim of this review paper is to present all tools currently available to make a clear HSCR diagnosis and to discuss the problems facing the clinician and the pediatric surgeon in the correct identification of HSCR and of other intestinal dysganglionoses.;Based on the current state of knowledge and 24 years' personal experience in clinical practice and basic research in this field, I describe an algorithmic approach that enables clinicians and surgeons to rationalize and maximize the clarity of diagnosis through a complementary set of procedures and enzyme-histochemical reactions.;Two innovative techniques, added to the protocol in the last four years, are described: the lyophilized HSCR diagnostic kit, and the one-trocar transumbilical laparoscopic intestinal full-thickness biopsy technique (OTTLB).;The rational, algorithmic diagnostic pathway proposed in this review paper aims to optimize every diagnosis by the stepwise application of a complementary set of procedures and enzyme-histochemical reactions as they become appropriate. In the interests of simplifying genetic molecular diagnosis, I suggest the following guidelines: 1) only in cases of total colonic aganglionosis (TCA) is it advisable to carry out full RET mutation screening (the mutation rate is up to 70 %); and 2) all HSCR patients should be tested only for standard MEN2A and MTC mutations. If these are present, the patients should be followed up carefully with proper surveillance and biochemical testing of other susceptible family members as they are at risk of developing neuroendocrine tumors.",

However, the same is not true for a resource-poor country, where clinicians are still struggling to diagnose and adequately manage this relatively uncommon thyroid malignancy. We hereby present our experience of managing MTC at a tertiary care referral center in North India.;This was a retrospective study conducted between January 1990 and July 2009. Demographics, clinical profiles, details of surgical procedures, and follow-up records were reviewed.;A total of 71 patients with MTC were identified. Mean age of this group was 39.9±14.1 years, and men outnumbered women 1.7:1. Some 84.5% of patients had seemingly sporadic MTC, and 15.5% had familial MTC (MEN2a=14.1%, MEN 2b=1.4%). All patients had a thyroid nodule at the time of presentation. Mean tumor diameter was 4.9 cm. Cervical lymphadenopathy, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, extrathyroidal invasion, and distant metastases were present in 59%, 7.2%, 10%, and 4.2% of patients, respectively. Staging showed that 4.8% of patients were stage I, 17.5% stage II, 14.3% stage III, and 63.6% stage IV. Treatment was as follows: 92.6% of patients had total thyroidectomy (primary or secondary); 67.6% central compartment lymph node dissection, 62.3% lateral cervical lymph node dissection, and 7.2% trans-sternal mediastinal lymph node dissection performed. Some 66.7% of patients suffered from persistent hypercalcitoninemia, and 11.4% of those underwent reoperation. The 5-year and 10-year overall survival (OS) was 74.6% and 58%, respectively.;The majority of the patients with MTC presented at stage IVa, contributing to the high rate of persistent hypercalcitoninemia. Despite a policy of observation and intervening only in overtly symptomatic patients with persistent hypercalcitoninemia, overall survival (OS) in our study was comparable to other series, reinforcing the belief that persistent hypercalcitoninemia has an indolent course in most patients.",

However, ectopic production of PTH is rare and its molecular etiology remains largely uninvestigated. We report a case of ectopic production of PTH by a sporadic MTC. The etiology of ectopic PTH gene expression was examined, focusing on GCM2 which has a crucial role in developing parathyroid glands. We observed ectopic expression of the PTH and GCM2 genes in tissues from the tumor and metastatic lymph nodes. However, GCM2 gene expression was also detected in adjacent thyroid tissue and lymphoblasts, in which PTH gene expression was absent. Hypomethylation of the PTH promoter, which is reportedly associated with ectopic production of PTH, was not seen in either the tumor tissue or metastatic lymph nodes. Meanwhile, DNA hypomethylation was seen in a CpG island identified in the GCM2 promoter region, regardless of whether or not the GCM2 gene was expressed. We showed that transcriptional activity of the CpG island sequences cloned into a reporter plasmid was dependent upon DNA methylation. Finally, we present the first report of a PTH-producing MTC. There was no apparent association between ectopic PTH and GCM2 gene expression, despite co-expression of the two genes. Neither genomic rearrangement nor DNA hypomethylation in the PTH gene appeared responsible for ectopic production of PTH. Although DNA hypomethylation may be necessary for the GCM2 gene expression, ectopic expression of GCM2 won't be possible by DNA hypomethylation alone.",

Many issues related to this tumor are still the subject of debate: the diagnostic management in patients who have had positive genetic study results (RET mutation), variations related to mutation, the best surgical option, and the real relapse rate during long-term follow-up. The aim of this study is to present our experience with this unusual disease, looking for answers to some of these questions.;Of 169 patients belonging to 19 MEN 2A families, 54 (32%) presented with pheochromocytoma. The following variables have been studied: (1) clinical and diagnostic data [age, mutation, clinical features, results of catecholamines and catabolites in a 24-h urine sample, computerized tomography (CT) scan and iodine-131 meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy results, and the means of diagnostic, clinical, or genetic screening]; (2) surgical treatment; and (3) follow-up and recurrence. The mean follow-up time was 92.5 months (range: 12-120 months).;The mean age of the 54 patients was 37.9 years (range: 14-71 years); 33 were women. Most (96.3%) mutations were found in exon 11. The most frequent mutations were Cys634Tyr (in 33 cases [61.1%]) and Cys634Arg (in 14 [25.9%]). The diagnosis of pheocromocytoma was made after the diagnosis of MTC in 26 cases (48.2%), simultaneously in 21 (38.9%), and prior in the 7 remaining cases (12.9%). At the time of diagnosis 28 patients (51.8%) were asymptomatic and 26 (48.2%) had clinical features related to pheochromocytoma. In 6 patients (11.1%), the values of catecholamines and catabolites in urine were normal. In the cases with high values, the most useful isolated determination was that of metanephrines (82%), followed by adrenaline (76%). The CT scan did not provide a correct diagnosis in 6 patients with bilateral lesions, and one patient with a bilateral tumor was not diagnosed by MIBG. The combination of CT scan and MIBG diagnosed 100% of cases. The pheochromocytoma was bilateral in 27 cases, with a total number of 81 pathological glands detected. A laparascopic approach was used in 30 cases and a laparotomy in 24. The mean tumor size was 4.5 cm (range: 1-18 cm). Five patients with unilateral resection relapsed (18.5%), and the mean relapse time was 43.2 months (range: 12-120 months). There was a greater frequency of pheochromocytoma in those subjects who had the Cys634Arg mutation (p < 0.03). In addition, the Cys634Arg mutation is more frequent in bilateral cases. There are no prognostic factors for recurrence.;Pheochromocytoma in MEN 2A is related to the type of mutation, which can be early onset and is frequently asymptomatic. Its diagnosis requires catecholamines determinations as well as a CT scan. Correct diagnosis of bilaterality is established by CT and MIBG. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the treatment of choice.",
