In particular, several chromosomal rearrangements involving TRKA have been reported in colorectal, papillary thyroid, glioblastoma, melanoma, and lung tissue that are believed to be the key oncogenic driver in these tumors. By screening the Novartis compound collection, a novel imidazopyridazine TRK inhibitor was identified that served as a launching point for drug optimization. Structure guided drug design led to the identification of (R)-2-phenylpyrrolidine substituted imidazopyridazines as a series of potent, selective, orally bioavailable pan-TRK inhibitors achieving tumor regression in rats bearing KM12 xenografts. From this work the (R)-2-phenylpyrrolidine has emerged as an ideal moiety to incorporate in bicyclic TRK inhibitors by virtue of its shape complementarity to the hydrophobic pocket of TRKs. ",

Subsequent studies have also characterized morphologic features corresponding to ALK and NTRK1 translocations. In this study, we sought to further compare morphologic features across a range of 49 genetically defined spitzoid neoplasms with ALK, NTRK1, BRAF, or RET fusions to determine discriminating features. We also compared them with a group of 22 spitzoid neoplasms, which were confirmed to be negative for fusions in ALK, NTRK1, BRAF, and RET. Features with the highest discriminatory value included diameter of the lesion, dermal architecture, and certain cytomorphologic features. Specifically, cases with a large diameter (≥9 mm) and wedge-shaped, plexiform dermal architecture of nests of large, spindle-shaped cells were most likely to have an ALK fusion. NTRK1-fused cases were most likely of the fusions to have Kamino bodies and were typically arranged in smaller nests with smaller predominantly spindle-shaped cells, occasionally forming rosettes. BRAF fusion cases were the only fusion subtype to have a predominance of epithelioid cells, were less organized in nests, and commonly had a sheet-like growth pattern or dysplastic Spitz architecture. BRAF fusion cases were most likely to have high-grade nuclear atypia, to be diagnosed as spitzoid melanoma, to have a positive result by melanoma fluorescence in situ hybridization assay, and to develop copy number gains in the kinase domain of the fusion protein. On the basis of experience from this cohort, BRAF-fused cases appear most likely to progress to melanoma.",

More recently, low-frequency rearrangements of TRK kinases have been described in NSCLC, colorectal carcinoma, glioblastoma, and Spitzoid melanoma. Entrectinib, whose discovery and preclinical characterization are reported herein, is a novel, potent inhibitor of ALK, ROS1, and, importantly, of TRK family kinases, which shows promise for therapy of tumors bearing oncogenic forms of these proteins. Proliferation profiling against over 200 human tumor cell lines revealed that entrectinib is exquisitely potent in vitro against lines that are dependent on the drug's pharmacologic targets. Oral administration of entrectinib to tumor-bearing mice induced regression in relevant human xenograft tumors, including the TRKA-dependent colorectal carcinoma KM12, ROS1-driven tumors, and several ALK-dependent models of different tissue origins, including a model of brain-localized lung cancer metastasis. Entrectinib is currently showing great promise in phase I/II clinical trials, including the first documented objective responses to a TRK inhibitor in colorectal carcinoma and in NSCLC. The drug is, thus, potentially suited to the therapy of several molecularly defined cancer settings, especially that of TRK-dependent tumors, for which no approved drugs are currently available.

While TrkA gene is frequently rearranged in cancers, its involvement in malignant melanoma (MM) development is still unclear.;We analyzed a dataset of primary cutaneous MM (n = 31) by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), to identify genomic amplifications associated with tumor progression. The analysis was validated by genomic quantitative PCR (qPCR) on an extended set of cases (n = 64) and the results were correlated with the clinical outcome. To investigate TrkA molecular pathways and cellular function, we generated inducible activation of the NGF-TrkA signaling in human MM cell lines.;We identified amplification of 1q23.1, where the TrkA locus resides, as a candidate hotspot implicated in the progression of MM. Across 40 amplicons detected, segmental amplification of 1q23.1 showed the strongest association with tumor thickness. By validation of the analysis, TrkA gene amplification emerged as a frequent event in primary melanomas (50 % of patients), and correlated with worse clinical outcome. However, experiments in cell lines revealed that induction of the NGF-TrkA signaling produced a phenotype of dramatic suppression of cell proliferation through inhibition of cell division and pronounced intracellular vacuolization, in a way straightly dependent on NGF activation of TrkA. These events were triggered via MAPK activity but not via AKT, and involved p21(cip1) protein increase, compatibly with a mechanism of oncogene-induced growth arrest.;Taken together, our findings point to TrkA as a candidate oncogene in MM and support a model in which the NGF-TrkA-MAPK pathway may mediate a trade-off between neoplastic transformation and adaptive anti-proliferative response.",

As melanocytes share with the nervous system a common neuroectodermal origin and express all neurotrophins (NTs), we evaluated the expression and function of NTs and their receptors in melanoma. We report that primary and metastatic melanoma cell lines synthesize and secrete all NTs. Moreover, melanoma cells express the low-affinity (p75NTR) and the high-affinity tyrosine kinase NT receptors (Trk). The inhibition of Trk receptors by either K252a or Trk/Fc chimeras prevents proliferation, indicating that autocrine NTs are responsible for this effect. NT-3, NT-4, and nerve growth factor (NGF) induce cell migration, with a stronger effect on metastatic cell lines. Transfection with p75NTR small interfering RNA (p75NTRsiRNA) or treatment with K252a inhibits NT-induced melanoma cell migration, indicating that both the low- and high-affinity NT receptors mediate this effect. All melanoma cell lines express the p75NTR coreceptor sortilin by which proNGF stimulates migration in melanoma cells, but not in cells transfected with p75NTRsiRNA.

        "Doc_abstract":"Histopathological evaluation of melanocytic tumours usually allows reliable distinction of benign melanocytic naevi from melanoma. More difficult is the histopathological classification of Spitz tumours, a heterogeneous group of tumours composed of large epithelioid or spindle-shaped melanocytes. Spitz tumours are biologically distinct from conventional melanocytic naevi and melanoma, as exemplified by their distinct patterns of genetic aberrations. Whereas common acquired naevi and melanoma often harbour BRAF mutations, NRAS mutations, or inactivation of NF1, Spitz tumours show HRAS mutations, inactivation of BAP1 (often combined with BRAF mutations), or genomic rearrangements involving the kinases ALK, ROS1, NTRK1, BRAF, RET, and MET. In Spitz naevi, which lack significant histological atypia, all of these mitogenic driver aberrations trigger rapid cell proliferation, but after an initial growth phase, various tumour suppressive mechanisms stably block further growth. In some tumours, additional genomic aberrations may abrogate various tumour suppressive mechanisms, such as cell-cycle arrest, telomere shortening, or DNA damage response. The melanocytes then start to grow in a less organised fashion and may spread to regional lymph nodes, and are termed atypical Spitz tumours. Upon acquisition of even more aberrations, which often activate additional oncogenic pathways or alter cell differentiation, the neoplastic cells become entirely malignant and may colonise and take over distant organs (spitzoid melanoma). The sequential acquisition of genomic aberrations suggests that Spitz tumours represent a continuous biological spectrum, rather than a dichotomy of benign versus malignant, and that tumours with ambiguous histological features (atypical Spitz tumours) might be best classified as low-grade melanocytic tumours. The number of genetic aberrations usually correlates with the degree of histological atypia and explains why existing ancillary genetic techniques, such as array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) or fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), are usually capable of accurately classifying histologically benign and malignant Spitz tumours, but are not very helpful in the diagnosis of ambiguous melanocytic lesions. Nevertheless, we expect that progress in our understanding of tumour progression will refine the classification of spitzoid melanocytic tumours in the near future. By integrating clinical, pathological, and genetic criteria, distinct tumour subsets will be defined within the heterogeneous group of Spitz tumours, which will eventually lead to improvements in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy.

These cells express aberrant levels of functional p75(NTR) and TrkC, the putative high-affinity receptor for the neurotrophin NT-3. Here we demonstrate that, by using sensitive immune-complex kinase assays in human brain-metastatic (70W) melanoma cells, TrkC receptors associate with a kinase activity exhibiting a dose-dependent susceptibility to inhibition by the purine-analogs 6-thioguanine and 2-aminopurine. The activity of this purine-analog-sensitive kinase (PASK) was induced by NT-3 in a time-dependent fashion, phosphorylating exogenous myelin basic protein (MBP) but not denatured enolase. It is similar to the one reported to relate with p75(NTR) and TrkA receptors and stimulated by the prototypic NT, nerve growth factor. Thus, PASKs may represent unique signaling components common to NT receptors that could engage joint downstream signaling effectors in brain-metastatic melanoma.",

Therefore, the development of an alternative approach replacing the traditional therapy is urgently needed. To assess the killing efficiency of the functionally identified apoptosis-related protein (APR)-1 in melanoma cells, we established a system for the regulated expression of APR-1. The induction of APR-1 expression caused apoptosis of melanoma cells via the interaction with the juxtamembrane region of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), and possible also via the competition with tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6) and the catalytic receptor of neurotrophin (Trk) for the same p75NTR interacting site. The accumulation of APR-1 in melanoma cells may block the physical association of p75NRT with TRAF6 and/or Trk, leading to the disruption of both NF-κB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. Also, accumulation of APR-1 protein enhanced the activity of both c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 pathways. However, the analysis of APR-1-modulated pathways demonstrated the involvement of apoptosis-regulating kinase 1-JNK/p38 pathway in the induction of Bax expression leading to both mitochondrial dysregulation [as demonstrated by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of both cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor into cytoplasm, and cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)] and endoplasmic reticulum stress as demonstrated by the increase of intracellular Ca(2+)  release.

The expression of three NTs (NGF, BDNF, and NT-3) and their receptors (NTRs; i.e. low-affinity pan-NT receptor p75, Trk-B, and Trk-C) was studied in frozen sections of benign and malignant cutaneous pigment cell lesions, using immunohistochemistry. In order to understand the possible role of these growth factors and their receptors in the progression of primary cutaneous malignant melanomas (PCMMs), their distribution in the radial (RGP) and vertical (VGP) growth phases was particularly studied. While most of the common acquired naevi were unreactive, Spitz and blue naevi showed scattered immunoreactive cells, especially for the p75 NTR. Dysplastic naevi, but not common naevi, expressed NT-3 in their junctional component. PCMM and melanoma metastases often showed a diffuse pattern of immunostaining. NT-3 was significantly more frequently expressed in the RGP of PCMMs than in the junctional component of benign naevi, whereas more extensive immunoreactivity for NGF was found in the VGP of PCMMs, compared with the RGP; metastases more frequently expressed NGF, BDNF, and Trk-B than PCMMs. Interestingly, neurotropic melanoma expressed all NTs/NTRs except Trk-B. These immuunohistochemical data confirm suggestions from previous in vitro studies that autocrine loops of certain NTs and their respective receptors may be involved in melanoma progression; in addition, NT-3 may be involved in the junctional growth of dysplastic naevi. The precise role of these growth factors in melanoma, however, will await further functional studies.",

This line harbors a N-ras gene mutated in codon 61. To investigate other cellular genes possibly contributing to the expression of its transformed phenotype, four XP44 revertant cell lines were isolated by different selection procedures and the association of the level of expression of various oncogenes (including N-ras) and tumor suppressor genes with the selection for the revertant phenotype was determined. The revertants exhibited a significant but variable degree of phenotypic reversion, according to the selective pressure to which they were submitted, and a phenotypic stability dependent on their constant maintenance in selective medium. Back-revertant lines were isolated by culturing revertant lines in control medium for several weeks. The comparison between parental, revertant and back-revertant cells has revealed that, beyond the mutation in codon 61 of N-ras, two groups of genes appear to be also implicated in the transformation process of XP44 RO (Mel) cells: one group, comprising pim A, trk, Rb and p53, whose expression is independent of the cell selection conditions; the other group, comprising Ha-ras, N-ras, neu 1, fos and met H, whose expression is more or less dependent upon such conditions. The myc gene is apparently not involved in this phenomenon. These results, besides strengthening the concept that carcinogenesis is a multigenic process, suggest that diverse mechanisms can lead to the transformed phenotype, but that these mechanisms might have some pathway(s) in common.",

The regions around the GH1 and GH2 domains of GIPC1 are involved in dimerization and interaction with myosin VI (MYO6), respectively. The PDZ domain of GIPC1 is involved in interactions with transmembrane proteins [IGF1R, NTRK1, ADRB1, DRD2, TGFβR3 (transforming growth factorβ receptor type III), SDC4, SEMA4C, LRP1, NRP1, GLUT1, integrin α5 and VANGL2], cytosolic signaling regulators (APPL1 and RGS19) and viral proteins (HBc and HPV-18 E6). GIPC1 is an adaptor protein with dimerizing ability that loads PDZ ligands as cargoes for MYO6-dependent endosomal trafficking. GIPC1 is required for cell-surface expression of IGF1R and TGFβR3. GIPC1 is also required for integrin recycling during cell migration, angiogenesis and cytokinesis. On early endosomes, GIPC1 assembles receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and APPL1 for activation of PI3K-AKT signaling, and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and RGS19 for attenuation of inhibitory Gα signaling. GIPC1 upregulation in breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers promotes tumor proliferation and invasion, whereas GIPC1 downregulation in cervical cancer with human papillomavirus type 18 infection leads to resistance to cytostatic transforming growth factorβ signaling. GIPC2 is downregulated in acute lymphocytic leukemia owing to epigenetic silencing, while Gipc2 is upregulated in estrogen-induced mammary tumors. Somatic mutations of GIPC2 occur in malignant melanoma, and colorectal and ovarian cancers. Germ-line mutations of the GIPC3 or MYO6 gene cause nonsyndromic hearing loss. As GIPC proteins are involved in trafficking, signaling and recycling of RTKs, GPCRs, integrins and other transmembrane proteins, dysregulation of GIPCs results in human pathologies, such as cancer and hereditary deafness.",

Therefore genetic testing is recommended for all patients presenting with MTC. Approximately 40% of MTCs have somatic RET mutations. Somatic mutations in the RAS genes are the next most common driver mutations and appear to be mutually exclusive with germline RET mutation. The single most common somatic RAS mutation is HRASQ61R (c.182A>G), reported in 4.6% to 11% of all MTCs. Mutation-specific immunohistochemistry (IHC) initially developed to identify the NRASQ61R mutation in melanoma (clone SP174) has proven highly sensitive and specific. Because the amino acid sequences for the HRAS and NRAS proteins at codon 61 are identical, we postulated that SP174 IHC would also identify the somatic HRASQ61R mutation. IHC with SP174 was performed on a tissue microarray of 68 patients with MTC including 13 (22.8%) with molecularly confirmed MEN2. Seven (10.3%) MTCs demonstrated positive staining. Six of these patients had already undergone germline RET mutation testing as part of clinical care and were all confirmed to be wild type, excluding the diagnosis of MEN2. All SP174 immunohistochemically positive MTCs were proven to have HRASQ61R mutation (and lack KRASQ61R and NRASQ61R) by Sanger sequencing. All MEN2 patients showed negative staining. We conclude that IHC with SP174 is highly specific for the HRASQ61R mutation in MTC. Because current data suggest that this mutation is mutually exclusive with germline RET mutation, IHC may also have a role in triaging formal genetic testing for MEN2.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

The proof was obtained in the early 1950's by work initiated by Rita Levi-Montalcini (RLM) discovering the nerve growth factor (NGF). Today, NGF and its relatives, collectively designated neurotrophins, are well recognized as mediators of multiple biological phenomena in health and disease, ranging from the neurotrophic through immunotrophic and epitheliotrophic to metabotrophic effects. Consequently, NGF and other neurotrophins are implicated in the pathogenesis of a large spectrum of neuronal and non-neuronal diseases, from Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases to atherosclerosis and other cardiometabolic diseases. Recent studies demonstrated the therapeutic potentials of NGF in these diseases, including ocular and cutaneous diseases. Furthermore, NGF TrkA receptor antagonists emerged as novel drugs for pain, prostate and breast cancer, melanoma, and urinary bladder syndromes. Altogether, NGF's multiple potential in health and disease is briefly described here. ",

Many possible causes of multiple malignancies have been reported such as genetic alterations, exposure to anti-cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy and reduced immunologic response. We report a female patient with multiple sclerosis and quadruple cancers of different embryological origin. Patient was diagnosed with stage III (T3, N1a, MO) medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), multicentric micropapillary thyroid carcinoma, scapular and lumbar melanomas (Clark II, Breslow II), and lobular invasive breast carcinoma (T1a, NO, MO). All tumors present in our patient except micropapillary thyroid carcinomas were investigated for gene alterations known to have a key role in cancer promotion and progression. Tumor samples were screened for the p16 alterations (loss of heterozygosity and homozygous deletions), loss of heterozygosity of PTEN, p53 alterations (mutational status and loss of heterozygosity) and mutational status of RET, HRAS and KRAS. Each type of tumor investigated had specific pattern of analyzed genetic alterations. The most prominent genetic changes were mutual alterations in PTEN and p53 tumor suppressors present in breast cancer and two melanomas. These co-alterations could be crucial for promoting development of multiple malignancies. Moreover the insertion in 4(th) codon of HRAS gene was common for all tumor types investigated. It represents frameshift mutation introducing stop codon at position 5 which prevents synthesis of a full-length protein. Since the inactivated RAS enhances sensitivity to tamoxifen and radiotherapy this genetic alteration could be considered as a good prognostic factor for this patient. ",

The imaging probe is equipped with a set of three interchangeable knife-edge pinhole collimators (0.94, 1.2, or 2.1 mm effective diameter at 140 keV) and its focal distance can be regulated in order to set a given field of view (FOV). A typical FOV of 70 mm at 50 mm skin-to-collimator distance corresponds to a minification factor 1:5. The detector is operated at a single low-energy threshold of about 20 keV.;For 99 mTc, at 50 mm distance, a background-subtracted sensitivity of 6.5 x 10(-3) cps/kBq and a system spatial resolution of 5.5 mm FWHM were obtained for the 0.94 mm pinhole; corresponding values for the 2.1 mm pinhole were 3.3 x 10(-2) cps/kBq and 12.6 mm.

While there are numerous studies reporting the role of NRAGE in facilitating cell death by interaction with p75NTR, we found varied effects of Dlxin-1 over-expression on PC12 cells grown in presence of NGF. These include induction of increased cell survival in presence of NGF and accelerated neuronal differentiation. We here categorically demonstrate that the effects on neuritogenesis are promoted through interactions of Dlxin-1 with the neurotrophin receptor TrkA. Further, using pharmacological inhibitors to specific pathways, we delineate the effects on enhanced neuritogenesis to the early and sustained activation of MEK pathway whereas the effects on cell survival to the early activation of Akt pathway. Next, we demonstrate a physical interaction of necdin with Dlxin-1 in PC12 cells. Our results establish that Dlxin-1 is an enhancer of neuronal differentiation and suggests that its possible interaction with NGF and necdin is critical in mediating pathways involved in neuronal survival and differentiation. Further in-depth analyses of the activation of various signalling pathways mediated through interaction with Dlxin-1 may provide valuable insight on the mechanisms that govern decisions regarding neuronal survival, growth, differentiation or apoptosis.",
