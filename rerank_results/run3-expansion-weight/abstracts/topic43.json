        "Doc_abstract":"Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS) or Gorlin-Goltz syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder, mainly due to PTCH1 gene mutations, that comprises a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. The presence of multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) is a cardinal sign in NBCCS, therefore cases in which BCCs are absent entails a delay in the diagnosis.We present a 14 years old boy with a clinical diagnosis of NBCCS by the presence of odontogenic cysts, hypertelorism, macrocephaly, and corpus callosum agenesia, but with absence of skin lesions. His 43 years old mother has NBCCS diagnosis and no history of BCCs. For a deeper study, PTCH1 mutation screening from peripheral blood samples were performed by both bidirectional sequencing and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) techniques. The proband and his mother carry 25 pb duplication in exon 10 (c.1375dupl25bp) that causes a reading frameshift with a premature stop codon. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that this mutation results in a truncated protein shorter than normal. Our results suggest that complete clinical and genealogical studies accompanied by genetic analysis are essential in the early detection of the NBCCS cases such the one presented here. ",

Mutations in the SMO gene have been identified in basal cell carcinoma and in medulloblastoma, both of which are features of NBCCS. To clarify the role of PTCH1 and SMO in KCOTs, we undertook mutational analysis of PTCH1 and SMO in 20 sporadic and 10 NBCCS-associated KCOTs, and for SMO, 20 additional cases of KCOTs with known PTCH1 status were also included. Eleven novel (1 of which occurred twice) and 5 known PTCH1 mutations were identified. However, no pathogenic mutation was detected in SMO.

NBCCS is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited disease mainly characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas, KCOTs of the jaws and a variety of other tumors. PTCH1 mutation can be found both in sporadic or NBCCS associated KCOTs. The aim of the current study was to assess whether a combined clinical and bio-molecular approach could be suitable for the detection of NBCCS among patients with a diagnosis of keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOTs). The authors collected keratocystic odontogenic tumors recorded in the database of the Pathology Department of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia during the period 1991-2011. Through interviews and examinations, family pedigrees were drawn for all patients affected by these odontogenic lesions. We found out that 18 of the 70 patients with KCOTs and/or multiple basal cell carcinomas actually met the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of NBCCS. A wide inter- and intra-familial phenotypic variability was evident in the families. Ameloblastomas (AMLs) were reported in two probands that are also carriers of the PCTH1 germline mutations. Nine germline mutations in the PTCH1 gene, 5 of them novel, were evident in 14 tested probands. The clinical evaluation of the keratocystic odontogenic tumors can be used as screening for the detection of families at risk of NBCCS. Keratocystic odontogenic lesions are uncommon, and their discovery deserves the search for associated cutaneous basal cell carcinomas and other benign and malignant tumors related to NBCCS.",

PTCH1 is part of the hedgehog signalling pathway, and derangements within this pathway are now known to be important in the carcinogenesis of many different cancers including sporadic basal cell carcinoma. The molecular biology of the hedgehog pathway is discussed, and mouse models of basal cell carcinoma based on this pathway are explored. New developments in non-surgical treatment of basal cell carcinoma are based on this knowledge. Other genes of importance to basal cell carcinoma development include the tumour suppressor gene P53 and the melanocortin-1 receptor gene. In addition, we discuss molecules of possible importance such as the glutathione-S-transferases, DNA repair genes, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, Brahma and connexins.

Factors in OTRs conferring increased susceptibility to BCC include ultraviolet radiation exposure, immunosuppression, viral infections such as human papillomavirus, phototype and genetic predisposition. The PTCH1 gene is a negative regulator of the hedgehog pathway, that provides mitogenic signals to basal cells in skin. PTCH1 gene mutations cause naevoid BCC syndrome, and contribute to the development of sporadic BCC and other types of cancers. Associations have been reported between PTCH1 polymorphisms and BCC susceptibility in nontransplanted individuals.;To search for novel common polymorphisms in the proximal 5' regulatory region upstream of PTCH1 gene exon 1B, and to investigate the possible association of PTCH1 polymorphisms and haplotypes with BCC risk after organ transplantation.;Three PTCH1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs2297086, rs2066836 and rs357564) were analysed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 161 northern Italian OTRs (56 BCC cases and 105 controls). Two regions of the PTCH1 gene promoter were screened by heteroduplex analysis in 30 cases and 30 controls.;Single locus analysis showed no significant association. Haplotype T(1686)-T(3944) appeared to confer a significantly higher risk for BCC development (odds ratio 2.98, 95% confidence interval 2.55-3.48; P = 0.001). Two novel rare polymorphisms were identified at positions 176 and 179 of the 5'UTR. Two novel alleles of the -4 (CGG)(n) microsatellite were identified. No association of this microsatellite with BCC was observed.;Haplotypes containing T(1686)-T(3944) alleles were shown to be associated with an increased BCC risk in our study population. These data appear to be of great interest for further investigations in a larger group of transplant individuals.

Many of these mutations, including mutations in the C-terminus of the large intracellular loop (ICL) of ptch1 (p.C727VfsX745 and p.S733IfsX736), result in the premature truncation of the protein. The ptch1‑C727VfsX745 and ptch1-S733IfsX736 mutations have been identified in patients with NBCCS‑associated keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOTs). In the present study, we found that the molecular mechanisms regulated by the non-canonical Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway through cyclin B1 are involved in the pathogenesis of NBCCS-associated KCOTs. In contrast to wild-type ptch1, ptch1-C727VfsX745 and ptch1‑S733IfsX736 clearly exhibited reduced binding to cyclin B1. Moreover, the cells expressing these two mutations demonstrated an increase in cell cycle progression and these two mutation constructs failed to inhibit cell proliferation. In addition, the mutants enhanced the activity of glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger 1 (GLI1), a downstream reporter of Hh signaling. Thus, our data suggest that the non-canonical Hh pathway mediated through ptch1 and cyclin B1 is involved in the pathogenesis of NBCCS-associated KCOTs. The C-terminus of ICL in ptch1 may also be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of this disease.",

The objective of the current study was to evaluate whether a combined clinical and biomolecular approach could be useful for the identification of NBCCS among patients with a diagnosis of ameloblastoma. The authors collected ameloblastoma tumors recorded in the databases of the Pathology Departments of the University of Modena during the period 1991-2011.

Two patients with ameloblastoma were also affected by multiple basal cell carcinomas and odontogenic keratocysts tumors (OKCTs) achieving the requested clinical criteria for the diagnosis of NBCCS. The clinical diagnoses were confirmed by the identification of two different novel PTCH1 germline mutations (c.2186A > T [p.K729 M]; c.931insA) in those unrelated patients. Clinical ameloblastoma findings can be used as screening for the identification of families at risk of NBCCS.

Mice in which one copy of Ptch1 is inactivated show increased susceptibility to spontaneous tumor development and hypersensitivity to radiation-induced tumorigenesis, providing an ideal in vivo model to study the typical pathologies associated with basal cell nevus syndrome. We therefore examined BCC development in control and irradiated Ptch1(neo67/+) mice. We show that unirradiated mice develop putative BCC precursor lesions, i.e., basaloid hyperproliferation areas arising from both follicular and interfollicular epithelium, and that these lesions progress to nodular and infiltrative BCCs only in irradiated mice. Data of BCC incidence, multiplicity, and latency support the notion of epidermal hyperproliferations, nodular and infiltrative BCC-like tumors representing different stages of tumor development. This is additionally supported by the pattern of p53 protein expression observed in BCC subtypes and by the finding of retention of the normal remaining Ptch1 allele in all nodular, circumscribed BCCs analyzed compared with its constant loss in infiltrative BCCs. Our data suggest chronological tumor progression from basaloid hyperproliferations to nodular and then infiltrative BCC occurring in a stepwise fashion through the accumulation of sequential genetic alterations.",

However these patients also develop BCCs in sun-protected areas of the skin, suggesting the existence of other mechanisms for BCC predisposition in NBCCS patients. As increasing evidence supports the idea that the stroma influences carcinoma development, we hypothesized that NBCCS fibroblasts could facilitate BCC occurence of the patients. WT (n = 3) and NBCCS fibroblasts bearing either nonsense (n = 3) or missense (n = 3) PTCH1 mutations were cultured in dermal equivalents made of a collagen matrix and their transcriptomes were compared by whole genome microarray analyses. Strikingly, NBCCS fibroblasts over-expressed mRNAs encoding pro-tumoral factors such as Matrix Metalloproteinases 1 and 3 and tenascin C. They also over-expressed mRNA of pro-proliferative diffusible factors such as fibroblast growth factor 7 and the stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha, known for its expression in carcinoma associated fibroblasts.

The possibility of underlying genetic abnormalities in these familial BCCs has not been explored previously. The present study investigated a possible genetic abnormality in two members of a family with multiple nonsyndromic BCCs. The possibility of Gorlin syndrome in this family was excluded by both the absence of any clinical and radiological features and the lack of mutation in PTCH1. Notably, whole-genome comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) identified a microdeletion in chromosome 22q11.1 in both of the studied cases. A tiling path CGH array of the 22q11.1 region confirmed this microdeletion and mapped it between 14.46 and 14.5 Mb on chromosome 22q. The 34-kb region of this microdeletion includes three annotated genes: LOC644525, LOC100132389, and LOC729057.

Basal cell naevus syndrome (BCNS) comprises both multiple BCCs and multiple OKs, in addition to several other systemic manifestations. The genetic defect underlying this autosomal dominant syndrome is a germ line mutation in the Sonic Hedgehog receptor PATCHED (PTCH) gene. For this study, a rabbit anti-peptide PTCH antiserum was produced. Immunohistochemistry procedures were performed using PTCH antibody and commercially produced GLI-1 antibody (downstream member in the hedgehog pathway) to stain 11 BCNS-OKs, eight sporadic OKs, two BCNS-BCCs, and six sporadic BCCs. Most of these lesions had been previously screened for PTCH mutation. Most BCCs (n=7) demonstrated moderate staining, with the heaviest staining in the outer palisading cell layer, except a BCNS-BCC which had mutation proximal to the sequence used for production of immunogenic peptide; this demonstrated only weak staining. Although moderate to heavy staining with PTCH antibody was demonstrated in the epithelium of both types of OK (n=19), a quite different pattern of staining of the basal cell layer was observed in the two patient groups. In BCNS, OK staining was heaviest in basal epithelial layers. In contrast, staining in non-BCNS odontogenic keratocysts was exclusively located in the superficial epithelial layers. Up-regulation of PTCH and GLI-1 protein was demonstrated in both BCCs and OKs. The pattern of PTCH expression matched the PTCH transcript pattern previously reported in BCCs and appeared sufficiently characteristic in OKs to allow differentiation between syndromic and non-syndromic cysts.",

Ovarian fibromas in NBCCS before puberty are very rare. We report a 6-year-old prepubescent girl with NBCCS showing skeletal abnormalities, medulloblastoma, and ovarian fibromas. The patient was referred to our hospital owing to abdominal distension. On admission, a huge elastic hard tumor was palpable and computed tomography showed a huge tumor of the left ovary. We performed a left salpingo-oophorectomy and diagnosed the tumor as a benign fibroma. Further examination of the computed tomography images showed skeletal abnormalities. In addition, the patient had a history of medulloblastoma at the age of 4 years. Therefore, we diagnosed NBCCS. A genetic examination indicated a novel 1 bp deletion in exon 18 (c.3055delG). Sequence analysis of exon 18 using DNA from the ovarian tumor revealed a mutant allele (c.3055delG) dominant to the wild-type allele, thus suggesting loss of heterozygosity in the PTCH1 gene, which is known to be associated with NBCCS. Conclusion On the basis of our experience, physicians treating pediatric ovarian tumors should be aware that such huge benign ovarian tumors may be a phenotype of NBCCS, as shown in our patient. In addition, genetic examination focusing on the PTCH1 gene might be important for diagnosis of NBCCS in pediatric patients. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), also known as Gorlin syndrome, is a hereditary condition characterized by a wide range of developmental abnormalities and a predisposition to neoplasms. The estimated prevalence varies from 1/57,000 to 1/256,000, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1. Main clinical manifestations include multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), odontogenic keratocysts of the jaws, hyperkeratosis of palms and soles, skeletal abnormalities, intracranial ectopic calcifications, and facial dysmorphism (macrocephaly, cleft lip/palate and severe eye anomalies). Intellectual deficit is present in up to 5% of cases. BCCs (varying clinically from flesh-colored papules to ulcerating plaques and in diameter from 1 to 10 mm) are most commonly located on the face, back and chest. The number of BBCs varies from a few to several thousand. Recurrent jaw cysts occur in 90% of patients. Skeletal abnormalities (affecting the shape of the ribs, vertebral column bones, and the skull) are frequent. Ocular, genitourinary and cardiovascular disorders may occur. About 5-10% of NBCCS patients develop the brain malignancy medulloblastoma, which may be a potential cause of early death. NBCCS is caused by mutations in the PTCH1 gene and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance and variable expressivity. Clinical diagnosis relies on specific criteria. Gene mutation analysis confirms the diagnosis. Genetic counseling is mandatory. Antenatal diagnosis is feasible by means of ultrasound scans and analysis of DNA extracted from fetal cells (obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling). Main differential diagnoses include Bazex syndrome, trichoepithelioma papulosum multiplex and Torre's syndrome (Muir-Torre's syndrome). Management requires a multidisciplinary approach. Keratocysts are treated by surgical removal. Surgery for BBCs is indicated when the number of lesions is limited; other treatments include laser ablation, photodynamic therapy and topical chemotherapy. Radiotherapy should be avoided. Vitamin A analogs may play a preventive role against development of new BCCs. Life expectancy in NBCCS is not significantly altered but morbidity from complications can be substantial. Regular follow-up by a multi-specialist team (dermatologist, neurologist and odontologist) should be offered. Patients with NBCCS should strictly avoid an excessive sun exposure.",

Genotype-phenotype correlation has not been established. PTCH1 is a member of hedgehog signaling, which is a highly conserved pathway in vertebrates, composed of hedgehog, SMO, and GLI proteins as well as PTCH1. Given that hedgehog signaling regulates cell growth and development, disorder of this pathway gives rise to not only developmental anomalies but also diverse tumors such as those seen in Gorlin syndrome. We recently reported, for the first time, a nationwide survey of Gorlin syndrome in Japan, noting that the frequency was 1/235,800 in the Japanese population, and that the frequency of basal cell carcinomas was significantly lower in Japan than in the USA and Europe, suggesting that ethnicity and genetic background contribute to these differences.

Although the requirement for Hedgehog in BCC is well established, the identity of disease-initiating cells and the compartments in which they reside remain controversial. By using several inducible Cre drivers to delete Ptch1 in different cell compartments in mice, we show here that multiple hair follicle stem cell populations readily develop BCC-like tumors. In contrast, stem cells within the interfollicular epidermis do not efficiently form tumors. Notably, we observed that innervated Gli1-expressing progenitors within mechanosensory touch dome epithelia are highly tumorigenic. Sensory nerves activate Hedgehog signaling in normal touch domes, while denervation attenuates touch dome-derived tumors. Together, our studies identify varying tumor susceptibilities among different stem cell populations in the skin, highlight touch dome epithelia as \"hot spots\" for tumor formation, and implicate cutaneous nerves as mediators of tumorigenesis.",

All three cell lines showed cellular morphology similar to that of BCC tumors and could be propagated for at least 20 passages. In addition, similar to BCC tumors, all cell lines had lost the wildtype Ptch1 allele, expressed BCC molecular markers, and responded similarly to cyclopamine, a small molecule inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling. Finally, we describe an efficient electroporation technique for DNA transfection into the BCC cell lines and show that they have activated Hedgehog signaling activity, albeit at a level lower than that of murine BCCs in vivo.

It is characterized by developmental anomalies and predisposition to tumors (for example, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and medulloblastoma). PTCH1, the human homolog of the Drosophila patched gene, was identified as a gene responsible for BCNS. The PTCH1 protein is a Hedgehog (Hh) protein receptor and is pivotal for early development, stem cell maintenance and/or differentiation. We analyzed the six Japanese families with BCNS and identified six germline mutations in the PTCH1 gene. One family had a nonsense mutation (c.1196G>A), one had a 1-bp deletion (c.2029delA), two had 2-bp deletions (c.239_240delGA and c.1670_1671delCA) and one had a 58-bp duplication (c.1138_1195dup). They caused premature termination, resulting in the truncation of the PTCH1 protein. Analysis of a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping array showed a large approximately 1.2-Mb deletion, including the PTCH1 gene in one allele, in a family in which PTCH1 mutations were not identified at the sequence level. These data indicated that all the six families who were diagnosed with BCNS had mutations in the PTCH1 gene and that a single copy of a PTCH1 mutation causes BCNS.",

The main groups are nodular (nBCC) and superficial (sBCC) ones. The major recognized risk factors for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) are exposure to chronic and intermittent burning doses of sunlight.

While sBCCs tended to occur on unexposed body sites in phototype I/II subjects who mainly avoided direct sunlight, nBCCs tended to occur on sun-exposed body sites in phototype III subjects who were frequently in direct sunlight.;Thus the development of particular BCC subtypes is partially dependent on phototype and personal sun behaviour.",

This study also aims to organize the symptoms often observed in Korea using previously published case reports to provide useful information for the early diagnosis of NBCCS. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the commonest tumor in human. About 70% sporadic BCCs bear somatic mutations in the PATCHED1 tumor suppressor gene which encodes the receptor for the Sonic Hedgehog morphogen (SHH). PATCHED1 germinal mutations are associated with the dominant Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS), a major hallmark of which is a high susceptibility to BCCs. Although the vast majority of sporadic BCCs arises exclusively in sun exposed skin areas, 40 to 50% BCCs from NBCCS patients develop in non photo-exposed skin. Since overwhelming evidences indicate that microenvironment may both be modified by- and influence the- epithelial tumor, we hypothesized that NBCCS fibroblasts could contribute to BCCs in NBCCS patients, notably those developing in non photo-exposed skin areas. The functional impact of NBCCS fibroblasts was then assessed in organotypic skin cultures with control keratinocytes. Onset of epidermal differentiation was delayed in the presence of primary NBCCS fibroblasts. Unexpectedly, keratinocyte proliferation was severely reduced and showed high levels of nuclear P53 in both organotypic skin cultures and in fibroblast-led conditioning experiments. However, in spite of increased levels of senescence associated β-galactosidase activity in keratinocytes cultured in the presence of medium conditioned by NBCCS fibroblasts, we failed to observe activation of P16 and P21 and then of bona fide features of senescence. Constitutive extinction of P53 in WT keratinocytes resulted in an invasive phenotype in the presence of NBCCS fibroblasts. Finally, we found that expression of SHH was limited to fibroblasts but was dependent on the presence of keratinocytes. Inhibition of SHH binding resulted in improved epidermal morphogenesis. Altogether, these data suggest that the repertoire of diffusible factors (including SHH) expressed by primary NBCCS fibroblasts generate a stress affecting keratinocytes behavior and epidermal homeostasis. Our findings suggest that defects in dermo/epidermal interactions could contribute to BCC susceptibility in NBCCS patients. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and a subset of medulloblastomas are characterized by loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, PTCH1. PTCH1 normally functions by repressing the activity of the Smoothened (SMO) receptor. Inactivating PTCH1 mutations result in constitutive Hedgehog pathway activity through uncontrolled SMO signaling. Targeting this pathway with vismodegib, a novel SMO inhibitor, results in impressive tumor regression in patients harboring genetic defects in this pathway. However, a secondary mutation in SMO has been reported in medulloblastoma patients following relapse on vismodegib to date. This mutation preserves pathway activity, but appears to confer resistance by interfering with drug binding. Here we report for the first time on the molecular mechanisms of resistance to vismodegib in two BCC cases. The first case, showing progression after 2 months of continuous vismodegib (primary resistance), exhibited the new SMO G497W mutation. The second case, showing a complete clinical response after 5 months of treatment and a subsequent progression after 11 months on vismodegib (secondary resistance), exhibited a PTCH1 nonsense mutation in both the pre- and the post-treatment specimens, and the SMO D473Y mutation in the post-treatment specimens only. In silico analysis demonstrated that SMO(G497W) undergoes a conformational rearrangement resulting in a partial obstruction of the protein drug entry site, whereas the SMO D473Y mutation induces a direct effect on the binding site geometry leading to a total disruption of a stabilizing hydrogen bond network. Thus, the G497W and D473Y SMO mutations may represent two different mechanisms leading to primary and secondary resistance to vismodegib, respectively.",

Recently, it has been shown that ultraviolet (UV) B exposure produced more BCCs in ptch knockout mice than wild mice.;To Investigate the role of UV in development of BCCs in NBCCS, cellular sensitivity to killing by UVB and removal of UVB-induced oxidative DNA damage were examined using fibroblasts derived from patients with NBCCS under physiologically relevant doses of UVB exposure.;Three patients with NBCCS, a 59-year-old male patient, an 18-year-old boy and a 13-year-old boy were examined by photobiological analysis. Cellular sensitivity to killing by UVB and UVC and removal of oxidative DNA damage caused by UVB were tested using fibroblasts derived from these patients. We measured cellular 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) after UVB exposure up to 24 h after UVB exposure using high-performance liquid chromatography.;All three cell strains derived from the patients with NBCCS were hypersensitive to killing by UVB (D10: 50-70% of normal) but not by UVC. After UVB exposure, the production of 8-OHdG increased dose dependently up to 3200 J m-2 in both NBCCS cells and normal cells. In normal cells, 8-OHdG after UVB exposure returned to its basal level during 24 h, whereas in NBCCS cells the amount of 8-OHdG after 800 J m-2 of UVB exposure did not return to its basal level even after 24 h. The result indicates the removal of 8-OHdG could be impaired in NBCCS cells. Ability in removal of thymine dimers of NBCCS cells was similar to that of normal cells.;Hypersensitivity to UVB can be one of the diagnostic tools of NBCCS for those whose clinical features have not yet completed. Hypersensitivity to cell killing and the impairment of removal of 8-OHdG after UVB exposure may play some role in developing BCCs and other tumours in NBCCS.",

The purpose of this study was to report the varied radiological and dermatological manifestations of our patients affected with NBCCS and to present this rare syndrome as a differential diagnosis of skeletal anomalies.;Between 1994 and 2005 the demographic, clinical, radiological and histological data of 8 patients with NBCCS were retrospectively analyzed. Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome was diagnosed in the event of two major or one major and two minor criteria. The major criteria are more than 2 basal cell carcinoma, odontogenic keratocysts, three or more palmar pits, and calcification of the falx cerebri.;Between 1994 and 2005 8 patients (3 females and 5 males) with NBCCS were treated in our departments. The average age at the time of diagnosis of NBCCS was 49.9 years. All patients had a minimum of two major criteria. The major criteria with the most frequency were the basal cell carcinoma (6 patients) and the odontogenic keratocysts (5 patients), followed by the calcification of the falx cerebri and palmoplantar pits (4 patients). There was no gender-related or age-related predilection and only one patient was affected with pain in his fingers which radiologically correlated to small cystic bone lesions (\"flame-shaped lucencies\").;Due to limitations in identification of mutations in the PTCH1 gene, clinical and radiological examination still remains a very important factor in the treatment of patients suffering from NBCCS. The knowledge of the varied skeletal manifestations and constellations is therefore essential and correlates with therapeutic consequences. Often chest, rib, spine, skull, and jaw X-rays show the way. Due to the risk of the development of an associated medulloblastoma, neurological surveillance in 6-month intervals in addition to an annual MRI of the cerebrum up to an age of 7 is strongly recommended.",

Computer-assisted reconstruction shows that these nests join in three dimensions, but it remains unknown whether this tumour is monoclonal. An early event in BCC formation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the Patched 1 (Ptch1) locus, can be used as a tool to address whether this tumour is monoclonal.;To determine whether superficial BCC is monoclonal by analysing individually microdissected superficial BCC nests and looking for the same pattern of LOH in each.;Six cases of superficial BCC were analysed for LOH at the Ptch1 gene locus using the D9S287 microsatellite marker. Identical allelic patterns were sought in each nest from a given tumour. These patterns were no allelic loss, loss of the shorter allele or loss of the longer allele, each with a respective probability of occurrence, as estimated from published findings.;All cases were informative. Four cases showed no LOH in each nest and two showed loss of the same allele. If these nests arose independently, then the probability of this result was between 4 x 10-11 and 2 x 10-14. The lack of LOH, seen in four cases, could be due to monoclonal expansion of a cell retaining both D9S287 alleles, or due to a polyclonal proliferation. Therefore, a separate analysis excluding these cases was done, giving a probability of between 2.2 x 10-4 and 1.0 x 10-7.;These probabilities were so extreme that it was unlikely that the nests arose independently, thus providing the first molecular evidence that superficial BCC is monoclonal.",

In addition, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for genetic markers in this region has been detected in sporadic BCCs, indicating that the NBCCS gene is probably a tumor-suppressor gene. In this study we have determined that the NBCCS gene is also linked to this region in Australasian pedigrees and that there is no significant evidence of heterogeneity. We have defined the localization of the gene by multipoint and haplotype analysis of 15 families, using four microsatellite markers.

Causative mutations for NBCCS occur in the PTCH1 gene on chromosome 9q22.3-q31, which encodes the principle receptor for the Hedgehog signalling pathway. We have investigated the molecular basis of craniofacial defects seen in NBCCS using a transgenic mouse model expressing Shh in basal epithelium under a Keratin-14 promoter. These mice have an absence of flat bones within the skull vault, hypertelorism, open-bite malocclusion, cleft palate and arrested tooth development. Significantly, increased Hedgehog signal transduction in these mice can influence cell fate within the craniofacial region. In medial edge epithelium of the palate, Shh activity prevents apoptosis and subsequent palatal shelf fusion. In contrast, high levels of Shh in odontogenic epithelium arrests tooth development at the bud stage, secondary to a lack of cell proliferation in this region. These findings illustrate the importance of appropriately regulated Hedgehog signalling during early craniofacial development and demonstrate that oro-facial clefting and hypodontia seen in NBCCS can occur as a direct consequence of increased Shh signal activity within embryonic epithelial tissues.",

To clarify the role of PTCH1 in OKCs, mutational analysis was undertaken in eight sporadic and four NBCCS-associated OKCs and six PTCH1 mutations were identified in two sporadic and three NBCCS-associated cases. The epithelial cell proliferation as assessed by Ki67 labeling was studied in a total cohort of 62 OKCs (42 sporadic and 20 syndromic cases) with known PTCH1 status. The epithelial Ki67 labeling in OKCs with PTCH1 mutation was significantly higher than that in cases with no PTCH1 mutation. Furthermore, OKCs harboring PTCH1 truncation-causing mutations showed an even greater Ki67 labeling index than those with non-truncation-causing mutations.

Mutations in some of these genes have been shown to cause cancer. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin is the most common cancer in humans. More than 750000 new cases are diagnosed annually, and the incidence is rising. BCCs are slow-growing, locally invasive tumors that rarely metastasize but can result in extensive morbidity through local recurrence and tissue destruction. Epidemiologic studies suggest that sunlight (particularly UVB radiation) is a strong risk factor for BCC formation, although other factors are also involved. The nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), a rare genetic disorder, is characterized by predisposition to BCCs and other tumors as well as to a wide range of developmental defects. NBCCS maps to chromosome 9q22.3, and loss of heterozygosity at this site in both sporadic and hereditary BCCs suggests that it functions as a tumor suppressor. The gene for NBCCS was recently cloned and is the human homologue of the Drosophila gene \"patched.\" Genetic studies in Drosophila show that patched is part of the hedgehog signaling pathway, which is important in determining embryonic patterning and cell fate in multiple structures of the developing embryo. Human patched is mutated in both hereditary and sporadic BCCs, and inactivation of this gene is probably a necessary, if not sufficient, step for BCC formation.

To assess this possibility, we first overexpressed ODC in the skin of Ptch1+/- mice using a keratin 6 (K6) promoter that directs constitutive ODC expression in the outer root sheath of the hair follicle. UVB irradiation of these mice accelerated induction of BCCs as compared with their Ptch1+/- littermates. To further verify the role of ODC in BCC tumorigenesis, we used an antizyme (AZ) approach to inhibit ODC activity in the Ptch1+/- mice. Ptch1+/- mice with AZ overexpression driven by the K6 promoter were resistant to the induction of BCCs by UVB. Furthermore, oral administration of the suicidal ODC inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine reduced UVB-induced BCCs in Ptch1+/- mice. These results demonstrate the crucial importance of ODC for the induction of BCCs and indicate that chemopreventive strategies directed at inhibiting this enzyme may be useful in reducing BCCs in human populations.",

Analysis of Drosophila mutants indicates that patched interacts with the hedgehog signalling pathway, repressing the expression of various hedgehog target genes including wingless, decapentaplegic and patched itself. Using single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) to screen human patched in 37 sporadic BCCs, we detected mutations in one-third of the tumours. Direct sequencing of two BCCs without SSCP variants revealed mutations in those tumours as well suggesting that inactivation of patched is probably a necessary step in BCC development.

Seven of the 10 treated lesions were completely free of basaloid cells when biopsied and two partially regressed. Two of the 7 exhibited seborrheic keratosis in the absence of basaloid cells. One of the 10 treated lesions recurred by week 10 and histologically had the appearance of a squamous cell carcinoma. No scars were visible at the healed sites of any of the successfully ablated lesions.

At the molecular level, basal cell carcinomas are characterized by aberrant activation of sonic hedgehog signaling, usually due to mutations either in the ptch or smoh genes. In addition, about half of the cases carry mutations in the tp53 tumor suppressor gene, which are often UVB-associated C-->T transition mutations.

Examination of other relatives showed that the propositus' mother also had NBCCS but was more mildly affected; in particular, she had no BCCs. This case illustrates complex gene-environment interaction, in that increased skin pigmentation in African-Americans is presumably protective against ultraviolet, but not ionizing, radiation. This case and other similar cases in the literature show the importance of considering NBCCS in the differential diagnosis of any patient who presents with a medulloblastoma, especially before the age of 5 years, and of examining other close relatives for signs of NBCCS to determine the patient's at-risk status.

The originating cells may arise from interfollicular basal cells, hair follicles or sebaceous glands, thus from a deeper zone than the SCC ones, which probably means exposure to different doses or wavelengths of UV. The p53 gene and the patched gene (PTCH) are major targets of UV for BCC induction. Mutations in p53 are present in about 56% of human BCC, even small early lesions. The \"UV signature\" is observed in 65% of them. Mutations in the PTCH play also a major role in BCC development, being responsible for hereditary BCCs in Gorlin's syndrome, sporadic BCC, and BCCs isolated from xeroderma pigmentosum, although with a lower incidence of \"UV signature\".

Most BCCs harbor inactivating mutations in the membrane receptor/gene Ptch, thereby activating the Hedgehog signaling pathway (Hh) via the essential signaling molecule Smoothened (SMO). Novel small-molecule inhibitors or antagonists of SMO have shown excellent response rates in patients with locally advanced, unresectable and metastatic BCC in roughly 35-60% of patients, with disease control rates and clinical benefit being even higher. Sonidegib is the second-in-class SMO inhibitor approved for locally advanced, unresectable and metastatic BCC. Sonidegib is given once daily continuously, with specific side effects as listed in the label indication. Resistance develops over time and knowledge gleaned from other SMO inhibitors indicates that SMO mutations preventing drug binding as well as mechanisms activating the Hh pathway downstream of SMO are responsible, ultimately reactivating Hh pathway signaling. The next challenge will be to define novel salvage and SMO combination strategies for BCC and other tumors. ",

However, previous studies have revealed that more than 85% of syndromic KCOTs and less than 30% of sporadic KCOTs harbor PTCH1 mutations. The significantly lower PTCH1 mutation rates observed in sporadic KCOTs suggest that they serve a minor role in pathogenesis. We aimed to discern the importance of PTCH1 mutations in sporadic KCOTs.;PTCH1 mutational analysis was performed with 19 new sporadic KCOT cases by direct sequencing of epithelial lining samples separated from fibrous capsules. Using this approach, we further reexamined 9 sporadic KCOTs that were previously reported to lack PTCH1 mutations by our group.;Nineteen PTCH1 mutations were detected in patient samples from 16/19 new cases (84%) all these mutations were absent in fibrous tissues and peripheral blood specimens from the same patients. We also identified four PTCH1 mutations in 3/9 patients (33%) that were previously undetected.;These data indicated that PTCH1 mutations occur in sporadic KCOTs at a higher rate than previously suspected, owing to the masking effects of the attached stromal tissues in the test samples.

Activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway underlies a number of types of common human cancers, yet little is known concerning endocrine signaling in such tumors. Here, we investigated endocrine signaling in a murine model of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin, the most common cancer. BCCs were generated by the activation of Hh signaling resulting from the specific deletion of the Ptch1 gene in the developing epidermis. Subsequently, a severe growth deficiency was observed in the murine BCC model, and we identified a deficiency of circulating IGF1 (Igf1). We demonstrate that Hh pathway activation in murine BCC induces IGF binding proteins, thereby regulating Igf1 sequestration into the skin and skewing Igf endocrine signaling. Significantly, these results show that Hh-induced tumors can have endocrine effects on normal tissues that in turn can greatly impact the host. This study not only identifies that Igf is important in Hh-associated skin tumors but also exemplifies the need to consider endocrine signaling when interpreting complex in vivo tumor models.",

Most BCCs are caused by mutational inactivation of the tumor suppressor Patched (PTCH), which results in activation of Smoothened (SMO) and of the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway. Recent studies indicate that BCC progression involves a crosstalk between Hh signaling, vitamin D derivatives and the vitamin D receptor (Vdr) signaling pathway. This has been demonstrated in BCC-bearing Ptch mutant mice and BCC cell lines, in which both vitamin D3 and its active metabolite calcitriol (1alpha-25(OH)2D3) exert antitumor effects. Interestingly, the antitumor effects are mainly ascribed to an inhibition of Hh signaling. Furthermore, as evident from studies in Vdr deficient mice, calcitriol may also repress the activity of Hh signaling in a Vdr-dependent fashion thereby establishing an additional inhibitory feedback on Hh signaling activity. In this chapter, we discuss the current understanding and controversial findings of the inhibition of Hh signaling by vitamin D derivatives and the implication of these findings for BCC carcinogenesis.",

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) is a nuclear enzyme that plays a multifunctional role in DNA damage signaling and repair. In healthy and fertile PARP-1-null mice, radiation exposure reveals an extreme sensitivity and a high genomic instability. To test for interactions between PARP-1 and sonic hedgehog signaling, PARP-1-null mice were crossed to Ptc1 heterozygous mice. PARP-1 deletion further accelerated medulloblastoma development in irradiated Ptc1(+/-) mice, showing that PARP-1 inactivation sensitizes cerebellar cells to radiation tumorigenic effects. In addition to increased formation and slowed down kinetics of disappearance of gamma-H2AX foci, we observed increased apoptosis in PARP-1-deficient granule cell progenitors after irradiation. Double-mutant mice were also strikingly more susceptible to BCC, with >50% of animals developing multiple, large, infiltrative tumors within 30 weeks of age.

To determine whether certain tumorigenic fingerprints and potentially predisposing patched (PTCH) tumor suppressor single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are distributed differently among sporadic BCC patients, we compared the PTCH mutation spectra in early-onset BCC (first lesion at age < 35 years), regular BCC (first lesion at age > or = 35 years and < 10 lesions), and multiple BCC (> or = 10 lesions). The PTCH gene was mutated in 29 of 60 cases (48%). Most of the PTCH mutations bore the UV fingerprint (i.e., C --> T or tandem CC --> TT transitions at dipyrimidine sites). However, neither the proportion nor the spectra of exonic PTCH mutations differed significantly among the three groups. A large number of SNPs (IVS10+99C/T, IVS11-51G/C, 1665T/C, 1686C/T, IVS15+9G/C, IVS16-80G/C, IVS17+21G/A, and 3944C/T or its combinations) were also detected, but again their incidence did not differ significantly among the groups. Interestingly, expression of the IVS16-80G/C and the IVS17+21G/A genotype did not achieve the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in patients with regular and/or early-onset BCC. These data suggest that a (UV-) mutated PTCH gene is important for sporadic BCC formation independent of clinical phenotype and that the IVS16-80G/C and/or IVS17+21G/A SNP site might be important for tumorigenesis in certain BCC patients.",

The population investigated comprised 126 BCC patients who were enrolled on the basis of specific criteria (multiple and/or familial BCC and/or onset before the age of 40 years and/or association with another tumor)--and 151 controls matched for ethnicity, age, and sex. MC1R variants appeared as a moderate risk factor for BCC (odds ratio (OR) for one and two variants, 2.17 [1.28-3.68] and 7.72 [3.42-17.38], respectively), independently of pigmentation characteristics (OR = 2.53 [1.34-4.8]). Interestingly, in addition to the predictable red hair color (RHC) alleles, two non-RHC alleles (V60L and V92M) were also closely associated with BCC risk (OR 3.21 [1.91-5.38] and 2.87 [1.5-5.48], respectively), which differs from the situation in the Celtic population. In addition, the PTCH c.3944C/C genotype was also associated with BCC risk (OR 1.94 [1.2-3.1]), especially in the subgroup of patients with multiple tumors (OR 2.16 [1.3-3.6]). Thus, our data show that MC1R and PTCH variants are associated with BCC risk in the French population. We further suggest that assessing MC1R and PTCH status could be useful, combined with the assessment of clinical risk factors, in identifying high-risk patients to be targeted for prevention or more rigorous surveillance.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the Sonic hedgehog pathway in the pathogenesis of the CEOT. We evaluated the protein distribution of PTCH and the transcription factors Gli1 and Gli2 within seven cases using immunohistochemistry. We also sought to confirm the findings by sequencing the PTCH1 gene from DNA extracted from the paraffin-embedded tissue of these cases. Seven cases of paraffin-embedded CEOT specimens were analyzed with immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity for Sonic hedgehog pathway proteins was evaluated using antibodies to the receptor PTCH as well as to the transcription factors Gli1 and Gli2. A keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KOT) from a 12year-old with NBCCS served as our positive control. Normal salivary gland tissue served as our negative control. PTCH gene sequencing was completed using PCR. Immunoreactivity to PTCH was seen in 6/7 cases, to Gli1 in 6/7 cases and to Gli2 in 6/7 cases. All three proteins were positive in the syndromic KOT and all proteins were negative in normal salivary tissue. Gene sequencing revealed five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of which two resulted in missense mutations. A missense mutation was also detected in the KOT. This study is the first to implicate the Sonic hedgehog pathway in the pathogenesis of the CEOT through sequencing.

BCC, the most common type of human cancer, is driven by the aberrant activation of hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Ptch, a tumor suppressor gene of Hh signaling pathway, and Smoothened play a key role in the development of radiation-induced BCCs in animal models. Epidemiological studies provide evidence that humans exposed to radiation as observed among the long-term, large scale cohorts of atomic bomb survivors, bone marrow transplant recipients, patients with tinea capitis and radiologic workers enhances risk of BCCs. Overall, this risk is higher in Caucasians than other races. People who were exposed early in life develop more BCCs. The enhanced IR correlation with BCC and not other common cutaneous malignancies is intriguing. The mechanism underlying these observations remains undefined. Understanding interactions between radiation-induced signaling pathways and those which drive BCC development may be important in unraveling the mechanism associated with this enhanced risk. Recent studies showed that Vismodegib, a Smoothened inhibitor, is effective in treating radiation-induced BCCs in humans, suggesting that common strategies are required for the intervention of BCCs development irrespective of their etiology.

Therefore, we performed methylation analysis of the PTCH promoter in a total of 56 BCCs. The sensitivity of three different methods, including direct bisulphite sequencing PCR, MethyLight and high-resolution melting (HRM), was applied and compared. We found that HRM analysis of DNA from fresh tissue [rather than formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE)] was the most sensitive method to detect methylation. Low-level methylation of the PTCH promoter was detected in five out of 16 analysed BCCs (31%) on DNA from fresh tissue but only in two (13%) samples on short-time stored FFPE DNA from the very same tumors. In contrast, we were unable to detect methylation by HRM on long-time stored DNA in any of the remaining 40 BCC samples.

Because PTCH controls its own transcription, inactivating mutations in PTCH may lead to overexpression of mutant PTCH mRNA due to loss of autoregulation. The present study is aimed at evaluating whether deregulation of PTCH mRNA expression is a general feature of BCCs of varying histological growth pattern and malignant potential. Irrespective of histological subtype, PTCH mRNA was overexpressed consistently as determined by in situ hybridization in all of the sporadic (n = 16) and hereditary (n = 20) tumors examined. PTCH expression was found in all of the tumor cells but appeared stronger in the peripheral palisading cells. PTCH mRNA was not detected in adjacent nontumor epidermal cells or in other parts of the epidermis. In the majority of tumors (20 of 36), nuclear immunostaining for p53 was found in scattered cells, whereas seven tumors completely lacked p53 immunoreactivity. Our finding of an up-regulation of PTCH mRNA levels in all of the BCCs analyzed indicates that deregulation of the PTCH signaling pathway constitutes an early rate-limiting event in BCC development.",

Microsatellite markers flanking the PTCH, SUFUH and TP53 loci at 9q22, 10q24 and 17p13, respectively, were studied for loss of heterozygosity (LOH).;PTCH mutations were found in 28 of 42 tumours (67%). Microsatellite analysis revealed LOH on 9q22 in 20 of 38 tumours investigated (53%), including 14 tumours with and six tumours without PTCH mutations. SMOH mutations were identified in four of the 42 BCCs (10%) while two tumours demonstrated mutations in SUFUH, including one missense mutation and one silent mutation. None of the BCCs showed LOH at markers flanking the SUFUH locus. Seventeen BCCs (40%) carried TP53 mutations, with only three tumours showing evidence of biallelic TP53 inactivation. TP53 mutations were present in BCCs with and without mutations in PTCH, SMOH or SUFUH. Interestingly, 72% of the TP53 alterations were presumably ultraviolet (UV)-induced transition mutations. In contrast, only 40% of the PTCH and SMOH alterations corresponded to UV signature mutations. No mutations were identified in GLI1, NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF or CTNNB1.;Our data confirm the importance of PTCH, SMOH and TP53 mutations in the pathogenesis of sporadic BCCs. SUFUH alterations are restricted to individual cases while the other investigated genes do not appear to be important targets for mutations in BCCs.",

Patients with basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin syndrome) are highly susceptible to developing many BCCs as a result of a constitutive inactivating mutation in one allele of PATCHED 1, which encodes a tumor suppressor that is a major inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling. Dysregulated Hedgehog signaling is a common feature of both hereditary and sporadic BCCs. Recently, we showed remarkable anti-BCC chemopreventive efficacy of tazarotene, a retinoid with retinoic acid receptor (RAR) beta/gamma specificity, in Ptch1+/- mice when treatment was commenced before carcinogenic insults. In this study, we assessed whether the effect of tazarotene against BCC carcinogenesis is sustained after its withdrawal and whether tazarotene is effective against preexisting microscopic BCC lesions. We found that BCCs did not reappear for at least 5 months after topical drug treatment was stopped and that already developed, microscopic BCCs were susceptible to tazarotene inhibition. In vitro, tazarotene inhibited a murine BCC keratinocyte cell line, ASZ001, suggesting that its effect in vivo is by direct action on the actual tumor cells. Down-regulation of Gli1, a target gene of Hedgehog signaling and up-regulation of CRABPII, a target gene of retinoid signaling, were observed with tazarotene treatment. Finally, we investigated the effects of topical applications of other retinoid-related compounds on BCC tumorigenesis in vivo. Tazarotene was the most effective of the preparations studied, and its effect most likely was mediated by RARgamma activation. Furthermore, inhibition of basal RAR signaling in the skin promoted BCC carcinogenesis, suggesting that endogenous RAR signaling restrains BCC growth.",

Odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) and palmar and/or plantar pits, and hypertelorism were the most frequently observed anomalies. OKCs are often the first signs of NBCCS and can be detected in patients younger than 20 years of age. However, the incidence and clinical manifestations of NBCCS in Korean individuals were found to be rather different from those of other countries. The relatively low frequency of basal cell carcinomas and falx calcification among the major criteria were two major differences.

The standard treatment for isolated lesions is surgical excision. However, when numerous surgical procedures are required over time, the patient can be left with multiple disfiguring scars. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers a non-invasive treatment option for patients with this condition, in which ionizing radiation is contraindicated. This study evaluates PDT as a treatment modality for Gorlin Syndrome and compares the treatment response of Gorlin-related basal cell carcinomas with that of the sporadic lesions.;In this un-randomized study, basal cell carcinomas in 25 Gorlin syndrome patients (with 36 lesions) and 145 sporadic patients (with 189 lesions) were treated by photodynamic therapy, using δ-5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) as a photosensitizer and 100Jcm(-2) of red light (630±15nm). The maximum thickness of the BCC was measured by 20MHz pulsed ultrasound prior to treatment and again 4-6 weeks and 12 months following treatment. The response of Gorlin syndrome lesions was compared to those in the overall sporadic population and then to a subpopulation matched as closely as possible for age, lesion thickness and site.;For both populations, the average pre-treatment BCC thickness by US was 1.5mm (overall range 0.3-5.3), and the average thickness at 4-6 weeks post-treatment was 0.5mm (overall range 0-4.3). Those BCC less than 1.5mm thick prior to treatment were significantly more likely to have no US evidence of disease at 4-6 weeks than and were more likely to be controlled at 12 months.;The average response to ALA PDT of Gorlin syndrome-related BCC closely resembles that for the sporadic population, with the same wide range of responses for a given dose.

Despite the aberrant signaling role of the Hedgehog pathway, little is known about the genetic mechanisms underlying basal cell carcinomas. Towards a better understanding of global genetic events, we have employed the Affymetrix Mapping 10K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray technique for \"fingerprinting\" genomewide allelic imbalance in 14 basal cell carcinoma-blood pair samples. This rapid high-resolution SNP genotyping technique has revealed a somatic recombination event-uniparental disomy, leading to a loss of heterozygosity (LOH), as a key alternative genetic mechanism to allelic imbalances in basal cell carcinomas. A highly conserved LOH region at 9q21-q31 was found in 13 of 14 (93%) basal cell carcinomas. Further statistical and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses confirmed that the 9q LOH was a result of uniparental disomy in 5 of 13 (38%) basal cell carcinomas. De novo mutations in the Patched 1 gene (PTCH) were found in 9 of 13 (69%) basal cell carcinomas with 9q LOH. A second important locus, containing LOH at 6q23-q27 was found in 5 of 14 (36%) basal cell carcinomas, suggesting that the presence of an additional putative tumor suppressor gene may be contributing to basal cell carcinoma development. This study shows that the rate of 9q LOH in basal cell carcinomas has been previously underestimated. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that uniparental disomy due to somatic recombination constitutes one of the mechanisms of LOH in basal cell carcinoma tumorigenesis.",

All lesions were evaluated preoperatively with an instrument measuring electrical impedance (IMP). Methods for determining transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and laser Doppler (LD) were also used. Measurements were also made in healthy skin on the contralateral side as reference. The diagnosis was confirmed by histological examination.;We found clear differences between the lesions and their reference values, using all three bioengineering techniques for NBCC and SBCC. The biophysical parameters of all types vary with anatomical location. Since most of the NBCC were located on the face and most SBCC on the trunk, their baseline impedance characteristics (i.e., impedance indices magnitude index (MIX) and imaginary part index (IMIX)) differed significantly. We therefore compared delta (a difference between the reference and tumour) MIX and IMIX of NBCC and SBCC instead of the absolute figures. We found no significant differences in TEWL, blood flow and IMP between the two types of BCC and attribute this to biological variation and electromagnetic noise.;As with LD and TEWL, definite differences in IMP were detected between healthy skin and BCC lesions. However, at this stage of development of the bioimpedance technique, we were unable to distinguish between the two types of BCC.

Curettage with electrodesiccation is a common method for treating primary BCC. However, multiple cycles are recommended and the procedure can have unsatisfactory cosmetic results (e.g. scarring and hypopigmentation). Mohs micrographic surgery has a low rate of disease recurrence but is a specialized procedure usually limited to specific indications (e.g. high-risk tumors). Cryosurgery and photodynamic therapy require multiple cycles and are associated with variable cosmetic outcomes and recurrence rates. As with any procedure, potential risks and patient quality-of-life issues need to be considered. In addition, substantial patient and healthcare provider inconvenience limit the practical utility of some modalities. Pharmacologic interventions provide another treatment option as adjunctive or monotherapy. Investigations of imiquimod, a novel immune response modifier, have indicated that this topical, noninvasive agent is safe and well tolerated and may be efficacious in the treatment of BCC. This review will highlight the role of standard treatment modalities and introduce new advances in the treatment of BCC.",

Our results show that Ptc1(neo67/+) mouse skin irradiated in early anagen is highly susceptible to tumor induction, as a 3.2-fold incidence of visible BCC-like tumors was observed in anagen-irradiated compared with telogen-irradiated mice. Microscopic nodular BCC-like tumors were also enhanced by irradiation during active hair-follicle growth phases. Interestingly, histologic examination of the tumors revealed a qualitative difference in BCC tumorigenesis depending on hair growth phase at the time of exposure. In fact, in addition to typical BCC-like tumors, we observed development of a distinct basal cell tumor subtype characterized by anti-cytokeratin 14 and anti-smooth muscle actin reactivity. These tumors showed relatively short latency and rapid growth and were strictly dependent on age at irradiation, as they occurred only in mice irradiated in early anagen phase. Examination of anatomic and immunohistochemical relationships revealed a close relation of these tumors with the follicular outer root sheath of anagen skin. In contrast, there are strong indications for the derivation of typical, smooth muscle actin-negative BCC-like tumors from cell progenitors of interfollicular epidermis. These results underscore the role of follicular bulge stem cells and their progeny with high self-renewal capacity in the formation of basal cell tumors and contribute to clarify the relationship between target cell and tumor phenotype in BCC tumorigenesis induced by radiation.",

We have previously reported data from peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with this condition, showing a significant level of spontaneous chromatid and chromosome rearrangements and an overall lengthening of the cell cycle. In this paper, we confirm this disease to be a chromosome instability syndrome from studies on fibroblasts of 5 patients. Spontaneous chromosomal rearrangements, an increased frequency of sister chromatid exchanges and a slowing of the cell cycle were found, compared to age-matched control material. There was also an increased sensitivity to aberration production by mechlorethamine in patient fibroblasts. The chromosome instability we found was not restricted to a given cell lineage, but appears to be part of the general condition of this syndrome. The recently discovered gene responsible for Gorlin syndrome, PTC (or PTCH), encodes a transmembrane protein with yet poorly known functions.

Patched (Ptc) encodes a receptor for Hh ligands and functions as a tumor suppressor. PTCH1 mutations in humans are found in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and irradiated Ptc1(+/-) mice recapitulate this phenotype. However, due to embryonic lethality associated with the Ptc1 null mutation, its normal function in embryonic and adult skin remains unknown. Here we describe the epidermal phenotypes of a spontaneous and viable allele of Ptc1, Ptc1(mes), in which the C-terminal domain (CTD) is truncated. Ptc1(mes/mes) embryos display normal epidermal and hair follicle development. Postnatal Ptc1(mes/mes) skin displays severe basal cell layer hyperplasia and increased proliferation, while stratification of the suprabasal layers is mostly normal. Interestingly, truncation of the Ptc1 CTD did not result in skin tumors. However, long term labeling studies revealed a greater than three-fold increase in label-retaining cells in the interfollicular epidermis of Ptc1(mes/mes) adults, indicating possible expansion of the epidermal stem cell compartment. Increased expression of regulators of epidermal homeostasis, c-Myc and p63, was also observed in Ptc1(mes/mes) adult skin. These results suggest that the CTD of Ptc1 is involved in regulating epidermal homeostasis in mature skin.",

The authors have therefore cultured skin fibroblasts from 5 NBCCS patients and measured their radiosensitivity in terms of clonogenic survival. Our results showed that, compared with 6 normal controls, the NBCCS cells were hypersensitive to X-rays. The average D0 (the inverse of the slope of the survival curve) for the NBCCS cells was 98 rads, compared with 142 rads for the normal controls and 44 rads for an ataxia telangiectasia (AT) strain. The average D10 values (the dose required to reduce survival to 10%) were 258, 351, and 123 rads for the NBCCS, normal, and AT strains, respectively. Unscheduled DNA synthesis measurements showed that NBCCS cells were not defective in excision repair of X-ray-damaged DNA. Pulse labeling index measurements showed that NBCCS cells were abnormally inhibited in the initiation of DNA synthesis following X-irradiation. The mechanisms underlying the radiosensitivity of NBCCS differ in several respects from those of AT.

PTCH mutations were found in 3 BCCs (33.3%) and in 5 PNETs (14%), including 1 of 5 cerebral PNETs, 2 of 15 medulloblastomas, and 2 of 17 desmoplastic medulloblastomas. The sequence changes in six of these tumors (four PNETs, two BCCs) were mutations predicted to result in truncated proteins. Missense mutations were detected in one PNET and one BCC each. In addition, novel sequence polymorphisms were found in exon 2, intron 5, intron 10, and intron 14 of PTCH. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed increased PTCH expression levels compared to nonneoplastic brain tissue and normal skin in the majority of PNETs and BCCs investigated.

The t(9;16) was the sole anomaly in one clone in two tumors and was accompanied by a second change that also affected the long arm of chromosome 9 in the third. In addition, other cytogenetically unrelated abnormal clones were also found in all three BCCs. The identification of t(9;16)(q22;p13) as a primary chromosomal abnormality in a subset of BCCs (we found it in 3 of 22 tumors) is especially intriguing against the background that the PTCH gene, which when mutated in the germ line presumably gives rise to the autosomal dominant basal cell nevus or Gorlin's syndrome, maps to chromosome band 9q22. None of the genes rearranged in the BCC-specific t(9;16)(q22;p13) translocation have been identified, but we hypothesize that the translocation represents the cytogenetic corollary of a tumorigenic recombination of PTCH with an as yet unknown gene in 16p13. If so, this would be the first time that a tumor suppressor gene causally involved in a hereditary cancer is shown to be frequently rearranged through a specific translocation in sporadic carcinomas of the same type.",

Several lines of evidence, including transgenic mice experiments, suggest that the critical cellular effect is stimulation of proliferation mediated by the transcriptional effector GLI1.

        "Doc_abstract":"Basal cell carcinoma (basalioma, BCC) is undoubtedly the most common malignant skin cancer and the most common human malignancy in general, with the continuous increase in its incidence. BCC is generally a disorder of white individuals, especially those with fair skin. UV radiation is the most important risk factor in the development of BCC. Short-wavelength UVB radiation (290-320 nm, sunburn rays) is believed to play a greater role in BCC formation than long-wavelength UVA radiation (320-400 nm, tanning rays). A latency period of 20-50 years is typical between the time of UV damage and the clinical onset of BCC. Therefore, in most cases BCC develops on chronically sun-exposed skin in elderly people, most commonly in the area of head and neck. UVB radiation damages DNA and its repair system and alters the immune system resulting in a progressive genetic alterations and formation of neoplasm. UV-induced mutations in the TP53 tumor-suppressor gene have been found in about 50% of BCC cases. The mutations that activate the Hedgehog intercellular signaling pathway genes, including PTCH, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Smoothened (Smo) play a significant role in cutaneous carcinogenesis. Epidemiologic studies demonstrate the higher incidence of the BCC in more equatorial latitudes than in polar latitudes. Other risk factors for the development of BCC include sun bed use, family history of skin cancers, skin type 1 and 2, immunosuppression, previous radiotherapy, and chronic exposure to toxic substances such as inorganic arsenic. Although rarely metastatic, its malignant nature is sometimes emphasized by the local tissue destruction, disfigurement, and even death if left untreated. Due to extremely high incidence of BCC medical professionals should be aware of the importance of the public education on the etiology of this tumor and the importance of the UV protection.",

The PTCH1 protein works as a negative regulator of the HH-signaling pathway by repressing downstream signaling by the coreceptor smoothened (SMOH). Mutations in PTCH1 lead to constitutive expression of HH target genes and a relationship between mutated PTCH1 and the most common tumor form in the Western world, Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) has been clearly established. We here show that PTCH1 is transcriptionally regulated by three independent promoters generating transcripts with alternative first exons. We demonstrate that only one of two putative Gli-binding sites that were identified in the promoter region of PTCH1 is functional, and that the transactivating Gli proteins, GLI1, Gli2 and GLI3, bind and enhance transcription through this site. Moreover, a strong repression of both basal and induced PTCH1 transcription was observed following expression of a truncated version of GLI3. Most interestingly, the upstream components in the HH-signaling cascade, Sonic HH (SHH) and SMOH, solely operate through the functional Gli-binding site because mutation of the Gli-binding site resulted in the disappearance of the enhanced transcription induced by the Gli proteins, as well as by SHH or SMOH. This finding suggests that transcriptional activation of the PTCH1 gene mediated via the HH-signaling pathway is dependent on the single functional Gli-binding site.",

This overexpression was accompanied by increased levels of the Hedgehog target gene Gli1 as well as the putative Foxf1 targets Bmi1 and Notch2 in these tumors.

The primary study variables were the demographics, treatment, and outcomes of managing KOTs in this sample. Descriptive statistics were computed.;The sample was composed of 16 patients (10 male and 6 female; mean age, 24 yr). These patients presented with 32 previously untreated KOTs. Fifteen patients with 31 KOTs consented to surgery that consisted of a total of 61 procedures during the study period. These procedures included 19 primary enucleation and curettage surgeries and 12 marsupialization procedures followed by secondary enucleation and curettage surgeries. During the course of clinical and radiographic follow-up examinations, 14 new primary and 5 persistent KOTs (refractory to enucleation and curettage surgeries) were diagnosed, of which 13 new primary KOTs and 5 persistent KOTs were treated. A total of 51 KOTs (32 primary, 14 new lesions that developed during follow-up, and 5 persistent lesions) were diagnosed, and 15 patients consented to operative treatment of 49 KOTs. Forty-eight enucleation and curettage surgeries were performed for 49 KOTs that showed effective treatment without persistence in 43 cases (90%) during a follow-up period from 2 to 20 years (mean, 7 yr). One resection was performed for a persistent KOT. The 5-year disease-free estimate after primary enucleation and curettage was 86% (95% confidence interval, 74.8-97.4). Other clinical and radiographic stigmata of the syndrome were diagnosed, including calcified falx cerebri, frontal bossing, hypertelorism, multiple basal cell carcinomas, and others.;The results of this study identify the variable expressivity of this syndrome and the favorable outcomes of marsupialization and enucleation and curettage of syndromic KOTs.",

We have analysed tumour DNA samples from 37 unrelated patients with sporadic PNETs and five medulloblastoma cell lines for PTCH mutations using an exon-by-exon single strand conformation polymorphism assay. We found three missense mutations, which affect conserved residues in transmembrane domains of the gene product and in the extracellular loop implicated in binding sonic hedgehog, one 2 bp deletion and an exon skipping splice site mutation. Most mutations were associated with the absence of the wild-type allele and were found in tumours exhibiting loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at loci flanking PTCH. The finding of LOH at 9q22-q23 in most mutated tumours while present in only three out of 26 tumours, in which a mutation was not identified, implicates PTCH as the target gene in PNETs with LOH at 9q22-q23 and deficient PTCH in the development of a subset of these tumours.

Inhibitors of this pathway that are currently in clinical trials inhibit Smo. However, mutations in Smo can result in resistance to these inhibitors. To target most BCCs and avoid acquired resistance because of Smo mutations, inhibiting the Shh-pathway downstream of Smo is critical. Attractive downstream targets would be at the level of Gli proteins, the transcriptional activators of this pathway in BCCs. Previously it has been shown that Gli1 and Gli2, when phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA), are targeted for proteosomal degradation. Here we show that PKA activation via the cAMP agonist forskolin is sufficient to completely abolish oncogenic Smo activity in vitro. In an inducible BCC mouse model due to a Smo mutation that confers resistance to current Smo inhibitors, topical forskolin treatment significantly reduced Gli1 mRNA levels and resulted in strongly suppressed BCC tumor growth. Our data show that forskolin inhibits the growth of even those BCCs that are resistant to Smo inhibitors and provide a proof-of-principle framework for the development of topically applied human skin-permeable novel pharmacologic inhibitors of oncogenic Shh-signaling through PKA activation.",

The study was an observer-blinded pilot of a single application of MAL to nBCCs, with or without the use of OPI.

A highly selective and homogeneous distribution of MAL-induced porphyrin fluorescence was seen in all nBCC tumors studied, and showed a high lesion-to-normal-tissue ratio with very little fluorescence in the surrounding normal tissue. Although it was difficult to compare quantitatively, as individual tumors in each of the different study groups varied, a definite trend of increase in relative tumor concentration of MAL-induced PpIX was observed over time, and this was enhanced when OPI was employed.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Human basal cell cancer (BCC) shows unique growth characteristics, including a virtual inability to metastasize, absence of a precursor stage and lack of tumour progression. The clonal nature of BCC has long been a subject for debate because of the tumour growth pattern. Despite a morphologically multifocal appearance, genetic analysis and three-dimensional reconstructions of tumours have favoured a unicellular origin. We have utilized the X-chromosome inactivation assay in order to examine clonality in 13 cases of BCC. Four parts of each individual tumour plus isolated samples of stroma were analysed following laser-assisted microdissection. In 12/13 tumours, the epithelial component of the tumour showed a monoclonal pattern suggesting a unicellular origin. Surprisingly, one tumour showed evidence of being composed of at least two non-related monoclonal clones. This finding was supported by the analysis of the ptch and p53 gene. Clonality analysis of tumour stroma showed both mono- and polyclonal patterns. A prerequisite for this assay is that the extent of skewing is determined and compensated for in each case. Owing to the mosaic pattern of normal human epidermis, accurate coefficients are difficult to obtain; we, therefore, performed all analyses both with and without considering skewing. This study concludes that BCC are monoclonal neoplastic growths of epithelial cells, embedded in a connective tissue stroma at least in part of polyclonal origin. The study results show that what appears to be one tumour may occasionally constitute two or more independent tumours intermingled or adjacent to each other, possibly reflecting a local predisposition to malignant transformation.",

Ptch1 heterozygous mice mimic the predisposition to BCC and MB development of patients affected by nevoid BCC syndrome that inherit a mutant Patched (Ptch1) allele. To examine the impact of genetic background on development of BCCs and other tumors we used two outbred mouse lines characterized by extremely high, carcinogenesis-susceptible (Car-S), and low, carcinogenesis-resistant (Car-R), susceptibility to skin carcinogenesis. Crosses between Ptch1(neo67/+) mice and Car-S (F1S) or Car-R mice (F1R) were exposed to ionizing radiation. F1SPtch1(neo67/+) mice were highly susceptible to radiation-induced BCCs, whereas F1RPtch1(neo67/+) mice were completely resistant, indicating that tumor penetrance can be modulated by genetic background. Development of microscopic and macroscopic BCC lesions was influenced by Car-S and Car-R genotypes, suggesting a genetic-background effect on both initiation and progression of BCC. Susceptibility was additionally increased in N2 backcross mice (Car-S x F1SPtch1(neo67/+)), showing a contribution from recessive-acting Car-S modifiers. The modifying effects of Car-S-derived susceptibility alleles were tissue specific. In fact, despite higher susceptibility to BCC induction, Car-S-derived lines had lower MB incidence compared with CD1Ptch1(neo67/+) mice. BCC-associated somatic events were not influenced by genetic background, as shown by similar rate of wild-type Ptch1 loss in BCCs from F1SPtch1(neo67/+) (93%) and CD1Ptch1(neo67/+) mice (100%). Finally, microsatellite analysis of BCCs showed Ptch1 loss through interstitial deletion. These results are relevant to humans, in which BCC is the commonest malignancy, because this model system may be used to study genes modifying BCC development.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Dysregulation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway is central to the development of certain tumor types, including medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Patched1 (Ptch1) and Suppressor of fused (Sufu) are two essential negative regulators of the pathway with tumor suppressor activity. Ptch1(+/-) mice are predisposed to developing medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma, while Sufu(+/-) mice develop a skin phenotype characterized by basaloid epidermal proliferations. Here, we have studied tumor development in Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) mice to determine the effect of compound heterozygosity on the onset, incidence, and spectrum of tumors. We found significantly more (2.3-fold) basaloid proliferations in Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) compared to Sufu(+/-) female, but not male, mice. For medulloblastoma, the cumulative 1-yr incidence was 1.5-fold higher in Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) compared to Ptch1(+/-) female mice but this strong trend was not statistically significant. Together this suggests a weak genetic interaction of the two tumor suppressor genes. We noted a few rhabdomyosarcomas and pancreatic cysts in the Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) mice, but the numbers were not significantly different from the single heterozygous mice. Hydrocephalus developed in approximately 20% of the Ptch1(+/-) and Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) but not in Sufu(+/-) mice. Interestingly, most of the medulloblastomas from the Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) mice had lost expression of the remaining Ptch1 wild-type allele but not the Sufu wild-type allele. On the contrary, Sufu as well as Gli1 and Gli2 expression was upregulated in the medulloblastomas compared to adult cerebellum in Ptch1(+/-) and Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) mice. This suggests that Sufu expression may be regulated by Hedgehog pathway activity and could constitute another negative feedback loop in the pathway.",

We have analyzed the hptc gene, postulated to be a tumor suppressor gene, in 22 BCCs from patients with the hyperphotosensitive genodermatosis xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). Patients with XP are deficient in the repair of UV-induced DNA lesions and are characterized by their predisposition to cancers in sun-exposed skin. Analysis using PCR-single-strand conformation polymorphism of the hptc gene identified 19 alterations in 16 of 22 (73%) of the BCCs examined. Only two (11%) deletions of the hptc gene were found in XP BCCs compared with >30% rearrangement observed in non-XP sporadic BCCs, and 17 of 19 (89%) were base substitutions. Among the 17 base substitutions, 11 (65%) were CC --> TT tandem mutations, and 4 (23%) were C --> T substitutions, all targeted at bipyrimidine sites. Hence, a significantly higher number (15 of 19; 79%) of UV-specific alterations are seen in XP tumors, in contrast to non-XP sporadic BCCs. Interestingly, we have found that in 7 of 14 (50%) XP BCCs analyzed, both hptc and the tumor suppressor gene p53 are mutated. Not only have our data indicated the key role played by hptc in the development of BCCs, they also have substantiated the link between unrepaired UV-induced DNA lesions and skin carcinogenesis, as exemplified by the UV-specific alterations of different genes in the same tumors.",

PTCH was recently proposed as a candidate gene for NBCCS due to its frequent mutation in basal cell carcinomas, the cancer most often associated with this syndrome. Another NBCCS-associated cancer is medulloblastoma, a common central nervous system tumor in children. Most medulloblastomas, however, occur without indication of an inherited predisposition. We have examined 24 sporadic medulloblastomas for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at loci flanking as well as within PTCH. In cases with LOH, single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing analysis were performed to determine the status of the remaining PTCH allele. Microsatellite analysis indicated LOH of PTCH in 5 of 24 tumors, and in three of these cases a mutation of the remaining allele was identified. Two of the mutations were duplication insertions, and the third consisted of a single base deletion. It is interesting that all three mutations occur in exon 17 of the PTCH gene.

The objectives of this prospective, observational, one arm study were (i) to verify in a real-life practice study the results obtained in previous clinical trials with MAL-PDT in the treatment of AK, nBCC and sBCC; (ii) to calculate the real-life cost of treatment and validate predictions from an economic evaluation model. Patients with AK and/or BCC were selected according to Belgian reimbursement criteria for treatment with MAL-PDT. Clinical response, cosmetic outcome and tolerability were assessed. MAL-PDT cost was calculated and compared to published model cost data. Data were collected from 247 patients (117 AK, 130 BCC). A complete clinical response was obtained for 83% of AK (85/102) and BCC (97/116) patients. A good or excellent cosmetic outcome was obtained for 95% of AK patients and 93% of BCC patients. Tolerability was good: only 2 patients withdrew for adverse events. Clinical results were similar to previous studies. Total cost of care per patient was euro 381 for AK, euro 318 for nBCC, and euro 298 for sBCC. Total cost per lesion was euro 58 for AK (identical to model prediction), euro 316 for nBCC and euro 178 for sBCC (both within 20% of model prediction).

Analogously, skin carcinogenesis-susceptible (Car-S) mice are elective for studies of papilloma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) induction. We previously reported a striking effect of gender on BCC induction in Ptch1(+/-) mice, with total resistance of females; likewise, Car-S females show increased skin tumor resistance relative to males. Here, we investigated the protective role of endogenous estrogen in skin keratinocyte tumorigenesis. Control (CN) and ovariectomized Ptch1(+/-) or Car-S females were irradiated for BCC induction or topically treated with chemical carcinogens for SCC induction. Susceptibility to BCC or SCC was dramatically increased in ovariectomized Ptch1(+/-) and Car-S females and restored to levels observed in males. Remarkably, progression of initially benign papillomas to malignant SCC occurred only in ovariectomized Car-S females. We explored the mechanisms underlying tumor progression and report overexpression of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha, downregulation of ERbeta and upregulation of cyclin D1 in papillomas from ovariectomized Car-S relative to papillomas from CN females. Thus, an imbalanced ERalpha/ERbeta expression may be associated with estrogen-mediated modulation of non-melanoma skin carcinogenesis, with a key role played by cyclin D1. Our findings underscore a highly protective role of endogenous estrogen against skin tumorigenesis by diverse agents in two independent mouse models of skin cancer.",

Furthermore, RMSs express increased levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and of genes and proteins known to inhibit cell proliferation, including Gadd45a and p27kip1. Taken together, the data suggest that the formation of RMSs in Ptch1 mutants is associated with the ability of tumour cells to resist apoptosis.",

The identification of the basic/translational components of Shh signaling has led to the discovery of potential mechanism-driven druggable targets and subsequent clinical trials have confirmed their remarkable efficacy in treating BCCs, particularly in patients with nevoid BCC syndrome (NBCCS), an autosomal dominant disorder in which patients inherit a germline mutation in the tumor-suppressor gene Patched (Ptch). Patients with NBCCS develop dozens to hundreds of BCCs due to derepression of the downstream G-protein-coupled receptor Smoothened (SMO). Ptch mutations permit transposition of SMO to the primary cilium followed by enhanced expression of transcription factors Glis that drive cell proliferation and tumor growth. Clinical trials with the SMO inhibitor, vismodegib, showed remarkable efficacy in patients with NBCCS, which finally led to its FDA approval in 2012.",

The main differential diagnosis of KCOT is from other odontogenic cysts and ameloblastoma. In the rare nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS, synonym: Gorlin(-Goltz)-Syndrome), however, KCOTs are frequently detected and may be the initial sign of this clinical syndrome. Podoplanin is a mucin-type transmembrane protein found in podocytes of human kidneys homologous to T1α-2. The expression of podoplanin in some other non-endothelial tissues raised our interest in studying this antibody in tissues of odontogenic origin. Recently, we reported podoplanin expression in sporadic cases of KCOT. We intended to investigate the podoplanin expression in KCOTs associated with NBCCS.;Archival paraffin embedded tissues from six KCOTs from patients with known NBCCCS were analyzed immunohistochemically with antibodies to podoplanin (D2-40) and p63.;We observed a continuous linear immunoreactivity of basal epithelial cells for podoplanin in all cases. The staining intensity was strong and did not differ from that for KCOT in previously reported sporadic cases. Strong nuclear P63 expression was detected in basal cell layers and diminished in suprabasal layers.;KCOTs exhibited enhanced podoplanin expression in a clinical setting of NBCCS. Although the biological functions of podoplanin have not yet been fully recognized, the overexpression of this protein is capable of promoting the formation of elongated cell extensions, and increasing adhesion and migration of inflammatory cells. Podoplanin expression in KCOT is possibly associated with slow invasion of the adjacent structures and the well-known frequent local tumour recurrences of this odontogenic tumour.",

A substantial proportion of breast carcinomas has recently been suggested to contain missense mutations in the human patched (PTCH) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) homologues. However, an independent study showed that the implicated mutation in SHH (H133Y) was absent in a large number of BCCs, medulloblastomas, breast, ovary and colorectal tumours.

It is characterized by developmental defects and a predisposition to the development of certain tumours, such as basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma and meningioma, and potentially fetal rhabdomyomas and embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas. This study aimed to analyse PTCH status in an NBCCS patient with fetal rhabdomyoma and to investigate whether deregulation of hedgehog signalling, as shown by altered expression of hedgehog pathway components and/or genetic imbalances, is a general finding in sporadic rhabdomyomas and rhabdomyosarcomas. The NBCCS patient had a novel PTCH germ-line mutation, 1370insT, and developed a fetal rhabdomyoma that harboured a 30 bp in-frame deletion in the second allele resulting in homozygous inactivation of PTCH. Sporadic rhabdomyomas and rhabdomyosarcomas showed overexpression of PTCH (43/43) and GLI1 (41/43) mRNA, as determined by in situ hybridization, indicating ongoing active hedgehog signalling. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a subgroup of fetal rhabdomyomas and embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas (12/34) lacking PTCH immunoreactivity. Four of nine informative fetal rhabdomyomas and embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the PTCH region with two of these (one fetal rhabdomyoma and one embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma) also showing LOH in the SUFU region. These findings suggest that haploinsufficiency for the two tumour suppressor genes PTCH and SUFU, which are both active in the same signalling pathway, may be important for tumour development.

        "Doc_abstract":"Patched1 (PTCH1) is a human tumour suppressor that acts as an HH (Hedgehog) receptor protein and is important for embryonic patterning. PTCH1 mediates its effects through SMO (Smoothened) and represses the expression of HH target genes such as the transcription factor GLI1 (glioma 1) as well as PTCH1. Up-regulation of these genes has been observed in several cancer forms, including basal cell carcinoma, digestive track tumours and small cell lung cancer. The fact that PTCH1 down-regulates its own expression via 'negative feedback' is an important feature in HH signalling, as it keeps the balance between HH and PTCH1 activities that are essential for normal development. In the present study, we provide evidence that a novel mechanism allowing PTCH1 to maintain this balance may also exist. We show that gene activation by GLI1, the transcriptional effector of the pathway, can be down-regulated by PTCH1 without involvement of the canonical cascade of HH signalling events. Specifically, the SMO antagonist cyclopamine has no appreciable effects in blocking this PTCH1-mediated inhibition. Moreover, the negative GLI1 regulator SUFU (Suppressor of Fused) was also found to be dispensable. Additionally, deletion mapping of PTCH1 has revealed that the domains encompassed by amino acids 180-786 and 1058-1210 are of highest significance in inhibiting GLI1 gene activation.

In five out of six cases, a 3 mm punch biopsy was obtained to confirm the RCM diagnosis.;Observed RCM features that allowed differentiation between nBCCs and intradermal nevi were the dermal-epidermal junction patterns, the appearance of the nests and the degree of vascularization.;This case series study demonstrates the value of non-invasive in vivo RCM imaging in routine patient care, with respect to the prospective diagnosis of clinically difficult to distinguish nBCCs and intradermal nevi. Subsequently, biopsies of benign lesions in cosmetic areas could be avoided.",

Sanger sequencing of SUFU in 23 additional PTCH1-negative Gorlin syndrome families identified a SUFU mutation in a second family. Copy-number analysis of SUFU by MLPA revealed a large heterozygous deletion in a third family. All three SUFU-positive families fulfilled diagnostic criteria for Gorlin syndrome, although none had odontogenic jaw keratocysts. Each SUFU-positive family included a single case of medulloblastoma, whereas only two (1.7%) of 115 individuals with Gorlin syndrome and a PTCH1 mutation developed medulloblastoma.;We demonstrate convincing evidence that SUFU mutations can cause classical Gorlin syndrome. Our study redefines the risk of medulloblastoma in Gorlin syndrome, dependent on the underlying causative gene. Previous reports have found a 5% risk of medulloblastoma in Gorlin syndrome. We found a < 2% risk in PTCH1 mutation-positive individuals, with a risk up to 20× higher in SUFU mutation-positive individuals.

To monitor splicing events of the PTCH gene, we designed oligonucleotide arrays on which exon probes and exon-exon junction probes as well as a couple of intron probes for the PTCH gene were placed in duplicate. Probe intensities were normalized on the basis of the total expression of PTCH and probe sensitivity. Tissue-specific regulation of AS identified with the microarrays closely correlated with the results obtained by RT-PCR. Of note, the novel exon, exon 12b, was specifically expressed in the brain and heart, especially in the cerebellum. Additionally, using these microarrays, we were able to detect disease-associated aberrant splicings of the PTCH gene in two patients with NBCCS. In both cases, cryptic splice donor sites located either in an exon or in an intron were activated because of the partial disruption of the consensus sequence for the authentic splice donor sites due to point mutations. Taken together, oligonucleotide microarrays containing exon junction probes are demonstrated to be a powerful tool to investigate tissue-specific regulation of AS and aberrant splicing taking place in genetic disorders.",

Interferon (IFN)-based therapy is quite effective in BCC treatment, but the molecular basis is not well understood. Here we report a novel mechanism by which IFNalpha mediates apoptosis in BCCs. In the presence of IFNalpha, we observed increased apoptosis in a BCC cell line ASZ001, in which PTC is null, and therefore with constitutive activation of the sonic hedgehog pathway. We demonstrate that SMO agonist Ag-1.4 mediates activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) phosphorylation, which is abrogated by IFNalpha in sonic hedgehog responsive C3H10T1/2 cells. In transient transfection experiments, we demonstrate that IFNalpha inhibits Erk phosphorylation and serum response element activation induced by expression of SMO, Gli1, PDGFRalpha and activated Raf, but not activated mitogen-activated Erk-regulating kinase (Mek), suggesting that IFNalpha targets mainly on Mek function. We further show that IFNalpha induces expression of Fas in BCC cells through interfering with Mek function. The role of the Fas-L/Fas signaling axis in IFNalpha-mediated apoptosis is demonstrated by the fact that addition of Fas-L neutralizing antibodies, just as caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK, effectively prevents IFNalpha-mediated apoptosis. Thus, our data indicate that IFNalpha-based BCC therapy induces Fas expression and apoptosis through interfering with Mek function.",

PTCH1 is a transmembrane protein believed to inhibit another transmembrane protein SMO (Smoothened), which mediates HH (Hedgehog) signalling. In this study, we analysed the biological properties of several PTCH2 splice variants. An mRNA form that lacked the last exon was abundantly expressed in all tissues examined, in contrast with the one that included it. Moreover, a transcript lacking exon 9, which is a part of a conserved sterol-sensing domain, was identified in intestine, prostate and cerebellum. In ovary, spleen, testis, cerebellum and skin, an mRNA lacking both exons 9 and 10 could also be observed. The different PTCH2 isoforms localized in the cytoplasm were capable of internalizing the N-terminal fragment of Sonic HH (Shh-N). Additionally, the PTCH2 gene was found to be a target of HH signalling. PTCH2 promoter regulation assays demonstrated that only one of the PTCH2 variants could inhibit the activity of SHH-N, whereas none was capable of inhibiting the activated form of SMO (SMO-M2) and this contrasts with PTCH1. Despite the fact that the PTCH2 isoforms lacked the ability to inhibit SMO-M2 activity, all PTCH2 variants as well as PTCH1, on co-transfection with Smo, were able to change Smo localization from being largely dispersed in the cytoplasm to the juxtanuclear region. Furthermore, the PTCH2 isoforms and PTCH1 co-localized in doubly transfected cells and an interaction between them was confirmed using immunoprecipitation assays. Using Ptch1-/- mouse cells, it was shown that the PTCH2 variants and PTCH1 differentially act to reconstitute not only the SHH but also the Desert HH-dependent transcriptional response. We conclude that in spite of their structural similarities, the PTCH2 isoforms have distinct functional properties when compared with PTCH1.",

Demographic data, age at presentation, age at diagnosis, spectrum of ophthalmic and periocular disease, treatment modalities used, and periocular deformities developed were reviewed.;Thirty-nine patients were included with age range of 5 to 72 years. Presenting clinical features included odontogenic keratocyst in 17 patients and basal cell carcinoma in 13 patients; less common presentations were with congenital malformations (n = 2), with ophthalmic associations (n = 3), and at genetic counseling (n = 4). Seventeen of the 39 patients confirmed a parental diagnosis of BCNS. Basal cell carcinoma developed in 18 of the 28 patients before the age of 30, confirming the reported early age of onset. Periocular basal cell carcinoma was reported in 24 of 39 patients (61%), with recurrent disease reported in 17 of these 24 (71%), despite a variety of treatment modalities used. Associated ophthalmic features were multiple eyelid cysts (15 patients), strabismus (9 patients), myopia (5 patients), hyperopia (7 patients), cataracts (5 patients), myelinated nerve fibers (3 patients), amblyopia (3 patients), and nystagmus and iris transillumination defects (2 patients each). All patients were involved in multidisciplinary medical care.;Patients with BCNS frequently have ophthalmic manifestations, particularly periocular basal cell carcinoma.

It is generally considered a sporadic tumour, most likely to affect fair-skinned individuals exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This chapter focusses on the approach to recognising the relatively few individuals in whom a high-risk hereditary susceptibility may be present. Gorlin syndrome is the main consideration and the gene most commonly mutated is PTCH1, a key regulator of the Hedgehog developmental pathway. Recently, loss of function of another gene in the same pathway, SUFU, has been found to explain a subset of families. Understanding the pathogenesis of familial BCCs has advanced the understanding of the biology of sporadic tumours and led to targeted therapy trials. The management of familial BCCs remains a challenge due to significant unmet needs for non-surgical treatments and a high burden of disease for the individual. Together with the prospect of advances in gene discovery and translation, these challenges highlight the need for ongoing review of at-risk and affected individuals by a multidisciplinary team. ",

These 'markers' have in common that they are all expressed in actively proliferating cells, particularly in neoplasms. The findings were compared with their expression in dentigerous and radicular cysts. While there was some variability in the reported results, probably because of technical inconsistencies and the use of different antibodies, a definite trend emerged. In general PCNA, Ki67 and p53 positivity occurred more frequently and more intensely in the OKCs, and in the syndrome-related more than the solitary, compared with the other cyst types. In the OKCs the positivity was expressed mostly in the suprabasal layers of epithelium whereas in the other cysts types it was mainly in the basal layer that positivity was observed. Other studies showed that the gene for the NBCCS (PTCH), a tumour suppressor gene, mapped to chromosome 9q22.3. PTCH gene mutation has been shown to be an important step in the pathogenesis of the OKC and was thought to have a role in the development of the sporadic as well as the syndrome-related OKCs. The 'two-hits' hypothesis was invoked in support of the view that syndrome-related basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and OKCs probably arise from precursor cells that contain an inherited 'first hit'. Only a single mutation was then required in the somatic cell to cause homozygous inactivation and neoplastic progression. Sporadic OKCs might arise from susceptible cells in which two somatic mutations or 'hits' have occurred, one of which manifests as allelic loss. The loss of tumour suppressor genes supports the view that the OKC is a benign neoplasm.",

However, only rare mutations have been found in PTCH1. We have therefore investigated GLI-dependent promoter activity and expression of hedgehog pathway components in TCC cell lines and proliferating normal urothelial cells. Normal urothelial cells cultured in serum-free medium, but not TCC lines exhibited low, but significant promoter activity under standard growth conditions. Accordingly, GLI1-3 and PTCH1 mRNAs were expressed at moderate levels, and sonic hedgehog (SHH) mRNA expression was low to undetectable. In co-transfection experiments GLI1 increased promoter activity significantly in one TCC line and further in normal urothelial cells, but less strongly in other TCC lines. Expression patterns of GLI factor mRNAs did not correlate with inducibility. No significant effects of SHH or cyclopamine on proliferation were observed, ruling out autocrine effects. However, SHH induced GLI-dependent promoter activity in normal urothelial cells. Taken together, our data suggest that the hedgehog pathway is weakly active in normal adult urothelial cells and of limited importance in TCC.",

Loss of heterozygosity for the PTCH region was found several years ago in the epithelial lining of odontogenic keratocysts, the cyst type with highly increased incidence in nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. This finding confirmed the expectations that the gene responsible for the syndrome would have a decisive role in the genesis of these cysts even when they are not syndrome related. Suggestive temporal distribution of Shh signaling, recently observed during tooth development, lead us to investigate PTCH association with dentigerous cysts, the other major noninflammatory cyst of odontogenic origin. We report here that PTCH appears to be inactivated in dentigerous cysts, suggesting that it is responsible for their genesis as well. More generally, if our similar observations of incomplete heterozygosity in this region for dermoid cysts can be interpreted as loss of heterozygosity, PTCH alterations may prove to be a necessary, and perhaps the initiating event, in formation and growth of various noninflammatory cysts. This would be consistent with our view that local PTCH inactivation can, under favorable circumstances, lead to persistent though not by itself truly aggressive cell proliferation.",

We investigated the effects of the time-point and dosage of Ptch inactivation on tumor spectrum using conditional Ptch-knockout mice. Ptch heterozygosity induced prenatally resulted in the formation of RMS, which was accompanied by the silencing of the remaining wild-type Ptch allele. In contrast, RMS was observed neither after mono- nor biallelic postnatal deletion of Ptch. Postnatal biallelic deletion of Ptch led to BCC precancerous lesions of the gastrointestinal epithelium and mesenteric tumors. Hamartomatous gastrointestinal cystic tumors were induced by monoallelic, but not biallelic Ptch mutations, independently of the time-point of mutation induction. These data suggest that the expressivity of Ptch deficiency is largely determined by the time-point, the gene dose and mode of Ptch inactivation. Furthermore, they point to key differences in the tumorigenic mechanisms underlying adult and childhood tumors.

Specific signal transduction pathways that regulate cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis are found to be corrupted in skin cancers, e.g., the epidermal growth-stimulating Hedgehog pathway in basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). Mutations in genes coding for proteins in these pathways lead to persistent disturbances that are passed along to daughter cells, e.g., mutations in the gene for the Patched (PTCH) protein in the Hedgehog pathway. Thus far only the point mutations in the P53 gene from squamous cell carcinomas and BCCs, and in PTCH gene from BCC of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients appear to be unambiguously attributable to solar UV radiation.

We were especially interested in Hh target genes (PTCH1 and GLI1), whose expression is elevated in response to Hh signaling. The microarray data demonstrated downregulation of PTCH1 expression in uninvolved and lesional skin (1.1-fold and 2-fold, respectively; P<0.0001). Additionally GLI1 mRNA was downregulated in lesional skin (1.7 fold; P<0.05). No significant changes were observed between lesional and uninvolved skin for the Hh ligands or Smoothened. Quantitative PCR confirmed these findings. In situ hybridization for GLI1 and PTCH1 was positive in basal cell carcinoma tumor cells, but was negligible in uninvolved or lesional psoriatic skin.

The histopathology comprises elements of basal cell carcinoma and trichoepithelioma with a variable degree of follicular differentiation. Both basal cell carcinoma and trichoepithelioma reveal alterations of PTCH, the human homolog of the Drosophila segment polarity patched gene. Furthermore, heterozygous PTCH knockout mice develop trichoblastoma-like tumors. This suggests an involvement of the PTCH gene in the pathogenesis of human trichoblastomas. However, trichoblastomas arising in nevus sebaceus did not show loss of heterozygosity at the PTCH locus (9q22.3) in a previous study. Sequencing of the PTCH gene and analysis of sporadic human trichoblastomas have not been performed yet. We therefore screened 10 sporadic trichoblastomas and 1 trichoblastoma arising within a nevus sebaceus for PTCH mutations. After microdissection of the tumors, single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP)/heteroduplex analysis of exons 2 to 23 of PTCH was performed, and polymerase chain reaction products with aberrant band patterns were sequenced. One trichoblastoma revealed a silent mutation at codon 562 in exon 12. Another trichoblastoma showed a somatic C > T single nucleotide substitution at codon 1,315 (exon 23), which was not present in corresponding normal epidermis. This mutation at codon 1,315 represents an already described PTCH germline polymorphism and results in a heterozygous Pro to Leu substitution in the tumor. The Pro/Leu polymorphism in germline is associated with a higher risk for breast cancer, but a potential contribution to the tumorigenesis of trichoblastoma is unknown. We detected no classical PTCH mutations in the investigated trichoblastomas. Our results indicate that PTCH mutations are not mainly involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic trichoblastomas, in contrast to basal cell carcinomas and trichoepitheliomas.

MPF activation and its subcellular localization are dependent on the phosphorylation state of its components, cdc2 and cyclin B1. In a two-hybrid screen using a bait protein to mimic phosphorylated cyclin B1, we identified a novel interaction between cyclin B1 and patched1 (ptc1), a tumor suppressor associated with basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Ptc1 interacted specifically with constitutively phosphorylated cyclin B1 derivatives and was able to alter their normal subcellular localization. Furthermore, addition of the ptc1 ligand, sonic hedgehog (shh), disrupts this interaction and allows cyclin B1 to localize to the nucleus. Expression of ptc1 in 293T cells was inhibitory to cell proliferation; this inhibition could be relieved by coexpression of a cyclin B1 derivative that constitutively localizes to the nucleus and that could not interact with ptc1 due to phosphorylation-site mutations to ALA: In addition, we demonstrate that endogenous ptc1 and endogenous cyclin B1 interact in vivo. The findings reported here demonstrate that ptc1 participates in determining the subcellular localization of cyclin B1 and suggest a link between the tumor suppressor activity of ptc1 and the regulation of cell division.

Melanin is a natural skin protective factor against UV radiation. Skin cancers associated with long-term exposure to UV radiation are: basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). The high risk of BCC development is related to acute and repeated exposure to UV causing sunburn. Molecular studies of BBC demonstrated disorders in sonic hedgehog (SHH) cell signaling regulation pathway, associated with the suppressor protein patched homolog 1 gene (PTCH1) mutations. The risk of the BCC development is related to the polymorphism of melanokortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R). Tumor P53 gene mutations observed in BCC cells has been classified as secondary genetic changes. In SCC cells UV-induced mutations were mostly related to P53 gene. Increased expression of cyclooxigenase- 2 gene (COX-2) plays a significant role in the development of SCC. Other pathogenetic factors include intensification of the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 α (IL-1α), IL-1β and IL-6). Currently, the role of UVB has been recognized in the pathogenesis of CMM. In CMM cells the following gene mutations were noted: cyclindependent kinase inhibitor 2A INK4A (p16INK4A), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), Ras, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and proto-oncogene B-Raf (BRAF). The BRAF gene mutations were observed in ~50% of CMM cases. Mutations of P53 gene are not characteristic of CMM cells.

Do raków skóry, których rozwój jest związany z długotrwałym narażeniem na promieniowanie UV, zalicza się niebarwnikowe raki skóry (non-melanoma skin cancers – NMSC) – raka podstawnokomórkowego (basal cell carcinoma – BCC) i raka kolczystokomórkowego (squamous cell carcinoma – SCC) oraz czerniaka złośliwego skóry (cutaneous malignant melanoma – CMM). Wysokie ryzyko rozwoju BCC związane jest z ostrą i wielokrotną ekspozycją na UV, powodującą oparzenia słoneczne. Badania molekularne BCC wykazały zaburzenia na szlaku regulacji sygnalizacji komórkowej sonic hedgehog (SHH), które były związane z mutacjami genu supresorowego PTCH1 (protein patched homolog 1). Ryzyko rozwoju BCC jest również związane z polimorfizmem genu receptora melanokortyny-1 (MC1R). Obserwowane w komórkach BCC mutacje genu P53 klasyfikowano jako wtórne zmiany genetyczne. W komórkach SCC mutacje indukowane UV najczęściej dotyczyły genu P53. W rozwoju SCC istotne znaczenie ma zwiększona ekspresja genu enzymu cyklooksygenazy-2 (COX-2). Innym czynnikiem patogenetycznym SCC jest nasilenie syntezy cytokin prozapalnych (czynnika martwicy nowotworu α (tumor necrosis factor α – TNF-α), interleukiny-1 α (IL-1α), IL-1β i IL-6).

All recorded carcinomas had been cured before treatment was initiated. The number of epitheliomas which developed during treatment with etretinate was compared with the number of epitheliomas recorded during the months or years preceding this treatment or during trial periods without treatment. The results obtained were very encouraging: 1. In patients with XP the actinic keratosis rapidly regressed, and the dryness of the skin was markedly reduced during the 5 years under etretinate. During the period without etretinate skin dryness and multiple actinic keratosis soon reappeared, as did, in one case, numerous basal cell carcinomas (BCC). However, etretinate did not prevent the occurrence of a malignant melanoma and of a few lesions of lentigo and naevus. 2.

Allelic deletions of the human homologue of the drosophila patched gene (PTCH) occur in both NS and BCC. To search for genetic changes in SP, a microdissection-based genetic analysis using polymorphic markers at 9q22 (PTCH; D9S15, D9S303, D9S287, D9S252) as well as markers at 9p21 flanking the tumor suppressor gene p16 (IFNA, D9S171) was performed. Glandular epithelium consisting of two rows of cells as well as adjacent normal tissue or inflammatory infiltrates in the stroma, when present, was dissected and subjected to single-step DNA extraction and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis. Two of 10 informative SP cases showed LOH at 9q22 (PTCH). Three of 7 informative SP cases showed allelic deletions at 9p21 (p16). Allelic loss at 9q22 is consistent with the clinical observation of transition of SP to BCC. The finding of frequent allelic loss at 9p21 is unlikely to be related to the rare transition of SP to metastatic adenocarcinoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"The canonical hedgehog (HH) pathway is a multicomponent signaling cascade (HH, protein patched homolog 1 (PTCH1), smoothened (SMO)) that plays a pivotal role during embryonic development through activation of downstream effector molecules, namely glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1), GLI2 and GLI3. Activation of GLIs must be tightly regulated as they modulate target genes which control tissue patterning, stem cell maintenance, and differentiation during development. However, dysregulation or mutations in HH signaling leads to genomic instability (GI) and various cancers, for example, germline mutation in PTCH1 lead to Gorlin syndrome, a condition where patients develop numerous basal cell carcinomas and rarely rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Activating mutations in SMO have also been recognized in sporadic cases of medulloblastoma and SMO is overexpressed in many other cancers. Recently, studies in several human cancers have shown that GLI1 expression is independent from HH ligand and canonical intracellular signaling through PTCH and SMO. In fact, this aberrantly regulated GLI1 has been linked to several non-canonical oncogenic growth signals such as Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), avian myelocytomatosis virus oncogene cellular homolog (C-MYC), transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) and β-catenin. Recent studies from our lab and other independent studies demonstrate that aberrantly expressed GLI1 influences the integrity of several DNA damage response and repair signals, and if altered, these networks can contribute to GI and impact tumor response to chemo- and radiation therapies. Furthermore, the ineffectiveness of SMO inhibitors in clinical studies argues for the development of GLI1-specific inhibitors in order to develop effective therapeutic modalities to treat these tumors. In this review, we focus on summarizing current understanding of the molecular, biochemical and cellular basis for aberrant GLI1 expression and discuss GLI1-mediated HH signaling on DNA damage responses, carcinogenesis and chemoresistance.

Gradually decreasing dosage levels were employed. During the initial courses of therapy, high doses (2.0-3.0 mg/kg/day) were intended as chemotherapy. In these patients only 6 of 40 (15%) lesions underwent complete clinical regression. In subsequent courses aimed at chemoprevention, the dose was progressively reduced from 1.5 to 0.25 mg/kg/day. During therapy, no new lesions were observed in the patient with the arsenical exposure. The NBCCS patient developed 1 new lesion during therapy at 1.0 mg/kg/day, 1 new lesion at 0.5 mg/kg/day and 5 new lesions at 0.25 mg/kg/day. Treatment was discontinued and the patient with the arsenic exposure developed his first new tumor 17 months afterwards; in contrast, the NBCCS patient developed 29 tumors within 13 months. These findings suggest that long-term therapy with isotretinoin is needed for the continuation of the cancer chemopreventive effect. However, the need for continuous rather than intermittent maintenance therapy, and the determination of the optimal dose for this purpose may depend on the etiology of the multiple carcinomas and on the tolerability of the lowest effective dose by the individual patient. With these encouraging data, it now appears appropriate to expand this pilot study and perform larger trials to determine the usefulness of isotretinoin in the chemoprevention of basal cell carcinoma in patients with multiple tumors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Epidemiological studies suggest that UV exposure from sunlight is the major etiology for skin cancers, both melanocytic and non-melanocytic. However, the radiation-related risk for skin cancer among atomic bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is primarily derived from the excess risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), with no demonstrable excess in squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma. The BCCs in this cohort are therefore unusual in being potentially attributable to two types of radiation-UV and ionizing (IR). BCCs have been associated with PTCH and/or p53 tumor suppressor gene alterations. To investigate the roles of these genes in relation to IR and UV exposures, we analyzed both genes in BCC samples from atomic bomb survivors. We examined 47 tumors, of which 70% had non-silent base-substitution p53 mutations independent of IR or UV exposure. However, the distribution of mutation type depends on UV and/or IR exposure. For example, C-to-T transitions at CpG sites adjacent to pyrimidine-pyrimidine (PyPy) sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-exposed than UV-shielded body areas and CpG-mutations at non-PyPy sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-shielded body areas with high-IR (>or=1 Gy) than low-IR (<0.2 Gy) exposure. And notably, although p53 deletion-frequencies demonstrated no IR-dose associations, deletions at the PTCH locus were more frequent (79% versus 44%) in tumors with high-IR than low-IR exposure. Moreover, 60% of high-IR tumors harbored both p53 and PTCH abnormalities compared with 23% of low-IR tumors. Therefore, alteration of both genes is likely to play a role in radiation-induced basal cell carcinogenesis.",

We summarize clinical features and recent progress in understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of two selected tumor syndromes, namely nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin syndrome) and Cowden syndrome. Both are autosomal dominantly inherited disorders. Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is characterized by the early onset of multiple basal cell carcinomas as as well as developmental defects and a predisposition for other benign and malignant tumors. The syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the PTCH tumor suppressor gene. Cowden syndrome is associated with pathognomonic mucocutaneous lesions, such as facial trichilemmomas, acral keratoses, and mucocutaneous papillomatosis. In addition, Cowden patients are predisposed to carcinomas of the thyroid, breast and endometrium. Cowden syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. Identification of the genes causing hereditary tumor syndromes as well as generation of genetically engineered mouse models have greatly advanced our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of these diseases. Furthermore, novel pathogenesis-based pharmacological strategies are being developed that promise to improve prevention and therapy.",

He had previously been diagnosed with basal cell naevus syndrome but had withdrawn from follow-up. His foot showed a deep ulcerating defect accompanied by profound necrosis extending to the metatarsophalangeal joints. There was a nodular skin defect over the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which was shown by histopathology to be a basal cell carcinoma, and the ulcer was bordered by a raised wall. Further physical examination revealed more than 200 dermal lesions which were identified by the dermatologist who was called in for consultation as basal cell carcinomas; multiple depressions due to abnormal local keratinisation were also seen on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. These findings led to a diagnosis of 'basal cell naevus syndrome'. The patient was treated by amputation of the lower leg followed by excision and curettage of the remaining basal cell carcinomas. At the time of the last follow-up, the patient was being checked periodically in the dermatology outpatient clinic. Basal cell naevus syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disease. The prevalence is estimated to be between 1 in 57,000 and 1 in 164,000. Basal cell naevus syndrome is generally caused by a mutation in the 'patched homolog' (PTCH)-I gene, located on chromosome 9q22.3.

The morphologic features differed significantly between these lesions and perilesional skin. However, characteristic tumor aggregates were found in only one of the three investigated nodular basal cell carcinomas (NBCCs) due to limited imaging depth.

We show that the cytosolic Tid47 molecule is a novel component of the Hedgehog (Hh)-Patched (Ptc) signaling regulating cell/tissue polarity and spatial patterning during development and is associated with human tumors such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and medulloblastoma. We provide functional evidence for its direct in vivo interaction with the Hh-bound Ptc receptor during signal transmission. Because loss of l(2)tid causes neoplastic transformation of Hh-responsive cells, we suggest that Tid47 may at least act as a guardian of the Hh signaling gradient by regulating Ptc homeostasis in the tissue. Finally, we show that the expression of htid-1, the human counterpart of l(2)tid, is altered in human BCCs.

It was later shown that Hh signaling is associated with many types of cancer, including skin, leukemia, lung, brain and gastrointestinal cancers. Another important milestone for the Hh research field is the FDA approval for the clinical use of Hh inhibitor Erivedge/Vismodegib for treatment of locally advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinomas.

        "Doc_abstract":"The prevalent keratinocyte-derived neoplasms of the skin are basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Both so called nonmelanoma skin cancers comprise the most common cancers in humans by far. Common risk factors for both tumor entities include sun-exposure, DNA repair deficiencies leading to chromosomal instability, or immunosuppression. Yet, fundamental differences in the development of the two different entities have been and are currently unveiled. The constitutive activation of the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway by acquired mutations in the PTCH and SMO genes appears to represent the early basal cell carcinoma developmental determinant. Although other signaling pathways are also affected, small hedgehog inhibitory molecules evolve as the most promising basal cell carcinoma treatment options systemically as well as topically in current clinical trials. For squamous cell carcinoma development mutations in the p53 gene, especially UV-induced mutations, have been identified as early events. Yet, other signaling pathways including epidermal growth factor receptor, RAS, Fyn, or p16INK4a signaling may play significant roles in squamous cell carcinoma development. The improved understanding of the molecular events leading to different tumor entities by de-differentiation of the same cell type have begun to pave the way for modulating new molecular targets therapeutically with small molecules.",

A nonconservative Pro/Leu nucleotide polymorphism within PTCH exon 23 at codon 1315 was recently reported to be potentially important for the development of breast epithelial cell cancers. Objectives Accordingly, the status of PTCH codon 1315 was analysed for a possible association with the development of nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) in a pilot study. Because skin cancer risk is affected by specific population-dependent phenotypes such as skin and hair colour, codon 1315 was also analysed for normal allele frequency variation in human populations having differing extents of eumelanin vs. phaeomelanin.;The single nucleotide polymorphism in codon 1315 of the human PTCH gene was analysed in genomic DNA from six different populations comprising 472 blood samples and from 170 patients in four different categories with NMSC. Polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing were used to determine the allele frequencies. Allelic loss was furthermore determined in tumours following microdissection.;The Pro/Pro genotype frequency ranged from 30% to 65% between populations, with a significant trend for a reduced frequency of the Pro/Pro genotype in populations having lighter pigmentation (P = 0.020). Pro/Pro frequency showed an increasing trend with increasing tumour case severity (P = 0.027). In 260 samples from 180 Swedish patients with NMSC and a control group of 96 healthy ethnically matched volunteers, no statistically significant pairwise differences between groups were detected in the PTCH codon 1315 allelic distribution, neither was a difference seen for multiple or early onset cases of BCC in the Swedish population. In Swedish patients with single tumours, allelic loss (loss of heterozygosity) was observed in 20 of 30 (67%) patients with BCC and four of 22 (18%) patients with SCC, with no preference in the allele lost. In contrast, the Pro/Pro genotype was frequent in seven U.S. patients having multiple independent BCCs. One of these patients was heterozygous, enabling allelic loss studies. Of 20 independent tumours, 11 had lost an allele; 10 of the 11 had lost Leu, suggesting nonrandom loss that favoured retention of Pro (P = 0.0059).;Our results indicate an association between the eumelanin-to-phaeomelanin shift and a shift from the Pro/Pro genotype to Leu-containing genotypes. Failure to lose Pro during the shift to phaeomelanin may be associated with an increased population risk for BCC and increased individual risk for multiple BCC. During development of a tumour, the effect of Pro may be magnified by loss of the Leu allele.",

Depending on the challenge and the context, constitutively expressed COX-1 or the transiently induced COX-2 isoform are of relevance. Moreover, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of skin is a prominent example of epithelial neoplasia that consistently overexpresses COX-2 in the parenchyme and the mesenchyme of premalignant and malignant lesions, while COX-1 expression remains unaltered. Pharmacological, clinical, and experimental animal studies as well as a few epidemiological studies document the importance of PG signaling in non-melanoma skin cancer including SCC and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in humans and mice. Increased levels of PGE(2) and PGF(2α) in premalignant and/or malignant epithelial skin cancers are due to the constitutive upregulation of enzymes involved in PG biosynthesis, such as COX-2, and downregulation of the tumor suppressor gene 15-hydroxy-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), which is involved in the inactivation of PG, thus counteracting the activities of COX. Most remarkably, genetic studies show that mice which are deficient in COX-2 or COX-1 are protected from the development of SCC when applying the multi-stage chemical carcinogenesis protocol. Conversely, the forced overexpression of COX-2 in the proliferative basal compartment of the stratified skin epidermis results in spontaneous hyperplasia and dysplasia in transgenic mice and furthermore a sensitization for cancer development by conferring an auto-promoted skin phenotype. In multi-stage carcinogenesis, it also becomes clear that aberrant COX-2 overexpression and activity are causally involved in tumor promotion and tumor progression rather than initiation. In contrast, using as inducer of carcinogenesis the complete carcinogen UV B light, depletion of COX-2 but not of COX-1 makes mouse skin resistant for SCC, indicating that here, only COX-2 is essential. Depending on the type of challenge, COX-2-dependent signaling contributes to the pre-invasive growth of the skin epidermis by a delayed onset of terminal differentiation, or stimulation of hyperproliferation and survival. With respect to BCC, the genetic ablation of COX-2 but also of COX-1 leads to a strongly reduced tumor burden in the skin of Patched (Ptch)1(+/-) mice, which due to the deletion of a Ptch1 allele, spontaneously develop BCC resembling human familial basal cell nevus syndrome and sporadic BCC. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the COX-2-selective inhibitors (COXibs) exhibit impressive efficacy inhibiting tumor burden in various mouse models of SCC and BCC. Most importantly, in humans the interruption of COX-2 signaling is an effective strategy to treat and chemo-prevent non-melanoma skin cancer in individuals who are at high risk for the disease. However, any potential beneficial effect of this medicine has to be balanced against the adverse effects that are known to be associated with these drugs in a subset of patients.",

Although there were lesions that were likely to be dentigerous cysts based on radiographic findings, one of them was KCOT.

        "Doc_abstract":"Exposition of the skin with solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) is the main cause of skin cancer development. The consistently increasing incidences of melanocytic and nonmelanocytic skin tumors are believed to be at least in part associated with recreational sun exposure. Epidemiological data indicate that excessive or cumulative sunlight exposition takes place years and decades before the resulting malignancies arise. The most important defense mechanisms that protect human skin against UV radiation involve melanin synthesis and active repair mechanisms. DNA is the major target of direct or indirect UV-induced cellular damage. Low pigmentation capacity in white Caucasians and rare congenital defects in DNA repair are mainly responsible for protection failures. The important function of nucleotide excision DNA repair (NER) to protect against skin cancer becomes obvious by the rare genetic disease xeroderma pigmentosum, in which diverse NER genes are mutated. In animal models, it has been demonstrated that UVB is more effective to induce skin cancer than UVA. UV-induced DNA photoproducts are able to cause specific mutations (UV-signature) in susceptible genes for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). In SCC development, UV-signature mutations in the p513 tumor suppressor gene are the most common event, as precancerous lesions reveal approximately 80% and SCCs > 90% UV-specific p53 mutations. Mutations in Hedgehog pathway related genes, especially PTCH1, are well known to represent the most significant pathogenic event in BCC. However, specific UV-induced mutations can be found only in approximately 50% of sporadic BCCs. Thus, cumulative UVB radiation can not be considered to be the single etiologic risk factor for BCC development. During the last decades, experimental animal models, including genetically engineered mice, the Xiphophorus hybrid fish, the south american oppossum and human skin xenografts, have further elucidated the important role of the DNA repair system in the multi-step process of UV-induced melanomagenesis. An increasing body of evidence now indicates that nucleotide excision repair is not the only DNA repair pathway that is involved in UV-induced tumorigenesis of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. An interesting new perspective in DNA damage and repair research lies in the participation of mammalian mismatch repair (MMR) in UV damage correction. As MMR enzyme hMSH2 displays a p53 target gene, is induced by UVB radiation and is involved in NER pathways, studies have now been initiated to elucidate the physiological and pathophysiological role of MMR in malignant melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer development.",

GLI encodes a zinc finger protein that is activated by Sonic Hedgehog signaling. Mutations in this pathway induce GLI expression in basal cell carcinoma, and expression of GLI in mice is sufficient to induce these skin tumors. We used microarrays to identify transcripts regulated by GLI or c-MYC after retroviral transduction and short-term culture of epithelial RK3E cells. Although each of these oncogenes induces malignant transformation of RK3E, two distinct sets of genes were identified. Of approximately 17,500 transcripts represented on the microarrays, GLI up-regulated the expression of 158 and repressed the expression of 52. In contrast, transcripts regulated by c-MYC were mainly repressed (424 of 682 regulated transcripts). Transcripts induced by the GLI transgene are likewise expressed in association with endogenous GLI in Ptch-deficient murine fibroblasts or in human skin tumors, but are not up-regulated in RK3E cells transformed by c-MYC, KLF4, or HRAS1. Unlike these other oncogenes, GLI induced the expression of mesenchymal cell markers including Snail, a zinc finger protein implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition in development and during tumor progression. A novel GLI-estrogen receptor fusion protein rapidly induced Snail mRNA expression in a manner like Ptch, a known direct transcriptional target gene. Induction of Snail expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by GLI may account for certain histopathological features of basal cell carcinoma, such as the absence of a well-defined, intraepithelial precursor lesion. In addition, consistent expression of the newly identified GLI-induced transcripts within GLI-expressing tumors in vivo indicates that oncogene-specific transcriptional profiles may be useful diagnostic tools for analysis of human tumors.",

A total of 65 tissue samples of solitary non-recurrent KOTs, solitary recurrent KOTs, KOTs associated with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) and KOTs with chondroid wall were studied by immunohistochemistry, using anti-SP, anti-NK-1R and anti-Ki-67 monoclonal antibodies. Expression of these markers was analysed in infiltrating lymphocytes, in fibrous capsule, and in membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus of epithelial cells. SP expression in infiltrating lymphocytes was significantly associated with SP in fibrous capsule and epithelial cells. KOTs associated with NBCCS showed a significantly higher SP expression in all tissues and cell compartments compared with other KOT types. Finally, SP expression in epithelial cells was associated with positive Ki-67 expression in dysplastic epithelium. This first published report on SP and NK-1R expressions in KOTs demonstrates that actions of the SP/NK-1R complex may constitute a mechanism to stimulate epithelial cell proliferation in KOT. This pathway may be of special relevance in the multiple KOTs associated with NBCCS.",

Of interest, arsenic trioxide or bromo and extra C-terminal inhibitors impact signals downstream to SUFU, making this aberration conceivably druggable. His tumor has initially been managed with chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) and subsequent radiation therapy is planned.;The pathogenesis of Merkel cell carcinoma is multifactorial, and related to ultraviolet radiation exposure, immunosuppression, and Merkel cell polyomavirus.

Nineteen Bowen's disease (BD) and 15 basal cell carcinoma (BCC) lesions were submitted to 6-h topical and occlusive 20% 5-ALA plus DMSO and EDTA, and later were exposed to 630 nm diode laser, 100 or 300 J cm(-2) dose.

Activating germline or somatic mutations of genes encoding Hh pathway components are found in Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and Medulloblastoma (MB). Ligand-dependent Hedgehog hyperactivation, due to autocrine or paracrine mechanisms, is also observed in a large number of malignancies of the breast, colon, skin, bladder, pancreas and other tissues. The key tumorigenic role of Hedgehog has prompted effort aimed at identifying inhibitors of this signaling. To date, only the antagonists of the membrane transducer Smo have been approved for therapy or are under clinical trials in patients with BCC and MB linked to Ptch or Smo mutations. Despite the good initial response, patients treated with Smo antagonists have eventually developed resistance due to the occurrence of compensating mechanisms. Furthermore, Smo antagonists are not effective in tumors where the Hedgehog hyperactivation is due to mutations of pathway components downstream of Smo, or in case of non-canonical, Smo-independent activation of the Gli transcription factors. For all these reasons, the research of Hh inhibitors acting downstream of Smo is becoming an area of intensive investigation. In this review we illustrate the progresses made in the identification of effective Hedgehog inhibitors and their application in cancer, with a special emphasis on the newly identified downstream inhibitors. We describe in detail the Gli inhibitors and illustrate their mode of action and applications in experimental and/or clinical settings. ",

There are approximately 15 cases diagnosed in the Czech Republic each year. The recent World Health Organization classification recognizes several histopathological subtypes of medulloblastoma: classical, desmoplastic/ nodular with its extensive-nodularity variant, and anaplastic/ large-cell variant. Further molecular analysis identified four basic subgroups of medulloblastoma: WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4. The subgroup of SHH meduloblastoma is associated with somatic mutations of SHH, PTCH1, SUFU, SMO and TP53, while the most common mutations found in infants up to three years of age were PTCH1 and SUFU. The majority of medulloblastomas are sporadic diseases, whereas only about 5- 10% of all cases occur in connection with hereditary genetic syndromes.;We present a case of a 21-months old girl diagnosed with a localized posterior fossa tumor. The histopathological examination revealed a desmoplastic/ nodular medulloblastoma. The treatment comprised a radical exstirpation of the tumor followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. With the use of array-CGH, a partial biallelic deletion of the SUFU gene (locus 10q24.32) was detected in the tumor DNA, whereas a monoallelic deletion was found in the peripheral lymphocyte DNA of the patient. These findings were confirmed by an independent qPCR method. Monoallelic germline deletion of SUFU was also identified in the patients mother, who was a healthy carrier. Pedigree of the family suggested a transition of the germline deletion of SUFU, since another brain tumors (including one case diagnosed before the age of three years) were identified in previous generations.;Germline mutations in SUFU gene are believed to predispose to infant desmoplastic/ nodular medulloblastomas, basal cell carcinomas and meningiomas. The susceptibility gene shows autosomal dominant inheritance with an incomplete penetrance. There is no evidence-based surveillance strategy suggested for the carriers of germline SUFU mutations/ deletions so far. Our recommendation is based both on a family history of our patient and similar cases described in the literature. Since the germinal mutations in SUFU are responsible for up to 50% of all desmoplastic medulloblastomas in children under three years of age, genetic testing of SUFU should be encouraged in this population of patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Pattern formation and morphogenesis depend on the careful execution of complex genetic programs, which are conserved in multicellular organisms. An important signal in some of these programs in Drosophila and vertebrates is the secreted Hedgehog (Hh) protein, which primarily functions as an inducer of morphogenetic signals. The Hh signal plays a decisive role in such critical developmental processes as neurulation and somite and limb formation. The Hh signalling pathway exhibits a novel mechanism of signal reception and transduction. In the absence of the Hh signal, the membrane protein Patched (Ptc) represses the constitutive signalling activity of a second membrane protein, Smoothened (Smo), by virtue of its ability to form a Ptc-Smo complex. Hence, mutations within the ptc gene that result in the failure of Ptc to inhibit Smo lead to constitutive activity of the Hh signalling pathway and to cancer, such as basal cell carcinoma. For activation of Hh-target genes, the N-terminal signalling domain of Hh binds to the Ptc-Smo receptor complex to activate two parallel signalling pathways. Furthermore, Hh limits its own range of action by impeding its diffusion through (i) covalent linkage of its N-terminal signalling moiety to cholesterol, mediated by the cholesterol transferase activity of its C-terminal moiety, and (ii) induction of, and sequestration by, its antagonist, Ptc.",

A group of 6 pericoronal follicles (G3) was included as a normal odontogenic tissue control.;Significant differences between the G3 and G1/G2 groups regarding the expression of MMP-1, MMP-9 (in connective tissue), and Ki-67 were observed. In KCOT, there was a positive correlation between the Ki-67 antigen and MMP-1 and between MFs and MMP-1 in the parenchyma. No statistical differences were found between G1 and G2 groups.;MMP-1, MMP-9, and proliferative activity appear to play important roles in KCOT pathogenesis. The increased proliferative activity with KCOT was associated with elevated MMP-1 production in the parenchyma, which influenced the growth of the lesion in association with an increased number of MFs.",

They may be associated with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), and may exhibit disorders involving the extracellular matrix. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunolocalisation of laminin-1 in 20 cases of KOTs in order to contribute to the characterization of this protein, which is little studied in odontogenic tumors. Our results showed laminin-1 in all 20 KOTs studied; its labelling intensity was weak in three cases (15%), moderate in five (25%) and strong in 12 cases (60%). Laminin-1 immunolocalisation was predominantly continuous in 18 (90%) KOTs, including areas of acanthosis, subepithelial split and epithelial buds. Weak immunolabelling was observed in regions exhibiting an inflammatory process, especially in the case of intense inflammation. These findings suggest that laminin-1 does not participate in biological processes such as cystic epithelium-cystic wall separation or the formation of epithelial islands in KOTs. Furthermore, the discontinuous and weak labelling of this protein in the basement membrane of these tumors is probably a consequence of the inflammatory process in the tumor stroma.",

The serpentine protein Smoothened (Smo) is essential for cells to respond to the Hedeghog (Hh) signal; oncogenic forms of Smo have been isolated from human basal cell carcinomas. Despite similarities with ligand binding G-protein coupled receptors, the molecular basis of Smo activity and its regulation remains unclear. In non-responding cells, Smo is suppressed by the activity of another multipass membrane spanning protein Ptc, which acts as the Hh receptor. In Drosophila, binding of Hh to Ptc has been shown to cause an accumulation of phosphorylated Smo protein and a concomitant stabilisation of the activated form of the Ci transcription factor. Here, we identify domains essential for Smo activity and investigate the sub-cellular distribution of the wild type protein in vivo. We find that deletion of the amino terminus and the juxtamembrane region of the carboxy terminus of the protein result in the loss of normal Smo activity. Using Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and horseradish peroxidase fusion proteins we show that Smo accumulates in the plasma membrane of cells in which Ptc activity is abrogated by Hh but is targeted to the degradative pathway in cells where Ptc is active. We further demonstrate that Smo accumulation is likely to be a cause, rather than a consequence, of Hh signal transduction.",

The current standard of care is visual inspection by physicians and/or dermatologists, followed by skin biopsy and pathologic confirmation. We have investigated the use of in vivo fluorescence imaging using fluorocoxib A as a molecular probe for early detection and assessment of skin tumors in mouse models of NMSC. Fluorocoxib A targets the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme that is preferentially expressed by inflamed and tumor tissue, and therefore has potential to be an effective broadly active molecular biomarker for cancer detection. We tested the sensitivity of fluorocoxib A in a BCC allograft SCID hairless mouse model using a wide-field fluorescence imaging system. Subcutaneous allografts comprised of 1000 BCC cells were detectable above background. These BCC allograft mice were imaged over time and a linear correlation (R(2) = 0.8) between tumor volume and fluorocoxib A signal levels was observed. We also tested fluorocoxib A in a genetically engineered spontaneous BCC mouse model (Ptch1(+/-) K14-Cre-ER2 p53(fl/fl)), where sequential imaging of the same animals over time demonstrated that early, microscopic lesions (100 μm size) developed into visible macroscopic tumor masses over 11 to 17 days. Overall, for macroscopic tumors, the sensitivity was 88% and the specificity was 100%. For microscopic tumors, the sensitivity was 85% and specificity was 56%. These results demonstrate the potential of fluorocoxib A as an in vivo imaging agent for early detection, margin delineation and guided biopsies of NMSCs. ",

Abnormal activities of Shh signaling pathway have been implicated in tumorigenesis such as basal cell carcinomas and medulloblastomas. Here we show that Shh signaling negatively regulates prostatic epithelial ductal morphogenesis. In organotypic cultures of developing rat prostates, Shh inhibited cell proliferation and promoted differentiation of luminal epithelial cells. The expression pattern of Shh and its receptors suggests a paracrine mechanism of action. The Shh receptors Ptc1 (Patched1) and Ptc2 were found to be expressed in prostatic stromal cells adjacent to the epithelium, where Shh itself was produced. This paracrine model was confirmed by co-culturing the developing prostate in the presence of stromal cells transfected with a vector expressing a constitutively active form of Smoothened, the real effector of the Shh signaling pathway. Furthermore, expression of activin A and TGF-beta1 that were shown previously to inhibit prostatic epithelial branching was up-regulated following Shh treatment in the organotypic cultures. Taken together, these results suggest that Shh negatively regulates prostatic ductal branching indirectly by acting on the surrounding stromal cells, at least partly via up-regulating expression of activin A and TGF-beta1.",

Besides genes, non-coding transcripts as microRNAs (miRNAs) gained increasing relevance in the last decade. To understand the regulatory processes of miRNAs on genes, integrative computer-aided approaches are essential, especially in the light of complex human diseases as cancer.;Here, we present miRTrail, an integrative tool that allows for performing comprehensive analyses of interactions of genes and miRNAs based on expression profiles. The integrated analysis of mRNA and miRNA data should generate more robust and reliable results on deregulated pathogenic processes and may also offer novel insights into the regulatory interactions between miRNAs and genes. Our web-server excels in carrying out gene sets analysis, analysis of miRNA sets as well as the combination of both in a systems biology approach. To this end, miRTrail integrates information on 20.000 genes, almost 1.000 miRNAs, and roughly 280.000 putative interactions, for Homo sapiens and accordingly for Mus musculus and Danio rerio. The well-established, classical Chi-squared test is one of the central techniques of our tool for the joint consideration of miRNAs and their targets. For interactively visualizing obtained results, it relies on the network analyzers and viewers BiNA or Cytoscape-web, also enabling direct access to relevant literature. We demonstrated the potential of miRTrail by applying our tool to mRNA and miRNA data of malignant melanoma. MiRTrail identified several deregulated miRNAs that target deregulated mRNAs including miRNAs hsa-miR-23b and hsa-miR-223, which target the highest numbers of deregulated mRNAs and regulate the pathway \"basal cell carcinoma\". In addition, both miRNAs target genes like PTCH1 and RASA1 that are involved in many oncogenic processes.;The application on melanoma samples demonstrates that the miRTrail platform may open avenues for investigating the regulatory interactions between genes and miRNAs for a wide range of human diseases. Moreover, miRTrail cannot only be applied to microarray based expression profiles, but also to NGS-based transcriptomic data.

Redesignation of the OKC as the KCOT by the World Health Organization (WHO) is based on the well-known aggressive behaviour of this lesion, its histology and new information regarding its genetics. Abnormal function of PTCH, a tumour suppressor gene, is noted to be involved in both nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome and sporadic KCOTs. Normally, PTCH forms a receptor complex with the oncogene SMO for the SHH ligand. PTCH binding to SMO inhibits growth-signal transduction. SHH binding to PTCH releases inhibition of the signal transduction pathway. If normal functioning of PTCH is lost, the proliferation-stimulating effects of SMO are permitted to predominate. A review of the literature was conducted and results were tabulated to determine whether treatment modality is related to recurrence rate. More aggressive treatment - resection or enucleation supplemented with Carnoy\"s solution with or without peripheral ostectomy - results in a lower recurrence rate than enucleation alone or marsupialization. Notably, the recurrence rate after marsupialization followed by enucleation is not significantly higher than that following the so-called aggressive modalities. Our case series consists of 21 patients treated for KCOTs. Results were organized to demonstrate recurrence as it relates to size of lesion and time since treatment and incidence as it relates to patient age and location in the jaws. In our series, the average KCOT surface area measured radiographically was 14 cm<sup>2</sup>. Most lesions were within the 0-15 cm<sup>2</sup> range and lesions in this range resulted in the greatest number and proportion of recurrences. The recurrence rate of 29% in our case series was consistent with previously established data; all recurrences occurred within 2 years post-intervention. The incidence of primary lesions was highest in the age group 70-79 years; most lesions occurred in the posterior mandible. WHO\"s reclassification of the OKC as the KCOT based on behaviour, histology and genetics underscores the aggressive nature of the lesion and should motivate clinicians to manage the disease in a correspondingly aggressive manner. The most effective interventions for the KCOT are either enucleation with Carnoy\"s solution, or marsupialization with later cystectomy. Future treatment may involve molecular-based modalities, which may reduce or eliminate the need for aggressive surgical management.",

Molecular studies have shown high frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in some specific chromosome regions, but LOH on chromosome 9 in HCC has not been thoroughly investigated. In our investigation of chromosome 9 with 19 polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)-based polymorphic microsatellite markers, 30 of 48 HCC tissue samples (63%) had LOH, and a distinct common deletion region and a region of loss were identified. The first region was located at the 9p21 region and the minimal deletion region was located between loci D9S1747 and D9S1748. This is a region of approximately 200 kb which includes the p16 tumor-suppressor gene. A region of loss was located on 9p13 to 9q33. The putative tumor-suppressor gene for nevoid-basal-cell-carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) at 9q22.3 resides within this region. In addition to LOH, 4 HCC cases showed possible homozygous deletions at 9p21 with markers D9S1748, D9S1752 and D9S171 by multiplex PCR analysis. In 3 cases, the minimal region of possible homozygous deletion was approximately 300 kb and was defined between markers D9S1747 and D9S1752. Since this deletion region includes both the p15 and the p16 tumor-suppressor genes, these genes were possibly inactivated by homozygous deletion in HCC. In addition, a second region of possible homozygous deletion was present on the centromeric side of 9p21. However, these changes are not associated with age, gender, size or tumor-cell differentiation. Our data also suggest that inactivation of the p16 and the p15 genes and the possibility of other unknown tumor-suppressor genes located on these defined deleted regions of chromosome 9 may be involved in the pathogenesis of HCC.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma are the rare progeny of precancerous lesions that usually remain stable or regress. For SCC the sequence appears to include TP53 mutant clones in normal skin; dysplasia; carcinoma in situ; and SCC. When such lesions are contiguous, their TP53 mutations are consistent with a single clonal lineage. The set of TP53 mutations in tumours is more restricted than in precancers, suggesting additional selection. Melanoma lies at the end of a continuum including mole, dysplastic naevus, radial growth melanoma and vertical growth. The genetics of melanoma is less clear. Basal cell carcinomas seem to arise without a precancer and contain mutations in TP53 and PTCH. Childhood sunlight exposure directs the location and frequency of precancers. For melanoma, its effects on intermittently exposed body sites are superimposed on the effect at sites chronically exposed. SCC precancers and tumours, BCC tumours and melanoma cell lines contain UV induced mutations. Sun exposed skin of normal individuals contains thousands of small clones of TP53 mutated cells. Predisposition to sunlight induced precancer is a multigenic trait involving factors such as hair and skin color, DNA repair proficiency and mole type and number. These each contribute a relative risk on the order of two to four. Familial predisposition to dysplastic naevi carries a larger risk. The cell of origin for melanoma is uncontroversial, and the proposed hair follicle origin of BCC is consistent with the presence of stem cells in the bulge region. The origin of SCCs and the arrangement of interfollicular stem cell compartments are less clear. Clonal expansion of the initial mutated cell may also be driven by sunlight. When a mutation confers apoptosis resistance, as TP53 mutations do, subsequent UV exposure will be more likely to kill normal cells than mutants. The latter can expand into a clone, only one cell of which need be mutated again. Immunosuppressant drugs may have the same effect as UV, facilitating the clonal expansion of precancers. In the absence of exogenous influences, mutant clones and precancers tend to regress. There is little evidence that regression of precancers is immunological, though regression of melanoma appears to be. The chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU causes regression of dysplasias by removing initiated cells, perhaps by enhancing apoptosis. In contrast, retinoic acid temporarily suppresses clonal expansion. Most sunscreens are mutagenic, with as yet unknown consequences. Mice develop dysplasias and SCCs after UV irradiation. Initiation and clonal expansion of dysplasias is UV driven, but conversion to SCC and subsequent growth involve spontaneous events. With chemical carcinogens mice develop papillomas that usually regress and thus are precancers. Tumour promotion yields abundant low risk papillomas that contain Hras1 mutations but rarely progress to SCC. High risk papillomas are infrequent but do convert to SCC, particularly if re-treated with mutagens. Conversion to SCC is associated with TP53 mutations. The mechanisms of multiple mutation and clonal expansion observed in human and mouse systems, respectively, are beginning to converge into a coherent understanding of precancerous events in skin.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Aberrant activation of Hedgehog (HH) signaling has been identified as a key etiologic factor in many human malignancies. Signal strength, target gene specificity, and oncogenic activity of HH signaling depend profoundly on interactions with other pathways, such as epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated signaling, which has been shown to cooperate with HH/GLI in basal cell carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. Our experimental data demonstrated that the Daoy human medulloblastoma cell line possesses a fully inducible endogenous HH pathway. Treatment of Daoy cells with Sonic HH or Smoothened agonist induced expression of GLI1 protein and simultaneously prevented the processing of GLI3 to its repressor form. To study interactions between HH- and EGF-induced signaling in greater detail, time-resolved measurements were carried out and analyzed at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels. The Daoy cells responded to the HH/EGF co-treatment by downregulating GLI1, PTCH, and HHIP at the transcript level; this was also observed when Amphiregulin (AREG) was used instead of EGF. We identified a novel crosstalk mechanism whereby EGFR signaling silences proteins acting as negative regulators of HH signaling, as AKT- and ERK-signaling independent process. EGFR/HH signaling maintained high GLI1 protein levels which contrasted the GLI1 downregulation on the transcript level. Conversely, a high-level synergism was also observed, due to a strong and significant upregulation of numerous canonical EGF-targets with putative tumor-promoting properties such as MMP7, VEGFA, and IL-8. In conclusion, synergistic effects between EGFR and HH signaling can selectively induce a switch from a canonical HH/GLI profile to a modulated specific target gene profile. This suggests that there are more wide-spread, yet context-dependent interactions, between HH/GLI and growth factor receptor signaling in human malignancies.",
