        "Doc_abstract":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) represents an example of tumour with high incidence of oncogenic sequences, such as RET/PTC and Trk. Both of them arise from the fusion of 3' terminal sequences of TK domain of RET or NTRK1 gene, respectively, with 5' terminal sequences of their activating genes. In case of NTRK1 oncogene, several rearrangement types are observed, characteristic for PTC: Trk (TMP3), Trk-T1, Trk-T2, Trk-T3 and Trk-2h, observed in human breast cancer cell line. Studies from different geographical regions, revealed significant population differences in the incidence of Trk rearrangements (0-50%), while within the same population, the frequency of Trk in spontaneous and radiation-associated PTCs is similar. The results of studies, focused on the correlation between tumour genotype and the histopathological type of tumour, involving cases of both RET/PTC and Trk rearrangements in PTC, are not unequivocal. In many studies, no correlation was observed between the presence of RET and/or NTRK1 rearrangement and such parameters, as patient's age at diagnosis, gender, histopathological type of tumour or clinical stage (TNM stage grouping), although the earliest clinical symptoms and the worst disease outcomes were observed for RET/NTRK1 rearrangement positive tumours. Differences in the rearrangement incidence between male and female patients were associated with the latency period of radiation-associated tumours, being significantly lower in women. In general, it is assumed that oncogenic Trk sequences are typical for the spontaneous type of PTC.",

Oncogenic fusion of the NTRK1 tyrosine kinase domain with the amino-terminal part of the tropomyosin gene (TPM3/NTRK1, trk) was observed in 5 tumors. A single tumor exhibited a TPR/NTRK1 fusion (TRK-T2).

The method of DD analysis was refined by a novel fragment-recovery technique using a high-performance fluorescence scanner.;Of 500 up- or down-regulated mRNA transcripts, 19 selected fragments were recovered, cloned, sequenced, and identified. The accuracy and high degree of reproducibility of the method was demonstrated. Differential expression of gene products with potential association to cell proliferation or tumor progression was observed, such as 14-3-3beta and Rab27a. Moreover, several gene products with unknown functions were demonstrated in PTCs bearing RET or NTRK1 hybrids versus rearrangement-negative PTCs, including a homologue of the Ig kappa light chain constant region.;Candidate transcripts with presumed tumorigenic potential in other solid tumors may prove to be relevant in the progression of PTCs, too. Most promising is the isolation of several differentially expressed, yet unknown, genes that may open new insights in the pathogenesis or progression of PTC.",

These rearrangements result in the formation of chimaeric genes composed of the tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK1 fused to 5' sequences of different genes. To investigate if the NTRK1 gene plays a role in radiation-induced thyroid carcinogenesis, we looked for the presence of NTRK1-activating rearrangements in 32 human thyroid tumours (16 follicular adenomas, 14 papillary carcinomas and two lymph-node metastases of papillary thyroid carcinomas) from patients who had received external radiation, using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Southern blot and direct sequencing techniques. These data were compared with those obtained in a series of 28 'spontaneous' benign and malignant thyroid tumours, collected from patients without a history of radiation exposure and four in vitro culture cell lines derived from 'spontaneous' thyroid cancers. Our results concerning the radiation-associated tumours showed that only rearrangements between NTRK1 and TPM3 genes (TRK oncogene) were detected in 2/14 papillary carcinomas and in one lymph-node metastasis of one of these papillary thyroid carcinomas. All the radiation-associated adenomas were negative. In the 'spontaneous' tumours, only one of the 14 papillary carcinomas and one of the four in vitro culture cell lines, derived from a papillary carcinoma, presented a NTRK1 rearrangement also with the TPM3 gene. Twenty-five of this series of radiation-associated tumours were previously studied for the ras and RET/PTC oncogenes. In conclusion, our data: (a) show that the overall frequency of NTRK1 rearrangements is similar between radiation-associated (2/31: 6%) and 'spontaneous' epithelial thyroid tumours (2/32: 6%). The frequency, if we consider exclusively the papillary carcinomas, is in both cases 12%; (b) show that the TRK oncogene plays a role in the development of a minority of radiation-associated papillary thyroid carcinomas but not in adenomas; and (c) confirm that RET/PTC rearrangements are the major genetic alteration associated with ionizing radiation-induced thyroid tumorigenesis.",

Like RET, NTRK1 is often activated by rearrangements that involve one of at least five other genes in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Because of similarities in involvement of the two tyrosine kinases RET (rearranged during transfection) and NTRK1 in the pathogenesis of PTC, the obvious parallels between RET and NTRK1 and between PTC and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), NTRK1 seemed to be an excellent candidate gene to play a role in the genesis of MTC. Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis of 16 exons of NTRK1, from 31 sporadic MTC, revealed variants in five exons (exons 4 and 14-17). Sequence analysis demonstrated one sequence variant each in exons 4, 14, 16, and 17, and four different variants in exon 15. Differential restriction enzyme digestion specific for each variant confirmed the sequencing results. All variants were also present in the corresponding germline DNA. Interestingly, the sequence variants at codon 604 (c1810C>T) and codon 613 (c1838G>T) ofexon 15 always occurred together and might represent linkage disequilibrium. The frequencies of the sequence variants in germline DNA from patients with sporadic MTC did not differ significantly from those in a race-matched control group. Although we did not find any somatic mutations of NTRK1 in sporadic MTC, the single-strand conformational polymorphism conditions reported here, together with the knowledge of the frequency of various sequence variants, may help in future mutation analyses of DNA from other neural and nonneural tissues.",

NTRK1 rearrangements were rare (3.3%). In 3.3%, we observed novel types of RET rearrangements: GOLGA5/ RET (PTC5), HTIF/RET (PTC6), RFG7/RET (PTC7), and an as yet undefined RFGX/RET.RET rearrangements, preferentially ELE1/RET, are related to rapid tumor development. At longer intervals after exposure to ionizing radiation, the prevalence of RET rearrangements declines with a shift from ELE1/RET to H4/RET, most significantly in female patients. The prevalence of specific types of rearrangements is independent of age at irradiation. A significantly higher prevalence of ELE1/RET was observed in the most heavily contaminated Oblasts, Gomel and Brest, suggesting a preferential formation of this type of rearrangement after high thyroid doses. RET rearrangement is related to aggressive growth: Rearrangement-positive PTCs were in a more advanced pT category and more frequently in the pN1 category at presentation than rearrangement-negative PTCs. ELE1/RET is related to the solid variant of PTC, H4/RET more frequently to typical papillary structures.

Oncogenic potential in thyrocytes results from replacing the 5' portion by regulatory parts of other genes, leading to constitutive TK expression. In Italy, human papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) shows a frequent activation (50%) of the TK receptor genes NTRK1 and RET. Both genes undergo oncogenic rearrangements by the same mechanism. We previously reported high frequency (6/11) of rearrangement of the RET protooncogene in Chinese PTCs. Wide differences in the frequency (0-10.9%) of the NTRK1 rearrangement in PTCs have been reported in different populations. To investigate the frequency of TRK protooncogene rearrangement in Chinese thyroid tumors, we performed reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to amplify specific TRK rearrangement transcripts. We examined thyroid tumors of 40 patients, including 14 papillary carcinomas, 4 follicular carcinomas, 1 Hurthle cell carcinoma, 1 insular carcinoma, and 20 nodular goiters.

Using Western blot analysis, p-rpS6, p-4EBP1, 4EBP1, and eIF4E were detected at higher levels in aggressive PTC and MTC cells.

The other oncogenic event recently identified in PTC is the BRAF V600E mutation. Because the role of TrkA was not completely elucidated in thyroid cancer ethiopathogenesis, we decided to study the expression of active, phosphorylated TrkA and of its coreceptor p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75 NTR) in a series of 92 PTC (37 lesions of conventional PTC, 28 of follicular variant of PTC [FVPTC], and 27 of other variants of PTC) as well as in 21 samples of normal thyroid and nonneoplastic thyroid lesions used as a controls. We observed neoexpression of p75 NTR in PTC, particularly in conventional PTC and in other variants of PTC displaying a papillary growth pattern, rather than in FVPTC. No immunoexpression of p75 NTR was observed in normal thyroid nor in nonneoplastic thyroid lesions. The cellular localization of p75 NTR immunoexpression was also significantly associated with the growth pattern of PTC, being much more frequently detected in an apical localization in PTC with papillary architecture than in PTC with a follicular or solid growth pattern. This apical localization of p75 NTR was significantly associated with the presence of BRAF V600E. No significant differences were detected between normal thyroid, nonneoplastic lesions, and PTC (or any PTC variant) regarding expression/activation of TrkA, thus suggesting that by itself and in contrast to p75 NTR, TrkA is not altered during PTC development.",

The thyroid TRK oncogenes are activated by recombination with at least three different genes: the gene coding for tropomyosin and TPR, both on chromosome 1,and TFG on chromosome 3. In a previous study, we showed that two tumors carrying the TPR/NTRK1 rearrangement contained structurally different oncogenes named TRK-T1 and TRK-T2. In this paper, we report (1) the cDNA structure of TRK-T2, (2) evidence that TRK-T2 is generated by different rearrangements in two thyroid tumors, and (3) a detailed analysis of the three different TPR/NTRK1 rearrangements. With molecular studies based on Southern blot hybridization, cloning, and sequencing, we show that all the rearrangements are nearly balanced, involving deletion, insertion, or duplication of only few nucleotides.

In a papillary thyroid carcinoma, we identified a novel gene (ELKS), the 5' portion of which is fused to the RET gene by gene rearrangement due to the translocation t(10;12)(q11;p13). Subsequent cloning of the ELKS cDNA revealed that ELKS encodes a novel 948 amino acid peptide and is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues. The presence of multiple coiled-coil domains in the ELKS product suggests that the ELKS protein forms dimers.

Indeed, about 40% of PTCs harbor mutations in BRAF gene, whereas RET rearrangements (RET/PTC oncogenes) are present in about 20% of cases. Finally, RAS mutations and TRK rearrangements account for about 5% each of these malignancies. We used RNA-Sequencing to identify fusion transcripts and mutations in cancer driver genes in a cohort of 18 PTC patients. Furthermore, we used targeted DNA sequencing to validate identified mutations. We extended the screening to 50 PTC patients and 30 healthy individuals. Using this approach we identified new missense mutations in CBL, NOTCH1, PIK3R4 and SMARCA4 genes. We found somatic mutations in DICER1, MET and VHL genes, previously found mutated in other tumors, but not described in PTC. We identified a new chimeric transcript generated by the fusion of WNK1 and B4GALNT3 genes, correlated with B4GALNT3 overexpression. Our data confirmed PTC genetic heterogeneity, revealing that gene expression correlates more with the mutation pattern than with tumor staging. Overall, this study provides new data about mutational landscape of this neoplasia, suggesting potential pharmacological adjuvant therapies against Notch signaling and chromatin remodeling enzymes.

A 48-year-old man presented with cervical lymphadenopathy and was found to have metastatic MTC involving cervical and mediastinal lymph nodes. He underwent thyroidectomy and debulking of metastatic disease. The resected thyroid showed bilateral MTC and a 1-cm PTC.

Both tumors were analyzed for the BRAF (Val600Glu) mutation and the RET/PTC1 translocation. The PTC was positive for the BRAF mutation but negative for RET/PTC1. The MTC was negative for both abnormalities. We conclude that the MTC was caused by the germline RET mutation, while the PTC was caused by a somatic BRAF mutation.

Thyroid tumours comprise a broad spectrum of lesions with different phenotypes and variable biological and clinical behaviour. Molecular analysis has detected specific genetic alterations in these different tumour types. In particular, the well-differentiated carcinomas of the papillary type are characterised by the activation of the tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs) RET and NTRK1 proto-oncogenes. Cytogenetic analysis of these tumours has contributed to defining the chromosomal mechanisms leading to the TKRs' oncogenic activation. The results have shown that, in the majority of the cases, intra-chromosomal inversions of chromosome 10 and of chromosome 1 lead to the formation of RET-derived and NTRK1-derived oncogenes, respectively. Exposure to ionizing radiation is associated with papillary carcinomas, and RET activation has been suggested to be related to this event. All these findings are contributing to the definition of genetic and environmental factors relevant to the pathogenesis of thyroid tumours.

An analysis of RET, APC, and TP53 gene mutations, and of RET and NTRK1 gene rearrangements, yielded negative results. No in vitro transforming activity was detected in the tumor DNA when assayed in transfection experiments. The lack of a consistent family history also made unlikely the possibility of identifying the putative germline defect by linkage analyses. Should this unusual aggregation of tumors represent a new entity, a number of genetic alterations have now been excluded.",

        "Doc_abstract":"RET/papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), TRK-T, or activating mutations of Ras and BRaf are frequent genetic alterations in PTC, all leading to the activation of the extracellular-regulated kinase (Erk) cascade. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) in the signal transduction leading to Erk activation in PTC cells. In normal thyroid cells, CaMKII and Erk were in the inactive form in the absence of stimulation. In primary PTC cultures and in PTC cell lines harboring the oncogenes RET/PTC-1 or BRaf(V600E), CaMKII was active also in the absence of any stimulation. Inhibition of calmodulin or phospholipase C (PLC) attenuated the level of CaMKII activation. Expression of recombinant RET/PTC-3, BRaf(V600E), or Ras(V12) induced CaMKII activation. Inhibition of CaMKII attenuated Erk activation and DNA synthesis in thyroid papillary carcinoma (TPC-1), a cell line harboring RET/PTC-1, suggesting that CaMKII is a component of the Erk signal cascade in this cell line. In conclusion, PTCs contain an active PLC/Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent signal inducing constitutive activation of CaMKII. This kinase is activated by BRaf(V600E), oncogenic Ras, and by RET/PTC. CaMKII participates to the activation of the Erk pathway by oncogenic Ras and RET/PTC and contributes to their signal output, thus modulating tumor cell proliferation.",

Approximately 40 percent of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) typically have either intrachromosomal or extrachromosomal rearrangements that join the promoter and NH(2)-terminal domains of unrelated genes to the COOH-terminal fragment of RET. The RET point mutations associated with MEN2A, MEN2B, or FMTC, or the chromosomal breakpoints and translocations associated with PTC, typically activate the RET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). RET kinase inhibitors are likely to be beneficial for patients with hereditary MTC, where currently there is no effective chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Recently, the low molecular weight tyrosine kinase inhibitor ZD6474 was found to block the enzymatic activity of RET-derived oncoproteins in cultured cell lines. We have developed a Drosophila model for MEN2A and MEN2B diseases by targeting oncogenic forms of RET to the developing Drosophila eye. Here we show that, when fed orally, ZD6474 suppressed RET-mediated phenotypes within the context of this in vivo model. Importantly, ZD6474 showed high efficacy and very low toxicity. This compound failed to significantly suppress an activated form of another RTK, the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor, nor did it suppress the activity of downstream components of the RET/Ras pathway. Our results support the view that targeting chemical kinase inhibitors such as ZD6474 to tissues with oncogenic forms of RET is a useful treatment strategy for RET-dependent carcinomas.",

BRAF V600E mutation analysis was performed by mutation-specific PCR using the same cell material; a hybrid-specific RT-PCR assay was used for detection of RET/PTC1 rearrangements.

Cytology classified eight FNABs as benign, while postoperative histology demonstrated a thyroid malignancy (6 PTCs, 1 FTC, 1 metastasis). In four of these eight cases, the genetic analysis detected a BRAF V600E mutation or a RET/PTC1 rearrangement.

This study has examined the MNG1 and TCO loci to determine if they are similarly predisposing the Tas1 family to PTC. Linkage analysis using identical microsatellite markers described in the two previous studies was used to determine the significance of these loci in the Tasmanian family. The resultant LOD scores were sufficiently negative using multipoint parametric analysis to exclude these two loci from involvement in the Tasmanian family. In addition, six candidate genes, RET, TRK, MET, TSHR, APC and PTEN were also excluded as susceptibility genes in Tas1 by using microsatellites that are positioned in or in close proximity to these genes.

It has been claimed that RAS, p53 or GSP mutations and RET or TRK rearrangements might play a role in adult thyroid tumors. In childhood, the thyroid gland is particularly sensitive to ionizing radiation. The reactor accident in Chernobyl provided a unique chance to study molecular genetic aberrations in a cohort of children who developed papillary thyroid carcinomas after a short latency time after exposure to high doses of radioactive iodine isotopes. According to the concepts of molecular genetic epidemiology, exposure to a specific type of irradiation might result in a typical molecular lesion. Childhood papillary thyroid tumors after Chernobyl exhibit a high prevalence of RET rearrangement as almost the only molecular alteration. The majority showed RET/PTC3 (i.e., ELE/RET rearrangements), including several subtypes. Less frequently, RET/PTC1 (i.e., H4/RET rearrangements), and a novel type (RET/PTC5, i.e., RFG5/RET) were observed. Proof of reciprocal transcripts suggests that a balanced intrachromosomal inversion leads to this rearrangement. Breakpoint analyses revealed short homologous nucleotide stretches at the fusion points. In all types of rearrangement, the RET tyrosine kinase domain becomes controlled by 5' fused regulatory sequences of ubiquitously expressed genes that display coiled-coil regions with dimerization potential. Oncogenic activation of RET is apparently due to ligand-independent constitutive ectopic RET tyrosine kinase activity. The analysis of this cohort of children with radiation-induced thyroid tumors after Chernobyl provides insights into typical molecular aberrations in relation to a specific mode of environmental exposure and may serve as a paradigm for molecular genetic epidemiology.",

Despite their origin from the same type of cells, the two neoplasias show different biological behavior and a different set of genetic features, including specific cytogenetic patterns. Thyroid adenoma is the benign counterpart of follicular carcinoma. No benign counterpart of papillary carcinoma has yet been identified. The chromosomes of thyroid nodules have been investigated since 1965, and different cytogenetic subgroups have been recognized, some of which show structural chromosomal rearrangements. These structural changes lead to the formation of fusion genes RET-PTC, TRK(-T), and BRAF-AKAP9, which originate as a result of intrachromosomal or interchromosomal rearrangements and are found in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Fusion genes involving PPARγ are caused mainly by translocations and are characteristic of follicular neoplastic tissue.

Because of its unprecedented scale and its emotional implications, this finding has raised concern and called the attention of the scientific community to this major health problem. Although epidemiologically documented, a direct correlation between thyroid cancer and radiation exposure has not been definitely proven at the molecular level. On the assumption that ionizing radiation could cause specific and common cancer-associated genetic lesions, an analysis of oncogene activation and/or tumor suppressor gene inactivation would help to define radiation-induced thyroid carcinomas. Therefore, we have analyzed by different molecular approaches, including Southern blotting, DNA transfection assay on NIH-3T3 cells, and reverse transcription-PCR analysis, six papillary carcinomas from children living in the region of Belarus at the time of the Chernobyl nuclear accident to identify tumor-specific gene rearrangements of the proto-oncogenes RET and TRK, previously found activated in a tumor type-specific manner in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Using Southern blot analysis in four cases, we could detect specific rearranged bands indicating an oncogenic activation of RET that in three cases resulted in rearranged sequences provided by the same activating gene. Moreover, the DNA of the last three cases showed a biological activity in transforming NIH-3T3 cells after the DNA-mediated transfection assay, and the respective NIH-3T3 transfectants were found to express the oncogenic fusion transcripts.

To clarify which gene alteration, chromosome aberration, or point mutation preferentially occurs in radiation-associated adult-onset papillary thyroid cancer, we have performed molecular analyses on RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF(V600E) mutation in 71 papillary thyroid cancer cases among atomic bomb survivors (including 21 cases not exposed to atomic bomb radiation), in relation to radiation dose as well as time elapsed since atomic bomb radiation exposure. RET/PTC rearrangements showed significantly increased frequency with increased radiation dose (P(trend) = 0.002). In contrast, BRAF(V600E) mutation was less frequent in cases exposed to higher radiation dose (P(trend) < 0.001). Papillary thyroid cancer subjects harboring RET/PTC rearrangements developed this cancer earlier than did cases with BRAF(V600E) mutation (P = 0.03). These findings were confirmed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. These results suggest that RET/PTC rearrangements play an important role in radiation-associated thyroid carcinogenesis.",

These genetic alterations, which rarely overlap in the same tumor, result in signaling abnormalities in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In contrast, genetic alterations in follicular carcinomas include PAX8-PPARgamma translocations and RAS mutations while mutations of CTNNB1 and p53 have been implicated in the development and progression of poorly differentiated and undifferentiated (anaplastic) thyroid carcinomas. Germline mutations of RET are responsible for the development of heritable forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) while somatic mutations of this oncogene are found in a significant proportion of sporadic MTCs.

Twenty-seven of 196 (13.8%) MTC cases showed an association with PTC and in particular 21 of 190 (11.05%) with an incidental mPTC. This percentage is higher than that reported in the literature on the association of mPTC with GD (2.8%-4.5%) and MNG (3%).

We also analyzed the epidemiologic, clinical, and pathologic features of MTC associated and not associated with PTC without finding any difference. In particular the outcome of the MTC did not appear to be influenced by the presence of the PTC and the specific radioiodine treatments.

Constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is a major event in the carcinogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), the most prevalent endocrine malignancy. Affected elements include RET/PTC rearrangements and point mutations of the Ras and BRAF genes. Mutations in these genes are found in over 70% of PTC. Chromosomal RET rearrangements, called RET/PTC, result in constitutive ligand-independent activation of RET kinase, which was the first genetic anomaly detected in PTC and is found in 5-70% of tumoral samples. Although less frequent, the activation of other tyrosine kinase receptors, such as NTRK1, c-Met or EGFR, has also been reported in PTC. The BRAF mutation represents the most common genetic alteration found in PTC. More than 90% of BRAF mutations lead to a change of a valine to a glutamic acid at position 600 (V600E). Finally, Ras is the least affected molecule in the pathway. A relationship between clinical behavior and these genetic alterations has been proposed. Thus, the BRAF mutation is associated with a more aggressive PTC phenotype and is correlated with poorer outcomes. However, no clear association has been found between RET/PTC and clinical features. The discovery of these alterations opens the way to new therapeutic strategies, especially to treat those patients in whom conventional therapy is not effective. Several new drugs are being tested, such as small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Some of these recently developed agents have begun to be used with promising results.",

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) may have a very benign course while undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UTC) belongs to the most aggressive human malignancies. A variety of genes have been identified to be involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid carcinoma. Somatic Ras mutations seem to be an early event and are frequently found in follicular thyroid carcinomas. Somatic rearrangements of RET and TRK are almost exclusively found in PTC and may be found in early stages. Germline RET missense mutations lead to hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). In contrast, the significance of somatic RET mutations in sporadic MTC is unknown. p53 seems to play a crucial role in the dedifferentiation process of thyroid carcinoma. The precise role of PTEN remains to be elucidated. The only clearly identified exogenous factor that may lead to thyroid carcinoma (mainly PTC) is radiation. Of interest, radiation is capable to induce RET rearrangements. In general, early diagnosis is mandatory to enable the chance of cure. Surgery is the treatment of choice. Depending on the tumour type, surgery in combination with either radioiodine, external radiation or chemotherapy often enables the control of local tumour burden. In MTC and UTC, once thyroid cancer is spread to distant organs, efficacious therapeutic agents are almost non-existing. However, our growing knowledge of genes involved in thyroidal oncogenesis may contribute to the development of more effective treatment modalities.

In this study, we demonstrate that the BRAF-V600E, RET/PTC, and TRK oncogenes upregulate the ERK1/2 pathway's attenuator cytoplasmic dual-phase phosphatase DUSP6/MKP3 in thyroid cells. We also show DUSP6 overexpression at the mRNA and protein levels in all the analysed PTC cell lines. Furthermore, DUSP6 mRNA was significantly higher in PTC and PDTC in comparison with normal thyroid tissues both in expression profile datasets and in patients' surgical samples analysed by real-time RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical and western blot analyses showed that DUSP6 was also overexpressed at the protein level in most PTC and PDTC surgical samples tested, but not in ATC, and revealed a positive correlation trend with ERK1/2 pathway activation. Finally, DUSP6 silencing reduced the neoplastic properties of four PTC cell lines, thus suggesting that DUSP6 may have a pro-tumorigenic role in thyroid carcinogenesis.",

However, in ABS with PTC, the relationship between the presence of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene fused with other gene partners and radiation exposure has received little study.

In addition, solid/trabecular-like architecture in PTC was closely associated with ALK rearrangements, being observed in 6 of 10 PTC cases with ALK rearrangements versus 2 of 15 cases with no ALK rearrangements. The six radiation-exposed cases of PTC harboring both ALK rearrangements and solid/trabecular-like architecture were associated with higher radiation doses and younger ages at the time of the A-bombing and at diagnosis compared to the other 19 PTC with no detectable gene alterations.;Our findings suggest that ALK rearrangements are involved in the development of radiation-induced adult-onset PTC.",

Such features suggest the possibility of using specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors to block the Ret oncoproteins signaling. The present report summarizes the cellular effects of the arylidene 2-indolinone Ret inhibitor RPI-1 (formerly Cpd1) on the human PTC cell line TPC-1 which spontaneously harbors the RET/PTC1 oncogene. The results provide evidence that RPI-1 is able to inhibit cell growth and to interfere with Ret/ptc1-driven signaling.

A completion left ALN dissection and supraclavicular LN excision was performed and the patient is currently with stable disease.;Sixteen reports of ALN metastases from thyroid cancer exist in the literature: 11 PTC, 2 mucoepidermoid carcinoma variants, and 1 each of follicular thyroid carcinoma, MTC, and poorly differentiated mucin-producing adenocarcinoma. This study reports the second case of MTC metastatic to ALNs.;Thyroid cancer ALN metastases are rare representations of distant metastatic disease. Complete surgical resection remains the standard of care for all MTC metastases and for DTC patients with local symptoms or otherwise stable disease that can tolerate the operation.",

Several TK inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials, but it is unknown which inhibitor is most effective and whether there is any specificity for particular RET mutations.;We aimed to compare the effect of four TK inhibitors (axitinib, sunitinib, vandetanib, and XL184) on cell proliferation, RET expression and autophosphorylation, and ERK activation in cell lines expressing a MEN2A (MTC-TT), a MEN2B (MZ-CRC-1) mutation, and a RET/PTC (TPC-1) rearrangement.;The three cell lines were cultured and treated with the four TK inhibitors. Effects on cell proliferation and RET and ERK expression and activation were determined.;XL184 and vandetanib most effectively inhibited cell proliferation, RET autophosphorylation in combination with a reduction of RET expression, and ERK phosphorylation in MTC-TT and MZ-CRC-1, respectively. TPC-1 cells showed a decrease in RET autophosphorylation after treatment with XL184, but no effect was observed on ERK activation.;There is indeed specificity for different RET mutations, with XL184 being the most potent inhibitor in MEN2A and PTC and vandetanib the most effective in MEN2B in vitro. No TK inhibitor was superior for all the cell lines tested, indicating that mutation-specific therapies could be beneficial in treating MTC and PTC.",

The aim of this retrospective study was to describe clinical, pathologic characteristics and the prevalence of diagnosing such patients in our clinic. Between October 2003 and December 2013, 1.420 consecutive patients diagnosed by histology as having differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) and treated with radioactive iodide (RAI) were retrospectively investigated. Of these, 4 patients were diagnosed by histology as having simultaneous MTC and PTC. The clinical and pathology characteristics of these patients are described. The prevalence of simultaneous MTC and PTC of these 4 patients in our clinic was 0.28% of all patients with DTC. The age of the 4 patients ranged from 44 to 63 years and were three females and one male. These patients are currently alive without disease from either of the two types of cancer. In two of these patients, MTC was located in the left and PTC in the right thyroid lobe. One patient had MTC in the right lobe and PTC in both lobes. The remaining patient had both cancers in the left lobe as a mixed tumor. We are able to present the pathology of only 2 of these 4 patients. In these 2 patients MTC was located in the left and PTC in the right thyroid lobe, one of them was female and the other was male, aged 44 and 49, respectively. In conclusion, our results suggested that simultaneous occurrence of MTC and PTC had a prevalence in our clinic of 0.28% among 1420 consecutive patients with DTC or 0.14%, if only the 2 patients in whom we are able to present their pathology slides are considered.

Immunohistochemistry for PAX8, TTF-1, thyroglobulin, mammaglobin, GCDFP-15, S-100 protein, and p63 was used to define the tumor immunophenotype. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for ETV6 rearrangement was performed in three, and the next-generation sequencing assay MSK-IMPACT™ (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets) was performed in two cases. Primary MASC of the thyroid occurred in two women and one man, age 47-72 years. All patients presented with high T stage, infiltrative, locally aggressive tumors with extrathyroidal extension. Two cases were associated with well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma. Histologically, they appeared as low-grade tumors, resembling MASC of the salivary glands and labeled positive for mammaglobin, GCDFP-15, S-100 protein, p63, weakly positive for PAX8, and negative for TTF-1 and thyroglobulin. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed ETV6 rearrangement in all cases. In two tested cases MSK-IMPACT™ confirmed the presence of ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion. Two patients had at least two local recurrences, one was alive with disease, and one was alive and free of disease after 14 and 17 years, respectively. The third patient was alive and free of disease after 2 years. MASC of the thyroid is histologically, immunophenotypically, and genetically similar to its salivary gland counterpart. Thyroid MASC can be associated with a well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma component, supporting follicular cell origin. Clinically, these carcinomas may show frequent recurrences but are associated with long-term survival. Patients with MASC of the thyroid may potentially benefit from Trk molecular-targeted therapy.

TERT promoter mutations namely C228T and C250T that stimulate TERT transcription and telomerase activation have recently been identified in many human malignancies. We thus determined these mutations and their biological and clinical implications in thyroid carcinomas in the present study. The TERT promoter was sequenced in 10 thyroid cancer cell lines and 144 tumors from 20 patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), 51 with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 36 with follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), and 37 with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). We identified C228T or C250T mutation in 6/8 of ATC cell lines, as well as in tumor tissue from 10/20, 13/51, 8/36 and 0/37 patients with ATC, PTC, FTC and MTC, respectively. In PTC patients, these mutations were exclusively present in the group with age >45 years (P<0.0001), and highly correlated shorter telomeres (P<0.0001) and distant metastasis (P=0.028). The previous radioactivity exposure did not induce the mutation. The presence of C228T or C250T was an independent predictor associated with shorter disease-related survival (DRS) in the entire cohort (P<0.0001), as well as among patients >45 years (P=0.021). ATC patients carrying the mutation survived shorter than those without mutations, although not statistically significant (P=0.129). The TERT promoter mutation was associated with overall survival (P=0.038) and DRS (P=0.058) of FTC patients. Taken together, age- and shorter telomere-dependent TERT promoter mutations occur frequently in follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinoma (ATC, PTC and FTC) but not in parafollicular cell-originated MTC, and may serve as a marker for aggressive disease and poor outcome.

Ligand-induced activation induces dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation of the RET receptor with downstream activation of several signal transduction pathways. Activating germline RET mutations play a central role in the development of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and also in the development of the congenital abnormality Hirschsprung's disease. Approximately 50% of patients with sporadic MTC have somatic RET mutations, and a significant portion of papillary thyroid carcinomas result from chromosomal inversions or translocations, which activate RET (RET/PTC oncogenes). The RET protooncogene has a significant place in cancer prevention and treatment. Timely thyroidectomy in kindred members who have inherited a mutated RET allele, characteristic of MEN2A, MEN2B, or FMTC, can prevent MTC, the most common cause of death in these syndromes.

        "Doc_abstract":"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) arises from the thyroid follicular epithelium and represents the most frequent thyroid malignancy. PTC is associated with gene rearrangements generating RET/PTC and TRK oncogenes, and to the BRAFV600E activating point mutation. A role of tumor-suppressor genes in the pathogenesis of PTC has not been assessed yet. The tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP3) gene, encoding a metalloproteinases inhibitor and capable of inhibiting growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis of several cancers, was found to be silenced by promoter methylation in a consistent fraction of PTCs, in association with tumor aggressiveness and BRAFV600E mutation, thus suggesting an oncosuppressor role. To explore this possibility, in this study we performed gene expression and functional studies. Analysis of gene expression data produced in our laboratory as well as meta-analysis of publicly available data sets confirmed the downregulation of TIMP3 gene expression in PTC with respect to normal thyroid. The functional consequences of TIMP3 downregulation were investigated in the PTC-derived NIM1 cell line, in which the expression of TIMP3 is silenced. Restoration of TIMP3 expression by exposure to soluble TIMP3 protein or by complementary DNA transfection had no effect on the growth rate of NIM1 cells. Instead, it affected the adhesive, migratory and invasive capabilities of NIM1 cells by modulating several proteins involved in these processes. A striking effect was observed in vivo, as TIMP3 reduced the tumorigenicity of NIM1 cells by repressing angiogenesis and macrophage infiltration. Our data indicate that the loss of TIMP3 expression exerts a functional role in the pathogenesis of PTC.",

Upon the onset of puberty, the incidence of thyroid cancer increases in females only and declines again after menopause. Estrogen is a potent growth factor both for benign and malignant thyroid cells that may explain the sex difference in the prevalence of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. It exerts its growth-promoting effect through a classical genomic and a non-genomic pathway, mediated via a membrane-bound estrogen receptor. This receptor is linked to the tyrosine kinase signaling pathways MAPK and PI3K. In papillary thyroid carcinomas, these pathways may be activated either by a chromosomal rearrangement of the tyrosine receptor kinase TRKA, by RET/PTC genes, or by a BRAF mutation and, in addition, in females they may be stimulated by high levels of estrogen. Furthermore, estrogen is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and metastasis that are critical for the outcome of thyroid cancer. In contrast to other carcinomas, however, detailed knowledge on this regulation is still missing for thyroid cancer.",

Recently, we have characterized the novel tumor suppressor gene RASSF1 located in this locus. The RASSF1A isoform is epigenetically inactivated in a variety of human primary tumors. In this study, we investigated the expression and methylation status of the RASSF1 gene in thyroid carcinoma. In nine thyroid cancer cell lines, the RASSF1A promoter CpG island was methylated completely, and expression was absent. Treatment of these cell lines with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine reactivated the transcription of RASSF1A. The methylation status of the RASSF1A promoter was analyzed in 38 primary thyroid tumors, including 1 poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma, 5 medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 10 follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), 9 undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (UTC), and 13 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). In 71% of thyroid carcinomas, the RASSF1A CpG island was hypermethylated. Methylation frequency was higher in the aggressive forms of thyroid carcinoma and was found in 80% of MTC, in 78% of UTC, and in 70% of FTC, compared with 62% in the more benign PTC. RASSF1A inactivation was detected in all stages of thyroid carcinoma scored by Tumor-Node-Metastasis classification. Additionally, we analyzed the methylation frequency of the CpG island of cell cycle inhibitor p16(INK4a) in the same thyroid tumors. The p16 gene was inactivated in 56 and 25% of cell lines and primary tumors, respectively. p16 methylation was detected in 56% of UTC, 10% of FTC, and 25% of PTC but not in MTC. In UTC, which belongs to the most aggressive carcinomas in humans, the most common combined inactivation of RASSF1A and p16 was detected. In general, 90% of tumors with p16 inactivation were also silenced for RASSF1A expression. However, RASSF1A hypermethylation was detected three times more frequently in thyroid cancers. Thus, RASSF1A inactivation may play a crucial role in the malignancy of thyroid carcinoma.",

RET gene rearrangements, which lead to the generation of chimeric RET/papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) oncogenes, occur in PTC, whereas RET point mutations occur in familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) and sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC). We showed previously that the expression of the receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase J (PTPRJ) is suppressed in neoplastically transformed follicular thyroid cells. We now report that PTPRJ coimmunoprecipitates with wild-type RET and with the MEN2A-associated RET(C634R) oncoprotein but not with the RET/PTC1 and RET-MEN2B isoforms. Using mutated forms of PTPRJ and RET-MEN2A, we show that the integrity of the respective catalytic domains is required for the PTPRJ/RET-MEN2A interaction. PTPRJ expression induces dephosphorylation of the RET(C634R) and, probably via an indirect mechanism, RET/PTC1 oncoproteins on two key RET autophosphorylation sites (Tyr1062 and Tyr905). This results in a significant decrease of RET-induced Shc and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation levels. In line with this finding, adoptive PTPRJ expression reduced the oncogenic activity of RET(C634R) in an in vitro focus formation assay of NIH3T3 cells. As expected from the coimmunoprecipitation results, the RET(M918T) oncoprotein, which is associated to MEN2B and sporadic MTC, was resistant to the dephosphorylating activity of PTPRJ. Taken together, these findings identify RET as a novel substrate of PTPRJ and suggest that PTPRJ expression levels may affect tumor phenotype associated with RET/PTC1 and RET(C634R) mutants. On the other hand, resistance to PTPRJ may be part of the mechanism of RET oncogenic conversion secondary to the M918T mutation.",

The demonstration of a positive association between BSP expression in primary breast tumors and the development of bone metastases suggests that this glycoprotein could play a role in the selective implantation of breast cancer cells in bone. BSP is also expressed in most lung and prostate cancers as well as in multiple myeloma, three other osteotropic malignancies.

In the papillary form of thyroid cancer (PTC), for example, activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) genes, ret or the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type I (NTRK1) by intra- or interchromosomal rearrangements have been suggested as a cause of the disease. The 1986 accident at the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, Ukraine, led to the uncontrolled release of high levels of radioisotopes. Ten years later, the incidence of childhood papillary thyroid cancer (chPTC) near Chernobyl had risen by two orders of magnitude. Tumors removed from some of these patients showed aberrant expression of the ret RTK gene due to a ret/PTC1 or ret/PTC3 rearrangement involving chromosome 10. However, many cultured chPTC cells show a normal G-banded karyotype and no ret rearrangement.

Tumor size and LN involvement have been shown to affect stage of disease; however, to our knowledge, ours is the first study that attempts to correlate anterior neck pain on presentation with the extent of disease.;We performed a retrospective review of patients with MTC who underwent an operation from February 1998 through December 2008. We compared the symptom of anterior neck pain with the pathologic extent of disease. Our control group comprised patients who underwent an operation for PTC. Analysis was performed using the Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney test.;Of the 109 patients with MTC, 50 (46%) met our inclusion criteria. Of the 50 patients with MTC, 11 presented with neck pain, compared to 3 of the 50 patients with PTC (p = 0.041). Of those 11 patients, 9 (82%) had LN involvement on final pathology, as compared with 14 (36%) of the 39 without neck pain (p = 0.014). Of patients with neck pain, 18% were diagnosed at stage I to II and 82% at stage III to IV, compared to 64% at stage I to II and 36% at stage III to IV (p = 0.014).;Our study demonstrates that more patients with MTC present with anterior neck pain than do patients with PTC and that patients with MTC and neck pain have an increased risk of LN metastases. The results of this study suggest that MTC patients, who present with concomitant neck pain, should undergo a total thyroidectomy, prophylactic bilateral central neck dissection, and ipsilateral lateral neck dissection.",

The former group did not differ from the wild-type group in terms of MTC size, prevalence of C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) or papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). However, the prevalence of an increased preoperative basal calcitonin (bCT) level (> 1000 pg/ml) was 2.75-fold higher in the patients with the GS or SS variant than in those with the wild-type variant (P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with lymph node metastases was also higher in the former group (P < 0.05).

In this study we have demonstrated a therapeutic strategy for MTC by suppressing the transcription of RET proto-oncogene though the stabilization of G-quadruplex structure formed on the promoter region of this gene using a natural product berberine.;Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) TT cell line has been used to evaluate the effects of berberine on RET expression and its downstream signaling pathways. The specificity of berberine was demonstrated by using the papillary thyroid carcinoma TPC1 cell line, which lacks the G-quadruplex forming sequence on the RET promoter region due to chromosomal rearrangement.;Berberine suppressed the RET expression by more than 90 % in MTC TT cells at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml with minimal effect on the TPC1 cells. Canadine, which is a structural analogue of berberine, showed little interaction with RET G-quadruplex and also had no effect on RET expression in MTC TT cells. The down-regulation of RET with berberine further inhibited the cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest and activation of apoptosis in TT cells, which was confirmed by a 2-fold increase in the caspase-3 activity and the down-regulation of cell-cycle regulatory proteins.;Our data strongly suggest that the G-quadruplex forming region and the stabilization of this structure play a critical role in mediating the repressive effect of berberine on RET transcription.",

Nevertheless, in some cases the interpretation of FNAC results may be problematic due to limitations of the method. The expression level of some microRNAs changes with the development of thyroid tumors, and its quantitation can be used to refine the FNAC results. For this quantitation to be reliable, the obtained data must be adequately normalized. Currently, no reference genes are universally recognized for quantitative assessments of microRNAs in thyroid nodules. The aim of the present study was the selection and validation of such reference genes. Expression of 800 microRNAs in 5 paired samples of thyroid surgical material corresponding to different histotypes of tumors was analyzed using Nanostring technology and four of these (hsa-miR-151a-3p, -197-3p, -99a-5p and -214-3p) with the relatively low variation coefficient were selected. The possibility of use of the selected microRNAs and their combination as references was estimated by RT-qPCR on a sampling of cytological smears: benign (n=226), atypia of undetermined significance (n=9), suspicious for follicular neoplasm (n=61), suspicious for malignancy (n=19), medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) (n=32), papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) (n=54) and non-diagnostic material (ND) (n=34). In order to assess the expression stability of the references, geNorm algorithm was used. The maximum stability was observed for the normalization factor obtained by the combination of all 4 microRNAs. Further validation of the complex normalizer and individual selected microRNAs was performed using 5 different classification methods on 3 groups of FNAC smears from the analyzed batch: benign neoplasms, MTC and PTC. In all cases, the use of the complex classifier resulted in the reduced number of errors. On using the complex microRNA normalizer, the decision-tree method C4.5 makes it possible to distinguish between malignant and benign thyroid neoplasms in cytological smears with high overall accuracy (>91%).",

Clinical biological characteristic of the histological variants was investigated. Sixty cases of PTC were selected. As the important parts of micro ecosystems, ECM, MMPs, CAMs and cytokine were investigated in use of tissue chip and method of immunohistochemistry. In addition, a group of cases of thyroid carcinoma including PTC was analyzed, follicular thyroid carcinoma and medulla thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and their reports of PET-CT as the initiation.;The variants could be divided into three groups in terms of the rate of cervical lymph node metastasis. The high-metastases group included diffuse sclerosing variant, tall cell variant, column cell variant and diffuse follicular variant. The low-metastases group included macrofollicular variant and papillary microcarcinomas. Others are included in the moderate-metastases group. The rate of cervical lymph node metastasis of each group were 83.0% , 55.5% and 34.1% (P < 0. 05), respectively. The 10-year-survival were 75.3% , 95.8% and 100.0% , respectively.

We have illustrated two cases where serum calcitonin was used in the evaluation of thyroid nodule and rates proved to be high. A stimulation test was performed, using calcium as secretagogue, and calcitonin hyper-stimulation was confirmed, but anatomopathologic examination did not evidence medullar neoplasia. Anatomopathologic diagnosis detected Hashimoto thyroiditis in one case and adenomatous goiter plus an occult papillary thyroid carcinoma in the other one. Recommendation for routine use of serum calcitonin in the initial diagnostic evaluation of a thyroid nodule, followed by a confirming stimulation test if basal serum calcitonin is showed to be high, is the most currently recommended approach, but questions concerning cost-benefit and possibility of diagnosis error make the validity of this recommendation discussible.

In these cancers, RET activates the ERK/MAPK, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the JAK/STAT3 pathways. Here, we tested the efficacy of a JAK1/2- inhibitor, AZD1480, in the in vitro and in vivo growth of thyroid cancer cell lines expressing oncogenic RET. Thyroid cancer cell lines harboring RET/PTC1 (TPC-1), RET M918T (MZ-CRC1) and RET C634W (TT) alterations, as well as TPC-1 xenografts, were treated with JAK inhibitor, AZD1480. This inhibitor led to growth inhibition and/or apoptosis of the thyroid cancer cell lines in vitro, as well as to tumor regression of TPC-1 xenografts, where it efficiently blocked STAT3 activation in tumor and stromal cells. This inhibition was associated with decreased proliferation, decreased blood vessel density, coupled with increased necrosis. However, AZD1480 repressed the growth of STAT3- deficient TPC-1 cells in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that its effects in this cell line were independent of STAT3 in the tumor cells. In all cell lines, the JAK inhibitor reduced phospho-Y1062 RET levels, and mTOR effector phospho-S6, while JAK1/2 downregulation by siRNA did not affect cell growth nor RET and S6 activation. In conclusion, AZD1480 effectively blocks proliferation and tumor growth of activated RET- thyroid cancer cell lines, likely through direct RET inhibition in cancer cells as well as by modulation of the microenvironment (e.g. via JAK/phospho-STAT3 inhibition in endothelial cells). Thus, AZD1480 should be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of RET- activated thyroid cancers.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid cancers are largely divided into medullary (MTC) and non-medullary (NMTC) cancers , depending on the cell type of origin. Familial non-medullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) comprises about 5-15% of NMTC and is a heterogeneous group of diseases, including both non-syndromic and syndromic forms. Non-syndromic FNMTC tends to manifest papillary thyroid carcinoma , usually multifocal and bilateral . Several high-penetrance genes for FNMTC have been identified, but they are often confined to a few or single families, and other susceptibility loci appear to play a small part, conferring only small increments in risk. Familial susceptibility is likely to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental influences. The current focus of research in FNMTC is to characterise the susceptibility genes and their role in carcinogenesis. FNMTC can also occur as a part of multitumour genetic syndromes such as familial adenomatous polyposis , Cowden's disease , Werner's syndrome and Carney complex . These tend to present at an early age and are multicentric and bilateral with distinct pathology. The clinical evaluation of these patients is similar to that for most patients with a thyroid nodule. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) arises from the parafollicular cells of the thyroid which release calcitonin. The familial form of MTC accounts for 20-25% of cases and presents as a part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndromes or as a pure familial MTC (FMTC). They are caused by germline point mutations in the RET oncogene on chromosome 10q11.2. There is a clear genotype-phenotype correlation, and the aggressiveness of FMTC depends on the specific genetic mutation, which should determine the timing of surgery.",

Complete total thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for PTC, FTC, and MTC. Radioiodine is routinely recommended in high-risk patients and considered in intermediate risk DTC patients. DTC cancer cells, during tumor progression, may lose the iodide uptake ability, becoming resistant to radioiodine, with a significant worsening of the prognosis. The lack of specific and effective drugs for aggressive and metastatic DTC and MTC leads to additional efforts toward the development of new drugs. Several genetic alterations in different molecular pathways in TC have been shown in the past few decades, associated with TC development and progression. Rearranged during transfection (RET)/PTC gene rearrangements, RET mutations, BRAF mutations, RAS mutations, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 angiogenesis pathways are some of the known pathways determinant in the development of TC. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are small organic compounds inhibiting tyrosine kinases auto-phosphorylation and activation, most of them are multikinase inhibitors. TKIs act on the aforementioned molecular pathways involved in growth, angiogenesis, local, and distant spread of TC. TKIs are emerging as new therapies of aggressive TC, including DTC, MTC, and anaplastic thyroid cancer, being capable of inducing clinical responses and stabilization of disease. Vandetanib and cabozantinib have been approved for the treatment of MTC, while sorafenib and lenvatinib for DTC refractory to radioiodine. These drugs prolong median progression-free survival, but until now no significant increase has been observed on overall survival; side effects are common.

Although most are indolent tumors with a very favorable outcome with the current standard of care therapy, a small subset of tumors may be among the most lethal malignancies known to man. While surgery and radioactive iodine are the standard of care for differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC) and are effective in curing a majority of such patients, those with iodine-resistant cancers pose a great challenge for clinicians, as these patients have limited treatment options and poor prognoses. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) has no effective systemic therapy despite the genetic and signaling defects that have been well characterized for the last two decades. Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most aggressive solid tumors that remains fatal despite conventional multimodality therapy. Increased understanding of the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma, the most common type of DTC, as well as ATC, has led to the development of targeted therapies aimed at signaling pathways and angiogenesis that are critical to the development and/or progression of such tumors. Development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting known pathogenetic defects in MTC has led to testing of such agents in the clinic. Numerous clinical trials have been conducted over the last 5 years to examine the effects of these targeted molecular therapies on the outcomes of patients with iodine-refractory DTC, MTC and ATC. Conduction of such trials in the last few years represents a major breakthrough in the field of thyroid cancer. Several trials testing targeted therapies offer promise for setting new standards for the future of patients with progressive thyroid cancer.

Based on our recent data of CD30 ligand (CD30L)/CD30 receptor (CD30) in these nodules and on the knowledge that this signal stimulates IL-6 production in non-thyroid neoplasms, we wanted to evaluate the immunocytochemical expression of these 2 ligand/receptor systems in a large archival series of paraffin-embedded specimens. These specimens included 6 normal thyroids and 130 thyroid nodules. Co-expression of IL-6 and IL-6R in the epithelial (follicular) cells was observed solely in CD30L/CD30 positive nodules: 5/15 (33%) oncocytic adenomas; 6/30 (20%) follicular adenomas which belonged to 2 variants (4/4 microfollicular toxic and 2/2 hyalinizing trabecular); 9/30 (30%) papillary thyroid cancers (PTC), all belonging to the conventional variant. In PTC the proportion of tumor epithelial cells that were IL6 positive was inversely correlated with the pTNM staging (r=-0.549, p=0.01). All 15 follicular cancers (FTC), all 6 anaplastic cancers (ATC) were IL-6/lL-6R negative; 14/15 FTC and 5/6 ATC were CD30L/CD30 negative. In another oncocytic adenoma, another 4 conventional PTC and another 7 non-conventional PTC CD30L/CD30 expression was associated to expression of IL-6 only. IL-6 staining associated to absent expression of CD30L and CD30 was observed in 7 follicular adenomas (all belonging to variants different from toxic and hyalinizing trabecular), 2 oncocytic adenomas, 5 of the 30 colloid nodules and 2 normal thyroids. Of the 6 tumors arising from the parafollicular C cells (medullary thyroid cancer, MTC), all 3 that had metastasized were CD30L/CD30/IL-6 positive and IL-6R negative; only IL-6 expression was lost in both the local and distant metastases. This finding matched the loss of IL-6 expression in one PTC metastasis. All 3 non-metastasized MTC were IL-6/IL-6R negative, and 1/3 was CD30L positive/CD30 negative. We conclude that only in a subset of both benign and malignant thyroid nodules the IL-6/IL-6R signal could be induced by the CD30L/CD30. IL-6 expression is related with aggressiveness in both PTC and MTC. In the normal thyroid tissue, colloid nodules, and another subset of benign and malignant thyroid nodules, IL-6 expression is under control of signals other than CD30L/CD30.",

Although nonmedullary thyroid cancer (NMTC) is mostly sporadic, evidence for a familial form, which is not associated with other Mendelian cancer syndromes (e.g., familial adenomatous polyposis and Cowden's syndrome), is well documented and thought to cause more aggressive disease. Just over a decade ago, the search for a genetic susceptibility locus for familial NMTC (FNMTC) began. This review details the genetic studies conducted thus far in the search for potential genes for FNMTC.;An electronic PubMed search was performed from the English literature for genetics of FNMTC and genetics of familial papillary thyroid carcinoma (subdivision of FNMTC). The references from the selected papers were reviewed to identify further studies not found in the original search criteria.;Six potential regions for harboring an FNMTC gene have been identified: MNG1 (14q32), TCO (19p13.2), fPTC/PRN (1q21), NMTC1 (2q21), FTEN (8p23.1-p22), and the telomere-telomerase complex. Important genes reported to have been excluded are RET, TRK, MET, APC, PTEN, and TSHR.;The genetics of FNMTC is an exciting field in medical research that has the potential to permit individualized management of thyroid cancer. Studies thus far have been on small family groups using varying criteria for the diagnosis of FNMTC. Results have been contradictory and further large-scale genetic studies utilizing emerging molecular screening tests are warranted to elucidate the underlying genetic basis of FNMTC.",

The Trk signals spatiotemporally regulate neural development and maintenance of neural network. However, Trk was originally cloned as an oncogene fused with the tropomyosin gene in the extracellular domain. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the rearranged Trk oncogene is often observed in non-neuronal neoplasms such as colon and papillary thyroid cancers, while the signals through the receptors encoded by the proto-oncogene Trks regulate growth, differentiation and apoptosis of the tumors with neuronal origin such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. The intracellular Trk signaling pathway is also different depending on the Trk family receptors, cell types and the grade of transformation. Furthermore, developmentally programmed cell death of neuron, which is largely regulated by neurotrophin signaling, is at least in part controlled by tumor suppressors p53 and p73 as well as their antagonist DeltaNp73. Thus, the Trks and their downstream signaling function in both ontogenesis and oncogenesis.

The role of ghrelin and obestatin in the thyroid gland appears very interesting due to their probable involvement in cell proliferation. Furthermore, since the thyroid gland is associated with the maintenance of energy balance, the relationship between ghrelin, obestatin and thyroid function is worthy of consideration. The aim of the study was to assess ghrelin and obestatin immunocytochemical expression in nodular goiter (NG), papillary cancer (PTC) and medullary cancer (MTC).;Analyzed samples included 9 cases of NG, 8 cases of PTC and 11 cases of MTC. The analysis of ghrelin and obestatin expression was performed by use of the immunohistochemical (IHC) EnVision system and evaluated with filter HSV software (quantitative morphometric analysis).;Quantitative ghrelin expression in MTC cells was higher than in NG (p = 0.013) and correlated negatively with the size of the tumor (r= -0.829, p < 0.05). We did not observe any differences in ghrelin expression neither between MTC and PTC nor between NG and PTC. Obestatin immunoexpression pattern in all analyzed specimens was irregular and poorly accented. The strongest immunoreactivity for obestatin was demonstrated in NG. In MTC obestatin expression was significantly weaker than in NG and PTC (p < 0.05 in both cases). In NG the intensity of obestatin immunostaining was significantly higher than that of ghrelin (p = 0.03). Conversely, ghrelin expression in MTC was definitely more evident than obestatin immunoreactivity (p < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between ghrelin and obestatin expression in PTC. No correlations were detected between reciprocal tissue expressions of ghrelin and obestatin in the analyzed specimens of NG, PTC or MTC.;The differences between ghrelin expression in NG and MTC suggest that ghrelin may be involved in thyroid cell proliferation. The differences between ghrelin and obestatin immunoreactivity in benign and malignant thyroid tumors could support the theory of alternative transcription of the preproghrelin gene and independent production of ghrelin and obestatin.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) are frequently associated with the t(2;5)(p23;q35). This translocation fuses the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene at 5q35, which encodes a nucleolar protein involved in shuttling ribonucleoproteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, to the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene at 2p23, encoding a tyrosine kinase receptor. In this report, we describe a typical case of ALCL whose malignant cells exhibited a novel (1;2)(q25;p23) translocation. These cells expressed ALK protein, but, in contrast to t(2;5)-positive ALCL (which show cytoplasmic, nuclear, and nucleolar staining), labeling was restricted to the malignant cell cytoplasm. Using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique to walk on chromosome 2 from the known ALK gene across the breakpoint, we showed that the gene involved at 1q25 is TPM3, encoding a nonmuscular tropomyosin. We subsequently identified, using reverse transcription-PCR analysis of cases showing similar ALK cytoplasm-restricted staining, fusion of the ALK and TPM3 genes in 2 other cases of ALCL. The TPM3 gene has been previously found in papillary thyroid carcinomas as a fusion partner with the TRK kinase gene. We showed that TPM3 is constitutively expressed in lymphoid cell lines, suggesting that, in these t(1;2)-bearing ALCL cases, the TPM3 gene contributes an active promoter for ALK expression. Activation of the ALK catalytic domain probably results from homodimerization of the hybrid protein TPM3-ALK, through the TPM3 protein-protein interaction domain. The present cases of ALCL associated with a novel t(1;2)(q25;p23) demonstrate that at least one fusion partner other than NPM can activate the intracytoplasmic domain of the ALK kinase.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy. Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) with the two subtypes, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), is the most frequent subtype of thyroid cancer; more rare subtypes are medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). The incidence of DTC has increased rapidly in recent years due to the more frequent use of imaging methods such as ultrasound of the neck and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of thyroid nodules. After total thyroidectomy and radioiodine treatment, DTC remains an indolent and curable disease in most patients, whereas the cure rate in MTC is lower and depends on early diagnosis. Most ATCs are incurable. In recent years, there has been great progress in identifying genetic changes in thyroid cancer, and genetic testing of FNA samples or blood samples provides useful information for clinical decision making. Tumor staging, either postoperatively or by imaging, and measuring the tumor markers thyroglobulin for DTC and calcitonin for MTC, allow for dynamic risk-adapted stratification for follow-up procedures. In advanced metastatic thyroid cancer, molecular targeted therapy using tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors, including sorafenib, lenvantinib, vandetanib, and cabozantinib, helps control tumor progression and prolongs progression-free survival. Using a dynamic risk-stratified approach to manage thyroid cancer, the outcomes for most thyroid cancer patients are excellent compared with those for other cancers. The major challenge in the future is to identify high-risk patients and to treat and monitor them appropriately.

In this order, a series of nodules histologically proven as MTC and a group of nodules with histology of papillary cancer (PTC) were retrospectively compared with a control group of benign nodule.

        "Doc_abstract":"Since medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) was first recognized as a distinct tumor in 1959, it became clear that MTC is more difficult to cure than papillary thyroid cancer and has higher rates of recurrence and mortality. MTC represents 5-8% of thyroid cancers. It derives from parafollicular cells of the ultimobranchial body derived from the neural crest. MTC secretes calcitonin and other hormonal peptides and is considered part of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxilation system. MTC may occur either as a hereditary or nonhereditary entity. Hereditary MTC can occur either alone as the familial MTC or as the thyroid manifestation of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes (MEN 2A MEN 2B). Activating point mutations of the RET proto-oncogene have demonstrated to be causative of the familial form of medullary thyroid cancer, both isolated familial MTC and associated with MEN 2A and 2B. In the last 10 years, major improvements and new technologies have been proposed and applied in thyroid surgery; among these are molecular diagnosis with genetic screening and mini-invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy. The history of thyroid surgery starts with Billroth, Kocher and Halsted, who developed the technique for thyroidectomy between 1873 and 1910. Prophylactic surgery for patients carrying a positive RET proto-oncogene has proven to be highly effective in curing those likely to experience the development of MTC. Video-assisted procedures with central compartment dissection have proved feasible for patients carrying a positive RET proto-oncogene. This paper reviews relevant medical literature published in the English language on surgery of MTC in well-controlled trials. We discuss the particular ethical and legal issues that thyroid prophylactic surgery raises. Searches were last updated in February 2007.",

        "Doc_abstract":"111In-octreotide scintigraphy in patients with persistent medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) visualized tumors in about half of the surgically explored sites. Tumor visualization correlated with rapid tumor growth and large tumor volume as judged from calcitonin levels. The 111In concentration ratio between tumor (T) and blood (B) in surgically excised lymph node metastases of MTC showed a large variation, with low values for microscopic and high values for macroscopic metastases in individual patients. Three cases of MTC, Hürthle cell adenoma and papillary thyroid cancer are reported with preoperative scintigraphy, T/B ratios and Northern analyses of the surgical biopsies. Visualization of tumors was possible in the absence of sstr2 (the high affinity receptor for octreotide) with the exception of microscopic tumor growth. T/B values in the patient with Hürthle cell adenoma were similar to those found in the contralateral thyroid lobe with goitre. The relatively high uptake of 111In in benign thyroid conditions probably limits the use of octreotide scintigraphy in the diagnosis of primary tumors. The technique has certain advantages over radioiodine scintigraphy after the surgical treatment of thyroid tumors: no need for withdrawal of thyroxin substitution; a possibility to diagnose metastases of tumors that do not concentrate radioiodine (MTC, Hürthle cell cancer); and complementary information about metastatic sites of non-medullary thyroid cancer (papillary and follicular tumors).",

We correlated mutation status with calcitonin and pathologic studies to determine genotype-phenotype correlations.;We identified a mutation in codon 804 in exon 14 (GTG-->ATG; V804M) in both families. An 86-year-old person who was a gene carrier and other individuals over age 70 who were suspected by pedigree analysis to be gene carriers had no overt clinical evidence of MTC. Four of 21 patients who underwent a thyroidectomy also had papillary thyroid cancer. One individual in each family had metastatic MTC at age 30 and 32 years, and all 26 people having thyroidectomies had either MTC or C-cell hyperplasia, leading us to continue to recommend prophylactic thyroidectomy for all identified patients who were gene carriers.;Because of active MTC in younger members of these families, including metastases, we have continued to advocate thyroid surgery in mutation-positive individuals. While DNA diagnosis of gene carriers and subsequent genetic counseling was relatively straightforward, the acceptance of surgical recommendations was more difficult for some individuals.

Geostatistics and geographic information system (GIS) tools have emerged as powerful geospatial technologies to identify disease clusters, map patterns and trends, and assess the impact of ecological and socioeconomic factors (SES) on the spatial distribution of diseases. In this study, these tools were used to analyze thyroid cancer incidence in a rural population.;Thyroid cancer incidence and socio-demographic factors in Vermont (VT), United States, between 1994 and 2007 were analyzed by logistic regression and geospatial and temporal analyses.;The thyroid cancer age-adjusted incidence in Vermont (8.0 per 100,000) was comparable to the national level (8.4 per 100,000), as were the ratio of the incidence of females to males (3.1:1) and the mortality rate (0.5 per 100,000). However, the estimated annual percentage change was higher (8.3 VT; 5.7 U.S.). Incidence among females peaked at 30-59 years of age, reflecting a significant rise from 1994 to 2007, while incidence trends for males did not vary significantly by age. For both females and males, the distribution of tumors by size did not vary over time; ≤1.0 cm, 1.1-2.0 cm, and >2.0 cm represented 38%, 22%, and 40%, respectively. In females, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) accounted for 89% of cases, follicular (FTC) 8%, medullary (MTC) 2%, and anaplastic (ATC) 0.6%, while in males PTC accounted for 77% of cases, FTC 15%, MTC 1%, and ATC 3%. Geospatial analysis revealed locations and spatial patterns that, when combined with multivariate incidence analyses, indicated that factors other than increased surveillance and access to healthcare (physician density or insurance) contributed to the increased thyroid cancer incidence. Nine thyroid cancer incidence hot spots, areas with very high normalized incidence, were identified based on zip code data. Those locations did not correlate with urban areas or healthcare centers.;These data provide evidence of increased thyroid cancer incidence in a rural population likely due to environmental drivers and SES.

NVP-AST487, a N,N'-diphenyl urea with an IC(50) of 0.88 mumol/L on RET kinase, inhibited RET autophosphorylation and activation of downstream effectors, and potently inhibited the growth of human thyroid cancer cell lines with activating mutations of RET but not of lines without RET mutations. NVP-AST487 induced a dose-dependent growth inhibition of xenografts of NIH3T3 cells expressing oncogenic RET, and of the MTC cell line TT in nude mice. MTCs secrete calcitonin, a useful indicator of tumor burden. Human plasma calcitonin levels derived from the TT cell xenografts were inhibited shortly after treatment, when tumor volume was still unchanged, indicating that the effects of RET kinase inhibition on calcitonin secretion were temporally dissociated from its tumor-inhibitory properties. Accordingly, NVP-AST487 inhibited calcitonin gene expression in vitro in TT cells, in part, through decreased gene transcription. These data point to a previously unknown physiologic role of RET signaling on calcitonin gene expression. Indeed, the RET ligands persephin and GDNF robustly stimulated calcitonin mRNA, which was blocked by pretreatment with NVP-AST487. Antagonists of RET kinase activity in patients with MTC may result in effects on plasma calcitonin that are either disproportionate or dissociated from the effects on tumor burden, because RET kinase mediates a physiologic pathway controlling calcitonin secretion. The role of traditional tumor biomarkers may need to be reassessed as targeted therapies designed against oncoproteins with key roles in pathogenesis are implemented.",

DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of a total of 330 persons, including 235 MTC patients and 95 of their unaffected kindred's. Exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the RET gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Sixty-seven people were found to carry pathogenic, germline mutations in the RET gene. In exon 10, C609F, C609R and C609Y (3 families), C618G, C618F (2 families), and C620G (4 families) mutations were identified. In exon 11, C634R (8 families) and C649L mutations (1 patient) were found. Five families carried Y791F mutation in exon 13. One patient with PTC revealed the presence of a Y791F mutation. In 3 families, exon 14 of the RET gene harbored the following mutations: V804L (1 patient), E819K (1 patient) and R844Q (1 patient). In 1 family, the S891A mutation was identified in exon 15, 3 families were found to carry mutations in exon16, R912P in 1 family and M918T in 2 families. In summary, of the 235 patients affected by MTC, 46 (19.6%) carried pathogenic RET gene mutations, 1 patient with RET mutation had kidney carcinoma, and 1 had PTC. The results show the occurrence of a variety of mutations prevalent in patients with MTC in the population of Central Poland. These results may contribute to a better diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"OBJECTIVE Postoperative shoulder imbalance (PSI) is a critical consideration after corrective surgery for a double thoracic curve (Lenke Type 2); however, the radiographic factors related to PSI remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify the radiographic factors related to PSI after corrective surgery for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) in patients with a double thoracic curve. METHODS This study included 80 patients with Lenke Type 2 AIS who underwent corrective surgery. Patients were grouped according to the presence [PSI(+)] or absence [PSI(-)] of shoulder imbalance at the final follow-up examination (differences of 20, 15, and 10 mm were used). Various radiographic parameters, including the Cobb angle of the proximal and middle thoracic curves (PTC and MTC), radiographic shoulder height (RSH), clavicle angle, T-1 tilt, trunk shift, and proximal and distal wedge angles (PWA and DWA), were assessed before and after surgery and compared between groups. RESULTS Overall, postoperative RSH decreased with time in the PSI(-) group but not in the PSI(+) group. Statistical analyses revealed that the preoperative Risser grade (p = 0.048), postoperative PWA (p = 0.028), and postoperative PTC/MTC ratio (p = 0.011) correlated with PSI. Presence of the adding-on phenomenon was also correlated with PSI, although this result was not statistically significant (p = 0.089). CONCLUSIONS Postoperative shoulder imbalance is common after corrective surgery for Lenke Type 2 AIS and correlates with a higher Risser grade, a larger postoperative PWA, and a higher postoperative PTC/MTC ratio. Presence of the distal adding-on phenomenon is associated with an increased PSI trend, although this result was not statistically significant. However, preoperative factors other than the Risser grade that affect the development of PSI were not identified by the study. Additional studies are required to reveal the risk factors for the development of PSI.",

        "Doc_abstract":"There is no consensus on the definition of a structural proximal thoracic curve (PTC) and the indications for fusion. As such, we assessed a single institute's experience in the management of large PTCs (>35 degrees) in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) who were either fused or not fused. A retrospective radiographic analyses of 30 consecutive AIS patients with double thoracic curves who underwent PSF with a minimum of 2 years' follow-up were included for review. The patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 15 patients) with fusion extended up to T2 or T3 and group 2 (n = 15) with fusion limited to T5 or below. Shoulder balance was assessed according to clavicular angle, first-rib difference, and radiographic shoulder height difference (SHD). PTCs were defined based on a Cobb angle of >35, the presence of apical rotation, and a positive T1 tilt. The decision to fuse the PTC was based on curve magnitude only, with those between 35 and 45 degrees undergoing a selective fusion of the main thoracic curve (MTC), with both curves fused if the PTC was more than 45 degrees. In group 1, there were eight females and seven males. Their ages ranged between 12 and 33 years, with a mean of 16.2 ± 5.5 years. Postoperatively, the mean PTC correction was 45.6%, which statistically differed from preoperative status (p = 0.001). No statistical difference was noted in T1 tilt and the first-rib difference from preoperative to postoperative follow-up (p > 0.05). However, the clavicular angle and SHD were increased significantly at the immediate postoperative interval (p < 0.05) but demonstrated no significant changes between the initial and the last follow-up values (p > 0.05). Group 2 consisted of one male and 14 females. The mean age was 16.4 ± 4 years (range: 11 to 28 years). The mean spontaneous PTC correction was 28.3% and remained essentially unchanged at the end of the follow-up. The improvement in the curve from preoperative status was highly statistically significant (p = 0.001). All radiographic shoulder parameters exhibited a significant increase in the immediate postoperative period and at last follow-up, and shoulder balance improvement was not noted on follow-up. Although both groups were not statistically similar with regards to the preoperative PTC, AVR, apical vertebral translation, and shoulder parameters, no significant difference could be found in PTC or shoulder parameters between both groups at last follow-up (p > 0.05). Our study illustrates important observations that should be considered in defining the PTC for fusion consideration. Spontaneous correction of the PTC occurs in structural curves greater than 35 degrees and less than 45 degrees, and this correction is maintained over time. Despite that correction, radiographic shoulder parameters are expected to slightly increase. Nonfusion strategy may be appropriate for PTCs between 35 and 45 degrees. After fusion of both the MTC and the PTC, the radiographic shoulder parameters did not significantly differ. Preoperative radiographic shoulder parameters are not predictive of postoperative shoulder imbalance. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The study of thyroid tumor genetics has great relevance to surgeons and facilitates understanding tumor pathogenesis, prediction of tumor behavior, and management decisions. The genes implicated can be broadly categorized as oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes. The RET oncogene has well established roles in the development of both papillary (PTC) and medullary (MTC) thyroid carcinoma. Genetic screening for germline RET mutations in members of multiple endocrine neoplasia type II (MEN-II) families is now widely performed, and prophylactic thyroidectomy in gene carriers is advisable at an early age. Patients with apparently sporadic MTC can also be screened to rule out familial disease. The demonstration of a RET rearrangement in a patient's PTC may have prognostic significance, but as yet there are no management implications. The thyrotropin receptor (TSH-R) and Gsalpha become oncogenic through point mutation and are associated with the development of toxic thyroid adenomas. The ras oncogene is implicated in the early stages of development of several thyroid tumor types. Tumor-suppressor genes also have a role in thyroid tumor formation. The p53 gene appears to be involved in the process of transformation to the anaplastic phenotype and the PTEN gene in the development of follicular adenomas but not carcinomas. There is still limited evidence for the so called adenoma-carcinoma sequence of the thyroid follicular cell. Loss of heterozygosity studies have enabled identification of tumor-suppressor genes, and their findings suggests differences in the pathogenesis of PTCs compared with follicular cancers. Surgical decision-making will benefit from these basic molecular advances, which rapidly translates into improved patient management.",

The influence, exerted by exogenous IGF-I on the expression of these genes, was also investigated.;Thyroid tissue specimens were obtained from 65 patients during subtotal or total thyroidectomies. After approximately 2-3 weeks of culture, thyroid cells were incubated for 24 hours with IGF-I in concentrations of: 0, 1, 10 and 100 ng/ml. The total mRNA was isolated according to the method described by Chomczyński and Sacchi with our own modifications. Afterwards, mRNA encoding IGF-I, IGFBP-1-IGFBP-4 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), were amplified, using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); GAPDH gene served as a control gene. PCR products were electrophoresed and then submitted to densitometric analysis.;Our study has shown that in carcinoma cells (ATC, PTC, MTC), IGF-I reveals a stimulatory influence on the expression of its own gene, that effect being most distinctive in ATC cells.

Although most patients have a favorable prognosis, over 1,500 people will die from thyroid carcinoma each year. The spectrum of disease types range from papillary thyroid cancer, which is a well-differentiated indolent tumor, to anaplastic carcinoma, a poorly differentiated fulminant cancer. With advances in diagnostic methods, surgical techniques, and clinical care of patients with thyroid carcinoma, the current management of thyroid cancer demands a multidisciplinary approach. The majority of patients with well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma of follicular cell origin are cured with adequate surgical management; however, some thyroid malignancies such as medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas frequently metastasize, precluding patients from a curative resection. As such, novel palliative and therapeutic strategies are needed for this patient population. Here, we explore the current management of thyroid carcinoma, including surgical management of the primary tumor, lymph node disease, and locoregional recurrence. Likewise, we explore the application of current molecular techniques, reviewing nearly two decades of data that have begun to elucidate critical genetic pathways and therapeutic drug targets which may be important in specific thyroid tumor types.",

The aim of this study was to provide this information.
