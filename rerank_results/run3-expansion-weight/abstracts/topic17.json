        "Doc_abstract":"p53 alterations at the DNA, mRNA and protein levels were studied in tumour metastases sampled from 30 patients with malignant melanoma. Paraffin-embedded sections from these and an additional 12 patients were examined for the presence of p53 protein. TP53 gene aberrations were found in 7 of 30 (23%) of the patients, six of which showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Point mutations were detected in only two cases, one of which had LOH whereas the other was non-informative. Increased levels of p53 mRNA were present in only one tumour with, but in six cases without, detectable DNA abnormalities. Four of the latter and six tumours with normal transcript levels had immunohistochemically detectable levels of p53 protein. In 25 cases in which corresponding primary and metastatic lesions could be compared, closely similar immunoreactivity patterns were observed. Increased expression of the MDM2 gene was found in only one tumour in parallel with overexpression of p53. Altogether, the data indicate that inactivation of the p53 regulatory pathway is not of major significance in the tumorigenesis of malignant melanoma. However, a significant association was found between p53 immunoreactivity and the relapse-free period in patients with superficial spreading melanoma. That increased protein expression was predominantly found in tumours without DNA alterations might suggest a role for the wild-type p53 protein in restricting malignant cell proliferation in these cases.",

Archival tissues from 29 patients with mucosal melanomas and from 27 with cutaneous melanomas in facial skin were subjected to immunohistochemical procedures using the monoclonal antibody DO-1. p53p expression did not differ significantly between the two groups of melanomas. A comparison with previously obtained data on TP53 mutations from the same tumours showed closer concordance amongst mucosal than amongst skin tumours. Primary mucosal melanomas and their satellites showed identical patterns, focal or diffuse, of p53p expression. Thus, expression of altered p53p could well participate in the clonal expansion of these mucosal melanomas and in tumour progression. The p53p characteristics recognized in our investigations are amongst the first hallmarks in the emerging molecular pathological profiling of mucosal melanomas, and may therefore be useful in exploring the aetiology of UV-independent melanomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cutaneous melanoma is epidemiologically linked to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), but the molecular mechanisms by which UVR drives melanomagenesis remain unclear. The most common somatic mutation in melanoma is a V600E substitution in BRAF, which is an early event. To investigate how UVR accelerates oncogenic BRAF-driven melanomagenesis, we used a BRAF(V600E) mouse model. In mice expressing BRAF(V600E) in their melanocytes, a single dose of UVR that mimicked mild sunburn in humans induced clonal expansion of the melanocytes, and repeated doses of UVR increased melanoma burden. Here we show that sunscreen (UVA superior, UVB sun protection factor (SPF) 50) delayed the onset of UVR-driven melanoma, but only provided partial protection. The UVR-exposed tumours showed increased numbers of single nucleotide variants and we observed mutations (H39Y, S124F, R245C, R270C, C272G) in the Trp53 tumour suppressor in approximately 40% of cases. TP53 is an accepted UVR target in human non-melanoma skin cancer, but is not thought to have a major role in melanoma. However, we show that, in mice, mutant Trp53 accelerated BRAF(V600E)-driven melanomagenesis, and that TP53 mutations are linked to evidence of UVR-induced DNA damage in human melanoma. Thus, we provide mechanistic insight into epidemiological data linking UVR to acquired naevi in humans. Furthermore, we identify TP53/Trp53 as a UVR-target gene that cooperates with BRAF(V600E) to induce melanoma, providing molecular insight into how UVR accelerates melanomagenesis. Our study validates public health campaigns that promote sunscreen protection for individuals at risk of melanoma. ",

We investigated whether XPO1 is a potential therapeutic target in melanoma using novel selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE). In vitro effects of SINE on cell growth and apoptosis were measured by MTS assay and flow cytometry [Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI)], respectively in human metastatic melanoma cell lines. Immunoblot analysis was used to measure nuclear localization of key cellular proteins. The in vivo activity of oral SINE was evaluated in NOD/SCID mice bearing A375 or CHL-1 human melanoma xenografts. SINE compounds induced cytostatic and pro-apoptotic effects in both BRAF wild type and mutant (V600E) cell lines at nanomolar concentrations. The cytostatic and pro-apoptotic effects of XPO1 inhibition were associated with nuclear accumulation of TP53, and CDKN1A induction in the A375 cell line with wild type TP53, while pMAPK accumulated in the nucleus regardless of TP53 status. The orally bioavailable KPT-276 and KPT-330 compounds significantly inhibited growth of A375 (p<0.0001) and CHL-1 (p = 0.0087) human melanoma cell lines in vivo at well tolerated doses.

Contrastingly, the closely related gene CDKN2B had no disease-related mutations in these families. A majority of Swedish families with hereditary melanoma predisposition thus lack germline mutations in these cell cycle G1 checkpoint-regulating genes. Additional genes with the potential to contribute to increased melanoma risk may code for related components of the cell cycle-regulating machinery. The gene for cyclin-dependent kinase 4, CDK4, has been found in mutated form in the germline from individuals belonging to 2 melanoma kindreds in the United States. The CDKN2C gene coding for the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p18 is localized on 1p32, a region frequently involved in chromosomal changes in melanomas and other tumors. The TP53 suppressor gene, involved in cell cycle regulation and maintenance of genetic stability, is found mutated in the germline of patients with hereditary Li-Fraumeni syndrome, leading to early onset of several human cancers, including melanoma. The present investigation reports the results of screening the 100 Swedish melanoma families for germline mutations in the CDK4, CDKN2C and TP53 genes.

In this study, we showed that both p53 protein and activity levels in melanoma cells were strongly induced by nutlin-3, a canonical HDM2 antagonist. Among a test panel of 51 cell lines, there was a marked reduction in melanoma viability that was directly linked to TP53 status. Moreover, we also found that the melanoma growth suppression mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibition was potentiated by HDM2 antagonism.

In all, 41 melanoma obtained from eight primary lesions, 20 nodal, 11 cutaneous and two visceral metastases from patients with sporadic (n=31), familial (n=4) and multiple melanoma (n=2) were analysed. The results revealed novel missense mutations in the BRAF, PTEN, CDKN2A and CDK4 genes. Overall, activating mutations of BRAF and loss of functional p16 and ARF were detected in the majority of melanomas (29/41, 36/41 and 29/41, respectively), while PTEN alterations/loss, NRAS and TP53 mutations occurred less frequently (6/41, 6/41 and 10/41, respectively). In the resulting 12 mutational profiles, p16/ARF loss associated with mutated BRAFV599E was the most represented (n=15). In addition, TP53 and PTEN mutations were always accompanied with BRAF alterations, while PTEN loss was found in association with CDKN2A or TP53 mutations in the absence of BRAF activation. The p16/ARFDelta+BRAF/RAS profile was significantly associated with a longer survival, while complex mutational profiles were detected in highly aggressive disease and poor survival.

In most LFS kindreds germline TP53 mutations have been identified. In general, TP53 germline mutations are not associated with late-onset common cancers. We encountered a large kindred in which a wide spectrum of tumour types occurred, including melanoma, breast, ovarian, colorectal, stomach and renal cell cancer, without clear-cut early ages at onset of disease. An Arg213Gln TP53 germline mutation was detected in 12 out of 15 affected family members whereas testing for other cancer susceptibility genes in selected patients was negative. In vitro testing indicated that the specific TP53 mutation inactivates the protein transcriptionally. Our findings suggest that this TP53 germline mutation is a causative factor in this family and that specific TP53 germline mutations can be associated with relatively late-onset common cancers.",

In addition, 6 variants of unknown signification were identified in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Regarding family history, 3/13 (23%) patients with a positive family history of BC or CMM were carriers of a germline mutation, whereas only 3/69 (4%) patients without family history were carriers of a germline mutation.;Our findings show that few patients with BC and CMM who lacked family histories of these cancers are carriers of deleterious germline mutations in four of the five genes we examined.

In this review, we will describe different p53 mutation spectra, in relation to the various histopathological types of skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and malignant melanoma as well as to the DNA repair efficiency of the patients. In particular, different mutational hot spots are found among the various spectra. We have tried to elucidate them in terms of induced DNA lesion hot spots, as well as speed of local nucleotide excision repair (NER) or sequence effects.

Given that p53 is capable of antagonising PI3K/AKT activation we hypothesised that pharmacological restoration of p53 activity may increase the sensitivity of BRAF-mutant melanoma to MAPK-targeted therapy and eventually delay and/or prevent acquisition of drug resistance. To test this possibility we exposed a panel of vemurafenib-sensitive and resistant (innate and acquired) (V600E/K)BRAF melanomas to a (V600E/K)BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) alone or in combination with a direct p53 activator (PRIMA-1(Met)/APR-246). Strikingly, PRIMA-1(Met) synergised with vemurafenib to induce apoptosis and suppress proliferation of (V600E/K)BRAF melanoma cells in vitro and to inhibit tumour growth in vivo. Importantly, this drug combination decreased the viability of both vemurafenib-sensitive and resistant melanoma cells irrespectively of the TP53 status. Notably, p53 reactivation was invariably accompanied by PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition, the activity of which was found as a dominant resistance mechanism to BRAF inhibition in our lines. From all various combinatorial modalities tested, targeting the MAPK and PI3K signalling pathways through p53 reactivation or not, the PRIMA-1(Met)/vemurafenib combination was the most cytotoxic. We conclude that PRIMA-1(Met) through its ability to directly reactivate p53 regardless of the mechanism causing its deactivation, and thereby dampen PI3K signalling, sensitises (V600E/K)BRAF-positive melanoma to BRAF inhibitors.",

Differentiation may be an alternative to apoptosis for inducing melanoma cell cycle exit. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate differentiation, and DNA methylation alterations are associated with the abnormal differentiation of melanoma cells. The effects of the deoxycytidine analogue decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine), which depletes DNA methyl transferase 1 (DNMT1), on melanoma differentiation were examined. Treatment of human and murine melanoma cells in vitro with concentrations of decitabine that did not cause apoptosis inhibited proliferation accompanied by cellular differentiation. A decrease in promoter methylation, and increase in expression of the melanocyte late-differentiation driver SOX9, was followed by increases in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKN) p27/CDKN1B and p21/CDKN1A that mediate cell cycle exit with differentiation. Effects were independent of the TP53, p16/CDKN2A and also the BRAF status of the melanoma cells. Resistance, when observed, was pharmacologic, characterized by diminished ability of decitabine to deplete DNMT1. Treatment of murine melanoma models in vivo with intermittent, low-dose decitabine, administered sub-cutaneously to limit high peak drug levels that cause cytotoxicity and increase exposure time for DNMT1 depletion, and with tetrahydrouridine to decrease decitabine metabolism and further increase exposure time, inhibited tumor growth and increased molecular and tumor stromal factors implicated in melanocyte differentiation.

Melanomas also commonly show impairment of the p16(INK4A)-CDK4-Rb and ARF-HDM2-p53 tumor suppressor pathways. CDKN2A mutations can produce p16(INK4A) and ARF protein loss. Rb bypass can also occur through activating CDK4 mutations as well as by CDK4 amplification. In addition to ARF deletion, p53 pathway disruption can result from dominant negative TP53 mutations.

We analysed the DNA from 39 patients with primary and metastatic melanomas, and from 9 melanoma cell lines.;The SSCP technique showed heterozygous defects in the p53 gene in 8 of 39 (20.5%) melanoma tumors: three point mutations in intron sequences (introns 1 and 2) and exon 10, and three new polymorphisms located in introns 1 and 2 (C to T transition at position 11701 in intron 1; C insertion at position 11818 in intron 2; and C insertion at position 11875 in intron 2). One melanoma tumor exhibited two heterozygous alterations in the p16 exon 1 (stop codon and missense mutation). No defects were found in the remaining genes. Homozygous deletions were more frequent in melanoma cell lines than in melanoma tumors in p21, p16 and p15 (22.2%, 44.4%, and 44.4% versus 7.7%, 2.5%, and 5.1% respectively). TP53 did not show homozygous deletions.;Our results suggest that these genes are involved in melanoma tumorigenesis; but perhaps not in the major targets.

Notably, clinical studies revealed the distinct features in the Chinese population differing from those in Caucasians, which give hints to variant mechanisms underlying. Therefore, it is of great importance to generate a cell line with similar background for melanoma research in Chinese even Asian patients. However, most melanoma cell lines in use are derived from Caucasians, thus, we established one novel metastatic melanoma cell line, FLFMM-34, derived from a Han Chinese woman. The cell line showed positive for S100, HMB45, vimentin and melan-A. Chromosome analysis revealed multiple structural aberrations. Gene-mutation analysis identified that FLFMM-34 cells had BRAF(V600E) mutation and deletions of exon 2 and 3 in p16/CDKN2A. Importantly, two novel mutations including TP53(P33R) and TP53(R142H) have been detected. RT-PCR results showed that FLFMM-34 cells expressed a higher mRNA level of cyclinD1 than three other melanoma cell lines, WM793B, 1205Lu and A2058. In addition, in vivo mice model demonstrated that the cells could be transplanted into the subcutis of nude mice and produced tumors associated with lymphoid node metastases. In conclusion, these data indicate that FLFMM-34 cell line can be employed as a suitable model for melanoma research in Chinese Han population. ",

Previous studies showed that jararhagin, from the Bothrops jararaca snake venom, induces changes in the morphology and viability of SK-Mel-28 human melanoma cells, and decreases the number of metastases in mice injected with pre-treated cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the molecular effects of jararhagin on SK-Mel-28 cells and fibroblasts, concerning the expression of integrins, cadherins, caspases, and TP53 genes. Sub-toxic doses of jararhagin were administered to confluent cells. RT-PCR was performed following extraction of total RNA. Jararhagin treatments induced similar morphological alterations in both normal and tumor cells, with higher IC50 values for fibroblasts. Integrin genes were downregulated in untreated cells, except for ITGA6a,b, ITGAv, and ITGB3 which were highly expressed in SK-Mel-28. The integrin expression profiles were not affected by the toxin. However, jararhagin 30ng/μl upregulated genes TP53, CDKN1A, CDKN2A, CASP3, CASP5, CASP6, CASP8, and E-CDH in SK-Mel-28, and genes ITGB6, ITGB7, CASP3, TP53, and CDKN1B in fibroblasts.

Distinct copy number alterations were detected, including loss or gain of whole chromosomes but also minute amplifications and homozygous deletions. Most common overlapping regions with losses were mapped to 9p24.3-q13, 10 and 11q14.1-qter, whereas copy number gains were most frequent on chromosomes 1q, 7, 17q and 20q. Amplifications were delineated to oncogenes such as MITF (3p14), CCND1 (11q13), MDM2 (12q15), CCNE1 (19q12) and NOTCH2 (1p12). Frequent findings of homozygous deletions on 9p21 and 10q23 confirmed the importance of CDKN2A and PTEN. Pair-wise comparisons revealed distinct sets of alterations, for example, mutually exclusive mutations in BRAF and NRAS, mutual mutations in BRAF and PTEN, concomitant chromosome 7 gain and 10 loss and concomitant chromosome 15q22.2-q26.3 gain and 20 gain.

        "Doc_abstract":"Malignant melanoma is a cancer characterized by high chemoresistance although p53 is rarely mutated. Here, we show that p53 wild-type melanoma cells acquire resistance to cell death induced by fotemustine (FM), which is a representative of alkylating DNA interstrand cross-linking agents used in melanoma therapy. We show that drug-induced resistance is a result of p53-dependent upregulation of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC) and damaged DNA-binding protein 2 (DDB2), which stimulate the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) arising from O(6)-chloroethylguanine. Consequently, TP53 mutated cells are unable to repair ICLs, leading to prolonged ATM, ATR and checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) activation, and finally apoptosis. The roles of p53 and NER in ICL-triggered cell death were confirmed by knockdown of p53 and XPC. Upregulation of XPC and DDB2 in p53wt cells following a single drug treatment is a robust and sustained response that lasts for up to 1 week. Pretreatment with an inducing dose followed by a high and toxic dose of FM provoked an adaptive response as the killing outcome of the challenge dose was reduced. Upregulation of XPC and DDB2 was also observed in a melanoma mouse xenograft model following systemic administration of FM. Additionally, XPC and DDB2 induction occurred upon treatment with other cross-linking anticancer drugs, such as cisplatin and mafosfamide, indicating it is a general response of cancer cells to this group of chemotherapeutics. Collectively, the data indicate that p53-dependent upregulation of XPC and DDB2 is a key mechanism upon genotoxic stress, whereby melanoma cells acquire resistance towards DNA cross-linking agents. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of upregulation of NER following a single dose of a DNA interstrand cross-linker, which is a robust and long-lasting effect that impacts the killing response of cancer cells to subsequent treatments.

Cells were labelled for pericentrin (a centrosomal marker), DNA and α-tubulin, and scored for centrosome morphology, supernumerary centrosomes, and mitotic symmetry. The incidence of supernumerary centrosomes correlated with that of gross centrosomal abnormalities (r = 0.90), mitotic asymmetry (r = 0.90), and, surprisingly, increased content of G/M cells (r = 0.79). Centrosomal numerical dysregulation, observed in all cell lines, was found not to be specifically related to the status of any of the characterized gene mutations that were found in 13/15 cell lines.

Older acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with high expression of both miR-3151 and the BAALC mRNA transcript have a low survival prognosis, and miR-3151 and BAALC expression is associated with poor survival independently of each other. We found that miR-3151 functioned as the oncogenic driver of the BAALC/miR-3151 locus. Increased production of miR-3151 reduced the apoptosis and chemosensitivity of AML cell lines and increased leukemogenesis in mice. Disruption of the TP53-mediated apoptosis pathway occurred in leukemia cells overexpressing miR-3151 and the miR-3151 bound to the 3' untranslated region of TP53. In contrast, BAALC alone had only limited oncogenic activity. We found that miR-3151 contains its own regulatory element, thus partly uncoupling miR-3151 expression from that of the BAALC transcript. Both genes were bound and stimulated by a complex of the transcription factors SP1 and nuclear factor κB (SP1/NF-κB). Disruption of SP1/NF-κB binding reduced both miR-3151 and BAALC expression. However, expression of only BAALC, but not miR-3151, was stimulated by the transcription factor RUNX1, suggesting a mechanism for the partly discordant expression of miR-3151 and BAALC observed in AML patients. Similar to the AML cells, in melanoma cell lines, overexpression of miR-3151 reduced the abundance of TP53, and knockdown of miR-3151 increased caspase activity, whereas miR-3151 overexpression reduced caspase activity. Thus, this oncogenic miR-3151 may also have a role in solid tumors. ",

For a panel of six melanoma cell lines we performed transcript sequence analysis of the entire coding region and determined p53 protein stability and messenger RNA stability by western blot experiments and quantitative reverse-transcription-PCR, respectively. Transcript levels of p53 modifying genes as well as p53 target genes were investigated after ultraviolet irradiation, interferon-α-2b, and chemotherapy (cisplatin or dacarbazine) by quantitative reverse-transcription-PCR. Transcript sequence analysis identified three aberrations in three of six melanomas. Four of six melanomas showed high-constitutive p53 protein levels. p53 transcripts remained stable in four of six melanomas. All p53-expressing melanomas displayed high p53 protein stability. Constitutively, and after ultraviolet irradiation, mouse double min-2 expression was reduced in melanomas. We detected high homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 level in melanomas-expressing mutant p53. Most experimental conditions resulted in lower expression of p21, GADD45A, and PUMA, and a higher expression of CDC2 in melanomas. Altogether, accumulation of p53 protein is due to posttranslational modification or aberrant expression of p53 modifiers. p53 is functionally disrupted although the p53 upstream signaling pathway remains inducible.",

Forty-five of 53 (85%) specimens from a range of primary and metastatic melanomas were found to have detectable evidence of p53 gene mutation, by virtue of the immunohistochemical detection of mutant p53 protein. Significantly increased prevalence of mutant p53 was found in metastatic melanoma, compared with primary tumors (P less than 0.05).

Studies of cell cycle and proliferation-associated proteins may help in the understanding of the genesis of melanomas. The tumour suppressor gene TP53 has been shown to be involved in melanomas. However, the incidence of TP53 malfunction in cutaneous melanoma is unclear, and other regulators of cell cycle control are likely to be involved in both the development and progression of melanocytic neoplasia. A candidate is the ING1 gene, which co-operates with TP53 in growth suppression and apoptosis. Thus loss of ING1 function may have similar consequences to loss of TP53 function and may contribute to tumorigenesis. Therefore we have studied the expression of p33ING1b protein in cutaneous melanocytic neoplasia.;Sixty-seven melanocytic lesions were studied by immunohistochemistry for the expression of p33ING1b. In our series there was loss of nuclear p33ING1b expression in invasive malignant melanoma compared with normal cutaneous melanocytes or the melanocytes of benign melanocytic naevi. This was associated with an enhancement of cytoplasmic p33ING1b expression which was particularly prominent in invasive malignant melanoma.;Cytoplasmic immunostaining for p33ING1b using MAb GN2 is strongly associated with 'activated' melanocytic lesions; therefore it is possible that this MAb could be of value in diagnostic practice. Furthermore, the reduction in p33ING1b expression and perhaps translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm may play a central role in the development and progression of melanomas.",

It is believed that the ability to evade apoptosis is the key mechanism for the rapid growth of cancer cells. However, the exact mechanism for failure in the apoptotic pathway in melanoma cells is unclear. p53, the most frequently mutated tumour suppressor gene in human cancers, is a key apoptosis inducer. However, p53 mutation is only found in 15-20% of melanoma biopsies. Recently, it was found that Apaf-1, a downstream target of p53, is inactivated in metastatic melanoma. Specifically, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the Apaf-1 gene was found in 40% of metastatic melanoma. To determine if loss of Apaf-1 expression is indeed involved in melanoma progression, we employed the tissue microarray technology and examined Apaf-1 expression in 70 human primary malignant melanoma biopsies by immunohistochemistry. Our data showed that Apaf-1 expression is significantly reduced in melanoma cells compared with normal nevi (chi(2)=6.02, P=0.014). Our results also revealed that loss of Apaf-1 was not associated with the tumour thickness, ulceration or subtype, patient's gender, age and 5-year survival. In addition, our in vitro apoptosis assay revealed that overexpression of Apaf-1 can sensitise melanoma cells to anticancer drug treatment.

However, high levels of p53 were detected in all cell lines, including melanoma cells with wild-type p53, with the exception of one line with a truncated form. Upon UV induction, p53 accumulated in lines with wild-type p53, and p53 target genes p21Cip1/Waf1, GADD45, and mdm2 were induced, but the induction of p21Cip1/Waf1 was significantly delayed as compared with the increase in p53 DNA-binding activity. However, despite p53 target gene induction, p53 DNA-binding activity was absent in one melanoma line with wild-type p53, and p53 target genes were induced also in cells with mutant p53. In response to UV, DNA replication ceased in all cell lines, and apoptosis ensued in four lines independently of p53 but correlated with high induction of GADD45. The results suggest that in melanoma, several p53 regulatory steps are dislodged; its basal expression is high, its activation in response to UV damage is diminished, and the regulation of its target genes p21Cip1/Waf1 and GADD45 are dissociated from p53 regulation.",

Genotyping was performed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism, pyrosequencing, and allelic discrimination. We found an increased risk for hereditary melanoma in MDM2 GG homozygotes, which was more pronounced among women (P=0.035). In the event of pairwise combinations of the single nucleotide polymorphisms, a risk elevation was shown for MDM2 GG homozygotes/p53 wild-type Arg in hereditary melanoma (P=0.01). Individuals with sporadic melanomas of the superficial spreading type, including melanoma in situ, showed a slightly higher frequency of the MDM2 GG genotype compared with those with nodular melanomas (P=0.04).

However, the mechanisms involved remain to be fully elucidated. In this report, we show that one of the MAGE proteins, MAGE-D2, suppresses the expression of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) death receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2) and plays an important role in protecting melanoma cells from apoptosis induced by TRAIL. MAGE-D2 was commonly expressed at increased levels in melanoma cells compared with melanocytes. Although its inhibition by small interfering RNA (siRNA) did not cause cell death, it rendered melanoma cells more sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. This was associated with enhanced formation of TRAIL death-inducing signaling complex and up-regulation of TRAIL-R2, and was blocked by a recombinant TRAIL-R2/Fc chimeric protein or siRNA knockdown of TRAIL-R2. Regulation of TRAIL-R2 by MAGE-D2 appeared to be mediated by p53, in that knockdown MAGE-D2 did not up-regulate TRAIL-R2 in p53-null or mutant p53 melanoma cells. In addition, inhibition of MAGE-D2 did not result in up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 in wild-type p53 cell lines with p53 inhibited by short hairpin RNA. Indeed, knockdown of MAGE-D2 led to up-regulation of p53 due to a transcriptional increase. The regulatory effect of MAGE-D2 on TRAIL-R2 expression and TRAIL-induced apoptosis was recapitulated in studies on fresh melanoma isolates. Taken together, these results identify the expression of MAGE-D2 as an important mechanism that inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis and suggest that targeting MAGE-D2 may be a useful strategy in improving the therapeutic efficacy of TRAIL in melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Metastasis by thin melanomas is uncommon and unpredictable. In order to assess the prognostic value of p53 expression, p53 immunohistochemical staining was evaluated in 20 thin melanomas with documented metastasis and in 20 control tumours which failed to metastasize. Tumours selected were less than 1 mm thick and were individually matched for tumour thickness, date of excision and patient age and sex. The relative risk of metastasis given p53 overexpression was 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.4-5.3; p = 0.53). Further quantitative analysis for p53 between the two groups did not demonstrate a significant difference (p = 0.08). These results are consistent with there being no association between p53 overexpression in thin melanomas and risk of metastasis, however, the sample size was small, and the existence of such an association cannot be ruled out with confidence. For the 20 thin melanomas which metastasized, there was no association between the proportion of cells positive for p53 and length of the relapse-free period (correlation coefficient = 0.02, p = 0.94).",

        "Doc_abstract":"Metastatic malignant melanoma is notorious for its phenotypic diversity and loss of differentiation markers. We herein summarized our experience with 14 metastatic melanomas showing complete loss of immunohistochemical melanocytic markers (with or without heterologous differentiation). Patients included 11 men and 3 women aged 24 to 78 years (median, 67 y). Thirteen patients had histologically confirmed primary skin melanoma, and 1 had metastatic melanoma of unknown primary. Undifferentiated metastasis was diagnosed synchronous to primary tumor (n=1), following skin melanoma by 3 months to 9 years (n=11) and preceding it by 1 year (n=1). Sites of undifferentiated metastases were axillary (3), inguinal (1), or submandibular (1) lymph nodes, digestive tract (2), bone/soft tissue (2), lung/pleura (2), and disseminated (n=3). Histology of metastases mimicked undifferentiated pleomorphic or spindle cell sarcoma with variable myxoid and giant cell areas (n=10) and cytokeratin-positive undifferentiated small cell sarcoma (n=1). Three cases showed heterologous dedifferentiation: pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma (n=1), teratocarcinosarcoma-like with prominent rhabdomyoblasts (n=1), and adenocarcinoma-like with metaplastic bone (n=1). All cases were negative for S100, melanoma cocktail, HMB45, Melan A, and SOX10. Other markers showed following results: smooth muscle actin (1/14), p16 (1/14), TP53 (2/12), pancytokeratin (4/14), desmin (5/14), h-caldesmon (0/9), and MDM2/CDK4 (0/5). SMARCB1 was intact in 8/8 cases. Genotyping showed BRAF(V600E) mutation (5/14), NRAS mutation (5/14), and BRAF/NRAS wild-type (4/14). In conclusion, undifferentiated/dedifferentiated metastatic melanoma is likely underrecognized and frequently mistaken for undifferentiated sarcoma or other neoplasms. Diagnosis of undifferentiated sarcoma at sites where melanoma metastasis are frequent (eg, inguinal and axillary region) should be made with great caution and warrants exploration of the remote history. Genotyping is a helpful surrogate marker in classifying such difficult cases. In the light of available targeted therapies, recognition of undifferentiated/dedifferentiated metastatic melanoma is mandatory for appropriate treatment.",

Intriguingly, the p53 tumor suppressor, a main mediator of chemoresistance in other tumor types, is rarely mutated in melanoma. However, we have previously shown that anti-apoptotic isoforms of p73 (deltaTA-p73), another member of the p53 family, are overexpressed in metastatic melanomas. DeltaTA-p73 can oppose the pro-apoptotic functions of p53 and full length p73, and thus it could contribute to melanoma chemoresistance. In this study, we use an efficient adenoviral-based gene transfer approach to introduce a transcriptionally active form of p73 (TA-p73beta) in melanoma cells, with the objective of overcoming drug resistance. Interestingly, TA-p73beta significantly sensitized 5 out of 7 aggressive melanoma cell lines to the standard therapeutic agents adriamycin and cisplatin. More importantly, TA-p73beta displayed a synergistic effect in vivo allowing adriamycin or cisplatin to block melanoma cell growth in mouse xenograft models (p < 0.05). In summary, our data show that Ad-mediated TA-p73beta gene expression can markedly sensitize a subset of melanoma cell lines to adriamycin and cisplatin in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a new chemosensitization strategy for malignant melanomas.",

The direct correlation between serum MIA levels of patients with progressing melanomas and tumor load supports a role for MIA as a melanoma progression factor. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), activating ras mutation, or loss of p53 function on MIA expression and release from melanoma cells. We previously showed that transfection of a mutant constitutively active ras into the melanoma cell line, WM35, induces a phenotypic change from radial to vertical growth, exhibiting increased proliferation and migration. Here, we report that MIA release was elevated in a ras-transfected cell line. In addition, loss of functional p53, using a dominant negative construct, substantially lowered the level of MIA release compared to control. UVR stimulated release of MIA into the extracellular compartment in both the control and ras-transfected cell lines. In addition, MIA mRNA was increased following UVR in all cell lines tested. By inducing either apoptosis or necrosis, we were able to confirm that MIA protein is not released from cells due to cell death alone. We have identified a transcriptional effect of UVR on MIA expression and have shown that release of MIA protein is dependent upon functional p53. We propose that UVR-induced production and release of MIA may promote the detachment of radial and vertical growth phase melanomas from basement membrane or matrix proteins, serving as a unique progression mechanism for melanoma.",

A possible approach to more effective therapy is induction of p53-dependent apoptosis. This approach is promising, since the wild-type p53 is expressed in most melanomas. An attempt was made to estimate the functional activity of p53 in several malignant melanoma cell lines. Most lines were characterized by a high protein level and nuclear localization of p53. All cell lines expressing the wild-type p53 showed stabilization of p53, its translocation into the nucleus, and activation of several target genes in response to DNA-damaging agents, suggesting that p53 was functionally active. A high-molecular-weight protein localized in the cytoplasm and mimicking a p53 epitope was found in several cell lines. It was shown that the DO-1 epitope of this protein does not derive from p53, ruling out cytoplasmic retention of p53 in melanoma cell lines. A mechanism of camptothecin-induced stabilization of p53 by decreasing the level of the HDM2 mRNA was described for melanoma cells but not for normal melanocytes, which suggested a differential effect of camptothecin on tumor-derived and primary cells.",

One hundred and seventeen primary melanomas and 18 metastatic tissue samples were analysed for immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67, Bcl-2 and p53. The staining results were correlated with disease progression and clinical outcome. The patient population comprised patients diagnosed with melanoma between 1988 and 1991. The clinical follow-up period for disease recurrence was 4.6 years (median; range, 0.2-7.5 years) and the follow-up period for overall survival was 10.0 years (median; range, 8.6-15.6 years). Ki-67 expression was not a prognostic factor in primary melanoma. High Bcl-2 expression was associated with such adverse prognostic factors as male gender, old age of the patient and tumour ulceration. High Bcl-2 expression was also associated with an adverse prognosis in intermediate-thickness (1.01-4.0 mm) melanomas (n=52) for disease-free (P=0.09) and overall (P=0.08) survival. In multivariate analysis, tumour thickness was the strongest prognostic factor for disease-free survival (P<0.01). High p53 expression indicated a poorer prognosis (P=0.05). In metastatic melanoma, the expression levels of Bcl-2 and p53 were lower than those in their primary counterparts (P=0.08 for each). Ki-67 expression showed no remarkable changes. It can be concluded that high p53 expression in tumour cells is associated with a poorer prognosis in primary melanoma, and high Bcl-2 expression in tumour cells is an adverse prognostic marker in intermediate-thickness primary melanoma.",

Tumor suppressor p53-mediated apoptosis is essential for the response to radio- and chemotherapy. Although p53 is not frequently mutated in melanoma, it is inactivated by integrin αv-mediated signaling, as we previously demonstrated 1, which may account, at least partially, for increased apoptosis resistance of malignant melanoma. In this study we addressed the question whether functional restoration of p53 by APR-246 (PRIMA-1Met), which can reactivate mutant p53 and induce massive apoptosis in cancer cells, is able to restore the function of inactive p53 in melanoma. Using a three-dimensional collagen gel (3D-collagen) to culture melanoma cells carrying wild-type p53, we found that APR-246 treatment resulted in activation of p53, leading to increased expression of p53 pro-apoptotic targets Apaf1 and PUMA and activation of caspase- 9 and -3. Moreover, APR-246 triggered melanoma cell apoptosis that was mediated by p53 and caspase 9. Importantly, APR-246 treatment also suppressed human melanoma xenograft tumors in vivo in a p53-dependent manner. Thus, wild-type p53 reactivation may provide a novel approach for malignant melanoma treatment, with APR-246 as a candidate drug for such a development.",

Levels of tumor suppressor protein p53 are very low in cells due to its rapid turnover by UPP-mediated degradation. While p53 is mutated in human cancers, most human melanomas maintain wild-type conformation. In this study, to investigate the effects of UPP inhibitor invitro and in vivo, we used a genetically-engineered mouse model (GEMM) that has the same genetic alterations as those of human melanomas. Melanoma cells were established from mouse tumors and named 8B20 cells. Treatment of 8B20 cells with the UPP inhibitors, MG132 and clasto-lactacystin-β-lactone, led to an increase in levels of p53 while treatment with non-proteasomal inhibitors did not alter p53 levels. UPP inhibitors induced formation of heavy molecular weight ubiquitinated proteins, a hallmark of UPP inhibition, and p53-specific poly-ubiquitinated products in 8B20 cells. To further decipher the mechanism of p53 stabilization, we investigated half-life of p53 in cells treated with cycloheximide to block de novo protein synthesis. Treatment of 8B20 cells with MG132 led to an increase in the half-life of p53. Further analysis revealed that p53 stabilization was not mediated by phosphorylation of Ser-15 and Ser-20 residues. In vivo studies showed that MG132 induced p53 overexpression and reduced tumor growth, suggesting an important role of p53 stabilization in controlling melanoma. Taken together, our studies provide a proof of principle for using a GEMM to address the mechanisms of action and efficacy of melanoma treatment.",

Cultured primary uveal melanoma cells (MM28, MM50, Mel202, Mel270, and Mel290), MCF7 breast carcinoma cells, normal uveal melanocytes (UM47), and normal human diploid fibroblasts (NHDFs) were irradiated at 250 kVp and 12 mA at a dose rate of 1.08 Gy/min for a total dose of up to 20 Gy. Cell viability was analyzed with trypan blue exclusion. Western blot analysis was used to analyze the expression of p53, p53-phospho-Ser15, p21, Bax, PUMA, and Bcl-x(L).;No p53 gene mutations were found in MM28, MM50, or Mel270 cells. Upstream signaling to p53 was intact, with normal induction of p53 and phosphorylation of p53-Ser15, in all five cell lines.

MM28, MM50, and Mel202 cells failed to deamidate Bcl-x(L) in response to radiation-induced DNA damage. Overall, four of the five uveal melanoma cell lines exhibited at least one downstream defect in the p53 pathway.;Expression of p53 and upstream signaling to p53 in response to radiation-induced DNA damage appear to be intact in most uveal melanomas. In contrast, functional defects in the p53 pathway downstream of p53 activation appear to be common.

In melanoma, p53 predominantly remains wild type, thus its role has been neglected. To study the effect of p53 on melanocyte function and melanomagenesis, we crossed the ‘high-p53’Mdm4+/− mouse to the well-established TP-ras0/+ murine melanoma progression model. After treatment with the carcinogen dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA), TP-ras0/+ mice on the Mdm4+/− background developed fewer tumors with a delay in the age of onset of melanomas compared to TP-ras0/+ mice. Furthermore, we observed a dramatic decrease in tumor growth, lack of metastasis with increased survival of TP-ras0/+: Mdm4+/− mice. Thus, p53 effectively prevented the conversion of small benign tumors to malignant and metastatic melanoma. p53 activation in cultured primary melanocyte and melanoma cell lines using Nutlin-3, a specific Mdm2 antagonist, supported these findings. Moreover, global gene expression and network analysis of Nutlin-3-treated primary human melanocytes indicated that cell cycle regulation through the p21WAF1/CIP1 signaling network may be the key anti-melanomagenic activity of p53.",

We present a multi-institutional study to discover new molecular risk factors associated with SLN positivity in thin and intermediate-thickness melanoma.;Gene clusters with functional roles in melanoma metastasis were discovered by next-generation sequencing and validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction using a discovery set of 73 benign nevi, 76 primary cutaneous melanoma, and 11 in-transit melanoma metastases. We then used polymerase chain reaction to quantify gene expression in a model development cohort of 360 consecutive thin and intermediate-thickness melanomas and a validation cohort of 146 melanomas. Outcome of interest was SLN biopsy metastasis within 90 days of melanoma diagnosis. Logic and logistic regression analyses were used to develop a model for the likelihood of SLN metastasis from molecular, clinical, and histologic variables.;ITGB3, LAMB1, PLAT, and TP53 expression were associated with SLN metastasis. The predictive ability of a model that included these molecular variables in combination with clinicopathologic variables (patient age, Breslow depth, and tumor ulceration) was significantly greater than a model that only considered clinicopathologic variables and also performed well in the validation cohort (area under the curve, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.97; false-positive and false-negative rates of 22% and 0%, respectively, using a 10% cutoff for predicted SLN metastasis risk).;The addition of cell adhesion-linked gene expression variables to clinicopathologic variables improves the identification of patients with SLN metastases within 90 days of melanoma diagnosis.",

Here, we report that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces senescence and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) expression that is related to MITF. We found that MITF could bind TP53 to regulate CDKN1A. Furthermore, the interaction between MITF and TP53 is dependent on AKT activity. We found that AKT phosphorylates MITF at S510. Phosphorylated MITF S510 enhances its affinity to TP53 and promotes CDKN1A expression. Meanwhile, the unphosphorylative MITF promotes TYR expression. The levels of p-MITF-S510 are low in 90% human melanoma samples. Thus the level of p-MITF-S510 could be a possible diagnostic marker for melanoma. Our findings reveal a mechanism for regulating MITF functions in response to EGF stimulation and suggest a possible implementation for preventing the over proliferation of melanoma cells.",

To study the role of NRAS in zebrafish, a transgenic approach was applied to generate fish that express human oncogenic NRAS(Q61K) under the control of the melanocyte-restricted mitfa promoter. By screening the progeny of the injected animals, two strains stably expressing the NRAS transgene were identified: Tg(mitfa:EGFP:NRAS(Q61K))(1) and Tg(mitfa:EGFP:NRAS(Q61K))(2). Stable expression of this transgene results in hyperpigmented fish displaying a complete ablation of the normal pigment pattern. Although oncogenic NRAS expression alone was found to be insufficient to promote tumor formation, loss of functional p53 was found to collaborate with NRAS expression in the genesis of melanoma. The tumors derived from these animals are variably pigmented and closely resemble human melanoma. Underscoring the pathological similarities between these tumors and human disease and suggesting that common pathways are similar in these models and human disease, gene set enrichment analysis performed on microarray data found that the upregulated genes from zebrafish melanomas are highly enriched in human tumor samples.

But in the setting of melanoma, a highly aggressive and invariably fatal malignancy in its advanced disseminated form, mutation/deletion of p53 is relatively rare, whereas its positive regulator ARF is often lost. Here, we show that genetic deficiency in Arf but not p53 facilitates rapid development of melanoma in a genetically engineered mouse model. This difference is accounted for, at least in part, by the unanticipated observation that, unlike fibroblasts, senescence control in melanocytes is strongly regulated by Arf and not p53. Moreover, oncogenic NRAS collaborates with deficiency in Arf, but not p53, to fully transform melanocytes. Our data demonstrate that ARF and p53, although linked in a common pathway, suppress tumorigenesis through distinct, lineage-dependent mechanisms and suggest that ARF helps restrict melanoma progression by executing the oncogene-induced senescence program in benign nevi. Thus, therapeutics designed to restore wild-type p53 function may be insufficient to counter melanoma and other malignancies in which ARF holds p53-independent tumor suppressor activity.",

Further markers on chromosomes 3 and 9 were analyzed individually.;Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was identified in 63% of tumors, most frequently on chromosome 3 (52%), in association with epithelioid cells (P = 0.0002) and microvascular loops (P = 0.0008). In the majority of cases, LOH on chromosome 3 was detected at all informative markers. The second most common alteration was LOH at an RB1 intragenic marker (21% tumors), with retention of a more centromeric 13q marker (near BRCA2). The pattern of LOH on chromosome 9p was consistent with the involvement of a region telomeric to CDKN2A. LOH at TP53 was infrequent.;In the majority of cases, chromosome 3 LOH involves an entire chromosome homologue, which hampers identification of the relevant suppressor loci. This LOH correlates with the presence of microvascular loops and epithelioid cells, two of the recognized histologic indicators of poor prognosis.

The mutations were not significantly associated with p53 staining results, and p53 alterations (mutations or marked immunopositivity) had no prognostic value.

By using recombinant adenoviruses that express p53 or p53-related p51A or p73beta, we tested their apoptotic activities in melanoma cells. Yeast functional assay revealed a mutation of p53 at the 258th codon (AAA [K] instead of GAA [E]) in one cell line, 70W, out of six human melanoma cell lines analyzed (SK-mel-23, SK-mel-24, SK-mel-118, TXM18, 70W, and G361). Adenovirus-mediated transfer of p53, p51A, and/or p73beta suppressed growth and induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation of SK-mel-23, SK-mel-118, and 70W cells. Interestingly, p51A induced DNA fragmentation in them more significantly than p53 and p73beta. By Western blotting we analyzed levels of apoptosis-related proteins in cells expressing p53 family members. Apoptotic Bax and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 were not significantly upregulated or downregulated by expression of p53, p51A, or p73beta, except for p53-expressing 70W cells, which contained a larger amount of Bax protein than LacZ-expressing cells. Activation of caspase-3 was demonstrated only in p51A-expressing SK-mel-118 cells. We show here that p51A can mediate apoptosis in both wild-type and mutant p53-expressing melanoma cells more significantly than p53 and p73beta. It is also suggested that in melanoma cells (i) cellular target protein(s) other than Bcl-2 and Bax might be responsible for induction of p51A-mediated apoptosis and (ii) caspase-3 is not always involved in the apoptosis by p53 family members.",

In contrast to p53, many studies on cancer patients failed to detect mutational inactivation of p73 and reported overexpression of wild-type p73 instead. A possible explanation was provided by the recent discovery of N-terminal truncated isoforms of p73 (DeltaTA-p73) that act as dominant-negative inhibitors of wild-type p53 and TA-p73 and result in tumor growth in nude mice. We investigated the role of DeltaTA-p73 in the development and progression of human melanomas, which lack p53 mutations. We analyzed 8 benign melanocytic nevi, 8 primary melanomas and 19 melanoma metastases for alterations of TA-p73 and DeltaTA-p73 expression using isoform-specific real-time RT-PCR. Based on our results, p73Deltaex2 and Deltaex2/3 spliced transcripts derived from the first promoter were significantly up-regulated in melanoma metastases, whereas DeltaN-p73 generated from the second promoter was the predominant isoform in benign nevi. Moreover, increased expression of p73Deltaex2 and p73Deltaex2/3 correlated with high-levels of both TA-p73 and E2F1.

We also used quantitative PCR to quantitatively assess the expression of NRAS among normal cells, including fibroblast and melanocytes, as well as melanoma cells from our patient. Full autopsy documented tumors in the brain, spinal cord, lung, liver, testis, bone marrow, and, retrospectively, in the placenta. Next-generation sequencing and chromosome microarray in our patient revealed novel findings, including duplication of a mutated NRAS gene, leading to an aggressive clinical course and disseminated disease. Quantitative PCR showed a five-fold increase in NRAS expression in the melanoma cell line when compared with normal melanocytes. Finally, three amino acid-changing germline variants were detected: homozygous TP53 p.P72R, heterozygous KIT p.M541L, and homozygous KDR (VEGFR2) p.Q472H. These genes are involved in malignancy and other potentially relevant pathways, such as mast cell and melanocytic signaling, as well as angiogenesis.

Transcriptional activation of WAF1 can be accomplished by increasing levels of p53 protein induced by various cellular stresses, including DNA damage. Metastatic melanomas are paradoxical in that most overexpress wild-type p53 protein, yet cell growth is not inhibited. Thus, it is possible that lack of growth suppression in melanomas is due, in part, to mutations in the WAF1 gene. Therefore, we examined the entire coding region of the WAF1 gene in 24 metastatic melanoma cell lines and three normal melanocyte lines by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and direct DNA sequencing. We similarly examined the DNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines, derived from nine individuals belonging to seven melanoma-prone families, in which haplotypes of markers on 6p cosegregate with melanoma for germline mutations in the WAF1 gene. Results indicate that (i) mutation of the WAF1 gene is an infrequent event in individuals with sporadic melanoma or predisposed to familial melanoma and (ii) the uncontrolled growth of melanoma cells is not due to mutation of the WAF1 gene. However, expression studies found a wide variation in the level of p21 protein in melanoma cells, suggesting that aberrant regulation of p21 may play a role in melanoma development. Moreover, there was no predictable relationship between p21 expression and p53 expression, indicating that other, p53-independent, pathways may be important for the regulation of p21 in melanoma cells.",

These tumors do not have mutations in the p19(ARF)/p53 pathway, suggesting a specific involvement of the p16(INK4a)/Cdk4/Rb pathway in melanoma development. Moreover, by using targeted mice deficient for other INK4 inhibitors, we show that deletion of p18(INK4c) but not of p15(INK4b) confers proliferative advantage to melanocytic tumor growth.

We reported that an adenoviral vector containing wt p53 significantly reduced [(3)H]thymidine uptake in melanoma cells containing mutant but not wt p53. Subsequently we showed that CD1 decreased melanoma proliferation and increased apoptosis. We now extend these findings by evaluating the effect on preformed melanomas of (1) intratumoral therapy with wt p53 alone, (2) wt p53 in combination with antisense (AS) CD1, both short (< or =14 days) and longer term, and (3) doubling the dose or repeat doses of wt p53 or AS CD1. Two melanoma cells lines that metastasize in SCID mice (451 and 1205) were used, one containing a p53 mutation (451) and the other a normal p53 gene sequence (1205). Compared to injection with a control adenoviral vector containing beta-galactosidase (LacZ), intratumoral injection of wt p53 slowed the growth of tumors formed from 451 cells. Using 5 x 10(8) plaque forming units as our standard intratumoral dose, neither doubling the dose of LacZ, p53 or AS CD1, nor repeat doses of the vectors, was as effective as combined therapy with wt p53+AS CD1, which resulted in the shrinkage of all tumors treated and 4/7 (57%) tumors vanished. No tumors treated with wt p53 or AS CD1 alone vanished. Wt p53+AS CD1 treatment resulted in significantly more cells undergoing apoptosis compared to either therapy alone.

Moreover, The degree of KHm5 and 6 cell growth inhibition was greater in the presence of both p53R2-targeting siRNA and nimustine (ACNU) than with ACNU alone, suggesting that p53R2 silencing enhanced the chemosensitivity of KHm5 and 6 cells to ACNU.;We propose p53R2 as a therapeutic target to enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy in patients with p53R2-positive melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and melanoma are the rare progeny of precancerous lesions that usually remain stable or regress. For SCC the sequence appears to include TP53 mutant clones in normal skin; dysplasia; carcinoma in situ; and SCC. When such lesions are contiguous, their TP53 mutations are consistent with a single clonal lineage. The set of TP53 mutations in tumours is more restricted than in precancers, suggesting additional selection. Melanoma lies at the end of a continuum including mole, dysplastic naevus, radial growth melanoma and vertical growth. The genetics of melanoma is less clear. Basal cell carcinomas seem to arise without a precancer and contain mutations in TP53 and PTCH. Childhood sunlight exposure directs the location and frequency of precancers. For melanoma, its effects on intermittently exposed body sites are superimposed on the effect at sites chronically exposed. SCC precancers and tumours, BCC tumours and melanoma cell lines contain UV induced mutations. Sun exposed skin of normal individuals contains thousands of small clones of TP53 mutated cells. Predisposition to sunlight induced precancer is a multigenic trait involving factors such as hair and skin color, DNA repair proficiency and mole type and number. These each contribute a relative risk on the order of two to four. Familial predisposition to dysplastic naevi carries a larger risk. The cell of origin for melanoma is uncontroversial, and the proposed hair follicle origin of BCC is consistent with the presence of stem cells in the bulge region. The origin of SCCs and the arrangement of interfollicular stem cell compartments are less clear. Clonal expansion of the initial mutated cell may also be driven by sunlight. When a mutation confers apoptosis resistance, as TP53 mutations do, subsequent UV exposure will be more likely to kill normal cells than mutants. The latter can expand into a clone, only one cell of which need be mutated again. Immunosuppressant drugs may have the same effect as UV, facilitating the clonal expansion of precancers. In the absence of exogenous influences, mutant clones and precancers tend to regress. There is little evidence that regression of precancers is immunological, though regression of melanoma appears to be. The chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU causes regression of dysplasias by removing initiated cells, perhaps by enhancing apoptosis. In contrast, retinoic acid temporarily suppresses clonal expansion. Most sunscreens are mutagenic, with as yet unknown consequences. Mice develop dysplasias and SCCs after UV irradiation. Initiation and clonal expansion of dysplasias is UV driven, but conversion to SCC and subsequent growth involve spontaneous events. With chemical carcinogens mice develop papillomas that usually regress and thus are precancers. Tumour promotion yields abundant low risk papillomas that contain Hras1 mutations but rarely progress to SCC. High risk papillomas are infrequent but do convert to SCC, particularly if re-treated with mutagens. Conversion to SCC is associated with TP53 mutations. The mechanisms of multiple mutation and clonal expansion observed in human and mouse systems, respectively, are beginning to converge into a coherent understanding of precancerous events in skin.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Familial melanoma accounts for approximately a tenth of all melanoma cases. The most commonly known melanoma susceptibility gene is the highly penetrant CDKN2A (p16INK4a) locus, which is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion and accounts for approximately 20-50 % of familial melanoma cases. Mutated p16INK4a shows impaired capacity to inhibit the cyclin D1-CDK4 complex, allowing for unchecked cell cycle progression. Mutations in the second protein coded by CDKN2A, p14ARF, are much less common and result in proteasomal degradation of p53 with subsequent accumulation of DNA damage as the cell progresses through the cell cycle without a functional p53-mediated DNA damage response. Mutations in CDK4 that impair the inhibitory interaction with p16INK4a also increase melanoma risk but these mutations are extremely rare. Genes of the melanin biosynthetic pathway, including MC1R and MITF, have also been implicated in melanomagenesis. MC1R variants were traditionally thought to increase risk for melanoma secondary to intensified UV-mediated DNA damage in the setting of absent photoprotective eumelanin. Accumulation of pheomelanin, which appears to have a carcinogenic effect regardless of UV exposure, may be a more likely mechanism. Impaired SUMOylation of the E318K variant of MITF results in increased transcription of genes that confer melanocytes with a pro-malignant phenotype. Mutations in the tumor suppressor BAP1 enhance the metastatic potential of uveal melanoma and predispose to cutaneous/ocular melanoma, atypical melanocytic tumors, and other internal malignancies (COMMON syndrome). Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous low-risk alleles. Although several melanoma susceptibility genes have been identified, risk assessment tools have been developed only for the most common gene implicated with hereditary melanoma, CDKN2A. MelaPRO, a validated model that relies on Mendelian inheritance and Bayesian probability theories, estimates carrier probability for CDKN2A and future risk of melanoma taking into account a patient's family and past medical history of melanoma. Genetic testing for CDKN2A mutations is currently available but the Melanoma Genetics Consortium recommends offering such testing to patients only in the context of research protocols because clinical utility is uncertain.",

Using subtraction hybridization, cDNAs were identified that display enhanced expression in terminally differentiated and growth arrested human melanoma cells (Jiang and Fisher, 1993; Jiang et al., 1994a). A specific melanoma differentiation-associated (mda) cDNA, mda-6, is described whose expression inversely correlates with melanoma progression and growth. mda-6 is identical to WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 that encodes the M(r) 21,000 protein (p21) that is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Actively growing normal melanocyte, SV40-immortalized human melanocyte and dysplastic nevus cell lines synthesize elevated levels of mda-6 mRNA; whereas, actively proliferating radial and early vertical growth phase primary melanomas as well as metastatic human melanoma cells produce reduced levels of mda-6 mRNA. Treatment of primary and metastatic human melanoma cells with IFN-beta + MEZ results in growth inhibition and an increase in mda-6 expression. mda-6 expression also increases when human melanoma cells are grown to high saturation densities or when grown in serum-free medium. Using anti-p53 and anti-p21 antibodies, an inverse correlation is found between p53 and p21 protein levels during growth arrest and differentiation. Induction of growth arrest and terminal differentiation in H0-1 human melanoma cells by IFN-beta + MEZ results in a temporal decrease in wild-type p53 protein levels with a corresponding increase in p21 levels. In the Matrigel-assisted melanoma progression model, mda-6 expression decreases in early vertical growth phase primary human melanoma cells selected for autonomous or enhanced tumor formation in nude mice. In metastatic human melanoma cells displaying a loss of metastatic potential resulting from introduction of a normal human chromosome 6, mda-6 mRNA levels increase.

We performed comprehensive targeted exon sequencing analysis of 467 cancer-related genes in a larger series of 15 anorectal melanomas, focusing on potentially actionable variants based on gain- and loss-of-function mutations. We report the identification of oncogenic driver events in the majority (93%) of anorectal melanomas. These included variants in canonical MAPK pathway effectors rarely observed in cutaneous melanomas (including an HRAS mutation, as well as a BRAF mutation resulting in duplication of threonine 599), and recurrent mutations in the tumor suppressor NF1 in 20% of cases, which represented the second-most frequently mutated gene after KIT in our series. Furthermore, we identify SF3B1 mutations as a recurrent genetic event in mucosal melanomas.

Although melanoma cells often retain wild-type p53 tumour suppressor protein and express it at high levels, the p53 mediated apoptosis pathway is suppressed.

We have studied the cellular effects of trichostatin A (TSA), a HDAC inhibitor, in a panel of melanoma cell lines and its mechanism of action in relation to p53. TSA stabilized wild-type p53, but p53 protein accumulation was overridden by simultaneous downregulation of p53 mRNA leading to a decrease in p53 protein. While growth arrest was induced in all cell lines studied and apoptosis in most (6/7), these cellular effects were independent of the p53 status of the cells. Inhibiting p53 function by a dominant negative p53 (p53(175His)) confirmed that the HDAC inhibitor induced apoptosis was independent of wild-type p53, even though TSA slightly activated p53 in a reporter assay.

A novel gain at 14q23.2-31.1 was revealed by alignment of whole genome profiles of parental cell line and irinotecan-resistant clones. Further analysis of this amplicon indicates that it encompassed genes involved in DNA repair (RAD51L, MLH3), reactive oxygen species (GPX2, CSTZ1, NGB, RDH11, ZADH1), and transportome (ABCD4, ATP6V1D, SLC10A6).

We therefore hypothesized that nitric oxide antagonizes chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Whether nitric oxide is capable of regulating cell growth and apoptotic responses to cisplatin treatment in melanoma cell lines was evaluated. We demonstrate herein that depletion of endogenously produced nitric oxide can inhibit melanoma proliferation and promote apoptosis. Moreover, our data indicate that the depletion of nitric oxide leads to changes in cell cycle regulation and enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells.

Furthermore, dominant negative inhibition of p53 activity enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis.

Interestingly, melanoma tumour sequencing has revealed an overrepresentation of mutations signature of unrepaired UV-induced DNA damage. Repair of UVA-induced DNA damage is thought to occur primarily through the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) pathway, which recognises and repairs damage either coupled to transcription (Transcription Coupled Repair; TCR), or through global genome scanning (Global Genome Repair; GGR). Current literature suggests NER is deficient in melanoma, however the cause of this remains unknown; and whether reduced NER activity in response to UVA may be involved in melanoma development remains uncharacterised. In this study we aimed to determine if melanoma cells exhibit reduced levels of NER activity in response to UVA.;Melanocyte and melanoma cell lines were UVA-irradiated, and DNA damage levels assessed by immunodetection of Cyclobutane Pyrimidine Dimer (CPD) and (6-4) Photoproduct [(6-4)PP] lesions. Expression of NER pathway components and p53 following UVA treatment was quantified by qPCR and western blot.;UVA did not induce detectable induction of (6-4)PP lesions, consistent with previous studies. Repair of CPDs induced by UVA was initiated at 4 h and complete within 48 h in normal melanocytes, whereas repair initiation was delayed to 24 h and >40 % of lesions remained in melanoma cell lines at 48 h. This was coupled with a delayed and reduced induction of GGR component XPC in melanoma cells, independent of p53.;These findings support that NER activity is reduced in melanoma cells due to deficient GGR. Further investigation into the role of NER in UVA-induced melanomagenesis is warranted and may have implications for melanoma treatment.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Mutations in the mismatch DNA repair gene human MutS homologen 2 (hMSH2) are causative for microsatellite instability and carcinogenesis in various human tumours, including hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. Because microsatellite instability has been detected in malignant melanoma, we have investigated hMSH2 in melanocytic tumours. We found strong nuclear immunoreactivity for hMSH2 that was elevated in malignant melanoma and melanoma metastases as compared to acquired nevi. These findings suggest that increased genomic instability in malignant melanoma is associated with elevated protein levels of this DNA repair enzyme. hMSH2 is not exclusively regulated by proliferative activity in melanocytes, because there was no correlation between staining patterns of hMSH2 and the proliferation marker Ki-67. In contrast, immunoreactivity scores for hMSH2 and p53 were both upregulated in malignant melanocytic tumours. These findings support the concept that hMSH2 gene expression may be regulated in melanocytes by the p53 protein, as has been reported previously in other tissues. Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we detected strong hMSH2 mRNA expression in each of 8 melanoma cell lines analysed (highest amounts in SK-MEL-25 cells, lowest amounts in MML-I cells). In conclusion, our findings indicate that hMSH-2 may be of importance for genetic stability, tumorigenesis and progression of malignant melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The search for candidate genes involved in the genesis of common cancers has traditionally been hampered by ambiguities in the process of determining by reliable, clinical criteria which persons harbor the genetic lesion that confers malignant susceptibility. In the case of cutaneous melanoma, the existence of genetic susceptibility has long been evident from its tendency to cluster in families, but it has been unclear until recently whether the genetic basis of familial melanoma derives from the concerted interaction of multiple genes or from a major locus with properties of a tumor suppressor gene. The original strategy used to circumvent difficulties in identifying those who harbor the genetic defect exploited a proposed melanoma precursor lesion, the dysplastic nevus, as the phenotypic marker from which the presence of the melanoma-associated genotype was inferred. That strategy in genetic linkage studies provided the first indication of a major gene for melanoma and assigned the locus to the short arm of chromosome 1. In part because the criteria for the dysplastic nevus have been neither well-defined nor generally agreed upon, multiple independent attempts to confirm the assignment of a gene to that location have failed. The probable map position of a major gene became clear when the most frequently deleted region of the human genome in melanoma tumors was localized to chromosome 9p. The significance of this assignment was established when genetic linkage studies of multiple melanoma kindreds subsequently evaluated the correlated inheritance between melanoma gene carriers, as assigned by a history of melanoma, and molecular markers for DNA polymorphisms near the 9p candidate region; this analysis provided strong statistical evidence of linkage to a melanoma susceptibility locus. Once this candidate tumor suppressor gene) as well as other relevant suppressor loci that may exist is actually cloned and characterized, rapid advances can be expected in our understanding of the pathophysiologic basis for development of melanoma. This will provide opportunities for exploring the mechanisms underlying defects in the gene and the molecular consequences of its loss of function. It will then be possible to identify precisely those persons with a genetic risk for melanoma; as a result, surveillance efforts can be more appropriately focused than has heretofore been possible.",

We have analyzed two different groups of XP: the XP complementation group C (XP-C), deficient in global nucleotide excision repair but proficient in transcription-coupled repair and associated with a very early onset of skin cancers; and the XP variant (XPV), deficient in the bypass of DNA photoproducts. To get new insights into the biology of melanoma in XP patients, we studied 20 melanomas from four XP-C and two XPV patients in terms of pathology, immunohistochemistry of p53, mutations in exons 4-9 of the p53 gene, and polymorphisms of the p53 gene at codon 72. All statistical tests were two-sided. The majority of the XP melanomas were of the lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) type, as found in the elderly. p53 point mutations were found in 60% of XP-C melanomas and in only 10% of XPV melanomas, this latter frequency being similar to what has been reported in the general population. Mutations show the specific UV-signature because the majority were CC to tandem and C to T transitions located at the bipyrimidine sites known to be hotspots of UV-induced DNA lesions. All DNA lesions giving rise to mutations in XP-C melanomas were located on the nontranscribed strand of the p53 gene, demonstrating that these patients' cells were able to carry out preferential repair in vivo. The LMMs found in XP-C are associated with an accumulation of unrepaired DNA lesions and may represent a good model for the LMM induction in the elderly.",

Because even melanomas harboring wild-type (wt) p53 show an abnormal response to radiation and p53 mutations occur late during melanoma progression, we investigated whether the effect of the bcl-2/bcl-xL bispecific antisense oligonucleotide 4625 is dependent on the p53 status in human C8161 melanoma cells. Upon treatment with oligonucleotide 4625, p53-mut C8161 cells showed earlier DNA damage, which occurred concomitantly with the reduction of bcl-2 and bcl-xL expression and the increase in the expression of proapoptotic bax. Loss of cell viability, bcl-2 down-regulation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, indicative of apoptosis, also occurred in wt p53 C8161 cells on treatment with oligonucleotide 4625. These effects, however, were mediated by strong induction of p53 without changes in p21 WAF1 expression in wt p53 cells, whereas a 70% decrease in p21 WAF1 expression was observed in mut p53 cells. In contrast to many other anticancer agents to which the apoptotic response is decreased because of p53 mutations, our data suggest that the bcl-2/bcl-xL bispecific antisense oligonucleotide 4625 effectively induces p53-independent apoptosis in human C8161 melanoma cells.",

We analysed the functionality of the p53-signaling pathway in a panel of seven human melanoma cell lines consisting of one p53-deficient line, two lines with mutant p53, and four lines expressing wild-type p53. Only lines with wild-type p53 were characterized by elevated levels of endogenous p21, high activity of p53-responsive reporters and accumulation of p53 in response to genotoxic stress, common properties of functional p53. The presence of wild-type p53 was associated with depletion or loss of p14ARF and p16 expression. The levels of p33ING1b and p24ING1c, two major products of Ing1 locus and putative coregulators of p53, were elevated in all cell lines tested; however, ectopic expression of either ING1 isoform had no effect on cell proliferation. All lines retained expression of Apaf-1, and all but one remained sensitive to ectopic expression of retrovirus-transduced p53. Our data indicate that regardless of abnormally high levels of p53 in melanomas, their p53 remains competent in transactivation of its targets, and, if highly overexpressed, capable of growth inhibition.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cellular adhesion molecules of the cadherin, integrin, and immunoglobulin superfamilies are important to both growth and metastasis of many cancers, including malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma is an excellent model for studying these molecules, due in part to a sequential series of five defineable stages. As the malignant phenotype of melanoma cells changes from the noninvasive radial growth phase to the vertical growth phase, which has high metastatic potential, so does the repertoire of the cellular adhesion molecules expressed on the cells surface. The cellular adhesion molecule MCAM/MUC18 confers metastatic potential and increased tumorigenicity to melanoma cells. MCAM/MUC18 mediates homotypic and heterotypic adhesion between melanoma cells and endothelial cells, respectively. Both types of interaction may promote metastasis at different stages in the metastasis cascade. We developed a fully humanized antibody to MCAM/MUC18 (ABX-MA1) that blocked melanoma metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, ABX-MA1 blocked the homotypic interaction between melanoma cells and endothelial cells as well as the promoter and collagenase activity of MMP-2. During melanoma progression the loss of E-cadherin expression disrupts normal homeostasis in the skin by freeing melanoma cells from structural and functional regulation by keratinocytes. The loss of functional E-cadherin is parallelled by a gain in N-cadherin function that mediates homotypic interaction between melanoma cells, facilitates gap-junctional formation with fibroblasts and endothelial cells and promotes melanoma cell migration and survival. In addition, loss of E-cadherin may affect the beta-catenin/wnt signaling pathways, resulting in deregulation of genes involved in growth and metastasis. The integrin family member alpha(v)beta(3) is widely expressed on melanoma cells in the vertical growth phase. When alpha(v)beta(3) is expressed in melanoma cells in the radial growth phase, this integrin is associated with increased tumor growth in vivo. alpha(v)beta(3) may also promote melanoma invasion, through an interaction with MMP-2, and transendothelial migration, via a heterotypic melanomaendothelial cell interaction.

Some of these functions, such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, have been shown to be dependent on the activity of both ING1 and p53 proteins. Two recent reports by Scott and colleagues demonstrate that p33(ING1) (one of the ING1 isoforms) translocates to the nucleus and binds to PCNA upon UV irradiation. Here we report that p33(ING1) mediates UV-induced cell death in melanoma cells. We found that overexpression of p33(ING1) increased while the introduction of an antisense p33(ING1) plasmid reduced the apoptosis rate in melanoma cells after UVB irradiation. We also demonstrated that enhancement of UV-induced apoptosis by p33(ING1) required the presence of p53. Moreover, we found that p33(ING1) enhanced the expression of endogenous Bax and altered the mitochondrial membrane potential. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that p33(ING1) cooperates with p53 in UVB-induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial cell death pathway in melanoma cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Once melanoma metastasizes, no effective treatment modalities prolong survival in most patients. This notorious refractoriness to therapy challenges investigators to identify agents that overcome melanoma resistance to apoptosis. Whereas many survival pathways contribute to the death-defying phenotype in melanoma, a defect in apoptotic machinery previously highlighted inactivation of Apaf-1, an apoptosome component engaged after mitochondrial damage. During studies involving Notch signaling in melanoma, we observed a gamma-secretase tripeptide inhibitor (GSI; z-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO), selected from a group of compounds originally used in Alzheimer's disease, induced apoptosis in nine of nine melanoma lines. GSI only induced G2-M growth arrest (but not killing) in five of five normal melanocyte cultures tested. Effective killing of melanoma cells by GSI involved new protein synthesis and a mitochondrial-based pathway mediated by up-regulation of BH3-only members (Bim and NOXA). p53 activation was not necessary for up-regulation of NOXA in melanoma cells. Blocking GSI-induced NOXA using an antisense (but not control) oligonucleotide significantly reduced the apoptotic response. GSI also killed melanoma cell lines with low Apaf-1 levels. We conclude that GSI is highly effective in killing melanoma cells while sparing normal melanocytes. Direct enhancement of BH3-only proteins executes an apoptotic program overcoming resistance of this lethal tumor. Identification of a p53-independent apoptotic pathway in melanoma cells, including cells with low Apaf-1, bypasses an impediment to current cytotoxic therapy and provides new targets for future therapeutic trials involving chemoresistant tumors.",

The cellular resistance mechanisms involved in melanoma chemoresistance have not yet been elucidated. Melanoma-derived cell lines are often markedly chemoresistant. Using the in vitro soft agar culture system to predict tumour cell sensitivity in well-established human melanoma cell lines, a high degree of resistance against all the cytostatic agents studied has been reported, suggesting the presence of intrinsic cellular resistance mechanisms. The relevance of the well-defined resistance mechanisms mediated by P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), the glutathione/glutathione S-transferase system and topoisomerase II enzyme are reviewed. Mutated N-Ras oncogene has recently been implicated in melanoma resistance to cisplatin, both in vitro and in vivo, and the role of two other oncogenes, Bcl-2 and p53, which are already involved in the chemoresistance of haematological and solid malignancies, is beginning to be better elucidated. The finding that many chemotherapeutic agents can kill susceptible cells through the apoptosis pathway provides new molecular insight into chemoresistance mechanisms and suggests that apoptosis and/or resistance to apoptosis of melanoma cells should be investigated to better clarify the mechanism of melanoma chemoresistance.",

To investigate whether sun exposure also affects p53 in melanoma, we analysed 81 melanoma specimens for mutations in the p53 gene. The mutation frequency is higher than thus far reported: 17 specimens (21%) harbour one or more p53 mutations. Strikingly, 17 out of 22 mutations in p53 are of the C:G to TA or CC:GG to TT:AA transitional type, strongly suggesting an aetiology involving UV exposure. Interestingly, the p53 mutation frequency in metastases was much lower than in primary tumours. In the case of metastases, a role for sun exposure was indicated by the finding that the mutations are present exclusively in skin metastases and not in internal metastases. Together with a relatively frequent occurrence of silent third-base pair mutations in primary melanomas, this indicates that the p53 mutations, at least in these tumours, have not contributed to melanomagenesis and may have originated after establishment of the primary tumour.",

The mechanisms underlying this resistance are not well-understood. One factor that is reported to be involved in melanoma cell survival is PAX3, a transcription factor normally expressed during embryonic development, and which is critically required for development of neural crest-derivatives, including skin melanocytes. PAX3 expression is deregulated in primary melanomas and most melanoma cell lines. Here we have investigated whether targeting PAX3 expression in melanoma cell lines together with chemotherapeutic treatment increases susceptibility to therapeutic cell death. Using PAX3-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (PAX3-AS) to treat melanoma cell lines in vitro, we showed dose-dependent reduction of proliferation of melanoma cells, and induction of apoptosis compared with control treatments. Induction of apoptosis was accompanied by the induction of active caspase-3 in UACC62 and M14 cells, and p53 protein in UACC62 cells. Treatment of melanoma cells with cisplatin induces DNA damage and cytotoxicity, which is thought to be via p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Treatment of either p53 mutant (M14) or wild-type (UACC62) melanoma cells with cisplatin, and varying doses of PAX3-AS, resulted in percentages of cells undergoing apoptosis equivalent to the sum of the individual treatments, irrespective of mutation status [e.g., UACC62, 43.8% (1 micromol/L PAX3-AS), 30.1% (20 micromol/L cisplatin), 69.6% (PAX3-AS + cisplatin); M14, 12.6% (1 micromol/L PAX3-AS), 41.5% (40 micromol/L cisplatin), 50.2% (PAX3-AS + cisplatin)].

A patient with multiple neurofibromas was referred with a provisional diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Prior molecular testing, though, had failed to identify an NF1 mutation by sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. His family history was significant for multiple in situ/malignant melanomas at young ages and several different cancers reminiscent of an underlying syndrome. A search of the Familial Cancer Database, FaCD Online, highlighted several families with cutaneous melanoma and nervous system tumours who were subsequently identified to have large deletions spanning CDKN2A. Although sequencing of CDKN2A and TP53 failed to identify a mutation, a heterozygous CDKN2A deletion was identified by targeted array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH). Whole-genome oligonucleotide array CGH and SNP analysis identified an interstitial deletion of at least 1.5 Mb within 9p21.3 and spanning approximately 25 genes. Identification of the underlying molecular abnormality permits predictive testing for at-risk relatives. Given the young cancer diagnoses, a surveillance regimen was developed and a clinical team organised for ongoing management so that genetic testing could be offered to both adults and minor children.

In a series of 29 nodular and 29 superficial spreading melanomas, matched for all histological prognostic parameters, securin expression was significantly correlated with the nodular subtype (P=0.018) and not related to thickness. In other cancers, hPTTG1 is involved in various oncogenic pathways, including induction of neovascularisation and aneuploidy, and inhibition of p53 activity.

Expression of securin was significantly correlated with the extent of aneuploidy but not with basic fibroblast growth factor immunoreactivity or microvessel density. DNA cytometry revealed that nuclei-overexpressing securin frequently showed tetraploidy or aneuploidy. Our data show that hPTTG1 is frequently overexpressed in nodular melanoma, and suggest that hPTTG1 may act as an oncogene in the vertical growth phase, either by inhibiting anaphase, thereby causing aneuploidy and genomic instability, or by modulating the function of p53, thereby impairing apoptosis.",

Despite the latest success of BRAF V600E-targeted therapies, responses are typically short lived and relapse is all but certain. Furthermore, a percentage (40%) of melanoma cells is BRAF wild type. Emerging evidence suggests a role for normal host cells in the occurrence of drug resistance. In the current study, we compared a variety of cell culture models with an organotypic incomplete skin culture model (the \"dermal equivalent\") to investigate the role of the tissue microenvironment in the response of melanoma cells to the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (Dox). In the dermal equivalent model, consisting of fibroblasts embedded in type I collagen matrix, melanoma cells showed a decreased cytotoxic response when compared with less complex culture conditions, such as seeding on plastic cell culture plate (as monolayers cultures) or on collagen gel. We further investigated the role of the microenvironment in p53 induction and caspase 3 and 9 cleavage. Melanoma cell lines cultured on dermal equivalent showed decreased expression of p53 after Dox treatment, and this outcome was accompanied by induction of interleukin IL-6, IL-8, and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9. Here, we show that the growth of melanoma cells in the dermal equivalent model inflects drug responses by recapitulating important pro-survival features of the tumor microenvironment. These studies indicate that the presence of stroma enhances the drug resistance of melanoma in vitro, more closely mirroring the in vivo phenotype. Our data, thus, demonstrate the utility of organotypic cell culture models in providing essential context-dependent information critical for the development of new therapeutic strategies for melanoma. We believe that the organotypic model represents an improved screening platform to investigate novel anti-cancer agents, as it provides important insights into tumor-stromal interactions, thus assisting in the elucidation of chemoresistance mechanisms.

Here we report that mice with melanocyte-specific expression of activated H-rasG12V on an ink4a-deficient background develop spontaneous cutaneous melanomas after a short latency and with high penetrance. Consistent loss of the wild-type ink4a allele was observed in tumors arising in ink4a heterozygous transgenic mice. No homozygous deletion of the neighboring ink4b gene was detected. Moreover, as in human melanomas, the p53 gene remained in a wild-type configuration with no observed mutation or allelic loss. These results show that loss of ink4a and activation of Ras can cooperate to accelerate the development of melanoma and provide the first in vivo experimental evidence for a causal relationship between ink4a deficiency and the pathogenesis of melanoma. In addition, this mouse model affords a system in which to identify and analyze pathways involved in tumor progression against the backdrop of genetic alterations encountered in human melanomas.",

Repurposing approved and abandoned non-oncological drugs is an alternative approach to the identification and development of anticancer therapeutics, and antimalarials that target autophagic-lysosomal functions have recently attracted considerable attention as candidates for oncological repurposing. Since cumulative research suggests that dependence on autophagy represents a specific vulnerability of malignant melanoma cells, we screened a focused compound library of antimalarials for antimelanoma activity. Here we report for the first time that amodiaquine (AQ), a clinical 4-aminoquinoline antimalarial with unexplored cancer-directed chemotherapeutic potential, causes autophagic-lysosomal and proliferative blockade in melanoma cells that surpasses that of its parent compound chloroquine. Monitoring an established set of protein markers (LAMP1, LC3-II, SQSTM1) and cell ultrastructural changes detected by electron microscopy, we observed that AQ treatment caused autophagic-lysosomal blockade in malignant A375 melanoma cells, a finding substantiated by detection of rapid inactivation of lysosomal cathepsins (CTSB, CTSL, CTSD). AQ-treatment was associated with early induction of energy crisis (ATP depletion) and sensitized melanoma cells to either starvation- or chemotherapeutic agent-induced cell death. AQ displayed potent antiproliferative effects, and gene expression array analysis revealed changes at the mRNA (CDKN1A, E2F1) and protein level (TP53, CDKN1A, CCND1, phospho-RB1 [Ser 780]/[Ser 807/811], E2F1) consistent with the observed proliferative blockade in S-phase. Taken together, our data suggest that the clinical antimalarial AQ is a promising candidate for repurposing efforts that aim at targeting autophagic-lysosomal function and proliferative control in malignant melanoma cells.

The level of survivin expression was significantly higher in the p53 positive group of melanomas compared with the p53 negative one, suggesting a cooperative effect in favouring the progression of melanoma, while no correlation was found between survivin and p16. Moreover, the altered expression of nuclear survivin, p53 and p16 were all associated with poor survival, as demonstrated by univariate analysis. However, these biomarkers have been shown to have superior predictive value when studied in combination (P<0.0001) rather than alone, while the risk of mortality grew progressively with increasing the number of altered biomarkers.

        "Doc_abstract":"Cellular senescence, the irreversible proliferative arrest seen in somatic cells after a limited number of divisions, is considered a crucial barrier to cancer, but direct evidence for this in vivo was lacking until recently. The best-known form of human cell senescence is attributed to telomere shortening and a DNA-damage response through p53 and p21. There is also a more rapid form of senescence, dependent on the p16-retinoblastoma pathway. p16 (CDKN2A) is a known melanoma susceptibility gene. Here, we use retrovirally mediated gene transfer to confirm that the normal form of senescence in cultured human melanocytes involves p16, since disruption of the p16/retinoblastoma pathway is required as well as telomerase activation for immortalisation. Expression (immunostaining) patterns of senescence mediators and markers in melanocytic lesions provide strong evidence that cell senescence occurs in benign melanocytic naevi (moles) in vivo and does not involve p53 or p21 upregulation, although p16 is widely expressed. In comparison, dysplastic naevi and early (radial growth-phase, RGP) melanomas show less p16 and some p53 and p21 immunostaining. All RGP melanomas expressed p21, suggesting areas of p53-mediated senescence, while most areas of advanced (vertical growth-phase) melanomas lacked both p16 and p21, implying escape from both forms of senescence (immortalisation). Moreover, nuclear p16 but not p21 expression can be induced in human melanocytes by oncogenic BRAF, as found in around 80% of naevi. We conclude that cell senescence can form a barrier to melanoma development. This also provides a potential explanation of why p16 is a melanoma suppressor gene.",

Numerous studies have focused on the role of p16(INK4a) in melanoma, but the involvement of ARF, a well-known p53 activator, is still controversial. Using a transgenic BRAF(V600E) mouse model previously generated in our laboratory, we report that loss of ARF is able to enhance spontaneous melanoma formation and cause profound sensitivity to neonatal UVB exposure. Mechanistically, BRAF(V600E) and ARF deletion synergize to inhibit nucleotide excision repair by epigenetically repressing XPC and inhibiting the E2F4/DP1 complex.

However, it has been unclear how PKCα may be regulated and how it exerts its role in melanoma. Here, we identified a role for PKCα in melanoma cell survival in a three-dimensional collagen model mimicking the in vivo pathophysiology of the dermis. A pathway was identified that involved integrin αv-mediated up-regulation of PKCα and PKCα-dependent regulation of p53 localization, which was connected to melanoma cell survival. Melanoma survival and growth in three-dimensional microenvironments requires the expression of integrin αv, which acts to suppress p53 activity. Interestingly, microarray analysis revealed that PKCα was up-regulated by integrin αv in a three-dimensional microenvironment-dependent manner. Integrin αv was observed to promote a relocalization of endogenous p53 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm upon growth in three-dimensional collagen as well as in vivo, whereas stable knockdown of PKCα inhibited the integrin αv-mediated relocalization of p53. Importantly, knockdown of PKCα also promoted apoptosis in three-dimensional collagen and in vivo, resulting in reduced tumor growth. This indicates that PKCα constitutes a crucial component of the integrin αv-mediated pathway(s) that promote p53 relocalization and melanoma survival.",

Clinical symptoms are nonspecific, clinical behavior and biology features may differ from those in an adult population. The most important prognostic factor is spread of disease. Surgical resection is treatment of choice for localized melanoma. Advanced and metastatic melanoma is still an incurable disease.;We are presenting an eight-year- old boy with metastatic malignant melanoma of unknown origin based on TP53 mutation (Li Fraumeni syndrome). He underwent surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy (temozolomide as single agent). Complete remission was achieved at the end of treatment. Two years after the end of therapy (and 31 months from diagnosis) he developed metastatic progression to the lungs. He has received immunotherapy with ipilimumab, according to our knowledge as the first child under the age of 12 in Europe. He completed three courses of ipilimumab, with irAE (immune related adverse event) grade III during the first course of anti CTLA 4. Therefore, further doses of ipilimumab were given with corticoids and antihistamines as premedication. Also, asymptomatic thyreoiditis grade II has been confirmed. The best documented treatment response is stable disease. Performance status was excellent. Three years since the first progression, he developed further massive progression to the lungs. Second line immunotherapy with anti-PD 1 monoclonal antibody (pembrolizumab) is currently going on. So far, the overall survival of the patient is 74 months.;The presented case study supports the administration of immunotherapy in children younger than 12 years. Therapeutic effect has led to significant overall survival with tolerable toxicity. The problem remains significantly limited number of pediatric clinical trials using immunotherapy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Dacarbazine (DTIC) has been used for the treatment of melanoma for decades. However, monotherapy with this chemotherapeutic agent results only in moderate response rates. To improve tumor response to DTIC current clinical trials in melanoma focus on combining a novel targeted agent with chemotherapy. Here, we demonstrate that tyrosinase which is commonly overexpressed in melanoma activates the bioflavonoid quercetin (Qct) and promotes an ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent DNA damage response. This response sensitizes melanoma cells that overexpress tyrosinase to DTIC. In DB-1 melanoma cells that overexpress tyrosinase (Tyr(+) cells), the threshold for phosphorylation of ATM and p53 at serine 15 was observed at a low dose of Qct (25 microM) when compared to the mock transfected pcDNA3 cells, which required a higher dose (75 microM). Both pcDNA3 and Tyr(+) DB-1 cells demonstrated similar increases in phosphorylation of p53 at other serine sites, but in the Tyr(+) cells, DNApk expression was found to be reduced compared to control cells, indicating a shift towards an ATM-mediated response. The DB-1 control cells were resistant to DTIC, but were sensitized to apoptosis with high dose Qct, while Tyr(+) cells were sensitized to DTIC with low or high dose Qct. Qct also sensitized SK Mel 5 (p53 wildtype) and 28 (p53 mutant) cells to DTIC. However, when SK Mel 5 cells were transiently transfected with tyrosinase and treated with Qct plus DTIC, SK Mel 5 cells demonstrated a more than additive induction of apoptosis. Therefore, this study demonstrates that tyrosinase overexpression promotes an ATM-dependent p53 phosphorylation by Qct treatment and sensitizes melanoma cells to dacarbazine. In conclusion, these results suggest that Qct or Qct analogues may significantly improve DTIC response rates in tumors that express tyrosinase.",

IL-1 family member proteins are known to be expressed constitutively in many melanoma tumor cells, and we hypothesize that these support molecular pathways of inflammation and facilitate tumor growth. To investigate the expression of IL-1α and IL-1β in melanoma patients, and their association with disease progression, immunohistochemical staining was carried out on tissues from 170 patients including benign nevi, primary melanomas, and metastatic melanomas. IL-1β levels were low (or zero) in benign nevi and higher in primary and metastatic melanomas (P < 0.0001). IL-1α was expressed in about 73% of nevi and 55% of metastatic melanomas, with levels significantly higher in primary tumors (P < 0.0001); most (98%) primary melanoma samples were positive for IL-1α. In vitro studies with seven human melanoma cell lines showed that five cell lines expressed IL-1α and IL-1β proteins and mRNA. We identified for the first time several important downstream signaling pathways affected by endogenous IL-1, including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, COX-2, and phosphorylated NF-κB inhibitor (IκB) and stress-activated protein kinase/c-jun-NH(2)-kinase; all of which were decreased by siRNA to IL-1s. Downregulation of IL-1α, IL-1β, or MyD88 substantially increased p21 and p53 levels. Treatment with IL-1 receptor type I neutralizing antibody or IL-1 pathway-specific siRNAs led to growth arrest in IL-1-positive melanoma cells. Furthermore, blocking the IL-1 pathway increased autophagy in IL-1-positive melanoma cells. These results indicate that the endogenous IL-1 system is functional in most human melanoma and interrupting its signaling inhibits the growth of IL-1-positive melanoma cells.",

Multiple sera of a subcohort of 33 patients were tested during progression from stage III to IV. Small interfering RNA-based loss-of-function experiments were done to assess effects of Ang-2 on melanoma cells.;Circulating levels of sAng-2 correlate with tumor progression in melanoma patients (P<0.0001) and patient survival (P=0.007). Analysis of serum samples during the transition from stage III to IV identified an increase of sAng-2 up to 400%. Comparative analyses revealed a 56% superiority of sAng-2 as predictive marker over the established marker S100beta. Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-PCR confirmed the prominent expression of Ang-2 by tumor-associated endothelial cells but identified Ang-2 also as a secreted product of melanoma cells themselves. Corresponding cellular experiments revealed that human melanoma-isolated tumor cells were Tie2 positive and that Ang-2 acted as an autocrine regulator of melanoma cell migration and invasion.;The experiments establish sAng-2 as a biomarker of melanoma progression and metastasis correlating with tumor load and overall survival. The identification of an autocrine angiopoietin/Tie loop controlling melanoma migration and invasion warrants further functional experiments and validate the angiopoietin/Tie system as a promising therapeutic target for human melanomas.",

This type of tumor is particularly resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and the surgery remains the principal treatment for patients with localized melanoma. For this reason, there is particular interest in the melanoma biological therapy.;Using two p53 mutant melanoma models stably expressing an inducible c-myc antisense RNA, we have investigated whether Myc protein down-regulation could render melanoma cells more susceptible to radiotherapy, reestablishing apoptotic p53-independent pathway. In addition to address the role of p53 in the activation of apoptosis, we studied the effect of Myc down-regulation on radiotherapy sensitivity also in a p53 wild-type melanoma cell line.;Myc down-regulation is able per se to induce apoptosis in a fraction of the cell population (approximately 40% at 72 hours) and in combination with gamma radiation efficiently enhances the death process. In fact, approximately 80% of apoptotic cells are evident in Myc down-regulated cells exposed to gamma radiation for 72 hours compared with approximately 13% observed after only gamma radiation treatment. Consistent with the enhanced apoptosis is the inhibition of the MLH1 and MSH2 mismatch repair proteins, which, preventing the correction of ionizing radiation mismatches occurring during DNA replication, renders the cells more prone to radiation-induced apoptosis.;Data herein reported show that Myc down-regulation lowers the apoptotic threshold in melanoma cells by inhibiting MLH1 and MSH2 proteins, thus increasing cell sensitivity to gamma radiation in a p53-independent fashion. Our results indicate the basis for developing new antitumoral therapeutic strategy, improving the management of melanoma patients.",

Malignant transformation of epidermal melanocytes is a multifactorial process involving cell cycle and death control pathways. The purpose of this study was to analyze the immunohistochemical expression of cell-cycle-related and apoptosis-related proteins in cutaneous superficial spreading melanomas using the tissue microarray technique to further understand tumor development. A total of 20 samples of in-situ melanomas and 44 melanomas <or=1.0 mm were analyzed in conventional sections whereas 72 melanomas greater than 1.0 mm and 29 metastases were evaluated by tissue microarray. The sections were stained for the following proteins: p16INK4 (p16), cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4), retinoblastoma protein, tumor suppressor protein p53, and p21 cell cycle regulator (p21) using a streptavidine-biotin-peroxidase technique for immunohistochemistry. Thick melanomas (>1.0 mm) and metastases lost p16 expression in 100% of the cases and in-situ and thin melanomas (<or=1.0 mm) had low rate of p16 expression (7.9%). When comparing thin versus thick melanomas, thin melanomas showed higher expression of cyclin D1 and cytoplasmatic Cdk4, and thick melanomas had increased expression of nuclear Cdk4, tumor suppressor protein p53, and p21. Primary tumors, when compared with metastases, had higher cytoplasmatic Cdk4 expression. None of the studied proteins influenced overall or disease-free survival. Our results suggest that loss of p16 expression was a constant feature in primary and metastatic melanomas. Cyclin D1 expression seems to be related to initial phases of melanoma development. An increase in p21 expression could represent a cell cycle control in proliferating cells with reduced p16 and/or increased nuclear Cdk4 expression.",

PERP protein levels were assessed by Western blot analysis of 22 fresh-frozen tumors and by immunohistochemical analysis of 16 paraffin-embedded tumor specimens. Differential expression of PERP was identified in primary choroidal melanoma specimens, both at transcriptional and protein level. Reduced PERP mRNA level was significantly associated with monosomy 3 (two-way ANOVA and t-test, p=0.004) but not with gains in chromosome 8. Transcriptional downregulation of PERP did not present a statistically significant association with ciliary body involvement, size, PAS-positive loops or cell type. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry further demonstrated significantly reduced PERP protein level in monosomy 3 melanomas, as compared with disomy 3 tumors. The altered expression of PERP highlighted this apoptosis-specific target of p53 as a possible contributor to apoptosis in uveal melanoma with PERP downregulation being particularly relevant to the aggressive (monosomy 3) type of uveal melanoma. As PERP is a novel type of p53 effector that is likely to stimulate apoptosis through a mechanism distinct from that of Bcl-2-related mitochondrial effectors, further elucidation of its role in uveal melanoma pathogenesis will assist in the design of novel therapeutic approaches aimed at increasing the rate of apoptosis in this tumor.",

In this report, we describe a 13-year-old boy with xeroderma pigmentosum presenting with squamous-cell carcinoma and melanoma arising at the same site on the nose. Histopathologically, the melanoma component of the lesion was located mainly eccentrically to the squamous-cell carcinoma component. Immunohistochemical stains confirmed the histopathologic findings. Mutations for p53 assessed using single-strand conformation polymorphism, and sequencing analysis revealed a CC-to-TT transition at codon 159 of the p53 gene in the squamous-cell component but not in the melanoma component. This finding suggests a possible role for UV in the pathogenesis of at least the squamous-cell component of the tumor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a collision tumor comprising squamous-cell carcinoma and melanoma arising in childhood.",

Our previous data showed that YB-1 is upregulated and translocated to the nucleus during melanoma progression and that YB-1 is an important transcription factor regulating proliferation, survival, migration, invasion and chemosensitivity of melanoma cells. It has been suggested that YB-1 is activated and translocated to the nucleus after S102-phosphorylation in the DNA binding domain. In this study, we show that activation of YB-1 by S102-phosphorylation and nuclear translocation is increased during melanoma progression using a human tissue microarray with 100 melanocytic lesions. Furthermore, we analysed the mechanisms governing the expression and activity of YB-1 in melanoma cells. We show that the PI3K/AKT and p53 signalling, growth factors and chemotherapeutic agents increase YB-1 promoter activity. This, however, resulted in no or only modest increase in YB-1 protein expression. We show that the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signalling pathways, both activated in melanoma cells, as well as p53 overexpression increase YB-1 S102-phosphorylation, whereas NFκB signalling inhibits phosphorylation. Overexpression of YB-1 in melanoma cells inhibits translation efficiency and by this proliferation and survival of melanoma cells indicating that there is an autoregulatory loop restricting YB-1 protein expression. These data suggest that there is a tightly regulated feedback mechanism regulating YB-1 expression and activation, necessary for proper cell cycle progression of melanoma cells.",

Where possible, tumor was microdissected at several sites. Genotyping involved assessment of loss of heterozygosity [LOH]), which was accomplished using a panel of nine polymorphic tetranucleotide microsatellites. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on the normal tissue sample to establish microsatellite heterozygous status. Informative markers were then tested on microdissected lesional tissue and scored for the presence and extent of allelic imbalance (AI). Microsatellite informativeness varied from 33% to 66%. Benign nevi were without AI. All invasive melanomas manifested acquired allelic loss, which involved 75% or 100% of the markers shown to be informative for each subject. Eleven of 13 (84%) primary melanomas demonstrated intratumoral heterogeneity of AI consistent with development of tumor subclones with differing genotypic profiles within thin as well as thick melanomas. Although a consistent pattern did not emerge among the markers, LOH of 9p21 (D9S254) occurred in 60% (9/15) of the cases followed by 40% of cases displaying LOH of 1p34, p53, 10q (MXI1), and 10q23 (D10S520) and 25% with 5q21 (D5S 592) abnormalities. A third of the cases including the metastatic foci demonstrated two different patterns of AI affecting alternative alleles of the same genomic marker within different parts of the melanoma. Two melanomas in situ did not display LOH of any markers in the informative cases although the in situ component in the invasive tumors had allelic losses that were in part similar to the invasive areas. The results of this study support the expanded use of microdissection genotyping and explore other markers to define the unique mutational profile for malignant melanoma that may complement other histologic characteristics of melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Wild-type p53 is commonly expressed in melanoma but does not appear to be effective in the induction of apoptosis. One explanation is that p53 is targeted for degradation by the E3 ligase MDM2. However, we found in this study that blockade of the interaction of p53 and MDM2 by the MDM2 antagonist nutlin-3 in melanoma cells did not induce apoptosis, even though it upregulated p53 and its proapoptotic targets. Nevertheless, nutlin-3 enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis as a result of p53-mediated upregulation of TRAIL-R2. Unexpectedly, nutlin-3 upregulated Mcl-1, which attenuated apoptotic signaling triggered by TRAIL, and inhibited apoptosis induced by the microtubule-targeting drug docetaxel. The increase in Mcl-1 was related to a p53-independent transcriptional mechanism, but stabilization of the Mcl-1 protein played a dominant role, as nutlin-3 upregulated the Mcl-1 protein to a much greater extent than the Mcl-1 mRNA, and this was associated with prolonged half-life time and reduced ubiquitination of the protein. Knockdown of p53 blocked the upregulation of the Mcl-1 protein, indicating that p53 plays a critical role in the stabilization of Mcl-1. The contrasting effects of nutlin-3 on TRAIL- and docetaxel-induced apoptosis were confirmed in fresh melanoma isolates. Collectively, these results show that nutlin-3 may be a useful agent in combination with TRAIL and, importantly, uncover a novel regulatory effect of p53 on the expression of Mcl-1 in melanoma cells on treatment with nutlin-3, which may antagonize the therapeutic efficacy of other chemotherapeutic drugs in addition to docetaxel in melanoma.",

Growth of B16F10 melanoma was retarded in the KO mice compared with the wild-type CD43+/+ control (WT). A marked difference in lung colonization and other metastatic foci was observed in the KO and WT mice up to 15 days after intravenous injection of tumour cells. The initial resistance of KO mice was reversed with time, and in the long term there was no difference in the survival rate of the two animal groups. Transient resistance was attributed to increased adhesion of thrombin-activated platelets and leukocytes to melanoma and endothelial cells in KO mice. In the KO mice tumour emboli were found in the central portion of the lung more than at the lung periphery immediately after intravenous injection, in contrast to the WT mice. Activation of melanoma adhesion receptors by thrombin or TRAP stimulated lung colonization in WT but not KO mice.

These mechanisms include the RB and/or the p53 pathway. The current model of melanomagenesis postulates that progression to immortal melanoma cells requires inactivating aberrations in signaling cascades controlling senescence. Thus, melanoma cells carrying mutant B-Raf should be resistant to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway-induced senescence. Here, we demonstrate that hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway following activation of an inducible form of oncogenic C-Raf induces a senescence-like proliferation arrest in B-Raf mutant melanoma cells. This Raf-induced senescence is initially strictly dependent on MEK signaling, but seems to be independent of MAPK signaling after prolonged continuance. It is associated with reduced levels of RB phosphorylation and an increase in p21 expression, but is independent of p16(Ink4a) and p53.

By performing complementary DNA microarray analysis, we identified four key components of the nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery-CRM1, RAN (RAN-GTPase), RANGAP1, and RANBP1-to be overexpressed in human melanoma metastases. Chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1) inhibition induced a marked depletion of prosurvival/cytoplasmic extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase1 and elicited persistent Erk-signaling hyperactivation. Consistently, CRM1 inhibition inflicted extensive apoptosis in melanoma cells while sparing nontransformed melanocytes and primary lung fibroblasts. Apoptosis required both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways and was associated with a nuclear entrapment and downregulation of the antiapoptotic CRM1 target protein, Survivin. Apoptosis was preceded by a G1 cell-cycle arrest, and even though CRM1 inhibition mediated marked p53 and p21 induction in wild-type p53 melanoma cells, the latter's silencing or inactivation failed to alleviate apoptosis. Notably, CRM1 inhibition induced cell line-specific, G1 to S progression-retarding changes in the expression of multiple cell-cycle regulatory proteins, thus potentially explaining p53 dispensability. We propose CRM1 as a potential therapeutic target in human melanoma, whose inhibition induces loss of prosurvival/cytoplasmic Erk1/2, mediates persistent Erk hyperactivation, and initiates a multitude of cell context-dependent molecular events to trigger G1 arrest followed by massive apoptosis.",

Using stable transfectants of this cell line, we showed that mutant N-Ras decreased the proliferation rate by inducing a prolonged cell cycle arrest. In contrast, c-Myc made these melanoma cells more prone to radiation-induced cell death. Membrane blebbing, the formation of apoptotic bodies and caspase activation, as measured by cleavage of Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD) substrate and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), indicate that these cells die by an apoptotic process. c-Myc also sensitized these p53-deficient melanoma cells to treatment with various cytotoxic drugs and heat shock. Similar results were obtained in inducible c-Myc models of IGR39D and in another melanoma cell line, 9007, which expresses functional p53. Together, these findings indicate that c-Myc is capable of sensitizing typically resistant tumour cells and that this occurs irrespective of the functional status of the p53 protein.

Tumor angiogenesis represents an integral component of cancer metastasis prompting us to investigate a possible role of mda-9/syntenin in inducing angiogenesis. Genetic (gain-of-function and loss-of-function) and pharmacologic approaches were used to modify mda-9/syntenin expression in normal immortal melanocytes, early radial growth phase melanoma, and metastatic melanoma cells. The consequence of modifying mda-9/syntenin expression on angiogenesis was evaluated using both in vitro and in vivo assays, including tube formation assays using human vascular endothelial cells, chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays and xenograft tumor animal models. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments confirm that MDA-9/syntenin induces angiogenesis by augmenting expression of several proangiogenic factors/genes. Experimental evidence is provided for a model of angiogenesis induction by MDA-9/syntenin in which MDA-9/syntenin interacts with the extracellular matrix (ECM), activating Src and FAK resulting in activation by phosphorylation of Akt, which induces hypoxia inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α). The HIF-1α activates transcription of insulin growth factor-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), which is secreted thereby promoting angiogenesis and further induces endothelial cells to produce and secrete VEGF-A augmenting tumor angiogenesis. Our studies delineate an unanticipated cell nonautonomous function of MDA-9/syntenin in the context of angiogenesis, which may directly contribute to its metastasis-promoting properties. As a result, targeting MDA-9/syntenin or its downstream-regulated molecules may provide a means of simultaneously impeding metastasis by both directly inhibiting tumor cell transformed properties (autonomous) and indirectly by blocking angiogenesis (nonautonomous).",

During normal skin function, p53 in the keratinocyte is a transducer of the skin tanning signal and an essential component of what is effectively a keratinocyte-melanocyte signaling cycle that regulates skin pigmentation. It is clear that this cycle functions optimally in skin of dark pigmentation. When melanin biosynthesis is genetically disrupted in skin of white complexion, we propose that this cycle operates as a promoter of melanocyte proliferation. The cell autonomous function of p53 in melanocytes is not well described, however, the balance of the evidence suggests that p53 is an effective tumor suppressor and the myriad of mechanisms by which the p53 pathway may be dysregulated in tumors attests to it importance as a tumor suppressor. In this review, we outline the known mechanisms that impair p53 itself and its immediate regulators or target genes during melanomagenesis. Due to the importance of this pathway, it is clear that p53 disruptions may relate directly to a patient's prognosis. This pathway will continue to be a focus of investigation, particularly with respect to targeted experimental chemotherapeutics.",

Increased expression of uPAR is associated with metastasis in several tumor types. We studied the biological role of uPAR in melanoma and found that inhibition of uPAR via RNA interference induced massive death in three different metastatic cell lines. Annexin-V staining and caspase activation analysis revealed induction of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The expression of members of the Bcl-2 family (Bax, Bcl-2, Bak and Bcl-x(L)) was changed in a pro-apoptotic manner. uPAR inhibition induced the expression of the tumor suppressor p53 and of its downstream target gene p21. Inhibition of p53 rescued cells from apoptosis indicating that p53 was critical for apoptosis induction. Apoptosis was observed in melanoma cells carrying activating BRAF mutations and occurred in the presence of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. uPAR can activate focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is implicated in adhesion-dependent tumor cell survival. However, inhibition of FAK did not induce apoptosis. Our data suggest a new function of uPAR acting as a survival factor for melanoma by downregulating p53. Inhibition of uPAR induces a pro-apoptotic signalling pathway via p53 that is independent of ERK or FAK signalling. These findings may offer new treatment strategies for metastatic melanoma.",

Metformin caused a G(2)/M cell cycle arrest associated with apoptotic death of melanoma cells, as confirmed by the flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle/DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine exposure and caspase activation. Metformin-mediated apoptosis of melanoma cells was preceded by induction of oxidative stress and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, measured by flow cytometry in cells stained with appropriate fluorescent reporter dyes. The expression of tumor suppressor protein p53 was increased, while the mRNA levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 were reduced by metformin, as revealed by cell-based ELISA and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. Treatment with metformin did not stimulate expression of the cycle blocker p21, indicating that p21 was dispensable for the observed cell cycle arrest. The activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was not required for the anti-melanoma action of metformin, as AMPK inhibitor compound C completely failed to restore viability of metformin-treated B16 cells. Metformin induced autophagy in B16 cells, as demonstrated by flow cytometry-detected increase in intracellular acidification and immunoblot-confirmed upregulation of autophagosome-associated LC3-II. Autophagy inhibitors ammonium chloride and wortmannin partly restored the viability of metformin-treated melanoma cells. Finally, oral administration of metformin led to a significant reduction in tumor size in a B16 mouse melanoma model. These data suggest that anti-melanoma effects of metformin are mediated through p21- and AMPK-independent cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and autophagy associated with p53/Bcl-2 modulation, mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress.",

Wild-type p53 protein levels are relatively low in these cancer cells (i.e. when compared with cells without S100B) but are elevated when RNA antisense to S100B is introduced. This result implicates S100B in the down-regulation of p53 and is consistent with the large decreases in p53 protein levels observed previously in transient co-transfections of p53 and S100B (Lin, J., Blake, M., Tang, C., Zimmer, D., Rustandi, R. R., Weber, D. J., and Carrier, F. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 35037-35041). Down-regulation of p53 in primary malignant melanoma cells is likely the result of a direct interaction with S100B, which was observed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Furthermore, p53 binds regions of the S100B promoter, one of which matches the 20-nucleotide p53-binding consensus DNA sequence perfectly. Therefore, when p53 levels increase, it contributes to its own demise by up-regulating the transcription of S100B as part of a negative feedback loop. This is analogous to what is found for another protein that down-regulates p53, namely hdm2 (human double mutant 2).",

SKI is upregulated in human malignant melanoma tumors in a disease-progression manner and its overexpression promotes proliferation and migration of melanoma cells in vitro. The mechanisms by which SKI antagonizes TGF-beta signaling in vivo have not been fully elucidated. Here we show that human melanoma cells in which endogenous SKI expression was knocked down by RNAi produced minimal orthotopic tumor xenograft nodules that displayed low mitotic rate and prominent apoptosis. These minute tumors exhibited critical signatures of active TGF-beta signaling including high levels of nuclear Smad3 and p21(Waf-1), which are not found in the parental melanomas. To understand how SKI promotes tumor growth we used gain- and loss-of-function approaches and found that simultaneously to blocking the TGF-beta-growth inhibitory pathway, SKI promotes the switch of Smad3 from tumor suppression to oncogenesis by favoring phosphorylations of the Smad3 linker region in melanoma cells but not in normal human melanocytes. In this context, SKI is required for preventing TGF-beta-mediated downregulation of the oncogenic protein c-MYC, and for inducing the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, a mediator of tumor growth and angiogenesis. Together, the results indicate that SKI exploits multiple regulatory levels of the TGF-beta pathway and its deficiency restores TGF-beta tumor suppressor and apoptotic activities in spite of the likely presence of oncogenic mutations in melanoma tumors.",

Furthermore, 4-NC was able to induce the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, including classic targets of this process such as Mcl-1. As shown for other proteasomal inhibitors in melanoma, the cytotoxic action of 4-NC is time-dependent upon the pro-apoptotic protein Noxa, which is able to bind and neutralize Mcl-1.

Elevated Ki67 expression and positive staining for p53 correlated to the propensity to metastasize (P = .016) and to declined disease-specific survival, as well as to shortened recurrence-free survival.

Herein, we reported that 3,3'-diselenodipropionic acid (DSeA), a Selenocysteine derivative, could synergistically enhance the growth inhibitory effect of TRAIL on A375 melanoma cells though induction of ROS-dependent apoptosis with involvement of PTEN-mediated Akt inactivation and DNA damage-mediated p53 phosphorylation, which subsequently activated mitochondrial and death receptor apoptotic pathways. Moreover, silencing of p53 down-regulated the expression levels of p53-inducible genes, and effectively blocked the cell apoptosis. Suppression of PI3K signiﬁcantly increased the apoptotic cell death. In contrast, antioxidants effectively reversed the cell apoptosis through regulation of Akt and p53 signaling pathways. Taken together, the combination of DSeA and TRAIL could be a novel strategy to overcome TRAIL resistance in malignant melanoma, and DSeA may be candidates for further evaluation as a chemosensitizer in clinical trails.

Gal-1 depletion in the B16F10 tumor cells but not in the tumor-bearing mice significantly increased melanoma-bearing mice survival. Tumor-derived gal-1 thus seems to have more critical roles than the host-derived one. In fact, gal-1 displays distinct effects on the H-Ras-dependent p53/p21 pathways: in primary lung microvessel endothelial cells, gal-1 seems to be involved in the maintenance of senescent status through the induction of both p53 and p21 while it stimulates B16F10 cancer cell proliferation through a p53/p21 decrease. Altogether, these data point to gal-1 as a potential target to combat melanomas.",

There is increasing evidence that this is related to differences in their molecular phenotype, particularly in relation to the expression of cell cycle-associated proteins. Since many cytotoxic agents act by damaging DNA, resistance is often associated with intact mechanisms which allow the neoplastic cells to arrest their growth while DNA is repaired, or to resist apoptosis in response to detection of DNA damage. p53 is important to these processes, but mutation appears to be a less common event in uveal melanoma than in skin melanoma, probably due to the lack of UV exposure in the uvea. There are also differences in proliferation-associated proteins such as c-myc and cyclin D1. Overexpression of the former molecule is associated with a poor prognosis in skin melanoma, but is associated with a good prognosis in uveal melanoma, although there is considerable genetic heterogeneity within each type. While prognostic studies may therefore be of little relevance to individual patients, they continue to inform our understanding of tumour biology.",

The expression of cyclin D1, p53, and MDM2 in uveal melanoma and their relationship to metastasis-free 5-year survival was determined, in order to investigate whether these proteins help to distinguish those patients with a favourable prognosis from those with a poorer one. Ninety-six eyes enucleated for uveal melanomas were immunohistochemically analysed for the protein expression of cyclin D1 and related cell-cycle markers, p53 and MDM2. The evaluation of the specimens was undertaken by two independent pathologists without knowledge of the outcome. Statistical analysis of clinical, morphological, and immunohistological features was performed. A 'favourable outcome' was defined as survival of at least 5 years after diagnosis, without metastases (n=57). An 'unfavourable outcome' was defined as death from metastases within the first 5 years after diagnosis of uveal melanoma (n=39). Cyclin D1 positivity (>15% positive tumour cells) as well as p53 positivity (>15% positive tumour cells) was associated with an unfavourable outcome (for cyclin D1: odds ratio=4. 2, 95% confidence interval 1.5-11.8, p=0.006; for p53: odds ratio=3. 2, 95% confidence interval 1.1-9.3, p=0.03). In addition, cyclin D1 positivity was associated with the presence of extraocular extension of the tumour (p=0.01), with the mixed or epithelioid cell type (p=0. 02), and with the tumour cell MIB-1 positivity (p=0.0001). MDM2 immunoreactivity of the tumour cells showed a potential correlation with clinical outcome (odds ratio=2.1, 95% confidence interval 0.8-5. 8, p=0.13). Multiple logistic regression models showed that cyclin D1 positivity is an independent prognostic factor after control for other prognostic markers. The expression of cyclin D1 in uveal melanoma is associated with a more aggressive course and histologically unfavourable disease. This could serve as a further independent prognostic factor in uveal melanoma.",

The amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of the protein, outside the ankyrin-like repeats, appeared to be dispensable, but the majority of the premature termination mutations led to loss of function. Of the missense mutations tested, four displayed clear loss of function whereas two behaved like the wild type under all conditions tested. The remaining two mutations, a G-to-W mutation at position 101 (Gl01W) and V126D, both of which are associated with familial melanoma, were found to be temperature sensitive for binding to Cdk4 and Cdk6 in vitro, for inhibiting cyclin D1-Cdk4 in a reconstituted pRb-kinase assay, and for increasing the proportion of G1-phase cells following transfection.

In this study, we have examined the molecular mechanism of docetaxel-induced apoptosis of human melanoma. We report that docetaxel induced varying degrees of apoptosis in a panel of melanoma cell lines but not in normal fibroblasts. Induction of apoptosis was caspase dependent and associated with changes in mitochondrial membrane potential that could be inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-2. Docetaxel induced changes in Bax that correlated with sensitivity to docetaxel-induced apoptosis. These changes in Bax were not inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-2. Kinetic studies of caspase-2 activation by Western blotting and fluorogenic assays revealed that activation of caspase-2 seemed to be the initiating event. Inhibition of caspase-2 with z-VDVAD-fmk or by small interfering RNA knockdown inhibited changes in Bax and mitochondrial membrane potential and events downstream of mitochondria. Activation of caspase-8 and Bid seemed to be a late event, and docetaxel was able to induce apoptosis in cells deficient in caspase-8 and Bid. p53 did not seem to be involved as a p53 null cell line was sensitive to docetaxel and an inhibitor of p53 did not inhibit apoptosis. Small interfering RNA knockdown of PUMA and Noxa also did not inhibit apoptosis. These results suggest that docetaxel induces apoptosis in melanoma cells by pathways that are dependent on activation of caspase-2, which initiates mitochondrial dependent apoptosis by direct or indirect activation of Bax.",

To test our hypothesis, we overexpressed RAGE in the WM115 human melanoma cell line that was established from a primary melanoma tumor of a patient. We show here that overexpression of RAGE in these cells is associated with mesenchymal-like morphologies of the cells. These cells demonstrate higher migration abilities and reduced proliferation properties, suggesting that the cells have switched to a metastatic phenotype. At the molecular level, we show that RAGE overexpression is associated with the up-regulation of the RAGE ligand S100B and the down-regulation of p53, ERK1/2, cyclin E and NF-kB.

Despite this, mice carrying these mutations developed melanoma with very early age of onset after neonatal UVR. Cdk4(R24C) did not affect the MC migration. Instead, independent of UVR exposure, interfollicular dermal MCs were more prevalent in Cdk4(R24C) mice. Subsequently, in adulthood, these mutants developed dermal MC proliferations reminiscent of superficial congenital naevi. Two types of melanoma were observed in this model. The location and growth pattern of the first was consistent with derivation from the naevi, while the second appeared to be of deep dermal origin.

The purpose of this study was to identify human chromosome(s) which could be responsible for conferring metastatic potential upon nonmetastatic mouse melanoma cells and therefore harbor the genes important for the metastatic properties of human melanoma cells. Seven mouse-human melanoma hybrids were examined; five were derived from the fusion of nonmetastatic (C19) and metastatic (C3) mouse K-1735 melanoma clones with highly metastatic clone (C15) of human melanoma A375 and the two others had as a human partner a nonmetastatic clone (Cls) of the A375 melanoma. The hybrids were examined during segregation of human chromosomes in vitro and in vivo for metastatic properties in nude mice and for the retaining human chromosomes. In the hybrid H7, which demonstrated the highest metastatic potential, the presence of human chromosomes was studied by GTG-banding and by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. In the other hybrids, only FISH detection of human chromosomes was applied. All hybrids derived from nonmetastatic mouse and metastatic human melanoma cells demonstrated metastatic properties from early passages, when they contained the majority of the human chromosomes. Their metastatic phenotype remained stable during further segregation of most of the human chromosomes except for 17. Chromosome 17 was retained most consistently in all examined hybrids. However, the metastatic phenotype of the hybrids was associated only with the presence of chromosome 17 from the metastatic human donor cells. This chromosome was also found in almost 100% of cells recovered from lung metastases derived from the hybrid cells. In one lung metastasis developed from the H7 hybrid, chromosome 17 was detected as the sole human chromosome and these cells preserved the acquired high metastatic properties. Based on these results we conclude that human chromosome 17 from metastatic melanoma cells (A375 C15), when functional in the mouse genetic background, can be sufficient to render the recipient nonmetastatic mouse cells to a fully malignant phenotype. Additional data suggest that this ability might be related to the expression of the mutated human p53 gene.",

Treatment of p53 wild-type melanoma cells with the genotoxic agent doxorubicin induces G2-M arrest, inhibitory phosphorylation of cell cycle kinase Cdc2 (CDK1) and enhanced expression of p53/p21. Wee1 inhibition under doxorubicin pulse-treatment reduces G2-M arrest and induces apoptosis. Inhibition of upstream kinase Chk1 under doxorubicin treatment almost completely abolishes stress-induced G2-M arrest and induces enhanced apoptosis. Interestingly, Chk1 inhibition alone even further increases apoptosis. While Chk1 inhibition alone almost completely abolishes G0-G1 arrest, combined treatment with doxorubicin re-establishes G0-G1 arrest. Moreover, Chk1 inhibition alone induces only a slight p53/p21 induction, while a strong induction of both proteins is observed by the combination with doxorubicin. These findings are suggestive for a particular role of p53/p21 in G0-G1, and Chk1 in G0-G1 and G2-M arrest. In line with this, the p53-mutant SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells do not mount a significant G0-G1 arrest under combined doxorubicin and Chk1 inhibitor treatment but rather show extensive apoptosis. Moreover, knockdown of p21 dramatically reduces stress-induced G0-G1 arrest under doxorubicin and Chk1 inhibitor treatment accompanied by massive DNA damage and apoptosis induction. Treatment of melanoma cells with an inhibitor of Chk2 upstream kinase ATM and doxorubicin almost completely abolishes G0-G1 arrest. Taken together, both Chk1 and Wee1 are mediators of G2-M arrest, while p53, p21 and Chk1 are mediators of G0-G1 arrest in melanoma cells. Combined treatment with chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin and Chk1 inhibitors may help to overcome apoptosis resistance of p53-proficient melanoma cells. But treatment with Chk1 inhibitor alone may even be more efficient.",

The modulatory effects of roscovitine on the growth and survival of normal melanocytes and cultured melanoma cell lines were tested. Additionally, we investigated the potential of roscovitine to regulate the growth and differentiation of a metastatic melanoma cell line (A375) in a three-dimensional skin reconstruction culture consisting of A375 cells admixed with normal human keratinocytes embedded within a collagen-constricted fibroblast matrix. We show that roscovitine is able to induce apoptosis in the melanoma cell lines A375, 888, and 624 but not in normal human cultured epithelial melanocytes. The degree of apoptosis within these cell lines correlated with the accumulation of p53 protein and concomitant reduction of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, with no change in the proteins Bcl-2 and survivin. We also found that roscovitine inhibited the growth and differentiation of A375 melanoma cells within the dermal layer of the skin. The results of this study show that roscovitine has the potential to inhibit the differentiation and invasion of metastatic melanoma and may be useful as a therapy for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma.",

The combination of these two core pharmacophores with modification in the C-8 position of the PBD ring with alkyl spacers afforded oxygen-tethered compounds 5a-5d and amide-tethered analogues 11a-11d with improved anticancer activity for two melanoma cell lines, A375 and RPMI7951, differing in their p53 status. The agents 5a-5d were cytotoxic in melanoma compared to agents 11a-11d. In particular, compounds 5b and 5c were found to possess the most potent activity compared with other hybrid agents and were proved with the help of quantitative structure activity relationship studies (QSAR). These PBD conjugates caused S phase arrest for the A375 cell line via increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/ATM-Rad3-related (ATR) and checkpoint kinases 1 (Chk1) activation. Moreover, the PBD-GA induced A375 apoptotic cell death followed through p53 (ATM downstream target) increase, B-cell leukemia-xL (Bcl-xL) and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨmt) decrease, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3/Poly Adp Ribose Polymerase (PARP) cleavage. On the other hand, mutant p53 RPMI7951 cell death occurred by PBD-GA-mediated mitochondria- and caspase-dependent pathways via lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), but not through p53 signaling. Finally, compound 5b was shown to reduce murine melanoma size in a mouse model. These results suggest that the PBD-GA could be used as a useful chemotherapeutic agent in melanoma with activated p53 or mutant p53. ",

The response of two melanoma cell lines (SK-MEL-2 derived from malignant melanoma metastasis and SK-MEL-28 derived from primary malignant melanoma) was examined after treatment with these substances. The antifolate agents induced apoptosis in SK-MEL-2 and SK-MEL-28 cells as confirmed by the TUNEL technique and Comet Assay. Western-blot analysis showed a down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein level and PARP cleavage, otherwise p53 and Bax expressions were not modulated. Moreover, these antifolate-induced apoptosis was accompanied by both pro-caspase-9 and -8 activations. These results were supported by the use of the pan-caspases inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK that almost completely decreased the amount of apoptosis in both the melanoma cell lines treated with antifolate.

Elevated levels of 8-OHdG have been regarded as an independent prognostic factor in different types of cancer. Various enzymes, such as human 8-oxoguanine DNA-glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), act as protection against oxidative stress. The low activity of such enzymes has been consistently associated with increased risk of progression in several tumor types. The aim of this study was to investigate whether 8-OHdG, hOGG1 and G6PD expression in tumor tissues might be a predictor of survival in melanoma patients. The expression of 8-OHdG, hOGG1 and G6PD was immunohistochemically investigated in primary cutaneous melanoma and the effect on survival was analyzed. Furthermore, the immunostaining for p53 and survivin was evaluated and the relationship among 8-OHdG, hOGG1, G6PD, p53 and survivin expression was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with low expression of nuclear 8-OHdG had significantly longer survival time compared with those with a high expression (P=0.032), whereas cancer-specific survival of patients was not associated with hOGG1 or G6PD expression.

In this study, we purified the sesquiterpene lactones (SLs), Tomentosin and Inuviscolide from Inula viscosa (Compositae) leaves and studied their anti-cancer potency against human melanoma cell lines in order to develop new agents for melanoma treatment. SLs inhibited the proliferation of three human melanoma cell lines: SK-28, 624 mel and 1363 mel in a dose-dependent manner. We further investigated SLs mechanism of action using SK-28 as a representative cell line model. SLs caused cell-cycle arrest at G(2)/M, accompanied by the appearance of a sub-G0 fraction, indicative of apoptotic cell death. Induction of apoptosis was further confirmed by changes in membrane phospholipids, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi) and by detection of Caspase-3 activity. Rapid inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2 (Thr14 and Tyr15) was seen early after treatment, followed by a later decrease in the expression level of both Cyclin b1 and Cdc2. Induction of p53 and p21(waf1) proteins and phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 were also detected early after treatment. The anti-apoptotic proteins, p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), and Survivin were reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these changes partially explain the ability of the SLs to induce G(2)/M arrest and apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis by Tomentosin and Inuviscolide in human aggressive melanoma cell lines has high pharmacological value and implies that SLs might be developed as new agents for melanoma treatment.",

DNA repair pathways are multiple and are able to repair, usually in an error-free manner, all kinds of DNA damage induced by exogenous and endogenous genotoxic agents. This review describes the role of DNA repair process in protecting us from cancer and particularly nucleotide excision deficiencies that are associated with melanoma development. Resistance of tumoral cells to antitumoral regimen can be caused by overexpression of DNA repair processes. We showed that melanoma metastasis was associated with higher expression of some DNA repair pathways leading to a better surveillance of replication fork fidelity. We showed a partially coordinated regulation of these repair genes. P53 and several transcription factors may regulate numerous of these repair genes. The repair pathways that are overexpressed in metastatic melanoma are those particularly efficient in repairing the major DNA damage produced by cytotoxic treatments. This implies that better analysis of DNA repair regulation is necessary to identify novel therapeutic targets and to allow clinicians to propose tailored therapies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Methionine deprivation stress (MDS) eliminates mitotic activity in melanoma cells regardless of stage, grade, or TP53 status, whereas it has a negligible effect on normal skin fibroblasts. In most cases, apoptosis accounts for the elimination of up to 90% of tumor cells from the culture within 72 hours after MDS, leaving a scattered population of multinucleated resistant cells. Loss of mitosis in tumor cells is associated with marked reduction of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1 transcription and/or loss of its active form (CDK1-P-Thr(161)), which is coincident with up-regulation of CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN1C (p21, p27, and p57). Expression of the proapoptotic LITAF, IFNGR, EREG, TNFSF/TNFRSF10 and TNFRSF12, FAS, and RNASEL is primarily up-regulated/induced in cells destined to undergo apoptosis. Loss of Aurora kinase B and BIRC5, which are required for histone H3 phosphorylation, is associated with the accumulation of surviving multinucleated cells. Nevertheless, noncycling survivors of MDS are sensitized to temozolomide, carmustin, and cisplatin to a much greater extent than normal skin fibroblasts possibly because of the suppression of MGMT/TOP1/POLB, MGMT/RAD52/RAD54, and cMET/RADD52, respectively. Sensitivity to these and additional genotoxic agents and radiation may also be acquired due to loss of cMET/OGG1, reduced glutathione reductase levels, and a G(2)-phase block that is a crucial step in the damage response associated with enhancement of drug toxicity. Although the genes controlling mitotic arrest and/or apoptosis in response to low extracellular methionine levels are unknown, it is likely that such control is exerted via the induction/up-regulation of tumor suppressors/growth inhibitor genes, such as TGFB, PTEN, GAS1, EGR3, BTG3, MDA7, and the proteoglycans (LUM, BGN, and DCN), as well as the down-regulation/loss of function of prosurvival genes, such as NFkappaB, MYC, and ERBB2.

Temozolomide, a promising new derivative of dacarbazine, is currently being tested for treatment of metastatic melanoma. Resistance to alkylating agents such as temozolomide correlates with increased expression of DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Interleukin-24 (IL-24; mda-7) is a tumor suppressor cytokine that selectively inhibits tumor cell growth by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in melanoma cell lines and solid tumors. This tumor-selective activity has been observed in multiple preclinical animal models and in clinical trials. In this study, we analyzed the ability of Ad-IL-24 and its protein product, IL-24, to overcome temozolomide resistance in human melanoma cells. We have shown that Ad-IL-24 via exogenous IL-24 protein induces combinatorial synergy of temozolomide-induced cell killing in temozolomide-resistant melanoma cells by inhibition of MGMT. Neutralizing antibodies against IL-24 or its receptors significantly blocked the apoptotic activity of IL-24 + MGMT treatment. We show that accumulation of functional p53 is essential for IL-24-induced down-regulation of MGMT. Using either MGMT small interfering RNA, p53 small interfering RNA, or a p53 dominant-negative mutant to block MGMT protein expression resulted in increased sensitization to temozolomide. However, MGMT blockade in combination with IL-24 + temozolomide resulted in loss of combinatorial synergy, indicating that MGMT expression is required for the reversal of temozolomide resistance in melanoma cells. This study shows that IL-24 can play a significant role in overcoming temozolomide resistance and that the clinical efficacy of temozolomide may be improved by using a biochemotherapy combination with IL-24.",

We previously sequenced 24 cancer genes in those cell lines. Eleven of the genes were found to be mutated in three or more of the lines. Using a pharmacogenomic approach, we analyzed the relationship between drug activity and mutations in those 11 genes (APC, RB1, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, STK11, MADH4, TP53, and CDKN2A). That analysis identified an association between mutation in BRAF and the antiproliferative potential of phenothiazine compounds. Phenothiazines have been used as antipsychotics and as adjunct antiemetics during cancer chemotherapy and more recently have been reported to have anticancer properties. However, to date, the anticancer mechanism of action of phenothiazines has not been elucidated. To follow up on the initial pharmacologic observations in the NCI-60 screen, we did pharmacologic experiments on 11 of the NCI-60 cell lines and, prospectively, on an additional 24 lines. The studies provide evidence that BRAF mutation (codon 600) in melanoma as opposed to RAS mutation is predictive of an increase in sensitivity to phenothiazines as determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay (Wilcoxon P = 0.007). That pattern of increased sensitivity to phenothiazines based on the presence of codon 600 BRAF mutation may be unique to melanomas, as we do not observe it in a panel of colorectal cancers.

In effect, many existing cancer treatments restore the function of 1 or the other of these mechanisms. For example, chemotherapy and radiotherapy often kill tumor cells by initiating a genetic suicide mechanism (apoptosis), and immunotherapy initiates or enhances a response by the body's immune cells to identify and destroy cancer cells by mechanisms that rely on direct cytotoxicity or apoptotic cell death. Nevertheless, standard therapeutic approaches have not proved effective in treatment of canine malignant melanoma, with only marginal improvement in the outcome of dogs with this disease. The advantages of an improved understanding of the molecular basis of canine cancer are underscored by recent promising advances in diagnosis and in immunologic and genetic therapies that may help reduce the mortality of dogs affected with malignant melanoma.",

Because ultraviolet light can induce specific p53 mutations and is linked to the development of skin cancers, this study was done to determine the significance of p53 protein (p53p) overexpression in melanomas originating at different cutaneous sites varying in frequency of sunlight exposure.;Sixty-three paraffin embedded primary and metastatic melanoma biopsy specimens from 61 patients were deparaffinized and stained with the mouse monoclonal antibody DO-1 to wild-type and mutant p53p. Twenty-eight specimens were from primary tumors and 35 specimens were from lymph node, subcutaneous, or visceral metastases. The chi-square test was used to assess the significance of p53p overexpression, and the Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the impact of p53p overexpression on survival.;Of the 61 patients studied, 37 had primary cutaneous melanomas arising on chronically sun-exposed head and neck sites, 12 patients on intermittently exposed extremity sites, and 12 patients on rarely exposed trunk sites. Thirteen of the 63 primary or metastatic specimens (21%) overexpressed p53p. Overexpression of p53p was not related to patient gender or age, anatomic site of the primary tumor, Clark level, or Breslow thickness. However, those patients with p53p positive primary tumors or metastases had significantly better survival than those determined to be negative for p53p overexpression (P = 0.045). The median survival was 152.4 months for p53p positive patients versus 55.7 months for p53p negative patients. The risk ratio of dying from melanoma was 0.32 for patients with tumor specimens overexpressing p53p.;In this study, p53p overexpression was infrequent in paraffin embedded melanoma specimens and independent of the primary melanoma's anatomic site. Although p53p overexpression was not related to other prognostic features of primary or metastatic lesions, it was associated with a significantly improved survival in this group of melanoma patients.",

Cultures of normal human melanocytes (NHMs) and melanoma lines were analyzed to determine whether global patterns of gene expression could predict the efficacy of DNA damage cell cycle checkpoints that arrest growth and suppress genetic instability. NHMs displayed effective G1 and G2 checkpoint responses to ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage. A majority of melanoma cell lines (11/16) displayed significant quantitative defects in one or both checkpoints. Melanomas with B-RAF mutations as a class displayed a significant defect in DNA damage G2 checkpoint function. In contrast the epithelial-like subtype of melanomas with wild-type N-RAS and B-RAF alleles displayed an effective G2 checkpoint but a significant defect in G1 checkpoint function. RNA expression profiling revealed that melanoma lines with defects in the DNA damage G1 checkpoint displayed reduced expression of p53 transcriptional targets, such as CDKN1A and DDB2, and enhanced expression of proliferation-associated genes, such as CDC7 and GEMININ. A Bayesian analysis tool was more accurate than significance analysis of microarrays for predicting checkpoint function using a leave-one-out method.

Here, we use a temperature-sensitive mitf zebrafish mutant to conditionally control endogenous MITF activity. We show that low levels of endogenous MITF activity are oncogenic with BRAF(V600E) to promote melanoma that reflects the pathology of the human disease. Remarkably, abrogating MITF activity in BRAF(V600E)mitf melanoma leads to dramatic tumor regression marked by melanophage infiltration and increased apoptosis.

To date, most studies which strongly implicate PTEN in the etiology of sporadic melanomas have depended on cell lines, short-term tumor cultures and noncultured metastatic melanomas. The only study which reports PTEN protein expression in melanoma focuses on cytoplasmic expression, mainly in metastatic samples. To determine how PTEN contributes to the etiology or the progression of primary cutaneous melanoma, we examined cytoplasmic and nuclear PTEN expression against clinical and pathologic features in a population-based sample of 150 individuals with incident primary cutaneous melanoma. Among 92 evaluable samples, 30 had no or decreased cytoplasmic PTEN protein expression and the remaining 62 had normal PTEN expression. In contrast, 84 tumors had no or decreased nuclear expression and 8 had normal nuclear PTEN expression. None of the clinical features studied, such as Clark's level and Breslow thickness or sun exposure, were associated with cytoplasmic PTEN expressional levels. An association with loss of nuclear PTEN expression was indicated for anatomical site (p = 0.06) and mitotic index (p = 0.02). There was also an association for melanomas to either not express nuclear PTEN or to express p53 alone, rather than both simultaneously (p = 0.02). In contrast with metastatic melanoma, where we have shown previously that almost two-thirds of tumors have some PTEN inactivation, only one-third of primary melanomas had PTEN silencing. This suggests that PTEN inactivation is a late event likely related to melanoma progression rather than initiation. Taken together with our previous observations in thyroid and islet cell tumors, our data suggest that nuclear-cytoplasmic partitioning of PTEN might also play a role in melanoma progression.",

Somewhat paradoxically, E2F-1 also has the properties of a tumor suppressor. Overexpression of E2F-1 has been shown to induce apoptosis in some cancer cells. In the current study, the effect of adenovirus-mediated E2F-1 gene transfer on human melanoma cell growth was investigated.;Two human melanoma cell lines, SK-MEL-28 (wild-type p53) and SK-MEL-2 (mutant p53), were treated by mock infection, infection with a control vector expressing the beta-galactosidase gene (Ad5CMV-LacZ), or infection with a vector expressing E2F-1 (Ad5CMV-E2F-1) at a multiplicity of infection of 100. Cell proliferation and viability were determined by WST-1 assay and trypan blue exclusion, respectively. Apoptosis was assessed by cell flow cytometry and confirmed by cell morphology, in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl nick end labeling assay, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage assay.;Marked overexpression of E2F-1 was evident in both cell lines 24 hours after infection with Ad5CMVE2F-1 by Western blot analysis. E2F-1 overexpression resulted in growth inhibition and rapid loss of cell viability. Overexpression of E2F-1 also resulted in premature S-phase entry and G(2) arrest at 24 hours followed by apoptotic cell death at 48 hours. After Ad5CMVE2F-1 infection, expression of Bax and Bak was unchanged, whereas Mcl-1 levels decreased markedly. In SK-MEL-28 cells, Bcl-XL levels also declined after E2F-1 expression. Bcl-2 was undetectable in SK-MEL-28 cells but was increased in SK-MEL-2 cells in response to E2F-1 overexpression.;Adenovirus-mediated E2F-1 gene transfer efficiently induces widespread apoptosis in human melanoma cells. E2F-1 overexpression induced apoptosis in cell lines containing wild-type and mutant p53, suggesting that this effect does not require wild-type p53 function. Anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, notably Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL, may be involved in mediating the response to E2F-1.

It phosphorylates p53, for example, and induces its nuclear export, HDM2-dependent ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation. GSK-3β can either enhance or inhibit programmed cell death, depending on the nature of the pro-apoptotic stimulus. We previously showed that the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib activated GSK-3β and that this activation attenuated the cytotoxic effects of the drug in various BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines. In this report, we describe the results of studies exploring the effects of GSK-3β on the cytotoxicity and antitumor activity of sorafenib combined with the HDM2 antagonist MI-319.;MI-319 alone increased p53 levels and p53-dependent gene expression in melanoma cells but did not induce programmed cell death. Its cytotoxicity, however, was augmented in some melanoma cell lines by the addition of sorafenib. In responsive cell lines, the MI-319/sorafenib combination induced the disappearance of p53 from the nucleus, the down modulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, the translocation of p53 to the mitochondria and that of AIF to the nuclei. These events were all GSK-3β-dependent in that they were blocked with a GSK-3β shRNA and facilitated in otherwise unresponsive melanoma cell lines by the introduction of a constitutively active form of the kinase (GSK-3β-S9A). These modulatory effects of GSK-3β on the activities of the sorafenib/MI-319 combination were the exact reverse of its effects on the activities of sorafenib alone, which induced the down modulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and the nuclear translocation of AIF only in cells in which GSK-3β activity was either down modulated or constitutively low. In A375 xenografts, the antitumor effects of sorafenib and MI-319 were additive and associated with the down modulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, the nuclear translocation of AIF, and increased suppression of tumor angiogenesis.;Our data demonstrate a complex partnership between GSK-3β and HDM2 in the regulation of p53 function in the nucleus and mitochondria. The data suggest that the ability of sorafenib to activate GSK-3β and alter the intracellular distribution of p53 may be exploitable as an adjunct to agents that prevent the HDM2-dependent degradation of p53 in the treatment of melanoma.",

Using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), human chromosome 17 was consistently identified as the predominant human chromosome in the majority of H7 cells tested between passages 20 and 60. Western blot analysis showed that the hybrid cells expressed human nm23 protein, indicating that at least one gene on the human chromosome 17 was functional.

Sequencing the human p53 gene in A375 C15N and H7 showed mutations in exon 7.

The aims of this study were (a) to compare markers of cell cycle G1-S phase transition in an intraocular tumour with known pRB deficiency (retinoblastoma) and compare it with one with an apparently functional pRB (uveal melanoma); (b) to determine if one of these markers may have a role in the pathogenesis of uveal melanoma; and (c) to determine if there is a difference in cell cycle marker expression following treatment of uveal melanoma and retinoblastoma.;90 eyes were enucleated from 89 patients for retinoblastoma (n = 24) or for choroidal or ciliary body melanoma (n = 66). Conventional paraffin sections were assessed for cell type and degree of differentiation. Additional slides were investigated applying standard immunohistochemical methods with antibodies specific for cyclin D1 protein, pRB, p53, p21, p16, BCL-2, and MIB-1.;Cyclin D1 protein and pRB were negative in retinoblastoma using the applied antibodies. In contrast, cyclin D1 protein expression was observed in 65% of uveal melanomas; a positive correlation between cyclin D1 cell positivity and tumour cell type, location, growth fraction, as well as with pRB positivity was observed. p53, p21, and p16 could be demonstrated in both tumours. An inverse relation between p53 and p21 expression was demonstrated in most choroidal melanomas and in some retinoblastomas. Apart from a decrease in the growth fractions of the tumours as determined by MIB-1, a significant difference in the expression of G1-S phase transition markers in vital areas of uveal melanoma and retinoblastoma following treatment with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy was not observed.;Retinoblastomas and uveal melanomas, two tumours of differing pRB status, differ also in their immunohistochemical pattern for markers of the G1-S phase transition of the cell cycle. The results of the present study support the concept of (a) an autoregulatory loop between pRB and cyclin D1 in tumours with a functional pRB and the disruption of this loop in the presence of pRB mutation, as well as (b) a checkpoint mechanism in late G1, whose regulation via loss of p16 or pRB, or overexpression of cyclin D1 constitutes a common pathway to malignancy. Further, the results raise the possibility of cyclin D1 overexpression having a role in the pathogenesis of uveal melanoma.",

Aberrant cell cycle control impairs DNA repair and increases the probability of mutations that can lead to carcinogenesis. The p53 gene is polymorphic at codon 72 (Arg/Pro) of its protein, which is functionally distinct, leading to inquiry into its role in carcinogenesis. In this hospital-based case-control study of 289 newly diagnosed patients with melanoma and 308 cancer-free control subjects, we evaluated whether the p53 codon 72 variant is associated with risk of cutaneous melanoma (CM). The controls were frequency-matched to the cases by age, sex, and ethnicity. The frequency of the p53 Arg allele was 78.2% in cases and 73.2% in controls (p=0.045), and the genotype frequencies of p53 Arg/Arg, Arg/Pro, and Pro/Pro were 62.6%, 31.1%, and 6.3%, respectively, in the cases, and 53.9%, 38.6%, and 7.5%, respectively, in the controls (p=0.096). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the p53 Arg/Arg genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of melanoma (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.02-2.02) compared with other genotypes, and this association was more evident in subgroups of older subjects (OR=2.32; 95% CI=1.39-388), and subjects with Fitzpatrick's skin type III or IV (OR=1.69; 95% CI=1.11-2.59). In conclusion, this study found some evidence that in subjects over 50, p53 Arg/Arg genotype is associated with increased risk of CM as compared to genotypes Arg/Pro or Pro/Pro. Further larger studies are needed to substantiate our findings.",

Nevertheless, acquired resistance and nonresponders to therapy require different strategies. An innovative approach is presented here that is based on the combination of innate immune system activation and simultaneous targeting of the oncogene urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). We generated two triphosphate-conjugated siRNAs targeting uPAR (ppp-uPAR) by in vitro transcription. Specific uPAR knockdown and simultaneous activation of the retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) was shown in different human melanoma cells, fibroblasts, and melanocytes. The compounds induced massive apoptosis in melanoma cells, whereas fibroblasts and melanocytes were less sensitive. The effects were less pronounced when the IFN receptor was blocked. Treatment with ppp-uPAR led to accumulation of p53 and induction of RIG-I-dependent proapoptotic signaling. The apoptotic effects induced by ppp-uPAR were maintained in melanoma cell lines that had acquired double resistance to B-RAF and MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibition. Systemic intraperitoneal application of ppp-uPAR in nude mice significantly reduced growth of human melanoma xenografts and elicited a systemic innate immune response with increased serum cytokine levels. Our data suggest that ppp-uPAR represents a therapeutically attractive compound that may help overcome the strong therapy resistance of melanoma.",

First-line chemotherapeutics used in melanoma therapy are the methylating agents dacarbazine (DTIC) and temozolomide (TMZ) and the chloroethylating agents BCNU and fotemustine. Here, we determined the mode of cell death in 11 melanoma cell lines upon exposure to TMZ and fotemustine. We show for the first time that TMZ induces apoptosis in melanoma cells, using therapeutic doses. For both TMZ and fotemustine apoptosis is the dominant mode of cell death. The contribution of necrosis to total cell death varied between 10 and 40%. The O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) activity in the cell lines was between 0 and 1100 fmol mg(-1) protein, and there was a correlation between MGMT activity and the level of resistance to TMZ and fotemustine. MGMT inactivation by O(6)-benzylguanine sensitized all melanoma cell lines expressing MGMT to TMZ and fotemustine-induced apoptosis, and MGMT transfection attenuated the apoptotic response. This supports that O(6)-alkylguanines are critical lesions involved in the initiation of programmed melanoma cell death. One of the cell lines (MZ7), derived from a patient subjected to DTIC therapy, exhibited a high level of resistance to TMZ without expressing MGMT. This was related to an impaired expression of MSH2 and MSH6. The cells were not cross-resistant to fotemustine. Although these data indicate that methylating drug resistance of melanoma cells can be acquired by down-regulation of mismatch repair, a correlation between MSH2 and MSH6 expression in the different lines and TMZ sensitivity was not found. Apoptosis in melanoma cells induced by TMZ and fotemustine was accompanied by double-strand break (DSB) formation (as determined by H2AX phosphorylation) and caspase-3 and -7 activation as well as PARP cleavage. For TMZ, DSBs correlated significantly with the apoptotic response, whereas for fotemustine a correlation was not found. Melanoma lines expressing p53 wild-type were more resistant to TMZ and fotemustine than p53 mutant melanoma lines, which is in marked contrast to previous data reported for glioma cells treated with TMZ. Overall, the findings are in line with the model that in melanoma cells TMZ-induced O(6)-methylguanine triggers the apoptotic (and necrotic) pathway through DSBs, whereas for chloroethylating agents apoptosis is triggered in a more complex manner.",

Similarly, immunolabeling for p53 protein has been used to detect mutations in the corresponding gene, as a reflection of possible cellular transformation in the same context. Both of these techniques were applied to 253 melanocytic tumors of the skin to assess their possible utility in the diagnosis and subcategorization of such lesions. They included 76 banal (common) nevi (CN), 39 Spitz nevi (SN), 62 superficial spreading malignant melanomas in radial growth (SSMMs), 32 nodular malignant melanomas (NMMs), 21 lentigo maligna melanomas in radial growth (LMMs), and 23 melanomas arising in association with preexisting compound nevi (MCN). One hundred cells were counted randomly in each tumor, and dark, exclusively nuclear reactivity was scored as positive labeling; results were recorded as percentages. Negligible Ki-67 and p53 labeling was seen in CN and SN, at a level that was similar to that obtained in cases of LMM and MCN. The largest proportion of Ki-67-positive and p53-positive cells was observed in NMMs, followed by SSMMs. Radial growth-phase SSMMs and LMMs demonstrated immunoprofiles that were similar to those of melanocytic nevi, and MCN did so as well. The prototypical malignant melanocytic tumor representing the vertical growth phase-nodular melanoma--demonstrated a statistically significant difference from all other lesions in this study with respect to Ki-67 index (P = .008, chi2) and p53 reactivity (P < .000001, chi2). Subsequent concurrent use of a Ki-67 threshold index of 10% and a p53 index of 5% correctly indicated the presence of vertical growth in 75% of NMMs, whereas only 8% of radial growth phase melanomas of other types were colabeled at the same levels of reactivity for the two markers (P < .00001, chi2). Thus, although the distinction between benign and malignant melanocytic tumors could and should not be based on immunohistology for Ki-67 and p53, these results suggest that the latter determinants may, in fact, be used as an adjunct to morphology in the recognition of the vertical growth phase in cutaneous malignant melanomas.",

Because p53 dysfunction is generally associated with protein overexpression, immunocytochemistry is a valuable technique for the analysis of p53's functional status. We tested the hypothesis that loss of p53 function is a critical event in the early development and progression of human malignant melanoma and can lead to alterations in cell proliferation. We performed an immunocytochemical study in archival fixed, embedded specimens that included 102 melanocytic lesions ranging from benign nevi to metastatic melanoma. In addition to p53, we assessed the p53-associated protein, mdm-2, and markers of cell cycle status (the MIB-1-defined cell proliferation marker; proliferating cell nuclear antigen; and statin, a 57-kDa nuclear protein expressed preferentially by G0 cells). Tumor expression of all nuclear proteins was scored in a semiquantitative fashion related to the fraction of positive tumor nuclei. The overall incidence of significant p53 overexpression was low (8% of primary and 14% of metastatic melanomas). Analysis demonstrated strong correlation between increasing p53 expression in primary versus metastatic lesions (chi 2 analysis, P = 0.001). Correlation was found between increased MIB-1-defined cell proliferation and p53 overexpression in primary melanomas (P = 0.02). Detectable mdm-2 expression was significantly correlated with p53 overexpression (P = 0.02).

Also, there was a correlation between higher Mib-1 index in tumors and strong ezrin expression. All metastatic samples (n=12) showed positive ezrin immunoreactivity.

In human melanoma cell lines and biopsies, we previously identified two novel splicing variants (hMp78 and hMp84) of Calpain-3 gene (CAPN3), which have a significant lower expression in vertical growth phase melanomas and, even lower, in metastases, compared to benign nevi. In the present study, in order to investigate the pathophysiological role played by the longer Calpain-3 variant, hMp84, in melanoma cells, we over-expressed it in A375 and HT-144 cells. In A375 cells, the enforced expression of hMp84 induces p53 stabilization, and modulates the expression of a few p53- and oxidative stress-related genes. Consistently, hMp84 increases the intracellular production of ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species), which lead to oxidative modification of phospholipids (formation of F2-isoprostanes) and DNA damage. Such events culminate in an adverse cell fate, as indicated by the decrease of cell proliferation and by cell death. To a different extent, either the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine or the p53 inhibitor, Pifithrin-α, recover cell viability and decrease ROS formation. Similarly to A375 cells, hMp84 over-expression causes inhibition of cell proliferation, cell death, and increase of both ROS levels and F2-isoprostanes also in HT-144 cells. However, in these cells no p53 accumulation occurs. In both cell lines, no significant change of cell proliferation and cell damage is observed in cells over-expressing the mutant hMp84C42S devoid of its enzymatic activity, suggesting that the catalytic activity of hMp84 is required for its detrimental effects. Since a more aggressive phenotype is expected to benefit from down-regulation of mechanisms impairing cell growth and survival, we envisage that Calpain-3 down-regulation can be regarded as a novel mechanism contributing to melanoma progression.

In this work, we show that increased ERK activation correlates strongly with mutational status of N-RAS or B-RAF in 21 melanoma cell lines. Melanoma lines that were wild-type for RAS/RAF showed low levels of ERK activation comparable with primary human melanocytes. Through supervised analysis of RNA expression profiles, we identified 82 genes, including TWIST1, HIF1alpha, and IL-8, which correlated with ERK activation across the panel of cell lines and which decreased with pharmacologic inhibition of ERK activity, suggesting that they are ERK transcriptional targets in melanoma. Additionally, lines lacking mutations of N-RAS and B-RAF were molecularly distinct and characterized by p53 inactivation, reduced ERK activity, and increased expression of epithelial markers. Analysis of primary human melanomas by tissue microarray confirmed a high correlation among expression of these epithelial markers in a heterogeneous sample of 570 primary human tumors, suggesting that a significant frequency of primary melanomas is of this \"epithelial-like\" subtype.

Overall growth of the Jag2-expressing cultures increased somewhat, and a significant 3-fold increase in clonogenic growth in soft agar was also noted. Introduction of Jag2 increased motility in both wound-healing and transwell invasion assays. We also observed a significant increase in Jag2 and Hes1 mRNA in invasive OMM1 cells that had passed through a Matrigel-coated filter in the transwell assay when compared with noninvading cells.

From a melanoma data base, 12 patients with thick (> 3 mm) stage I nodular melanomas of the skin were identified, who were still without signs of progression after five years of follow-up. These tumours were compared to randomly selected series of 12 cases, who did not survive the first five years after removal of the tumours. We performed immunostaining for the p53-protein and the proliferation associated Ki-67-antigen. For quantification of immunostaining the tumours were entirely scanned. In addition, all tumours were investigated for any differences with conventionally applied prognostic features: the tumour thickness: the level of invasion; the prognostic index (tumour thickness multiplied by mitotic count); and the mean volume-weighted mean nuclear volume. We demonstrated significant differences between survivors and non-survivors exclusively in respect of the staining indices for p53 and Ki-67 (P < 0.03 and 0.02, respectively). With both antibodies the tumours of survivors showed lower counts as compared to non-survivors survivors. However, within both groups we found no significant correlations between the p53- and Ki-67-staining results.

Senescence can be overcome if the pathway is not fully engaged, and this may occur when p16(INK4a) is inactivated. p16(INK4a) is frequently altered in human cancer and germline mutations affecting p16(INK4a) have been linked to melanoma susceptibility. To characterize the functions of melanoma-associated p16(INK4a) mutations, in terms of promoting proliferative arrest and initiating senescence, we utilized an inducible expression system in a melanoma cell model. We show that wild-type p16(INK4a) promotes rapid cell cycle arrest that leads to a senescence programme characterized by the appearance of chromatin foci, activation of acidic beta-galactosidase activity, p53 independence and Rb dependence. Accumulation of wild-type p16(INK4a) also promoted cell enlargement and extensive vacuolization independent of Rb status. In contrast, the highly penetrant p16(INK4a) variants, R24P and A36P failed to arrest cell proliferation and did not initiate senescence. We also show that overexpression of CDK4, or its homologue CDK6, but not the downstream kinase, CDK2, inhibited the ability of wild-type p16(INK4a) to promote cell cycle arrest and senescence. Our data provide the first evidence that p16(INK4a) can initiate a CDK4/6-dependent autonomous senescence programme that is disabled by inherited melanoma-associated mutations.",

In contrast to most human melanomas with an early onset of metastasis, the Grey horse melanomas have an extended period of benign growth, after which 50% or more eventually undergo progression and may metastasize. In efforts to define changes occurring during Grey horse melanoma progression, we established an in vitro model comprised of two cell lines, HoMel-L1 and HoMel-A1, representing a primary and a metastatic stage of the melanoma, respectively. The cell lines were examined for their growth and morphological characteristics, in vitro and in vivo oncogenic potential, chromosome numbers, and expression of melanocytic antigens and tumor suppressors. Both cell lines exhibited malignant characteristics; however, the metastatic HoMel-A1 showed a more aggressive phenotype characterized by higher proliferation rates, invasiveness, and a stronger tumorigenic potential both in vitro and in vivo. HoMel-A1 displayed a near-haploid karyotype, whereas HoMel-L1 was near-diploid. The cell lines expressed melanocytic lineage markers such as TYR, TRP1, MITF, PMEL, ASIP, MC1R, POMC, and KIT. The tumor suppressor p53 was strongly expressed in both cell lines, while the tumor suppressors p16 and PTEN were absent in HoMel-A1, potentially implicating significance of these pathways in the melanoma progression. This in vitro model system will not only aid in understanding of the Grey horse melanoma pathogenesis, but also in unraveling the steps during melanoma progression in general as well as being an invaluable tool for development of new therapeutic strategies.

However, the oncogenic signals that alter membrane homeostasis and their specific contribution to cancer progression remain unclear. Understanding the upstream drivers and downstream regulators of aberrant vesicular trafficking is distinctly important in melanoma. This disease is notorious for its inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Nevertheless, melanomas uniformly overexpress a cluster of endolysosomal genes, being particularly addicted to the membrane traffic regulator RAB7. Still, the underlying mechanisms and temporal determinants of this dependency have yet to be defined. Here we addressed these questions by combining electron microscopy, real time imaging and mechanistic analyses of vesicular trafficking in normal and malignant human melanocytic cells. This strategy revealed Class I PI3K as the key trigger of a hyperactive influx of macropinosomes that melanoma cells counteract via RAB7-mediated lysosomal degradation. In addition, gain- and loss-of-function in vitro studies followed by histopathological validation in clinical biopsies and genetically-engineered mouse models, traced back the requirement of RAB7 to the suppression of premature cellular senescence traits elicited in melanocytes by PI3K-inducing oncogenes. Together, these results provide new insight into the regulators and modes of action of RAB7, broadening the impact of endosomal fitness on melanoma development. ",

Two human melanoma cell lines showing moderate (Mel-RM) and high (IgR3) sensitivity to vincristine were selected from a panel of eight melanoma lines for analysis. Induction of apoptosis was caspase dependent, and was associated with increases in mitochondrial membrane permeability. Vincristine upregulated the expression of Bax, Bak, PUMA, Noxa, p53 and p21 proteins, and downregulated and/or phosphorylated the Bcl-2 protein. Inhibitors of the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, significantly inhibited vincristine-induced apoptosis in both IgR3 and Mel-RM cells. In addition, vincristine induced phosphorylation and reduction in Bcl-2 was prevented by an inhibitor of JNK. Downregulation of mRNA for p53, PUMA or Bim by RNA interference had little or no influence on vincristine-induced apoptosis in IgR3 cells. In addition, silencing Bim mRNA did not affect vincristine-induced apoptosis in Mel-RM cells. These results suggest that vincristine-induced apoptosis of at least some melanoma cell lines is dependent on the activation of JNK. The results are consistent with the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 protein, resulting in the activation of Bax/Bak, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and the resulting activation of caspases.",

The present study aimed to investigate the signaling pathways that mediated GA-induced inhibition of human malignant skin melanoma proliferation.;The study was conducted using A375 cells and the corresponding tumor transplanted in nude mice.;Incubation of A375 cells with 1-10 μg/ml GA decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis. GA concentration-dependently increased p66shc expression and intracellular ROS levels. GA also decreased the oxygen consumption rate and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in A375 cells. Experimental inhibition of p66shc by siRNA suppressed GA-induced increase of ROS, decrease of oxygen consumption rate, MMP and cell viability, whilst suppressing GA-induced increase of apoptosis. GA concentration-dependently upregulated p53 and Bax expression in A375 cells. GA also increased p53-TA-luciferase activity and p53-binding to Bax promoter, which was inhibited by Sip53. Experimental inhibition of p53 with Sip53 blocked GA-induced decrease of the oxygen consumption rate and cell viability, and blocked the increase of apoptosis. In tumor-bearing nude mice, GA notably inhibited tumor growth, and this action was suppressed by N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant, and by PFT-α, a p53 inhibitor. In A375 tumors transplanted in nude mice, GA increased both p66shc and p53 expression. NAC and PFT-α treatment did not significantly affect p66shc expression in tumors grown in mice treated with GA. In contrast, both NAC and PFT-α treatment inhibited GA-induced p53 expression in mouse tumors.;Results provided novel preclinical insights into the chemotherapeutic use of GA by highlighting the importance of p66shc/ROS-p53/Bax pathways in the antitumor effect of GA in malignant melanoma.",

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of targeting either B-Raf or IKKbeta in combination with the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide for treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma. Xenografts of Hs294T human metastatic melanoma cells exhibiting the BRAFV600E mutation were treated with inhibitors of IKKbeta (BMS-345541), B-Raf (BAY 54-9085), and/or temozolomide. Drug response was mechanistically analyzed in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we determined that the antitumor activity of all three drugs depends on inhibition of NF-kappaB. BMS-345541 inhibits IKKbeta-mediated phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and thus blocks the nuclear localization of NF-kappaB, whereas BAY 54-9085 inhibits activation of NF-kappaB through a mechanism that does not involve stabilization of IkappaBalpha. Moreover, BMS-345541, but not BAY 54-9085, activates the death pathways of p53 and c-Jun-NH2-kinase, contributing to the killing of melanoma cells. Temozolomide inhibits both NF-kappaB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity, conferring effective in vivo antitumor activity. Thus, temozolomide, but not BAY 54-9085, has a synergistic in vivo antitumor effect with BMS-345541. We conclude that the efficacy of antimelanoma therapy depends on inhibition of expression of antiapoptotic genes transcriptionally regulated by NF-kappaB. In contrast, drug targeting of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway alone in melanoma cells is ineffective for melanoma therapy in cases where NF-kappaB is not also targeted.",

Following a complete downregulation after birth, ROR1 was shown to re-express in various types of cancers. Little is known about ROR1 expression and function in melanoma. Here we show that ROR1 is aberrantly expressed in both melanoma cell lines and tumors and that its expression associates with poor Post-Recurrence Survival of melanoma. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches we found that ROR1 enhances both anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of melanoma cells. In addition, ROR1 decreases cell adhesion and increases cell motility and migration. Mechanistically, ROR1 was found to induce upregulation of Akt and the mesenquimal markers N-cadherin and vimentin. The regulation of N-cadherin by ROR1 relies on both Akt dependent and independent mechanisms. ROR1 does not affect Wnt canonical pathway but was found to be engaged in a positive feedback loop with Wnt5a. In summary, we show that ROR1 contributes to melanoma progression and is a candidate biomarker of poor prognosis. Although further studies are needed to confirm this possibility, the present work indicates that ROR1 is a good prospective target for melanoma cancer therapy. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Epigenetic regulators have emerged as critical factors governing the biology of cancer. Here, in the context of melanoma, we show that RNF2 is prognostic, exhibiting progression-correlated expression in human melanocytic neoplasms. Through a series of complementary gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies in mouse and human systems, we establish that RNF2 is oncogenic and prometastatic. Mechanistically, RNF2-mediated invasive behavior is dependent on its ability to monoubiquitinate H2AK119 at the promoter of LTBP2, resulting in silencing of this negative regulator of TGFβ signaling. In contrast, RNF2's oncogenic activity does not require its catalytic activity nor does it derive from its canonical gene repression function. Instead, RNF2 drives proliferation through direct transcriptional upregulation of the cell-cycle regulator CCND2. We further show that MEK1-mediated phosphorylation of RNF2 promotes recruitment of activating histone modifiers UTX and p300 to a subset of poised promoters, which activates gene expression. In summary, RNF2 regulates distinct biologic processes in the genesis and progression of melanoma via different molecular mechanisms.;The role of epigenetic regulators in cancer progression is being increasingly appreciated. We show novel roles for RNF2 in melanoma tumorigenesis and metastasis, albeit via different mechanisms. Our findings support the notion that epigenetic regulators, such as RNF2, directly and functionally control powerful gene networks that are vital in multiple cancer processes.",

Human malignant melanoma serves as an example for progressive growth factor independence at subsequent stages of tumor progression. Mechanisms by which malignant cells acquire growth factor independence are discussed. In melanoma, deregulation of growth regulatory pathways has been described on four levels: 1) aberrant production of autocrine growth factors that substitute for exogenous growth factors (basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF]); 2) alterations in the response to negative autocrine growth factors (interleukin [IL]-6 and transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta); 3) overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGF-R); and 4) alterations of cellular protooncogenes involved in signal transduction (RAS, MYB) and growth suppression (p53). In addition to bFGF and IL-6, multiple other growth factor genes are activated in malignant melanoma cells but not normal melanocytes. These include both chains of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), TGF-alpha, IL-1, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Of these, PDGF-B has been investigated in more detail. Melanoma-derived PDGF clearly does not act in a direct autocrine mode, but has important paracrine effects on normal tissue constituents, notably fibroblasts and endothelial cells, that are essential for tumor development in vivo. It is speculated that other melanoma-derived growth factors with as yet undefined functions similarly exert such paracrine or 'indirect' autocrine effects that cannot be sufficiently addressed in studies on cultured cells.",

This report shows that U0126 inhibits early response (ERK) kinase activation and cyclin A expression in wt p53 C8161 melanoma exposed to either UV radiation or betulinic acid. However, U0126 does not protect from UV damage, but counteracts betulinic acid-mediated apoptosis in the same cells. Protection from the latter drug by joint treatment with U0126 was also evident in wt p53 MelJuso melanoma and mutant p53 WM164 melanoma. The latter cells were the most responsive to betulinic acid, showing a selective decline in the cdk4 protein, without a comparable change in other key cell cycle proteins like cdc2, cdk2, cdk7 or cyclin A, prior to apoptosis-associated PARP fragmentation. Laser scanning cytometry also showed that betulinic acid induced a significant increase in chromatin condensation in WM164 melanoma irrespective of whether they were in adherent form or as multicellular spheroids. All these betulinic acid-induced changes were counteracted by U0126. Our data show for the first time that (a) cdk4 protein is an early target of betulinic acid-induced apoptosis and (b) unrestricted ERK signaling favours betulinic acid-induced apoptosis, but this is counteracted by U0126, partly through counteracting chromatin condensation and restoring Akt activation decreased by betulinic acid treatment.",

There is a consensus that skin cancer is initiated by sunlight exposure. For non-melanoma skin cancer there is substantial evidence that chronic exposure to the ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) (280-320 nm) portion of the sunlight spectrum is responsible. Experimentally, UVB is mutagenic and chronic UVB exposure can cause non-melanoma skin cancer in laboratory animals. Non-melanoma tumors in animals and in humans show characteristic UVB signature lesions in the tumor suppressor p53 and/or in the patched (PTCH) gene. An action spectrum or wavelength dependence for squamous cell carcinoma in the mouse shows a major peak of efficacy in the UVB. For malignant melanoma, however, the situation is unclear and the critical direct target(s) of sunlight in initiating melanoma and even the wavelengths responsible are as yet unidentified. This lack of information is in major part a result of a paucity of animal models for melanoma which recapitulate the role of sunlight in initiating this disease. The epidemiology of melanoma differs significantly from non-melanoma skin cancer. Intense sporadic sunlight exposure in childhood, probably exacerbated by additional adult exposure, is associated with elevated melanoma risk. Melanoma is also a disease of gene-environment interactions with underlying genetic factors playing a significant role. These major differences indicate that extrapolation from information for non-melanoma skin cancer to melanoma is unlikely to be useful. We summarize in this review the experimental information available on the role of UV radiation in melanoma and give an overview of animal melanoma models. A new model derived by neonatal UV irradiation of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) transgenic mice is described which recapitulates the etiology, the histopathology and molecular pathogenesis of human disease. It is anticipated that the HGF/SF transgenic model will provide a means to access the mechanism(s) by which sunlight initiates this lethal disease and provide an appropriate vehicle for derivation of appropriate therapeutic and preventive strategies.",

Pharmacological concentration of arsenic in combination with a widely known oxidant, menadione was explored in this study to synergistically sensitize malignant melanoma cells to apoptosis. The molecular mechanism of apoptosis and the signaling-pathways involved were thoroughly investigated. MATERIALS METHODS AND RESULTS: Menadione synergized NaAsO(2) to significantly increase ROS generation and facilitate the major apoptotic signaling events: alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 down-regulation and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 followed by poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 cleavage. Antioxidant N-acetyl-L: -cysteine antagonized these events. Investigation of the signaling-pathway revealed significant suppression of AP-1 activity but not NF-kappaB upon NaAsO(2) and menadione application. An increase in p38 phosphorylation and p53 protein expression did also dictate the apoptotic response. Suppression of p38 activation with SB203580 and inhibition of p53 expression by siRNA attenuated apoptosis. Transfection of p53, in p53 null HCT cells augmented the apoptotic events. Moreover, the treatment also led to tumor size reduction in BALB/c mice developed by intra-dermal B16 mouse melanoma cell injection; however, it had no detectable pro-proliferative or pro-apoptotic effect on non-tumor keratinocytes, normal fibroblasts or PBMC.;This study thus provides an insight into innovative mechanisms of melanoma sensitization, a proper cure against which is still elusive.

To date, pathway interference downstream of mutant NRAS seems to be the most promising approach. In this study, data revealed that mutant NRAS induced Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) expression, and pharmacologic inhibition of Plk1 stabilized the size of NRAS mutant melanoma xenografts. The combination of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and Plk1 inhibitors resulted in a significant growth reduction of NRAS mutant melanoma cells in vitro, and regression of xenografted NRAS mutant melanoma in vivo. Independent cell cycle arrest and increased induction of apoptosis underlies the synergistic effect of this combination. Data further suggest that the p53 signaling pathway is of key importance to the observed therapeutic efficacy. This study provides in vitro, in vivo, and first mechanistic data that an MEK/Plk1 inhibitor combination might be a promising treatment approach for patients with NRAS-driven melanoma.

        "Doc_abstract":"In this study, we investigated the molecular pathways targeted by curcumin during apoptosis of human melanoma cell lines. We found that curcumin caused cell death in eight melanoma cell lines, four with wild-type and four with mutant p53. We demonstrate that curcumin-induced apoptosis is both dose- and time-dependent. We found that curcumin did not induce p53, suggesting that curcumin activates other apoptosis pathways. Our data show that curcumin activates caspases-3 and -8 but not caspase-9, supporting the rationale that apoptosis occurs via a membrane-mediated mechanism. Both a caspase-8 and broad-based caspase inhibitor, but not a caspase-9 specific inhibitor, suppressed curcumin-induced cell death. To further support our hypothesis that curcumin induces activation of a death receptor pathway, we show that curcumin induces Fas receptor aggregation in a FasL-independent manner and that low-temperature incubation, previously shown to inhibit receptor aggregation, prevented curcumin-induced cell death. Moreover, we demonstrate that expression of dominant negative FADD significantly inhibited curcumin-induced cell death. In addition, our results indicate that curcumin also blocks the NF-kappaB cell survival pathway and suppresses the apoptotic inhibitor, XIAP. Since melanoma cells with mutant p53 are strongly resistant to conventional chemotherapy, curcumin may overcome the chemoresistance of these cells and provide potential new avenues for treatment.",

The NimbleGen Human CGH Whole-Genome Tiling array was used to define CNAs, and the Illumina GoldenGate Methylation platform was applied to characterise the methylation patterns of overlapping genes.;WE IDENTIFIED TWO SUBCLASSES OF PRIMARY MELANOMA: one representing patients with better prognoses and the other being characteristic of patients with unfavourable outcomes. We assigned 1,080 genes as being significantly correlated with ulceration, 987 genes were downregulated and significantly enriched in the p53, Nf-kappaB, and WNT/beta-catenin pathways. Through integrated genome analysis, we defined 150 downregulated genes whose expression correlated with copy number losses in ulcerated samples. These genes were significantly enriched on chromosome 6q and 10q, which contained a total of 36 genes. Ten of these genes were downregulated and involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion or apoptosis. The expression and methylation patterns of additional genes exhibited an inverse correlation, suggesting that transcriptional silencing of these genes is driven by epigenetic events.;Using an integrative genomic approach, we were able to identify functionally relevant molecular hotspots characterised by copy number losses and promoter hypermethylation in distinct molecular subtypes of melanoma that contribute to specific transcriptomic silencing and might indicate a poor clinical outcome of melanoma.",

Utilizing a loss-of-function experimental setting in a vast collection of genetically varied melanoma cell lines, we observed the requirement of RanBP3 in melanoma cell proliferation and survival. Mechanistically, we suggest the reinstatement of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-Smad2/3-p21(Cip1) tumor-suppressor axis as part of the RanBP3 silencing-associated antiproliferative program. Employing extensive nuclear export sequence analyses and immunofluorescence-based protein localization studies, we further present evidence suggesting the requirement of RanBP3 function for the nuclear exit of the weak nuclear export sequence-harboring extracellular signal-regulated kinase protein, although it is dispensable for general CRM1-mediated nuclear export of strong nuclear export sequence-harboring cargoes.

A gene expression profile analysis of D6-treated melanoma cells and fibroblasts was then carried out on high density microarrays, to assess gene expression changes induced by this compound. The expression profile study evidenced both an induction of stress response pathways and a modulation of cell growth regulation mechanisms. In particular, our data suggest that the antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities of D6 in melanoma could be partially driven by up-regulation of the p53 signalling pathways as well as by down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt and NF-kB pathways. Modulation of gene expression due to D6 treatment was verified by western blot analysis for single proteins of interest, confirming the results from the gene expression profile analysis.;Our findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of action of D6, through a comprehensive description of the molecular changes induced by this compound at the gene expression level, in agreement with the previously reported anti-tumour effects on melanoma cells.",

It was shown that TSA treatment led to a transient G(2)/M phase delay and accumulation of unphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRB) in all cases. TSA significantly induced protein expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1) in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines including those not expressing p21(WAF1/CIP1) constitutively, whereas the levels of both wild-type and mutated p53 protein were reduced. The effect on p53 was not a direct result of inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) activation by TSA, as treatment of the cells with the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-1 (MEK1) inhibitor PD98059 did not result in decreased p53 protein level. Furthermore, TSA treatment led to reduction in cyclin D1 whereas cyclin D3 accumulated, the latter due to increased protein stability. Similarly, cyclin A protein was reduced whereas cyclin E level was elevated. The effect on p27(Kip1), CDK4 and CDK2 was only marginal. In all the examined cell lines, TSA treatment resulted in a profound induction of apoptosis and cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) indicative of caspase activity. Similarly, TSA-mediated apoptosis was reversed by the caspase-inhibitor z-vad-fmk. Altogether, these results suggest that p21(WAF1/CIP1) in melanomas is silenced by deacetylation, and furthermore that inhibition of deacetylation may have potential in anticancer therapy of melanoma patients.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The treatment of melanoma has been revolutionized over the past decade with the development of effective molecular and immune targeted therapies. The great majority of patients with melanoma have mutations in oncogenes that predominantly drive signaling through the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Analytic tools have been developed that can effectively stratify patients into molecular subsets based on the identification of mutations in oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes that drive the MAPK pathway. At the same time, potent and selective inhibitors of mediators of the MAPK pathway such as RAF, MEK, and ERK have become available. The most dramatic example is the development of single-agent inhibitors of BRAF (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib) and MEK (trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib) for patients with metastatic BRAFV600-mutant melanoma, a subset that represents 40% to 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma. More recently, the elucidation of mechanisms underlying resistance to single-agent BRAF inhibitor therapy led to a second generation of trials that demonstrated the superiority of BRAF inhibitor/MEK inhibitor combinations (dabrafenib/trametinib; vemurafenib/cobimetinib) compared to single-agent BRAF inhibitors. Moving beyond BRAFV600 targeting, a number of other molecular subsets--such as mutations in MEK, NRAS, and non-V600 BRAF and loss of function of the tumor suppressor neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1)--are predicted to respond to MAPK pathway targeting by single-agent pan-RAF, MEK, or ERK inhibitors. As these strategies are being tested in clinical trials, preclinical and early clinical trial data are now emerging about which combinatorial approaches might be best for these patients.",

In this study, we investigated the anti-melanoma and anti-angiogenic activity of SKLB-M8 on three melanoma cell lines (A2058, CHL-1, and B16F10) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In vitro, SKLB-M8 showed anti-proliferative activity with IC50 values of 0.07, 0.25, and 0.88 μM in A2058, CHL-1, and B16F10 cell lines, respectively. Flow cytometory analysis showed that SKLB-M8 induced G2/M arrest in three melanoma cell lines, and western blotting demonstrated that SKLB-M8 down-regulated the expression of cdc2, up-regulated p53 in A2058 and CHL-1 cells, and triggered cell apoptosis through down-regulating AKT and phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR). SKLB-M8 also inhibited HUVEC proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation in vitro with the inhibition of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2). In vivo, alginate-encapsulated tumor cell assay revealed that SKLB-M8 suppressed B16F10 tumor angiogenesis. In CHL-1- and B16F10-tumor-bearing mouse models, SKLB-M8 inhibited tumor growth by oral treatment with less toxicity. CD31 immunofluoresence staining and caspase-3 immunohistochemistry indicated that SKLB-M8 inhibited melanoma tumor growth by targeting angiogenesis and inducing caspase3-dependent apoptosis.

However, more reliable prognostic markers are needed that allow a better stratification of patients, especially with regard to therapeutic options. Here, a retrospective study was performed on patients with primary superficial-spreading melanoma (SSM, n=44) or nodular melanoma (n=16) of 1.5-4 mm thickness. Thirty patients had survived the follow-up of 10 years, whereas the other 30 patients developed metastases. Tumor sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of regulators of the cell cycle (p21; retinoblastoma protein (pRb)), of the intrinsic or extrinsic proapoptotic pathways (p53; murine double minute gene 2 protein; tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-R1/DR4; TRAIL-R2/DR5) and of Bcl-2-related proteins (Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bax, Bak, Bok), which regulate the common mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In SSM, decrease of Bax and Bak was significantly correlated with a poor prognosis: high Bax was associated with 10-year survival rates of 68%, whereas low Bax resulted in only 26% survival, and high Bak was associated with 10-year survival rates of 62%, whereas low Bak resulted in only 10% survival.

We found a significant elevation of Plk1 immunostaining in melanoma tissues. Further, a second generation small molecule Plk1 inhibitor, BI 6727, resulted in reductions in growth, viability and clonogenic survival, as well as an increase in apoptosis of A375 and Hs 294T melanoma cells. BI 6727 treatment also resulted in a G2/M-as well as S-phase cell cycle arrest in melanoma cells. Importantly, BI 6727 (intravenous injection; 10 and 25 mg/kg body weight) treatment resulted in significant tumor growth delay and regression in vivo in A375-and Hs 294T-implanted xenografts in athymic nude mice. These anti-melanoma effects were accompanied with a decreased cellular proliferation (Ki-67 staining) and induction of apoptosis (caspase 3 activation). In addition, BI 6727 treatment caused a marked induction of p53 and p21 in vitro as well as in vivo.

The development of innovative therapies with improved efficacy is critical to treatment of this disease. Here, we show that aberrant expression of two proteins, p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), is associated with poor patient survival. Using tissue microarray analysis, we found that patients exhibiting both weak PUMA expression and strong p-Akt expression in their melanoma tumor tissue had significantly worse 5-year survival than patients with either weak PUMA or strong p-Akt expression alone (P < 0.001). Strikingly, no patients exhibiting strong PUMA expression and weak p-Akt expression in primary tumor tissue died within 5 years of diagnosis. We propose a two-pronged therapeutic strategy of (a) boosting PUMA expression and (b) inhibiting Akt phosphorylation in melanoma tumor tissue. Here, we report that a recombinant adenovirus containing human PUMA cDNA (ad-PUMA) efficiently inhibits human melanoma cell survival in vitro, rapidly induces apoptosis, and dramatically suppresses human melanoma tumor growth in a severe combined immunodeficient mouse xenograft model. In melanoma cells strongly expressing p-Akt, we show that Akt/protein kinase B signaling inhibitor-2 (API-2; a small-molecule Akt inhibitor) reduces cell survival in a dose- and time-dependent manner and enhances ad-PUMA-mediated growth inhibition of melanoma cells. Finally, we show that, by combining ad-PUMA and API-2 treatments, human melanoma tumor growth can be inhibited by >80% in vivo compared with controls. Our results suggest that a strategy to correct dysregulated PUMA and p-Akt expression in malignant melanoma may be an effective therapeutic option.",

To investigate the role of p16 in melanocytes, we assessed aspects of growth, apoptosis, and immortalization in melanocytes cultured from two melanoma patients, both of whom had two inactive p16 alleles but functional ARF.;Growth and senescence were evaluated by cumulative population-doubling curves, and apoptosis by terminal deoxytransferase labeling. Expression of p53 and p21, which are associated with fibroblast senescence, was assessed by immunoblotting. Amphotropic retroviruses were used to transfer exogenous gene sequences into the melanocytes.;Both melanocyte cultures showed high rates of apoptosis, which were reduced when the cells were grown in the presence of keratinocyte feeder cells or human stem cell factor plus endothelin 1. With these growth factors, both cultures proliferated for 45-55 net population doublings, markedly longer than the maximum of 10 net population doublings of normal adult human melanocytes in similar media, indicating impaired senescence. One of the cultures developed chromosomal aberrations, with numerous dicentric chromosomes at senescence, consistent with telomere dysfunction. p53 and p21 levels were not elevated in senescent normal melanocytes but were elevated in senescent p16-deficient melanocytes. Interference with p53 function by transfer of human papillomavirus 16-E6 further extended the lifespan of p16-deficient melanocytes. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase was sufficient to immortalize both these cell strains but not normal melanocytes.;Normal senescence in human melanocytes requires p16 activity. p53 contributes to a delayed form of senescence that requires telomere shortening, in p16-deficient melanocytes.

Here, we show that FOXD3 levels are upregulated following attenuation of B-RAF and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) signaling in mutant B-RAF harboring human melanoma cells. This effect was selective because FOXD3 was not upregulated following MEK inhibition in wild-type B-RAF melanoma cells and mutant B-RAF thyroid carcinoma cells. Ectopic FOXD3 expression potently inhibited melanoma cell growth without altering mutant B-RAF activation of ERK1/2. Inhibition of cell growth was due to a potent G(1) cell cycle arrest and was associated with p53-dependent upregulation of p21(Cip1). FOXD3-induced cell cycle arrest was prevented by p53 depletion and, to a lesser extent, p21(Cip1) depletion.

In the present study, we show that up-regulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 is another mechanism critical for protection of melanoma cells against ER stress-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of Mcl-1 by small interference RNA (siRNA) rendered melanoma cells sensitive to apoptosis induced by the ER stress inducers thapsigargin and tunicamycin, but this sensitization was partially reversed by siRNA knockdown of PUMA or Noxa, as shown in Mcl-1-deficient melanoma cells. Both PUMA and Noxa were increased by ER stress through transcriptional up-regulation, but only up-regulation of Noxa was dependent on p53, whereas up-regulation of PUMA seemed to be mediated by a p53-independent mechanism(s). Up-regulation of Mcl-1 was also due to increased transcription that involved the IRE1alpha and activating transcription factor 6 signaling pathways of the unfolded protein response. In addition, activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway seemed to be necessary for optimal up-regulation of Mcl-1. Taken together, these results reveal the mechanisms of resistance of melanoma cells to apoptosis induction mediated by BH3-only proteins upon ER stress, and identify Mcl-1 as a target for the treatment of melanoma in combination with therapeutics that induce ER stress.",

From the age of 17, a verrucous nevoid melanoma consisting of lymphoblast-like large nevoid cells, which were positive for HMB-45 and had a high Ki-67 index up to 18.7%, gradually increased in size. The melanoma cells vertically invaded the dermis to a depth of 3 mm and radially spread in the papillary dermis. Twelve years after undergoing a wide local resection and additional chemotherapy, metastatic lesions were found in the lung and the anterior mediastinum, which gradually increased in size and caused death a few months later. Metastatic melanoma cells were positive for HMB-45 and had a high Ki-67 index up to 33.7%. Most metastatic melanoma cells were positive for p53 while the primary ones were negative. Deteriorating mutations probably accumulated during the latent period.",

Our previous study showed that AT-II can inhibit B16 cells proliferation. Here we investigate the mechanistic basis for the anti-proliferative activity of AT-II in B16 melanoma cells.;Cell viability was examined by MTT assay. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry. Protein expression was determined by Western blotting.;AT-II treatment for 48 h dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation with an IC(50) of 82.3 μM, and induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Moreover, treatment with 75 μM AT-II induced apoptosis. These observations were associated with the decrease of the expression of Cdk2, phosphorylated-Akt, phosphorylated-ERK and Bcl-2, the increase of the expression of phosphorylated-p38, phosphorylated-p53, p21, p27, and activation of caspases-8, -9 and -3. In addition, a chemical inhibitor of p53, PFTα, significantly decreased AT-II-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis.;We demonstrated that the G1-arresting and apoptotic effects of AT-II in B16 cells involve p38 activation as well as ERK and Akt inactivation, and the cytotoxic/apoptotic effects of AT-II are potentially p53 dependent. These findings provided chemical and pharmacological basis for the traditional application of Baizhu in melanoma treatment.",

Loss of expression of the p16INK4 tumor suppressor protein, the product of the CDKN2 gene, has been associated with a wide variety of human malignancies. Mutations, loss of heterozygosity and deletions of the CDKN2 locus have been reported in sporadic and familial cutaneous malignant melanomas (CMM). To investigate the role of the alterations of p16 expression in melanoma, we evaluated by immunohistochemistry the p16 expression and cell proliferation in 79 primary CMM and 10 benign melanocytic nevi (BMN). Forty-six melanomas (58%) and all BMN were found to be p16 positive; 33 melanomas (42%) were considered p16 negative. The extent of invasion according to Clark was significantly higher in p16-negative tumors than in p16-positive tumors. Cell proliferation as expressed by the proportion of positive cells in Ki-67 immunostaining was found to be significantly higher in p16-negative tumors than in p16-positive tumors, although there was no significant difference in the mitotic index between p16-positive and p16-negative tumors. In p16-positive tumors, the number of Ki-67-positive cells correlated with the mitotic index; in p16-negative tumors, there was no correlation between these parameters. Our data suggest that loss of p16 expression is more common in advanced melanomas, and that G1/S checkpoint regulation is disrupted in p16-negative melanomas. Our results show that loss of p16 expression is a common event in primary melanomas, which further substantiates the role of p16 as a major tumor suppressor.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Recent research suggests that altered redox control of melanoma cell survival, proliferation, and invasiveness represents a chemical vulnerability that can be targeted by pharmacological modulation of cellular oxidative stress. The endoperoxide artemisinin and semisynthetic artemisinin-derivatives including dihydroartemisinin (DHA) constitute a major class of antimalarials that kill plasmodium parasites through induction of iron-dependent oxidative stress. Here, we demonstrate that DHA may serve as a redox chemotherapeutic that selectively induces melanoma cell apoptosis without compromising viability of primary human melanocytes. Cultured human metastatic melanoma cells (A375, G361, LOX) were sensitive to DHA-induced apoptosis with upregulation of cellular oxidative stress, phosphatidylserine externalization, and activational cleavage of procaspase 3. Expression array analysis revealed DHA-induced upregulation of oxidative and genotoxic stress response genes (GADD45A, GADD153, CDKN1A, PMAIP1, HMOX1, EGR1) in A375 cells. DHA exposure caused early upregulation of the BH3-only protein NOXA, a proapototic member of the Bcl2 family encoded by PMAIP1, and genetic antagonism (siRNA targeting PMAIP1) rescued melanoma cells from apoptosis indicating a causative role of NOXA-upregulation in DHA-induced melanoma cell death. Comet analysis revealed early DHA-induction of genotoxic stress accompanied by p53 activational phosphorylation (Ser 15). In primary human epidermal melanocytes, viability was not compromised by DHA, and oxidative stress, comet tail moment, and PMAIP1 (NOXA) expression remained unaltered. Taken together, these data demonstrate that metastatic melanoma cells display a specific vulnerability to DHA-induced NOXA-dependent apoptosis and suggest feasibility of future anti-melanoma intervention using artemisinin-derived clinical redox antimalarials.",

The inhibition of osteoclasts' growth has been suggested as the main mechanism of the inhibitory effect of pamidronate on bone metastases. Recent findings indicated that bisphosphonates also have a direct apoptotic effect on other types of tumour cells. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates were shown to inhibit farnesyl diphosphate synthase, thus blocking the synthesis of higher isoprenoids. By this mechanism they inactivate monomeric G-proteins of the Ras and Rho families for which prenylation is a functional requirement. On the background of the known key role of G-proteins in tumorigenesis, we investigated a possible beneficial use of pamidronate in the treatment of malignant melanoma. Our results indicate that pamidronate inhibits the cell growth and induces apoptosis in human melanoma cells in vitro. Susceptibility to pamidronate did not correlate to CD95 ligand sensitivity or p53 mutational status. Furthermore it is interesting to note that overexpression of bcl-2 did not abolish pamidronate-induced apoptosis.

We have investigated the growth-inhibitory properties of this compound alone and in combination with ionizing radiation in a panel of established human melanoma cell lines as well as in normal human melanocytes. Betulinic acid strongly and consistently suppressed the growth and colony-forming ability of all human melanoma cell lines investigated. In combination with ionizing radiation the effect of betulinic acid on growth inhibition was additive in colony-forming assays. Betulinic acid also induced apoptosis in human melanoma cells as demonstrated by Annexin V binding and by the emergence of cells with apoptotic morphology. The growth-inhibitory action of betulinic acid was more pronounced in human melanoma cell lines than in normal human melanocytes. Notably, despite the induction of apoptosis, analysis of the expression of Bcl-2 family members in betulinic-acid-treated cells revealed that expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 was induced. Furthermore, the antiproliferative action of betulinic acid seemed to be independent of the p53 status. The properties of betulinic acid make it an interesting candidate, not only as a single agent but also in combination with radiotherapy.

We have previously shown that gadd45 expression is strongly enhanced in a p53-independent manner following UVB irradiation, unlike the other p53 target genes studied. Furthermore, gadd45 is specifically activated in melanocytes since its induction in response to UVB, is not observed in other skin cells such as keratinocytes or fibroblasts. To investigate this particular regulation of gadd45, we analysed the UVB-induced response of different gadd45 promoter regions. Thus, a minimal promoter region of 50 bp length, responsible for gadd45 activation in melanoma cell lines following UVB irradiation, was determined. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), we showed that this region (-106/-56) of the gadd45 promoter which contains two identical octamers, binds the POU family gene products oct-1 and N-oct3. Given the specific expression pattern of N-oct3 in melanocyte, we invalidated the expression of this transcription factor in melanoma cells: such an abrogation of N-oct3 protein expression in melanoma cells impeded gadd45 UVB-response.

Despite many advances in cancer treatment over the last several decades, the prognosis for patients with advanced melanoma remains poor. New treatment methods and strategies are necessary. The main hallmark of cancer is uncontrolled cellular proliferation with alterations in the expression of proteins. Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-related proteins posttranslationally modify proteins and thereby alter their functions. The ubiquitination process is involved in various physiological responses, including cell growth, cell death, and DNA damage repair. E3 ligases, the most specific enzymes of ubiquitination system, participate in the turnover of many key regulatory proteins and in the development of cancer. E3 ligases are of interest as drug targets for their ability to regulate proteins stability and functions. Compared to the general proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, which blocks the entire protein degradation, drugs that target a particular E3 ligase are expected to have better selectivity with less associated toxicity. Components of different E3 ligases complexes (FBW7, MDM2, RBX1/ROC1, RBX2/ROC2, cullins and many others) are known as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in melanomagenesis. These proteins participate in regulation of different cellular pathways and such important proteins in cancer development as p53 and Notch. In this review we summarized published data on the role of known E3 ligases in the development of melanoma and discuss the inhibitors of E3 ligases as a novel approach for the treatment of malignant melanomas.

Previously, we have demonstrated that SFN inhibits the metastasis of B16F-10 melanoma cells in both in vivo and in vitro models. Melanomas are among the aggressive tumor types because of their notorious resistance to treatment and their high tendency to metastasize. In this study, we investigated the influence of SFN on the induction of apoptosis in B16F-10 melanoma cells, which was evidenced by morphological changes such as membrane blebbing, presence of apoptotic bodies, DNA condensation, and also by nuclear DNA fragmentation. SFN-induced apoptosis was associated with the activation of caspases 3 and 9, Bax, and p53 and the downregulation of Bcl-2, caspase-8, Bid, and NF-kB. Caspase-3 is a most likely candidate to mediate SFN-induced apoptosis. In addition to the caspase-dependent pathway, our results also showed the involvement of proinflammatory cytokines, namely tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-12p40, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and the nuclear translocation of factors kappa B (NF-κB) p65, NF-κB p50, NF-κB c-Rel, c-FOS, ATF-2, and CREB-1 in SFN-induced apoptosis.

After appropriate specimen and nucleic acid quality control, 80 NGS libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSight tumor (TST) kit and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq. Sequence alignment, variant calling, and sequencing quality control were performed using vendor software and laboratory-developed analysis workflows. TST generated ≥500× coverage for 98.4% of the 13,952 targeted bases. Reproducible and accurate variant calling was achieved at ≥5% variant allele frequency with 8 to 12 multiplexed samples per MiSeq flow cell. TST detected 112 variants overall, and confirmed all known single-nucleotide variants (n = 27), deletions (n = 5), insertions (n = 3), and multinucleotide variants (n = 3). TST detected at least one variant in 85.0% (68/80), and two or more variants in 36.2% (29/80), of samples. TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene in NSCLC (13 variants; 13/32 samples), gastrointestinal malignancies (15 variants; 13/25 samples), and overall (30 variants; 28/80 samples). BRAF mutations were most common in melanoma (nine variants; 9/23 samples).

T-oligo is proposed to function in a manner similar to experimental disruption of the telomere overhang and induces DNA damage responses including apoptosis, differentiation and senescence. However, important components involved in T-oligo induced responses are not defined, particularly the role of p53, TRF1 and TRF2 in mediating the T-oligo induced responses. In MU, PM-WK, and MM-MC melanoma cells, exposure to T-oligo upregulates p53 expression and phosphorylation, resulting in cellular differentiation and activation of a caspase-mediated apoptotic cascade. However, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p53 completely blocks T-oligo induced differentiation and significantly decreases apoptosis, suggesting that p53 is an important mediator of T-oligo induced responses. In addition, we characterized the roles of telomere binding proteins, TRF1, TRF2, and tankyrase-1, in T-oligo induced damage responses. We demonstrate that tankyrase-1 activity is required for initiation of T-oligo induced damage responses including p53 phosphorylation and reduction of cellular proliferation. These results highlight TRF1, TRF2, tankyrase-1 and p53 as important elements in T-oligo mediated responses and suggest new avenues for research into T-oligo's mechanism of action. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Defective cytochrome c release and the resulting loss of caspase-3 activation was recently shown to be essential for the susceptibility of human melanoma cells to CD95/Fas-induced apoptosis. Cytochrome c release from mitochondria is regulated by the relative amounts of apoptosis-promoting and apoptosis-inhibiting Bcl-2 proteins in the outer membrane of these organelles. The assignment of Bax/Bcl-2 ratios by quantitative Western blotting in 11 melanoma cell populations revealed a relation to the susceptibility to CD95-mediated apoptosis. We could show that a low Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was characteristic for resistant cells and a high Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was characteristic for sensitive cells. Low Bax expression was not a consequence of mutations in the p53 coding sequence. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was also in clear correlation with sensitivity to another cell death inducer, N-acetylsphingosine. Furthermore, Bcl-2 overexpression abolished apoptosis triggered by both apoptotic stimuli, confirming the critical role of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio as a rheostat that determines the susceptibility to apoptosis in melanoma cells by regulating mitochondrial function. Interestingly, some chemotherapeutics lead to the activation of death pathways by CD95L upregulation, ceramide generation, direct activation of upstream caspases, or upregulation of proapoptotic genes. Taken together, these signals enter the apoptotic pathway upstream of mitochondria, resulting in activation of this central checkpoint. We therefore assumed that apoptosis deficiency of malignant melanoma can be circumvented by drugs directly influencing mitochondrial functions. For this purpose we used betulinic acid, a cytotoxic agent selective for melanoma, straightly perturbing mitochondrial functions. In fact, betulinic acid induced mitochondrial cytochrome c release and DNA fragmentation in both CD95-resistant and CD95-sensitive melanoma cell populations, independent of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.",

This study demonstrates that it has anti-tumour potential. Climacostol caused a reduction of viability/proliferation of B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells, a rapidly occurring DNA damage, and induced the intrinsic apoptotic pathway characterised by the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria, the release of Cytochrome c from the mitochondria, and the activation of Caspase 9-dependent cleavage of Caspase 3. The apoptotic mechanism of climacostol was found to rely on the up-regulation of p53 and its targets Noxa and Puma. In vivo analysis of B16-F10 allografts revealed a persistent inhibition of tumour growth rate when melanomas were treated with intra-tumoural injections of climacostol. In addition, it significantly improved the survival of transplanted mice, decreased tumour weight, induced a remarkable reduction of viable cells inside the tumour, activated apoptosis and up-regulated the p53 signalling network. Importantly, climacostol toxicity was more selective against tumour than non-tumour cells. The anti-tumour properties of climacostol and the molecular events associated with its action indicate that it is a powerful agent that may be considered for the design of pro-apoptotic drugs for melanoma therapy.

We investigated this by assessing the contribution of rare variants in genes involved in CMM to PD risk. We studied rare variation across 29 CMM risk genes using high-quality genotype data in 6875 PD cases and 6065 controls and sought to replicate findings using whole-exome sequencing data from a second independent cohort totaling 1255 PD cases and 473 controls. No statistically significant enrichment of rare variants across all genes, per gene, or for any individual variant was detected in either cohort. There were nonsignificant trends toward different carrier frequencies between PD cases and controls, under different inheritance models, in the following CMM risk genes: BAP1, DCC, ERBB4, KIT, MAPK2, MITF, PTEN, and TP53. The very rare TYR p.V275F variant, which is a pathogenic allele for recessive albinism, was more common in PD cases than controls in 3 independent cohorts. Tyrosinase, encoded by TYR, is the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of neuromelanin, and has a role in the production of dopamine. These results suggest a possible role for another gene in the dopamine-biosynthetic pathway in susceptibility to neurodegenerative Parkinsonism, but further studies in larger PD cohorts are needed to accurately determine the role of these genes/variants in disease pathogenesis.",

In a quest for alternative therapy targets, we had previously identified Signal Sequence Receptor 2 (SSR2) as a gene with high expression in a subgroup of human primary melanomas. Now we show that SSR2 exerts a prosurvival functionality in human melanoma cells and that high expression levels of SSR2 are associated with an unfavourable disease outcome in primary melanoma patients. Consistent with SSR's role in translocation of proteins from the ribosome across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, our data supports induction of SSR2 as a part of the ER stress response. This response included SSR2 upregulation upon development of therapy resistance to BRAF inhibitors, as well as the dependency of cell survival of BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells on SSR2. Complementary gain and loss of function data showed the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) to ER stress as an inducer of SSR2 via transcriptional regulation through X-Box Binding Protein 1s (XBP1s) and support an ER stress-UPR-Transcription Factor XBP1s-SSR2 response axis in human melanocytic cells. Together with its dispensability for survival in normal human cells, these data propose SSR2 as a potential therapeutic target in (therapy-resistant) human melanoma. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanoma is one of the most lethal forms of skin cancer and its incidence is continuing to rise in the United States. Therefore, novel mechanism and target-based strategies are needed for the management of this disease. SIRT1, a NAD(+)-dependent class III histone deacetylase, has been implicated in a variety of physiological processes and pathological conditions. We recently demonstrated that SIRT1 is upregulated in melanoma and its inhibition by a small-molecule, tenovin-1, inhibits cell proliferation and clonogenic survival of melanoma cells, possibly via activating p53. Here, we employed a gel free quantitative proteomics approach to identify the downstream effectors and targets of SIRT1 in melanoma. The human malignant melanoma, G361 cells were treated with tenovin-1 followed by protein extraction, in liquid trypsin digestion, and peptide analyses using nanoLC-MS/MS. A total of 1091 proteins were identified, of which 20 proteins showed significant differential expression with 95% confidence interval. These proteins were subjected to gene ontology and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to obtain the information regarding their biological and molecular functions. Real-Time qRT-PCR validation showed that five of these (PSAP, MYO1B, MOCOS, HIS1H4A and BUB3) were differentially expressed at mRNA levels. Based on their important role in cell cycle regulation, we selected to focus on BUB family proteins (BUB3, as well as BUB1 and BUBR1) for subsequent validation. The qRT-PCR and immunoblot analyses showed that tenovin-1 inhibition of SIRT1 resulted in a downregulation of BUB3, BUB1 and BUBR1 in multiple melanoma cell lines. Since tenovin-1 is an inhibitor of both SIRT1 and SIRT2, we employed lentivirus mediated silencing of SIRT1 and SIRT2 in G361 cells to determine if the observed effects on BUB family proteins are due to SIRT1- or SIRT2- inhibition. We found that only SIRT1 inhibition resulted in a decrease in BUB3, BUB1 and BUBR1. Our study identified the mitotic checkpoint regulator BUB family proteins as novel downstream targets of SIRT1. However, further validation is needed in appropriate models to confirm our findings and expand on our observations. ",

This technology uses an empirically derived combination of cell line-specific solutions and nucleofector programmes to electroporate nucleic acid substrates directly into the cell nucleus. Using a colorimetric beta-galactosidase assay, we optimized nucleofection parameters for 13 melanoma cell lines, leading to maximum transfection efficiency and cell survival. The combinations of cell solutions NHEM or T and nucleofector programmes A-24 or U-20 produced the best results. We compared nucleofection with two commercially available lipid-based gene transfer systems, effectene and lipofectamine 2000 using a green fluorescent protein reporter vector. Nucleofection demonstrated a 3- to 40-fold improvement in transfection efficiency when compared with the lipid-based counterparts. Nucleofection was also superior in transfecting small-interfering RNA (siRNA) as determined by Western blot analysis. Lastly, we applied nucleofection to the simultaneous transfection of a p53-dependent luciferase plasmid and p53-siRNA.

Inconsistent effects from growth stimulation to induction of apoptosis of malignant tumor cells, however, have been reported. Melanoma is an increasingly common and potentially lethal malignancy. It was reported that melanoma cells were more susceptible to ascorbate toxicity than any other tumor cells. The mechanisms accounting for ascorbate-induced apoptosis in human melanoma cells, however, have remained unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of sodium ascorbate on cytotoxicity and apoptosis in human malignant melanoma A375.S2 cells. A375.S2 cells were incubated with a certain range of concentrations of sodium ascorbate for various time periods. In order to examine the effects of sodium ascorbate on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and necrosis, we performed 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride assays and flow cytometry analysis. Polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the mRNA levels of p53, p21, p27, cyclin A, cyclin E, CDK2 and CDK4, which are associated with cell cycle S-phase arrest and apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis showed that sodium ascorbate significantly induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the A375.S2 cell line in a dose-dependent manner. The increased expressions of p53 and p21, and the decreased expressions of cyclin A, cyclin E, CDK2 and CDK4, indicated the cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase after the cells had been treated with sodium ascorbate. Induction of apoptosis involved an increase in the levels of p53, p21 and cellular Ca, and a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase 3 before culminating in apoptosis in sodium ascorbate-treated A375.S2 cells.",

Three peptides were able to preferentially inhibit the melanoma lineage. A unique peptide, [-CSSRTMHHC-], exhibited in vivo antitumor inhibitory activity against a subcutaneous melanoma challenge, rendering 60% of mice without tumor growth.

In this study we investigated the effect of 13-cis-retinoic acid on the induction of apoptosis as well as its regulatory effect on the activation of transcription factors in B16F-10 melanoma cells. Treatment of B16F-10 cells with 13-cis-retinoic acid showed the presence of apoptotic bodies and induced DNA fragmentation. 13-cis-retinoic acid treatment also showed an inhibitory effect on bcl-2 expression and upregulated p53 and caspase-3 gene expression in B16F-10 melanoma cells. The study also reveals that 13-cis-retinoic acid treatment could alter the production and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and could inhibit the activation and nuclear translocation of p65, p50, and c-Rel subunits of nuclear factor-kappaB, and other transcription factors such as c-fos, activated transcription factor-2, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein in B16F-10 melanoma cells. These results suggest that 13-cis-retinoic acid effectively induces apoptosis in B16F-10 melanoma cells and this compound has the potential as either a therapeutic or chemotherapeutic agent against melanoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"This review is intended to provide an updated role of molecular genetics and various targeted therapies that have been developed to treat advanced stages of melanoma. Because of the declining success in melanoma therapy, the curative treatment for advanced stage melanoma has been a challenge for clinicians. Several mutations such as N-RAS, p53, BRAF including mutant-BRAF that lead to activation of kinase pathway, are implicated in the development of malignant melanoma. However, the current literature depicts that the prognostic role of BRAF mutation in disease progression is still controversial. While its higher level in advanced stage disease is associated with decreased overall survival (OS), some studies show that it failed to confer as an independent prognostic predictor of the disease. This has also led researchers to accomplish newer therapeutic strategies that lead to improved disease-response and grant survival benefits. Vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor agent, is one of the few available targeted therapies that is FDA approved and provides promising results in metastatic disease. However, its resistance at an early stage is of great concern. Recent implementation of combinational therapies including \"targeted therapy\", immunotherapy, and biological agents has appealed many researchers to define the adjunctive role of available therapies and their limitations in advanced stage and metastatic melanoma. This commends the need for future multi-institutional studies to confirm the clinical validity of different therapeutic strategies on a large scale population. ",

The best established association with human malignancy is that of high-risk mucosal HPV types and anogenital cancer. HPV-induced transformation of anogenital epithelia has been the subject of intense research which has identified the cellular tumour suppressor gene products, p53 and pRB, as important targets for the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 respectively. Certain HPV types are also strongly associated with the development of non-melanoma skin cancer in the inherited disorder epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). However, in contrast with anogenital malignancy the oncogenic mechanisms of EV-HPV types remain uncertain, and there appears to be a crucial additional requirement for ultraviolet radiation. Cutaneous HPV types in the general population are predominantly associated with benign viral warts, but a role in non-melanoma skin cancer has recently been postulated. Polymerase chain reaction based HPV detection techniques have shown a high prevalence of HPV DNA, particularly in skin cancers from immunosuppressed patients and to a lesser extent in malignancies from otherwise immunocompetent individuals. No particular HPV type has yet emerged as predominant, and the role of HPV in cutaneous malignancy is unclear at present. It remains to be established whether HPV plays an active or purely a passenger role in the evolution of non-melanoma skin cancer.",

In this context, the SLUG gene has recently been characterized as a major regulator of melanocytes and melanoma cell survival.;We tested the hypothesis that an oligonucleotide-based short interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against the SLUG gene increases the susceptibility of melanoma cells to drugs such as cisplatin and fotemustine, which are frequently used to treat this cancer.;It was found that SLUG siRNA increased cisplatin-induced cell death and rendered the drug active in vitro at half its plasmatic peak concentration. Such activity was correlated with an upregulation of the pro-apoptotic gene, PUMA. Furthermore, SLUG siRNA increased the capacity of fotemustine to elicit cell death and induced p21WAF1 upregulation, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, this pathway did not require functional p53.;These findings suggest that SLUG siRNA enhances the efficacy of two of the most widely used drugs to treat melanoma.",

The p53 homologues, p73 and p63, are located on chromosomes 1p and 3q, respectively. Both are able to activate p53 target genes, resulting in growth arrest, apoptosis and differentiation. N-terminally truncated isoforms of these genes may act as dominant negative inhibitors of wild-type p53 and transactivating activity. Although, p53 is frequently involved in several malignancies it does not play a major role in UM. Altered expression has been reported for both p63 and p73 in various malignancies. In this study, fluorescent in-situ hybridization was performed to identify gains or losses of p63 and p73 loci in UM. The expression of the different p63 and p73 isoforms was evaluated by reverse transcriptase PCR followed by Southern blot analysis. Furthermore, the expression pattern of the various DeltaTAp73 transcripts was analysed in seven primary UMs and 11 UM-derived cell lines using isoform-specific real-time PCR. Our results indicated that the isoform p73Deltaex2/3 was abundantly expressed and a relative loss of the p73 locus was associated with the upregulation of p73Deltaex2 and TAp73 transcripts. N-terminal transactivation forms of both p73 and p63 were observed in primary and metastasis-derived cell lines, as well as in primary melanomas, but in only one of the cell lines a DeltaNp63 mRNA transcript was observed. Our data suggest a potential function of p73 deletion transcripts in UM progression.",

In 1205Lu cells, JNK inhibition induced cell cycle arrest through p53-dependent induction of p21 Cip1/Waf1 expression, while in WM983B cells, induction of apoptosis by JNK inhibition was accompanied by p53, Bad and Bax induction, not p21 Cip1/Waf1. JNK inhibition with the small molecule inhibitor SP600125 slowed growth of all cell lines, although the effect was markedly greater in cells exhibiting high phospho- (P-)JNK1 levels. Specific gene knockdown of JNK1 by means of siRNA oligonucleotides inhibited cell growth only in melanoma cell lines exhibiting high P-JNK1 levels. siRNAs directed against JNK2 did not reduce cell growth in any of the cell lines tested.

An indole carboxylate-PBD hybrid with six-carbon spacer structure (IN6CPBD) has been previously demonstrated to induce melanoma cell apoptosis and reduce metastasis in mouse lungs. This study aimed at investigating the efficacy of the other hybrid compound with four-carbon spacer (IN4CPBD) and elucidating its anti-metastatic mechanism. Human melanoma A375 cells with IN4CPBD treatment underwent cytotoxicity and apoptosis-associated assays. Transwell migration assay, Western blotting, and ELISA were used for mechanistic study. IN4CPBD exhibited potent melanoma cytotoxicity through interrupting G1/S cell cycle progression, increasing DNA fragmentation and hypodipoidic DNA contents, and reducing mitochondrial membrane potential. Caspase activity elevation suggested that both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways were involved in IN4CPBD-induced melanoma apoptosis. IN4CPBD up-regulated p53 and p21, thereby concomitantly derailing the equilibrium between Bcl-2 and Bax levels. Transwell migration assay demonstrated that stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) stimulated A375 cell motility, while kinase inhibitors treatment confirmed that Rho/ROCK, Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK pathways were involved in SDF-1α-enhanced melanoma migration. IN4CPBD not only abolished the SDF-1α-enhanced chemotactic motility but also suppressed constitutive MMP-9 and VEGF expression. Mechanistically, IN4CPBD down-regulated Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK total proteins and MYPT1 phosphorylation. In conclusion, beyond the fact that IN4CPBD induces melanoma cell apoptosis at cytotoxic dose, the interruption in the VEGF expression and the SDF-1α-related signaling at cytostatic dose may partially constitute the rationale for its in vivo anti-metastatic potency.",

In several studies, NF-κB activation was shown to be an adverse prognostic factor, and in melanoma it was proposed as an event that promotes tumor progression. This study aimed to evaluate whether NF-κB activation in tumor tissues, assessed by the expression of the NF-κB p65 subunit, has an effect on the survival of melanoma patients. The expression of NF-κB was immunohistochemically investigated, and the correlation with survival was analyzed. Furthermore, the immunostaining for p53 and survivin was evaluated, and the relationship of these apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors with NF-κB expression was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with low levels of NF-κB in the nuclei of tumor cells had a significantly longer survival compared to those with high levels. Multivariate analysis confirmed the predictive value of nuclear NF-κB, showing that its expression maintains significance after the model was adjusted using clinicopathological factors. The results demonstrate the correlation of NF-κB p65 nuclear staining with the disease-specific 5-year survival of melanoma patients and suggest that nuclear NF-κB p65 may be promising as an early independent prognostic factor in patients with primary cutaneous melanoma.",

In the two cell lines, the slowing of proliferation coincided with an increase in the activity and amount of immunoreactive superoxide dismutases (SOD1 and SOD2), and a decrease of catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities, and of the glutathione content. The levels of p21WAF1 and p53 proteins were found to be lower in confluent than in proliferative cells. Several parameters were modified only during the differentiation phase of IGR221 cells; in these cells the increase of tyrosinase activity was highly correlated with the increase in SOD2, GST, glutathione reductase, and G6PD activities.

        "Doc_abstract":"Germline mutations of the CDKN2A gene are found in melanoma-prone families and individuals with multiple sporadic melanomas. The encoded protein, p16(INK4A), comprises four ankyrin-type repeats, and the mutations, most of which are missense and occur throughout the entire coding region, can disrupt the conformation of these structural motifs as well as the association of p16(INK4a) with its physiological targets, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) CDK4 and CDK6. Assessing pathogenicity of nonsynonymous mutations is critical to evaluate melanoma risk in carriers. In the current study, we investigate 20 CDKN2A germline mutations whose effects on p16(INK4A) structure and function have not been previously documented (Thr18_Ala19dup, Gly23Asp, Arg24Gln, Gly35Ala, Gly35Val, Ala57Val, Ala60Val, Ala60Arg, Leu65dup, Gly67Arg, Gly67_Asn71del, Glu69Gly, Asp74Tyr, Thr77Pro, Arg80Pro, Pro81Thr, Arg87Trp, Leu97Arg, Arg99Pro, and [Leu113Leu;Pro114Ser]). By considering genetic information, the predicted impact of each variant on the protein structure, its ability to interact with CDK4 and impede cell proliferation in experimental settings, we conclude that 18 of the 20 CDKN2A variants can be classed as loss of function mutations, whereas the results for two remain ambiguous. Discriminating between mutant and neutral variants of p16(INK4A) not only adds to our understanding of the functionally critical residues in the protein but provides information that can be used for melanoma risk prediction.",

The combination of recombinant human fibroblast interferon and the antileukemic agent mezerein corrects these abnormalities in cultured human melanoma cells resulting in irreversible growth arrest and terminal differentiation. Subtraction hybridization identifies a melanoma differentiation associated gene (mda-7) with elevated expression in growth arrested and terminally differentiated human melanoma cells. Colony formation decreases when mda-7 is transfected into human tumor cells of diverse origin and with multiple genetic defects. In contrast, the effects of mda-7 on growth and colony formation in transient transfection assays with normal cells, including human mammary epithelial, human skin fibroblast, and rat embryo fibroblast, is quantitatively less than that found with cancer cells. Tumor cells expressing elevated mda-7 display suppression in monolayer growth and anchorage independence. Infection with a recombinant type 5 adenovirus expressing antisense mda-7 eliminates mda-7 suppression of the in vitro growth and transformed phenotype. The ability of mda-7 to suppress growth in cancer cells not expressing or containing defects in both the retinoblastoma (RB) and p53 genes indicates a lack of involvement of these critical tumor suppressor elements in mediating mda-7-induced growth inhibition. The lack of protein homology of mda-7 with previously described growth suppressing genes and the differential effect of this gene on normal versus cancer cells suggests that mda-7 may represent a new class of cancer growth suppressing genes with antitumor activity.",

We studied whether application of TTT influences the immunogenicity of the tumour cells in vivo or the expression of molecules related to apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies directed against HLA molecules, HMB45, P53, Fas ligand (FasL), Fas, Bcl-2 and tumour-infiltrating cells was applied to sections of an enucleated eye containing a uveal melanoma that received TTT 1 week before enucleation. The innermost part of the tumour which had been exposed directly to the laser treatment showed no staining for HLA antigens, nor for Fas or FasL epitopes. The intermediate part of the tumour showed a wet necrosis and HLA expression similar to the expression in the peripheral tumour. A large number of macrophages were observed in the necrotic as well as the intact tumour tissue, especially bordering the wet necrotic area. FasL and Bcl-2 were only expressed in the viable, outer part of the tumour. This immunological evaluation of one case of uveal melanoma treated with TTT revealed that TTT may not only have a direct destructive effect on the primary tumour, but may also influence the immunogenicity of uveal melanoma cells, induce infiltration of macrophages into the tumour, and induce apoptosis. The presence of many macrophages suggests that they play a role in the removal of the TTT-treated tumour tissue by phagocytosis.",

We previously identified the tumor suppressor MEN1 as a gene required for oncogene-induced senescence in melanocytes, raising the possibility that MEN1 is a melanoma tumor suppressor. Here we show that MEN1 expression is lost in a high percentage of human melanomas and melanoma cell lines. We find that melanocytes depleted of MEN1 are deficient in homologous recombination (HR)-directed DNA repair, which is accompanied by increased nonhomologous end-joining activity. Following DNA damage, MEN1 levels increase as a result of phosphorylation by the DNA damage kinase ATM/ATR. Most importantly, we show that MEN1 functions by directly stimulating the transcription of several genes, including BRCA1, RAD51, and RAD51AP1, that encode proteins involved in HR. MEN1 and its coactivator, the mixed-lineage leukemia histone methyltransferase, are recruited to the BRCA1, RAD51, and RAD51AP1 promoters by estrogen receptor 1, resulting in increased histone H3-lysine 4 trimethylation and transcription. Collectively, our results indicate that MEN1 is a melanoma tumor suppressor that functions by stimulating the transcription of genes involved in HR-directed DNA repair.",

As a consequence, the translation of these mRNAs is inhibited or they are destabilized resulting in downregulation of the encoded protein. The microRNA-34 (miR-34) family, which comprises three processed microRNAs (miR-34a/b/c) was identified as the mediator of tumor suppression by p53. Many reports suggest that the miR-34s contribute to the inhibition of invasion or metastasis in various tumor types. In this study, we evaluated the expression of the miR-34 family in four human melanoma cell lines (A375, G361, C32TG and SK-MEL-24) which have the wild-type p53 gene using real-time reverse transcription PCR. We also examined their generative and invasive characteristics using the cell proliferation assay and the invasion/migration assay, respectively. All four melanoma cell lines showed significant expression of miR-34s - A375: miR-34a 0.6176, miR-34b 0.7625, miR-34c 0.7877; G361: 7.6424, 16.4127, 22.0332; C32TG: 2.1630, 2.1091, 8.4425; SK-MEL-24: 0.3621, 2.5659, 8.5907. The cell doubling times of these cell lines in h:min were as follows: A375 23:23, G361 68:24, C32TG 47:22 and SK-MEL-24 67:03. The in vitro generation times of G361 and SK-MEL-24, which showed increased expression of miR-34c, were significantly shorter than A375 with decreased expression of miR-34c (p=0.0063, ANOVA). Invasion (%) of the four cell lines was as follows: A375 44.0%, G361 22.4%, C32TG 13.8% and SK-MEL-24 45.0%. In vitro invasiveness of G361 and C32TG, which showed increased expression of miR-34a, was significantly suppressed (p= 0.005, ANOVA).

We describe here for the first time that the synthetic retinoid CD437 has a strong dose-dependent antiproliferative effect on human melanoma cells (IC50: 5 x 10(-6) M) via the induction of programmed cell death, as judged by analysis of cell morphology, electron microscopical features, and DNA fragmentation. Programmed cell death was preceded by a strong activation of the AP-1 complex in CD437-treated cells as demonstrated by gel retardation and chloramphenicol transferase (CAT) assays. Northern blot analysis showed a time-dependent increase in the expression of c-fos and c-jun encoding components of AP-1, whereas bcl-2 and p53 mRNA levels remained constant. CD437 also exhibited a strong growth inhibitory effect on MeWo melanoma cells in a xenograft model. In tissue sections of CD437-treated MeWo tumors from these animals, apoptotic melanoma cells and c-fos overexpressing cells were colocalized by TdT-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-digoxigenin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and in situ hybridization. Taken together, this report identifies CD437 as a retinoid that activates and upregulates the transcription factor AP-1, leading eventually to programmed cell death of exposed human melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether synthetic retinoids such as CD437 represent a new class of retinoids, which may open up new ways to a more effective therapy of malignant melanoma.",

Furthermore, the actions of TNF-alpha were suppressed by the addition of an anti-inflammatory peptide alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). In the current study, we extend this work investigating to what extent TNF-alpha might stimulate melanoma invasion by promoting cell migration and whether alpha-MSH is also inhibitory. Two human melanoma cell lines were examined in vitro (HBL and C8161) using a scratch migration assay. Analysis using either time-lapse video microscopy or imaging software analysis of migrating 'fronts' of cells revealed that C8161 cells migrated more rapidly than HBL cells. However, when cells were stimulated with TNF-alpha both cell types responded with a significant increase in migration distance over a 16-26 h incubation time. alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone had an inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha-stimulated migration for HBL cells, completely blocking migration at 10(-9) M. In contrast, C8161 cells did not respond to alpha-MSH (as these cells have a loss-of-function melanocortin-1 receptor). However, stable transfection of C8161 cells with the wild-type melanocortin-1 receptor produced cells whose migration was significantly inhibited by alpha-MSH. In addition, the use of a neutralising antibody to the beta(1)-integrin subunit significantly reduced migration in both cell types. This data therefore supports an inflammatory environment promoting melanoma cell migration, and in addition shows that alpha-MSH can inhibit inflammatory stimulated migration. The data also support a fundamental role of the beta(1)-integrin receptor in melanoma cell migration.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind formation of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, is crucial for improved diagnosis and treatment. One key is to better understand the cross-talk between epidermal keratinocytes and pigment-producing melanocytes. Here, using a bigenic mouse model system combining mutant oncogenic NRAS(Q61K) (constitutively active RAS) or mutant activated CDK4(R24C/R24C) (prevents binding of CDK4 by kinase inhibitor p16(INK4A)) with an epidermis-specific knockout of the nuclear retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα(ep-/-)) results in increased melanoma formation after chronic ultraviolet-B (UVB) irradiation compared with control mice with functional RXRα. Melanomas from both groups of bigenic RXRα(ep-/-) mice are larger in size with higher proliferative capacity, and exhibit enhanced angiogenic properties and increased expression of malignant melanoma markers. Analysis of tumor adjacent normal skin from these mice revealed altered expression of several biomarkers indicative of enhanced melanoma susceptibility, including reduced expression of tumor suppressor p53 and loss of PTEN, with concomitant increase in activated AKT. Loss of epidermal RXRα in combination with UVB significantly enhances invasion of melanocytic cells to draining lymph nodes in bigenic mice expressing oncogenic NRAS(Q61K) compared with controls with functional RXRα. These results suggest a crucial role of keratinocytic RXRα to suppress formation of UVB-induced melanomas and their progression to malignant cancers in the context of driver mutations such as activated CDK4(R24C/R24C) or oncogenic NRAS(Q61K).;These findings suggest that RXRα may serve as a clinical diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in melanoma progression and metastasis.",

We exposed these cells to X-rays and to accelerated carbon-ion (C-) beams. Cellular sensitivities were determined by using clonogenic assay. Apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths were determined morphologically by dual staining (acridine orange and ethidium bromide) using fluorescence microscopy. We discovered that (1) there was no significant difference in survival fraction between A375 cells and A375/p53 cells irradiated by C-beams with greater than 32 KeV/microm LET, (2) although apoptosis in the two kinds of cells increased in an LET-dependent manner, exogenous wild-type P53 induced cell apoptosis efficiently in A375/p53 relative to A375 cells with X-rays or high-LET irradiation, and (3) by high-LET irradiation, the number of necrosis in A375 cells increased significantly (P < 0.05) in comparison with A375/p53 cells. These results indicate that in high-LET irradiation apoptosis induction is p53 dependent partly and exogenous wild-type P53 plays an important role in modulating cell death type, although there was no significant difference in cellular radiosensitivities.

However, it remains unclear whether or not the expression of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) has prognostic significance in patients with cutaneous melanoma. A total of 128 patients with cutaneous melanoma were evaluated. Tumor sections were stained by immunohistochemistry for LAT1, CD98, Ki-67, and microvessel density determined by CD34 and p53. We also analyzed 30 specimens of patients with melanocytic nevi as negative controls. LAT1 and CD98 were highly expressed in 58% (75/128) and 75% (97/128), respectively. The rates of positivity for LAT1 in the melanocytic nevi were 0% (0/30). The expression of LAT1 was associated significantly with tumor thickness, T factor, CD98 expression, cell proliferation (Ki-67), and microvessel density (CD34). By Spearman's rank test, LAT1 expression was correlated with CD98, Ki-67, and CD34. By univariate analysis, tumor thickness, ulceration, disease staging, LAT1, and CD34 showed a significant relationship with overall survival and disease-free survival. Furthermore, a multivariate analysis confirmed that LAT1 was an independent prognostic factor for predicting a poor prognosis. This study had a small sample size.

Melanoma shows weak response to TRAIL because of its low level of TRAIL death receptors. Here, we investigated whether indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, can potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells. We showed that indomethacin was capable of promoting TRAIL-induced cell death and apoptosis in A375 melanoma cells. Mechanistically, indomethacin induced cell surface expression of death receptor 5 (DR5) in melanoma cells and also in various types of cancer cells. DR5 knockdown abolished the enhancing effect of indomethacin on TRAIL responses. Induction of the DR5 by indomethacin was found to be p53 independent but dependent on the induction of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP). Knockdown of CHOP abolished indomethacin-induced DR5 expression and the associated potentiation of TRAIL-mediated cell death. In addition, indomethacin-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production preceded upregulation of CHOP and DR5, and consequent sensitization of cells to TRAIL. We also found that indomethacin treatment downregulated survivin via ROS and the NF-κB-mediated signaling pathways. Interestingly, indomethacin also converted TRAIL-resistant melanoma MeWo and SK-MEL-5 cells into TRAIL-sensitive cells. Taken together, our results indicate that indomethacin can potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptosis through upregulation of death receptors and downregulation of survivin. ",

Oncostatin M (OSM) is the most active IL-6-type cytokine and inhibits the proliferation of various solid tumor cell lines. Multigene-based combination therapy may be an effective practice in cancer gene therapy. The therapeutic potential of a combination of IL-24 and OSM in treating cancers is still elusive. In this study, we aimed to examine the enhanced antitumor activity of adenovirus-mediated IL-24/OSM tumor suppressor gene cotransfer in human melanoma cells. We constructed an IL-24/OSM bicistronic adenovirus and assessed its combined effect on A375 human melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo by detecting and comparing apoptosis in the bicistronic antioncogene group (Ad-IL-24-OSM) and in the IL-24 or OSM single antioncogene group. We also investigated the possible mechanism underlying this effect. The bicistronic adenovirus-mediated coexpression of IL-24 and OSM induced additive growth suppression and apoptosis and an overlapping effect on the upregulation of p21, p53, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Ad-IL-24-OSM treatment additively reduced the expression of CDK4 and cyclin D1 in A375 melanoma cells and the expression of CD34 and Cox-2 in A375 xenograft tumors in athymic nude mice. The enhanced antitumor activity elicited by Ad-IL-24-OSM was closely associated with the activation of the apoptotic pathway and the additive inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Therefore, our results indicate that cancer gene therapy combining two or more tumor suppressors, such as IL-24 and OSM, may constitute a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for treating malignant melanoma and other cancers.

To validate the potential of SPARC as a therapeutic target, we examined the effect of the knockdown of SPARC with SPARC-specific siRNA on the growth of human melanoma cell lines. SPARC siRNAs exerted a potent knockdown effect. Silencing of SPARC resulted in growth inhibition with G(1) arrest accompanied by accumulation of p21, a G(1) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, in MeWo and CRL1579 cells. Moreover, the induction of p53 was observed in MeWo cells, but not in CRL1579 cells. Conditioned media containing SPARC from MeWo cells could not restore the growth of SPARC-silenced MeWo cells. This result suggests that intracellular SPARC, but not secreted SPARC, is involved in cell proliferation. In addition, silencing of SPARC induced apoptosis in MeWo and CRL1579 cells. Furthermore, when MeWo cells in which SPARC expression was transiently knocked down by SPARC siRNA were implanted in nude mice, the tumor growth was suppressed.

Drivers are often directly or inversely correlated across tumors, reflecting the molecular and regulatory signaling pathways in which they operate. Here, a profile of genetic and epigenetic drivers in 110 human melanoma cell lines was generated and searched for non-random distribution patterns. Statistically significant mutual exclusivity was revealed among components of each of the p16(INK4A)-CDK4-RB, RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. In addition, an inverse correlation was observed between promoter hypermethylation of retinoic acid receptor β (RARB) and CDKN2A alterations affecting p14(ARF) (P < 0.0001), suggesting a functional link between RARβ signaling and the melanoma-suppressive activities of p14(ARF). Mechanistically, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment increased the expression of p14(ARF) in primary human melanocytes and the steady-state levels of p14(ARF) in these cells were shown to be regulated via RARβ. Furthermore, the ability of ATRA to induce senescence is reduced in p14(ARF)-depleted melanocytes, and we provide proof-of-concept that ATRA can induce irreversible growth arrest in melanoma cells with an intact RARβ-p14(ARF) signaling axis, independent of p16(INK4A) and p53 status.;These data highlight the power of mutual exclusivity analysis of cancer drivers to unravel molecular pathways and establish a previously unrecognized cross-talk between RARβ and p14(ARF) with potential implications for melanoma treatment.",

However, a variety of clinical studies indicate that inhibiting the MAPK pathway is insufficient per se to effectively kill melanoma cells. Here, we report on a genetic and pharmacologic approach to identify survival factors responsible for the resistance of melanoma cells to MEK/ERK antagonists. In addition, we describe a new tumor cell-selective means to bypass this resistance in vitro and in vivo. By generating a panel of isogenic cell lines with specific defects in the apoptotic machinery, we found that the ability of melanoma cells to survive in the absence of functional MEK relies on an ERK-independent expression of the antiapoptotic factor Mcl-1 (and to a lesser extent, Bcl-x(L) and Bcl-2). Using computer-based modeling, we developed a novel Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3) mimetic. This compound, named TW-37, is the first rationally designed small molecule with high affinity for Mcl-1, Bcl-x(L), and Bcl-2. Mechanistic analyses of the mode of action of TW-37 showed a synergistic tumor cell killing in the presence of MEK inhibitors. Importantly, TW-37 unveiled an unexpected role of the MAPK pathway in the control of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This function was critical to prevent the activation of proapoptotic functions of p53 in melanoma cells, but surprisingly, it was dispensable for normal melanocytes. Our results suggest that this MAPK-dependent ROS/p53 feedback loop is a point of vulnerability of melanoma cells that can be exploited for rational drug design.",

The death ligand TRAIL appears as promising in cancer treatment; however, melanoma cells reveal both preexisting and inducible TRAIL resistance. Here, we present evidence that the recently described indirubin derivative 8-Rha-β enhances melanoma cell sensitivity for death ligands and overcomes resistance to TRAIL and CD95 agonists. Indirubin is known from traditional Chinese medicine and is a potent kinase inhibitor. Unraveling of apoptotic signaling pathways revealed that TRAIL resulted in a quick (within 8h) downregulation of both agonistic TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5, in a kind of negative feed-back loop. Treatment with indirubin, however, mediated upregulation of both receptors, thus compensating this negative feed-back loop by TRAIL. Furthermore, indirubin activated intrinsic apoptosis pathways, seen in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c. The mitochondrial response appeared as related to upregulation of Bax and Bad and to downregulation of Mcl-1. Remarkably, indirubin in combination with TRAIL was also able to overcome apoptosis resistance due to ectopic Bcl-2 overexpression. The tumor suppressor p53 appeared as master regulator of these propapoptotic changes and is the transactivator of proapoptotic proteins which was upregulated by indirubin. Taking into account the physiological role of death ligands in immune surveillance, sensitization of melanoma cells for death ligands may be supportive for an anti-tumor immune response.

        "Doc_abstract":"Increasing evidence has demonstrated that in several tumors c-myc acts either as an oncogène or as a proapoptotic agent, depending on binding partner interactions. Recently, we showed that up-regulation of this gene by the histone deacetylase inhibitor MS-275 was responsible for sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through c-FLIP repression in melanoma. The present study aimed at investigating whether, in addition to inducing H3 hyperacetylation at the c-myc promoter, MS-275 could enhance cell death through the regulation of miRNAs involved in apoptosis, such as the miR-17-92 cluster. Following MS-275 treatment, a decrease in miR-92a-3p was observed either in TRAIL-resistant or TRAIL-sensitive cutaneous and uveal melanoma cells. Prediction tools revealed that miR-92a-3p targeted MYCBP2. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that the 3'-UTR of MYCBP2 mRNA was the target of miR-92a-3p, as ectopic expression of miR-92a-3p resulted in MYCBP2 downregulation whereas miR-92a-3p knockdown markedly increased the expression of MYCBP2. Silencing of MYCBP2 counteracted the pro-apoptotic effects exerted by the down-regulation of miR-92a-3p and prevented c-myc-induced repression of c-FLIP, indicating a pivotal role of MYCBP2 as a mediator of miR-92a-3p and c-myc function. Together, our findings indicate that the MS-275-triggered downregulation of the oncogenic miR-92a-3p- which leads to the overexpression of its target gene MYCBP2 - is an event required for the enhanced susceptibility of melanoma cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Our data illustrate another epigenetic mechanism activated by MS-275 at the post-transcriptional level in melanoma, in addition to its best-known effects at the transcriptional level.",

Based on the established sensitivity of metastatic melanoma cells to pharmacological modulation of cellular oxidative stress, we tested feasibility of using DP for chemotherapeutic intervention targeting human A375 melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. DP treatment induced caspase-dependent cell death in cultured human metastatic melanoma cells (A375, G361) without compromising viability of primary epidermal melanocytes, an effect not observed with the thiol-antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and dithiothreitol. Focused gene expression array analysis followed by immunoblot detection revealed that DP rapidly activates the cytotoxic unfolded protein response (UPR; involving phospho-PERK, phospho-eIF2α, Grp78, CHOP, and Hsp70) and the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis with p53 upregulation and modulation of Bcl-2 family members (involving Noxa, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2). DP (but not NAC) induced oxidative stress with early impairment of glutathione homeostasis and mitochondrial transmembrane potential. SiRNA-based antagonism of PMAIP1 expression blocked DP-induced upregulation of the proapoptotic BH3-only effector Noxa and prevented downregulation of the Noxa-antagonist Mcl-1, rescuing melanoma cells from DP-induced apoptosis. Intraperitoneal administration of DP displayed significant antimelanoma activity in a murine A375 xenograft model. It remains to be seen if melanoma cell-directed induction of UPR and apoptosis using DP or improved DP-derivatives can be harnessed for future chemotherapeutic intervention.",

Therefore, we examined the effects of this polyphenol on the growth of weakly metastatic Line IV clone 3 and on autologous, highly metastatic Line IV clone 1 cultured melanoma cells. Comparable inhibition of growth and colony formation resulted from treatment by resveratrol in both cell lines. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that resveratrol-treated clone 1 cells had a dose-dependent increase in S phase and a concomitant reduction in the G(1) phase. No detectable change in cell cycle phase distribution was found in similarly treated clone 3 cells. Western blots demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of the tumor suppressor gene p53, without a commensurate change in p21 and several other cell cycle regulatory proteins in both cell types. Chromatography of Line IV clone 3 and clone 1 cell extracts on resveratrol affinity columns revealed that the basal expression of dihydronicotinamide riboside quinone reductase 2 (NQO2) was higher in Line IV clone 1 than clone 3 cells. Levels of NQO2 but not its structural analog NQO1 were dose-dependently increased by resveratrol in both cell lines.

Chromosome 17 contains important tumor suppressor genes such as p53, NM23, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which have been implicated in melanoma tumorigenesis. The role of p53 has already been studied by a number of laboratories, showing contrasting results. In the present study, two restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) probes for the NM23 and NF1 genes, together with five other RFLP and four variable number of tandem repeat chromosome 17 probes, were investigated at the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) level in a Southern blot-based assay. The NF1 gene was also tested for LOH by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach in two different experiments, using a dinucleotide repeat polymorphic probe at locus D17S250 (17q11.2-q12), and an Alu probe intragenic to the NF1 gene (17q11.2). A PCR single-strand conformation polymorphism assay was included in the study for mutation detection at the NF1-GTPase-activating protein-related domain (GRD). A total of 68 melanocytic tumors were analyzed. LOH was detected in 9 of 87 informative cases (10%). LEW301 (17p11.2-pcen) presented the highest LOH frequency (22%). NM23 showed LOH in 17% of the informative cases, while NF1 did not show either LOH in the Southern blot- and PCR-based experiments or mutations at the NF1-GRD. These results are in concordance with those of previous smaller studies, but when compared with higher LOH frequencies obtained from other chromosomes, these findings indicate that the LOH values found in our study can most likely be attributed to background effect. Thus, chromosome 17 LOH is likely to play and unimportant role as a genetic event in melanoma tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, NF1 merits further study, since homozygous deletions have been detected at this locus in melanoma cell lines.",

We propose a strategy for melanoma prevention based on using analogs of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) that function as melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) agonists. Treatment of human melanocytes with alpha-MSH results in stimulation of eumelanin synthesis, reduction of apoptosis that is attributable to reduced hydrogen peroxide generation and enhanced repair of DNA photoproducts. These effects should contribute to genomic stability of human melanocytes, thus preventing their malignant transformation to melanoma. Based on these findings, we synthesized and tested the effects of 3 tetrapeptide alpha-MSH analogs, Ac-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-NH2, n-Pentadecanoyl- and 4-Phenylbutyryl-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-NH2, on cultured human melanocytes. The latter two analogs were more potent than the former, or alpha-MSH, in stimulating the activity of tyrosinase, thus melanogenesis, reducing apoptosis and release of hydrogen peroxide and enhancing repair of DNA photoproducts in melanocytes exposed to UV radiation (UVR). The above analogs are MC1R agonists, as their effects were abrogated by an analog of agouti signaling protein, the physiological MC1R antagonist, and were absent in melanocytes expressing loss-of-function MC1R.

Significant levels of GGT activity are expressed by malignant tumours, and in melanoma cell lines they were found to correlate with the malignant behaviour. As hydrogen peroxide and other oxidants can affect signal transduction pathways at several levels, the present study was aimed to verify: (i) the occurrence of GGT-dependent production of hydrogen peroxide in melanoma cells; (ii) the effects of GGT-dependent prooxidant reactions on known redox-sensitive cellular targets, i.e. protein thiols, the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B and p53. Two melanoma Me665/2 cell clones, exhibiting traces of (clone 2/21) or high (clone 2/60) GGT activity, were studied. The occurrence of GGT-dependent production of hydrogen peroxide was apparent in 2/60 cells, in which it was accompanied by lower levels of cell surface protein thiols. In 2/60 cells, GGT expression was also associated with higher levels of NF-kappa B activation, as compared to GGT-poor 2/21 cell clone. Indeed, stimulation or inhibition of GGT activity in 2/60 cells resulted in progressive activation or inactivation of NF-kappa B, respectively. An analysis of the p53 gene product indicated lack of protein expression in 2/60 cells, whereas a mutant protein was highly expressed in 2/21 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that the expression of GGT activity can provide melanoma cells with an additional source of hydrogen peroxide, and that such prooxidant reactions are capable to modify protein thiols at the cell surface level. In addition, GGT expression results in an up-regulation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B, which could explain the higher metastatic behaviour reported for GGT-rich melanoma cells as compared to their GGT-poor counterparts.",

A requisite component for improving gene-based therapies of brain cancer includes tumor suppressor genes that exhibit cancer constrained inhibitory activity. Subtraction hybridization identified melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (mda-7) as a gene associated with melanoma cell growth, differentiation and progression. Ectopic expression of mda-7 by means of a replication-incompetent adenovirus (Ad), Ad.mda-7, induces growth suppression and apoptosis selectively in diverse human cancers, without producing any apparent harmful effect in normal cells. We presently demonstrate that Ad.mda-7 induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in malignant human gliomas expressing both mutant and wild-type p53, and these effects correlate with an elevation in expression of members of the growth arrest and DNA damage (GADD) gene family. In contrast, infection with a recombinant Ad expressing wild-type p53, Ad.wtp53, specifically affects mutant p53 expressing gliomas. When tested in early passage normal and immortal human fetal astrocytes, growth inhibition resulting from infection with Ad.mda-7 or Ad.wtp53 is significantly less than in malignant gliomas and no toxicity is evident in these normal cells. Moreover, infection of gliomas with Ad.mda-7 or treatment with purified GST-MDA-7 protein sensitizes both wild-type and mutant p53 expressing tumor cells to the growth inhibitory and antisurvival effects of ionizing radiation, and this response correlates with increased expression of specific members of the GADD gene family. Since heterogeneity in p53 expression is common in evolving gliomas, the present findings suggest that Ad.mda-7 may, in many instances, prove more beneficial for the gene-based therapy of malignant gliomas than administration of wild-type p53.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Skin cancers, i.e., basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and melanoma, belong to the most frequent tumors. Their formation is based on constitutional and/or inherited factors usually combined with environmental factors, mainly UV-irradiation through long term sun exposure. UV-light can randomly induce DNA damage in keratinocytes, but it can also mutate genes essential for control and surveillance in the skin epidermis. Various repair and safety mechanisms exist to maintain the integrity of the skin epidermis. For example, UV-light damaged DNA is repaired and if this is not possible, the DNA damaged cells are eliminated by apoptosis (sunburn cells). This occurs under the control of the p53 suppressor gene. Fas-ligand (FasL), a member of the tumor necrosis superfamily, which is preferentially expressed in the basal layer of the skin epidermis, is a key surveillance molecule involved in the elimination of sunburn cells, but also in the prevention of cell transformation. However, UV light exposure downregulates FasL expression in keratinocytes and melanocytes leading to the loss of its sensor function. This increases the risk that transformed cells are not eliminated anymore. Moreover, important control and surveillance genes can also be directly affected by UV-light. Mutation in the p53 gene is the starting point for the formation of SCC and some forms of BCC. Other BCCs originate through UV light mediated mutations of genes of the hedgehog signaling pathway which are essential for the maintainance of cell growth and differentiation. The transcription factor Gli2 plays a key role within this pathway, indeed, Gli2 is responsible for the marked apoptosis resistance of the BCCs. The formation of malignant melanoma is very complex. Melanocytes form nevi and from the nevi melanoma can develop through mutations in various genes. Once the keratinocytes or melanocytes have been transformed they re-express FasL which may allow the expanding tumor to evade the attack of immune effector cells. FasL which is involved in immune evasion or genes which govern the apoptosis resistance, e.g., Gli2 could therefore be prime targets to prevent tumor formation and growth. Attempts to silence these genes by RNA interference using gene specific short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) have been functionally successful not only in tissue cultures and tumor tissues, but also in a mouse model. Thus, siRNAs and/or shRNAs may become a novel and promising approach to treat skin cancers at an early stage.",

Functional analysis reveals these mutations ablate canonical TGFβ Smad signalling, which is localized to bulge stem cells in both normal human and murine skin. MAPK pathway hyperactivation (through Braf(V600E) or Kras(G12D) knockin) and TGFβ signalling ablation (through Tgfbr1 deletion) in LGR5(+ve) stem cells enables rapid cSCC development in the mouse. Mutation of Tp53 (which is commonly mutated in sporadic cSCC) coupled with Tgfbr1 deletion in LGR5(+ve) cells also results in cSCC development. These findings indicate that LGR5(+ve) stem cells may act as cells of origin for cSCC, and that RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway hyperactivation or Tp53 mutation, coupled with loss of TGFβ signalling, are driving events of skin tumorigenesis.

A semi-quantitative RT-PCR method was developed to allow the analysis of the expression of 5 p53 effector genes (p21(WAF1), mdm2, cyclin G1, gadd45, bax) at the same time with a small amount of RNA (1 microg). In human melanocytic cells, the p53 downstream genes were found to be differentially activated after UVB and UVC irradiation. After UVB irradiation, p53 protein accumulation was sustained up to 48 hr that was not the case after UVC irradiation. Among the p53 effector genes tested, gadd45 was the only 1 to show a strong and specific induction after UVB irradiation. With high UVB doses, gadd45 was also the only gene to be transcribed. By contrast, after UVC irradiation, all the p53 effector genes tested were transcriptionally induced. Experiments conducted with fibroblasts and keratinocytes didn't show such a striking activation of gadd45 after UVB irradiation. These results point out the potential role of gadd45 in response to UVB irradiation in human melanocytes and the different p53-mediated responses to different carcinogens.",

Here, we employed an adenoviral vector where transgene expression is controlled by p53 to deliver the p19 alternate reading frame (Arf) and interferon-β (IFNβ) complementary DNAs in the B16 mouse model of melanoma. In vitro, cell death was enhanced by combined gene transfer (63.82±15.30% sub-G0 cells); yet introduction of a single gene resulted in significantly fewer hypoploid cells (37.73±7.3% or 36.96±11.58%, p19Arf or IFNβ, respectively, P<0.05). Annexin V staining and caspase-3 cleavage indicate a cell death mechanism consistent with apoptosis. Using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR, we show that key transcriptional targets of p53 were upregulated in the presence of p19Arf, although treatment with IFNβ did not alter expression of the genes studied. In situ gene therapy revealed significant inhibition of subcutaneous tumors by IFNβ (571±25 mm3) or the combination of p19Arf and IFNβ (489±124 mm3) as compared with the LacZ control (1875±33 mm3, P<0.001), whereas p19Arf yielded an intermediate result (1053±169 mm3, P<0.01 vs control).

In the present study, we demonstrated the ability of apoptosis-related protein (APR)-2 to trigger cell death via mechanism mediated by both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [as evidenced by the increase of intracellular Ca(2+) release, the activation of both, inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) and calpain and cleavage of caspase-4] and mitochondrial dysregulation as evidenced by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, Cytochrome c release and cleavage of caspases-9 and -3, and poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP). Also, the activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK) 1, c-jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the transcription factors AP-1 and p53, and the induction of Bax expression were noted in APR-2-expressing cells. Both immune fluorescence staining and western blotting revealed the localization of APR-2 at ER and Bax protein at both mitochondria and ER. However, data of inhibitory experiments demonstrated that APR-2-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells is mediated by three parallel pathways: one of them IRE1/tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2/ASK1/JNK/Cyt.c/caspase-9/caspase-3/PARP) seems to be mitochondrial dependent, whereas, the other two pathways namely calpain/caspase-4/caspase-9/caspase-3/PARP and protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase/ATF4/C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)/Bim seem to be mitochondrial independent.

To gain an understanding of its mechanism of action, the effects of ipilimumab on T-cell populations and on humoral immune responses were studied in patients with advanced melanoma from 2 phase II trials. Antibody levels against 5 tumor antigens were assessed at baseline and up to 12 weeks after ipilimumab treatment. Serologic reactivity to the cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1 increased by at least 5-fold at week 12 of treatment in 10% to 13% of patients. Increased antibody levels were also observed to the tumor antigens Melan-A, MAGE-A4, SSX2, and p53. Immunocompetence was evaluated with tetanus boosters administered before ipilimumab and pneumococcal and influenza vaccines given 5 days after ipilimumab treatment. At week 7, most patients who received ipilimumab and vaccine showed greater humoral responses relative to baseline titers. For peripheral T-cell populations, statistically significant increases in the percent of activated (HLA-DR) CD4 and CD8 T cells with concomitant decreases in naive CD4 and CD8 T cells were observed after ipilimumab treatment. These changes were evident by week 4 of treatment. Increases were also observed in central memory, effector memory, and activated ICOS CD4 T cells, but not in ICOS CD8 T cells or in FoxP3 CD4 regulatory T cells.

Moreover, we found that p33ING2 promoted Bax translocation to mitochondria, altered the mitochondrial membrane potential, and induced cytochrome c release and thus the activation of caspases 9 and 3. In addition, we showed that under non-stress conditions p33ING2 upregulates Fas expression and activates caspase 8.

C>T and CC>TT changes make up the overwhelming majority of single base substitutions (SBS) in MM DNA, as both precursor melanocytes and melanocytic lesions have incurred incidental exposures to sunlight. To study the mutagenic mechanisms by which acute sunburn accelerates MM, we sequenced the exomes of spontaneous and neonatal UVB-induced Cdk4-R24C::Tyr-NRASQ61K mouse MMs. UVR-induced MMs carried more SBSs than spontaneous MMs, but the levels of genomic instability, reflected by translocations and copy number changes, were not different. C>T/G>A was the most common SBS in spontaneous and UVR-induced MMs, only modestly increased in the latter. However, they tended to occur at the motif A/GpCpG (reflecting C>T transition due to spontaneous deamination of cytosine at CpG) in spontaneous MMs, and T/CpCpC/T (reflecting the effects of pyrimidine dimers on either side of the mutated C) in UVR-induced MMs. Unlike MMs associated with repetitive exposures, we observed no CC>TT changes. In addition, we also found UVR 'footprints' at T>A/A>Ts (at NpTpT) and T>C/A>G (at CpTpC). These footprints are also present in MMs from a chronic UVR mouse model, and in some human MMs, suggesting that they may be minor UVR signature changes. We found few significantly somatically mutated genes (~6 per spontaneous and 15 per UVR-induced melanoma) in addition to the Cdk4 and NRAS mutations already present. Trp53 was the most convincing recurrently mutated gene; however, in the UVR-induced MMs no Trp53 mutations were at C>T/G>A, suggesting that it was probably mutated during tumour progression, not directly induced by UVR photoproducts. The very low load of recurrent mutations convincingly induced by classical UVB-induced dimer photoproducts may support a role for cell extrinsic mechanisms, such as photoimmunosuppression and inflammation in driving MM after acute UVB exposure.

However, T-oligo has limited stability in vivo due to serum and intracellular nucleases. To develop T-oligo as an innovative, effective therapeutic drug and to understand its mechanism of action, we investigated the antitumor effects of T-oligo or T-oligo complexed with a novel cationic alpha helical peptide, PVBLG-8 (PVBLG), in a p53 null melanoma cell line both in vitro and in vivo. The uptake of T-oligo by MM-AN cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis indicated that the T-oligo-PVBLG nanocomplex increased uptake by 15-fold. In vitro results showed a 3-fold increase in MM-AN cell growth inhibition by the T-oligo-PVBLG nanocomplex compared with T-oligo alone. Treatment of preformed tumors in immunodeficient mice with the T-oligo-PVBLG nanocomplex resulted in a 3-fold reduction in tumor volume compared with T-oligo alone. This reduction in tumor volume was associated with decreased vascular endothelial growth factor expression and induction of thrombospondin-1 expression and apoptosis. Moreover, T-oligo treatment downregulated procaspase-3 and procaspase-7 and increased catalytic activity of caspase-3 by 4-fold in MM-AN cells. Furthermore, T-oligo induced a 10-fold increase of senescence and upregulated the melanoma tumor-associated antigens MART-1, tyrosinase, and thrombospondin-1 in MM-AN cells, which are currently being targeted for melanoma immunotherapy. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p73 (4-10-fold) abolished this upregulation of tumor-associated antigens. In summary, we suggest a key role of p73 in mediating the anticancer effects of T-oligo and introduce a novel nanoparticle, the T-oligo-PVBLG nanocomplex, as an effective anticancer therapeutic. ",

The present study was designed to understand the effect of this mycotoxin on melanoma cells (B16F10) by measuring cell proliferation and assessing the anti-tumour effect in vivo in Balb/c mice. Our results revealed that intraperitoneally administration of PAT for 20 days significantly induces tumour regression in B16F10 cell-implanted mice. This effect was evidenced by the activation of apoptosis which is supported by the increase in p53 and Bax expressions, the downregulation of the protein levels of Bcl2, and the increase in caspase-3 activity. Moreover, systemic toxicity analysis demonstrated that there is no potential toxicity following PAT treatment unlike untreated melanoma mice which suffer from anaemia, inflammation and liver dysfunction.

With the use of 2-D PAGE and MALDI-Q-TOF MS and MS/MS analyses, proteomic profiles of A375 cells between control and kojic acid treatment were compared, and 30 differentially expressed proteins, containing 2 up-regulated proteins and 28 down-regulated proteins, were identified.

Sixteen differentially expressed proteins exhibited interaction network linked to the downstream regulations of p53 tumor suppressor and cell apoptosis, which may lead to suppress the melanogenesis and tumorigenesis of kojic acid treated A375 cells. In addition, GRP75, VIME and 2AAA were validated by Western blot analysis, whereas GRP75, 2AAA, HS90B, ENPL and KPYM were validated by RT-PCR.

AS101 (ammonium trichloro(dioxoethylene-0,0')tellurate), a synthetic immunomodulator with minimal toxicity, was found to have antitumor effects in various tumor models. Our present study shows that AS101 has direct and indirect effects on tumor cells; AS101 inhibits the clonogenicity of B16 melanoma cells in vitro. Moreover, wild-type P53 expression, which is required for induction of Apo-1 expression, increased significantly in AS101-treated cells. We therefore investigated Fas expression in AS101-treated B16 cells and found that Fas, but not FasL, expression was significantly increased; moreover, Fas receptors were functional. Longer incubation with AS101 resulted in spontaneous apoptosis triggered by the Fas-FasL system. To explore the relationship of these results to the antitumor effects of AS101, we injected B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice carrying the lpr mutation in the Fas gene and to gld mutant mice that lack functional FasL. Tumor development in control groups was lowest in the lpr mice, while no difference was observed between gld and wild-type mice. Among the AS101-treated groups, the most pronounced effect appeared in the lpr mice, while the lowest was seen in the gld mutant mice.

Besides, the number and constitution of FMGS and ARs differed greatly among different cancers and stages. In addition, FMGS and ARs were rare in endocrine-related cancers such as breast carcinoma, ovarian cystadenocarcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma, but abundant in cancers contact directly with external environments such as skin melanoma and stomach adenocarcinoma.

Characteristic chromosomal abnormalities are common and include 6p gain, associated with a good prognosis, as well as 1p loss, 3 loss, and 8q gain, which correlate with high mortality. These are identified by techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridisation, comparative genomic hybridisation, microsatellite analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

Moreover, statins inhibited the prenylation of Rho as well as the phosphorylation of LIM kinase, serum response factor (SRF), and c-Fos downstream of the Rho signaling pathway. In addition, statins enhanced p53, p21, and p27 expression and reduced phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase and expression of cyclin D1 and E2.

New sequencing technologies, in particular next generation sequencing, have led to a better and more comprehensive understanding of malignant tumors.

Here we report that PHGDH, the key metabolic enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the serine biosynthesis pathway, is a target of p53 in human melanoma cells. p53 suppresses PHGDH expression and inhibits de novo serine biosynthesis. Notably, upon serine starvation, p53-mediated cell death is enhanced dramatically in response to Nutlin-3 treatment. Moreover, PHGDH has been found recently to be amplified frequently in human melanomas. We found that PHGDH overexpression significantly suppresses the apoptotic response, whereas RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous PHGDH promotes apoptosis under the same treatment. These results demonstrate an important role of p53 in regulating the serine biosynthesis pathway through suppressing PHGDH expression and reveal serine deprivation as a novel approach to sensitize p53-mediated apoptotic responses in human melanoma cells.

Sequence analysis of the wt1 cDNA expressed by melanoma cell line WM 902-B revealed the presence of 4 previously published splice variants but no evidence for mutations in the coding region.

Based on these findings, we studied the relationship of wt1 and PDGF-A chain gene expression in melanoma cell lines. Co-expression of the wt1 and the PDGF-A chain genes was observed in 2 melanoma cell lines with mutated p53 but not in 2 melanoma cell lines with wild-type p53; this result is consistent with a previous report showing that, in the context of absent or mutated p53, WT1 acts as a transcriptional activator, whereas in the presence of wild-type p53 it acts as a repressor.",

In recent years, molecular diagnosis in dermatopathology has benefited from a vast array of advances in the fields of genomics and proteomics. Sensitive techniques are available for detecting specific DNA and RNA sequences by molecular hybridization. This paper intends to update methods of molecular cytogenetics available as diagnostic adjuncts in the field of MM. Cytogenetics has highlighted the pathogenesis of atypical melanocytic neoplasms with emphasis on the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway during the initiation step of the neoplasms. 20 to 40% of MM families have mutations in the tumour suppressor gene p16 or CDKN2A. In addition, somatic mutations in p16, p53, BRAF, and cKIT are present in MM. Genome-wide scan analyses on MM indicate positive associations for genes involved in melanocytic naevi, but MM is likely caused by a variety of common low-penetrance genes. Molecular dermatopathology is expanding, and its use in the assessment of melanocytic neoplasms appears to be promising in the fields of research and diagnosis. Molecular dermatopathology will probably make its way to an increased number of diagnostic laboratories. The expected benefit should improve the patient management. This evolution points to a need for evolution in the training requirements and role of dermatopathologists.",

Forty-four spots were identified by PMF/MALDI-TOF, 15 with increased and 29 with decreased protein levels.

Decreases of > or = twofold in GST, superoxide dismutase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin 2, and peroxiredoxin 6 protein were observed. SAGE indicated the reduction of other proteins involved in ROS degradation. As expected, the accumulation of exogenous peroxides was significantly higher in the tumor cells while the levels of glutathionylation were two times lower in the tumor cells compared to melan-a.

The ERK1/2-MAPK pathway is critical for cutaneous melanoma development and consequently an important therapeutic target. Defining the contribution of ERK1/2-MAPK signalling to UM development has been hampered by the lack of an informative animal model that spontaneously develops UM. Towards this end, we engineered transgenic zebrafish to express oncogenic GNAQQ209P in the melanocyte lineage. This resulted in hyperplasia of uveal melanocytes, but with no evidence of malignant progression, nor perturbation of skin melanocytes. Combining expression of oncogenic GNAQQ209P with p53 inactivation resulted in earlier onset and even more extensive hyperplasia of uveal melanocytes that progressed to UM. Immunohistochemistry revealed only weak immunoreactivity to phosphorylated (p)ERK1/2 in established uveal tumours-in contrast to strong immunoreactivity in oncogenic RAS-driven skin lesions-but ubiquitous positive staining for nuclear Yes-associated protein (YAP). Moreover, no changes were observed in pERK1/2 levels upon transient knockdown of GNAQ or phospholipase C-beta (PLC-β) inhibition in the majority of human UM cell lines we tested harbouring GNAQ mutations. In summary, our findings demonstrate a weak correlation between oncogenic GNAQQ209P mutation and sustained ERK1/2-MAPK activation, implying that ERK1/2 signalling is unlikely to be instrumental in the maintenance of GNAQQ209P-driven UMs.",

To clarify and confirm the function of CD36 (glycoprotein IV) as a TSP receptor, we now describe a transfected cell model using human melanoma cells genetically manipulated by sense or antisense cDNA transfection to express either high or near zero levels of CD36. Surface expression was confirmed by flow cytometry with monoclonal anti-CD36 IgG and quantified by measuring radiolabeled antibody binding. Bowes melanoma cells, which in their wild type did not express CD36 and did not bind radiolabeled TSP, when transfected with the sense construct bound TSP in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with CD36 expression. Conversely, C32 melanoma cells, which in their wild type expressed high levels of CD36 and bound radiolabeled TSP at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, did not express CD36 and did not bind TSP when transfected with an antisense construct. In addition, transfected Bowes cells and wild type C32 cells, unlike wild type Bowes cells, adhered to activated platelets in a TSP-dependent manner. These data, i.e. the gain of function with sense cDNA transfection and loss of function with antisense transfection, strongly support the TSP receptor function of CD36.

In all cases, including TMZ-resistant cells, PHA-848125 IC(50) values were significantly below the maximum plasma concentrations achievable in the clinic. In the most PHA-848125-sensitive cell line, the drug caused a concentration-dependent G(1) arrest. PHA-848125 also impaired phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein at CDK2 and CDK4 specific sites, decreased retinoblastoma protein and cyclin A levels, and increased p21(Cip1), p27(Kip1) and p53 expression. Combined treatment with fixed ratios of TMZ plus PHA-848125 was studied in three melanoma cell lines. PHA-848125 was added to the cells 48 h after TMZ and cell growth was evaluated after 3 additional days of culture. Parallel experiments were performed in the presence of O(6)-benzylguanine (BG), to prevent repair of methyl adducts at O(6)-guanine induced by TMZ. Drug combination of TMZ plus BG and PHA-848125 produced additive or synergistic effects on cell growth, depending on the cell line. In the absence of BG, the combination was still more active than the single agents in the cell line moderately sensitive to TMZ, but comparable to PHA-848125 alone in the two TMZ-resistant cell lines. When TMZ plus BG were used in combination with PHA-848125 against cultured normal melanocytes, neither synergistic nor additive antiproliferative effects were observed.

In this study, the cell cycle dependence of p53 accumulation and pRb hypophosphorylation in four human melanoma cell lines that are wild type for p53 was investigated using two-parameter flow cytometry measurements of p53 or pRb protein content and DNA content. The hypoxia-induced increase in p53 protein was higher in S-phase than in G1 and G2 phases in all cell lines. The accumulation of p53 in S-phase during hypoxia was not related to hypoxia-induced apoptosis or substantial cell cycle specific cell inactivation during the first 24 h of reoxygenation. pRb was hypophosphorylated in all cell cycle phases by hypoxia treatment. The results did not support a direct link between p53 and pRb during hypoxia because p53 was induced in a cell cycle-specific manner, whereas no cell cycle-dependent differences in pRb hypophosphorylation were detected. Only a fraction of the cell populations (0.60+/-0.10) showed hypophosphorylated pRb. Thus, pRb is probably not the only mediator of the hypoxia-induced cell cycle block seen in all cells and all cell cycle phases.

In human melanocytes, persistent BRAF(V600E) expression triggers oncogene-induced senescence, which implies that bypass of oncogene-induced senescence is necessary for malignant transformation of melanocytes. We show that a subpopulation of primary human melanocytes with persistent expression of BRAF(V600E) do not enter oncogene-induced senescence, but instead survive despite heightened MAPK activity. Disruption of the p53 pathway using short-hairpin RNA initiated rapid growth of these V600E(+) melanocytes in vitro. The resultant V600E(+)/p53(sh) melanocytes grew anchorage-independently in soft agar, formed pigmented lesions reminiscent of in situ melanoma in artificial skin reconstructs, and were weakly tumorigenic in vivo. Array comparative genomic hybridization analysis demonstrated that the transformed melanocytes acquired a substantial deletion in chromosome 13, which encodes the Rb1 tumor suppressor gene. Gene expression profiling study of nevi and melanomas showed that p53 target genes were differentially expressed in melanomas compared with nevi, suggesting a dysfunctional p53 pathway in melanoma in vivo. In summary, these data demonstrate that a subpopulation of melanocytes possesses the ability to survive BRAF(V600E)-induced senescence, and suggest that p53 inactivation may promote malignant transformation of these cells.",

The present study aims to investigate the anti-cancer effect of Centratherum anthelminticum (L.) seeds chloroform fraction (CACF) on human melanoma cells and to elucidate the molecular mechanism involved.;A chloroform fraction was extracted from C. anthelminticum (CACF). Bioactive compounds of the CACF were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Human melanoma cell line A375 was treated with CACF in vitro. Effects of CACF on growth inhibition, morphology, stress and survival of the cell were examined with MTT, high content screening (HSC) array scan and flow cytometry analyses. Involvement of intrinsic or extrinsic pathways in the CACF-induced A375 cell death mechanism was examined using a caspase luminescence assay. The results were further verified with different caspase inhibitors. In addition, Western blot analysis was performed to elucidate the changes in apoptosis-associated molecules. Finally, the effect of CACF on the NF-κB nuclear translocation ability was assayed.;The MTT assay showed that CACF dose-dependently inhibited cell growth of A375, while exerted less cytotoxic effect on normal primary epithelial melanocytes. We demonstrated that CACF induced cell growth inhibition through apoptosis, as evidenced by cell shrinkage, increased annexin V staining and formation of membrane blebs. CACF treatment also resulted in higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lower Bcl-2 expression, leading to decrease mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Disruption of the MMP facilitated the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, which activates caspase-9 and downstream caspase-3/7, resulting in DNA fragmentation and up-regulation of p53 in melanoma cells. Moreover, CACF prevented TNF-α-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation, which further committed A375 cells toward apoptosis.;Together, our findings suggest CACF as a potential therapeutic agent against human melanoma malignancy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Exposition of the skin with solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) is the main cause of skin cancer development. The consistently increasing incidences of melanocytic and nonmelanocytic skin tumors are believed to be at least in part associated with recreational sun exposure. Epidemiological data indicate that excessive or cumulative sunlight exposition takes place years and decades before the resulting malignancies arise. The most important defense mechanisms that protect human skin against UV radiation involve melanin synthesis and active repair mechanisms. DNA is the major target of direct or indirect UV-induced cellular damage. Low pigmentation capacity in white Caucasians and rare congenital defects in DNA repair are mainly responsible for protection failures. The important function of nucleotide excision DNA repair (NER) to protect against skin cancer becomes obvious by the rare genetic disease xeroderma pigmentosum, in which diverse NER genes are mutated. In animal models, it has been demonstrated that UVB is more effective to induce skin cancer than UVA. UV-induced DNA photoproducts are able to cause specific mutations (UV-signature) in susceptible genes for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). In SCC development, UV-signature mutations in the p513 tumor suppressor gene are the most common event, as precancerous lesions reveal approximately 80% and SCCs > 90% UV-specific p53 mutations. Mutations in Hedgehog pathway related genes, especially PTCH1, are well known to represent the most significant pathogenic event in BCC. However, specific UV-induced mutations can be found only in approximately 50% of sporadic BCCs. Thus, cumulative UVB radiation can not be considered to be the single etiologic risk factor for BCC development. During the last decades, experimental animal models, including genetically engineered mice, the Xiphophorus hybrid fish, the south american oppossum and human skin xenografts, have further elucidated the important role of the DNA repair system in the multi-step process of UV-induced melanomagenesis. An increasing body of evidence now indicates that nucleotide excision repair is not the only DNA repair pathway that is involved in UV-induced tumorigenesis of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. An interesting new perspective in DNA damage and repair research lies in the participation of mammalian mismatch repair (MMR) in UV damage correction. As MMR enzyme hMSH2 displays a p53 target gene, is induced by UVB radiation and is involved in NER pathways, studies have now been initiated to elucidate the physiological and pathophysiological role of MMR in malignant melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer development.",

The mechanism of survivin up-regulation in the course of melanocyte transformation and its repression in normal melanocytes, however, has not been clearly defined. We show here that p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb), at basal levels and in the absence of any activating stimuli, are both required to repress survivin transcription in normal human melanocytes. Survivin repression in melanocytes does not involve alterations in protein stability or promoter methylation. p53 and Rb (via E2Fs) regulate survivin expression by direct binding to the survivin promoter; p53 also affects survivin expression by activating p21. We demonstrate a novel role for E2F2 in the negative regulation of survivin expression. In addition, we identify a novel E2F-binding site in the survivin promoter and show that mutation of either the p53- or E2F-binding sites is sufficient to increase promoter activity.

IL-1Ra was capable of attenuating the expression of Fas-ligand (Fas-L) and the cleavage of procaspas-8 and -3 caused by evodiamine. Subsequently, IL-1Ra reduced evodiamine-induced DNA degradation, p53 activation and up-regulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. However, IL-1Ra attenuated the enhanced phosphorylation level of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) without affecting extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) inactivation induced by evodiamine. In conclusion, IL-1-induced death cascade in melanoma A375-S2 cell might be one of the targets for natural product evodiamine, and increased Fas-L expression via IL-1 mediated pathway stands at the initiation phase, leading to consequent events that culminate in the death of the cells.",

Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed, followed by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction. Furthermore, the functional modules of the PPI network were screened using BioNet analysis tool. Finally, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis was performed for DEGs in the module.;In total, 794 upregulated transcripts corresponding to 214 genes and 977 downregulated transcripts corresponding to 325 genes were screened. The downregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in pathways such as cell cycle, DNA replication, and p53 signaling pathway.

Two M14 melanoma cell clones obtained by transfection and expressing six to ten times lower c-Myc protein levels than the parental cells and the control clone were employed. Analysis of survival curves demonstrates an increase in CDDP sensitivity in c-Myc low-expressing clones if compared with the control clone and the parental line. The enhanced sensitivity is unrelated to the impairment in enzymatic DNA repair activity. Cell cycle analysis demonstrates that although the control clone is able to completely recover from the CDDP-induced S-G(2)/M block, this arrest is prolonged in c-Myc low-expressing clones and a fraction of cells undergoes apoptosis. Although no changes in P53, Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-x(L/S) protein levels are observed, apoptosis is associated with the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activation of caspase-1, caspase-3 and cleavage of the specific caspase substrate poly-ADP-ribose polymerase. The use of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine and caspase inhibitors prevents CDDP-induced apoptosis in c-Myc low-expressing clones, demonstrating that ROS, caspase-1, and caspase-3 are required for apoptotic cell death. Moreover, ROS generation depends on caspase-1-like activation because the Ac-YVAD-cho inhibitor abrogates CDDP-induced ROS in the c-Myc low-expressing clones.",

Chromatin remodeling complexes such as the SWI/SNF complex are involved in making DNA accessible to transcription factors and thereby are implicated in the regulation of gene expression. Mutations and altered expression of chromatin remodeling complex genes have been described in cancer cells. Indeed, non-small cell lung cancer cell lines have been shown to harbor mutations in SMARCA4 (BRG1), a member of the SWI/SNF complex, but evidence has been less clear in primary tumors. Recently, inactivating mutations in AT-rich interaction domain 2 (ARID2) were found in liver cancer related to HCV infection and in melanoma. Here, we explored, using a genome-wide strategy and subsequent sequencing of targeted genes, whether chromatin remodeling is implicated in primary lung adenocarcinoma. Two genes were individualized from the genome screening as homozygously deleted in a set of samples: JARID2 and ARID2. Subsequent analysis of the entire coding sequences showed that ARID2 loss-of-function mutations were found in 5% of nonsmall cell lung cancers, thereby constituting one of the most frequently mutated genes in this cancer type after TP53, KRAS, EGFR, CDKN2A and STK11.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Ultraviolet radiation (UV) is considered as a key environmental risk factor of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), but other factors such as immunological status, genetic predisposition and infection by human papillomavirus (HPV) may also be involved. Although there is overwhelming epidemiological and molecular evidence that indicates a direct role for specific mucosal HPV-types in anogenital cancers, in particular cervical cancer, the pathogenic role of HPV in the development of NMSC remains speculative. The association between HPV and NMSC was first identified in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) and later in recipients of organ transplants. All these patients develop NMSC at sun-exposed sites. Cutaneous and mucosal HPV-DNA have been detected in about 60 to 90 p. 100 of NMSC, but also in benign epithelial lesions, and even in normal skin. However and although at a lower rate (about 40 p. 100), HPV-DNA have also been detected in normal skin, in particular in hair follicles, and in premalignant lesions and in NMSC from non-EV and immunocompetent subjects. Furthermore, no particular HPV type predominates and the viral load in NMSC seems lower than in benign epithelial lesions. Although all these findings argue against a direct involvement of HPV in NMSC, they may suggest a \"hit and run\" mechanism which no longer requires the viral agent but the activity of HPV oncoproteins. High risk mucosal HPV-types encode two major oncoproteins, E6 and E7, which inactivate two suppressor proteins, p53 and pRb respectively, and are sufficient for host-cell immortalization. A polymorphism resulting in either a proline or an arginine at codon 72 may also be a relevant risk factor for mucosal HPV-types-associated NMSC. By contrast, E6 of skin HPV-types fails to interact with p53, but prevents infected cells from UV-induced apoptosis leading thus to the propagation of deleterious UV-induced mutations. Immunosuppressive activities of HPV E6 and E7 proteins permit persistent HPV infection and the impairment of immunologic removal of UV-damaged cells. These results support a role for HPV infection in skin carcinogenesis as a co-factor in association with UV and immunosuppression.",

Aberrant expression of class I MAGE proteins occurs in melanomas and many other malignancies, and MAGE proteins have long been recognized as tumor-specific targets; however, their functions have largely been unknown. Here, we show that suppression of class I MAGE proteins induces apoptosis in the Hs-294T, A375, and S91 MAGE-positive melanoma cell lines and that members of all three families of MAGE class I proteins form complexes with KAP1, a scaffolding protein that is known as a corepressor of p53 expression and function. In addition to inducing apoptosis, MAGE suppression decreases KAP1 complexing with p53, increases immunoreactive and acetylated p53, and activates a p53 responsive reporter gene. Suppression of class I MAGE proteins also induces apoptosis in MAGE-A-positive, p53wt/wt parental HCT 116 colon cancer cells but not in a MAGE-A-positive HCT 116 p53-/- variant, indicating that MAGE suppression of apoptosis requires p53. Finally, treatment with MAGE-specific small interfering RNA suppresses S91 melanoma growth in vivo, in syngenic DBA2 mice. Thus, class I MAGE protein expression may suppress apoptosis by suppressing p53 and may actively contribute to the development of malignancies and by promoting tumor survival. Because the expression of class I MAGE proteins is limited in normal tissues, inhibition of MAGE antigen expression or function represents a novel and specific treatment for melanoma and diverse malignancies.",

Surprisingly, co-knockdown of p27(Kip1) or cyclin E1 failed to prevent the tetraploid arrest induced by Skp2 knockdown. Enhanced Aurora A phosphorylation and repression of G2/M regulators cyclin B1, cyclin-dependent kinase 1, and cyclin A indicated a G2/early M phase arrest in Skp2-depleted cells. Furthermore, expression of nuclear localized cyclin B1 prevented tetraploid accumulation after Skp2 knockdown. The p53 status is most frequently wild type in melanoma, and the tetraploid arrest and down-regulation of G2/M regulatory genes were strongly dependent on wild-type p53 expression. In mutant p53 melanoma lines, Skp2 depletion did not induce cell cycle arrest despite up-regulation of p27(Kip1). These data indicate that elevated Skp2 expression may overcome p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoints in melanoma cells and highlight Skp2 actions that are independent of p27(Kip1) degradation.",

These mutations lead to increased telomerase expression, allowing cells to proliferate continuously without entering apoptosis or senescence. Atypical fibroxanthomas and pleomorphic dermal sarcomas are genetically poorly understood tumors developing in the skin of older patients. Known genetic events in these tumors are mutations in TP53 (atypical fibroxanthoma and pleomorphic dermal sarcoma) and RAS (pleomorphic dermal sarcoma) genes, often having a UV signature. We analyzed a cohort of 27 atypical fibroxanthomas and 34 pleomorphic dermal sarcomas for the presence of TERT promoter mutations by conventional Sanger sequencing. TERT promoter mutations were identified in 25 (93%) atypical fibroxanthomas and in 26 (76%) pleomorphic dermal sarcomas. Mutations were found to have a UV signature (C>T or CC>TT) and were largely identical to those detected in cutaneous melanoma. Our data show that TERT promoter mutations are the most frequent mutations in atypical fibroxanthomas and pleomorphic dermal sarcomas reported to date. The identified mutations confirm the pathogenetic role of UV exposure in both atypical fibroxanthomas and pleomorphic dermal sarcomas and suggest that telomere maintenance through increased expression of telomerase plays an important role in the pathogenesis of these tumors.

Here, we characterize the role of p16/Rb in coordinating the early events in UVB-irradiated skin. Foreskins and melanoma cell cultures were irradiated with low and high acute UVB doses and examined for cell-cycle- and apoptosis-associated genes. In melanoma cells, low UVB dose upregulated p16, p53, and p21 expression levels in Malme-3M, and high UVB dose accentuated the expression of p53 and p21(Cip1/Waf1), in particular; however, in SkMel-28 cells only p16 expression was upregulated in response to UV irradiation. In HaCaT cells, high UVB dose caused dramatic increase in p53 expression followed by upregulation of p21(Cip1/Waf1) and Bax, and downregulation of Bcl-2 leading to apoptosis. In HaCaT cells, reinstatement of p16 pathway restored cell-cycle arrest in response to low dose. Foreskin organ culture experiments confirmed our in vitro cell results. These data indicate that the p53 and p16 pathways respond independently to UVB insult. The p16 pathway is favored at low doses and results in cell-cycle arrest; the p53 pathway is more responsive to higher doses and induces apoptosis depending on p53 mutation status.",

In this study, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of the mitotic inhibitor paclitaxel on three melanoma cell lines with differing sensitivity to the BRAF inhibitor. Of the two BRAF inhibitor-resistant cell lines, A375P/Mdr cells harboring the BRAF V600E mutant were resistant and the wild-type BRAF SK-MEL-2 cells were sensitive to paclitaxel. In particular, paclitaxel caused the growth inhibition of SK-MEL-2 cells to a much greater extent than it caused growth inhibition of A375P cells. Paclitaxel exhibited no significant effect on the phosphorylation of MEK-ERK in any cell lines tested, regardless of both the BRAF mutation and the drug resistance, implying that paclitaxel activity is independent of MEK-ERK inhibition. In A375P cells, paclitaxel treatment resulted in a marked emergence of apoptotic cells after mitotic arrest, concomitant with a remarkable induction of p21(Cip1). However, paclitaxel only moderately increased the levels of p21(Cip1) in A375P/Mdr cells, which exhibited a strong resistance to paclitaxel. The p21(Cip1) overexpression partially conferred paclitaxel sensitivity to A375P/Mdr cells. Interestingly, we found an extremely low background expression level of p21(Cip1) in SK-MEL-2 cells lacking normal p53 function, which caused much greater G2/M arrest than that seen in A375P cells. Taken together, these results suggest that paclitaxel may be an effective anticancer agent through regulating the expression of p21(Cip1) for the treatment of BRAF mutant melanoma cells resistant to BRAF inhibitors.

The combination of recombinant human fibroblast interferon (IFN-beta) and the antileukemic compound mezerein (MEZ) results in an irreversible loss of proliferative capacity and terminal cell differentiation in H0-1 human melanoma cells. In contrast, either agent alone induces reversible growth arrest and/or specific components of the differentiation process without inducing terminal differentiation. The current study investigates changes in cell cycle, cell cycle gene expression and E2F transcription factor complex formation during the processes of reversible and irreversible (terminal) differentiation. Induction of both terminal differentiation and reversible differentiation (MEZ treatment) results in a temporal decrease in DNA synthesis and the percentage of cells in S phase and a decrease in the expression of cell cycle and growth regulated genes, including cdc2, cyclin A, cyclin B, histone H1, histone H4, nm23-H1, p53 and c-myc. Persistent gene expression changes occur in terminally differentiated cells, but not in reversibly differentiated cells. H0-1 cells contain several E2F binding activities, including uncomplexed E2F, an E2F-p107-cyclin A-cdk2 kinase complex and an Rb-E2F complex. Induction of growth arrest by MEZ results in a slow migrating gelshift band that contains E2F associated with the pRb2/p130 protein. There is also a loss of the Rb-E2F complex. Induction of terminal differentiation after treatment with IFN-beta + MEZ generates a second pRb2/p130-E2F complex that migrates considerably faster than the pRb2/p130-E2F complex resulting from growth arrest. The slower migrating complex may contribute to growth arrest, whereas the faster migrating complex may play a role in terminal differentiation. Our results demonstrate that terminal cell differentiation involves a co-ordinate and continuous suppression of a number of cell cycle and growth related genes and results in the development of a novel E2F transcription factor complex not apparent in growth arrested and reversibly differentiated human melanoma cells.",

On the other hand, the sinonasal region is a significant site for Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV)-related tumors, including sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma or malignant lymphoma. Twenty-three sinonasal small round cell tumors (SSRCT) comprising 5 sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas, 9 olfactory neuroblastomas and 9 malignant melanomas were evaluated for the presence of EBV infection by in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA, combined with immunostaining for EBV-related proteins (LMP-1 and EBNA2). Furthermore, 55 SSRCT comprising 37 sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas, 9 olfactory neuroblastomas, and 9 malignant melanomas were examined for the presence of cytokeratins (AE1/ AE3 and CAM5.2), S-100 protein and p53 protein using immunohistochemical staining. According to in situ hybridization for detecting EBV-encoded RNA 1 (EBER1), all of the sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas showed clear, intense hybridization signals localized over the nuclei of the tumor cells and, in 3 out of 9 (33.3%) malignant melanomas, hybridization signals were also recognized. However, none of the olfactory neuroblastomas revealed hybridization signals. Immunohistochemically, 4 out of 5 (80%) sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas were positive for LMP-1, whereas only 2 out 9 (22.2%) malignant melanomas and no olfactory neuroblastomas were positive. With regard to EBNA2, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas, malignant melanomas and olfactory neuroblastomas were all negative. Out of 37 sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas 35 (94.6%) showed a diffuse positive immunoreaction for AE1/AE3, whereas neither olfactory neuroblastoma nor malignant melanoma revealed a positive reaction. All 9 malignant melanomas and 6 out of 9 olfactory neuroblastomas (75%) were positive for S-100 protein, whereas only 6 cases of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas (19.4%) were positive. As for p53 protein, 16 of 37 sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas (43.2%) were positive, whereas neither olfactory neuroblastoma nor malignant melanoma revealed any positive reaction. The above results suggest that EBV infection is closely associated with sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas, and that some malignant melanomas may also have a relationship with its infection. For the differential diagnosis of SSRCT, it is important to evaluate EBV infection along with immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratins and S-100 protein. The overexpression of p53 protein was found to be related to the oncogenesis of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma; however, there was no association between its overexpression and malignant melanoma or olfactory neuroblastoma.",

A flow cytometric assay was performed to detect expression of viable cells, cell cycles, reactive oxygen species production, levels of [Formula: see text] and caspase activity. A Western blotting assay and confocal laser microscope examination were performed to detect expression of protein levels. In the in vitro studies, we found that casticin induced morphological cell changes and DNA condensation and damage, decreased the total viable cells, and induced G2/M phase arrest. Casticin promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreased the level of [Formula: see text], and promoted caspase-3 activities in A375.S2 cells. The induced G2/M phase arrest indicated by the Western blotting assay showed that casticin promoted the expression of p53, p21 and CHK-1 proteins and inhibited the protein levels of Cdc25c, CDK-1, Cyclin A and B. The casticin-induced apoptosis indicated that casticin promoted pro-apoptotic proteins but inhibited anti-apoptotic proteins. These findings also were confirmed by the fact that casticin promoted the release of AIF and Endo G from mitochondria to cytosol. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) assay showed that casticin inhibited the NF-[Formula: see text]B binding DNA and that these effects were time-dependent. In the in vivo studies, results from immuno-deficient nu/nu mice bearing the A375.S2 tumor xenograft indicated that casticin significantly suppressed tumor growth based on tumor size and weight decreases. Early G2/M arrest and mitochondria-dependent signaling contributed to the apoptotic A375.S2 cell demise induced by casticin. In in vivo experiments, A375.S2 also efficaciously suppressed tumor volume in a xenotransplantation model. Therefore, casticin might be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of skin cancer in the future. ",

By using length polymorphisms in restriction fragments and simple sequence repeats, or \"microsatellites,\" markers on each autosome were analyzed for allele losses in tumor DNAs. Losses of heterozygosity on chromosome 11 were observed at several loci surrounding the p53 tumor-suppressor gene (Trp53) in 12 of 17 mammary tumors and 2 of 8 lung tumors. Although most of these alterations appeared to result from nondisjunction, at least two examples of somatic recombination or deletion were also observed. Southern analysis revealed a homozygous deletion of the remaining Trp53 allele of one of these mammary tumors. Losses of heterozygosity were also detected at the Rb-1 tumor-suppressor gene in 7 of 17 mammary tumors and 1 lung tumor. Finally, frequent allele losses were observed on chromosome 4 in lung tumors. Analysis of nine chromosome 4 loci defined an interstitial deletion containing the Ifa gene cluster in one of the lung tumors. A tumor-suppressor gene was previously mapped to this region of chromosome 4 in studies with somatic cell hybrids. In addition, homozygous deletions have been reported in a homologous region of human chromosome 9p for acute lymphocytic leukemias, glioblastomas, melanomas, and lung carcinomas.

We now investigated whether human melanoma survival in response to sodium nitroprusside (SNP) is modulated by: (a) stable introduction of a DN-mutant p53; (b) pharmacologically inhibiting ERK activation with UO126; (c) addition of exogenous SOD. Nitroprusside releases nitric oxide (NO) when intact, or acts in a NO-independent manner via iron and residual cyanide after light exposure (lex-SNP). When tested at 300 microM in 72 h treatments by cytometric live-dead assays, intact SNP caused a 50% lethality versus a 30% lethality induced by lex-SNP. No protection from SNP toxicity was seen when inhibiting the PI3-kinase pathway with LY294002 or c-Jun NH(2) kinase signaling with SP600125. However, pretreatment with UO126 protected from SNP-mediated cell death including counteracting apoptosis-associated Bax expression and PARP cleavage, plus reversing loss of Cu,Zn-SOD. Moreover, addition of exogenous SOD also protected cells from SNP toxicity. In spite of the greater earlier effects of intact SNP, cells treated with single doses of either intact or lex-SNP, revealed about a 90% mortality in longer 120 h treatments, and these were also counteracted by UO126 or exogenous SOD. This report is the first to show that: constitutive ERK activation characteristic of cancer cells, increases a nitroprusside-induced apoptosis modulated by SOD.",

After gamma-ray irradiation of 6 Gy, a peak of WAF1 accumulation was observed at 6 h in SK-Mel-26, G361 and HM6KO cells, and at 3 h in MeWo cells. In MeWo and SK-Mel-26 cells, the X-ray-induced WAF1 accumulation was decreased by PK inhibitors, GF (PKC inhibitor) or H89 (PKA inhibitor); this did not occur in G361 and HM6KO. In all the cell lines, accumulation of WAF1 induced by X-ray irradiation was suppressed by H7 (PKC and PKA inhibitor).

The links between cancer migratory behavior and DNA damage are poorly understood.;Using 3D collagen systems to recapitulate melanoma extracellular matrix, we analyzed the relationship between the actomyosin cytoskeleton of migrating cells and DNA damage. We used multiple melanoma cell lines and microarray analysis to study changes in gene expression and in vivo intravital imaging (n = 7 mice per condition) to understand how DNA damage impacts invasive behavior. We used Protein Tissue Microarrays (n = 164 melanomas) and patient databases (n = 354 melanoma samples) to investigate the associations between markers of DNA damage and actomyosin cytoskeletal features. Data were analyzed with Student's and multiple t tests, Mann-Whitney's test, one-way analysis of variance, and Pearson correlation. All statistical tests were two-sided.;Melanoma cells with low levels of Rho-ROCK-driven actomyosin are subjected to oxidative stress-dependent DNA damage and ATM-mediated p53 protein stabilization. This results in a specific transcriptional signature enriched in DNA damage/oxidative stress responsive genes, including Tumor Protein p53 Inducible Protein 3 (TP53I3 or PIG3). PIG3, which functions in DNA damage repair, uses an unexpected catalytic mechanism to suppress Rho-ROCK activity and impair tumor invasion in vivo. This regulation was suppressed by antioxidants. Furthermore, PIG3 levels decreased while ROCK1/2 levels increased in human metastatic melanomas (ROCK1 vs PIG3; r = -0.2261, P < .0001; ROCK2 vs PIG3: r = -0.1381, P = .0093).;The results suggest using Rho-kinase inhibitors to reactivate the p53-PIG3 axis as a novel therapeutic strategy; we suggest that the use of antioxidants in melanoma should be very carefully evaluated.",

Two of these loss-of-function mutants were analyzed for genetic defects in ONC-Xmrk's. In the lof-1 mutant a novel transposable element, TX-1, has jumped into ONC-Xmrk, leading to a disruption of the gene and a truncated protein product lacking the carboxyterminal domain of the receptor tyrosine kinase. TX-1 is obviously an active LTR-containing retrotransposon in Xiphophorus that was not found in other fish species outside the family Poeciliidae. Surprisingly, it does not encode any protein, suggesting the existence of a helper function for this retroelement. In the lof-2 mutant the entire ONC-Xmrk gene was found to be deleted.

The function of antiproliferative genes and the induction of programmed cell death are among the potential differences between these growth-arrest mechanisms. Specifically, an inverse relation between the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) and the susceptibility to apoptosis has been reported. To test this relation, we examined the features of growth arrest in a canine melanoma cell line, TLM1. Both contact inhibition and serum deprivation halted cell-cycle progression of TLM1 cells in the G1 phase. Prolonged growth arrest of the cells without restimulation resulted in apoptosis; conversely, the cells reentered the cell cycle after release from contact inhibition or on restimulation with serum. Cell-to-cell contact, but not serum deprivation, led to the expression of p53 and p21/Waf-1. The expression of p21/Waf-1 did not prevent apoptosis. Moreover, the ectopic overexpression of CDKIs increased apoptosis. These results support the premise that growth arrest induced by contact inhibition and serum deprivation are mediated through distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, CDKIs are not universal inhibitors of apoptosis, and in some cases, they may initiate or enhance the apoptotic program.",

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin is a major complication of treatment with these drugs, with a 65 to 100-fold higher risk than in the normal population. By contrast, the incidence of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the other major keratinocyte-derived tumour of the skin, of melanoma and of internal malignancies increases to a significantly lesser extent. Here we report that genetic and pharmacological suppression of calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) function promotes tumour formation in mouse skin and in xenografts, in immune compromised mice, of H-ras(V12) (also known as Hras1)-expressing primary human keratinocytes or keratinocyte-derived SCC cells. Calcineurin/NFAT inhibition counteracts p53 (also known as TRP53)-dependent cancer cell senescence, thereby increasing tumorigenic potential. ATF3, a member of the 'enlarged' AP-1 family, is selectively induced by calcineurin/NFAT inhibition, both under experimental conditions and in clinically occurring tumours, and increased ATF3 expression accounts for suppression of p53-dependent senescence and enhanced tumorigenic potential. Thus, intact calcineurin/NFAT signalling is critically required for p53 and senescence-associated mechanisms that protect against skin squamous cancer development.",

Mutations in NRAS, BRAF, and Tp53 have been described in individual CMN samples; however, their role in the pathogenesis of multiple CMN within the same subject and development of associated features has not been clear. We hypothesized that a single postzygotic mutation in NRAS could be responsible for multiple CMN in the same individual, as well as for melanocytic and nonmelanocytic central nervous system (CNS) lesions. From 15 patients, 55 samples with multiple CMN were sequenced after site-directed mutagenesis and enzymatic digestion of the wild-type allele. Oncogenic missense mutations in codon 61 of NRAS were found in affected neurological and cutaneous tissues of 12 out of 15 patients, but were absent from unaffected tissues and blood, consistent with NRAS mutation mosaicism. In 10 patients, the mutation was consistently c.181C>A, p.Q61K, and in 2 patients c.182A>G, p.Q61R. All 11 non-melanocytic and melanocytic CNS samples from 5 patients were mutation positive, despite NRAS rarely being reported as mutated in CNS tumors. Loss of heterozygosity was associated with the onset of melanoma in two cases, implying a multistep progression to malignancy.

        "Doc_abstract":"Skin cancers, both non-melanoma and melanoma, usually progress through sequential steps towards malignant transformation, leading to mutant clones and precancerous lesions. Prevention of skin cancers relies on reduction of exposure to solar radiation and may be evaluated by measuring induction of intermediate-effect biomarkers such as sunburn cells or p53 mutations in the epidermis, actinic (solar) keratoses, UV-induced immunosuppression or naevi. Sunburn cells (apoptotic keratinocytes) and p53 mutations are indicators of UV-induced DNA lesions as early steps of malignant transformation of epidermal keratinocytes. Actinic keratoses are premalignant sun-induced skin lesions, characterized as keratinized patches with aberrant cell differentiation and proliferation; they represent risk factors for basal-cell carcinoma and melanoma and are precursors of squamous-cell carcinoma. Studies in humans have investigated UV-induced immunosuppression and its modulation by topical sunscreen application, focusing on contact hypersensitivity as measured by immunization or response to haptens, or on modulation of stimulation of allogeneic lymphocytes by epidermal cells, or local release of immunomodulatory molecules such as cis-urocanic acid or interleukin-10. Naevi are focal collections of melanocytes, usually found at the junction of the epidermis and dermis or at various depths in the dermis. Common acquired naevi arise after birth both spontaneously and in response to sun exposure. Most acquired naevi are clonal, while most melanocytes in non-naeval areas are not. Although it is not yet certain whether naevi represent premalignant lesions or risk factors, many melanomas arise in acquired naevi, and the number of naevi constitutes the best predictor of individual risk of melanoma. The presence of large (i.e., >5 mm) or atypical naevi (i.e., large naevi with non-uniform colour and irregular borders) is associated with elevated melanoma risk, independently of the number of smaller naevi. Children seem particularly vulnerable to sun-induced biological events involved in the genesis of melanoma, and the greatest increase in naevus numbers per unit of skin surface occurs before adolescence. Therefore, the distribution of naevi and their development in children are relevant to understanding melanoma occurrence in adults.",

We now developed a method based on DOPA oxidase in-gel detection and Sypro Ruby fluorometric normalization to investigate induction of specific DOPA oxidase isoforms in response to hydrogen peroxide-mediated stress, and to ask whether this is associated with p53-dependent adaptive responses. This report shows that hydrogen peroxide leads to comparable induction of 60 and 55 kDa DOPA oxidases in poorly pigmented B16 melanoma, in contrast to sole induction of a major 55 kDa DOPA oxidase in their highly pigmented counterparts. In the latter cells, this response also increases p53 concomitant with joint induction of p53-activated proteins like the cell-cycle inhibitor p21WAF1 and pro-apoptotic bax, with no comparable effect on expression of anti-apoptotic bcl-2. Together, these data suggest that response to hydrogen peroxide involves p53-mediated growth-restrictive signaling and unequal induction of specific DOPA oxidases in melanocytic cells with unequal basal pigmentation.",

In this study, it was found that evodiamine has a strong inductive effect on NO production synthesized by inducible NOS (iNOS) enzyme in a positive-feedback manner. The generated NO was further showed to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and linked to the activation of p53 and p21.

        "Doc_abstract":"The use of live bacteria in the treatment of cancer has a long and interesting history. We report the use of a purified bacterial redox protein, azurin, that enters human cancer (melanoma UISO-Mel-2) cells and induces apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis occurs readily in melanoma cells harboring a functional tumor suppressor protein p53, but much less efficiently in p53-null mutant melanoma (UISO-Mel-6) cells. A redox-negative mutant form of azurin (M44K/M64E) demonstrates much less cytotoxicity to the UISO-Mel-2 cells than the wild-type protein. Azurin has been shown to be internalized in UISO-Mel-2 cells and is localized predominantly in the cytosol and in the nuclear fraction. In the p53-null UISO-Mel-6 cells, azurin is localized only in the cytosol. Thus, intracellular trafficking of azurin to the nucleus is p53-dependent. Azurin forms a complex with p53, thereby stabilizing it and raising its intracellular level in cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear fractions. Corresponding to an increasing level of p53, an inducer of apoptosis, the level of Bax also increases in mitochondria, allowing significant release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol, thus initiating the onset of apoptosis. The M44K/M64E mutant form of azurin, deficient in cytotoxicity, is also deficient in forming a complex with p53 and is less efficient in stabilizing p53 than wild-type azurin. Azurin has been shown to allow regression of human UISO-Mel-2 tumors xenotransplanted in nude mice and may potentially be used in cancer treatment.",

In order to establish a reproducable model system for studying the exact mechanisms conferring chemoresistance, we selected drug-resistant sublines in vitro derived from one parental human melanoma (MeWo) cell line. Four commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs (vindesine, etoposide, fotemustine, cisplatin) with different modes of action were choosen and stable sublines exhibiting four different levels of resistance against each drug were selected by continuous exposure over two years. Analysis of the drug-resistant sublines regarding their pharmacological characteristics and cross-resistance pattern revealed an up to 26-fold increased relative resistance against the alkylating agent fotemustine (MeWoFOTE) and an up to 35.7-fold increased relative resistance against topoisomerase-II-inhibiting etoposide (MeWoETO). Cisplatin selection (MeWoCIS) resulted in a 6-fold higher resistance compared to parental MeWo cells, whereas vindesine exposure (MeWoVIND) increased relative resistance up to 10.2-fold. Sublines selected separately for resistance to the DNA-damaging agents fotemustine, cisplatin and etoposide demonstrated strong cross-resistance. In comparison to the parental cell line drug-resistant sublines showed altered expression patterns of proto-oncogenes. Levels of p53 mRNA decreased with increasing resistance to vindesine, etoposide and fotemustine. Expression of bcl-2 family members (bax, bcl-x) was modulated by fotemustine, etoposide and cisplatin. In addition the expression of members of the fos (c-fos) and jun (c-jun, jun-D) gene family encoding transcription factors of the AP-1 complex was altered in all drug-resistant sublines. The pattern of expression varied with the inducing stimulus and this was paralleled by changes in the transactivation potential of AP-1. Our results reinforce the central role of AP-l in drug resistance probably through its participation in a programmed cellular stress response.",

The aim of the present study was to identify a simple yet robust method for isolating, preserving and staining cells that could be analysed by flow cytometry.;Using a simple preparation procedure, a panel of membrane-associated antibodies (ICAM-1, W632, HLA-DR) and nuclear or cytoplasmic oncoprotein antibodies (c-erbB-2, c-myc, bcl-2, p53), together with positive (PHM-5) and negative (FITC F(ab')2) controls, were assayed. It was considered important to test the protocol with markers expressed on the cell surface, and in the cytoplasm and nucleus, so as not to be restrictive and thereby exclude an antigen of potential clinical interest. In addition, such panels would also enable the generation of a 'phenotypic profile' for each specimen that may reveal clinically significant trends.;Our results indicate that tissue dissociation followed by brief fixation in 1% paraformaldehyde and permeabilisation in 70% methanol produces a stable single cell suspension, which can subsequently be stained with a wide range of antibodies for the accurate identification of cells in a potentially heterogeneous tumour population.;This technology can rapidly identify sub-populations of cells expressing differing levels of proteins, which may prove to be indicative of disease progression for this aggressive disease.",

Melanocytes, including uveal melanocytes, are derived from the neural crest during embryonic development. We therefore suggested that PTP4A3 function in uveal melanoma metastasis may be related to an embryonic role during neural crest cell migration. We show that PTP4A3 plays a role in cephalic neural crest development in Xenopus laevis. PTP4A3 loss of function resulted in a reduction of neural crest territory, whilst gain of function experiments increased neural crest territory. Isochronic graft experiments demonstrated that PTP4A3-depleted neural crest explants are unable to migrate in host embryos. Pharmacological inhibition of PTP4A3 on dissected neural crest cells significantly reduced their migration velocity in vitro. Our results demonstrate that PTP4A3 is required for cephalic neural crest migration in vivo during embryonic development. ",

To maintain genomic integrity, cells are equipped with dedicated sensors to monitor DNA repair or to force damaged cells into death programs. The tumor suppressor p53 is central in this process. Here, we report that the ubiquitous transcription factor Upstream Stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) coordinates p53 function in making proper cell fate decisions. USF1 stabilizes the p53 protein and promotes a transient cell cycle arrest, in the presence of DNA damage. Thus, cell proliferation is maintained inappropriately in Usf1 KO mice and in USF1-deficient melanoma cells challenged by genotoxic stress. We further demonstrate that the loss of USF1 compromises p53 stability by enhancing p53-MDM2 complex formation and MDM2-mediated degradation of p53. In USF1-deficient cells, the level of p53 can be restored by the re-expression of full-length USF1 protein similarly to what is observed using Nutlin-3, a specific inhibitor that prevents p53-MDM2 interaction. Consistent with a new function for USF1, a USF1 truncated protein lacking its DNA-binding and transactivation domains can also restore the induction and activity of p53. These findings establish that p53 function requires the ubiquitous stress sensor USF1 for appropriate cell fate decisions in response to DNA-damage. They underscore the new role of USF1 and give new clues of how p53 loss of function can occur in any cell type. Finally, these findings are of clinical relevance because they provide new therapeutic prospects in stabilizing and reactivating the p53 pathway.",

Melanoma risk is also determined by susceptibility genes, one of which is the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene. Certain MC1R alleles are strongly associated with melanoma. We hereby present experimental evidence for the role of two melanoma risk factors, constitutive pigmentation, as assessed by total melanin, eumelanin and pheomelanin contents, and MC1R genotype and function, in determining the induction and repair of DNA photoproducts in cultured human melanocytes after irradiation with increasing doses of UVR. We found that total melanin and eumelanin contents (MC and EC) correlated inversely with the extent of UVR-induced growth arrest, apoptosis and induction of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), but not with hydrogen peroxide release in melanocytes expressing functional MC1R. In comparison, melanocytes with loss-of-function MC1R, regardless of their MC or EC, sustained more UVR-induced apoptosis and CPD, and exhibited reduced CPD repair. Therefore, MC, mainly EC, and MC1R function are independent determinants of UVR-induced DNA damage in melanocytes.",

The current standard of care is visual inspection by physicians and/or dermatologists, followed by skin biopsy and pathologic confirmation. We have investigated the use of in vivo fluorescence imaging using fluorocoxib A as a molecular probe for early detection and assessment of skin tumors in mouse models of NMSC. Fluorocoxib A targets the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme that is preferentially expressed by inflamed and tumor tissue, and therefore has potential to be an effective broadly active molecular biomarker for cancer detection. We tested the sensitivity of fluorocoxib A in a BCC allograft SCID hairless mouse model using a wide-field fluorescence imaging system. Subcutaneous allografts comprised of 1000 BCC cells were detectable above background. These BCC allograft mice were imaged over time and a linear correlation (R(2) = 0.8) between tumor volume and fluorocoxib A signal levels was observed. We also tested fluorocoxib A in a genetically engineered spontaneous BCC mouse model (Ptch1(+/-) K14-Cre-ER2 p53(fl/fl)), where sequential imaging of the same animals over time demonstrated that early, microscopic lesions (100 μm size) developed into visible macroscopic tumor masses over 11 to 17 days. Overall, for macroscopic tumors, the sensitivity was 88% and the specificity was 100%. For microscopic tumors, the sensitivity was 85% and specificity was 56%. These results demonstrate the potential of fluorocoxib A as an in vivo imaging agent for early detection, margin delineation and guided biopsies of NMSCs. ",

We sought to characterize this cell line with respect to the effect of TAM resistance on a variety of different intracellular cell cycle control and apoptotic pathways. A TAM-resistant variant cell line (289 TAMs) was developed and the technique of Western analysis was to determine the changes in protein expression that occurred as a result of the development of TAM resistance. In this model, TAM resistance resulted in an increase in the detectable basal levels of cyclin E, GADD 153, p16, BAX, Bcl-XL, and wild-type and mutant p53, an increase in TAM induction of p16, and a decrease in the detectable basal levels of cyclin D1, p21 and p27. There were no detectable changes in the levels of pRb. In the TAM-resistant variant, p21 levels were essentially undetectable, while p27 was present and maintained its response to TAM Induction, albeit at a much lower level. This investigation demonstrates that the development of TAM resistance is associated with a change in the detectable levels of a variety of cell cycle control and apoptosis-related proteins. While the exact role that each change plays in the development of tamoxifen resistance remains to be determined, these data suggest that the development of resistance to a particular agent results in changes in multiple, seemingly unrelated pathways.

        "Doc_abstract":"The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a transcription factor activated by phosphorylation of its N-terminus. MDM2, encoded by a p53-activated gene, acts as a negative-feedback regulator of p53 by promoting p53 degradation. Moreover, MDM2 inhibits p53 by binding to and concealing its N-terminal transcription-activating domain. p53 can be activated by nutlin-3a, a molecule designed to bind MDM2 and prevent its interaction with p53. Actinomycin D promotes phosphorylation and accumulation of p53 via a mechanism that involves high expression of MDM2. We hypothesized that co-treatment of cells with actinomycin D and nutlin-3a would lead to synergistic activation of p53 by stimulating kinases and preventing accumulated MDM2 from binding to p53. Indeed, co-treatment of various cell lines with actinomycin D and nutlin-3a resulted in a synergistic increase of p53 phosphorylation on serine 46. We focused on this residue because it is a marker of the highest level of p53 activation. Co-treatment was associated with conspicuous decrease in a marker of mTOR activity in NCI-H28 cells and very strong activation of p53 targets, including CDKN1A and PML, in A549 cells. Other p53 target genes (SESN1, SESN2, TIGAR, DRAM1) were also efficiently upregulated; however, a marker of apoptosis (active caspase-3) appeared only in some cancer cell lines (e.g., A375 and other cell lines derived from melanoma) indicating that phosphorylation of p53 on serine 46 is not straightforwardly associated with induction of apoptosis. Moreover, our data suggest that melanoma may be a suitable target for drug combination used in this study. ",

Alterations in the p53 gene were much more abundant, as illustrated immunohistochemically by the accumulation of p53 protein in 75% of the tumor sections examined. Immunoreactivity was observed primarily in the proliferative cell compartment, but no clear correlation between p53 staining in tumor cells and histological parameters for malignancy was observed. Subsequent sequence analysis showed that point mutations in the p53 gene are detectable in 30% (nine out of 30) of the skin tumors examined. The majority of the mutations are located in codons 267 and 272, most likely originating from UV-B-induced photo-adducts at dipyrimidine sites in the non-transcribed strand. Codon 272 corresponds to the human codon 278, which is also a hotspot for p53 mutations in human non-melanoma skin cancers. Codon 267 matches the human codon 273, which does not contain a dipyrimidine site, but represents a CpG hotspot for p53 mutations in internal malignancies.

The present study was designed to investigate the effect of BA and UV-C (254 nm) on cultured congenital melanocytic naevi (CMN) cells, using the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay to detect DNA damage. Exposure to UV light induced a 1.7-fold increase in CMN cells (P = 0.008) when compared with controls. When a p53 genetic suppressor element that encodes a dominant negative polypeptide (termed GSE56) was introduced into the CMN cells, the transfected cells were more sensitive to UV-induced DNA breakage.

Pretreatment with BA (3 microm) for 48 h resulted in a 25.5% reduction in UV-induced DNA breakage in the CMN cells (P = 0.023), but no changes were observed in the transfected cells. However, Western blot analysis revealed no changes in the p53 or p21 levels in BA-treated cells, suggesting that BA might mediate its action via a non-p53 pathway.

Once senescence is overcome, the nevus can exhibit dysplastic features and readily progress to more lethal stages. Recent advances have convincingly demonstrated that senescence represents a true barrier to the progression of many types of cancer, including melanoma. Thus, understanding the mechanism(s) by which melanoma evades senescence has become a priority in the melanoma research community. Senescence in most cells is regulated through some combination of activities within the RB and p53 pathways. However, differences discovered among various tumor types, some subtle and others quite profound, have revealed that senescence frequently operates in a context-dependent manner.

Members of the PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathway, including these proteins and mTOR, are altered in melanoma tumors and cell lines. A hallmark of activation of the pathway is the loss of function of PTEN. Indeed, loss of heterozygosity of PTEN has been observed in approximately 30% of human melanomas, implicating this signaling pathway in this cancer. PI3K signaling activation, via loss of PTEN function, can inhibit proapoptotic genes such as the FoxO family of transcription factors, while inducing cell growth- and cell survival-related elements such as p70S6K and AKT. Determining how the PI3K-PTEN-AKT signaling pathway, alone or in cooperation with other pathways, orchestrates the induction of target genes involved in a diverse range of activities is a major challenge in research into melanoma initiation and progression.

However, it still fails to eradicate hypoxic tumors due to the occurrence of radioresistance. Therefore, the search for new radiation sensitizers is of great significance. Platinum (Pt) complexes have been identified as potential radiation sensitizers to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to radiotherapy. In the present study, we have synthesized four Pt complexes containing (2 - benzimidazole [4, 5-f] - [1, 10] phenanthroline) ligand and found that they could effectively enhance the X-ray-induced growth inhibition against A375 human melanoma cells through induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest. In contrast, they showed much lower cytotoxicity toward human normal cells. The complexes also dramatically inhibited the TrxR activity and caused intracellular ROS overproduction, due to the Auger electron effect of heavy metal element under X-ray radiation. Excessive ROS triggered DNA damage and activated downstream signaling pathways, including the phosphorylation of p53 and p38MAPK, and down-regulation of phosphorylated AKT and ERK, finally resulted in increase of radiosensitivity and inhibition of tumor reproduction. Taken together, our results suggest that the synthetic Pt complexes could be further developed as sensitizers of X-ray radiotherapy. ",

A subset of highly homologous MAGE genes (group A; MAGE-A) belong to the chromosome X-clustered cancer/testis antigens. MAGE-A genes are normally expressed in the human germ line and overexpressed in various tumor types; however, their biological function is largely unknown. Here we present evidence indicating that MageA2 protein, belonging to the MAGE-A subfamily, confers wild-type-p53-sensitive resistance to etoposide (ET) by inducing a novel p53 inhibitory loop involving recruitment of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to MageA2/p53 complex, thus strongly down-regulating p53 transactivation function. In fact, enhanced MageA2 protein levels, in addition to ET resistance, correlate with impaired acetylation of both p53 and histones surrounding p53-binding sites. Association between MAGE-A expression levels and resistance to ET treatment is clearly shown in short-term cell lines obtained from melanoma biopsies harboring wild-type-p53, whereas cells naturally, or siRNA-mediated expressing low MAGE-A levels, correlate with enhanced p53-dependent sensitivity to ET. In addition, combined trichostatin A/ET treatment in melanoma cells expressing high MAGE-A levels reestablishes p53 response and reverts the chemoresistance.",

Since transition metal complexes including those of Ru(III), show important anticancer activity with limited toxicity, we investigated the potential antitumor efficacy of Ru(II) complexed to KTZ or clotrimazole (CTZ) compared to Ru(II) alone or uncomplexed azoles. RuCl2(KTZ)2 exerted greater apoptosis- associated caspase-3 activation than RuCl2(CTZ)2, KTZ, CTZ or RuCl2(MeCN)4 against several human tumor cell monolayers. PARP cleavage and a decrease in S+G2 cells were evident after RuCl2(KTZ)2 treatment in genetically matched C8161 melanoma monolayers with unequal p53 functional status. Release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and Mn-SOD suggest mitochondria as a target of RuCl2(KTZ)2. Treatment of WM164 melanoma monolayers with 25 microM of cisplatin or RuCl2(KTZ)2 showed that the latter is more effective than cisplatin at inducing PARP fragmentation and proapoptotic Bak expression. Such results suggest that these Ru(II) and Pt(II) metal complexes are unequally effective and act through alternative signaling pathways. In studies with multicellular spheroids, which frequently are more resistant to cytotoxic anticancer drugs than monolayers, those from wt p53 C8161 melanoma underwent PARP fragmentation in response to RuCl2(KTZ)2. In contrast, spheroids of mut p53 A431 carcinoma overexpressing EGF receptor were resistant to either RuCl2(KTZ)2 or anti-EGF receptor C225 MAb. However, joint treatment with both agents restored growth arrest and apoptosis in these spheroids. In contrast to the antitumor action of cisplatin, which is known to be hampered by p53 dysfunction, we show that RuCl2(KTZ)2 is active irrespective of p53 functional status against several adherent tumor cells and synergizes with anti-EGF receptor C225 MAb to kill tumor spheroids resistant to either agent.",

The revertants exhibited a significant but variable degree of phenotypic reversion, according to the selective pressure to which they were submitted, and a phenotypic stability dependent on their constant maintenance in selective medium. Back-revertant lines were isolated by culturing revertant lines in control medium for several weeks.

However, whether MCAM conversely regulates YAP remains unknown. The aim of the current study was to demonstrate whether and how MCAM regulates YAP in HCC cells. The present study demonstrated that MCAM has a positive effect on the regulation of YAP activity and expression. Mechanistically, MCAM stimulated YAP transcription through its downstream effector c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimer. Gain and loss of function analysis by the present study indicated that c-Jun/c-Fos is capable of inducing cAMP response element-binding protein activation, which is a transcription factor that directly binds to the YAP promoter. Finally, it was identified that an impaired transformative phenotype in MCAM- or c-Jun/c-Fos-depleted HCC cells could be partially rescued by simultaneous overexpression of YAP, suggesting that YAP may function as a downstream effector of the MCAM-c-Jun/c-Fos signaling pathway.

The activity was neutralized by anti-IL-1 alpha antibody but not by anti-IL-1 beta antibody. Resistant cells expressed IL-1 alpha but not IL-1 beta mRNA. Therefore, the resistant cells appeared to produce IL-1 alpha mRNA for IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) was not detected in resistant cells, indicating that the resistance is not attributable to IL-1Ra. These resistant cells were also resistant to the anti-proliferative effect of human IL-6, but not to that of human TNF. Resistant cells appeared to produce constitutively IL-6 more than sensitive cells, and IL-6 production both in sensitive and in resistant cells was augmented by exogenous IL-1. Furthermore, constitutive production of IL-6 in resistant cells was inhibited by IL-1Ra. Type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) mRNA was expressed equally in resistant and sensitive cells.

A prominent in vivo model of the senescence barrier is represented by nevi, which are composed of melanocytes that, after an initial phase of proliferation induced by activated oncogenes (most commonly BRAF), are blocked in a state of cellular senescence. Transformation to melanoma occurs when genes involved in controlling senescence are mutated or silenced and cells reacquire the capacity to proliferate. Pirin (PIR) is a highly conserved nuclear protein that likely functions as a transcriptional regulator whose expression levels are altered in different types of tumors. We analyzed the expression pattern of PIR in adult human tissues and found that it is expressed in melanocytes and has a complex pattern of regulation in nevi and melanoma: it is rarely detected in mature nevi, but is expressed at high levels in a subset of melanomas. Loss of function and overexpression experiments in normal and transformed melanocytic cells revealed that PIR is involved in the negative control of cellular senescence and that its expression is necessary to overcome the senescence barrier.

Nevus cell aggregates (NCAs) can mimic foci of metastatic carcinoma or other disease processes, so the surgical pathologist should be familiar with this lesion. The purpose of this report is to describe the potential diagnostic difficulties created by benign NCAs within the thymus of a 32-year-old man with dysplastic nevus syndrome and malignant melanoma involving mediastinal lymph nodes and the right lung. Morphologically, the NCAs in this case elicited the differential diagnoses of metastatic melanoma and thymoma. Immunohistochemical studies helped to establish the correct diagnosis by demonstrating reactivity for S-100 protein and negative staining for keratin and HMB-45. Unlike malignant melanomas, NCAs show no p53 protein immunoreactivity, and low proliferative activity was detected by Ki-67 antigen immunostaining. Although melanocytic cells were rarely reported in thymic neoplasms, we are not aware of any previous reports of NCAs occurring in the normal thymus.",

We have recently shown that human CD4 T cells engineered to express a human melanoma-associated antigenic epitope, MART-127-35, specific MHC class I-restricted transgenic TCR function as polyfunctional effectors that can exhibit a helper as well as cytolytic effector function, in an epitope-specific and MHC class I-restricted manner (Chhabra et al. 2008. J. Immunol. 181: 1063-1070; Ray et al. 2010. Clin. Immunol. 136: 338-347). TCR-engineered (TCReng) CD4 T cells therefore have translational potential, and clinical trials with MHC class I TCReng CD4 T cells are under way. In this study, we show that although TCReng CD4 T cells could be useful in cancer immunotherapy, they are also susceptible to epitope-specific activation-induced cell death (AICD). We also show that the AICD in TCReng CD4 T cells is a death receptor-independent process and that JNK and p53 play critical roles in this process as pharmacological inhibitors targeting JNK activation and p-53-mediated transcription-independent mitochondria-centric death cascade rescued a significant fraction of TCReng CD4 T cells from undergoing AICD without affecting their effector function. Our data offer novel insights toward AICD in TCReng CD4 T cells and identify several potential targets to interfere with this process. ",

Appearance at birth or later of a nodular or hyperpigmented area within a CMN simulates malignant melanoma and prompts biopsy. Although their clinical and pathologic features seem ominous, proliferative nodules (PNs) typically are benign and may regress, although atypical features cause greater concern. Here we report clinical and pathologic findings with outcome in 10 children who had multiple biopsies of large CMN with PNs. We reviewed 78 separate samples from the 10 patients and classified the 60 PNs according to published criteria. A subset of 30 samples containing both the CMN and a PNs was analyzed for immunohistochemical reactivity for melanocytic (S-100 protein, HMB45, melan-A), lymphocytic (CD45), cell-cycle/proliferative (Mib-1, p16, p21, p27, c-Myc), apoptotic (p53, Bax, c-kit, CD95), and anti-apoptotic (bcl-2) markers. Both CMN and PNs had similar expression of melanocytic, lymphocytic, and most cell-cycle/proliferative and apoptotic markers, including Mib-1, p16, p21, p27, c-Myc, Bax, CD95, and bcl-2. A greater proportion of PNs than CMN were reactive for p53 (67% vs. 30%, P < 0.0098) and c-kit (97% vs. 3%, P < 0.0001). p53 and p21 expression in CMN and all types of PNs were inversely correlated. When ordinary and atypical PNs were compared, the atypical PNs more frequently expressed p53, Mib-1, Bax, and bcl-2, but less frequently expressed p21. The c-kit expression in nearly all PNs and its absence in nearly all CMN is potentially useful for recognition of PN, suggests a delayed melanocytic maturation process in proliferative nodules, and may be likely indicative of their benign nature. p53 reactivity in concert with a lack of p21 up-regulation by immunohistochemistry suggests that a p53 mutation may be present in PN, although the immunohistochemical findings alone cannot exclude possible overexpression of wild-type p53. Regressive, involutional, or maturational changes were observed in sequential samples from 4 patients. No patient developed malignant melanoma or another melanocytic nevus-associated malignancy during the follow-up period. These findings underscore the similarities between PNs and the underlying CMN and suggest that maturational, proliferative, and apoptotic processes are involved in their clinical evolution.",

MAGE proteins promote tumor survival by binding to the RBCC region of KAP-1 and suppressing p53. Although, suppression of MAGE expression, by RNA interference, relieves p53 suppression and inhibits tumor growth, its therapeutic uses are limited by lack of methods for systemic delivery of small interfering RNA. To overcome this barrier, we sought to discover chemical compounds that inhibit binding between MAGE and KAP-1 proteins. Based on previously published effects of MAGE suppression, we developed a strategy for screening a small molecule library based on selective death of MAGE positive cells, activation of p53 and lack of caspase activity. We screened the Maybridge HitFinder library of compounds and eight compounds fulfilled these criteria. Seven of these compounds interfered with co-precipitation of MAGE and KAP-1, and three interfered with binding of MAGE and KAP-1 in a mammalian two hybrid assay. We now report identification of three potential compounds that interfere with MAGE/KAP-1 binding and can be developed as novel chemo-therapeutic agents for treatment of advanced melanoma and other cancers.",

These were probes for chromosome 3p21, the p53 gene on chromosome 17p13, and, in a few selected cases, a probe for chromosome 9p21. It was demonstrated that deletions of these regions could be reliably detected and related to tumor type and histology, i.e. grading. The most common deletion was that of 3p21 which was found in all studied squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of low differentiation, in 60% of the Bowen carcinomas, in 70% of the metastatic melanomas less than 1.5 mm thick, and in over 55% of those which thickness over 2 mm. In contrast, FISH-detected p53 deletion was a rare finding in the investigated tumors. However, this gene was even found in an increased copy number in 60% of the poorly differentiated SCCs (grade 4) and in 50% of the non-metastatic melanomas less than 1.5 mm thick.

However, the antitumor properties of xanthoceraside as well as its mechanism of action remain unclear. Therefore, we proposed to investigate its potential anticancer property. In this study, the viability of cells was measured by the MTT assay. Cell cycle and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured by flow cytometry, and the expressions of procaspase-9, procaspase-3, Cyto.c, Apaf-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bad, p53, and IGF-1R/Raf/MEK/ERK were tested by Western blotting. Xanthoceraside significantly inhibited the proliferation of human melanoma A375.S2 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner but did not impair the viability of normal cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells). Further analysis revealed that xanthoceraside induced apoptosis by activating caspase-3 and caspase-9 in a time-dependent manner through the mitochondrial pathway but did not activate caspase-8 in the cells. In addition, xanthoceraside inhibited the expression of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), which is an important prosurvival, antiapoptotic signaling growth factor receptor that is frequently overexpressed in cancer cells and used as a therapeutic target for multiple cancers. Interestingly, xanthoceraside also decreased the expression of Raf, p-MEK, and p-ERK, the downstream effectors of IGF-1R. Taken together, these findings indicate that xanthoceraside induces apoptosis through a mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway, which is induced by the downregulation of IGF-1R/Raf/MEK/ERK cascades in A375.S2 cells.",

Furthermore, we have also identified the down-regulation of multiple proteasomal subunits, resulting in a significant decrease in 20S proteasome activity.

In addition, in this review I ranked known/possible risk factors extending the analysis to the hereditary pancreatitis (HP), diabetes, or to specific environmental exposures such as smoking.

For example KRAS mutations are very frequent in pancreatic cancers but relatively rare in melanomas. The opposite is true for BRAF mutations. Somatic mutations in the gene encoding for the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KCA) catalytic subunit, PIK3CA, occur at high frequency in many solid cancers. We have examined whether PI3K oncogenic mutations (exons 9 and 20) might exhibit gender and/or tissue specificity. By examining large cohorts of breast and colorectal cancers affecting both men and women we found that the pattern of PIK3CA mutations is distinctive. In colorectal cancers, PIK3CA (but not KRAS, APC, or TP53) mutations display a gender bias occurring at higher frequencies in women. We also found that male breast cancers display PIK3CA mutations at an overall frequency similar to that observed in female breast tumors. In male breast cancers, however, PIK3CA mutations are found mainly in exon 20. We conclude that PI3KCA mutations affecting exons 9 and 20 display gender- and tissue-specific patterns, thus suggesting that the different amino acid changes could exert distinct functional effects on the oncogenic properties of this enzyme. Furthermore, we propose that sexual dimorphisms and tissue specific factors might directly or indirectly influence the occurrence of PI3KCA cancer alleles.",

However, the function of GPR56 remained unclear until 2004 when mutations in the human GPR56 gene were found to cause a specific brain malformation called bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria. Although GPR56 is expressed in a wide range of tissues, the consequences of loss-of-function mutations in the GPR56 gene have only been observed in the central nervous system.

The response of c-fos, p53 and HIV-LTR reporter constructs to UVB and UVC was reduced in MM96L melanoma cells compared to HeLa. Cell cycle arrest produced by UVA, gamma radiation, cisplatin or the antimetabolite deoxyinosine differed from that of UVB. Cell cycle analysis after multiple doses of UVB raised the possibility that UVB-induced pRb depletion could result in increased mutation and thus enhanced tumourigenesis of irradiated melanocytes in skin subjected to a defined pattern of UVB exposure. To extend the analysis of gene expression in cultured melanocytic cells to uncharacterised genes, promoter trap cell clones containing unknown genes 'tagged' by a beta-galactosidase reporter construct were generated from MM96L cells. Altered gene expression in clones treated with a panel of DNA-damaging agents was quantitated by measurement of beta-galactosidase activity. Of the clones containing 'tagged' endogenous promoters induced by UVB, 52% were induced only by UVB and not by other DNA-damaging agents (cisplatin, N-methyl-N-nitro-nitrsoguanidine, fotemustine). One third of the clones were also activated by TPA suggesting that general DNA damage responses involving PKC are activated less frequently than unique pathways of gene activation. Overall, 60% of the 50 clones that responded to the panel of agents were induced by only one of the agents, indicating that a high proportion of genes are induced by agent-specific mechanisms. In the long term, promoter trapping may allow the full repertoire of UVB-inducible genes to be characterised.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The membrane bound melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), and the endothelin B receptor (ENDBR) are two G-protein coupled receptors that play important roles in constitutive regulation of melanocytes and their response to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), the main etiological factor for melanoma. The human MC1R is a Gs protein-coupled receptor, which is activated by its agonists α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-melanocortin; α-MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The ENDBR is a Gq coupled-receptor, which is activated by Endothelin (ET)-3 during embryonic development, and ET-1 postnatally. Pigmentation and the DNA repair capacity are two major factors that determine the risk for melanoma. Activation of the MC1R by its agonists stimulates the synthesis of eumelanin, the dark brown photoprotective pigment. In vitro studies showed that α-MSH and ET-1 interact synergistically in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor to stimulate human melanocyte proliferation and melanogenesis, and to inhibit UVR-induced apoptosis. An important function of the MC1R is reduction of oxidative stress and activation of DNA repair pathways. The human MC1R is highly polymorphic, and MC1R variants, particularly those that cause loss of function of the expressed receptor, are associated with increased melanoma risk independently of pigmentation. These variants compromise the DNA repair and antioxidant capacities of human melanocytes. Recently, activation of ENDBR by ET-1 was reported to reduce the induction and enhance the repair of UVR-induced DNA photoproducts. We conclude that α-MSH and ET-1 and their cognate receptors MC1R and ENDBR reduce the risk for melanoma by maintaining genomic stability of melanocytes via modulating the DNA damage response to solar UVR. Elucidating the response of melanocytes to UVR should improve our understanding of the process of melanomagenesis, and lead to effective melanoma chemoprevention, as well as therapeutic strategies.

Tumour-associated stromal cells were also less sensitive to p53-activating drugs - this effect could be reproduced in normal stromal cells by p53 knockdown.

Genetic abnormalities in CDKN2A gene have been well documented in human melanoma but their involvement in human nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and in particular in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is less clear. Several studies have shown that human SCCs harbour unique mutations in the p53 gene as well as inactivation of the CDKN2A gene. While mutations in the p53 gene are induced by UV radiation and represent tumor initiating events, the majority of alterations detected in the CDKN2A gene do not appear to be UV-dependent.

Loss-of-function mutations at the MC1R are associated with a switch from eumelanin to phaeomelanin production, resulting in a red or yellow coat colour. Activating mutations, in animals at least, lead to enhanced eumelanin synthesis. In man, a number of loss-of-function mutations in the MC1R have been described. The majority of red-heads (red-haired persons) are compound heterozygotes or homozygotes for up to five frequent loss-of-function mutations. A minority of redheads are, however, only heterozygote. The MC1R is, therefore, a major determinant of sun sensitivity and a genetic risk factor for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Recent work suggests that the MC1R also shows a clear heterozygote effect on skin type, with up to 30% of the population harbouring loss-of-function mutations. Activating mutations of the MC1R in man have not been described. The MC1R is particularly informative and a tractable gene for studies of human evolution and migration. In particular, study of the MC1R may provide insights into the lightening of skin colour observed in most European populations. The world wide pattern of MC1R diversity is compatible with functional constraint operating in Africa, whereas the greater allelic diversity seen in non-African populations is consistent with neutral predictions rather than selection. Whether this conclusion is as a result of weakness in the statistical testing procedures applied, or whether it will be seen in other pigment genes will be of great interest for studies of human skin colour evolution.",

In our previous work, we constructed the pCLPG retroviral vector where transgene expression is controlled by p53 through a p53-responsive promoter. The use of this vector to introduce p19Arf into tumor cells that harbor p53wt should yield viral expression of p19Arf which, in turn, would activate the endogenous p53 and result in enhanced vector expression and tumor suppression. Since nutlin-3 can activate p53 by blocking its interaction with mdm2, we explored the possibility that the combination of p19Arf gene transfer and nutlin-3 drug treatment may provide an additive benefit in stimulating p53 function.;B16 (mouse melanoma) and C6 (rat glioma) cell lines, which harbor p53wt, were transduced with pCLPGp19 and these were additionally treated with nutlin-3 or the DNA damaging agent, doxorubicin. Viral expression was confirmed by Western, Northern and immunofluorescence assays. p53 function was assessed by reporter gene activity provided by a p53-responsive construct. Alterations in proliferation and viability were measured by colony formation, growth curve, cell cycle and MTT assays. In an animal model, B16 cells were treated with the pCLPGp19 virus and/or drugs before subcutaneous injection in C57BL/6 mice, observation of tumor progression and histopathologic analyses.;Here we show that the functional activation of endogenous p53wt in B16 was particularly challenging, but accomplished when combined gene transfer and drug treatments were applied, resulting in increased transactivation by p53, marked cell cycle alteration and reduced viability in culture. In an animal model, B16 cells treated with both p19Arf and nutlin-3 yielded increased necrosis and decreased BrdU marking. In comparison, C6 cells were quite susceptible to either treatment, yet p53 was further activated by the combination of p19Arf and nutlin-3.;To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply both p19Arf and nutlin-3 for the stimulation of p53 activity.

We found the formation of previously unreported nuclear complexes between the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, in human melanoma cell lines induced into apoptosis following cisplatin exposure. These detergent resistant complexes were detected: after wild type (wt) p53 and Bax increased in the nucleus; at the same time when active cytoplasmic apoptosis related protease, caspase 3/CPP32 appeared; and prior to the detection of apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Three channel fluorescence laser scanning confocal image microscopy revealed that the nuclear Bax/p53 complexes remained in the nucleus and localized proximal to DNA fragmentation sites as assayed by TUNEL after cisplatin exposure. Two human melanoma cell lines, expressing wt p53, were induced into apoptosis after cisplatin exposure, however they differed in the timing of this induction. In both cell lines the formation of nuclear Bax/p53 co-immunoprecipitable complexes correlated with the timing of the induction of apoptosis. The degree of apoptosis induced by different concentrations of cisplatin correlated with the amount of nuclear Bax/p53 complexes.

Phosphorylation events have been shown to regulate the activity of the GLI transcription factors, the final effectors of the HH-GLI signaling pathway. Here, we show that WIP1 (or PPM1D), an oncogenic phosphatase amplified/overexpressed in several types of human cancer, is a positive modulator of the HH signaling. Mechanistically, WIP1 enhances the function of GLI1 by increasing its transcriptional activity, nuclear localization and protein stability, but not of GLI2 nor GLI3. We also find that WIP1 and GLI1 are in a complex. Modulation of the transcriptional activity of GLI1 by WIP1 depends on the latter's phosphatase activity and, remarkably, does not require p53, a known WIP1 target. Functionally, we find that WIP1 is required for melanoma and breast cancer cell proliferation and self-renewal in vitro and melanoma xenograft growth induced by activation of the HH signaling. Pharmacological blockade of the HH pathway with the SMOOTHENED antagonist cyclopamine acts synergistically with inhibition of WIP1 in reducing growth of melanoma and breast cancer cells in vitro. Overall, our data uncover a role for WIP1 in modulating the activity of GLI1 and in sustaining cancer cell growth and cancer stem cell self-renewal induced by activation of the HH pathway.

The reported immune responses in humans to the melanoma-associated MAGE gene products, GP100 and tyrosinase, all self-proteins, support the idea to use wild-type p53 products as targets for T cells. An important step towards this goal is identification of potential p53 CTL epitopes. We identified the wild-type p53 peptides with the highest affinity to the HLA-A*0201 molecule using two assays: the previously described MHC peptide-binding assay and the peptide competition assay.

We used a pooled RNA interference screen targeting more than 16,500 genes to discover loss-of-function events that could drive resistance to RAF inhibition. The highest ranking gene was NF1, which encodes neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor that inhibits RAS activity. NF1 loss mediates resistance to RAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors through sustained MAPK pathway activation. However, cells lacking NF1 retained sensitivity to the irreversible RAF inhibitor AZ628 and an ERK inhibitor. NF1 mutations were observed in BRAF-mutant tumor cells that are intrinsically resistant to RAF inhibition and in melanoma tumors obtained from patients exhibiting resistance to vemurafenib, thus showing the clinical potential for NF1-driven resistance to RAF/MEK-targeted therapies.",

Introduction of T-oligo, an eleven-base oligonucleotide homologous to the 3'-telomeric overhang, mimics telomere disruption and induces DNA damage responses through activation of p53, p73, p95/Nbs1, E2F1, pRb, and other DNA damage response proteins. ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) was once thought to be the primary driver of T-oligo-induced DNA damage responses; however, recent experiments have highlighted other key proteins that may also play a significant role.;To identify proteins associated with T-oligo, MM-AN cells were treated with biotinylated T-oligo or complementary oligonucleotide, cell lysates were run on SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), and the protein bands observed after treatment of cells with T-oligo or complementary oligonucleotide were analyzed using mass spectrometry. To study the effect of T-oligo on expression of hnRNP C1/C2 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1 and C2) and purine-rich element binding proteins (Pur proteins), cells were treated with T-oligo, and immunoblotting experiments were performed. To determine their role in senescence, cells were treated with shRNA (short hairpin ribonucleic acid) against these proteins, and senescence was studied using the senescence associated beta-galactosidase assay.;Using mass spectrometry, RNA-binding hnRNP C1/C2 and DNA-binding Pur proteins were found to associate with T-oligo. hnRNP C1/C2 exhibited increased expression (3.6-12.0-fold) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and in melanoma cells (4.5-5.2-fold), and Pur proteins exhibited increased expression of 2.2-fold in NSCLC and 2.0-fold in melanoma cells after T-oligo treatment. Experimental knockdown of hnRNP C1/C2 and Pur-beta completely abrogated T-oligo induced senescence in both MU melanoma and H358 NSCLC cells. Additionally, knockdown of Pur-beta prevented T-oligo-induced phosphorylation of p53, hypophosphorylation of pRb, and upregulation of E2F1, p21, and p53.;These novel findings highlight proteins essential to T-oligo's anticancer effects that may be of interest in telomere biology and cancer therapeutics.",

Changes in the cell-cycle distribution after treatment were studied using two-parameter flow cytometry in order to measure DNA content and BrdU incorporation simultaneously.;The fraction of unlabelled cells in the S-phase compartment was determined at daily intervals after treatment. Only background levels of such cells were seen in three of the cell lines (Be11, 4197, EA14). With the other three cell lines (MeWo, 4451, U87) we observed a time- and dose-dependent increase: a few days after treatment up to 20% of all cells did not incorporate BrdU. It is interesting to note that Bell, 4197 and EA14 are p53 wild-types and show a G1 block of several hours after irradiation and/or hyperthermia, while MeWo and 4451 are p53 mutants unable to exhibit such a delay, and U87 in spite of being a p53 wild-type has a reduced ability to do so.;The MeWo, 4451 and U87 cell lines have less time available for the repair of DNA damage before entering into the S-phase, which leads to problems during replication and causes some kind of interphase death.

Acquired resistance to T-cell-based immunotherapy has been associated with loss of functional beta2-microglobulin expression. This anomaly appears to be particularly relevant in tumors exhibiting a defect in DNA-mismatch repair, and induces structural abnormalities in HLA cell-surface expression that are not reversible by cytokine treatment. We examined HLA expression in 118 melanoma, colon or larynx tumors to identify total loss of HLA class I expression with or without somatic beta2-microglobulin gene mutation. Microsatellite instability was investigated in these tumors to determine whether a replication error phenotype (RER+) implied a particular alteration in HLA phenotype. A total of 7.6% of the tumors showed the RER+ phenotype, and 12.7% were HLA-ABC-negative. In the RER+ group, only one tumor was HLA-ABC-negative and no beta2-microglobulin mutation was identified. In contrast, in the HLA-ABC-negative group, only one tumor showed microsatellite instability. None of the three melanomas that contained beta2-microglobulin mutation exhibited the mutator phenotype. These findings suggest that beta2-microglobulin mutation in human melanoma tumors may arise through a mechanism that does not necessarily involve microsatellite instability. Our results also indicate that somatic mutations of the beta2-microglobulin gene are not the main mechanism of total loss of HLA expression.",

Tip110 protein plays important roles in several known physiological and pathophysiological processes, including cancers. Thus, in the present study we investigated the regulation of Tip110 expression under hypoxia. Hypoxia led to Tip110 protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Under hypoxia, Tip110 stabilized p53, which in return destabilized Tip110. In addition, Tip110 regulated hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), likely through enhancement of its protein stability. Furthermore, Tip110 upregulated p300, a known coactivator for both p53 and HIF-1α. Expression of a p53(22/23) mutant deficient in p300 binding accelerated Tip110 degradation under hypoxia. Tip110 knockdown resulted in the inhibition of cell proliferation and cell death in the presence of p53. Finally, significantly less Tip110, p53, and HIF-1α was detected in the hypoxic region of bone metastasis tumors in a mouse model of human melanoma cells. Taken together, these results suggest Tip110 is an important mediator in the cross talk between p53 and HIF-1α in response to hypoxic stress. ",

We also found that loss of the tumor suppressor p53 increased NeuroD1 expression in normal human bronchial epithelial cells and cancer cells with neuroendocrine features. Although we found that a major mechanism of action of NeuroD1 is by the regulation of TrkB, effective targeting of TrkB to inhibit invasion may depend on the cell of origin.

Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) showed a substantial enrichment of the correlated oncosuppressor genes p53, WT1, ING1, and NM23-H1 in the immunoprecipitated (IP) DNA. This suggests that NM23/NDPK binding is involved in the transcription regulation of these genes.

The association between p53 polymorphisms and HPV-associated skin cancer risk has been examined, but the results were conflicting. It was revealed that the arginine form of p53 is more susceptible to degradation by the HPV E6 protein than the proline form and that patients with the arginine form have a higher risk of developing cancer than those with the proline form. The purpose of this study was to examine whether p53 Arg at the polymorphic position 72 could represent a risk factor for patients with high risk HPV-associated malignant skin lesions. The study was conducted on 29 high risk HPV-related skin lesions from Greece. Blood samples from 61 healthy individuals were used as controls. HPV-8 was the most frequent type. There was a difference in the distribution of p53 genotypes between high risk HPV-skin lesions and the controls, and the allele frequency of p53 Arg/Arg was much higher than the controls (65.5% versus 20%). Therefore, it is suggested that p53 Arg homozygosity could represent a potential risk factor for tumorigenesis of the skin.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Therapeutic applications of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for treating various diseases have increased in recent years. To ensure that treatment is effective, an adequate MSC dosage should be determined before these cells are used for therapeutic purposes. To obtain a sufficient number of cells for therapeutic applications, MSCs must be expanded in long-term cell culture, which inevitably triggers cellular senescence. In this study, we investigated the surface markers of human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) associated with cellular senescence using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and 242 cell surface-marker antibodies. Among these surface proteins, we selected the melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM/CD146) for further study with the aim of validating observed expression differences and investigating the associated implications in hUCB-MSCs during cellular senescence. We observed that CD146 expression markedly decreased in hUCB-MSCs following prolonged in vitro expansion. Using preparative sorting, we found that hUCB-MSCs with high CD146 expression displayed high growth rates, multilineage differentiation, expression of stemness markers, and telomerase activity, as well as significantly lower expression of the senescence markers p16, p21, p53, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase, compared with that observed in hUCB-MSCs with low-level CD146 expression. In contrast, CD146 downregulation with small interfering RNAs enhanced the senescence phenotype. In addition, CD146 suppression in hUCB-MSCs caused downregulation of other cellular senescence regulators, including Bmi-1, Id1, and Twist1. Collectively, our results suggest that CD146 regulates cellular senescence; thus, it could be used as a therapeutic marker to identify senescent hUCB-MSCs.;One of the fundamental requirements for mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies is the expansion of MSCs during long-term culture because a sufficient number of functional cells is required. However, long-term growth inevitably induces cellular senescence, which potentially causes poor clinical outcomes by inducing growth arrest and the loss of stem cell properties. Thus, the identification of markers for evaluating the status of MSC senescence during long-term culture may enhance the success of MSC-based therapy. This study provides strong evidence that CD146 is a novel and useful marker for predicting senescence in human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs), and CD146 can potentially be applied in quality-control assessments of hUCB-MSC-based therapy.",

Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues from 25 samples of lentigo maligna, 20 samples of solar keratoses, and 5 samples each of normal sun-exposed and non-sun-exposed skin (controls) were immunostained with antibodies directed against the proapoptotic markers bax and p53, the antiapoptotic marker bcl-2, and the proliferation marker ki-67. Eight percent of the lentigo maligna samples were positive for keratinocyte expression of bcl-2, 24% were positive for p53, and 76% were positive for bax; respective findings for solar keratoses were 35%, 85%, and 90%. Comparison with normal sun-exposed skin yielded lower rates of keratinocyte proliferation in 56% of the lentigo maligna samples, similar rates in 36%, and higher rates in 8%; for solar keratoses, proliferation was higher than controls in 60% of samples, similar in 35%, and lower in 5%. All these differences were statistically significant. These findings indicate that there are variable patterns of epidermal reaction to chronic sun exposure.

Breast cancer studies revealed unique splicing mechanisms concerning BRCA1. In sporadic breast cancers the involvement of DNA-repair genes was proved to be dependent on the histological type. Bone-metastatic tumors have been characterized by decreased NM23 and increased c-met and p53 expressions. C-erbB2 genotype of the primary tumor was not maintained frequently in bone metastases. Application of DNA-microarray and quantitative PCR technologies improved the prediction of therapeutic sensitivity of breast cancers. Colorectal cancer studies revealed regional inhomogenities (clusters) in various geographical regions of Hungary, which were distinct in the case of colonic and rectal cancers. To increase the sensitivity of fecal blood test of colorectal cancer screening, a new double-antibody test was developed and tested in a large cohort of patients. Genetic analysis revealed that hypermethylation is a significant factor in microsatellite instability which, and plays a role in silencing of APC and E-cadherin genes as well. The Hungarian pattern of TS polymorphism was also determined and was correlated not only with the efficacy of 5-FU treatment but with the progression of the disease as well. Population-based studies have been carried out in head and neck cancer patients (HNC) and smokers as well to reveal the genetic background of increasing tumor incidence. These studies revealed polymorphism in XRCC1/3 methylation enzyme gene which has preventive role. Other studies found frequent local immunosuppression in HNC patients. Studies indicated that the success of irradiation in this cancer type is dependent on the anti-vascular effects. Pediatric cancer studies determined the parameters of neuroblastoma screening based on VMA measurements. New splice variants of the WT1 gene involved in the monitoring of MRD of ALL patients was also described this year. We also obtained positive experimental data for the retinoic acid therapy of ALL. Melanoma studies extensively used DNA-microarray technology which identified 4 melanoma-specific and 2 melanoma progression-specific genes.

Considering that patients with vitiligo have often no protective pigment in sun-exposed depigmented/white skin together with severe oxidative stress due to accumulation of millimolar epidermal hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), it would be expected that these patients develop a higher risk for early photodamage and NMSC. However, scattered reports on low patient numbers documented no increased risk for sun-induced skin cancers in this disease.;The aim of this study was to validate the possible photodamage and the development of epidermal neoplasia in a randomly selected larger patient group with emphasis on each patient's sun sensitivity and the history of solar habits. Furthermore we wished to compare histological signs for epidermal photodamage in a random representative patient group (mean age >30 years) and age-matched healthy controls.;One hundred and thirty-six randomly selected patients (females n = 93; males n = 43; mean age 42.4 years, range 14-70 years) were included in this study. To assess signs of photodamage and skin cancer, all patients underwent a thorough full-body examination by Wood's light and dermatoscopy. In order to learn about each patient's individual sun sensitivity and solar habits, a direct questionnaire was used. In addition full skin punch biopsies of sun-exposed depigmented/pigmented skin were taken under local anaesthesia and evaluated by light microscopy.;There was no evidence for sun-related damage in the entire patient group, despite a significant number of positive cases with a history of sunburns in early childhood and continuous accumulation of epidermal H(2)O(2). Histological examination of the epidermis showed no signs of increased photo-ageing and confirmed the absence of apoptosis in these patients. Furthermore surprisingly there was no increased risk for photosensitivity disorders, i.e. polymorphous light reaction, solar urticaria and acute actinic dermatitis.;The results of this study confirm in a large group of patients with vitiligo the absence of an expected high risk for sun-induced damage and skin cancer. Based on these results together with a recent report on increased functional wild-type p53 expression in these patients we would like to propose that in vitiligo there may be a direct association between this important tumour suppressor and the absence of photodamage and NMSC.",

Due to the importance of p53 in the regulation of cell growth and the relationship between p53 and ATRA, we tried to test the relationship between p53 and restin. Firstly, transfection results showed that p53 was able to upregulate the expression of restin at the transcriptional level when p53 was transfected into eukaryotic cells. Secondly, the bioinformatics analysis revealed that the upstream sequence (about 2 kb) from the first ATG of the ORF of restin gene contained a p53 binding site. In order to confirm that p53 was involved in the transcriptional regulation of restin, we cloned the upstream sequence of restin and constructed the promoter luciferase reporter system. From the luciferase activity, we demonstrated that the promoter of restin gene could be induced by ATRA. Then, another two luciferase reporter plasmids driven by the reporter of restin with no (RPdelta p53-luc) or mutant (mRP-luc) p53 binding site were constructed to see the regulation of restin by p53. Results showed that the transcriptional upregulation of restin gene was not due to the putative p53 binding site on the upstream of restin gene.

Necdin, a p53-interacting protein expressed predominantly in postmitotic neurons, is a melanoma antigen family protein that promotes neuronal differentiation and survival. In mammals, the necdin gene (Ndn) is maternally imprinted, and mutant mice carrying mutated paternal Ndn show abnormalities of neuronal development. Here we report that necdin regulates the acetylation status of p53 via Sirt1 to suppress p53-dependent apoptosis in postmitotic neurons. Double-immunostaining analysis demonstrated that necdin colocalizes with Sirt1 in postmitotic neurons of mouse embryonic forebrain in vivo. Coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro binding analyses revealed that necdin interacts with both p53 and Sirt1 to potentiate Sirt1-mediated p53 deacetylation by facilitating their association. Primary cortical neurons prepared from paternal Ndn-deficient mice have high p53 acetylation levels and are sensitive to the DNA-damaging compounds camptothecin and hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, DNA transfection per se increases p53 acetylation and apoptosis in paternal Ndn-deficient neurons, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated p53 knockdown completely blocks these changes. However, Sirt1 knockdown increases both acetylated p53 level and apoptosis in wild-type neurons but fails to affect them in paternal Ndn-deficient neurons. In organotypic forebrain slice cultures treated with hydrogen peroxide, p53 is accumulated and colocalized with necdin and Sirt1 in cortical neurons. These results suggest that necdin downregulates p53 acetylation levels by forming a stable complex with p53 and Sirt1 to protect neurons from DNA damage-induced apoptosis.",

Tyrosinase expression increases during tumorigenesis, which could allow for selective treatment of this tumor type by strategies that use tyrosinase activity. Approaches targeting tyrosinase would involve gene transcription or signal transduction pathways mediated by p53 in a direct or indirect manner. Two pathways are proposed for exploiting tyrosinase expression: (a) a p53-dependent pathway leading to apoptosis or arrest and (b) a reactive oxygen species-mediated induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress in p53 mutant tumors. Both strategies could use tyrosinase-mediated activation of quercetin, a dietary polyphenol that induces the expression of p53 and modulates reactive oxygen species. In addition to antitumor signaling properties, activation of quercetin could complement conventional cancer therapy by the induction of phase II detoxification enzymes resulting in p53 stabilization and transduction of its downstream targets. In conclusion, recent advances in tyrosinase enzymology, prodrug chemistry, and modern chemotherapeutics present an intriguing and selective multitherapy targeting system where dietary bioflavonoids could be used to complement conventional cancer treatments.",

To date, few genetic alterations have been observed in skin neoplasia. In this study we have used a recently developed monoclonal antibody (DO7) to examine p53 protein expression in a wide variety of benign and malignant skin lesions. Benign skin lesions were negative, but a significant number of malignant epithelial lesions showed detectable p53; 56% of squamous carcinomas and 42% of basal cell carcinomas were positive. A smaller proportion of dysplastic epithelial lesions were positive (27%), and only 3.6% of malignant melanomas were positive. Thus, although detectable p53 protein is a common occurrence in malignant epithelial lesions, it does not correlate with the malignant phenotype or with metastatic potential. The finding of a lower proportion of positivity in dysplastic lesions, and absence of staining in benign tumours, suggests that p53 mutation may be involved in the progression towards invasive malignancy in human squamous skin lesions.",

Additional analysis of PTCH mutations in the subset of eight basal call carcinomas (BCC) revealed a very high mutation frequency of this gene (90%) which exceeded that detected in the p53 gene in the same tumors (38%). PTCH mutations were predominantly UV-specific C>T transitions. This mutation pattern is different from that reported in BCC from normal donors where PTCH mutation frequency is 27% and mutations are frequently deletions and insertions.

Mutations in the core promoter region of the TERT gene, which increases promoter activity, have been reported in melanomas and a variety of human neoplasms, including gliomas. In the present study, we screened for TERT promoter mutations by direct DNA sequencing in a population-based collection of 358 glioblastomas. TERT promoter mutations (C228T, C250T) were detected in 55 % glioblastomas analysed. Of these, 73 % had a C228T mutation, and 27 % had a C250T mutation; only one glioblastoma had both C228T and C250T mutations. TERT promoter mutations were significantly more frequent in primary (IDH1 wild-type) glioblastomas (187/322; 58 %) than in secondary (IDH1 mutated) glioblastomas (10/36, 28 %; P = 0.0056). They showed significant inverse correlations with IDH1 mutations (P = 0.0056) and TP53 mutations (P = 0.043), and a significant positive correlation with EGFR amplification (P = 0.048). Glioblastoma patients with TERT mutations showed a shorter survival than those without TERT mutations in univariate analysis (median, 9.3 vs. 10.5 months; P = 0.015) and multivariate analysis after adjusting for age and gender (HR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.01-1.88, P = 0.041). However, TERT mutations had no significant impact on patients' survival in multivariate analysis after further adjusting for other genetic alterations, or when primary and secondary glioblastomas were separately analysed. These results suggest that the prognostic value of TERT mutations for poor survival is largely due to their inverse correlation with IDH1 mutations, which are a significant prognostic marker of better survival in patients with secondary glioblastomas.",

We initially tested whether loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the p53 and the patched (ptch) genes was related to EMAST in a series of 61 non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) tumors. We then analysed a series of 57 primary bladder cancers for the presence of EMAST, testing whether this was related to mutation or expression of the p53 gene. In both NMSC and bladder tumors we found a high prevalence of EMAST (75.4 and 43.9%). In NMSC the prevalence of EMAST was higher in tumors that had either p53 or ptch LOH, although the difference was not statistically significant. There was a significant association of extensive EMAST (three or more loci) with mutations in p53 among the bladder cancer tumors, but no indication of elevated EMAST in tumors with abnormal p53 staining without mutation. The association of EMAST with p53 mutation was confined to non-invasive disease. Hence, EMAST likely reflects a particular pattern of somatic events that are interactive with p53 mutation, particularly common in skin cancer and limited to non-invasive disease in bladder cancer.",

UV radiation has been mainly implicated as the cause of non-melanoma skin cancer, although some role for UV in malignant melanoma has been suggested. The induction of skin cancer is mainly caused by the accumulation of mutations caused by UV damage. Cellular mechanisms exist to repair the DNA damage, or to induce apoptosis to remove severely damaged cells; however, the additive effects of mutations in genes involved in these mechanisms, or in control of the cell cycle, can lead to abnormal cell proliferation and tumor development. The molecular events in the induction of skin cancer are being actively investigated, and recent research has added to the understanding of the roles of tumor suppressor and oncogenes in skin cancer. UV radiation has been shown to induce the expression of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, and is known to produce \"signature\" mutations in p53 in human and mouse skin cancers and in the tumor suppressor gene patched in human basal cell carcinoma. The role of UV radiation in suppression of immune surveillance in the skin, which is an important protection against skin tumor development, is also being investigated.

        "Doc_abstract":"Previously we have demonstrated an apoptosis inducing activity for a rat hepatocyte conditioned medium (CM) presumably mediated by acidic isoferritins. Here, we present support for this assumption since isoferritins purified from different rat hepatocyte CM significantly enhanced the frequency of apoptotic cells in primary rat hepatocytes, an effect completely inhibited by a neutralizing anti-H-ferritin antibody. The apoptosis induction appears to be related to a 43 kDa ferritin subunit contained in the isoferritins released from primary hepatocytes, presumably representing a ferritin heavy/light chain heterodimer. In addition, these isoferritins immunologically crossreact with antibodies raised against placental isoferritin p43-PLF (which also contains a 43 kDa ferritin subunit) and melanoma-derived H-chain ferritin, representing ferritin isoforms which reveal immunomodulatory properties. Furthermore, p53 and FasL are upregulated upon isoferritin treatment in a time dependent mode, and apoptosis induction can be suppressed by neutralizing anti-FasL antibodies. Proapoptotic Bid is upregulated too and translocated into mitochondria in primary hepatocytes exposed to the isoferritins purified from the CM. Finally, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and dexamethasone (DEX), which counteract proapoptotic mitochondrial signalling, almost completely abolished the proapoptotic effect of the hepatocyte derived isoferritins. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that acidic isoferritins with homology to immunomodulatory ferritin isoforms (p43-PLF, melanoma-derived-H-chain ferritin) are released from hepatocytes in vitro, and are able to stimulate upregulation of p53 and mediate apoptosis involving Fas (CD95) signalling as well as addressing the intrinsic mitochondrial proapoptotic pathway.",

Clinical and experimental evidence also reveals that p53 mutations sometimes occur in tumor-associated fibroblasts, which correlate with an increased rate of metastases and poor prognosis, suggesting that p53 dysfunction in the tumor microenvironment (TME) favors tumor establishment and progression. To understand the impact of p53 inactivation in the TME in tumor progression, we compared the growth of subcutaneously inoculated B16F1 melanoma in p53(null) and wild-type (WT) mice. Interestingly, tumor growth in p53(null) mice was greatly accelerated, correlating with marked increases in CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells, and a loss of effector function, compared with those in WT mice. This augmented immunotolerant TME in p53(null) mice was associated with a marked expansion of a specialized stromal network in the tumor and spleen. These stromal cells expressed markers of fibroblastic reticular cells of lymphoid organs and were readily expanded in culture from p53(null), but not WT, mice. They produced high levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and immunosuppressive molecules, thereby enhancing MDSC differentiation. Furthermore, they significantly accelerated tumor progression in WT mice when co-injected with B16F1. Together, our results show that tumor-stroma interaction in hosts with dysfunctional p53 exacerbates immunosuppression by expanding the lymphoid-like stromal network that enhances MDSC differentiation and tumor progression.",

Mutations that inactivate the p53 gene and constitutive NF-κB pathway activation are common occurrences in human cancers. Although many drugs are being developed that selectively activate p53 or inhibit NF-κB, there are few drug candidates that can do both. Simultaneous activation of p53 and inhibition of the NF-κB pathway is therefore a prime target for new cancer drug development. This study is the first report of a high-throughput approach with mass compounds that concurrently target both pathways. Using a cell-based screening assay and a library of 200,000 synthetic compounds, we identified 9 small molecules that simultaneously inhibit NF-κB and activate p53. One of these compounds, N-2, increased the expression of p53 target genes, including p21 and GADD45a. In addition, N-2 inhibited the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, concomitantly repressing interleukin-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) expression. When cell lines derived from a diverse range of cancers were treated in vitro with N-2, we observed increased cell death. N-2 also significantly inhibited allograft growth in murine models of melanoma and lung carcinoma. Our findings suggest that N-2 may act as a bivalent anti-cancer agent through simultaneous modulation of NF-κB and p53 activities.",

Here, we describe the presence of thiolated p53 and the dynamic nature of this modification in human tissues using unique and specific polyclonal antibodies raised against a 12-residue p53 peptide bearing a mixed disulfide at Cys-141. The affinity- purified antibodies (glut-p53) were sequence-specific in that they recognized the antigenic peptide but not the unthiolated peptide or a scrambled glutathionylated peptide in ELISAs. On immunoblots, the purified antibodies did not react with native p53 or recombinant p53 (rp53), but readily detected the glutathionylated or cysteinylated or ethanethiol-treated rp53 only under nonreducing conditions. Untreated HCT116 cells showed low levels of glut-p53, which increased markedly after H(2)O(2), diamide, cisplatin, and doxorubicin treatments. Glut-p53 levels decreased sharply after cells were passed into oxidant-free medium, suggesting efficient dethiolation. The mutant p53 present in HT29 and T47D human cancer cells was also recognized. In vitro, the glut-p53 was rapidly degraded by rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Human prostate and prostate cancer tissues showed an abundant presence of glut-p53 in luminal epithelium, a site well known to generate ROS. Melanoma and colon cancer samples were also positive for glut-p53. The availability of the thiolation-specific antibodies should enhance our knowledge of p53 regulation in redox-perturbed states found in various diseases including cancer.",

We also investigate the contribution of NO to the formation of skin melanoma in mice.;Similar to the TOP2-targeting drug, etoposide (VP-16), the NO-donor, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), induces skin melanomas formation in 7,12-dimethyl- benz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated mice. To explore the mechanism(s) underlying this NO-induced tumorigenesis, we use a co-culture model system to demonstrate that inflamed macrophages with inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression cause γ-H2AX activation, p53 phosphorylation, and chromosome DNA breaks in the target cells. Inhibitor experiments revealed that NO and TOP2 isozymes are responsible for the above described cellular phenotypes. Notably, NO, unlike VP-16, preferentially induces the formation of TOP2β cleavable complexes (TOP2βcc) in cells. Moreover, GSNO induced TOP2-dependent DNA sequence rearrangements and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the incidences of GSNO- and VP-16-induced skin melanomas were also observed to be lower in the skin-specific top2β-knockout mice. Our results suggest that TOP2 isozymes contribute to NO-induced mutagenesis and subsequent cancer development during chronic inflammation.;We provide the first experimental evidence for the functional role of TOP2 in NO-caused DNA damage, mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis.

MVE was prepared by the modified pharmacopoeial percolation method and characterized by UHPLC-LTQ OrbiTrap MS. MVE dose-dependently reduced viability of melanoma (B16) and glioma (U251) cells, but not peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It arrested cell cycle in S+G2/M phase, which was associated with the activation of MAP kinase p38 and up-regulation of antiproliferative genes p53, p21 and p27. MVE induced oxidative stress, while antioxidants abrogated its antitumor effect. Furthermore, MVE induced mitochondrial depolarization, activation of caspase-9 and -3, Parp cleavage, phosphatidylserine exposure and DNA fragmentation. The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was associated with the up-regulation of proapoptotic genes Pten, Bak1, Apaf1, and Puma and down-regulation of antiapoptotic genes survivin and Xiap. MVE also stimulated the expression of autophagy-related genes Atg5, Atg7, Atg12, Beclin-1, Gabarab and Sqstm1, as well as LC3-I conversion to the autophagosome associated LC3-II, while autophagy inhibitors exacerbated its cytotoxicity. Finally, the most abundant phenolic components of MVE, ferulic, p-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids, did not exert a profound effect on viability of tumor cells, suggesting that other components individually or in concert are the mediators of the extracts' cytotoxicity. By demonstrating the ability of MVE to inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis and cytoprotective autophagy, our results suggest that MVE, alone or combined with autophagy inhibitors, could be a good candidate for anti-melanoma and anti-glioma therapy.",

Immunostaining for p53 has disclosed a characteristic compact pattern not only in cancer/precancer but also in areas of microscopically normal epidermis termed p53 patches. By microdissection, sequence analysis of the p53 gene, and analysis of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the site of this gene, we have now extended previous data to ascertain whether these p53 patches are precursors of simultaneously present squamous cell cancer or its morphologically recognized precancerous stages (dysplasia, carcinoma in situ). In none of 11 instances with co-existence of a p53 patch with dysplasia or in situ or invasive cancer were the mutations identical. We conclude that p53 patches, estimated to be approximately 100,000 times as common as dysplasia, have a very small or even no precancerous potential. Their common presence demonstrates that human epidermis contains a large number of p53 mutations apparently without detrimental effect. The only result of the mutation may be a clandestine benign clonal keratinocyte proliferation. The importance of p53 mutations for such benign cell multiplication on one band and malignant transformation on the other is unclear. Although the spectrum, type, and multiplicity of mutations were similar in both types of proliferative responses, there was a clear difference with respect to LOH. No LOH was found in 17 p53 patches.

Therefore the question arises, which protective mechanisms could be involved in the skin of these patients preventing the initiation of these cancers. Recently an overexpression of p53 has been shown in vitiligo. Unfortunately there was no further characterization of this elevated p53. Employing a functional colour yeast assay, the study presented herein demonstrates for the first time the overexpression of a functioning wild-type p53 protein in both depigmented and 'normal' pigmented epidermis of patients with vitiligo compared with healthy controls. Surprisingly long-term narrowband UVB (311 nm) treatment does not alter this expression. Moreover, MDM-2, PCNA and p21 protein expression remain unchanged compared with healthy controls. This increased epidermal p53 in vitiligo coincides with decreased thioredoxin reductase (TR) protein levels in both depigmented and pigmented skin whereas mRNA expression is unaffected. Because TR is one transcriptional target of p53, these results support a wild-type functionality, which was further supported by the specific p53 FASAY yeast test. To our knowledge this is the first example of persistent elevated functioning wild-type p53 in humans. Based on our results we hypothesize that the low incidence for actinic damage, basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma as documented in vitiligo could well reside in a protective function of up-regulated wild-type p53.",

However, there have been few reviews focusing on a single miRNA family. The dysregulation of miRNAs appears to play a crucial role in cancer pathogenesis where they exert their effect as oncogenes or as tumour suppressors. This review summarises current studies on the dysregulation of the microRNA-34 (miR-34) family in different types of cancers and its role in the p53 network. The structure of the miR-34 family members includes p53-binding sites reflecting their function as tumour suppressors downstream of the p53 pathway. miR-34 dysregulation occurs in cancers, including several epithelial cancers, melanomas, neuroblastomas, leukemias and sarcomas, in the presence or absence of the p53 mutation. For these cancers, functional restoration of miR-34 is a useful novel therapy. As evidenced from preclinical and clinical studies, the miR-34 family plays an important role in the treatment of miR-34-dysregulated cancers with mutant or wild-type p53.

Induction of CAGE resulted from decreased expression and thereby displacement of DNA methyltransferase 1(DNMT1) from CAGE promoter sequences. Various drugs induce expression of CAGE by decreasing expression of DNMT1, and hypomethylation of CAGE was correlated with the increased expression of CAGE. Down-regulation of CAGE in these cell lines decreased invasion and enhanced drug sensitivity resulting from increased apoptosis. Down-regulation of CAGE also led to decreased anchorage-independent growth. Down-regulation of CAGE led to increased expression of p53, suggesting that CAGE may act as a negative regulator of p53. Down-regulation of p53 enhanced resistance to drugs and prevented drugs from exerting apoptotic effects. In SNU387(R) cells, CAGE induced the interaction between histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and Snail, which exerted a negative effect on p53 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that CAGE, through interaction with HDAC2, exerted a negative effect on p53 expression in Malme3M(R) cells. These results suggest that CAGE confers drug resistance by regulating expression of p53 through HDAC2. Taken together, these results show the potential value of CAGE as a target for the development of cancer therapeutics.",

We have analyzed skin lesions from RTRs with aggressive tumors for p53 gene modifications, the presence of Human Papillomas Virus (HPV) DNA in relation to the p53 codon 72 genotype and polymorphisms of the XPD repair gene. We detected 24 p53 mutations in 15/25 (60%) NMSCs, 1 deletion and 23 base substitutions, the majority (78%) being UV-specific C to T transitions at bipyrimidine sites. Importantly, 35% (6/17) are tandem mutations, including 4 UV signature CC to TT transitions possibly linked to modulated DNA repair caused by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). We found 8 p53 mutations in 7/17 (41%) precancerous actinic keratosis (AK), suggesting that p53 mutations are early events in RTR skin carcinogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis shows a good correlation between p53 accumulation and mutations. HPV DNA was detected in 78% of skin lesions (60% Basal Cell Carcinomas, 82%AK and 79% SCCs). Thus, immunosuppression has increased the risk of infections by HPVs, predominantly epidermodysplasia verruciformis, speculated to play a role in skin cancer development. No association is found between HPV status and p53 mutation. Moreover, p53 codon 72 or frequencies of three XPD genotypes of RTRs are comparable with control populations. The p53 mutation spectrum, presenting a high level of CC to TT mutations, shows that the UV component of sunlight is the major risk factor and modulated DNA repair by immunosuppressive drug treatment may be significant in the skin carcinogenesis of RTRs.",

However, the underlying mechanisms for interaction between p53 and IGF-1R are still not fully understood. One of the challenging questions remaining to be answered is why the wild-type p53, which per se represses the transcription of the IGF-1R gene, in overexpressed form is necessary for a high IGF-1R expression. In this study, we show that inhibition of p53 causes ubiquitination and down-regulation, through increased degradation, of the IGF-1R in human malignant melanoma cells. This effect, which was independent of the p53 status (i.e., wild type or mutated), was prevented if Mdm2 was coinhibited. Similar results were obtained in UV-irradiated human melanocytes (harboring wild-type p53), in which level of the IGF-1R increased after up-regulation of p53. Interestingly, the basal ubiquitination of the IGF-1R in untreated cells also depended on Mdm2. We could prove that Mdm2 physically associates with IGF-1R and that Mdm2 causes IGF-1R ubiquitination in an in vitro assay. Taken together our data provide evidence that Mdm2 serves as a ligase in ubiquitination of the IGF-1R and thereby causes its degradation by the proteasome system. Consequently, by sequestering Mdm2 in the cell nuclei, the level of p53 may indirectly influence the expression of IGF-1R. This role of Mdm2 and p53 represents an unexpected mechanism for the regulation of IGF-1R and cell growth.",

A designed PA analogue; DENSpm, induces cell cycle arrest, inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in melanoma, breast, prostate, lung and colon cancer cells. Although the mechanism by which DENSpm induces apoptosis has been examined, the effect of DENSpm on autophagy has not been investigated yet. Therefore, in this study, our objective was to determine the role of p53 in the DENSpm-induced autophagy/apoptotic regulation in a time-dependent manner in colon cancer cells. Exposure of HCT 116 colon cancer cells to DENSpm decreased cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, the p53 mutant, SW480, and deficient HCT 116 p53(-/-) cells were more resistant to DENSpm treatment compared to HCT 116 p53(+/+) cells. The resistant profile caused by p53 defect also caused a cell type-specific response to PA pool depletion and SSAT overexpression. In addition to PA depletion, DENSpm induced apoptosis by activating the mitochondria-mediated pathway in a caspase-dependent manner regardless of p53 expression in colon cancer cells. Concomitantly, we determined that DENSpm also affected autophagy in HCT 116 p53(+/+), SW480 and HCT 116 p53(-/-) colon cancer cells for different periods of exposure to DENSpm. Therefore, this study revealed that effect of DENSpm on cell death differs due to p53 protein expression profile. In addition, DENSpm-induced autophagy may be critical in drug resistance in colon cancer cells. ",

Here, we report that tumours from Δ122p53 homozygous mice show evidence of invasion and metastasis and that Δ122p53 promotes migration though a 3-dimensional collagen matrix. We also show that Δ122p53 and Δ133p53 promote cell migration in scratch wound and Transwell assays, similar to the 'gain-of-function' phenotypes seen with mutant p53. Using the well-defined B16 mouse melanoma metastatic model, we show that Δ122p53 leads to faster generation of lung metastases.

Melanin is a natural skin protective factor against UV radiation. Skin cancers associated with long-term exposure to UV radiation are: basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). The high risk of BCC development is related to acute and repeated exposure to UV causing sunburn. Molecular studies of BBC demonstrated disorders in sonic hedgehog (SHH) cell signaling regulation pathway, associated with the suppressor protein patched homolog 1 gene (PTCH1) mutations. The risk of the BCC development is related to the polymorphism of melanokortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R). Tumor P53 gene mutations observed in BCC cells has been classified as secondary genetic changes. In SCC cells UV-induced mutations were mostly related to P53 gene. Increased expression of cyclooxigenase- 2 gene (COX-2) plays a significant role in the development of SCC. Other pathogenetic factors include intensification of the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 α (IL-1α), IL-1β and IL-6). Currently, the role of UVB has been recognized in the pathogenesis of CMM. In CMM cells the following gene mutations were noted: cyclindependent kinase inhibitor 2A INK4A (p16INK4A), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), Ras, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and proto-oncogene B-Raf (BRAF). The BRAF gene mutations were observed in ~50% of CMM cases. Mutations of P53 gene are not characteristic of CMM cells.

Do powierzchni Ziemi dociera ok. 95% promieniowania ultrafioletowego A (UVA) (320–400 nm) i ok. 5% UVB (280–320 nm). Naturalnym czynnikiem ochronnym skóry przed UV jest melanina. Do raków skóry, których rozwój jest związany z długotrwałym narażeniem na promieniowanie UV, zalicza się niebarwnikowe raki skóry (non-melanoma skin cancers – NMSC) – raka podstawnokomórkowego (basal cell carcinoma – BCC) i raka kolczystokomórkowego (squamous cell carcinoma – SCC) oraz czerniaka złośliwego skóry (cutaneous malignant melanoma – CMM). Wysokie ryzyko rozwoju BCC związane jest z ostrą i wielokrotną ekspozycją na UV, powodującą oparzenia słoneczne. Badania molekularne BCC wykazały zaburzenia na szlaku regulacji sygnalizacji komórkowej sonic hedgehog (SHH), które były związane z mutacjami genu supresorowego PTCH1 (protein patched homolog 1). Ryzyko rozwoju BCC jest również związane z polimorfizmem genu receptora melanokortyny-1 (MC1R). Obserwowane w komórkach BCC mutacje genu P53 klasyfikowano jako wtórne zmiany genetyczne. W komórkach SCC mutacje indukowane UV najczęściej dotyczyły genu P53. W rozwoju SCC istotne znaczenie ma zwiększona ekspresja genu enzymu cyklooksygenazy-2 (COX-2). Innym czynnikiem patogenetycznym SCC jest nasilenie syntezy cytokin prozapalnych (czynnika martwicy nowotworu α (tumor necrosis factor α – TNF-α), interleukiny-1 α (IL-1α), IL-1β i IL-6).

Patient was diagnosed with stage III (T3, N1a, MO) medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), multicentric micropapillary thyroid carcinoma, scapular and lumbar melanomas (Clark II, Breslow II), and lobular invasive breast carcinoma (T1a, NO, MO). All tumors present in our patient except micropapillary thyroid carcinomas were investigated for gene alterations known to have a key role in cancer promotion and progression. Tumor samples were screened for the p16 alterations (loss of heterozygosity and homozygous deletions), loss of heterozygosity of PTEN, p53 alterations (mutational status and loss of heterozygosity) and mutational status of RET, HRAS and KRAS. Each type of tumor investigated had specific pattern of analyzed genetic alterations. The most prominent genetic changes were mutual alterations in PTEN and p53 tumor suppressors present in breast cancer and two melanomas. These co-alterations could be crucial for promoting development of multiple malignancies. Moreover the insertion in 4(th) codon of HRAS gene was common for all tumor types investigated. It represents frameshift mutation introducing stop codon at position 5 which prevents synthesis of a full-length protein. Since the inactivated RAS enhances sensitivity to tamoxifen and radiotherapy this genetic alteration could be considered as a good prognostic factor for this patient. ",

Inhibition of MAPK kinase (MEK), an upstream kinase, by U0126, blocked TPA-induced activation of ERK1/2 in wild-type p53 cells and in mutant p53 cells. Treatment of wild-type p53 (SK-Mel 186) cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) of p53 displayed a transient induction of activation of ERK1/2 following TPA treatment, indicating that p53 has a role in the regulation of the activation of ERK1/2. NF-kappaB activity decreased significantly in cells with wild-type p53, while enhanced NF-kappaB activity was evident in cells with mutant p53. The expression of either wild-type or mutant p53 had a similar effect on TPA-induced Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, indicating specificity for the ERK pathway. Similarly, AP-1 binding activity showed a transient variation in both cell lines after TPA treatment but with different kinetics. These observations suggest that both wild-type and mutant p53 can modulate the activation pathways for ERK1/2, and NF-kappaB distinctively, while modulating the pathways of JNK and AP-1 similarly. These differences may influence cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of B-Raf mutations in sporadic BCCs as well as its correlation with the phenotype of microsatellite instability (MSI), the clinicopathological parameters of the tumours and p53 protein expression. 83 BCC specimens were screened for B-Raf mutations, applying polymerase chain reaction, single-stranded conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and DNA sequencing. MSI status was examined using mononucleotide microsatellite markers and p53 protein expression was demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining. A C to T transition at 1790 nucleotide leading to a silent mutation L597L; and a T to A transversion causing an amino acid change (F610I) have been found. MSI was detected in 5% of the cases and p53 accumulation was present in 37/83 samples studied. Although rare B-Raf alterations have been observed in BCC, none of them harboured the hot-spot mutation T1799A commonly present in melanomas and colon carcinomas. Consequently, no correlation could be determined between B-Raf alterations, MSI status, the clinicopathological features and p53 protein expression. Our results are in favour of a secondary importance for Ras signalling cascade genes in BCC pathogenesis.",

RNF5 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been implicated in motility and endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Here, we show that RNF5 expression is up-regulated in breast cancer tumors and related cell lines. Elevated expression of RNF5 was seen in breast cancer cell lines that became more sensitive to cytochalasin D- and paclitaxel-induced apoptosis following its knockdown with specific short interfering RNA. Inhibition of RNF5 expression markedly decreased cell proliferation and caused a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to stress in MCF-7 but not in p53 mutant breast cancer cells, suggesting a p53-dependent function. Significantly, high levels of RNF5 were associated with decreased survival in human breast cancer specimens. Similarly, RNF5 levels were higher in metastatic melanoma specimens and in melanoma, leukemia, ovarian, and renal tumor-derived cell lines, suggesting that increased RNF5 expression may be a common event during tumor progression. These results indicate that RNF5 is a novel regulator of breast cancer progression through its effect on actin cytoskeletal alterations, which also affect sensitivity of breast cancer cells to cytoskeletal targeting antineoplastic agents.",

These vectors were compared for E2Ftr expression and apoptosis induction in cancer cells and normal cells. E2Ftr antitumor activity in vivo also was assessed in a melanoma xenograft model.;One of the 3 vectors, AdTet-E2Ftr3, had the highest E2Ftr protein expression levels, which were correlated with the greatest induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cancer cell growth. E2Ftr induced apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines independent of p53 status with little cytotoxicity in normal cell lines.

Panaxydol is known to be one of the cytotoxic polyacetylenic compounds of P. ginseng. In this study, we first showed that panaxydol decreased markedly the proliferation, and to a lesser extent, the number of cells in a human melanoma cell line, SK-MEL-1. Next, the effect of panaxydol on cell cycle progression and its mechanism of action were investigated. Cell cycle analysis revealed that panaxydol inhibited cell cycle progression of a human malignant melanoma cell line, SK-MEL-1, at G(1)-S transition. At the same time, panaxydol increased the protein expression of p27(KIP1) as early as 1 hr after treatment. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) activity was decreased in a dose-dependent manner after 24 hr of panaxydol treatment. Protein levels of p21(WAF1), p16(INK4a), p53, pRb (retinoblastoma protein), and E2F-1 were not changed. It was also found that cycloheximide reversed the growth inhibition induced by panaxydol and partially abrogated the increase in p27(KIP1) expression.

Earlier, we have reported the discovery of internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) within the p53 mRNA that regulate the translation of the full length and its N-terminal-truncated isoform, ΔN-p53. Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) is an IRES trans-acting factor that positively regulates the IRES activities of both p53 isoforms by relocating from nucleus to the cytoplasm during stress conditions. Here we have demonstrated the putative contact points of PTB on the p53 IRES RNA. Studies on mutations that occur naturally in the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) in p53 mRNA were lacking. We have investigated a naturally occurring C-to-T single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) first reported in human melanoma tumors. This SNP is at position 119 in the 5' UTR of p53 mRNA and we demonstrate that it has consequences on the translational control of p53. Introduction of this SNP has led to decrease in cap-independent translation from p53 5' UTR in bicistronic reporter assay. Further, the effects of this SNP on cap-independent translation have been studied in the context of p53 cDNA as well. Interestingly, the 5' UTR with this SNP has shown reduced binding to PTB that can be corroborated to its weaker IRES activity. Previously, it has been shown that G2-M checkpoint, DNA-damaging stress and oncogenic insult favor IRES-mediated translation. Under similar conditions, we demonstrate that this SNP interferes with the enhancement of the IRES activity of the 5' UTR. Taken together, the results demonstrate for the first time that SNP in the 5' UTR of the p53 mRNA might have a role in translational control of this critical tumor-suppressor gene.",

In this study we have compared the influence of abrogation of PARP-1 expression by stable gene silencing to that of the pharmacological inhibition of cellular PARP activity using PARP-1/-2 inhibitors on the chemosensitivity of tumour cells to the wide spectrum methylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) and to the N3-adenine selective methylating agent {1-methyl-4-[1-methyl-4-(3-methoxysulfonylpropanamido)pyrrole-2-carboxamido]-pyrrole-2-carboxamido}propane (Me-Lex). Silencing of PARP-1 in melanoma or cervical carcinoma lines enhanced in vitro sensitivity to TMZ and Me- Lex, and induced a higher level of cell accumulation at the G2/M phase of cell cycle with respect to controls. GPI 15427, which inhibits both PARP-1 and PARP-2, increased sensitivity to TMZ and Me-Lex both in PARP-1-proficient and - deficient cells. However, it induced different cell cycle modulations depending on PARP-1 expression, provoking a G2/M arrest only in PARP-1 silenced cells. Treatment of PARP-1 silenced cells with TMZ or Me-Lex resulted in a more extensive phosphorylation of Chk-1 and p53 as compared to PARP-1 proficient cells. The combination of the methylating agents with GPI 15427 increased Chk-1 and p53 phosphorylation both in PARP-1 proficient or deficient cells. When mice challenged with PARP-1 silenced melanoma cells were treated with the TMZ and PARP inhibitor combination there was an additional reduction in tumour growth with respect to treatment with TMZ alone. These results suggest the involvement of PARP-2 or other PARPs, in the repair of DNA damage provoked by methylating agents, highlighting the importance of targeting both PARP-1 and PARP-2 for cancer therapy.",

However, preincubation with silibinin prior to mitomycin C treatment substantially suppressed cell apoptosis, attenuated the change of p53 and Bcl-2 expressions, blocked the translocation of Bax to mitochondrial outer membrane, and ameliorated the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, but mitomycin C stimuli led to few changes in the protein levels of caspase 8, Fas ligand, and Fas-associated death domain protein, indicating that silibinin protected cells from mitomycin C-induced apoptosis mainly via suppressing the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway, but not in an extrinsic manner.",

It was originally reported that induction of KILLER/DR5 mRNA following DNA damage was p53-dependent, but some drugs that induce apoptosis can upregulate KILLER/DR5 mRNA expression in cell lines with mutated p53. We further extend those findings by classifying the capability of various apoptosis-inducing drugs to increase the expression of KILLER/DR5 mRNA in a p53-independent manner. beta-Lapachone, a topoisomerase inhibitor, increased KILLER/DR5 mRNA in colon cancer cell lines with wild-type p53 but not with mutant p53. In contrast, betulinic acid, a novel chemotherapeutic compound, induced apoptosis and KILLER/DR5 mRNA in melanoma and glioblastoma cells through a p53-independent mechanism. The synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone elevated KILLER/DR5 mRNA in glioblastoma, ovarian cancer, and colon cancer cell lines with mutant p53 undergoing apoptosis, and this induction was inhibited by the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. Although another glucocorticoid, prednisolone, also induced apoptosis, it did not increase KILLER/DR5 mRNA. Finally, the cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induced apoptosis and KILLER/DR5 in cell lines with mutant p53, and the induction of KILLER/DR5 mRNA by IFN-gamma was delayed in cells lacking wild-type STAT1, a transcription factor implicated in IFN-gamma signaling. Similarly, the induction of KILLER/DR5 mRNA by the cytokine TNF-alpha was also delayed in cell lines with mutated STAT1.

Nongenotoxic activation of p53 by targeting specific molecular pathways therefore provides an attractive therapeutic strategy in cancers with wild-type p53. Here, we explored the antitumor potential of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors in combination with a small molecule inhibitor of p53-murine double minute 2 (MDM2) interaction. We show that low doses of CDK inhibitors roscovitine and DRB synergize with the MDM2 antagonist nutlin-3a in the induction of p53 activity and promote p53-dependent apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Statistical measurement of the combination effects shows that the drug combination is additive on the reduction of cell viability and synergistic on inducing apoptosis, a critical end point of cytotoxic drugs. The degree of apoptosis observed 24 to 48 h after drug treatment correlated with the accumulation of p53 protein and concomitant induction of proapoptotic proteins Puma and PIG3. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of this drug combination are validated in a range of tumor-derived cells including melanoma, colon carcinoma, breast adenocarcinoma, and hepatocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, this drug combination does not induce phosphorylation of Ser(15) on p53 and does not induce genotoxic stress in the cell. Given that many cytotoxic drugs rely on their ability to induce apoptosis via DNA damage-mediated activation of p53, the data presented here may provide a new therapeutic approach for the use of CDK inhibitors and MDM2 antagonists in combinatorial drug therapy.",

Laboratory data suggest certain dietary constituents, notably omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), could potentially protect against skin malignancy, although no large-scale review has been conducted in humans. The objective of this review and meta-analysis was to determine the relationship between dietary n-3 PUFAs and skin cancer incidence. It considered all published randomized controlled trials and observational studies up to March 2013. Five studies (two case-control and three cohort) were identified pertaining to oral n-3 PUFA consumption and incidence of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), melanoma (or a combination) and were included in a random-effects meta-analysis. A further six studies considering nondietary n-3 PUFA exposure (e.g., by tissue analysis) and/or recognized biological markers of skin cancer risk (e.g., p53 expression) were analyzed qualitatively. Dietary n-3 PUFAs were not associated with BCC (pooled OR 1.05, 95% CIs 0.86-1.28). Consumption of high levels of n-3 PUFAs were inversely associated with melanoma, although with only one estimate available (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34-0.78), and SCC, although nonsignificantly (pooled OR 0.86, 95% CIs 0.59-1.23).

This treatment also suppresses activation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and MKK3/6; however, it upregulates MKK4 activity. JNK, as determined by its phosphorylation state, is subsequently activated, triggering apoptosis. Incubation of cells with antibody reduced levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, while elevating pro-apoptotic BAD, BAX and BAK expression as well as cleaved caspases-3, -7, -8 and -9. Silencing GRP78 or p53 gene expression by RNAi prior to antibody treatment abrogated these effects.

Additional yeast two-hybrid assays indicated that filamin A specifically interacts with the p73alpha C-terminus, which is lacking in p53 and p73beta. The interaction was confirmed by GST pull-down assays in vitro and by immunoprecipitation analysis in vivo. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that p73alpha remained in the cytoplasm in A7 melanoma cells stably expressing filamin A, whereas it was localized in the nucleus of filamin A-deficient M2 cells. Deletion of the C-terminus of p73alpha (residues 487-636) resulted in nuclear localization in both cell types. Consistent with our interaction data, transient co-expression of filamin A resulted in the down-regulation of p73alpha, but not of p53, transcriptional activity on various p53-responsive promoters. Taken together, our data suggest that p73alpha is sequestered in the cytoplasm by filamin A, thereby inhibiting its transcriptional activity.",

This study evaluates immunohistochemistry using Ki-67, an antibody to a nuclear protein expressed in proliferating cells, and DO-7, an antibody to the product of the tumour suppressor gene p53, as prognostic indicators for these tumours. Immunohistochemistry with Ki-67 has been correlated with the behaviour of many different tumours, but its value as a prognostic indicator in astrocytic tumours is diminished by the conflicting results of previous studies. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies to the p53 protein has been used as a prognostic indicator in melanomas and some carcinomas, but the relation between prognosis and accumulation of this protein in astrocytic tumours has not been clarified. We have tested the hypothesis that survival is correlated with Ki-67 immunolabelling indices (LIs) and patterns of p53 immunolabelling in the cerebral astrocytic tumours of a large cohort of patients (n = 123) for whom clinical indices were well documented. Astrocytic tumours were divided into three histological types: fibrillary astrocytoma (n = 24), anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 31), and glioblastoma (n = 68). Histological type and patient age were independent predictors of survival. Median Ki-67 LIs differed significantly (P < 0.0001) between the types of astrocytic tumour, and tumours with a Ki-67 LI < 2% had a significantly (P < 0.0001) better prognosis. Ki-67 LI as a continuous variable carried a significant (P = 0.0043) unadjusted hazard to survival which was lost when adjusted for other variables, notably histological type. By contrast, no relation was found between survival and three categories of p53 labeling (p53-negative, p53 LI < 40%, and p53 LI > 60%). The results indicate that, whereas Ki-67 immunohistochemistry predicts survival in patients with astrocytic tumours, conventional histological appraisal remains the best guide to prognosis, and immunohistochemistry for p53 has no value in the assessment of these tumours.",

This study aimed to determine the following: (1) the relation between HPV infection and the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and (2) whether there is a correlation between p53 codon 72 polymorphism and the development of SCC.;Blood samples were taken from 55 patients with skin cancer (both renal transplant recipients and immunocompetent patients with skin cancer) and 115 ethnically matched volunteers. A polymerase chain reaction based assay was used to determine p53 codon 72 genotypes. In addition, 49 benign and malignant lesions from 34 of the patients with skin cancer and 20 normal human skin samples from 20 of the control volunteers were examined for HPV.;The proportions of p53 codon 72 genotypes found were 78% arginine homozygous, 2% proline homozygous, and 20% heterozygous among patients with skin cancer and 79% arginine homozygous, 3.5% proline homozygous, and 17.5% heterozygous among the control population.

We characterized 10 novel somatic point mutations in PDGFRA that have been reported in isolated cases of glioblastoma, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, peripheral nerve sheath tumors and neuroendocrine carcinoma. The PDGFRA transmembrane domain mutation V536E stimulated Ba/F3 cell growth and signaling via ERK and STAT5 in the absence of ligand. This mutant, identified in glioblastoma, was strongly inhibited by imatinib. Modeling suggested that the mutation modulates the packing of the transmembrane domain helices in the receptor dimer. By contrast, two mutations in highly conserved residues affected the receptor traffic to the cell surface or kinase activity, thereby preventing the response to PDGF. The other mutations had no significant impact on the receptor activity. This functional analysis matched the predictions of SIFT and PolyPhen for only five mutations and these algorithms do not discriminate gain from loss of function. Finally, an E996K variant that had been identified in a melanoma cell line was not expressed in these cells. Altogether, several newly identified PDGFRA mutations do not activate the receptor and may therefore represent passenger mutations.

We report herein that rIL-24 alone had no effect; however, sequential incubation with rIL-2 and rIL-24 reduced thymidine incorporation by 50% and induced apoptosis of CLL cells in S and G(2)/M phases of the cell cycle, but not of normal adult blood or tonsil B cells. IL-24 stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation in IL-24R1-transfected cells but not in normal or CLL B cells. In contrast, IL-24 reversed the IL-2-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in CLL, and this effect was neutralized by anti-IL-24 Ab. Phospho- (P)STAT3 inhibition induced by IL-24 was reversed by pervanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases. The addition of rIL-24 to IL-2-activated CLL B cells resulted in increases of transcription, protein synthesis. and phosphorylation of p53. The biological effects of IL-24 were reversed by the p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha and partly by the caspase inhibitor zvad. Troglitazone (a protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1B activator) phosphatase inhibited PSTAT3 and augmented p53 expression. PSTAT3 is a transcriptional repressor of p53, and therefore IL-24 induction of p53 secondary to PSTAT3 dephosphorylation may be sensed as a stress signal and promote apoptosis in cycling cells.

Because the cure rate of these neoplasias by conventional treatment is very low, new therapeutic approaches are needed. Entrapping high concentrations of cytotoxic drugs and/or oligonucleotides within stabilized liposomal formulations represents an emerging modality of antitumor treatment. Here, we tested the in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects of a novel antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (asODN) liposomal formulation, the coated cationic liposomes (CCL), by targeting the c-myc and the c-myb oncogenes on melanoma and neuroblastoma, respectively, through the use of a monoclonal antibody against the disialoganglioside GD2, selectively expressed by neuroectoderma-derived tumors. Our methods produced GD2-targeted liposomes that stably entrapped 90 percent of added asODNs. These liposomes showed selective binding for GD2-positive tumor cells in vitro. Neuroblastoma cells treated with free myb-as or nontargeted CCL-myb-as showed the same level of c-myb protein expression as control cells. In contrast, c-myb protein expression of cells treated with aGD2-CCL-myb-as was inhibited by approximately 70 percent. Melanoma and neuroblastoma cell proliferation was inhibited to a greater extent by GD2-targeted liposomes containing c-myc or c-myb asODNs than by nontargeted liposomes or free asODNs. Mice bearing established subcutaneous human melanoma xenografts treated with aGD2-CCL-myc-as exhibited significantly reduced tumor growth and increased survival. The mechanism for the antitumor effects appears to be downregulation of the expression of the c-myc protein, induction of p53, and inhibition of Bcl-2 proteins, leading to extensive tumor cell apoptosis. In contrast, the increased life span obtained in a neuroblastoma pseudometastatic mouse model with the liposomal c-myb asODNs seems to be due to a synergistic mechanism: specific targeting to neuroblastoma cancer cells, downmodulation of c-myb protein expression, and stimulation of the innate immune system. These results suggest that inhibition of c-myc or c-myb proto-oncogenes by GD2-targeted antisense therapy could provide an effective approach for the treatment of neuroectodermal tumors in an adjuvant setting.",

The tumors occur most frequently in fair skinned people, and the mutations typically are found at dipyrimidine sites with C-T or / and CC-TT tandem double mutations. The authors briefly summarize their investigation of the p53 suppressor gene, and expose their hypothesis of hTERT involvement in cancerogenesis. Also their underline the importance of UV induced immunosuppression in photocarcinogenesis. Psoriatic patients are exposed to numerous cancerogens in their treatment. A better understanding of the mechanisms of photocarcinogenesis could provide new ways in the treatment of skin tumors.",

Most tumors develop in chronically sun-exposed skin, most often in cosmetically sensitive locations, where in vivo experiments may be difficult to perform. In this study, we describe a skin organ culture model with preserved normal morphology and intact response to UVR. Skin explants from chronically sun-exposed and non-sun-exposed skin were irradiated with artificial UVA+UVB with and without topical sunscreen. UV-induced DNA damage, epidermal p53 response and repair kinetics were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. Four hours after UV-irradiation epidermal keratinocytes showed a strong immunoreactivity for thymine-dimers. Gradual repair during an incubation time resulted in few residual thymine-dimers after 48 h. Repair appeared to be more efficient in chronically sun-exposed skin compared with non-sun-exposed skin. There was also an accumulation of p53 protein in epidermal keratinocytes, peaking at 4-24 h after irradiation. Large interindividual differences with respect to formation and repair of thymine-dimers as well as induction and duration of the p53 response were observed. Skin explants treated with topical sunscreen prior to UV-irradiation showed a clear reduction of thymine-dimers and p53 expression. The epidermal UV-responses and repair kinetics in organ-cultured skin were similar to what was found in vivo. Our data suggest that organ-cultured skin provides a valuable tool for studies of UV-induced epidermal responses in chronically sun-exposed skin.",

An extended period of exposure (up to 24 h) was required for maximum uptake of sunscreens and for inhibition of cell growth. Melano-cytes and fibroblasts tended to be more resistant than tumor cell lines (melanoma, cervical carcinoma). Sunscreens had no major effects on the transcription of certain genes, as judged by the activity of reporter constructs driven by the p53, c-fos and metal response (sheep metallothionein Ia promoter) elements and transfected into a human melanoma cell line (MM96L). The activity of the cytomegalovirus promoter was also not affected. A cell line (CI80-13S) with mitochondrial dysfunction was significantly more sensitive to growth inhibition by EHMC and PABA than the other cell lines tested. Treatment of MM96L with the mitochondrial inhibitor ethidium bromide sensitized the cells to killing by cotreatment with sunscreens, in association with increased cellular uptake of ethidium bromide.

Biological activity was first demonstrated in melanoma cell lines and was confirmed in mice bearing human melanoma xenografts. These in vivo studies also established a favorable safety margin for betulinic acid, as systemic side effects were not observed at any dose. Recently, considerable in vitro evidence has demonstrated that betulinic acid is effective against small- and non-small-cell lung, ovarian, cervical, and head and neck carcinomas. Published data suggest that betulinic acid induces apoptosis in sensitive cells in a p53- and CD95-independent fashion. While the precise molecular target and mechanism of action remain elusive and are the focus of a number of ongoing research programs, accumulated experimental evidence indicates that betulinic acid functions through a mitochondrial-mediated pathway. Supplemental reports suggest that the generation of reactive oxygen species, inhibition of topoisomerase I, activation of the MAP kinase cascade, inhibition of angiogenesis, and modulation of pro-growth transcriptional activators and aminopeptidase N activity may play a role in betulinic acid-induced apoptosis. These potential mechanisms of action may enable betulinic acid to be effective in cells resistant to other chemotherapeutic agents.

It is believed that the widespread habit of betel quid chewing is an important risk factor as it exposes the oral mucosa to known carcinogens. It also induces physical abrasions, which may create mitogenic environments during wound healing as gateways for infections. A recent study from our laboratories identified human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, mostly of the high-risk types HPV-16 and HPV-18, in 67 of 91 oral cancer lesions from a cohort of Indian patients consisting mostly of betel quid users. This suggested a viral etiology of some lesions but tumorigenesis in the absence of viruses in other lesions. Here, we examined whether the p53 gene, whose function is abrogated by the product of the HPV gene E6, would be mutated in those oral cancers that were free of HPV DNA, and we found point mutations at known hot spots for mutational alteration of p53 in 4 of 23 lesions. We also considered the possibility that p21, a target of regulation by the p53 protein, may be mutationally altered in tumors with a functional p53 gene. While we did not identify mutations in the p21 gene, 6 of 11 lesions contained a polymorphism that may be associated with cancer. Interestingly, 3 of 23 lesions had mutations in the p16 gene, a third regulator of the cell cycle which is frequently mutated in melanoma but rarely in other cancers, with 1 lesion even having a mutation in the p53 as well as in the p16 gene. Our data point to p53 and p16 as gene targets of oral carcinogenesis, with chemicals in the betel quid possibly functioning in these tumors as carcinogens.",

Its action has been compared with that of two topoisomerase II-targetted drugs, etoposide and doxorubicin.;The NZM3 melanoma and HCT116 colon carcinoma cell lines, each expressing wild-type p53, were cultured and responses were compared by flow cytometry, electrophoresis, microscopy, and growth of tumour xenografts.;Responses of NZM3 cells to all three drugs, as measured by histone H2AX γ-phosphorylation, induction of the p53 pathway and cell cycle arrest, were comparable and typical of those of topoisomerase II poisons. Xenografts of NZM3 cells responded to SN 28049 with a tumour growth delay of 16 days. In contrast, HCT116 cells had an attenuated DNA damage response to the drugs and SN 28049 had no in vivo activity, consistent with low topoisomerase II activity. However, SN 28049 inhibited HCT116 cell growth in vitro and activated the p53 pathway to induce a state with G(2)/M-phase DNA content, low mitotic index and a high proportion of binucleate cells. Treated cells expressed cyclin E and the senescence marker β-galactosidase but showed low expression of cyclin B and survivin. In comparison, etoposide caused little p53 expression or cycle arrest, and doxorubicin had an intermediate effect.;The action of SN 28049 in NZM3 cells is typical of a topoisomerase II poison, but the low topoisomerase IIα activity of HCT116 cells allowed the detection of a second antiproliferative action of SN 28049 in which cells undergo post-mitotic cycle arrest and induction of p53.",

It is activated by diverse stimuli, such as growth factors, nutrients, energy and stress signals, and essential signalling pathways, such as PI3K, MAPK and AMPK, in order to control cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC2 is considered resistant to rapamycin and is generally insensitive to nutrients and energy signals. It activates PKC-α and AKT and regulates the actin cytoskeleton. Deregulation of multiple elements of the mTOR pathway (PI3K amplification/mutation, PTEN loss of function, AKT overexpression, and S6K1, 4EBP1 and eIF4E overexpression) has been reported in many types of cancers, particularly in melanoma, where alterations in major components of the mTOR pathway were reported to have significant effects on tumour progression. Therefore, mTOR is an appealing therapeutic target and mTOR inhibitors, including the rapamycin analogues deforolimus, everolimus and temsirolimus, are submitted to clinical trials for treating multiple cancers, alone or in combination with inhibitors of other pathways. Importantly, temsirolimus and everolimus were recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, PNET and giant cell astrocytoma. Small molecules that inhibit mTOR kinase activity and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors are also being developed.

The impact of ARF on the E2F proteins may provide a mechanism for p53-independent ARF activity on cell cycle progression and tumor susceptibility. In this report we explored the effects of ARF on E2F ubiquitination and degradation in relationship to cell cycle effects and p53 status. We now show that ARF induced the rapid ubiquitination and degradation of E2F-1 only in the presence of functional p53. E2F-1 continued to be ubiquitinated following ARF induction in cycling p53-wild-type, p21-null cells, showing that effects of ARF were not simply a result of p14ARF induced cell-cycle arrest.

In this study, TUNEL assay and flow cytometric analysis also indicate that one of the causes of A375-S2 cell death induced by oridonin was apoptosis. The cell death was preceded by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Twelve hours after treatment with oridonin, the ratio of Bax/Bcl-xL protein expression was increased and release of cytochrome c was decreased by an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK inhibitor (PD98059) and a phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3-K) inhibitor (wortmannin). A mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) inhibitor, decylubiquinone, suppressed the release of cytochrome c without affecting Bax expression. The activation of p53 by oridonin was also blocked by wortmannin. In addtion, PD98059 and wortmannin significantly decreased oridonin-induced DNA fragmentation, but the p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) did not after DNA fragmentation. Oridonin induced A375-S2 cell apoptosis by activating parallel p53 and ERK pathways, increasing the ratio of Bax/Bcl-xL protein expression, and promoting the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, resulting in apoptotic cell death.",

Diverse neoplastic lesions, including colon cancer and melanoma-derived cells lines, expressed both Tn and STn antigen due to loss-of-function mutations in Cosmc. In addition, two human cervical cancer specimens that showed expression of the Tn/STn antigens were also found to have mutations in Cosmc and loss of heterozygosity for the cross-linked Cosmc locus.

MYC has been reported to protect cells from apoptosis activation but also to sensitize cells to apoptotic stimuli. We have previously demonstrated that the down-regulation of Myc protein activates apoptosis in melanoma cells and increases the susceptibility of cells to various antitumoral treatments. Beyond the well-known role in the G1-->S transition, MYC is also involved in the G2-M cell cycle phases regulation.;In this study we have investigated how MYC could influence cell survival signalling during G2 and M phases. We used the microtubules damaging agent paclitaxel (PTX), to arrest the cells in the M phase, in a p53 mutated melanoma cell line with modulated Myc level and activity. An overexpression of Myc protein is able to increase endoreduplication favoring the survival of cells exposed to antimitotic poisoning. The PTX-induced endoreduplication is associated in Myc overexpressing cells with a reduced expression of MAD2, essential component of the molecular core of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), indicating an impairment of this checkpoint. In addition, for the first time we have localized Myc protein at the spindle poles (centrosomes) during pro-metaphase in different cell lines.;The presence of Myc at the poles during the prometaphase could be necessary for the Myc-mediated attenuation of the SAC and the subsequent induction of endoreduplication. In addition, our data strongly suggest that the use of taxane in antitumor therapeutic strategies should be rationally based on the molecular profile of the individual tumor by specifically analyzing Myc expression levels.",

Rho GTPase pathways display functional redundancy in developmental events, including axon guidance. Therefore, their roles can often be masked when using simple loss-of-function genetic approaches. As a complement to loss-of-function genetics, we constructed a constitutively activated CDC-42(G12V) expressed in C. elegans neurons. CDC-42(G12V) drove the formation of ectopic lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions in the PDE neurons, which resembled protrusions normally found on migrating growth cones of axons. We then used a candidate gene approach to identify molecules that mediate CDC-42(G12V)-induced ectopic protrusions by determining if loss of function of the genes could suppress CDC-42(G12V). Using this approach, we identified 3 cytoskeletal pathways previously implicated in axon guidance, the Arp2/3 complex, UNC-115/abLIM, and UNC-43/Ena. We also identified the Nck-interacting kinase MIG-15/NIK and p21-activated kinases (PAKs), also implicated in axon guidance. Finally, PI3K signaling was required, specifically the Rictor/mTORC2 branch but not the mTORC1 branch that has been implicated in other aspects of PI3K signaling including stress and aging. Our results indicate that multiple pathways can mediate CDC-42-induced neuronal protrusions that might be relevant to growth cone protrusions during axon pathfinding. Each of these pathways involves Rac GTPases, which might serve to integrate the pathways and coordinate the multiple CDC-42 pathways. These pathways might be relevant to developmental events such as axon pathfinding as well as disease states such as metastatic melanoma. ",

Adduct-specific enzymes, such as T4 endonuclease V, various base excision repair enzymes, UvrABC nuclease, and chemical cleavage techniques can be used to convert the adducts into DNA strand breaks. The positions of these breaks are then detected by LMPCR. This method has been used primarily to map the distribution of UV-induced DNA lesions and adducts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The number and diversity of mutations in the p53 mutation database provides indirect evidence that environmental mutagens may be involved in human carcinogenesis. We hypothesize that there is a limited involvement of selection for specific mutations in the central domain of the p53 protein, and that the distribution of DNA damage along the p53 gene caused by environmental carcinogens can be correlated with the mutational spectra, i.e. hotspots and types of mutations, of certain cancers. This concept has been validated by experiments with sunlight and the cigarette smoke component benzo[a]pyrene representing the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon class of carcinogens. The damage and repair data obtained for these mutagens can predict certain parameters of the mutational spectra of human non-melanoma skin cancers and lung cancers from smokers. Future studies with suspected mutagens may help to implicate causative agents involved in other cancers, where the exact carcinogen has not yet been identified but an environmental factor is suspected.",

        "Doc_abstract":"In vitro exposure of tumorigenic cell lines to the chemotherapeutic agent PALA (N-(phosphonoacetyl)-L-aspartate) usually results in cell death (shown here to be apoptosis), followed by clonal growth of rare survivors. On the other hand, normal diploid cells respond to PALA by arresting in G1 and G2 of the cell cycle. It was previously suggested that growth control mechanisms might exist to prevent cells from entering S phase under toxic conditions and that genes involved in such mechanisms were mutated or deleted in tumor cells. Interestingly, the tumor suppressor gene p53, a putative G1 control gene, was shown to mediate PALA-induced growth arrest. However, growth arrest occurs in cells that lack wild-type p53, suggesting that other genes are involved as well. To identify these genes, we have generated whole cell hybrids between mouse melanoma and normal human fibroblast cells. At early passage, a whole cell hybrid (BHF12) responds to PALA with growth arrest, while at later passage, the same hybrid undergoes apoptosis. To determine which human chromosomes are required for the PALA-induced growth arrest phenotype, we isolated subclones of the hybrid and tested them for their PALA response. FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification have been used to identify the human chromosome content of BHF12 and its subclones. Several human chromosomes, in addition to chromosome 17 (the location of p53), are consistently associated with the growth arrest phenotype.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanoma antigen A (MAGE-A) proteins comprise a structurally and biochemically similar sub-family of Cancer/Testis antigens that are expressed in many cancer types and are thought to contribute actively to malignancy. MAGE-A proteins are established regulators of certain cancer-associated transcription factors, including p53, and are activators of several RING finger-dependent ubiquitin E3 ligases. Here, we show that MAGE-A2 associates with MDM2, a ubiquitin E3 ligase that mediates ubiquitylation of more than 20 substrates including mainly p53, MDM2 itself, and MDM4, a potent p53 inhibitor and MDM2 partner that is structurally related to MDM2. We find that MAGE-A2 interacts with MDM2 via the N-terminal p53-binding pocket and the RING finger domain of MDM2 that is required for homo/hetero-dimerization and for E2 ligase interaction. Consistent with these data, we show that MAGE-A2 is a potent inhibitor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2, yet it does not have any significant effect on p53 turnover mediated by MDM2. Strikingly, however, increased MAGE-A2 expression leads to reduced ubiquitylation and increased levels of MDM4. Similarly, silencing of endogenous MAGE-A expression diminishes MDM4 levels in a manner that can be rescued by the proteasomal inhibitor, bortezomid, and permits increased MDM2/MDM4 association. These data suggest that MAGE-A proteins can: (i) uncouple the ubiquitin ligase and degradation functions of MDM2; (ii) act as potent inhibitors of E3 ligase function; and (iii) regulate the turnover of MDM4. We also find an association between the presence of MAGE-A and increased MDM4 levels in primary breast cancer, suggesting that MAGE-A-dependent control of MDM4 levels has relevance to cancer clinically.

However, the radiation-related risk for skin cancer among atomic bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is primarily derived from the excess risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), with no demonstrable excess in squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma. The BCCs in this cohort are therefore unusual in being potentially attributable to two types of radiation-UV and ionizing (IR). BCCs have been associated with PTCH and/or p53 tumor suppressor gene alterations. To investigate the roles of these genes in relation to IR and UV exposures, we analyzed both genes in BCC samples from atomic bomb survivors. We examined 47 tumors, of which 70% had non-silent base-substitution p53 mutations independent of IR or UV exposure. However, the distribution of mutation type depends on UV and/or IR exposure. For example, C-to-T transitions at CpG sites adjacent to pyrimidine-pyrimidine (PyPy) sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-exposed than UV-shielded body areas and CpG-mutations at non-PyPy sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-shielded body areas with high-IR (>or=1 Gy) than low-IR (<0.2 Gy) exposure. And notably, although p53 deletion-frequencies demonstrated no IR-dose associations, deletions at the PTCH locus were more frequent (79% versus 44%) in tumors with high-IR than low-IR exposure. Moreover, 60% of high-IR tumors harbored both p53 and PTCH abnormalities compared with 23% of low-IR tumors. Therefore, alteration of both genes is likely to play a role in radiation-induced basal cell carcinogenesis.",

We have developed an aerosol system utilizing a cationic polymer, polyethyleneimine (PEI), for topical gene delivery to the lungs as a novel approach for treatment of lung cancer. Using a B16-F10 murine melanoma model in C57BL/6 mice, we previously demonstrated that aerosol delivery of PEI-p53 DNA resulted in highly significant reductions in the tumor burden (P < .001) in treated animals, and also lead to about 50% increase in the mean length of survival of the mice-bearing B16-F10 lung tumors. The mechanisms of this antitumor effect of p53 are investigated in this report. Here, we demonstrate that the p53 transfection leads to an up-regulation of the antiangiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) in the lung tissue and the serum of the mice. Furthermore, there is a down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the lung tissue and serum of the B16-F10 tumor-bearing mice treated with PEI-p53 DNA complexes, compared with untreated tumor-bearing animals. In addition, staining for von Willebrand factor (vWF), a marker for the angiogenic blood vessels, revealed that p53 treatment leads to a decrease in the angiogenic phenotype of the B16-F10 tumors. Immunohistochemistry for transgene expression reveals that the PEI-p53 aerosol complexes transfect mainly the epithelial cells lining the airways, with diffuse transfection in the alveolar lining cells, as well as, the tumor foci in the lung tissue. There was also some evidence of apoptosis in the lung tumor foci of animals treated with p53. The data suggest that aerosol delivery of PEI-p53 complexes leads to inhibition of B16-F10 lung metastases, in part by suppression of angiogenesis.",

Data from refractory cancer patients in a Phase I clinical trial with CM101 indicated a similar mechanism of tumor-targeted inflammation. To further our understanding of the mechanism of action of CM101 as an antitumor agent, we examined the role of the inflammatory response in inducing tumor apoptosis in a normal mouse and tumor-bearing mouse model. The i.v. infusion of CM101 into B16BL-6 melanoma tumor-bearing mice elevated p53 mRNA in circulating leukocytes as measured by reverse transcription-PCR, and immunohistochemistry demonstrated infiltration and sequestration of leukocytes. Whole tumor lysates from excised tumors exhibited an increase in binding to the murine p21(Waf1/Cip1) derived p53 DNA binding sequence compared with control whole tumor lysates, in which minimal or no DNA binding was observed. CM101 infusion led to elevated levels of Fas protein within the tumors as well as a decrease in the expression of fas ligand (fasL). Furthermore, tumors were apoptotic as determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling and DNA fragmentation assays. Collectively, these data suggest that CM101 up-regulates p53 in tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, initiating a loss of tumor immunoprivilege and consequently rendering the tumor sensitive to Fas/fasL-mediated apoptosis. CM101 induced loss of tumor immunoprivilege through changes in the expression of leukocyte p53, tumor Fas and fasL coupled with neovascularitis and leukocyte infiltration, constitutes a plausible molecular pathway for tumor reduction observed in cancer patients.",

Ircinin-1 treatment on SK-MEL-2 cells resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth and induced apoptotic cell death. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that ircinin-1 resulted in G1 arrest in cell cycle progression which was associated with a marked decrease in the protein expression of D-type cyclins and their activating partners Cdk 4 and 6 with concomitant inductions of p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1. The induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 appears to be transcriptionally upregulated and is p53-independent. In addition, ircinin-1 suppressed the phosphorylation of pRb protein and increased the co-association of pRb or proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) with p21WAF1/CIP1 in these cells. Ircinin-1 treatment also resulted in induction of apoptosis as determined by morphological changes, DNA fragmentation, alternated ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, cleavages of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and PLC-gamma1, and flow cytometric analysis. Ircinin-1 also induced cytochrome c release, cleavage activations of caspase-3 and -9, and upregulation of Fas and Fas-L. Even though the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) was expressed in ircinin-1-untreated or -treated SK-MEL-2 cells, only the level of cIAP-1, but not XIAP or cIAP-2, was decreased during ircinin-1-induced apoptosis at Western blot and RT-PCR studies.

Exponentially growing cells were exposed to two pairs of isoeffective doses (at surviving levels 10% and 1%) of 240-kV X-rays and 5.8-MeV neutrons. 1-8 days after irradiation, the frequency of apoptosis in adherent cells was assessed by two-parameter flow cytometric analysis with a DNA-dye-exclusion annexin-V-binding assay as well as by morphological examination with DAPI staining.;Apoptosis was induced most significantly 6-7 days after irradiation. The time courses, as well as the magnitudes of apoptosis induction, after isoeffective doses of X-rays and neutrons with respect to loss of colony-forming ability appeared to be comparable. RBE values in the range of 4-5 were estimated for apoptosis 4-8 days after irradiation by both the annexin V assay and morphological examination.;Radiation-induced apoptosis depends on ionization density in the same way as cell inactivation in general does, i.e., the RBE is similar, and the ratio of cells dying by apoptosis to cells dying otherwise does not depend on radiation quality.",

The antiapoptotic property of HIF-1 is mediated by means of transcriptional upregulation of the tyrosinase family member TYR-2 in the ASJ sensory neurons. TYR-2 is secreted by ASJ sensory neurons to antagonize CEP-1-dependent germline apoptosis. Knock down of the TYR-2 homologue TRP2 (also called DCT) in human melanoma cells similarly increases apoptosis, indicating an evolutionarily conserved function.

The many clinical phase II studies with new drugs led to the identification of taxotere as a new active agent against soft tissue sarcomas. Similar impressive results, such as those obtained with isolated limb perfusion in melanoma, have been reported in limb sarcomas with an identical regimen. The activity of ifosfamide in pretreated patients, administered at an increased dose, is suggestive of dose dependency. The improved results in phase II studies of dose-intensive chemotherapy with the support of colony-stimulating factors are encouraging and these regimens are now being investigated in the adjuvant setting.",

The phosphorylase is a housekeeping enzyme involved in the purine and amino acid metabolism whose activity is evidentiable in all the normal tissues. Chromosomal deletions encompassing both MTAPase and p16INK4 genes cause the total absence of the enzymatic activity only in malignant cells, thus resulting in defined metabolic differences between malignant and normal cells. MTAPase deficiency was investigated by direct radiochemical assay method and by immunochemical techniques in 35 different human malignant cell lines established from several tumor types. The enzyme-deficient cells derived from breast, lung, ovary and liver cancer, malignant melanomas, malignant gliomas and liposarcomas. Two of the MTAPase-deficient cell preparations (from a liver carcinoma and from a melanoma) are primary cultures thus directly representing the original cancer genotypes. Several of the MTAPase-negative cells were studied for p16INK4 gene deletions and for p16INK4 protein deficiency. In all the examined samples a full correlation exists between the lack of MTAPase and that of p16INK4. A similar result was obtained analysing extracts of Vero cell line, which is a fibroblast MTAPase-negative cell line established from the kidney of a normal adult monkey. Conversely, Cos cells, which also are fibroblasts derived from monkey kidney, show both MTAPase and p16INK4 protein. These results: (i) demonstrate that the phosphorylase deficiency is distributed among almost all the most important human cancers; (ii) confirm and extend the tumor types were p16INK4 gene inactivation is observable and (iii) suggest that deletions at 9p21 (in humans) or at syntenic chromosomes (in other species) might represent a general mechanism of p16INK4 gene loss of function and possibly, in turn, of cancer development and/or progression.",

Accordingly, multiple studies have examined the potential value of these enzymes as targets for cancer therapy. Unfortunately, most clinical trials with MMP inhibitors have yielded negative results which has made necessary to re-evaluate the role of these proteases in cancer. Recent works mainly based on the use of mouse models deficient in specific MMPs have revealed that these enzymes play many roles in cancer distinct from matrix destruction, influencing early steps of tumor evolution, and expanding their pro-tumorigenic properties. However, these in vivo studies have also shown that, unexpectedly, some MMP family members like MMP8 may have paradoxical anti-tumor functions. Nevertheless, the final validation of these MMPs as bona fide tumor suppressors requested the identification of the putative genetic or epigenetic changes underlying their inactivation during cancer development. To this purpose, very recent large-scale genomic studies have explored the possibility that MMPs could be genetically altered in a panel of human malignant tumors from different sources. These studies have demonstrated that MMP8 is a frequently mutated gene in human melanoma. Functional analysis of the identified mutations has confirmed that all of them lead to the loss-of-function of MMP8 and enhance the progression of melanoma, thus providing definitive evidence that MMP8 is a tumor-suppressor gene. Parallel studies have extended these findings to other MMP-related metalloproteinases such as ADAMTS15, which has been found to be genetically inactivated in human colorectal cancer. This review describes the identification and validation of some MMPs and related enzymes as anti-tumor proteases and speculates about the molecular mechanisms underlying their protective roles in tumor development. Finally, the review explores the clinical applications derived from the identification of MMPs that favour the host instead of the tumor.",

In the present study, we performed a clinicopathologic analysis and investigated p16 and cyclin D1 expression by immunohistochemistry in 14 cases. Furthermore, we investigated genetic changes of various tumor suppressor genes and an oncogene, including p16INK4a/p14ARF, p53, beta-catenin, and APC, in 11 cases. The 5-year overall survival rate in all the patients was 33.3%. A high mitotic rate was a significant adverse prognostic factor (P = 0.004). Decreased expression of p16 was observed in 4 (28.6%) of 14 cases. Overexpression of cyclin D1 was observed in 9 cases (64.3%). SSCP analysis followed by DNA direct sequencing revealed point mutations of the p16INK4a gene in 2 of 11 cases (18.2%). In addition, one case with the p14ARF mutation and 2 cases with the p53 mutation were observed. None of the cases harbored mutation of the beta-catenin or APC gene. Homozygous deletion of the p16INK4a/p14ARF gene was detected in one case. Methylation-specific PCR did not reveal hypermethylation of the p16INK4a/p14ARF promoter region in any of the cases. Three cases harbored genetic alterations of the p16INK4a/p14ARF gene (27.3%). All tumors with genetic alterations of the p16INK4a/p14ARF or p53 gene showed a high mitotic rate or tumor necrosis.

However, many cancers remain resistant to TRAIL. To overcome TRAIL resistance, combination therapies using sensitizers of the TRAIL pathway would be an efficacious approach. To investigate potential sensitizers of TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we used TRAIL-resistant human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cells as a model system. So far, HTLV-1-associated ATL is incurable by presently known therapies. Here, we show that wogonin and the structurally related natural flavones apigenin and chrysin break TRAIL resistance in HTLV-1-associated ATL by transcriptional down-regulation of c-FLIP, a key inhibitor of death receptor signaling, and by up-regulation of TRAIL receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2). This effect is mediated through transcriptional inhibition of the p53 antagonist murine double minute 2 (Mdm2), leading to an increase in p53 levels and, consequently, to up-regulation of the p53 target gene TRAIL-R2. We also show that these flavones can sensitize to TNFα- and CD95-mediated cell death. Furthermore, we show that wogonin, apigenin, and chrysin also enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in other human cancer cell lines including breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, colon cancer cell line HT-29, hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, melanoma cell line SK-MEL-37, and pancreatic carcinoma cell line Capan-1 by the same mechanism.

Recent results from our laboratory demonstrate that Apaf-1 has an apoptosis-unrelated function that may well account for its role as a tumor suppressor. The knockout of apaf-1 (in mice), the knockdown of Apaf-1 (in human cells) and loss of function mutations of ced-4 (the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of Apaf-1) compromise the arrest of DNA synthesis in response to DNA damage, in a context in which apoptosis does not occur.

        "Doc_abstract":"It has been well established that sometimes cancer clusters within specific families. This has suggested the possibility that some of those families might carry genetic defects which provide susceptibility to specific cancers. Retinoblastoma, an embryonal tumor of the eye represents an extreme example of a tumor which has a dramatic genetic component. Several studies have shown that inactivation at the retinoblastoma gene is probably both necessary and sufficient to initiate retinoblastoma formation. Patients who survive the inherited form of the disease are at risk of developing mesenchymal tumors, melanoma and brain tumors in as high as 10% of the patients before they are 40 years old. Because the product of the retinoblastoma gene, p105Rb, is expressed in all cell types, the obvious question is what accounts for these tissue specific differences in the role of p105Rb. Small cell lung carcinomas virtually all have associated mutations in the Rb gene and yet those tumors do not occur at a significantly increased frequency in patients with the hereditary form of retinoblastoma. In order to identify genes which might predispose to some of the more common adult malignancies, we have focused on one form of hereditary breast cancer. We chose a rare form of hereditary breast cancer which occurs in families with sarcomas (Li-Fraumeni Syndrome). By use of the candidate gene approach we tested which germ line p53 mutations were found in affected family members with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS). We have found that virtually all of the families with LFS have germ line p53 mutations, and that these tumors have undergone inactivation of the remaining wild-type p53 allele. In order to investigate the role of germ line p53 mutations outside of these rare families, we have begun to investigate other high risk groups. These results indicate that de novo germ line p53 mutations certainly occur in these high risk groups. These findings along with the recognition of the germ line p53 mutations in families with LFS provide clues about the importance of uncovering hidden susceptibilities from germ line tumor suppressor genes not only for the care of patients, but also for understanding the primary events that normally regulate the growth of cells in various tissue.",

We here propose that elevated temperature, as found in sunburn areas, may contribute to skin carcinogenesis as well. Continuous exposure of immortal human HaCaT skin keratinocytes (possessing UV-type p53 mutations) to 40 degrees C reproducibly resulted in tumorigenic conversion and tumorigenicity was stably maintained after recultivation of the tumors. Growth at 40 degrees C was correlated with the appearance of PARP, an enzyme activated by DNA strand breaks and the level corresponded to that seen after 5 Gy gamma-radiation. Concomitantly, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analyis demonstrated that chromosomal gains and losses were present in cells maintained at 40 degrees C while largely absent at 37 degrees C. Besides individual chromosomal aberrations, all tumor-derived cells showed gain of chromosomal material on 11q with the smallest common region being 11q13.2 to q14.1. Cyclin D1, a candidate gene of that region was overexpressed in all tumor-derived cells but cyclinD1/cdk4/cdk6 kinase activity was not increased. Thus, these data demonstrate that long-term thermal stress is a potential carcinogenic factor in this relevant skin cancer model, mediating its effect through induction of genetic instability which results in selection of tumorigenic cells characterized by gain of 11q.",

In mouse macrophages, transfected DNA or infection with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) can trigger cell death via the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome. In this article, we show that nonmyeloid human cell types lacking a functional AIM2 inflammasome still die in response to cytosolic delivery of different DNAs or infection with MVA. This cell death induced by foreign DNA is independent of caspase-8 and carries features of mitochondrial apoptosis: dependence on BAX, APAF-1, and caspase-9. Although it does not require the IFN pathway known to be triggered by infection with MVA or transfected DNA via polymerase III and retinoid acid-induced gene I-like helicases, it shows a strong dependence on components of the DNA damage signaling pathway: cytosolic delivery of DNA or infection with MVA leads to phosphorylation of p53 (serines 15 and 46) and autophosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM); depleting p53 or ATM with small interfering RNA or inhibiting the ATM/ATM-related kinase family by caffeine strongly reduces apoptosis. Taken together, our findings suggest that a pathway activating DNA damage signaling plays an important independent role in detecting intracellular foreign DNA, thereby complementing the induction of IFN and activation of the AIM2 inflammasome.",

Here it is reported that other, but not all, larger oligonucleotides induce the pigmentation response even more efficiently than pTpT. A 9 base oligonucleotide (p9mer) stimulated pigmentation in Cloudman S91 murine melanoma cells to 6-times the level of control cells while a 5 base oligonucleotide (p5mer#1) was inactive. In addition, the p9mer increased p21 mRNA levels and inhibited cell proliferation to a greater degree than did pTpT, consistent with the presumptive mechanism of action involving p53. Smaller, truncated versions of the p9mer also stimulated pigmentation, although to a lesser extent than did the p9mer. The ability of these oligonucleotides to stimulate pigmentation was highly dependent on the presence of a 5' phosphate group on the molecule, which was shown by confocal microscopy and fluorescent activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis to greatly facilitate the uptake of these oligonucleotides into the cells. Although the melanogenic activity of the oligonucleotides was directly related to increased length and 5' phosphorylation, nucleotide sequence is also critical because a p20mer was efficiently internalized yet was a poor inducer of pigmentation.",

IFIH1 is causal in type 1 diabetes based on the protective associations of four rare variants, where the derived alleles are predicted to reduce gene expression or function. Originally, however, T1D protection was mapped to the common IFIH1 nsSNP, rs1990760 or Thr946Ala. This common amino acid substitution does not cause a loss of function and evidence suggests the protective allele, Ala(946), may mark a haplotype with reduced expression of IFIH1 in line with the protection conferred by the four rare loss of function alleles. We have performed allele specific expression analysis that supports this hypothesis: the T1D protective haplotype correlates with reduced IFIH1 transcription in interferon-β stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (overall p = 0.012). In addition, we have used multiflow cytometry analysis and quantitative PCR assays to prove reduced expression of IFIH1 in individuals heterozygous for three of the T1D-associated rare alleles: a premature stop codon, rs35744605 (Glu627X) and predicted splice variants, rs35337543 (IVS8+1) and rs35732034 (IVS14+1). We also show that the nsSNP, Ile923V, does not alter pre-mRNA levels of IFIH1. These results confirm and extend the new autoimmune disease pathway of reduced IFIH1 expression and protein function protecting from T1D.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Skin cancer is the most common human malignancy, and sunlight exposure is known to play a role in its genesis. Ultraviolet B (UVB) (300-320 nm) has long been considered responsible for the skin damage underlying these cancers, whereas the toxicity of UVA (320-400 nm) has been largely overlooked The intimate mechanisms of photocarcinogenicity remain poorly understood, but UV-induced DNA damage appears to be a major initiating event. Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine (6-4) photoproducts (6-4PPs) are the main dimeric lesions induced by UVB, whereas the genotoxic effects of UVA have long been attributed to oxidative damage, the main lesion being the oxidized base 8-oxo-7,8dihydroguanine (8-oxoGua). However; powerful new techniques for analyzing DNA damage (the Comet assay, and especially HPLC-MSIMS) have demonstrated that UVA irradiation mainly triggers the formation of CPDs, especially CPD-TT both in cell models and in total human skin. A direct photochemical process is currently thought to account for CPD induction by UVA. The multilayer structure of the epidermis protects against UVB-induced dipyrimidine lesions in total skin but offers only weak protection against UVA. In addition, repair efficiency is undermined by UVA. CPDs, the main DNA lesions induced by UVA in total skin (which is more permeable to UVA), are inefficiently repaired CPDs have strong mutagenic potential, and recent studies clearly show that CPDs, rather than 8-Oxo-Gua, are the main mutagenic photoproducts induced by UVA. The UV signature of induced mutations is characterized by transitions from C to T or CC to TT in dipyrimidine sequences. These mutations target the p53, patched 1 and SMO genes in carcinomas, and the PTEN RAC1, PPP6C, STK19 and PPP6C genes in melanomas of exposed skin. UVA also mainly induces CPDs in melanocytes, in amounts similar to those observed in keratinocytes, demonstrating that melanin does not prevent CPD formation. In contrast, UVA induces far more abundant 8-oxo-Gua production in melanocytes than in keratinocytes. Thus, under UVA irradiation, oxidative stress contributes more to DNA damage in melanocytes than in keratinocytes. In addition, baseline oxidative damage (in the absence of UVA) is already higher in melanocytes. The photosensitizer may be melanin itself. This is supported by a recent study based on a murine model, in which melanoma induction was shown to require both UVA and the presence of melanin in melanocytes, and is associated with oxidative damage to DNA. Conversely, UVB was found to initiate melanoma through a direct, pigment-independent pathway. Thus, two wavelength-dependent pathways can induce melanoma, with melanin playing an unexpected role. Constitutive pigmentation is very effective in preventing UV-induced damage, and a clear correlation can thus be found between, on the one hand, the amount of CPD TT produced by both UVB and UVA and, on the other hand, the minimum erythematous dose and the phototype. Melanin is thus a two-facetted molecule, protecting the skin when its synthesis is complete and when melanosomes take on their nucleus-protective geometric configuration in keratinocytes, but having a pro-oxidant action when only partially polymerized and exposed to UV Repeated exposure of volunteer skin shows that a tan induced by UVB provides little protection against DNA damage caused by subsequent exposure, while tanning with UVA provides no protection at all. Yet both UVB and UVA provoke DNA damage. All these recent data highlight the potential role of UVA in skin carcinogenesis, and reinforce epidemiological studies showing an increased risk of melanoma among users of tanning lamps, particularly young women. The decision by the International Agency for Research on Cancer to classify UVA and tanning devices as group 1 carcinogens, and the opinion issued by the French National Academy of Medicine on tanning booths, therefore appear to be fully justified. The use of tanning salons should be permanently banned",

The functions of p14(ARF) are closely linked with its subcellular distribution. Nucleolar p14(ARF) dampens ribosome biosynthesis and nucleoplasmic forms of p14(ARF) activate the p53 pathway and induce cell cycle arrest. p14(ARF) can also be recruited to mitochondria where it interacts with many mitochondrial proteins, including Bcl-x(L) and p32 to induce cell death. It has been suggested that the movement of p14(ARF) to mitochondria requires its interaction with p32, but we now show that the ARF-p32 interaction is not necessary for the accumulation of p14(ARF) in mitochondria. Instead, highly hydrophobic domains within the amino-terminal half of p14(ARF) act as mitochondrial import sequences. We suggest that once this hydrophobic pocket is exposed, possibly in a stimulus-dependent manner, it accelerates the mitochondrial import of p14(ARF). This allows the interaction of p14(ARF) with mitochondrial proteins, including p32 and enables p53-independent cell death.",

BA-induced apoptosis involves the activation of caspases that cleave poly(ADP ribose)polymerase. Interactions of death ligand/receptor pairs of the CD95/CD95 ligand family do not mediate BA-induced caspase activation. BA enhances the levels of BAX and BCL-2 proteins but does not alter the levels of BCL-xS or BCL-xL. Ectopic expression of BCL-2 prevents BA-induced caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and cell death. Furthermore, BA induces the formation of reactive oxygen species that are essential for BA-triggered cell death. The generation of reactive oxygen species is blocked by BCL-2 and requires new protein synthesis but is unaffected by caspase inhibitors, suggesting that BA toxicity sequentially involves new protein synthesis, formation of reactive oxygen species, and activation of crm-A-insensitive caspases.",

The Rap2B protein shares ~90% homology with Rap2A, and its sequence is 70% identical to other members of the Rap family such as RaplA and RaplB. As a result, Rap2B has been theorized to have similar signaling effectors to the GTPase-binding protein Rap, which mediates various biological functions, including the regulation of sterile 20/mitogen-activated proteins. Since its identification in the early 1990s, Rap2B has elicited a considerable interest. Numerous studies indicate that Rap2B exerts specific biological functions, including binding and stimulating phospholipase C-ε and interferon-γ. In addition, downregulation of Rap2B affects the growth of melanoma cells. The present review summarizes the possible effectors and biological functions of Rap2B. Increasing evidence clearly supports the association between Rap2B function and tumor development. Therefore, it is conceivable that anticancer drugs targeting Rap2B may be generated as novel therapies against cancer.",

In addition, antibody to p53 was applied in each case to define the incidence of p53 positivity among these various tumor types. Each of the ES cases was MIC2 positive; each of the other cases was MIC2 negative. Positivity for bcl-2 was confined to two cases, one of them a malignant lymphoma (85% of cells positive) and one an ONB (5% of cells positive). Small numbers of scattered p53-positive cells appeared in the majority of cases studied, without regard for the specific tumor type; only a single case, a malignant lymphoma, showed a majority (approximately 90%) of p53-positive cells. These results indicate that the MIC2 antibody is a useful method by which to distinguish ES from a variety of other round cell lesions that may be encountered in the sinonasal region. The practical applications of antibody to bcl-2 and p53 seem to be much more limited; by contrast, neither bcl-2 positive cells nor abundant p53 cells identified by immunohistochemical analysis seemed to be frequent findings in any of the tumor types studied. Although ONBs have been included with the peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors for classification purposes, these tumors diverge from the ES/primitive neuroectodermal tumor family in that they do not seem to share either the MIC2 positivity or the t(11;22) chromosomal translocation that typify the ES/primitive neuroectodermal tumor family of lesions. Although bcl-2 positivity has been associated with a light microscopic finding of an unfavorable histologic pattern in retroperitoneal neuroblastomas, it does not seem that bcl-2 positivity in ONB will select for a clinically distinctive subset of patients.",

UVR plays a variety of roles in the induction of skin cancers. It can serve as a complete carcinogen or as a promoter of carcinogenesis. The typical UV-induced DNA damage is the generation of dimeric photoproducts between adjacent pyrimidine bases. Tumor suppressor gene p53 is a common target of UVR-induced mutations. There is a proliferative advantage of p53 mutant keratinocytes over normal keratinocytes that eventuates in neoplastic transformation. While UVB causes considerable DNA damage in the skin, UVA has only recently been shown to induce pyrimidine dimers and oxygen and nitrogen reactive species which damage DNA, proteins and lipids. The immunosuppressive effect of UVR contributes to its carcinogenic activity. Finally, any one of these effects of UVR may contribute to the induction of skin cancers by other agents such as X-rays, viruses, or chemical carcinogens. The mechanism by which UVR leads to cutaneous malignant melanoma is less clear and it may be a cofactor rather than an initiator of this tumor. Primary prevention of UVR exposure is the most effective means of reducing UVR carcinogenesis. Systemic retinoids may influence the appearance of new tumors in patient populations at increased risk of developing NMSC such as xeroderma pigmentosum and organ transplant recipients, but their efficacy is hindered by their side effects.",

Systematic investigation of the pathways impacted by the loss of function of neurofibromin (encoded byNF1) and merlin (encoded byNF2) have led to therapeutic advances for patients with NF1 and NF2. In the syndrome of SWN, the genetic landscape is more complex, with 2 known causative genes (SMARCB1andLZTR1) accounting for up to 50% of familial SWN patients. The understanding of the molecular underpinnings of these syndromes is developing rapidly and offers more therapeutic options for the patients. In addition, common sporadic cancers harbor somatic alterations inNF1(ie, glioblastoma, breast cancer, melanoma),NF2(ie, meningioma, mesothelioma) andSMARCB1(ie, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors) such that advances in management of syndromic tumors may benefit patients both with and without germline mutations.

In human adulthood, syntenin gain-of-function is increasingly associated with various cancers and poor prognosis. Depending on the cancer model analyzed, syntenin affects various signaling pathways. We previously have shown that syntenin allows syndecan heparan sulfate proteoglycans to escape degradation. This indicates that syntenin has the potential to support sustained signaling of a plethora of growth factors and adhesion molecules. Here, we aim to clarify the impact of syntenin loss-of-function on cancer cell migration, growth, and proliferation, using cells from various cancer types and syntenin shRNA and siRNA silencing approaches. We observed decreased migration, growth, and proliferation of the mouse melanoma cell line B16F10, the human colon cancer cell line HT29 and the human breast cancer cell line MCF7. We further documented that syntenin controls the presence of active β1 integrin at the cell membrane and G1/S cell cycle transition as well as the expression levels of CDK4, Cyclin D2, and Retinoblastoma proteins. These data confirm that syntenin supports the migration and growth of tumor cells, independently of their origin, and further highlight the attractiveness of syntenin as potential therapeutic target.

We describe a technique that minimizes the amount of tissue excised and uses definitive paraffin sections interpreted in a pathology laboratory in order to delay reconstruction until after clear oncologic margins are obtained. This 'delayed reconstruction after pathology evaluation (DRAPE)' technique is particularly directed at extensive and complicated skin lesions, located in areas of the body that can be difficult to reconstruct and are prone to disfigurement and/or loss of function. A review of the literature is undertaken, establishing the role of each technique in achieving clear surgical margins. A case example is presented, highlighting the role of the DRAPE approach. The DRAPE technique is presented as a useful option for high-risk lesions, especially within aesthetically sensitive regions or for complex reconstructions, and when reconstruction can be reasonably delayed while tumour clearance is established.",

Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) signaling through the tyrosine-kinase receptor, MET, is capable of promoting the proliferation, increasing the motility, and maintaining high tyrosinase activity and melanin synthesis of melanocytes in vitro. In addition, transgenic mice that ubiquitously overexpress HGF/SF demonstrate hyperpigmentation in the skin and leptomenigenes and develop melanomas. To investigate whether HGF/ SF-MET signaling is involved in the development of neural crest-derived melanocytes, transgenic embryos, ubiquitously overexpressing HGF/SF, were analyzed. In HGF/SF transgenic embryos, the distribution of melanoblasts along the characteristic migratory pathway was not affected. However, additional ectopically localized melanoblasts were also observed in the dorsal root ganglia and neural tube, as early as 11.5 days post coitus (p.c.). We utilized an in vitro neural crest culture assay to further explore the role of HGF/SF-MET signaling in neural crest development. HGF/SF added to neural crest cultures increased melanoblast number, permitted differentiation into pigmented melanocytes, promoted melanoblast survival, and could replace mast-cell growth factor/Steel factor (MGF) in explant cultures. To examine whether HGF/SF-MET signaling is required for the proper development of melanocytes, embryos with a targeted Met null mutation (Met-/-) were analysed. In Met-/- embryos, melanoblast number and location were not overtly affected up to 14 days p.c. These results demonstrate that HGF/SF-MET signaling influences, but is not required for, the initial development of neural crest-derived melanocytes in vivo and in vitro.",

Moreover, physalin A-induced apoptosis was triggered by activation of p53-Noxa pathway and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The administration of ROS scavengers NAC and GSH resulted in the complete inhibition of physalin A-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. Application of p53 inhibitor PFT-α or transfection with Noxa-siRNA could also lead to the same results. Autophagy, demonstrated by the punctuate distribution of monodansylcadaverine staining, as well as the change of LC3-II/LC3-I proportion and Beclin 1 activation, played a protective role against apoptosis via up-regulation of the p38-NF-κB survival pathway in A375-S2 cells.

Over the past few years, the mechanisms of cellular responses to UV radiation have received unprecedented attention. Understanding how skin cells respond to UV radiation will undoubtedly help decipher what goes wrong in a variety of clinical skin disorders including skin cancer and will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies. In the past decade, studies have established that UV radiation induces multifarious signal transduction pathways, some of which lead to apoptotic cell death, while others protect against this process. In this review, we summarize some of the most recent progresses regarding the involvement of multiple signal pathways in UV radiation-induced apoptosis in skin cells, especially in keratinocytes.

The mechanism of antitumor activity of GLme comprised inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death mediated by upregulated p53 and inhibited Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, the antitumor effect of the GLme was associated with intensified production of reactive oxygen species, whereas their neutralization by the antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine, resulted in partial recovery of cell viability.

We investigated the potential roles of these genes in spermatogenesis by generating a mouse model with a 210-kb genomic deletion encompassing six members of the Magea gene cluster (Magea1, Magea2, Magea3, Magea5, Magea6 and Magea8). Male mice carrying the deletion displayed smaller testes from 2 months old with a marked increase in apoptotic germ cells in the first wave of spermatogenesis. Furthermore, we found that Magea genes prevented stress-induced spermatogenic apoptosis after N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) treatment during the adult stage. Mechanistically, deletion of the Magea gene cluster resulted in a dramatic increase in apoptotic germ cells, predominantly spermatocytes, with activation of p53 and induction of Bax in the testes.

The majority of tumors studied were p63-, including all cases of angiosarcoma, lipomatous neoplasms, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, solitary fibrous tumor, schwannoma, neurofibroma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and leiomyosarcoma. Nuclear p63 reactivity was found in a subset of soft tissue myoepithelioma and myoepithelial carcinoma of soft tissue, cellular neurothekeoma, soft tissue perineurioma, Ewing sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumor, diffuse-type giant cell tumor, and giant cell tumor of soft parts. Infrequent, weak, or focal p63-staining patterns were observed in low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, proximal-type epithelioid sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, atypical fibroxanthoma, and spindle cell melanoma. Absent p63 expression is typical for most soft tissue tumors, including most (but not all) that would be in the differential diagnosis of spindle cell squamous carcinoma.",

In this study, the authors investigated the antimetastatic potential of nomilin and its possible mechanism of action. Metastasis was induced in C57BL/6 mice through the lateral tail vein using highly metastatic B16F-10 melanoma cells. Administration of nomilin inhibited tumor nodule formation in the lungs (68%) and markedly increased the survival rate of the metastatic tumor-bearing animals. These results correlated with the biochemical parameters and histopathological analysis. Nomilin showed an inhibition of tumor cell invasion and activation of matrix metalloproteinases. Treatment with nomilin induced apoptotic response, characterized by an increase in the sub-G1 fraction of cells with chromatin condensation and membrane blebbing, a typical ladder of DNA fragmentation, and detection of apoptotic cells by TUNEL assay. Nomilin treatment also exhibited a downregulated Bcl-2 and cyclin-D1 expression and upregulated p53, Bax, caspase-9, caspase-3, p21, and p27 gene expression in B16F-10 cells. Proinflammatory cytokine production and gene expression were found to be downregulated in nomilin-treated cells.

Thus, cell-surface Hsp90 may play a unique role in tumor metastasis, distinct from but perhaps overlapping with its intracellular function.

Recently, we have mechanically selected and grown highly malignant and tumorigenic tumor-repopulating cells (TRCs), a small sub-population of cancer cells, by culturing single cancer cells in soft fibrin matrices. However, it is unclear what regulates TRC growth besides Sox2. Here we show that nuclear protein 1 (Nupr1), a protein independent of Sox2, is downregulated in TRCs of melanoma, ovarian cancer and breast cancer cultured in soft fibrin matrices. Nupr1 expression depends on nuclear translocation of YAP that is enriched at the Nupr1 promoter sites; YAP is controlled by Cdc42-mediated F-actin and Lats1 interactions. Nupr1 regulates tumor-suppressor p53 and negatively regulates Nestin and Tert that are independent of Sox2 and promote TRC growth. Silencing Nupr1 increases TRC growth and Nupr1 overexpression inhibits TRC growth in culture and in immune-competent mice. Our results suggest that Nupr1 is a suppressor of growth of highly tumorigenic TRCs and may have a critical role in cancer progression. ",

Complete sequence analysis of these samples demonstrated a missense mutation in exon 5 (K144I) and exon 7 (V255A) from HCC samples B6-21 and B6-2, respectively. A putative splice site mutation was also detected in intron 3 from sample B6-2. Both B6-21 and B6-2 were previously shown to contain missense mutations in the coding sequences of the p53 gene. Functional studies with the two missense mutations demonstrated that while mutation V255A in exon 7 resulted in a loss of phosphatase activity, mutation K144I in exon 5 retained its phosphatase activity. Additionally, we identified a silent mutation (P96P) in exon 5 of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene from HCC sample B6-22.

However, the contribution of the ER to the early stages of normal cell transformation is largely unknown. Using primary human melanocytes and biopsies of human naevi (moles), we show that the extent of ER stress induced by cellular oncogenes may define the mechanism of activation of premature senescence. Specifically, we found that oncogenic forms of HRAS (HRAS(G12V)) but not its downstream target BRAF (BRAF(V600E)), engaged a rapid cell-cycle arrest that was associated with massive vacuolization and expansion of the ER. However, neither p53, p16(INK4a) nor classical senescence markers--such as foci of heterochromatin or DNA damage--were able to account for the specific response of melanocytes to HRAS(G12V). Instead, HRAS(G12V)-driven senescence was mediated by the ER-associated unfolded protein response (UPR). The impact of HRAS on the UPR was selective, as it was poorly induced by activated NRAS (more frequently mutated in melanoma than HRAS). These results argue against premature senescence as a converging mechanism of response to activating oncogenes and support a direct role of the ER as a gatekeeper of tumour control.",

Inactivation of mutated oncogenes, such as ras, or re-expression of inactive suppressor genes, such as p53 have been used as strategies for anti-tumor therapy. Additionally, exogenious genes, such as viral thymidine kinase that metabolize chemotherapeutic agents to achieve local cytotoxicity have also been employed.

Subsequently, PCL was found to simultaneously induce A375 cell apoptosis and autophagy. The mechanism of apoptosis following treatment with PCL involved regulation of Bax, Bcl-x(L) and Bcl-2 proteins, which then caused collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to cytochrome c release and caspase activation. The treatment with PCL also abrogated the glutathione antioxidant system, and induced mitochondria to generate massive ROS accumulation, which subsequently resulted in p38 and p53 activation. Further experimental data confirmed that the ROS-p38-p53 pathway could be involved in the stimulation of autophagy, suggesting that autophagy may play a death-promoting role via the above-mentioned apoptotic pathway. In conclusion, these findings indicate that PCL induces both apoptosis and autophagy in cancer cells through a mitochondria-mediated ROS-p38-p53 pathway.",

We examined the expression of 17 kinds of TAA in 9 pancreatic cancer cell lines and 12 pancreatic cancer tissues. CTL responses to 23 epitopes derived from these TAAs were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), CTL, and tetramer assays in 41 patients, and factors affecting the immune responses were investigated. All TAAs were frequently expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, except for adenocarcinoma antigens recognized by T cells 1, melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE)-A1, and MAGE-A3.

To understand the role of KLF4 in human skin cancer and also to evaluate the expression of cyclin D1, p53, and p21(Waf1/Cip1) in relation to the expression of KLF4, we evaluated the pattern of KLF4 expression during UVB-induced skin tumor development in SKH-1 hairless mice and in human skin cancer. We also determined whether there are correlations between the expression of KLF4, cyclin D1, p53, and p21 and non-melanoma skin tumors. KLF4 expression was found in the basal layer of non-irradiated control murine skin. Chronic UVB irradiation caused a progressive decrease in KLF4 expression, which was substantially decreased in UVB-induced murine skin tumors. In human precancerous lesions, KLF4 expression was maintained in 64.3% of Bowen's disease samples and 90.0% of AK samples. In contrast, KLF4 expression was significantly reduced in human cancer lesions (p = 0.004). A positive correlation was found between the expression of KLF4 and p21(Waf1/Cip1) in AK, whereas there was a negative correlation between the expression of cyclin D1 and p21(Waf1/Cip1) in Bowen's disease. Thus, our results suggest that KLF4 may function as a tumor suppressor in the skin and that the deregulated expression of KLF4 in the context of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and cyclin D1 expression may be involved in skin tumorigenesis.",

Here we sought to determine if this cytotoxic effect could be restricted to transformed keratinocytes relative to their normal human epidermal keratinocyte (NHEK) counterparts, and ascertain a potential mechanistic basis for the selectivity. The NHEK cells proliferated much slower than the premalignant HaCaT and malignant COLO 16 keratinocytes, and exogenous uridine added to the culture medium did not affect this growth. Similarly, DHODH expression and the bioenergetic characteristics of the normal cells were markedly dissimilar from those observed in the transformed cells indicating that de novo pyrimidine synthesis was involved with keratinocyte proliferation. Moreover, a short-term exposure to TFN caused a wild-type p53 response in the NHEK cells illustrating that pyrimidine metabolic stress could regulate this tumor suppressor protein in the normal cells. TFN-induced apoptosis occurred primarily in S phase HaCaT cells. This cell death was sensitive to uridine, an antioxidant, and a caspase inhibitor, and the suppression of Bcl-X(L) and the induction of Mn superoxide dismutase preceded it. These events suggested that mitochondrial/redox stress was involved with the cytotoxic effect of TFN. Conversely, a long-term exposure to TFN caused G(0)/G(1) arrest in the NHEK cells, which supported a cytoprotective role for p53 against TFN-induced apoptosis. Together, these results propose that TFN could be useful in the prevention or therapy of non-melanoma skin cancers and possibly other hyperproliferative keratinocytic diseases.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The melanocortin (MC) system is probably the best characterized neuropeptide network of the skin. Most cutaneous cell types express MC receptors (MC-Rs) and synthesize MCs, such as alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), that act in autocrine and paracrine fashion. In human skin cells, activation of adenylate cyclase by MCs occurs at 10(-6)-10(-9) M doses of the ligand, but effects are induced in some cell types at subnanomolar concentrations. In addition to the pigmentary action of MCs on epidermal melanocytes, the hair follicle is a source and target for MCs. MCs regulate lipogenesis in sebocytes expressing both MC-1R and MC-5R. In adipocytes, lipid metabolism is modulated by agouti signalling protein, a natural MC-1R/MC-4R antagonist. The anti-inflammatory activity of alpha-MSH includes immunomodulatory effects on several resident skin cells and antifibrogenic effects mediated via MC-1R expressed by dermal fibroblasts. In human mast cells, alpha-MSH appears to be proinflammatory due to histamine release. alpha-MSH exhibits cytoprotective activity against UVB-induced apoptosis and DNA damage, a finding that helps explain the increased risk of cutaneous melanoma in individuals with loss of function MC-1R mutations. These findings should improve our understanding of skin physiology and pathophysiology and may offer novel strategies with MCs as future therapeutics for skin diseases.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) is a signaling program that enables cellular adaptation to stressful conditions like hypoxia and nutrient deprivation in the tumor microenvironment. An important effector of the ISR is activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in redox homeostasis and amino acid metabolism and transport. Because both inhibition and overactivation of the ISR can induce tumor cell death, modulators of ATF4 expression could prove to be clinically useful. In this study, chemical libraries were screened for modulators of ATF4 expression. We identified one compound, E235 (N-(1-benzyl-piperidin-4-yl)-2-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-7-carboxamide), that activated the ISR and dose-dependently increased levels of ATF4 in transformed cells. A dose-dependent decrease in viability was observed in several mouse and human tumor cell lines, and knockdown of ATF4 significantly increased the antiproliferative effects of E235. Interestingly, low μM doses of E235 induced senescence in many cell types, including HT1080 human fibrosarcoma and B16F10 mouse melanoma cells. E235-mediated induction of senescence was not dependent on p21 or p53; however, p21 conferred protection against the growth inhibitory effects of E235. Treatment with E235 resulted in an increase in cells arrested at the G2/M phase with a concurrent decrease in S-phase cells. E235 also activated DNA damage response signaling, resulting in increased levels of Ser15-phosphorylated p53, γ-H2AX, and phosphorylated checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2), although E235 does not appear to cause physical DNA damage. Induction of γ-H2AX was abrogated in ATF4 knockdown cells. Together, these results suggest that modulation of the ISR pathway with the small molecule E235 could be a promising antitumor strategy.",

The locus harbors the CDKN2A/ARF tumor suppressor gene, which encodes two cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin dependent kinase 2A (p16(INK4a)) and alternate reading frame (p14(ARF)). We have designed a real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) application to study homozygous deletion (HD) of CDKN2A/ARF in 186 urinary bladder cancer patients.;Real-time QPCR, based on simultaneous amplification of ARF and a reference gene, GAPDH, was developed and evaluated in three melanoma cell lines with HDs at the CDKN2A/ARF locus (IGR-1, SK-MEL-5, and WM-266-4). In addition, loss of heterozygosity was analyzed at the D9S942, D9S1748, and D12S99 markers. Mutation analysis of the CDKN2A/ARF gene was performed using single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing. Results from the present investigation were combined with previous p53 analysis of the same urinary bladder neoplasms.;Real-time QPCR analysis showed 26 (14%) HDs, 22 (12%) hemizygous deletions, and 3 (2%) multiple duplications. Loss of heterozygosity was determined in 30 (22%) cases at the D9S942 locus, which is located between E1alpha and E1beta of the CDKN2A/ARF gene. No association was established between occurrence of genetic aberrations at 9p21 and tumor stage or grade, supporting previous suggestions that CDKN2A/ARF inactivation is an early event in bladder carcinogenesis.;We have established a fast and efficient method for detection of HDs. Our data support the notion that inactivation, including HDs, of CDKN2A/ARF is an early event in transitional cell carcinoma. We observed separate and specific targeting of the CDKN2A and ARF genes, respectively, and that simultaneous inactivation of ARF and p53 occurs.",

In a three armed approach involving somatic cell fusions of C8161 with recipient lines of greater differentiation, different lineage, and different tumorigenicity status, the metastatic and undifferentiated phenotype of C8161 was promiscuously dominant. In somatic cell hybrids produced between the C8161 and a group of non-metastatic human melanoma lines which exhibited melanocyte differentiation markers including S100, HMB-45, NKI/C3, and melanin, the fusions were uniformly metastatic and undifferentiated. In somatic cell hybrids of C8161 and MCF-7 the fusions exhibited an estrogen independent and unresponsive, estrogen receptor (ER) negative, and highly metastatic phenotype. In fusions between C8161 and HMS-1, an immortalized 'benign' human myoepithelial line which produced an abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) and high levels of protease and angiogenic inhibitors including maspin, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1-AT), protease nexin II (PN-II), thrombospondin-1 and soluble basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) receptors, the hybrids showed complete absence of matrix, absent maspin expression, markedly decreased protease inhibitor and angiogenic inhibitor production, high levels of proteases and angiogenic factors, and a highly metastatic phenotype. In our somatic cell fusions, the human-human hybrids represented true and complete fusions and not hybrid clones selected for by loss of dominant-acting growth suppressor genes. This finding was supported by detailed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) studies, Q-banding karyotype analysis, and autofusions of representative clones. The purposeful creation of inherently unstable human-murine fusions between C8161 and B16-F1 where loss of putative suppressor loci would be expected, resulted in fusions exhibiting decreased growth and non-metastatic behavior with progressive chromosomal loss. Neither p53, nm23, DNA methyltransferase, activated ras, fibroblast growth factor-4 (FGF-4), or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mediated the acquisition of the metastatic or undifferentiated phenotype within the C8161-human fusions. These studies are the first studies ever to successfully transfer the complete metastatic phenotype by somatic cell fusion and support the presence of a new high level regulatory pathway(s) involving dominant trans-acting factors which act pleiotropically to regulate an undifferentiated and highly metastatic phenotype.",

Akt inhibitor decreased the viability of UV-irradiated cells which was treated with silymarin. In addition, the effect of UV irradiation on the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members [extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)] was also reversed by silymarin. Moreover, ERK inhibitor (PD98059) and p38 inhibitor (SB203580) augmented UV-induced apoptosis in silymarin treated A375-S2 cells.

The present study further defines a large LSKs in >8-week-old Mysm1(-/-) mice that exhibit increased proliferation and reduced cell lineage differentiation compared with those of WT LSKs. We found that IRF2 and IRF8, which are important for HSC homeostasis and commitment as transcription repressors, were expressed at lower levels in Mysm1(-/-) HSCs, and Mysm1 enhanced function of the IRF2 and IRF8 promoters, suggesting that Mysm1 governs the IRFs for HSC homeostasis.

We also show that 5 out of the 6 variants are entirely localised in the nucleus in contrast to the wild type LKB1/STK11, which is detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Finally we demonstrate that all 6 LKB1/STK11 variants, in contrast to wild type LKB1/STK11, are unable to suppress the growth of melanoma G361 cells.

To shed independent light on IRSp53 function we determined the localisations and dynamics of IRSp53 and WAVE2 in B16 melanoma cells. In cells spread well on a laminin substrate, IRSp53 was localised by antibody labelling at the tips of both lamellipodia and filopodia. The same localisation was observed in living cells with IRSp53 tagged with enhanced green florescence protein (EGFP-IRSp53), but only during protrusion. From the transfection of deletion mutants the N-terminal region of IRSp53, which binds active Rac, was shown to be responsible for its localisation. Although IRSp53 has been reported to regulate filopodia formation with Mena, EGFP-IRSp53 showed the same localisation in MVD7 Ena/VASP (vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein) family deficient cells.

In fact, miR-214 behaves as a key hub by coordinating fundamental signaling networks such as PTEN/AKT, β-catenin, and tyrosine kinase receptor pathways. Interestingly, miR-214 also regulates the levels of crucial gene expression modulators: the epigenetic repressor Ezh2, \"genome guardian\" p53, transcription factors TFAP2, and another microRNA, miR-148b. Thus, miR-214 seems to have essential roles in coordinating tumor proliferation, stemness, angiogenesis, invasiveness, extravasation, metastasis, resistance to chemotherapy, and microenvironment. The sum of current literature reports suggests that miR-214 is a molecular hub involved in the control of cancer networks and, as such, could be a potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarker and target for therapeutic intervention.

These tumor cells display different patterns of modulated oncogenes including both ras and p53 mutations. Here we demonstrate that the growth of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo is arrested by the expression of HIV-1 Vpr. Expression of Vpr in several human tumor cell lines upon transfection resulted in an accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of cell cycle with altered cellular morphology, including an increase in adherence, and growth arrest, consistent with a differentiated phenotype. Vpr expression in B78/H1 cells results in a marked reduction in colony formation in vitro and an associated reduction in melanin synthesis by the cells. Vpr-transfected melanoma cells inoculated into syngenic C57BL/6 mice showed a markedly reduced ability to form tumors in vivo.

Most of these tumors are sporadic and the genetic alterations responsible for their genesis take place over several cell generations; nevertheless, 5 to 10% of the human tumors are hereditary, with a rapid development. Cancer susceptibility genes have been classified as \"gatekeepers\" (e.g. RB1, ki-ras) and \"caretakers\" (e.g. hMLH1 and hMSH2, BRCA1). The first step in identifying individuals at high risk of developing a specific inherited form of cancer, and who should therefore undergo genetic tests, is the detailed construction of family history (an accurate cancer family history that includes at least three generation pedigrees, an appropriate cancer risk assessment and an effective genetic counseling). At present, the most useful methods of risk assessment are those performed on the following genes: BRCA1 and BRCA2 especially for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, hMLH1 and hMSH2 for hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer, APC for familial adenomatous polyposis, ret for medullary thyroid carcinoma, p53 for the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, p16 for melanoma and RB1 for retinoblastoma. In conclusion, the development of new diagnostic tests will permit a more accurate assessment of risk in individuals who have not so far shown any sign or symptom of the disease.",

We previously found that the RNA-binding protein NONO regulates the intra-S phase checkpoint and its silencing impaired HeLa and melanoma cell response to UV-induced DNA damage. Here we investigated the mechanisms underlying NONO regulation upon UVC treatment. We found that UVC rays induce the expression of mir320a, which can indeed target NONO. However, despite mir320a induction, NONO mRNA and protein expression are not affected by UVC. We found through RNA immunoprecipitation that UVC rays induce the ubiquitous RNA-binding protein HUR to bind NONO 5'UTR in a site overlapping mir320a binding site. Both HUR silencing and its pharmacological inhibition induced NONO downregulation following UVC exposure, whereas concomitant mir320a silencing restored NONO stability. UVC-mediated mir320a upregulation is triggered by p53 binding to its promoter, which lies within a region marked by H3K4me3 and H3K27ac signals upon UVC treatment. Silencing mir320a sensitizes cells to DNA damage. Overall our findings reveal a new mechanism whereby HUR protects NONO from mir320-mediated degradation upon UVC exposure and identify a new component within the complex network of players underlying the DNA damage response adding mir320a to the list of p53-regulated targets upon genotoxic stress.",

NAG-1 expression is substantially increased during cancer development and progression especially in gastrointestinal, prostate, pancreatic, colorectal, breast, melanoma, and glioblastoma brain tumors. Aberrant increases in the serum levels of secreted NAG-1 correlate with poor prognosis and patient survival rates in some cancers. In contrast, the expression of NAG-1 is up-regulated by several tumor suppressor pathways including p53, GSK-3β, and EGR-1. NAG-1 expression is also induced by many drugs and dietary compounds which are documented to prevent the development and progression of cancer in mouse models. Studies with transgenic mice expressing human NAG-1 demonstrated that the expression of NAG-1 inhibits the development of intestinal tumors and prostate tumors in animal models. Laboratory and clinical evidence suggest that NAG-1, like other TGF-β family members, may have different or pleiotropic functions in the early and late stages of carcinogenesis. Upon understanding the molecular mechanism and function of NAG-1 during carcinogenesis, NAG-1 may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer and a therapeutic target for the inhibition and treatment of cancer development and progression.",

Disturbances in these coordinated processes may accompany diseases such as cancer. We hypothesized that the p53 family member p73, which regulates cell differentiation in several contexts, may be important in vascular development. We demonstrate that p73 deficiency perturbed vascular development in the mouse retina, decreasing vascular branching, density and stability. Furthermore, p73 deficiency could affect non endothelial cells (ECs) resulting in reduced in vivo proangiogenic milieu. Moreover, p73 functional inhibition, as well as p73 deficiency, hindered vessel sprouting, tubulogenesis and the assembly of vascular structures in mouse embryonic stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell cultures. Therefore, p73 is necessary for EC biology and vasculogenesis and, in particular, that DNp73 regulates EC migration and tube formation capacity by regulation of expression of pro-angiogenic factors such as transforming growth factor-β and vascular endothelial growth factors. DNp73 expression is upregulated in the tumor environment, resulting in enhanced angiogenic potential of B16-F10 melanoma cells. Our results demonstrate, by the first time, that differential p73-isoform regulation is necessary for physiological vasculogenesis and angiogenesis and DNp73 overexpression becomes a positive advantage for tumor progression due to its pro-angiogenic capacity.

        "Doc_abstract":"It is well known that the radiosensitivity of tumor cells can be significantly reduced under hypoxic conditions. However, most of the reports in the literature refer to an experimental setup in which the supply of oxygen is kept low for a short period of time only. In tumors, chronic hypoxia would seem to be the more typical situation, because of an insufficient vascularization and the limited diffusion of oxygen into the tissue. Under such conditions, certain changes in the proliferation patterns of tumor cells, in which the cell cycle checkpoint protein p53 seems to play a role, have been shown to occur. We therefore decided to study radiosensitivity and cell cycle progression under conditions of chronic hypoxia in several human tumor cell lines differing in their p53 status.;Four human tumor cell lines (melanomas Be11 and MeWo and squamous carcinomas 4197 and 4451) were incubated for 3 h, 24 h, and 72 h under either oxic or hypoxic conditions and subsequently exposed to graded doses of X-rays. In some cases, cells were kept under hypoxia for the same periods of time, but then reoxygenated immediately before irradiation. Cell survival was assessed with the usual colony formation assay, and cell cycle distributions were determined by two-parameter flow cytometry after labeling with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU).;As expected, the oxygen enhancement ratio at 3 h was 2.0 or more in all cases. Differences, however, became evident with longer incubation times. At 24 h, the sensitivity of cells kept under hypoxic conditions both before and during irradiation was practically unchanged with cell lines Be11, 4197, and 4451, but clearly increased with MeWo. This resulted in an oxygen enhancement ratio of only 1.1 for the latter cell line when the sensitivity of aerated cells was used as reference. Cells kept under hypoxia for 24 h and reoxygenated shortly before irradiation, however, also showed an increase in sensitivity, so that the oxygen enhancement ratio based on differences in irradiation atmosphere alone was still around 2.0. At 72 h, the two p53 wild-type cell lines were not available for experiments, because they quickly degenerated under hypoxic conditions. Both mutant cell lines now showed similar results, the sensitivity being increased with irradiation under continued hypoxia as well as after reoxygenation. The oxygen enhancement ratios with reference to aerated cells were 1.3 and 1.5 for MeWo and 4451, respectively. Flow cytometric measurements after labeling with BrdU revealed that in all cell lines, the fraction of active S-phase cells during incubation tended to decrease under hypoxic conditions. Only in the p53 mutant cell lines, however, was this accompanied by an increase of the percentage of S-phase cells that were not actively incorporating BrdU.;It is suggested that these quiescent cells in the S-phase compartment develop because of a general breakdown of cellular energy metabolism. In the p53 mutant cells, this may lead to a cessation of cell cycle progression in all phases alike, because checkpoint control has been lost; p53 wild-type cells, on the other hand, settle down preferentially in G(1) under the same conditions. Independently of the p53 status, however, energy depletion may be the cause of a decreased ability to cope with radiation damage and thus the cause of the observed increase in radiosensitivity. This would become more easily apparent in the p53 mutant cell lines, because they are less sensitive than the p53 wild types to hypoxia as such.",

Macrophages constitute an essential component of innate immunity and have been shown to exhibit a phenotypic plasticity in response to various stimuli, which play a central role in both acute inflammation and wound repair. Osteoactivin (OA)/Glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB), a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a role in cell differentiation, survival, and angiogenesis. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential role of OA/GPNMB in macrophage-induced MSC function. We found that reparative M2 macrophages express significantly greater levels of OA/GPNMB than pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages. Furthermore, using loss of function and rescue studies, we demonstrated that M2 macrophages-secreted OA/GPNMB positively regulates the viability, proliferation, and migration of MSCs. More importantly, we demonstrated that OA/GPNMB acts through ERK and AKT signaling pathways in MSCs via CD44, to induce these effects. Taken together, our results provide pivotal insight into the mechanism by which OA/GPNMB contributes to the tissue reparative phenotype of M2 macrophages and positively regulates functional activities of MSCs.

Furthermore, we have shown that a peptide derived from the self-binding domain of the autophilic T15 antibody can be crosslinked to the Fc carbohydrate of monoclonal antibodies specific for the B-cell receptor of B-cell tumors.

A representative mixed isoprenoid, gamma-tocotrienol, suppresses the growth of murine B16(F10) melanoma cells, and with greater potency, the growth of human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) and human leukemic (HL-60) cells. beta-Ionone, a pure isoprenoid, suppresses the growth of B16 cells and with greater potency, the growth of MCF-7, HL-60 and human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells. Results obtained with diverse cell lines differing in ras and p53 status showed that the isoprenoid-mediated suppression of growth is independent of mutated ras and p53 functions. beta-Ionone suppressed the growth of human colon fibroblasts (CCD-18Co) but only when present at three-fold the concentration required to suppress the growth of Caco-2 cells. The isoprenoids initiated apoptosis and, concomitantly arrested cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Both suppress 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase activity. beta-Ionone and lovastatin interfered with the posttranslational processing of lamin B, an activity essential to assembly of daughter nuclei. This interference, we postulate, renders neosynthesized DNA available to the endonuclease activities leading to apoptotic cell death. Lovastatin-imposed mevalonate starvation suppressed the glycosylation and translocation of growth factor receptors to the cell surface. As a consequence, cells were arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This rationale may apply to the isoprenoid-mediated G1-phase arrest of tumor cells. The additive and potentially synergistic actions of these isoprenoids in the suppression of tumor cell proliferation and initiation of apoptosis coupled with the mass action of the diverse isoprenoid constituents of plant products may explain, in part, the impact of fruit, vegetable and grain consumption on cancer risk.",

For the new millennium, we have asked three general questions: (A) Do we know all possible strategies of nucleotide excision repair (NER) in all organisms? (B) How is NER integrated and regulated in cells and tissues? (C) Does DNA replication represent a new frontier in the roles of DNA repair? We make some suggestions for the kinds of answers the next generation may provide. The kingdom of archea represents an untapped field for investigation of DNA repair in organisms with extreme lifestyles. NER appears to involve a similar strategy to the other kingdoms of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but subtle differences suggest that individual components of the system may differ. NER appears to be regulated by several major factors, especially p53 and Rb which interact with transcription coupled repair and global genomic repair, respectively. Examples can be found of major regulatory changes in repair in testicular tissue and melanoma cells. Our understanding of replication of damaged DNA has undergone a revolution in recent years, with the discovery of multiple low-fidelity DNA polymerases that facilitate replicative bypass. A secondary mechanism of replication in the absence of NER or of one or more of these polymerases involves sister chromatid exchange and recombination (hMre11/hRad50/Nbs1). The relative importance of bypass and recombination is determined by the action of p53. We hypothesise that these polymerases may be involved in resolution of complex DNA structures during completion of replication and sister chromatid resolution. With these fascinating problems to investigate, the field of DNA repair will surely not disappoint the next generation.",

Investigators in the field of tumor immunology are currently utilizing at least three distinct approaches toward this goal. In the first approach, molecular targets of cytolytic T cells which spontaneously develop in tumor-bearing patients have been identified and are subsequently used as immunogens in immunotherapy trials. Whereas this approach originally focused upon the identification of tumor antigens in the immune-responsive tumors malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, it surprisingly led to the identification of a variety of molecules that are now known to be expressed in other common pediatric and adult tumors. In the second approach, tumor-specific molecules (eg, mutant p53 and chromosomal translocations) that have been identified in individual tumors during the study of neoplastic transformation are used as immunogens. Because chromosomal translocations are common in pediatric tumors, such targets may be of particular interest in pediatric oncology. In the third approach, immunization with whole tumor cell components is undertaken with the assumption that the most immunogenic molecules within the tumor will dominate the immune response induced. The benefits and limitations for each approach, particularly as it pertains to the development of immunotherapy for pediatric tumors, are discussed in this article.",

Unlike most members of the T-box family, TBX2 and TBX3 are the only mammalian T-box factors which function as transcriptional repressors, mediated by the repression domain in the C-terminal. In addition to a role in development, recent evidence suggests that TBX2 and TBX3 are overexpressed in a number of cancers, including melanoma, breast, liver, lung, pancreas, ovarian, and cervical cancers. However, there is little information about the mechanisms for how these T-box genes contribute to tumorigenesis. Upregulation of TBX2 and TBX3 suppresses the expression of p14(ARF) and p21(CIP1) and promotes bypass of senescence through inactivation of p53 pathway. TBX2 functionally interacts with pRb, and pRb modulates TBX2 functional specificity. In addition, TBX2 is a player of Wnt signaling while TBX3 is a downstream target of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, and overexpression of TBX2 and TBX3 represses the expression of E-cadherin, which is demonstrated to be a prerequisite for epithelial tumor cell invasion. Moreover, TBX2 is shown to interact with EGR1 to block multiple downstream tumor suppressors. Here, we review the current knowledge on TBX2 and TBX3 in tumorigenesis and prospect their special value for development of target-based anticancer drugs.",

In this study, we revealed that various metastatic cancer cells showed consistently higher levels of antiapoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2, nuclear factor-kappaB, MDM2, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and lower levels of proapoptotic proteins, including Bax and p53 than low metastatic parental cells. This was followed by chemo- and radioresistance in metastatic cancer cells compared with their parental cells. EGFR and DNA-PK activity, which are known to be associated with chemo- and radioresistance, were demonstrated to be mutually regulated by each other. Treatment with PKI166, an EGFR inhibitor, suppressed etoposide-induced activation of DNA-PK in A375SM metastatic melanoma cells. In addition, PKI166 enhanced markedly the chemosensitivities of metastatic cancer cell sublines to various anticancer drugs in comparison with those of low metastatic cancer cells. These results suggest that the activities of DNA-PK and EGFR, which is positively correlated with each other, may contribute to metastatic phenotype as well as therapy resistance, and the EGFR inhibitor enhances the effect of anticancer drugs against therapy-resistant metastatic cancer cells via suppression of stress responses, including activation of DNA-PK.",

The present work evaluated the effects of two antagonistic analogs of GHRH (MIA-604 and MIA-690) on the proliferation of U-87 MG GBM tumors, in vivo as well as in vitro. Both analogs were administered subcutaneously and dose-dependently inhibited the growth of tumors transplanted into nude mice (127 animals in seven groups). The analogs also inhibited cell proliferation in vitro, decreased cell size, and promoted apoptotic and autophagic processes. Both antagonists stimulated contact inhibition, as indicated by the expression of the E-cadherin-β-catenin complex and integrins, and decreased the release of humoral regulators of glial growth such as FGF, PDGFβ, and TGFβ, as revealed by genomic or proteomic detection methods. The GHRH analogs downregulated other tumor markers (Jun-proto-oncogene, mitogen-activated protein kinase-1, and melanoma cell adhesion molecule), upregulated tumor suppressors (p53, metastasis suppressor-1, nexin, TNF receptor 1A, BCL-2-associated agonist of cell death, and ifκBα), and inhibited the expression of the regulators of angiogenesis and invasion (angiopoetin-1, VEGF, matrix metallopeptidase-1, S100 calcium binding protein A4, and synuclein-γ).

We hypothesized that reducing susceptibility of T cells to activation-induced cell death (AICD), which increases during the rapid in vitro expansion of therapeutic T cells before their infusion, might improve the persistence of adoptively transferred cells. Our investigations revealed that repetitive stimulation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) induced AICD, as a result of activating the DNA damage response pathway through ATM-mediated Ser15 phosphorylation of p53. Activation of this DNA damage response pathway also occurred upon antigen-specific restimulation in TCR-transduced TIL1383I T cells prepared for adoptive transfer to patients as part of a clinical trial. Notably, treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) significantly reduced upregulation of the DNA damage marker γH2AX, subsequent ATM activation, and cell death. In the Pmel mouse model of melanoma, the presence of NAC during ex vivo T-cell expansion improved the persistence of adoptively transferred cells, reduced tumor growth, and increased survival. Taken together, our results offer a preclinical proof of concept for the addition of NAC to current therapeutic T-cell expansion protocols, offering immediate potential to improve the quality and therapeutic efficacy of adoptive T-cell therapeutics infused into patients.

A protective role for or, on the other hand, masking effects of such antibodies is still controversial. An indication that a serological response can be beneficial comes from vaccination studies. A significant association between the development of an anti-tumor antigen antibody response and prolonged survival was observed following vaccination of melanoma patients with GM2 or anti-idiotypic antibodies which molecularly mimic tumor-associated antigens.

These can be repaired by nucleotide excision repair or replicated by low fidelity class Y polymerases. Insufficient repair followed by errors in replication produce characteristic mutations in dipyrimidine sequences that may represent initiation events in carcinogenesis. Chronic exposure to UVB results in disruption of the epithelial structure and expansion of pre-malignant clones which undergo further genomic changes leading to full malignancy. Genetic diseases in DNA repair, xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome and trichothiodystrophy, show varied elevated symptoms of sun sensitivity involving skin cancers and other symptoms including neurological degeneration and developmental delays. In humans, only xeroderma pigmentosum shows high levels of cancer, but mouse strains, with any of the genes corresponding to these diseases knocked-out, show elevated skin carcinogenesis. The three major skin cancers exhibit characteristic molecular changes defined by certain genes and associated pathways.

In general, HPV-associated cancers arise from a single accidental integration event of the viral genome into a host cell chromosome. Integration is a terminal event for the viral life cycle. Even though integration does not occur at specific chromosomal hot spots in the human genome, it follows a consistent pattern with respect to the viral genome, and expression of the HPV E6 and E7 genes is consistently retained. The normal function of E6 and E7 is to establish and maintain a cellular milieu that allows for viral genome replication. E6 and E7 target important cellular growth regulatory circuits among them the p53 and retinoblastoma tumor suppressors, respectively. Uncontrolled expression of the E6 and E7 proteins, as a consequence of viral integration is paramount to the establishment and maintenance of the tumorigenic state.

Therefore, when these numbers are combined, familial BC risk accounts for approximately 20-25% of the total BC burden. However, because of the often limited information on family history in the etiologic assessment of BC, this may be an underestimate. Confounding factors include its phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity, given the association of HBC with a plethora of differing cancer syndromes. Its most common occurrence is its association with ovarian cancer in the so-called hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome due to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. More rarely, it occurs in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, caused by a p53 germline mutation, in which markedly early-onset BC is found in association with brain tumors, sarcomas, leukemia, lymphoma, malignant melanoma, and adrenal cortical carcinoma. Importantly, the age-adjusted incidence of BC in women in the United States fell sharply, by 6.7%, in 2003, when compared with the rate identified in 2002.

Bioinformatics analysis found this novel gene shares high homolog with Necdin (a neuronal growth suppressor, 49%). Both of them are basic proteins. Moreover, the Restin, Necdin and Mages are in one protein superfamily. This fact indicates that the Restin and Mages are mutually related but functionally different. Further analysis found that they can be divided into two subgroups, the acid and the basic. Restin, Necdin and Mage-D1 have an alkaline conserve region (PI is from 8.6 to 10.1), which are not or less expressed in tumor tissues but mostly in normal tissues. It has been reported that Necdin can arrest the cell proliferation by interaction with p53 and E2F1. Therefore, all of them are probably related to arrest the cell cycle.

In this study, we found that expression of miR-1908 was significantly downregulated in human NSCLC cell lines, including SK-MES-1, A549, and NCI-H460. Then the role of miR-1908 in NSCLC cell proliferation was explored. The miR-1908 mimic was transfected into NSCLC cell lines, and their proliferation was detected. MTT and Cell Titer-Blue H analyses showed that the cell proliferation was notably reduced by the miR-1908 mimic transfection. Moreover, we found the RP-p53 pathway was activated by miR-1908 mimic. Moreover, the miR-1908 inhibitor transfection had a completely opposite effect on the NSCLC cell proliferation than that of miR-1908 mimic. To explore the underlying mechanism of that, TargetScan bioinformatics server and 3'-UTR luciferase reporter assay were applied to identify the targets of miR-1908. Our results showed that AKT1 substrate 1 (AKT1S1), a newly proven suppressor of the RP-p53 pathway, was a target of miR-1908, suggesting a probable mechanism for miR-191 suppressing NSCLC cell proliferation.

As preliminary data on recently disclosed bendamustine esters suggested increased cytotoxicity, we investigated representative derivatives in more detail. Especially basic esters, which are positively charged under physiological conditions, were in the crystal violet and the MTT assay up to approximately 100 times more effective than bendamustine, paralleled by a higher fraction of early apoptotic cancer cells and increased expression of p53. Analytical studies performed with bendamustine and representative esters revealed pronounced cellular accumulation of the derivatives compared to the parent compound. In particular, the pyrrolidinoethyl ester showed a high enrichment in tumor cells and inhibition of OCT1- and OCT3-mediated transport processes, suggesting organic cation transporters to be involved. However, this hypothesis was not supported by the differential expression of OCT1 (SLC22A1) and OCT3 (SLC22A3), comparing a panel of human cancer cells. Bendamustine esters proved to be considerably more potent cytotoxic agents than the parent compound against a broad panel of human cancer cell types, including hematologic and solid malignancies (e.g. malignant melanoma, colorectal carcinoma and lung cancer), which are resistant to bendamustine.

The functional importance of the AR N/C interaction is supported by naturally occurring loss-of-function AR AF2 mutations where AR retains high-affinity androgen binding but is defective in AR FXXLF motif binding. Ligands with agonist activity in vivo such as testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and the synthetic anabolic steroids induce the AR N/C interaction and increase AR transcriptional activity in part by slowing the dissociation rate of bound ligand and stabilizing AR against degradation. AR ligand-binding domain competitive antagonists inhibit the agonist-dependent AR N/C interaction. Although the human AR N/C interaction is important for transcriptional activity, it has an inhibitory effect on transcriptional activity from AF2 by competing for p160 coactivator LXXLL motif binding. The primate-specific AR coregulatory protein, melanoma antigen gene protein-A11 (MAGE-A11), modulates the AR N/C interaction through a direct interaction with the AR FXXLF motif. Inhibition of AF2 transcriptional activity by the AR N/C interaction is relieved by AR FXXLF motif binding to the F-box region of MAGE-11.

In the past few years several groups have reported that jasmonates exhibit anti-cancer activity in vitro and in vivo and induce growth inhibition in cancer cells, while leaving the non-transformed cells intact. Recently, jasmonates were also discovered to have cytotoxic effects towards metastatic melanoma both in vitro and in vivo. Three mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain this anti-cancer activity. The bio-energetic mechanism - jasmonates induce severe ATP depletion in cancer cells via mitochondrial perturbation. Furthermore, methyl jasmonate (MJ) has the ability to detach hexokinase from the mitochondria. Second, jasmonates induce re-differentiation in human myeloid leukemia cells via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and were found to act similar to the cytokinin isopentenyladenine (IPA). Third, jasmonates induce apoptosis in lung carcinoma cells via the generation of hydrogen peroxide, and pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Combination of MJ with the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) and with four conventional chemotherapeutic drugs resulted in super-additive cytotoxic effects on several types of cancer cells. Finally, jasmonates have the ability to induce death in spite of drug-resistance conferred by either p53 mutation or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) over-expression. In summary, the jasmonates are anti-cancer agents that exhibit selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells, and thus present hope for the development of cancer therapeutics.",

This is because HSP90 is involved in maintaining the conformation, stability, activity and cellular localisation of several key oncogenic client proteins. These include, amongst others, ERBB2, C-RAF, CDK4, AKT/PKB, steroid hormone receptors, mutant p53, HIF-1alpha , survivin and telomerase hTERT. Therefore, modulation of this single drug target offers the prospect of simultaneously inhibiting all the multiple signalling pathways and biological processes that have been implicated in the development of the malignant phenotype. The chaperone function of HSP90 requires the formation of a multichaperone complex, which is dependent on the hydrolysis of ATP and ADP/ATP exchange. Most current inhibitors of HSP90 act as nucleotide mimetics, which block the intrinsic ATPase activity of this molecular chaperone. The first-in-class inhibitor to enter and complete phase I clinical trials was the geldanamycin analogue, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin. The results of these trials have demonstrated that HSP90 is a valid drug target. Evidence of clinical activity has been seen in patients with melanoma, breast and prostate cancer. This article provides a personal perspective of the present efforts to increase our understanding of the molecular and cellular consequences of HSP90 inhibition, with examples from work in our own laboratory. We also review the discovery and development of novel small-molecule inhibitors and discuss alternative approaches to inhibit HSP90 activity, both of which offer exciting prospects for the future.",

Terminally differentiated keratinocytes, namely the corneocytes, are continually shed from the surface of the skin, whereas immature cells produce progeny that proceed through the differentiation process. Notch signaling controls a number of cellular processes including cell fate decision, proliferation, differentiation and survival/apoptosis. Hence, Notch and its ligands are expressed in multiple tissues including the skin, where they are abundantly expressed in the epidermis. Notch activation results in the promotion of growth arrest and the onset of differentiation, therefore suggesting that specific Notch activation may regulate skin homeostasis by balancing these processes, i.e. Notch signaling functions as a molecular switch that controls the transition of cells between skin layers during the epidermal differentiation process. Recent advances in the study of Notch signaling have confirmed that there is cross-talk between the Notch signaling pathway and a variety of other signaling molecules including Sonic hedgehog (Shh), beta-catenin and the p53 family member, p63. The absence of Notch activity allows Wnt and Shh signaling to persist in a tissue where they are normally repressed. In addition, Notch counteracts the action of p63 to maintain immature cell characteristics. However, aberrant Notch signaling results in the development of psoriasis and skin cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. Future efforts to further define how Notch controls cell proliferation and differentiation may lead to the application of Notch in new therapies for various skin diseases.",

This imprinted region is implicated in the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a neurodevelopmental disorder, where NDN is one of multiple genes silenced by deletion, maternal uniparental disomy or translocation. Due to this association, much interest has focused on the role of NDN in neuronal development and differentiation. However, a considerable number of studies have identified additional functions of NDN. Taken together these studies suggest a pleiotropic protein with diverse functions some of which may be relevant to tumorigenesis. Downregulation of NDN occurs in carcinoma cell lines and primary tumors, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Our working hypothesis is that NDN is a worthy candidate for further studies with regard to a potential tumor suppressor role. In this article we outline the considerable evidence supporting the hypothesis that NDN has multiple functions, some of which indicate that it could be a tumor suppressor. The roles of NDN in key processes such as interaction with p53 and E2F-1, hematopoietic stem cell quiescence, transcriptional repression, angiogenesis, differentiation and interaction with the polycomb group gene BMI1 are discussed.

Interaction of this protein with the histone acetyl transferase complex plays a vital role in the regulation of multiple nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells response elements and thus in the regulation of innate immunity. Splice variants of ING4 have different binding affinities to target sites, which results in the enhancement of its functional diversity. ING4 is among the few known regulatory proteins that can directly interact with chromatin as well as with transcription factors. The influence of ING4 on tumor necrosis factor-α, keratinocyte chemoattractant, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, matrix metalloproteinases, cyclooxygenase-2, and IκBα expression clearly demonstrates its critical role in the regulation of inflammatory mediators. Its interaction with liprin α1 and p53 contribute to mitigate cell spreading and induce apoptosis of cancer cells. Multiple factors including breast cancer melanoma suppressor-1 are upstream regulators of ING4 and are frequently deactivated in tumor cells.

The adjuvant effects of inoculation of DNA encoding GM-CSF into skin were studied. Initial experiments examined whether the GM-CSF gene injected into the skin of mice could affect the density of epidermal DC (Langerhans cells). DNA encoding GM-CSF delivered by particle bombardment into skin resulted in a significant increase of epidermal DC at the inoculation site. Kinetic analysis of epidermal recruitment after GM-CSF inoculation showed an increase in DC that peaked at seven days. This increase was accompanied by recruitment of DC into draining lymph nodes. The adjuvant effects of DNA encoding GM-CSF inoculated into skin were measured by the ability to augment antibody and T-cell responses against poorly immunogenic tumor antigens. Peptide immunization at skin sites containing epidermal DC newly recruited by GM-CSF DNA elicited T-cell responses against mutant p53, whereas peptide immunization of control skin sites did not elicit any detectable T-cell responses.

Exogenous docosahexaenoic acid or eicosapentaenoic acid induced calcium release and ROS generation, and synergized with the analogs in vitro, while oleic acid had no such an effect. Gene expression analysis confirmed the induction of ER stress-mediated apoptosis pathway components, such as GADD153, ATF3, Luman/CREB3 and the ER-associated degradation-related HERPUD1 genes. Tumor suppressors, P53, LATS2 and ING3 were also up-regulated in various cell lines after drug treatment. Amino-phthalimides down-regulated the expression of CCL2, which is implicated in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis.;Because of the anticancer, anti-angiogenic action and the wide range of applicability of the immunomodulatory drugs, including thalidomide analogs, lipid droplet-binding members of this family could represent a new class of agents by affecting ER-membrane integrity and perturbations of ER homeostasis.",

In this article, we report the generation of a fiber-mutant Adv vector, using the Adv genomic DNA-terminal protein complex (DNA-TPC) cotransfection method. First, a fiber-mutant construct in a plasmid carrying the right-side two-thirds of the human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) genome (pTR) was cotransfected with Ad5 DNA-TPC, yielding the recombinant Adv with the desired fiber mutation. The DNA-TPC from the mutant Adv was then utilized to produce a second-step recombinant Adv with an expression cassette in the place of E1. By this procedure, we generated a fiber mutant, F/K20, that has a linker and a stretch of 20 lysine residues added at the C terminus of the fiber. By using Adv carrying a reporter lacZ gene (AxCAZ2) with either F/K20 or wild-type fiber (F/wt), we examined the transduction efficiency of F/K20-Adv. No significant difference in the transduction efficiency between F/K20 and F/wt-Adv was observed for a human fibroblast line, WI-38, or various tumor cell lines, including melanoma, prostate, esophageal, and pancreatic cancer lines. In clear contrast, F/K20-Adv showed a remarkably enhanced efficiency in genetic transduction of human glioma cells. In all four human glioma lines tested, the multiplicities of infection (MOIs) for transduction of 50% of the population (ED50) were decreased with F/K20-Adv compared with F/wt-Adv: 7-fold for T98G, 14-fold for U251, 9-fold for U373, and 42-fold for U87 cells. Therefore, we attempted to apply F/K20-Adv for gene therapy of malignant glioma. Glioma cells infected with F/K20-Adv carrying genes for interleukin 2 or interleukin 12 produced a high level of each cytokine at a much lower MOI than did cells infected with F/wt-Adv. Infection with F/K20-Adv carrying the wild-type p53 tumor suppressor gene resulted in an enhanced level of p53 protein expression and an increased incidence of F/K20-Adv in transduction efficiency for malignant glioma, providing promising tools for gene therapy.",

Given DNA-microarray data for a set of cells characterized by a given phenotype and for a set of control cells, an important problem is to identify \"patterns\" of gene expression that can be used to predict cell phenotype. The potential number of such patterns is exponential in the number of genes. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem based on a supervised learning algorithm, which differs substantially from previous schemes. It couples a complex, non-linear similarity metric, which maximizes the probability of discovering discriminative gene expression patterns, and a pattern discovery algorithm called SPLASH. The latter discovers efficiently and deterministically all statistically significant gene expression patterns in the phenotype set. Statistical significance is evaluated based on the probability of a pattern to occur by chance in the control set. Finally, a greedy set covering algorithm is used to select an optimal subset of statistically significant patterns, which form the basis for a standard likelihood ratio classification scheme. We analyze data from 60 human cancer cell lines using this method, and compare our results with those of other supervised learning schemes. Different phenotypes are studied. These include cancer morphologies (such as melanoma), molecular targets (such as mutations in the p53 gene), and therapeutic targets related to the sensitivity to an anticancer compounds. We also analyze a synthetic data set that shows that this technique is especially well suited for the analysis of sub-phenotype mixtures. For complex phenotypes, such as p53, our method produces an encouragingly low rate of false positives and false negatives and seems to outperform the others. Similar low rates are reported when predicting the efficacy of experimental anticancer compounds. This counts among the first reported studies where drug efficacy has been successfully predicted from large-scale expression data analysis.",

CIMP has been reported to be useful for predicting prognosis and response to treatment in a variety of tumor types, but it remains unclear whether or not CIMP is a universal phenomenon across human neoplasia or if there should be cancer-specific definitions of the phenotype. Recently, it was shown that somatic isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutations, frequently observed in gliomas, establish CIMP in primary human astrocytes by remodeling the methylome. Interestingly, somatic IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, and loss-of-function mutations in ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase-2 (TET2) associated with a hypermethylation phenotype, are also found in multiple enchondromas of patients with Ollier disease and Mafucci syndrome, and leukemia, respectively. These data provide the first clues for the elucidation of a molecular basis for CIMP. Although CIMP appears as a phenomenon that occurs in various cancer types, the definition is poorly defined and differs for each tumor. The current perspective discusses the use of the term CIMP in cancer, its significance in clinical practice, and future directions that may aid in identifying the true cause and definition of CIMP in different forms of human neoplasia.",

In order to increase tumor selectivity of replication, we prepared mutants from the avirulent strain Ulster with monocyclic replication cycle and adapted them for multicyclic replication in human melanoma cells. Two mutants (M1 and M2) showed interesting functional differences: while M2 showed T cell co-stimulatory effects in a tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assay, M1 did not. A distinct difference of these 2 virus mutants appeared also when testing their capacity to induce interferon-alpha and -beta as well as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) molecules in human monocytes. Sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) molecules of the 2 virus mutants showed 7 non-silent mutational differences. Upon cloning of the HN mutant genes into an expression vector and transfection of cells, only HN derived from M2 (HN-M2) was detected at the cell surface by immunostaining with specific antibodies and showed hemadsorption and neuraminidase activity. In order to define which amino acid was responsible for the loss of functional activity of HN derived from M1 (HN-M1), distinct HN mutants were generated via site-directed mutagenesis and tested. Substitution of serine 200 by a proline abrogated HN expression and its hemadsorption and neuraminidase activities. Molecular modeling revealed that proline 200 in HN influences flexibility of a loop near the entrance to the neuraminidase active site, a function that may be crucial for the functions of this viral protein.",

Individuals with loss-of-function mutations for the glypican 3 gene exhibit Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, a rare X-linked overgrowth disorder. Expression of glypican 3 mRNA and protein is normally silenced in most adult organs and may reappear during malignant transformation. In the past few years, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics of glypican 3 in hepatocellular carcinoma have been elucidated. More recently, glypican 3 has been emerging as a new diagnostic marker for germ cell tumors and especially testicular and ovarian yolk sac tumors. However, in other tumors such as renal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and melanomas, studies disagree on the level of glypican 3 expression. Finally, there is the controversial notion of glypican 3 as a tumor suppressor gene. In this review article, we update current knowledge on glypican 3 expression in normal and neoplastic tissues, evaluate its utility as a tumor marker in clinical practice, and explore its role as a novel oncofetal protein with clinical implications. Our focus is on the diagnostic value of glypican 3 in germ cell tumors and other neoplasms in addition to hepatocellular carcinoma. In conclusion, glypican 3 has been proven to be a useful immunohistochemical marker in distinguishing yolk sac tumors, choriocarcinomas, and Wilms tumors from other malignancies histologically mimicking these primitive tumors. Clinically, we recommend that glypican 3 be used as part of a panel of markers in subtyping testicular germ cell tumors. ",

We studied four kindreds with HGD and four kindreds with AS for abnormalities of the ACTH receptor (ACTHR) gene. The ACTHR coding sequence in all AS kindreds and two HGD kindreds was normal. Analysis of the ACTHR gene of the proband in one of the HGD kindreds showed him to be homozygous for the previously described G221T transition causing a Ser74Ile substitution of the protein, which has been shown to inactivate the ACTHR in signal transduction. The proband in another HGD kindred was found to be a compound heterozygote with the G221T transition in one allele and a novel C818A transition in the other allele of ACTHR. The C818A transition caused the substitution of the highly conserved Pro273 by His in the receptor protein. In vitro expression of the mutated ACTHR in mouse melanoma M3 cells showed that at a medium ACTH concentration of 3 nM, cells transfected with the wild-type ACTHR produced twofold and threefold, respectively, of the amount of intracellular cAMP when compared to cells transfected with the ACTHR carrying the Pro273His and the Ser74Ile mutation, respectively, confirming that HGD in this kindred is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the ACTHR.

Strategies to reduce the risk of cancer development in psoralen plus ultraviolet A-treated populations are highly desirable. In prior studies, we demonstrated that green tea and constituent polyphenols protect against ultraviolet B-induced carcinogenesis and reduce the growth rate of established tumors in skin. In this study, we show that pre- and post-treatment with standardized green tea extract in psoralen plus ultraviolet A treatment populations abrogates the psoralen plus ultraviolet A-induced photochemical damage to skin. Intact mouse and human skin and reconstituted human skin were employed to assess the effect of both topical and oral administration of standardized green tea extract against psoralen plus ultraviolet A-induced photodamage. Oral administration of standardized green tea extract prior to and during multiple psoralen plus ultraviolet A treatments reduced hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis in murine skin. Standardized green tea extract treatment also inhibited accumulation of c-fos and p53 protein induction following a single exposure to psoralen plus ultraviolet A. c-fos and p53 positive cells in psoralen plus ultraviolet A-treated skin were found to be increased by 55.4 +/- 13. 6% and 62.3 +/- 10.5%, respectively, compared with saline-treated unexposed control skin. Oral administration of 0.4 or 0.8% standardized green tea extract inhibited c-fos protein accumulation by 18.5% and 46.2% (p < 0.05), respectively, and p53 protein accumulation by 26.1% and 54.3% (p < 0.05), respectively. Similarly proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining, a marker of cell proliferation was induced (73.7%) in psoralen plus ultraviolet A-treated skin. Oral administration of 0.4% or 0.8% standardized green tea extract 1 d after psoralen plus ultraviolet A treatment was effective in reducing psoralen plus ultraviolet A-induced inflammatory responses including erythema and edema formation. When standardized green tea extract was applied to EpiDerm, a reconstituted human skin equivalent, psoralen plus ultraviolet A-induced 8-methoxypsoralen-DNA adduct formation and p53 protein accumulation were inhibited. Topical application of 0.2 mg 8-methoxypsoralen per cm2 followed by exposure to ultraviolet A (2.5 J per cm2) resulted in delayed erythema formation in human subjects. Pretreatment of human skin with topical application of 0.2 mg standardized green tea extract per cm2 30 min prior to psoralen plus ultraviolet A treatment resulted in an almost complete abrogation of psoralen plus ultraviolet A-induced erythema.

Thus, XP provides a unique model for the study of unrepaired DNA lesions, mutations and skin carcinogenesis. The high level of ras oncogene activation, Ink4a-Arf and p53 tumor suppressor gene modifications as well as alterations of the different partners of the mitogenic sonic hedgehog signaling pathway (patched, smoothened and sonic hedgehog), characterized in XP skin tumors have clearly demonstrated the major role of the UV component of sunlight in the development of skin tumors. The majority of the mutations are C to T or tandem CC to TT UV signature transitions, occurring at bipyrimidine sequences, the specific targets of UV induced lesions. These characteristics are also found in the same genes modified in sporadic skin cancers but with lower frequencies confirming the validity of studying the XP model.

Recent data have shown that IL-24 is secreted as a glycosylated protein and functions as a pro-Th1 cytokine and as a potent anti-angiogenic molecule. In this study, we analyzed the activity of Ad-mda7 and its protein product, secreted IL-24, against human breast cancer cells. We show that Ad-mda7 transduction of human breast cancer cells results in G(2)/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death, which correlates with secretion of IL-24 protein. Neutralizing antibody against IL-24 significantly inhibited Ad-mda7 cytotoxicity. IL-24 and IL-10 both engage their cognate receptors on breast cancer cells resulting in phosphorylation and activation of STAT3, however, IL-10 receptor binding failed to induce cell killing, indicating that tumor cell killing by IL-24 is independent of STAT3 phosphorylation. Treatment with exogenous IL-24 induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells and this effect was abolished by addition of anti-IL-24 antibody or anti-IL-20R1, indicating that bystander cell killing is mediated via IL-24 binding to the IL-20R1/IL-20R2 heterodimeric receptor complex. Co-administration of the related cytokine IL-10 inhibited killing mediated by IL-24 and concomitantly inhibited IL-24 mediated up-regulation of the tumor suppressor proteins, p53 and p27(Kip1).

Primary tumors and metastases derived from M3-9-M were studied for similarities to human ERMS, and for immunogenicity and immune responsiveness.;Primary and metastatic tumors develop after orthotopic injection of M3-9-M into immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, which mirror human ERMS with regard to histology, gene expression, and metastatic behavior. Whole cell vaccination using irradiated M3-9-M cells or M3-9-M-pulsed dendritic cells (DC)-induced tumor-specific T-cell responses that prevent tumor growth following low-dose tumor injection, and slow tumor growth following higher doses. Administration of anti-CD25 moAbs to deplete CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells prior to tumor vaccination enhanced the potency of the ERMS tumor vaccine. Adoptive immunotherapy with M3-9-M primed T cells plus DC-based vaccination resulted in complete eradication of day 10 M3-9-M derived tumors.;M3-9-M derived murine ERMS is immunogenic and immunoresponsive; regulatory T cells contribute to immune evasion by murine rhabdomyosarcoma.

Using a focused library of 51 DNA-damaging agents, we undertook a systematic screen using three different cell lines to determine which chemotherapeutics have their activity enhanced when combined with GNE-783. We found that GNE-783 was most effective at enhancing activity of antimetabolite-based DNA-damaging agents; however, there was a surprisingly wide range of activity within each class of agents. We, next, selected six different therapeutic agents and screened these in combination with GNE-783 across a panel of cell lines. This revealed a preference for enhanced chemopotentiation of select agents within tumor types, as, for instance, GNE-783 preferentially enhanced the activity of temozolomide only in melanoma cell lines. Additionally, although p53 mutant status was important for the overall response to combinations with some agents; our data indicate that this alone was insufficient to predict synergy. We finally compared the ability of a structurally related CHK1 inhibitor, GNE-900, to enhance the in vivo activity of gemcitabine, CPT-11, and temozolomide in xenograft models. GNE-900 significantly enhanced activity of only gemcitabine in vivo, suggesting that strong chemopotentiation in vitro can translate into chemopotentiation in vivo. In conclusion, our results show that selection of an appropriate agent to combine with a CHK1 inhibitor needs to be carefully evaluated in the context of the genetic background and tumor type in which it will be used.",

Irradiation with UVA to HaCaT keratinocytes was shown to cause the formation of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), translocation of phosphatidylserine in the inner layer into the outer layer of cell membrane, and lowering of a mitochondrial membrane potential, all of which were repressed by pre-irradiational administration with VC-IP. Expression of p53 gene, another hallmark of UV-induced DNA damages, was promoted by UVA irradiation to the keratinocytes but also repressed by VC-IP. Administration with VC-IP of 10-50 microM to human fibroblasts NHDF achieved the enhancement of collagen synthesis, repression of matrix metalloprotease-2/9 activity, and increasing of intracellular Asc contents more markedly than that with Asc itself of the same concentrations. Thus UVA-induced diverse harmful effects could be prevented by VC-IP, which was suggested to ensue intrinsically from the persistent enrichment of intracellular Asc, through esterolytic conversion of VC-IP to a free-form Asc molecule, resulting in relief to UVA-caused oxidative stress.",

Proline is oxidized to glutamate in the mitochondria, with the rate-limiting step catalyzed by proline dehydrogenase (PRODH). PRODH expression is inducible by p53, leading to increased proline oxidation, reactive oxygen species formation, and induction of apoptosis. Paradoxical to its role in apoptosis, proline also protects cells against oxidative stress. Here we explore the mechanism of proline protection against hydrogen peroxide stress in melanoma WM35 cells. Treatment of WM35 cells with proline significantly increased cell viability, diminished oxidative damage of cellular lipids and proteins, and maintained ATP and NADPH levels after exposure to hydrogen peroxide. Inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of PRODH abolished proline protection against oxidative stress, whereas knockdown of Δ(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase, a key enzyme in proline biosynthesis, had no impact on proline protection. Potential linkages between proline metabolism and signaling pathways were explored. The combined inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 eliminated proline protection. A significant increase in Akt activation was observed in proline-treated cells after hydrogen peroxide stress along with a corresponding increase in the phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor class O3a (FoxO3a). The role of PRODH in proline-mediated protection was validated in the prostate carcinoma cell line PC3. Knockdown of PRODH in PC3 cells attenuated phosphorylated levels of Akt and FoxO3a and decreased cell survival during hydrogen peroxide stress. The results provide evidence that PRODH is essential in proline protection against hydrogen peroxide-mediated cell death and that proline/PRODH helps activate Akt in cancer cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"One undisputed milestone of traditional oncology is neoplastic progression, which consists of a progressive selection of dedifferentiated cells driven by a chance sequence of genetic mutations. Recently it has been demonstrated that the overexpression of well-defined transcription factors reprograms somatic cells to the pluripotent stem status. The demonstration raises crucial questions as to whether and to what extent this reprogramming contributes to tumorigenesis, and whether the epigenetic changes involved in it are reversible. Here, we show for the first time that a tumor produced in vivo by a chemical carcinogen is the product of the interaction between neoplastic progression and reprogramming. The experimental model employed the prototype of ascites tumors, the Yoshida AH130 hepatoma and other neoplasias, including human melanoma. AH130 hepatoma was started in the liver by the carcinogen o-aminoazotoluene. This compound binds to and abolishes the p53 protein, producing a genomic instability that promotes both the neoplastic progression and the hepatoma reprogramming. Eventually this tumor contained 100% CD133(+) elements and pO(2)-dependent percentages of the three embryonic transcription factors Nanog, Klf4 and c-Myc. Once transferred into aerobic cultures, the minor cellular fraction expressing this triad generates various types of adherent cells, which are progressively substituted by non-tumorigenic elements committed to fibromuscular, neuronal and glial differentiation. This reprogramming appears to be accomplished stepwise, with the assembly of the triad into a sophisticated transcriptional, oxygen-dependent circuitry, in which Nanog and Klf4 antagonistically regulate c-Myc, and hence, cell hypoxia survival and cell cycle activation.",

We report that both TF and TR could exert inhibition of A431 (human epidermoid carcinoma) and A375 (human malignant melanoma) cell proliferation without adversely affecting normal human epidermal keratinocyte cells. Growth inhibition of A375 cells occurred through apoptosis, as evident from cell cycle arrest at G(0)/G(1) phase, increase in early apoptotic cells, externalization of phosphatidylserine and DNA fragmentation. In our pursuit to dissect the molecular mechanism of TF- and TR-induced apoptosis in A375 cells, we investigated whether cell death is being mediated by mitochondria. In our system, Bax translocation to mitochondria persuaded depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release in cytosol and induced activation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Our intricate investigations on apoptosis also explained that TF and TR augmented Bax:Bcl2 ratio, up-regulated the expression of p53 as well as p21 and inhibited phosphorylation of the cell survival protein Akt. Furthermore, TF and TR elicited intracellular reactive oxygen species generation in A375 cells. These observations raise speculations that TF as well as TR might exert chemopreventive effect through cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptogenic signals via mitochondrial death cascade in human skin cancer cells.",

Here, transcriptional regulation of SPRY1, SPRY2, SPRY3, SPRY4, SPRED1, SPRED2, and SPRED3 genes by WNT/beta-catenin signaling cascade was investigated by using bioinformatics and human intelligence (humint). Because double TCF/LEF-binding sites were identified within the 5'-promoter region of human SPRY4 gene, comparative genomics analyses on SPRY4 orthologs were further performed. SPRY4-FGF1 locus at human chromosome 5q31.3 and FGF2-NUDT6-SPATA5-SPRY1 locus at human chromosome 4q27-q28.1 were paralogous regions within the human genome. Chimpanzee SPRY4 gene was identified within NW_107083.1 genome sequence. Human, chimpanzee, rat and mouse SPRY4 orthologs, consisting of three exons, were well conserved. SPRY4 gene was identified as the evolutionarily conserved target of WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway based on the conservation of double TCF/LEF-binding sites within 5'-promoter region of mammalian SPRY4 orthologs. Human SPRY4 mRNA was expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells, brain, pancreatic islet, colon cancer, head and neck tumor, melanoma, and pancreatic cancer. WNT signaling activation in progenitor cells leads to the growth regulation of progenitor cells themselves through SPRY4 induction, and also to the growth stimulation of proliferating cells through FGF secretion.

Daily guttural pouch irrigations with a clotrimazole emulsion (20 g Canesten(®) Gyn(4) solved in 500 ml water), led to a good recovery of the mucosa above the nerve. Periodic endoscopic examination of the left guttural pouch showed that local thickening and distal atrophy of this pharyngeal ramus did not improve, neither did the clinical symptoms.

Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is not only a potent carcinogen because of its mutagenic effects but also because of its capacity to paralyze natural protection mechanisms, including the tumor suppressor gene p53. Therefore, we studied the effect of UV exposure on the expression of TRAIL in the skin by immunohistochemical analysis. TRAIL and its receptors TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R4 were constitutively expressed in normal epidermis and not altered in a variety of inflammatory dermatoses including those associated with interface dermatitis. TRAIL was not altered in biopsies of acute sunburn, polymorphic light eruption, and photoprovocation testing, indicating that acute UV exposure does not affect TRAIL expression. No differences were observed in UV-protected and chronically UV-exposed skin samples of younger adults. In contrast, TRAIL was significantly reduced in chronically UV-exposed skin of elderly individuals. In addition, TRAIL expression was reduced in actinic keratoses and Bowen disease and almost completely lost in basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas. In contrast, keratoacanthomas did not reveal any alterations in TRAIL expression. Taken together, these data indicate that chronic UV exposure in elderly patients results in the loss of TRAIL expression, which might contribute to the increased risk of skin cancer in this population.

For this reason, we devised the present study on Nup88 expression at the mRNA level. RNA was extracted from fresh tumor tissue corresponding to 122 breast cancer patients. Nup88 mRNA expression was measured by means of differential RT-PCR, standardizing against a constitutive internal control gene (beta-actin). The results were dichotomized into \"high\" and \"low\" expression levels, using the median value as cut-off. High Nup88 mRNA expression levels correlated significantly with ductal and tubular histology (p = 0.012), histologic and nuclear grade 3 of tumors (p < 0.001), absence of hormone receptor expression (p < 0.001), expression of the c-erb-B2 oncogene (p < 0.001), expression of mutant p53 protein (p < 0.001), high proliferation (defined by Ki67 labeling index >20%, p < 0.001), DNA aneuploidy (p < 0.001) as well as the most important ominous clinical prognostic factor, axillary node invasion (p < 0.001).

        "Doc_abstract":"The emergence of drug resistant tumours that are able to escape cell death pose a major problem in the treatment of cancers. Tumours develop resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents by acquiring the ability to repair their DNA. Combination therapies that induce DNA damage and disrupt the DNA damage repair process may therefore prove to be more effective against such tumours. The developmentally important transcription factor TBX2 has been suggested as a novel anticancer drug target, as it is overexpressed in several cancers and possesses strong anti-senescence and pro-proliferative functions. Importantly, we recently showed that when TBX2 is silenced, we are able to reverse several features of transformation in both breast cancer and melanoma cells. Overexpression of TBX2 has also been linked to drug resistance and we have shown that its ectopic expression results in genetically unstable polyploidy cells with resistance to cisplatin. Whether the overexpression of endogenous TBX2 levels is associated with cisplatin resistance in TBX2-driven cancers has, however, not been shown. To address this we have silenced TBX2 in a cisplatin-resistant breast cancer cell line and we show that knocking down TBX2 sensitises the cells to cisplatin by disrupting the ATM-CHK2-p53 signalling pathway. Cell cycle analyses demonstrate that when TBX2 is knocked down there is an abrogation of an S-phase arrest but a robust G2/M arrest that correlates with a reduction in phosphorylated CHK2 and p53 levels. This prevents DNA repair resulting in TBX2-deficient cells entering mitosis with damaged DNA and consequently undergoing mitotic catastrophe. These results suggest that targeting TBX2 in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin could improve the efficacy of current anticancer treatments. ",

It has been suggested that UV radiations might induce mutations in ras oncogenes and p53 tumour-suppressor gene, responsible for skin cancers. With PCR and oligoprobe hybridization, we investigated c-Ha-ras gene mutations at codons 12 and 61 in 120 cutaneous lesions from grafted patients, since they could represent a marker of the evolution of benign skin lesions towards malignancy in this population; 29 similar skin biopsies from non-immunosuppressed patients were also analyzed. In transplant recipients, we detected mutations at codon 12 only in 1/42 non-melanoma skin cancers and 2/29 pre-cancerous keratoses. No mutation was detected in 11 cases of cutaneous Bowen's disease from grafted patients and in pre-malignant and malignant skin samples from control patients. Benign warts exhibited an overall incidence of 18% and 15% of mutations at codon 12 of c-Ha-ras gene in grafted and control patients respectively. We detected only one mutation at codon 61 in a plantar wart. Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are thought to be involved in the malignant evolution of cutaneous disorders in transplant recipients and cooperate with a ras oncogene to induce malignancy in vitro. The presence of HPV DNA in our series of skin samples from grafted patients showed no correlation with the occurrence of c-Ha-ras mutations. Our findings indicate that c-Ha-ras-gene activation by mutations is rare in cutaneous lesions from transplant recipients, and is unlikely to play a crucial role in transformation towards malignancy in skin carcinogenesis among grafted patients.",

To overcome this toxicity, we modified the original compound by covalently attaching a nitric oxide (NO) group. We compared the efficacy of the parental and NO-modified drugs in vitro and in vivo. The novel compound saquinavir-NO (Saq-NO) significantly reduced the viability of a wide spectrum of human and rodent tumor cell lines at significantly lower concentration than the unmodified drug. In contrast to Saq, Saq-NO had no effect on the viability of primary cells and drastically reduced B16 melanoma growth in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. In addition, at the equivalent of the 100% lethal dose of Saq, Saq-NO treatment caused no apparent signs of toxicity. Saq-NO blocked the proliferation of C6 and B16 cells, up-regulated p53 expression, and promoted the differentiation of these two cell types into oligodendrocytes or Schwann-like cells, respectively. Although it has been well documented that Saq decreases tumor cell viability by inhibiting Akt, the anticancer properties of Saq-NO were completely independent of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. Moreover, Saq-NO transiently up-regulated Akt phosphorylation, delivering a protective signal that could be relevant for primary cell protection and the absence of drug toxicity in vivo. It was unlikely that released NO was independently responsible for these drug effects because Saq-NO treatment increased intracellular and secreted NO levels only slightly. Rather, the chemical modification seems to have produced a qualitatively new chemical entity, which may have a unique mode of action against cancer cells.",

The compound possesses anti-cancer activity against a variety of cancer cell lines of different origin.;AECHL-1 treatment for 12 to 48 hr inhibited cell proliferation and induced death in B16F10, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and PC3 cells with minimum growth inhibition in normal HEK 293. The antitumor effect of AECHL-1 was comparable with that of the conventional antitumor drugs paclitaxel and cisplatin. AECHL-1-induced growth inhibition was associated with S/G(2)-M arrests in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and PC3 cells and a G(1) arrest in B16F10 cells. We observed microtubule disruption in MCF-7 cells treated with AECHL-1 in vitro. Compared with control, subcutaneous injection of AECHL-1 to the sites of tumor of mouse melanoma B16F10 implanted in C57BL/6 mice and human breast cancer MCF-7 cells in athymic nude mice resulted in significant decrease in tumor volume. In B16F10 tumors, AECHL-1 at 50 microg/mouse/day dose for 15 days resulted in increased expression of tumor suppressor proteins P53/p21, reduction in the expression of the oncogene c-Myc, and downregulation of cyclin D1 and cdk4. Additionally, AECHL-1 treatment resulted in the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 in B16F10 tumors, which seems to exhibit p53-dependent growth inhibitory responses.;The present data demonstrate the activity of a triterpenoid AECHL-1 which possess a broad spectrum of activity against cancer cells.

A previous phase 1 clinical trial in participants with normal-appearing skin showed that topical POH cream was well tolerated at a dose of 0.76% (w/w). Here, we performed a 3-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2a trial of two different doses of topical POH in individuals with sun-damaged skin. Participants applied POH cream twice daily to each dorsal forearm. Baseline and end-of-study biopsies were taken from each participant to evaluate whether the topical application of POH was effective in reversing actinic damage as evidenced by normalization of quantitative skin histopathologic scores and change in nuclear chromatin pattern as measured by karyometric analysis. There was a borderline reduction in the histopathologic score of the lower-dose POH group compared with the placebo (P = 0.1), but this was not observed in the high-dose group. However, in the high-dose group, a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of nuclei deviating from normal was observed by the use of karyometric analysis (P < 0.01). There was no statistical significance shown in the lower-dose group. No changes were observed in p53 expression, cellular proliferation (by proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression), or apoptosis in either treatment group compared with the placebo group.

Various approaches for using bacteria in cancer therapy include the use of bacteria as sensitizing agents for chemotherapy, as delivery agents for cancer drugs and as agents for gene therapy. The tumor regression stimulated by infecting microorganisms has been attributed to activation of the immune system of the host. However, recent studies indicate that when tumor-harboring mice with defective immune systems are infected with certain microorganisms, the regression of the tumor is still observed, suggesting that there are other host factors contributing to the microbial associated regression of tumors. Since the use of live or attenuated bacteria for tumor regression has associated toxic effects, studies are in progress to identify a pure microbial metabolite or any component of the microbial cell that might have anti-cancer activity. It has now been demonstrated that a redox protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a cupredoxin, can enter into human cancer cells and trigger the apoptotic cell death. In vivo, this cupredoxin can lead to the regression of tumor growth in immunodeficient mice harboring xenografted melanomas and breast cancer tumors without inducing significant toxic effects, suggesting that it has potential anti-cancer activity. This bacterial protein interacts with p53 and modulates mammalian cellular activity. Hence, it could potentially be used as an anti-cancer agent for solid tumors and has translational value in tumor-targeted or in combinational-biochemotherapy strategies for cancer treatments. Here, we focus on diverse approaches to cancer biotherapy, including bacteriolytic and bacterially-derived anti-cancer agents with an emphasis on their mechanism of action and therapeutic potential.",

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) represents 20 % of all non-melanoma skin cancer and is a deadly threat owing to its ability to metastasize to any organ in the body. Therefore, a better understanding of cSCC is essential to strengthen preventative measures and curable treatment options. Currently, research demonstrates that cSCC is diagnosed at a rate of 15-35 per 100,000 people and is expected to increase 2-4 % per year. With respect to metastatic cSCC, this disease is more common in men; people over the age of 75 years; and inhabitants of the south and mid-west USA. In 2010, the American Joint Committee on Cancer updated the Cancer Staging Manual's primary tumor designation to now include high-risk factors; however, factors such as immunosuppression and tumor recurrence were not included. Other staging systems such as Brigham and Women's Hospital have allowed for increased stratification of cSCC. High-risk cSCC is defined as a cSCC that is staged as N0, extends beyond basement membrane, and has high-risk features associated with sub-clinical metastasis. High-risk features are depth of invasion (>2 mm), poor histological differentiation, high-risk anatomic location (face, ear, pre/post auricular, genitalia, hands, and feet), perineural involvement, recurrence, multiple cSCC tumors, and immunosuppression. Epidermal growth factor receptor and nuclear active IκB kinase (IKK) expression are also predictive of metastatic capabilities. Clinically, the initial lesions of a cSCC tumor can present as a painless plaque-like or verrucous tumor that can ultimately progress to being large, necrotic, and infected. Tumors can also present with paresthesias or lymphadenopathy depending on the location involved. With respect to prognosis, metastatic cSCC is lethal, with several large studies demonstrating a mortality rate of >70 %. Therefore, treatment of metastatic cSCC is difficult and depends on the location involved and extent of metastasis. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and any combination of the above. Surgery alone can be used for metastatic cSCC treatment, but is not as effective as surgery in conjunction with radiation therapy. Radiation therapy has some success as a monotherapy in low-risk or cosmetically sensitive areas such as the external ear, eyelid or nose. According to the 2013 National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines, cisplatin as a single agent or combined with 5-fluorouracil hold the strongest support for the treatment of metastatic cSCC; however, the supporting evidence is inconsistent and a curative chemotherapeutic approach is still lacking. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors are a newer class of agents being used in metastatic cSCC and hold some promise as a therapy for this disease. Other areas of interest in finding curative treatments for metastatic cSCC include p53, hypermethylation of specific genes, chromatin remodeling genes, and the RAS/RTK/PI3K pathway. This review addresses the epidemiology, staging, risk factors, clinical presentation, management, and new trends in the treatment of high-risk and metastatic cSCC.",

Upon comparison, SBi132, SBi279, and SBi523 were found to bind in distinct locations and orientations within the hydrophobic target binding pocket of Ca(2+)-S100B with minimal structural changes observed for the protein upon complex formation with each compound. Specifically, SBi132 binds nearby residues in loop 2 (His-42, Phe-43, and Leu-44) and helix 4 (Phe-76, Met-79, Ile-80, Ala-83, Cys-84, Phe-87, and Phe-88), whereas SBi523 interacts with a separate site defined by residues within loop 2 (Ser-41, His-42, Phe-43, Leu-44, Glu-45, and Glu-46) and one residue on helix 4 (Phe-87). The SBi279 binding site on Ca(2+)-S100B overlaps the SBi132 and SBi523 sites and contacts residues in both loop 2 (Ser-41, His-42, Phe-43, Leu-44, and Glu-45) and helix 4 (Ile-80, Ala-83, Cys-84, Phe-87, and Phe-88).

This review summarises the biological and clinical relevance of these proteins in relation to different tumour types.;A literature search was performed using the PubMed database and the reference lists of relevant articles. Single case studies were excluded and only reports with a clinical relevance from 1961 to 2007 were included.;The search yielded over 1000 published articles and reports. Important reports and studies were reviewed, screened and tracked for further relevant publications. Only the most relevant publications are discussed with relation to individual members of the S100 family.;There is increasing evidence that altered expression of S100 family members is seen in many cancers including breast, lung, bladder, kidney, thyroid, gastric, prostate and oral cancers. S100 proteins are commonly up-regulated in tumours and this is often associated with tumour progression. In contrast S100A2, S100A11 and S100A9 have been documented as tumour suppressors in some cancers but as tumour promoters in others. This demonstrates the complexity of the family and variability of their functions. Although the precise roles of these proteins in cancer is still to be discovered many of the family are associated with promoting metastases through interactions with matrix metalloproteinases or by acting as chemoattractants. There is also evidence that some members can regulate transcription factors such as p53.

        "Doc_abstract":"In the development of targeted cancer immunotherapies, the choice of antigen is obviously critical to the design of any therapeutic strategy, but particularly so for tumor vaccines, which must distinguish malignant cells from normal cells. Investigations a decade ago focused on mutated tumor antigens, or viral tumor antigens, with the belief that these foreign or abnormal proteins would be best recognized by the host immune system. Within the last 10 years, however, several tumor antigens have been identified on the basis of recognition by infiltrating T cells in tumor samples. Studies on melanoma, in particular, have revealed that in addition to some mutated tumor antigens, several aberrantly expressed normal proteins, as well as tissue-specific differentiation factors, are recognized by the host immune system. Similar studies in other solid tumors have revealed that certain oncogenes overexpressed in malignant cells, such as p53 and HER-2/neu, are also recognized by host T cells. Our group has been investigating the HER-2/neu oncogenic protein as a vaccine target in patients with HER-2/neu-overexpressing cancers. However, several issues unique to the design of human clinical trials of cancer vaccines must be addressed when translating preclinical experiments to human clinical trials.

        "Doc_abstract":"The clinical possibilities of interferon (IFN) became apparent with early studies demonstrating that it was capable of inhibiting tumor cells in culture and in vivo using animal models. IFN gained the distinction of being the first recombinant cytokine to be licensed in the USA for the treatment of a malignancy in 1986, with the approval of IFN-α2a (Hoffman-La Roche) and IFN-α2b (Schering-Plough) for the treatment of Hairy Cell Leukemia. In addition to this application, other approved antitumor applications for IFN-α2a are AIDS-related Kaposi's Sarcoma and Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) and other approved antitumor applications for IFN-α2b are Malignant Melanoma, Follicular Lymphoma, and AIDS-related Kapoisi's Sarcoma. In the ensuing years, a considerable number of studies have been conducted to establish the mechanisms of the induction and action of IFN's anti-tumor activity. These include identifying the role of Interferon Regulatory Factor 9 (IRF9) as a key factor in eliciting the antiproliferative effects of IFN-α as well as identifying genes induced by IFN that are involved in recognition of tumor cells. Recent studies also show that IFN-activated human monocytes can be used to achieve >95% eradication of select tumor cells. The signaling pathways by which IFN induces apoptosis can vary. IFN treatment induces the tumor suppressor gene p53, which plays a role in apoptosis for some tumors, but it is not essential for the apoptotic response. IFN-α also activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which is associated with cell survival. Downstream of PI3K is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) which, in conjunction with PI3K, may act in signaling induced by growth factors after IFN treatment. This paper will explore the mechanisms by which IFN acts to elicit its antiproliferative effects and more closely examine the clinical applications for the anti-tumor potential of IFN.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Increased cell proliferation, which is a hallmark of aggressive malignant neoplasms, requires a general increase in protein synthesis and a specific increase in the synthesis of replication-promoting proteins. Transient increase in the general protein synthesis rate, as well as preferential translation of specific mRNAs coding for growth promoting proteins (e.g. cyclin D1), takes place during normal mitogenic response. A number of extensively studied growth signal transduction pathways (Ras, PI3K, MAPK, mTOR-dependent pathways) activate the function and expression of various components of the translational machinery. In abnormal situations, constitutive activation of signal transduction pathways (e.g. oncogenic activation of Ras or Myc) leads to continuous upregulation of key elements of translational machinery. On the other hand, tumor suppressor genes (p53, pRb) downregulate ribosomal and tRNA synthesis, and their inactivation results in uncontrolled production of these translational components. During recent years, a significant effort has been dedicated to determining whether expression of translation factors is increased in human tumors using clinical biopsy specimens. The results of these studies indicate that expression of particular translation initiation factors is not always increased in human neoplasms. The pattern of expression is characteristic for a particular tumor type. For example, eIF-4E is usually increased in bronchioloalveolar carcinomas but not in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. Interestingly, in certain highly proliferative and aggressive neoplasms (e.g. squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, melanoma), the expression of eIF-4E is barely detectable. These findings suggest that mechanisms for increasing general protein synthesis in various neoplasms differ significantly. Finally, the possibility of qualitative alterations in the translational machinery, rather than a simple increase in the activity of its components, is discussed along with the possibility of targeting those qualitative differences for tumor therapy.",

Loes), but has since been found in various plants, including grapes, berries and peanuts. Besides cardioprotective effects, resveratrol exhibits anticancer properties, as suggested by its ability to suppress proliferation of a wide variety of tumor cells, including lymphoid and myeloid cancers; multiple myeloma; cancers of the breast, prostate, stomach, colon, pancreas, and thyroid; melanoma; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; ovarian carcinoma; and cervical carcinoma. The growth-inhibitory effects of resveratrol are mediated through cell-cycle arrest; upregulation of p21Cip1/WAF1, p53 and Bax; down-regulation of survivin, cyclin D1, cyclin E, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and clAPs; and activation of caspases. Resveratrol has been shown to suppress the activation of several transcription factors, including NF-kappaB, AP-1 and Egr-1; to inhibit protein kinases including IkappaBalpha kinase, JNK, MAPK, Akt, PKC, PKD and casein kinase II; and to down-regulate products of genes such as COX-2, 5-LOX, VEGF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, AR and PSA. These activities account for the suppression of angiogenesis by this stilbene. Resveratrol also has been shown to potentiate the apoptotic effects of cytokines (e.g., TRAIL), chemotherapeutic agents and gamma-radiation. Phamacokinetic studies revealed that the target organs of resveratrol are liver and kidney, where it is concentrated after absorption and is mainly converted to a sulfated form and a glucuronide conjugate. In vivo, resveratrol blocks the multistep process of carcinogenesis at various stages: it blocks carcinogen activation by inhibiting aryl hydrocarbon-induced CYP1A1 expression and activity, and suppresses tumor initiation, promotion and progression. Besides chemopreventive effects, resveratrol appears to exhibit therapeutic effects against cancer. Limited data in humans have revealed that resveratrol is pharmacologically quite safe. Currently, structural analogues of resveratrol with improved bioavailability are being pursued as potential therapeutic agents for cancer.",

Clinical investigations have been completed or are under way to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bortezomib alone or in combination with chemotherapy in multiple myeloma, both at relapse and presentation, as well as in other cancer types. The antiproliferative, proapoptotic, antiangiogenic, and antitumor activities of bortezomib result from proteasome inhibition and depend on the altered degradation of a host of regulatory proteins. Exposure to bortezomib has been shown to stabilize p21, p27, and p53, as well as the proapoptotic Bid and Bax proteins, caveolin-1, and inhibitor kappaB-alpha, which prevents activation of nuclear factor kappaB-induced cell survival pathways. Bortezomib also promoted the activation of the proapoptotic c-Jun-NH2 terminal kinase, as well as the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. The anticancer effects of bortezomib as a single agent have been demonstrated in xenograft models of multiple myeloma, adult T-cell leukemia, lung, breast, prostate, pancreatic, head and neck, and colon cancer, and in melanoma. In these preclinical in vivo studies, bortezomib treatment resulted in decreased tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis, as well as increased survival and tumor apoptosis. In several in vitro and/or in vivo cancer models, bortezomib has also been shown to enhance the antitumor properties of several antineoplastic treatments. Importantly, bortezomib was generally well tolerated and did not appear to produce additive toxicities when combined with other therapies in the dosing regimens used in these preclinical in vivo investigations. These findings provide a rationale for further clinical trials using bortezomib alone or in combination regimens with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or novel agents in patients with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors.",

Identification of prognostic factors related to tumor biology might improve this assessment. We investigated the prognostic significance of the melanoma cell adhesion molecule (M-CAM) in EOC. Using the same antibody, M-CAM expression was tested by Western blotting in protein extracts and by immunohistochemestry in tissue microarrays generated from 133 consecutively resected, well characterized EOC samples. Fisher test, Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards analysis were used to relate M-CAM expression to clinico-pathological variables and to time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS). In vitro biochemical analysis showed a progressively increased M-CAM expression from normal to malignant cells. M-CAM protein, detected immunohistochemically, was significantly associated with advanced tumor stage, serous and undifferentiated histotype, extent of residual disease and p53 accumulation. Presence or absence of M-CAM significantly divided patients according to their TTP (median, 22 vs. 79 months, respectively; log-rank p = 0.001) and OS (median, 42 vs. 131 months, respectively; log-rank p = 0.0003). In the subgroup of advanced stage patients who achieved complete response after front-line treatment, M-CAM expression and absence of residual disease were significantly associated with shorter TTP (p = 0.003, HR 5.25, 95% Cl 1.79-15.41 and p = 0.011, HR 3.77, 95% Cl 1.36-10.49 respectively) at the multivariate level. In the same sub-group of patients, M-CAM expression remained the only parameter significantly associated with OS (p = 0.005, HR 3.35, 95% Cl 1.42-6.88). M-CAM is a marker of early relapse and poorer outcome in EOC. In particular, M-CAM expression identifies a subgroup of front-line therapy-responding patients who undergo dramatic relapses, thus helping to better select patients who might benefit from new/alternative therapeutic modalities.",

        "Doc_abstract":"As dermatologists, we have all been active in educating patients about sun awareness and sun protection. This is even more important for children, as childhood exposure to ultraviolet light is a significant risk for both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers. The importance of an educational approach in appropriate sun awareness in childhood is further underscored by the recent findings by Rivers et al., in the Vancouver Moles Cohort study, presented at the 1999 American Academy of Dermatology meeting. In a placebo-controlled trial, the findings of Rivers et al. clearly demonstrated that the use of sunscreens can significantly decrease the formation of nevae in children, providing further evidence to support sun awareness education initiatives. The lead article by Gooderham and Guenther in the Basic and Clinical Sciences section evaluates the effectiveness of a particular sun awareness program, and gives valuable insights into how more effective approaches may be used in the future. In addition to ultraviolet light playing a causal role in cutaneous malignancies, it is known to induce a number of other skin problems. One particularly difficult group of disorders is the photosensitive dermatoses, including solar urticaria. Bissonnette et al. describe an innovative approach to the management of refractory solar urticaria with plasma exchange. In the Grand Rounds section, Strauss et al. review the case of an acute SLE and give an insightful discussion related to bullous eruptions in acutely ill children. The mechanism of ultraviolet-light-induced carcinogenesis involves UV-induced DNA damage. Over the past decade, it has become clear that tumour suppressor genes can regulate these processes. In the Review section, Tron et al. discuss the role of the suppressor gene p53, which is mutated or lost in nonmelanoma skin cancer. P53 is crucial in protecting keratinocytes from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation, and in their instructive article, these authors use gene-targeted mutant mice lacking p53 to further evaluate the role in UV-induced DNA damage. With the warm weather upon us, we are spending more time in the outdoors and, as a result, are exposed to a vast number of environmental onslaughts. These include such things as Rickettsial disease, summarized in our CME section Summary Notes. Furthermore, in a comprehensive review, Dr. Sasseville examines another outdoor threat as he delineates the wide spectrum of plant contact dermatitis. This represents an important and in-depth reference on phytodermatitis. Our specialty, and indeed all of medicine, is being dramatically altered by recent advances in our understanding of disease at a molecular level. This new understanding of disease has led to the potential of modifying gene expression through the use of gene therapy. This is particularly attractive in skin disease, where gene therapy can be delivered quite readily through the skin. This advancement is insightfully discussed in the article by Somani et al., \"Gene Therapy and Dermatology,\" which is both valuable for the cognoscenti and noncognoscenti alike, and serves as an important reference work in this area.",

These lncRNAs are found to be dysregulated in a variety of cancers. BRAF activated non-coding RNA (BANCR) is a 693-bp transcript on chromosome 9 with a potential functional role in melanoma cell migration. The clinical significance of BANCR, and its' molecular mechanisms controlling cancer cell migration and metastasis are unclear.;Expression of BANCR was analyzed in 113 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and seven NSCLC cell lines using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. Gain and loss of function approaches were used to investigate the biological role of BANCR in NSCLC cells. The effects of BANCR on cell viability were evaluated by MTT and colony formation assays. Apoptosis was evaluated by Hoechst staining and flow cytometry. Nude mice were used to examine the effects of BANCR on tumor cell metastasis in vivo. Protein levels of BANCR targets were determined by western blotting and fluorescent immunohistochemistry.;BANCR expression was significantly decreased in 113 NSCLC tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. Additionally, reduced BANCR expression was associated with larger tumor size, advanced pathological stage, metastasis distance, and shorter overall survival of NSCLC patients. Reduced BANCR expression was found to be an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC. Histone deacetylation was involved in the downregulation of BANCR in NSCLC cells. Ectopic expression of BANCR impaired cell viability and invasion, leading to the inhibition of metastasis in vitro and in vivo. However, knockdown of BANCR expression promoted cell migration and invasion in vitro. Overexpression of BANCR was found to play a key role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the regulation of E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin expression.;We determined that BANCR actively functions as a regulator of EMT during NSCLC metastasis, suggesting that BANCR could be a biomarker for poor prognosis of NSCLC.",

However, true esophageal Paget disease (intraepithelial growth of neoplastic cells with glandular differentiation) has only rarely been reported. We encountered 3 endoscopic biopsy specimens containing Paget cells in squamous epithelium associated with adenocarcinomas in Barrett esophagus (BE) and in the esophagogastric junction. To determine the prevalence of Paget cells in the esophagus, we studied 81 endoscopic mucosal resections and 27 esophagectomies from patients with invasive or intramucosal adenocarcinoma, and compared the findings to a control group of 47 endoscopic mucosal resections and 25 esophagectomies from patients with high-grade dysplasia in BE. Paget cells were present in squamous epithelium overlying 5 (4.9%) of 108 adenocarcinomas but in none (0%) of 72 BE with high-grade dysplasia (P=0.16). A computerized search for primary Paget disease using the terms \"Paget's and esophagus\" or \"pagetoid and esophagus\" from 1994 to 2007 did not yield any additional cases. Among the 8 patients with Paget cells (including the 2 index biopsies) there were no differences in either sex distribution (7M:1F) or age (mean 62.4 y) as compared with 103 adenocarcinomas without Paget cells (93M:10F, P=0.58; mean age 69.2 y, P=0.78). Morphologically, all adenocarcinomas with Paget cells contained at least a component of diffuse, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and 1 was a signet ring cell carcinoma. Paget cells involved only squamous epithelium directly above the poorly differentiated tumor foci. Histochemistry for periodic acid-Schiff with diastase (PAS-D) and mucicarmine, and immunohistochemistry for CK7, CK20, p53, and E-cadherin, were performed on 7 Paget cases with the following results: PAS-D+ (7 of 7, 100%), mucicarmine+ (6 of 7, 86%), CK7+ (7 of 7, 100%), CK20+ (5 of 7, 71%), p53 overexpression (3 of 7, 43%), and E-cadherin loss (complete loss in 1 and faint expression in 3, 57%). Overall, PAS-D was the most efficacious stain for highlighting Paget cells. A control group of 19 adenocarcinomas without Paget cells were also stained for E-cadherin; only 1 showed faint expression (5%) and none showed complete loss (P=0.01). These results demonstrate a low but significant prevalence (4.9%) of Paget cells in esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinomas. Unlike previously described cases of mammary, vulvar, and perianal Paget disease, esophageal Paget cells are almost universally associated with underlying adenocarcinoma and not with high grade dysplasia (\"in situ\" disease) or primary Paget disease. A commonality among cases with Paget cells is the presence of focal or diffuse, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with discohesive cells. E-cadherin alterations seem to play a less significant role.",

Yet, molecular mechanisms are still insufficiently understood. Besides ultraviolet (UV)-indicative mutations, chromosomal aberrations are prominent. As telomeres are essential in preserving chromosome integrity, and telomere erosion as well as aberrant spatial telomere distribution contribute to genomic instability, we first established telomere length profiles across the whole tissue and identified normal skin (10/30) harboring discrete epidermal sites (stem cell territories) of evenly short telomeres. Precancerous actinic keratoses (AKs) (17) and SCCs (27) expressed two telomere phenotypes: (i) tissue-wide evenly short to intermediate and (ii) longer and tissue-wide heterogeneous telomere lengths, suggesting two modes of initiation, with one likely to originate in the epidermal stem cells. Although tumor histotype, location, patient gender or age failed to distinguish the two SCC telomere phenotypes, as did telomerase activity, we found a trend for a higher degree of aberrant p53 and cyclin D1 expression with long/heterogeneous telomeres. In addition, we established an association for the short/homogeneous telomeres with a simpler and the heterogeneous telomeres with a more complex karyotype correlating also with distinct chromosomal changes. SCCs (13) from renal transplant recipients displayed the same telomere dichotomy, suggesting that both telomere subtypes contribute to 'carcinomatous catastrophy' under immunosuppression by selecting for a common set (3, 9p and 17q) and subtype-specific aberrations (e.g., 6p gain, 13q loss). As a second mechanism of telomere-dependent genomic instability, we investigated changes in telomere distribution with its most severe form of telomeric aggregates (TAs). We identified a telomere length-independent but progression-dependent increase in cells with small telomere associations in AKs (17/17) and additional TAs in SCCs (24/32), basal cell carcinomas (30/31) and malignant melanomas (15/15), and provide evidence for a reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism in this UV-induced telomere organization-dependent genomic instability.

Two major forms of XP are known with different biochemical defects: one form lacks nucleotide excision repair (NER); the other lacks the capacity to replicate damaged DNA. Since the clinical symptoms of both kinds of patients are almost the same, the different cellular defects must be reconciled with common clinical outcomes. An additional question among the NER defective patients is how to reconcile widely different skin and central nervous system symptoms with mutations in the same biochemical pathway. XP involves seven genes of the NER system (XPA through G). The XPA gene codes for a protein that is central to NER and binds to a variety of UV light and chemical damage to DNA. It also acts as a nucleation center for other repair proteins to attach and carry out excision and replacement synthesis. Mutations in XPA that are within the DNA binding site produce more severe CNS disorders, than mutations in the C-terminal region of the protein that interacts with the TFIIH complex. In contrast, mutations in two members of the TFIIH complex, the XPB and XPD genes are generally very severe with both skin and CNS disorders. Missense mutations within the helicase regions of these genes are associated with DNA repair deficiencies and XPD; mutations elsewhere in these genes are correlated with symptoms of XP and Cockayne syndrome and trichothiodystrophy. This raises the question whether the CNS disorders of XPA, XPB, and XPD patients are similar, or whether a careful clinical evaluation might reveal different mechanisms of development. The XP variant lacks the capacity to replicate damaged DNA due to mutations in hRad30, a damage-specific polymerase eta. The phenotype of XP variant cells becomes unstable and the cells become much more UV-sensitive when they are transformed by methods that inactivate p53. On a p53 negative background, the induction of recombination between sister chromatids occurs much more extensively than in normal cells, and we have evidence that DNA double strand breaks which trigger an apoptotic pathway involving caspase-3 are involved. The pathway for UV carcinogenesis may be the same for all XP patients if the ultimate cause of genomic instability is an increase in replication of damaged DNA by the error-prone polymerase zeta. The presence of unrepaired damage in the NER defective groups of XP would present more substrate for the error-prone system leading to increased mutation rates. The absence of pol eta would require cells to use the error-prone pol zeta pathway, also increasing mutation rates from UV damage. A common pathway for increased mutagenesis therefore underlies both forms of XP.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The role of the E6 oncoprotein from high-risk members of the α human papillomavirus genus in anogenital cancer has been well established. However, far less is known about the E6 protein from the β human papillomavirus genus (β-HPVs). Some β-HPVs potentially play a role in non-melanoma skin cancer development, although they are not required for tumor maintenance. Instead, they may act as a co-factor that enhances the carcinogenic potential of UV damage. Indeed, the E6 protein from certain β-HPVs (HPV 5 and 8) promotes the degradation of p300, a histone acetyl transferase involved in UV damage repair. Here, we show that the expression of HPV 5 and 8 E6 increases thymine dimer persistence as well as the likelihood of a UVB induced double strand break (DSB). Importantly, we provide a mechanism for the increased DNA damage by showing that both extended thymine dimer persistence as well as elevated DSB levels are dependent on the ability of HPV 8 E6 to promote p300 degradation. We further demonstrate that HPV 5 and 8 E6 expression reduces the mRNA and protein levels of ATR, a PI3 kinase family member that plays a key role in UV damage signaling, but that these levels remain unperturbed in cells expressing a mutated HPV 8 E6 incapable of promoting p300 degradation. We confirm that the degradation of p300 leads to a reduction in ATR protein levels, by showing that ATR levels rebound when a p300 mutant resistant to HPV 8 mediated degradation and HPV 8 E6 are co-transfected. Conversely, we show that ATR protein levels are reduced when p300 is targeted for degradation by siRNA. Moreover, we show the reduced ATR levels in HPV 5 and 8 E6 expressing cells results in delayed ATR activation and an attenuated ability of cells to phosphorylate, and as a result accumulate, p53 in response to UVB exposure, leading to significantly reduced cell cycle arrest. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that β-HPV E6 expression can enhance the carcinogenic potential of UVB exposure by promoting p300 degradation, resulting in a reduction in ATR levels, which leads to increased thymine dimer persistence and increased UVB induced DSBs.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Protection against sun-induced damage leading to photocarcinogenesis in skin is a highly desirable goal. Among various strategies, chemopreventive approaches utilizing non-toxic agents to prevent the occurrence of precancerous lesions or their surrogate markers are potentially attractive. Epidemiological and experimental studies provide evidence that some naturally occurring chemical agents in the human diet can diminish cancer risk. Aside from water, tea is the most common beverage consumed worldwide. Black tea accounts for nearly 80% of total tea production. Black tea and green tea are derived from the same plant, Camelia sinensis. Green tea contains monomeric polyphenols known as flavanols and black tea contains dimeric flavanols and polymeric polyphenols known as theaflavins (TFs) and thearubigins (TRs). Over the past fifteen years our laboratory has been exploring the feasibility of using tea and its constitutents as an approach to skin cancer prevention. We demonstrated that green tea, black tea and constituent polyphenols protect against chemical- and ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced carcinogenesis and reduce the growth of established tumors in skin. We have also shown the efficacy of green and black tea extracts against UVB and psoralen + ultraviolet A (PUVA)-induced early damage in skin. Although PUVA is highly effective in treating certain skin diseases, careful follow-up studies of cohorts of patients have shown that similar to UVB, PUVA treatment increases the risk for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. We have found that oral administration of a standardized green tea extract (SGTE) prior to and during treatment of SKH-1 mice diminished PUVA-induced skin hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis. SGTE-treatment also inhibited PUVA-induced accumulation of c-fos and p53 proteins and epithelial hyperproliferation. Both topical application and oral administration of SGTE after PUVA-treatment reduced skin inflammation and cell hyperproliferation. Topical application of SGTE to human skin prior to PUVA-treatment inhibited the delayed skin inflammatory response. Similarly, oral and topical administration of standardized black tea extract (SBTE) and its two major polyphenolic sub-fractions protect against UVB-induced erythema in SKH-1 mice. Furthermore, topical application of tea extracts to human volunteers protects against UVB-induced erythema. In summary, these studies indicate that tea extracts are effective in reducing UVB- and PUVA-mediated DNA damage, expression of early response genes and early inflammatory changes in skin. These studies verify a conceptual rationale for employing naturally occurring dietary constitutents as an approach to cancer chemoprevention.",

Preclinical studies demonstrated activity in cisplatin-resistant tumours and tumours with mutated p53 status. Phase I & II clinical studies gave preliminary indications of activity in melanoma, pancreatic, lung and ovarian cancers. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and confirm the toxicity of BBR3464 when given either as first- or second-line treatment for advanced disease in patients with gastric and gastro-oesphageal adenocarcinoma. Two multicentre, open label, Gehan design studies were conducted; one study used BBR3464 as first-line and the other as second-line treatment for metastatic or locally advanced disease. Nineteen first-line and 26 second-line patients were enrolled receiving a total of 74 and 53 infusions, respectively. Initially, seven patients in the second-line study received BBR3464 using the planned schedule of 1.1 mg/m2 every 4 weeks; however, 5 of these patients experienced dose-limiting grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia; subsequent patients in both studies were treated using the modified schedule of 0.9 mg/m2, every 21 days. In 1 of 17 evaluable, previously untreated patients, regression of multiple skin lesions was noted with stabilisation of lung metastases and maxillary sinus mass, lasting 155 days. In the first-line study, the median time to progression was 85 days [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 42, 127] (2.8 months) and in the second-line study, the median time to progression was 71 days [95% CI: 42, 109] and 38 days [95% CI: 32, 73] in the 1.1 and 0.9 mg/m2 dose level groups, respectively. Toxicity data were available for 45 patients. Neutropenia was the main toxicity seen (G3: 40%, G4: 40%). Febrile neutropenia was observed in six patients (15%) treated with 0.9 mg/m2 compared with five patients (71%) treated with 1.1 mg/m2 BBR3464. Other drug-related toxicities (G3/4) included: anaemia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mucositis and fatigue. Diarrhoea and nausea/ vomiting were adequately controlled by the use of loperamide and antiemetics, respectively. Recruitment to the second-line study was closed early due to the poor response rate (1/17 evaluable, 6%; 95% CI: 1%, 27%) and short time to progression noted in the first-line study.

The mass-like clinical presentation and histologic features result in frequent misclassification, resulting in inappropriate clinical management. There are only a few reported cases in the English literature. Twenty-one patients with parotid gland solitary fibrous tumor were compiled from the English literature (Medline 1960-2011) and integrated with this case report. The patients included 11 males and 11 females, aged 11-79 years (mean, 51.2 years), who presented with a parotid gland painless mass gradually increasing in size or with compression symptoms, with a mean duration of symptoms of 24.7 months. The mean tumor size was 4.5 cm. Grossly, all tumors were described as well-circumscribed to encapsulated, firm, homogenous white to tan masses. Seven patients had a preoperative fine needle aspiration performed, with the majority interpreted to represent pleomorphic adenoma or cementifying fibroma. Histologically, the tumors were well circumscribed, although many tumors showed focally entrapped normal salivary gland acini and ducts at the edge. The tumors were cellular, arranged in haphazard short interlacing fascicles of spindled to epithelioid cells. The spindled cells showed tapering cytoplasm with monotonous, round to oval nuclei with coarse nuclear chromatin distribution. Keloid-like to wiry collagen was present between the neoplastic cells. Mitoses were identified in most cases, while necrosis was absent. Isolated, patulous vessels were present, but a well developed \"hemangiopericytoma-like\" vascular pattern was not seen. Three tumors were classified as malignant, showing marked nuclear pleomorphism and increased mitoses. When immunohistochemistry was performed, all tumors showed strong and diffuse vimentin, with a majority showing CD34, bcl-2 and CD99 immunoreactivity; all cases tested were negative for S100 protein, cytokeratin, EMA, CAM5.2, smooth muscle actin, muscle specific actin, desmin, MYOD1, myogenin, CD117, GFAP, CD31, FVIII-RAg, collagen IV, p63, p53, calponin, caldesmon, CD56, NFP, and ALK-1. The principle differential diagnoses include pleomorphic adenoma, myoepithelioma, nodular fasciitis, schwannoma, fibromatosis coli, spindle cell \"sarcomatoid\" carcinoma, and spindle cell melanoma. All patients were managed with surgery, while two patients also received radiation therapy. Metastatic disease was identified in one patient immediately after excision. All patients with follow-up were alive without evidence of disease (n = 18), but the average follow-up is only 1.9 years. One patient is alive with disease at 12 months. Parotid gland SFT is a rare tumor, usually presenting in middle aged adults as a slowly growing mass. Characteristic histologic appearance with CD34 and bcl-2 immunoreactivity support the diagnosis. Surgery is the treatment of choice to yield a good outcome.",

The general structure of the MICA molecule resembles that of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. MIC molecules are considered to be stress-induced antigens that are recognized by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells, which play an important role in the surveillance of transformed infected and damaged cells. Associations of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules with skin cancer have been described before. To evaluate the possible association of MICA gene polymorphism with the risk for nonmelanoma skin cancer we evaluated 153 cases with squamous cell carcinoma, 261 cases with basal cell carcinoma, 111 controls with malignant melanoma, and 247 controls without a history of skin cancer. Five distinct MICA alleles A4, A5, A6, A9, and A5.1 were studied. As the MICA 5.1 variant gene contains a four-nucleotide insertion that causes a stop codon in the trans membrane region, the resulting truncated MICA molecule does not reside on the cellular membrane. In the case of individuals who are homozygous for MICA 5.1 this results in cells that are naked for the MICA molecule. We therefore specifically addressed the possible association between MICA 5.1 homozygosity and skin cancer, as these individuals are expected to be at the highest risk for skin cancer if the MICA gene plays a role in skin carcinogenesis. Viral proteins may serve as antigens for recognition of skin cancer by the immune system. Human papillomavirus is the most likely candidate virus to be involved in the carcinogenesis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Hence, we also assessed the association between MICA polymorphism and squamous cell carcinoma in human-papillomavirus-positive and human-papillomavirus-negative individuals as identified by the presence of human papillomavirus DNA in hairs plucked from their eyebrows. Our analyses did not reveal any significant differences regarding the MICA allele frequencies between cases and controls. Also homozygotes and heterozygotes for the MICA 5.1 variant gene were not at an increased risk for skin cancer compared to individuals without this variant gene and infection with human papillomavirus did not materially influence these findings. The same group of cases and controls was large enough to show an association between melanocortin 1 receptor gene polymorphism and skin cancer and to reasonably exclude an association between p53 codon 72 polymorphism and skin cancer. Therefore, we conclude that an association between MICA gene polymorphism and nonmelanoma skin cancer is not likely.",

We describe the histopathologic features, immunohistochemistry, and human papillomavirus (HPV) status of 29 patients with scrotal SCC. The mean age at presentation was 55 years (range, 30 to 74 y). White to black ratio was 1.9:1. There was no predominant occupation, with the majority being white-collar professionals. Clinical history of condylomas was present in 5 patients, and 7 patients had a history of multiple skin cancers including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and other SCCs. Other comorbidities included human immunodeficiency virus infection (n=2), kidney transplant (n=1), leukemia/lymphoma (n=2), hidradenitis suppurativa (n=1), chronic scrotal infections with abscess (n=1), inflamed epidermal inclusion cyst (n=1), and lichen planus (n=1). One patient had a history of regular tanning bed use. Morphologically, the majority was usual type (n=17), followed by basaloid (n=7) and warty (n=5). Nineteen cases were in situ, and 10 were invasive. Three patients had inguinal lymphadenopathy; in 1, metastasis was confirmed. Suprabasal nuclear staining for Ki67 was considered positive. For p16, a continuous band of nuclear and cytoplasmic staining was considered positive, and a noncontinuous or absence of staining was considered negative. p16 was positive in 10 cases; high-risk HPV was confirmed in 7 cases. Ki67 was positive in 8/17 (47%) usual, 6/7 (85.7%) basaloid, and 3/5 (60%) warty type. p53 was positive in 5/17 (29.4%) usual, 2/7 (28.6%) basaloid, and 1/5 (20%) warty type. All patients were treated with local excision only; 13 had positive margins. Three patients were treated with imiquimod after local excision. The median follow-up was 30 months. Three patients recurred and were treated with re-excision; 1 patient received radiotherapy. Overall, the morphologic, immunohistochemical, and HPV studies show that, similar to SCC of the vulva or penis, the SCC of the scrotum can be divided into 2 major groups. Group 1 (38.5%): positive for p16 and elevated Ki67. This group is associated with HPV infection and displays predominantly a basaloid or warty morphology, although a number of them are of usual type. Group 2 (61.5%): negative for p16. This group has variable Ki67 expression, is consistently negative for HPV, and displays predominantly usual-type morphology. SCC of the scrotum in the United States currently affects primarily white-collar professionals. The majority present with in situ lesions, and the high rate of positive margins at first excision suggests that they are clinically ill-defined lesions. No longer are occupational exposures to carcinogens the major etiology of scrotal SCC. Rather in contemporary times, common risk factors include HPV infection, immunocompromised states, and chronic scrotal inflammatory conditions.",

        "Doc_abstract":"There is often a considerable lapse of time between the definition of what causes a disease in the laboratory and the development of successful therapy. However, the history of medicine teaches us that the need to understand the scientific basis of disease before the discovery of new treatments is both essential and inevitable. During the middle of the 19th century, the work of the great German pathologist, Rudolf Virchow, defined disease as having an anatomic or histologic basis. In the clinic, this scientific perspective would lead to increasingly effective and, often, increasingly aggressive surgical approaches to disease. Later in the 19th century, Koch's discovery of the tubercle bacillus (a discovery Virchow disbelieved and publication of which he thwarted, since he hypothesized that cancer, not microbes, caused consumption!), would define a microbiological basis for disease. With bacteria defined as a major cause of human suffering, the stage was set for the development of the discovery of effective antibiotics. In the early 20th century, the pioneering work of Banting, Best and others would show that disease can also have an endocrine or metabolic basis. This new body of scientific knowledge would lead not only to the specific discovery of insulin as an effective treatment for diabetes but also to a more general understanding of the role of hormones, vitamins and co-factors in human health and disease. Basic medical research and its successful translation into effective treatments has fundamentally altered the cause of human death. In the developed world, where access to the benefit of this work is available, infectious disease is not the problem it was in the days of Pasteur, Metchnikoff and Ehrlich. As we approach the millennium, science is now teaching us that diseases, particularly cancer, can have a molecular or genetic basis. Can successful application of this new knowledge be far behind? We are already seeing the application of this new knowledge in cancer drug screening and cancer drug development. At the NCI, for example, the old in vivo mouse screen using mouse lymphomas has been shelved; it discovered compounds with some activity in lymphomas, but not the common solid tumors of adulthood. It has been replaced with an initial in vitro screen of some sixty cell lines, representing the common solid tumors-ovary, G.I., lung, breast, CNS, melanoma and others. The idea was to not only discover new drugs with specific anti-tumor activity but also to use the small volumes required for in vitro screening as a medium to screen for new natural product compounds, one of the richest sources of effective chemotherapy. The cell line project had an unexpected dividend. The pattern of sensitivity in the panel predicted the mechanism of action of unknown compounds. An antifolate suppressed cell growth of the different lines like other antifolates, anti-tubulin compounds suppressed like other anti-tubulins, and so on. It now became possible, at a very early stage of cancer drug screening, to select for drugs with unknown-and potentially novel-mechanisms of action. The idea was taken to the next logical step, and that was to characterize the entire panel for important molecular properties of human malignancy: mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53, expression of important oncogenes like ras or myc, the gp170 gene which confers multiple drug resistance, protein-specific kinases, and others. It now became possible to use the cell line panel as a tool to detect new drugs which targeted a specific genetic property of the tumor cell. Researchers can now ask whether a given drug is likely to inhibit multiple drug resistance or kill cells which over-express specific oncogenes at the earliest phase of drug discovery. In this issue of The Oncologist, Tom Connors celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of cancer chemotherapy. His focus is on the importance of international collaboration in clinical trials and the negative impact of unnecessary bureaucracy and regulation. As a student of Tom's in the 1970s in London, working on hepatoma-specific alkylating agents at Charing Cross Hospital in collaboration with his lab on the other side of town, I can attest to the fact that the regulatory hurdles to cancer drug development just twenty years later have added immeasurably to the effort and cost of cancer drug development. However, I look with optimism to the future of cancer diagnosis, prevention and treatment. It is a future where what we are learning now about the molecular and genetic basis of cancer will find their clinical outlet just as surely as the anatomic, microbial, metabolic and endocrine basis for disease has in the past. This new knowledge will provide new techniques in molecular diagnosis, which will allow us to predict which in situ cancers are destined for malignant behavior, and which can be safely watched without the need for intervention. Individual patient risk for particular cancers will be accurately predictable, so that patients can alter lifestyle habits or begin other prevention strategies. Oncogenes and growth suppressor genes give us new targets to inhibit or replace. Tumor-specific kinases will meet their inhibitors. The oncologist will play a leading role in understanding, applying and interpreting this new information in the clinic-an exciting and challenging future!"}]
