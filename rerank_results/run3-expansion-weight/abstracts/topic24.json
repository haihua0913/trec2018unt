        "Doc_abstract":"High levels of beta-catenin and activating mutations in the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1) have been demonstrated in malignant melanomas, implicating dysregulated Wnt signalling in the pathogenesis of this malignancy. We systematically examined melanoma cell lines for activating CTNNB1 mutations as well as genetic and epigenetic alterations of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC), another key component of the Wnt signalling transduction pathway. Of 40 cell lines tested, one carried a truncating APC mutation and loss of the corresponding wild-type allele, and one carried a CTNNB1 missense mutation. Hypermethylation of APC promoter 1A was present in five of the cell lines (13%) and in nine of 54 melanoma biopsies (17%). Cells with truncating APC or activating CTNNB1 mutations showed increased transcription from endogenous and ectopic beta-catenin/T-cell factor (Tcf)-responsive target genes, consistent with the known effects of these alterations on beta-catenin stability and Tcf transactivation. In contrast, cell lines with APC promoter 1A hypermethylation did not show increased Wnt signalling, probably due to residual APC activity expressed from promoter 1B. Suppression of APC transcripts in melanoma cells by stable expression of short hairpin RNAs led to a Wnt signalling-independent increase in cell proliferation, but also reduced the invasive growth in collagen type I. Collectively, our data suggest that the tumour-suppressive function of APC in melanocytic cells is dose dependent. We propose that epigenetic silencing of promoter 1A may contribute to the development of malignant melanoma by reducing the expression of APC to a level that promotes cell proliferation without compromising the invasive capacity.",

Recent reports indicate that the APC gene is an intermediary between cell adhesion molecules and the cytoskeleton and that it may function as a gatekeeper of colonic epithelial proliferation. The objective of this study was to analyse APC's presence in lentigos, primary melanomas and melanoma metastases. By immunohistochemistry, APC was demonstrated in all lentigos, in 75 out of 88 primary melanomas and in 16 out of 28 melanoma lymphatic metastases. The percentage of immunolabelled tumour cells (APC index) in lentigos ranged between 5 and 69%, in primary melanomas between 0 and 98% and in melanoma metastases between 0 and 52%. Statistically significant differences between lentigos and primary melanomas and between lentigos and metastases in APC expression were found. In a multivariate analysis, APC showed an independent prognostic impact. Analysis of microsatellite instability in the APC locus was performed on 29 melanomas. Microsatellite instability was found in 5/29 melanomas and loss of heterozygosity in 1/29 melanomas. Promoter methylation of APC was found in 6/10 APC-negative primary melanomas and in 9/10 APC-negative melanoma lymphatic metastases investigated. We conclude about important role of APC alterations for melanoma progression.",

In this study, we have examined the effect of beta-catenin mutation (S37F) or APC loss on the proteasome sensitivity of additional subcellular beta-catenin pools in melanoma cells. In contrast to detergent-soluble beta-catenin, the detergent-insoluble protein remains proteasome-sensitive irrespective of S37F mutation or APC status. This insoluble component appears associated primarily with nuclear cytoskeletal elements. In addition, DNase I treatment solubilized a portion of detergent-insoluble beta-catenin, suggesting that this fraction also contains chromatin-associated protein, and correlating with a proteasome-sensitive elevation in beta-catenin-stimulated reporter activity. Since the detergent-insoluble nuclear component of beta-catenin displays GSK-3beta- and APC-independent proteasome sensitivity, distinct from the soluble nuclear and cytosolic pools of this protein, regulation of beta-catenin proteasome sensitivity and the contribution of this process to beta-catenin function may be more complex than previously appreciated.",

We investigated 37 malignant melanomas (15 primary tumors and 22 metastases) for alterations of 4 genes encoding members of this pathway, i.e., CTNNB1 (beta-catenin gene, 3p22.1), APC (adenomatous polyposis coli gene, 5q22.2), BTRC (beta-transducin repeat-containing protein gene, 10q24.3) and ICAT (inhibitor of beta-catenin and Tcf-4, 1p36.2). Mutational analysis of CTNNB1 identified somatic mutations in 1 primary melanoma and 1 melanoma metastasis from 2 different patients (5%). Both mutations affected the N-terminal degradation box of beta-catenin, which is important for the regulation of beta-catenin homeostasis. Another primary melanoma carried a somatic APC missense mutation within the known mutation cluster region in exon 15. Fourteen tumors (40%) showed LOH at microsatellite markers on 1p36. None of the tumors had lost both copies of the ICAT gene, but 1 melanoma metastasis carried a somatic point mutation altering the translation start codon of ICAT. Real-time RT-PCR showed markedly reduced ICAT transcript levels (<or=20% relative to normal skin and benign melanocytic nevi) in 28/36 malignant melanomas (78%), including 13/14 tumors with LOH on 1p36. Allelic loss on 10q was detected in 15 tumors (44%). We found neither mutations nor complete loss of expression of the BTRC gene in our melanoma series. Taken together, our results indicate that the Wnt pathway may be altered in malignant melanomas by different mechanisms, including rare somatic mutations in CTNNB1, APC or ICAT, as well as low or absent expression of ICAT transcripts.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a distinct tumour phenotype that is associated with alterations of DNA mismatch repair and is being increasingly reported in a number of hereditary and sporadic tumours. Numerous reports have suggested that melanocytic neoplasms, including cutaneous melanomas, frequently demonstrate low frequency MSI, whilst a small number of tumours exhibit high frequency MSI. Furthermore, loss of expression of DNA mismatch repair proteins has been associated with progression from benign to malignant disease in melanocytic neoplasms, but the presence or absence of mismatch repair defects in uveal melanomas has yet to be determined. This study was designed to establish whether MSI is a feature of these ocular melanomas. To investigate the prevalence of MSI in uveal melanomas, 52 tumours were analysed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a panel of microsatellite markers selected for their ability to detect tumours exhibiting defects in DNA mismatch repair mechanisms. MSI was rarely detected in the 52 uveal melanomas analysed. All tumours demonstrated stable microsatellites at five of the six microsatellite markers tested (BAT26, BAT40, APC, D2S123 and Mfd15CA). Only one tumour showed the presence of a single unstable allele at a tetranucleotide marker (MYCL1). These data suggest that high frequency MSI does not occur in these tumours, and that low frequency MSI, in contrast to cutaneous melanoma, is a rare event in malignant melanomas of the uveal tract.",

The lungs are a common site for metastasis for all tumors including melanoma. However endobronchial metastasis is a rare phenomenon. Endotracheal metastases are even rarer, occurring in only 5% of patients with extrapulmonary endobronchial metastases. It is most commonly seen in breast, colorectal, and kidney cancers. It is extremely rare for cutaneous melanoma.

Plasma from mice bearing B16 melanoma for 30 days (plasma d30) showed a more profound immunosuppressive effect on the in vitro proliferation of unrelated antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in the presence of both antigen and antigen-presenting cells (APC) than plasma from naïve mice. The level of plasma transforming growth factor (TGF)- was elevated in mice bearing B16 melanoma for 30 days compared with naïve mice, and the suppressive effect of plasma d30 was partially diminished by the neutralization of TGF-. Interestingly, immunoglobulin (IgG)-bound TGF-, but not IgG-unbound TGF-, in plasma d30 was suggested to be responsible for the immunosuppressive activity. In addition, no suppressive effect of plasma d30 was observed when antigen was added as a class II peptide, thus suggesting that the impaired proliferation of CD4+ T cells in the presence of plasma d30 was due to a dysfunction of antigen uptake/processing by APC. Furthermore, dissociation between IgG and TGF- resulted in a loss of the suppressive activity of plasma d30. Taken together, these results suggest that circulating IgG-bound TGF- is, at least in part, responsible for the impaired responses of CD4+ T cells at the late tumour-bearing stage by suppressing antigen uptake/ processing by APC.",

Immunoblot analyses and immunohistochemistry following gene delivery revealed an increase in AP-2alpha expression in the mouse intestinal mucosa and liver. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments provided evidence for interactions between AP-2alpha, beta-catenin, and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) proteins in mouse intestinal mucosa, as well as in a primary human colorectal cancer.

        "Doc_abstract":"To determine the role of beta-catenin pathway in human skin carcinogenesis, 135 non-melanoma skin tumors were analyzed for beta-catenin expression and gene mutations. Intense nucleo-cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for C terminus beta-catenin antibodies was observed in all pilomatricomas and in single cases of trichoepithelioma and squamous cell carcinoma showing peculiar signs of matrical differentiation. Moderate increase of beta-catenin nuclear staining was detected in a significant proportion of basal cell carcinomas, Bowen disease, spiroadenomas, and occasionally also in squamous cell carcinomas, but in these neoplasms only a limited fraction of tumor cells accumulated beta-catenin. Molecular analysis revealed that beta-catenin gene mutations are a peculiar feature of skin tumors with matrical differentiation and correlate with a pattern of intense and diffuse beta-catenin nuclear expression. In contrast, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and AXIN2 mutations were not involved in skin tumorigenesis. Analysis of Wnt pathway revealed that TCF-1 and MITF-M were selectively induced in the tumor types harboring beta-catenin mutations, indicating that a Wnt/beta-catenin pathway involving TCF-1 and MITF-M is activated in these tumors. Interestingly, high expression levels of TCF-3 were found in basal cell carcinomas and spiroadenomas. TCF-3 is reported to act as a negative modulator of beta-catenin degradation pathway. Thus, the moderate increase of beta-catenin nuclear staining detected in these tumor types might, at least in part, be due to a TCF-3-dependent mechanism. Finally, we found that the presence of beta-catenin mutations significantly correlated with loss of nuclear immunoreactivity for an antibody raised against the N terminus of beta-catenin (alphaABC). Thus, a combined analysis with C terminus-beta-catenin antibodies and alphaABC Ab may represent a powerful investigative approach for the detection of beta-catenin structural alterations.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The membrane bound melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), and the endothelin B receptor (ENDBR) are two G-protein coupled receptors that play important roles in constitutive regulation of melanocytes and their response to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), the main etiological factor for melanoma. The human MC1R is a Gs protein-coupled receptor, which is activated by its agonists α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-melanocortin; α-MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The ENDBR is a Gq coupled-receptor, which is activated by Endothelin (ET)-3 during embryonic development, and ET-1 postnatally. Pigmentation and the DNA repair capacity are two major factors that determine the risk for melanoma. Activation of the MC1R by its agonists stimulates the synthesis of eumelanin, the dark brown photoprotective pigment. In vitro studies showed that α-MSH and ET-1 interact synergistically in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor to stimulate human melanocyte proliferation and melanogenesis, and to inhibit UVR-induced apoptosis. An important function of the MC1R is reduction of oxidative stress and activation of DNA repair pathways. The human MC1R is highly polymorphic, and MC1R variants, particularly those that cause loss of function of the expressed receptor, are associated with increased melanoma risk independently of pigmentation. These variants compromise the DNA repair and antioxidant capacities of human melanocytes. Recently, activation of ENDBR by ET-1 was reported to reduce the induction and enhance the repair of UVR-induced DNA photoproducts. We conclude that α-MSH and ET-1 and their cognate receptors MC1R and ENDBR reduce the risk for melanoma by maintaining genomic stability of melanocytes via modulating the DNA damage response to solar UVR. Elucidating the response of melanocytes to UVR should improve our understanding of the process of melanomagenesis, and lead to effective melanoma chemoprevention, as well as therapeutic strategies.
