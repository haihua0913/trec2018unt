        "Background":"['Background', '  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, with metastatic disease accounting for 40 to 50% of newly diagnosed patients. EGFR monoclonal antibodies (Mab), cetuximab and panitumumab, are effective treatment for KRAS wild type CRC. Although mutations in KRAS predict resistance to EGFR Mab therapy, only 80% of CRC patients with KRAS wild-type (WT) status respond to treatment. This study is a retrospective evaluation of genomic alterations in the EGFR pathway such as  alterations in KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA and PTEN that may predict lack of response to EGFR Mab therapy in CRC patients.  Methods', '  A large database of 5,900 consecutive CRC patients was analyzed from 2011 onwards for demographics (sex, age, geography, site of tumor) and biomarkers that might correlate with response to EGFR Mab therapy. Comprehensive testing included gene sequencing for KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PTEN, and PIK3CA (next-generation sequencing, Sanger, pyrosequencing) and immunohistochemistry for PTEN protein expression.  Results', '  Analysis revealed the incidence of KRAS mutation of 42% which is consistent with published literature. Analysis of the KRAS WT cohort revealed a mutation rate of 13.8 % for BRAF, 6.8% for NRAS, and 40% for patients with either PTEN loss of expression/mutation or a PIK3CA mutation. Earlier studies support that mutations in NRAS, BRAF and activation of the PI3K pathway by PTEN/PIK3CA analysis result in lower response rates to EGFR Mab therapy in CRC. Furthermore, multiplex biomarker testing revealed the rare occurrence of concurrent mutations', ' 1/5,900 subject harboring a BRAF and NRAS mutations, 7/5,900 others with BRAF and PIK3CA mutations, and 8/5,900 subjects with NRAS and PIK3CA mutations.

Prospective controlled studies are in progress to validate the role of BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, and PTEN in clinical management of CRC.

Several studies have shown that specific mutations in KRAS and NRAS are less likely to respond to anti-EGFR therapies. Several diagnostics have been developed to identify such mutations. However, in a large number of cancer patients, tumor biopsy poses a significant health risk thereby limiting the tissue available for current molecular diagnostics. Non-invasive liquid biopsy diagnostics are revolutionizing cancer treatment selection, patient prognosis, and monitoring. Low abundance circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is purified from patient plasma and used as an alternative source of genomic material for detecting tumor mutations. Currently available qPCR kits for detecting RAS mutations have a limited sensitivity and coverage since they are not optimized for liquid biopsy purposes. Methods', ' We have developed a two-step PCR to qPCR method to identify down to single mutant copies of KRAS or NRAS in ctDNA isolated from plasma. The mutant copies are first enriched by a novel multiplexed formula of primers and wildtype (WT) allele blockers. The mutations are then identified by EntroGens RAS Mutation Screening Panel or next generation sequencing (NGS). Synthetic mutant DNA was spiked in a background of WT DNA purified from plasma to yield a range of mutant allelic burden over WT background. The dilutions were analyzed to determine the methods sensitivity. We subsequently used the method to screen 53 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient samples. Results', ' Our two-step method detects single digit mutant copies of 35 clinically significant KRAS and NRAS mutations.

        "Background":"['NRAS mutations are found in 11-14% of AML (Schubbert et al. Nat Rev Cancer 2007, Bowen et al. Blood 2006), implicating NRAS signaling pathways as potential targets for clinical intervention. However, the specific effects of targeting these pathways on AML physiology are currently unclear. We employ a manipulatable murine model of AML to elucidate these phenomena for therapeutic applications. This model harbors a tetracycline repressible, activated NRAS (NRASG12V) transgene along with an Mll/AF9 transgene. Primary leukemia cells are then transplanted into SCID mice and, upon development of clinically evident leukemia, NRASG12V transgene expression is repressed with doxycycline. NRASG12V repression leads to apoptosis and disease remission (Kim et al. Blood 2009). To dissect the critical signaling networks directing remission, immunophenotypic markers, along with the phosphorylation status of critical signaling intermediates, were analyzed by flow cytometry after NRASG12V repression. This analysis revealed that NRAS withdrawal led to an enrichment of less differentiated Mac1/Gr1 negative cells indicating that, in addition to well-described effects on proliferation, NRAS affects leukemia differentiation status. Furthermore, we only found modifications in known NRAS signaling effectors in the less differentiated, Mac1 negative leukemia cells. Therefore, in addition to affecting the differentiation status of the leukemia, oncogene withdrawal leads to cell-type specific signaling alterations. We hypothesize that these signaling alterations mediate remission-induction by altering the self-renewal capacity of the leukemia at the gene expression level. Parallel RNA sequencing and gene expression microarrays were performed to address this hypothesis and revealed that the gene expression pattern of NRASG12V-expressing cells is enriched with hematopoietic self-renewal genes (Krivtsov et al. Nature 2006, Ivanova et al. Science 2002, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis per Subramanian et al. PNAS 2005). Withdrawal of the oncogene led to loss of this self-renewal gene expression program and an enrichment of genes expressed in terminally differentiated, mature cells. Furthermore, the NRASG12V-dependent gene expression program mimics the Mll/AF9-determined, Myb-mediated self-renewal program seen in a similar AML model (Zuber et al. Genes & Dev 2011). These data suggest that the Mll/AF9-mediated self-renewal program requires the continued expression of NRASG12Vand support a novel role for NRASG12V in maintaining the self-renewal capacity AML.']",

        "Background":"['The RAS family includes three RAS genes, which encode four highly homologous proteins', ' H-, N-, and KRAS4A and 4B, the latter two being alternatively spliced forms differing only at the carboxyl terminus. Hyperactivation of RAS is common in human cancer, including hematological malignancies. Since RAS proteins are difficult to target, identification of alternative means to block RAS oncogenic signaling is critical for developing therapies against RAS-driven cancers. The biological activity of RAS proteins relies upon post-translational modifications (PTMs) that anchor RAS to cellular membranes. Among RAS PTMs, palmitoylation is required for the high affinity plasma membrane binding of NRAS, HRAS and KRAS4A. We have previously shown that palmitoylation is essential for NRAS leukemogenesis, suggesting that targeting RAS palmitoylation may be an effective therapy for NRAS related cancers. In addition, it has been shown that KRAS4A plays an essential role in the development of KRAS-driven lung cancer, suggesting that targeting palmitoylation may impact on cancers with KRAS mutations as well. However, the exact role of palmitoylation in KRAS4A oncogenic activity is not known. In this study we compared the effect of palmitoylation on leukemogenic potential of oncogenic NRAS and KRAS4A whose high expression level is detected in some KRAS mutated leukemia cell lines. We found that palmitoylation of oncogenic NRAS and KRAS4A is both critical for their plasma membrane attachment and their activity to activate the MEK-ERK signaling pathway. Mutation at the palmitoylation site of the oncogenic KRAS4A significantly abrogates its leukemogenic potential. However, unlike NRAS, palmitoylation defective KRAS4A still induces leukemia in mice, albeit with a long latency. Using NRAS/KRAS4A chimeric constructs, we found that the KIKK (Lys-Ile-Lys-Lys) motif between amino acids 181 and 189 in the hypervariable region of KRAS4A effects on the oncogenic activity of KRAS4A, though its contribution is less than that of palmitoylation. After replacing the three lysine residues in the KIKK motif with glutamine residues, the leukemogenic potential of oncogenic KRAS4A is partially inhibited, while inactivating mutations of both palmitoylation site and KIKK motif completely suppress the ability of oncogenic KRAS4A to induce leukemia in mice. On the other hand, replacement of lysine residues in KIKK motif with arginine residues does not change the oncogenic activity of KRAS4A, indicating that the KIKK motif functions by providing positive charged residues. These studies demonstrate that KRAS4A contains an additional membrane association motif comparing to NRAS and suggest that though therapies targeting RAS palmitoylation would inhibit KRAS4A tumorigenesis, interfering the KIKK motif of KRAS4A would enhance the therapeutic effectiveness.']",

        "Background":"['NRAS, a proto-oncogene belonging to the RAS oncogene superfamily, is a intracellular signal cascade mediator, with intrinsic GTPase activity, functioning to initiate the MAPK cell signaling pathway. Among the RAS oncogene superfamily that is mutated in approximately 30% of all cancers, the NRAS mutation accounts for about 15% of RAS related human malignancies, particularly myeloid leukemias and cutaneous melanomas. Recently, a stable G-quadruplex (G4) was previously identified in the 5-untranslated region (UTR) of NRAS mRNA. This G4 functioned as a translational silencer, downregulating NRAS protein and leading to the hypothesis that a small nucleic acid clamp could be optimized to facilitate the formation of specifically this G4, decrease NRAS expression, and facilitate cell death in melanoma cells. In the present study, a set of clamps were designed and examined for their ability to facilitate the formation of a G4 in the 5-UTR sequence of NRAS. These clamps are comprised of ribonucleotides complementary to the RNA 5- and 3-regions flanking the G4-forming sequence held together by a small linker element. Based on binding studies consisting of electromobility shift assays and circular dichroism, an optimal flank length and linker length was chosen for cellular studies. Effects on cellular viability and NRAS expression are being examined in leukemia and melanoma cells, and RNA ChIP-Seq is being used to localize the intracellular activity of the clamps to the 5-UTR. These nucleic acid clamps offer a high degree of selectivity for G4s over linear RNA facilitated by the small linker region; moreover, the approach of complementary nucleotides, versus small molecule-mediated G4 stabilization, allows for specificity for just one G4 out of all of the intracellular structures. This approach not only provides a solid base for developing the clamp into a non-small molecule cancer therapy, but also opens a new window for modulating oncogenic gene expression at the transcriptional or translational levels. The current study, in particular, offers a novel approach to anti-NRAS-mediated therapies for the treatment of myeloid leukemias and cutaneous melanomas.']",

        "Background":"['RAS signaling through extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)/mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathway is critical for normal cellular homeostasis and is frequently aberrantly regulated in cancerous cells. Although often depicted as a linear sequence of RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK1/2, this pathway is also regulated by expression of multiple isoforms of proteins at each level, scaffold proteins that enhance pathway activation, and negative feedback mechanisms. Some of these factors may also impact on the response of the pathway to pharmacological inhibitors. To test this notion, we analyzed resistance to the RAF inhibitor, PLX4720, using mutant BRAF melanoma cell models. In a screen to isolate cells displaying resistance to the inhibitory effects of PLX4720, we observed a subset of cells harboring an acquired mutation in NRAS. In parental cells, expression of mutant NRAS was sufficient to prevent PLX4720-mediated inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling, entry into S phase and susceptibility to apoptosis in mutant BRAF cells. Effects of mutant NRAS were associated with the maintenance of RAF binding. Analysis of isolated clones of RAF inhibitor-resistant mutant BRAF cells demonstrated that re-activation of the ERK1/2 pathway in the presence of PLX4720 was dependent on NRAS, BRAF, CRAF, and the RAS-RAF scaffold protein, SHOC2/Sur-8. Depletion of SHOC2 also rendered resistant cells susceptible to PLX4720-mediated apoptosis in 3D collagen. Together, these data demonstrate the role of RAF isoforms and a RAS-RAF scaffold protein in the acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors induced by secondary mutations in NRAS.']",

Research studies have shown that Eph receptors and ligands may be involved in many diseases including cancer. EphA2 is a member of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and is highly expressed in many aggressive cancer types, including melanoma. Our previous studies showed that EphA2 levels are elevated in melanoma cells and EphA2 plays critical roles in melanoma cell survival, proliferation, colony formation and migration in vitro and melanoma tumor growth in vivo. Together, these data suggest that EphA2 is a critical oncogene in melanoma and a potential pharmacologic target in the treatment of metastatic disease. Herein we present early evidence that EphA2 inhibitors (ALW-II-41-27 and HG-6-64-1) are effective in inhibiting proliferation of both NRAS and BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines in vitro through suppressing a series of EphA2 downstream signaling pathways. At the same time, EphA2 inhibitors are also effective at suppressing migration and invasion of melanoma cells with a reduction in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and lamellipodia formation. Animal studies are underway to determine the effectiveness of these agents in suppressing melanoma tumor growth in vivo.

The average median sequencing depth was 450. Results', ' 50.4% (37/72) of the tumors harbored a KRAS mutation, 4.2% (3/72) harbored a NRAS mutation and 4.2% (3/72) harbored a BRAF mutation. More specifically, 82.5% (33/40) of RAS mutation was located in exon 2. Except for RAS and RAF, 4.2% (3/72) anti-EGFR therapy response genetic mutations were found in PTEN (n = 3). Its also worth noting that actionable alterations were found in HER2 (n = 5, including 4 amplification and 1 activating mutation), FBXW7 (n = 3) and others (n = 5). Conclusions', ' Our results implied that 63.9% (46/72) metastatic colorectal cancers with genetic mutations including KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PTEN might not benefit from anti-EGFR therapy. 26.4% (19/72) of samples harbored at least one actionable genetic alteration rather than RAS identified by NGS testing. Significantly, HER2 defined a unique subpopulation of 6.9% (5/72) of metastatic colorectal cancer and might be a promising driven-gene. These findings suggest that high throughput NGS testing in colorectal cancer tissue was a comprehensive and efficient genomic profiling assay to guide personalized therapy.']",

        "Background":"[\"The monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab are approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancers (mCRC). When used as monotherapy, the anti-EGFR antibodies are effective in approximately 15% of patients. It is now well established that colorectal tumors carrying KRAS and BRAF mutations (40%) are refractory to EGFR targeted therapies (primary resistance). Virtually all-responsive patients eventually become insensitive to anti-EGFR antibodies (secondary resistance) within 3 to 12 months of initiating therapy. Primary and acquired resistance therefore limits the clinical benefit of EGFR blockade in CRC patients.We postulated that concomitant inhibition of multiple members of the HER (ErbB) receptors family might suppress the growth of CRC cells more effectively than selectively targeting only the EGFR with cetuximab or panitumumab.Accordingly, we assessed the pharmacological activity of momelotinib and afatinib- two pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors- in a collection of 40 CRC cell lines, which recapitulate the genetic profiles commonly detected in CRC patients. We report that primary resistance to pan-HER inhibition is associated with KRAS and BRAF mutations thus suggesting that this patients' population will unlikely benefit from momelotinib and afatinib treatments. Notably, however, pan-HER blockade was effective in a subset of KRAS/BRAF wild type CRC cell lines refractory to cetuximab and panitumumab indicating that a subgroup of patients, which do not benefit from EGFR blockade, may profit from pan-HER inhibition.To define the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to ErbB inhibitors, three KRAS/BRAF/NRAS wild type CRC cell models were continuously treated with cetuximab, momelotinib and afatinib, until resistant derivatives emerged. Genetic characterization of such derivatives unveiled that, regardless of the drug used, the resistant populations were a mixture of clones carrying distinctive mutations in KRAS or NRAS. Detailed biochemical analyses of the ErbB signalling pathway revealed that resistant variants displayed high levels of MEK and ERK activation, which persisted upon ErbBs inhibition.Collectively, these results identify KRAS, BRAF and NRAS mutations as major drivers of primary and/or acquired resistance to HERs inhibition in colorectal cancer cells and suggest that a molecularly defined subset of CRC patients might benefit from pan-HER blockade.\"]",

Mutated, oncogenic forms of Ras are found in colon, pancreatic, and lung cancers; BRAF mutations have been identified in more than 60% of malignant melanomas and from 40-60% of papillary thyroid cancers. MEK, a dual specific kinase, is a key player in this pathway; it is downstream of both Ras and Raf and activates ERK1/2 through phosphorylation of key tyrosine and threonine residues. MEK162 (ARRY 438162) is a novel small molecule ATP-uncompetitive inhibitor of the kinases MEK1 and MEK2. MEK162 showed promising data in an ongoing Phase 2 Clinical Trial in patients with BRAF and NRAS mutated advanced melanoma. This is the first targeted therapy to show activity in patients with NRAS mutated melanoma. Methods and Results. The melanoma cell line panel was the most sensitive after investigating the growth inhibitory effect of MEK162 on 328 cancer cell lines from diverse histologies including melanoma, head and neck, colon, pancreas, lung, ovarian, liver, kidney, breast and endometrial. When a cutoff of IC50 <500nM or >70% Inhibition at 1uM after 6 days of culture was used 83% out of 47 melanoma cell lines were sensitive to the treatment with the MEK inhibitor. Sensitivity to MEK162 was independent of BRAFV600E andNRASQ61mutation status in this cell line panel. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was assessed upon exposure to MEK162 using flow cytometry. MEK162 led to a G1 arrest and marked increase in apoptotic cells in the majority of the sensitive melanoma cell lines regardless of their origin and oncogenic driver mutations. Western blots were used to characterize the changes induced by exposure to MEK162 in the MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathways. MEK1/2 inhibition resulted in a decrease in pERK in all the cell lines tested regardless of their mutational status and the in vitro sensitivity. We observed an increase in pMEK more prominently in NRASQ61L mutant and wild type for NRAS and BRAF mutations cell lines than in BRAFV600Emutant cell lines. We found pAKT and pS6 decreased in the NRAS and BRAF mutant cell lines after treatment, suggesting that the inhibition of the mTOR pathway by MEK162 may be crucial for the sensitivity to the drug.

Mutations in KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA were detected by next-generation DNA sequencer. Tumors from cecum to transverse colon were defined as RCC, and tumors from descending colon to rectum were defined as LCRC. The median follow-up period was 521 days. Results', 'KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were present in 95 patient (41.9%), 7 patients (3.1%), 10 patients (4.4%) and 23 patients (10.1%) respectively, and there was no HRAS mutation in all patients. RCC was 68 patients and LCRC was 159 patients. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and mutinous adenocarcinoma were significantly more frequent in RCC compared to LCRC (P = 0.031). KRAS mutations were detected in 37 patients with RCC (54.4%) and in 58 patients with LCRC (36.5%). BRAF mutations were detected in 7 patient with RCC (10.3%) and in 3 patients with LCRC (1.9%). KRAS and BRAF mutation in RCC were significantly more frequent than in LCRC (P = 0.012 and P = 0.005, respectively). The incidence of NRAS and PIK3CA mutation was no difference between two groups. In all patients, overall survival was evaluated. On univariate Cox regression analysis, BRAF mutation was associated with significantly poorer overall survival than BRAF wild type (HR = 4.831, P = 0.013).

To further investigate clinical activity of refametinib as monotherapy or in combination with sorafenib in HCC patients with mutant RAS, two Ph II studies for patients with unresectable HCC have been initiated; refametinib monotherapy (NCT01915589) and refametinib plus sorafenib combination therapy (NCT01915602). Since RAS mutations are very rare events in HCC and biopsies are not routinely taken in patients with underlying liver cirrhosis, only liquid biopsies seemed feasible for prospective patient selection. Therefore, Sysmex Inostics BEAMing (Beads, Emulsions, Amplification, and Magnetics) technology based on cell-free circulating DNA in plasma is used to select patients for KRAS/NRAS Mutation status prior to enrollment. Patients are eligible if they exhibit any one or multiple of 13 KRAS/NRAS mutations.Results', ' Between Sep 2013 and Nov 2014 more than 1000 plasma samples from patients with unresectable HCC enrolled in the refametinib monotherapy study or the refametinib plus sorafenib combination study, have been tested at a CLIA certified laboratory in Baltimore, MD. The turnaround time from shipping the plasma sample from the clinical trial site to the results reporting was 6-10 days.

No obvious differences in the incidence of any of the mutations with regards to geography, demographic factors are other baseline characteristics have been observed.Conclusion', ' To our knowledge this is the largest dataset of KRAS and NRAS mutations in HCC. The observed prevalence of RAS mutations of approximately 5% across both trials is well in line with published data including the COSMIC database. Our data support that prospective selection of patients with HCC for KRAS or NRAS mutation is feasible with a turn-around time of 1-2 weeks depending on geographical region. These data further support the broad utility of such approaches for large randomized prospective studies in patients with specific tumor genetic profiles.

Thus, there is a need for improved understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and more effective targeted therapies for this devastating disease. The recent work of The Cancer Genome Atlas Network has defined melanoma as an RTK/RAS-driven solid tumor that can be classified into four genomic subtypes', ' BRAF-mutant, RAS-mutant, NF1-mutant, and triple-wild-type. This landmark study highlighted the important role of the previously understudied NF1 tumor suppressor in melanoma pathogenesis, especially for the 9% of melanoma patients who have acquired inactivating NF1-mutations, but lack hotspot mutations that activate BRAF or RAS. To date, animal models have not been developed for the NF1-mutant subtype of melanoma, which has significantly impaired the development of novel therapeutic strategies for this subtype. Here we report the first zebrafish model for NF1-mutant melanoma, which we generated by combining the loss of nf1 with loss of both pten and p53. The resultant compound mutant zebrafish develop aggressive melanomas from the age of 7 weeks and the tumor penetrance is 80% by the age of 18 weeks. We demonstrate further that these high-risk zebrafish melanomas were exclusive of hotspot mutations of braf and nras. Sustained inhibition of both MEK and PI3K suppressed tumor progression in vivo, whereas inhibition of MEK or PI3K alone was insufficient to suppress the growth of these tumors. Surprisingly, single agent therapy with rapamycin, an MTOR inhibitor, proved even better for short- and long-term suppression of tumor cell growth in nf1/pten-mutant melanomas. Thus our model appears ideal for the testing of drugs that will prove uniquely active for the significant subset of NF1-mutant, BRAF/NRAS-wildtype human melanomas.']",

We hypothesized that an anti-EGFR antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that used EGFR to target the tumor and deliver a cytotoxic payload rather than blocking EGFR pathways may be useful for K/NRAS mutant EGFR expressing cancers. To this end, an anti-EGFR ADC was designed using a meditope-directed site-specific conjugation strategy. This strategy uses proprietary peptides that bind an antibody Fab fragment noncovalently in a unique site outside the paratope. This novel binding is exploited for site-specific covalent conjugation of cytotoxic payloads to any meditope-enabled antibody. The meditope peptide can be designed with a photoactivatable side chain, allowing the peptide-antibody interaction to be covalent.

Secondary resistance to EGFR blockade is frequently accompanied by emergence of mutant RAS clones, which can be tracked in blood. We find that upon withdrawal of anti-EGFR antibodies, KRAS alleles decline in circulating DNA indicating that clonal evolution continues beyond clinical progression. Functional analysis of CRC cell populations, which had acquired resistance to cetuximab, revealed that KRAS mutant clones can decay when EGFR blockade is suspended.

        "Background":"['Our pre-clinical in vitro data suggested that all BRAF-mutated cell lines, and some NRAS-mutated melanoma are sensitive to MEK inhibition. BRAFwt/NRASwt were uniformly resistant. Among the sensitive cell lines, those with enhanced activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway did not undergo apoptosis. This is consistent with a recent phase II trial with Selumetinib, an allosteric MEK inhibitor, which showed a 6% response rate in unselected melanoma patients. Retrospectively, 5 of 6 of the responders were found to harbor BRAFV600E mutations. We hypothesized that treatment of BRAF-mutated or NRAS-mutated melanomas with Selumetinib will induce clinical responses only in the subset of tumors in which the PI3K/AKT pathway is not activated. In this phase II trial, melanoma patients with either BRAF or NRAS mutation were stratified based on phospho-AKT (pAKT) expression (high vs. low), as measured by immunohistochemistry staining of pre-treatment tumor specimens. Patients were treated with Selumetinib 75 mg p.o. daily in 28-day cycles. We found that the incidence of high pAKT melanoma tumors was about 4 times higher than low pAKT tumors. None of the 10 patients in the high pAKT cohort responded, although 4 patients showed stable disease for 4 months. This cohort was closed to further accrual. In contrast, in the low pAKT group, 1 patient had a true partial response (PR) and 2 others had near PRs. One of these patients had to discontinue treatment due to toxicity; the other had his remaining tumor resected. This cohort was closed due to slow patient accrual. We used an exon capture, next-generation sequencing assay to define the mutational status of 230 cancer associated genes in pre-treatment tumors, derived from patients belonging to both cohorts. The assay detects point mutations, small indels and copy number alterations. Among the two low pAKT patients who were resistant to MEK inhibition, one had a mutation in MAP2K1 that encodes for a K57N mutation in helix A of MEK1. We speculate that this is an activating mutation, since a missense mutation in the amino acid just proximal (Q56P) was previously shown to be highly activating. The other non-responding patient in the low pAKT cohort had an activating mutation in EGFR. Both of these could drive increased activation of the MAPK pathway, thus explaining the resistance to the drug. We conclude that future trials with MEK inhibitors in melanoma should exclude patients with high pAKT tumors. The occurrence of complex genetic changes in melanoma requires studies to better stratify the patients according the prediction of response to MEK inhibitors.']",

However, clinical benefit to EGFR blockade is observed in only a subgroup of CRC patients wild type for KRAS andNRAS. Genomic characterization of patient derived xenograft (PDX) models of mCRC have revealed additional resistance mechanisms to the EGFR MAb cetuximab including amplification of MET, HER2 and mutations in ERBB2, EGFR, FGFR1, PDGFRA, and MAP2K1 (Bertotti et al. 2011, 2015). However, not all resistance is understood and the biochemical signaling correlates of sensitivity and resistance remain incompletely understood. Phosphoproteomics allows for comprehensive protein phosphorylation profiling, and thereby may shed new insights into the biology of CRC and the molecular basis of cetuximab response.Aim', ' To identify aberrant signaling pathways, predictive biomarkers, and alternative drug targets in genomically-annotated CRC PDX models by mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics.Methods', ' We performed LC-MS/MS based phosphoproteome profiling (van der Mijn et al. 2015; Piersma et al. 2015) on untreated CRC PDX models lacking KRAS, NRAS or BRAF mutation (n = 20). For comparison, KRAS, BRAF or NRAS-mutant and MET or HER2 amplified models (n = 21) were analyzed. Phosphopeptides were captured by phosphotyrosine antibodies and titanium dioxide. MS/MS data was searched using MaxQuant. Phosphoproteome data (ion intensities and spectral counts) were correlated with drug sensitivity. Dedicated bioinformatics was used to identify hyperactive kinases and signaling pathways in individual tumors.Results', ' The dataset contained 13.418 tyrosine-, serine- and threonine-phosphorylated peptides derived from 4588 proteins, including 237 phosphorylated kinases. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of phosphopeptide intensities revealed subclusters enriched for sensitive and resistant models. Among cetuximab-resistant models, HER2 and MET were identified as hyperphosphorylated and hyperactive driver kinases, confirming the genomic annotation. Sensitivity to combination treatment of both EGFR and driver kinases was observed previously, providing proof-of-principle of the use of phosphoproteomics for the identification of driver kinases.Conclusion/Future', ' This project is uncovering the phosphoproteomic landscape of colorectal tumors and will yield a better understanding of signaling pathways involved, with an emphasis on identifying activated drug targets and predictive biomarkers in this disease, in relation to KRAS/NRAS/BRAF status and response to anti-EGFR therapy.']",

This approach is now widely used to interrogate simple somatic mutations but experience with the analysis of copy number variations (CNV) is still limited. Here, we retrospectively analyzed CNVs in 822 cancer cases (n = 135 melanoma, n = 468 non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), n = 219 colorectal cancers (CRC)) that were sent to our institution for routine molecular profiling using a semiconductor based sequencing platform. Amplifications and deletions inferred by MPS coverage data were independently validated by a qPCR assay. We observed a decreasing frequency of CNV in clinically actionable genes from melanoma to NSCLC to colorectal cancer.Of 56 melanomas with genetic aberrations in BRAF, 31 showed co-occurring CNV in other genes, mainly affecting CDKN2A. Some tumors (5 cases each) revealed clustered deletions affecting either ABL1, NOTCH1, and RET or STK11, GNA11, and JAK3. 8.1% of the cases had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In the group of NRAS mutant tumors (n = 39), 26 showed co-occurring CNVs in other genes, such as CDKN2A and FGFR3, and 9 NRAS mutant cases were additionally mutated in BRAF. 19.1% had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In contrast to BRAF mutant tumors, we did not see any specific CNV clusters. In the group of BRAF/NRASwt tumors (n = 11), we observed 5 cases with co-amplification of KDR, KIT, PDGFRA and another 6 cases with KIT mutations. While co-amplified cases had many gene deletions, KIT mutated tumors harbored only very few genetic aberrations in other genes.Across both NSCLC data sets, we identified 14 cases with amplified EGFR (10 of them harboring co-occurring EGFR mutations) and detected 8 NSCLC with KRAS amplifications (of which 7 had co-occurring mutations of KRAS). KRAS mutated tumors displayed frequent amplifications in MYC (n = 10) and MDM2 (n = 5). Of the 22 BRAF mutant tumors, two harbored mutated KRAS. In contrast to melanoma, we observed no clustering of CNVs in BRAFmut NSCLCs. Within the group of KRAS/EGFR/BRAFwt tumors, we identified 15 cases harboring genetic aberrations in MET (n = 8 mutations, n = 7 amplifications).Compared to melanoma and NSCLC, the number of CNV in CRC was rather low. IGF2 amplifications were most prevalent (n = 13) followed by MYC (n = 9). Two cases showed amplified wild-type alleles of KRAS. Two KRAS mutant tumors showed concomitant amplification of NRAS and three cases harbored amplified EGFR.In conclusion we demonstrate that i) detection of CNVs by targeted MPS data obtained from FFPE material is feasible and ii) could be validated independently, iii) this approach enables detection of known CNV patterns, and iv) uncovers new CNV patterns in clinically actionable targets across cancers.']",

        "Background":"['Glioblastoma is the most frequent brain tumor in adults and is the most lethal form of human cancer. Despite the improvements in treatments, patients survival remains poor. Nevertheless, a subset of patients survives longer than 3 years and they are classified as long-term survivors (LTS). The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the rare phenomenon of LTS are not well known. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are a class of endogenous non-coding RNA of 19-24 nucleotides in length that have an important role in the negative regulation of gene expression. Deregulation of miRNAs is linked to the pathogenesis of many types of cancer. We performed a nanostring miRNA analysis on long and short glioblastoma survivors patients to individuate miRs potentially involved in LTS phenotype. Using this approach, we identified miR-340 as a novel tumor-suppressor-miR in glioblastoma. miR-340 expression was increased in LTS compared to short term survivors. Moreover, a log-rank test analysis on both the data collected from TCGA database and from a cohort of glioblastoma patients present in our lab revealed that low levels of miR-340 were a risk indicator for glioblastoma patients survival. miR-340 overexpression decreased cell proliferation, anchorage independent cell growth, cell cycle and response to temozolomide in different glioblastoma cell lines. We identified NRAS as a direct target of miR-340. Rescue experiments showed its essential role in mediating the onco-suppressive activity of miR-340. The overexpression of miR-340 decreased the activation of ERKs and AKT, the main pathways downstream NRAS. Furthermore, glioblastoma cells stably infected with a lentivirus encoding miR-340 exhibited a drastic reduction of tumor growth in nude mice. In conclusion, our findings reveal miR-340 as a new tumor-suppressor miRNA up-regulated in LTS in glioblastoma.

HER2 mutations are potently inhibited by low nanomolar doses of the second generation, irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors neratinib and afatinib. HER2 gene sequencing of 48 cetuximab resistant, quadruple WT (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA WT) colorectal cancer patient derived xenografts (PDXs) identified 4 PDX's with HER2 mutations (4/48 = 8.3%). Treatment of these PDX's with a single HER2 targeted drug (trastuzumab, neratinib, or lapatinib) delayed tumor growth, but dual HER2 targeted therapy with trastuzumab plus a tyrosine kinase inhibitor produced durable shrinkage of the tumors in mice. After the final timepoint in each PDX experiment, the mice were sacrificed and the tumors excised.

One of challenging issues is to predict response to targeted therapies. Here we report identification of PTPRS, a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase, as a regulator/biomarker of ERK activation and inhibitor response in colorectal cancer. To identify the genes with high frequency mutations that might be predictive of RAS pathway dependence (“addiction”), we used a gene expression signature score to stratify 468 colorectal cancer tumors that also underwent targeted exome sequencing for 1321 cancer-associated genes. We found that, when the masking effects caused by mutant KRAS, BRAF and NRAS was iteratively removed, mutant PTPRS was strongly correlated with RAS pathway activation, with a mutation rate of 10.4% (22 out of 211 remaining tumors). This led us to inactivate PTPRS in vitro using a specific peptide inhibitor, siRNA or CRISPR approaches in various colorectal cancer cell lines. Inhibition/loss of PTPRS significantly elevated phosphorylation of ERK and AKT and substantially sensitized cancer cells to the treatment of ERK inhibitors, which was enhanced by an AKT inhibitor. Surprisingly, PTPRS did not modulate the activity of EGFR and the ERK kinase, MEK. Our data indicate that PTPRS negatively regulates ERK signaling downstream of the EGFR/RAS/RAF/MEK pathway in a mechanism independent of AKT and DUSP6. As a result, inactivation/loss of PTPRS promotes ERK activation and “addiction”, thereby contributing to increased sensitivity to ERK inhibitors.']",

Recent data showed that exon 3 and 4 KRAS mutations as well as NRAS exon 2, 3 and 4 mutations might confer resistance to EGFR monoclonal antibodies. In addition, somatic mutations in other genes such as BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, have been hypothesized to be prognostic and/or predictive in CRC. Therefore, molecular sub-classification of KRAS exon 2 wild type CRC might allow to identify subgroups of patients highly sensitive or resistant to anti-EGFR agents within the CAPRI trial. We analyzed 182 FFPE samples from mCRC patients enrolled in the CAPRI clinical trial by using a next generation sequencing (NGS) approach based on the Ion AmpliSeq technology. In particular, 10 ng of genomic DNA were analyzed with the Ion Ampliseq Colon and Lung cancer panel that targets over 500 hotspot mutations in 22 genes implicated in colon and lung cancers. Data analysis was performed using Ion Reporter Software. The analysis with the IonAmpliseq panel was successful in all the tested samples. Among the 182 analyzed cases, 58 (31.9%) showed no mutations in the investigated genes, whereas a total of 206 mutations in 14 genes were detected in 124 cases (68.1%).

In particular, 30/45 KRAS, 5/13 NRAS, 12/15 BRAF and 19/24 PIK3CA mutant cases showed variants in additional genes. The frequency of mutant alleles also differed significantly among tumors. For example, among the KRAS exon 2 mutant cases, the frequency of KRAS mutant alleles, after normalization for the neoplastic cell content, ranged between 6% and 130%, suggesting that some KRAS mutant cases were polyclonal and that in some other cases gain of mutant or loss of wild type KRAS alleles might have occurred. These data suggest that molecular classification of KRAS exon 2 wild type CRC with the Ion Ampliseq Colon and Lung cancer panel is feasible. This approach reveals mutations in several key genes involved in CRC tumor progression. The relatively high incidence of codon 12/13 KRAS mutations also suggests that an high rate of false negative results in KRAS testing occurs in clinical practice. Finally, the huge degree of tumor heterogeneity might have important implications for prognosis and response to therapy.']",

In addition to mutational analysis, transcriptional profiling has been recently exploited to identify distinct CRC molecular subtypes, associated with biological and clinical features such as cell of origin, microsatellite instability, prognosis and response to treatments. Detailed analysis of the relationships between the subtypes and clinical/biological features requires a large panel of preclinical models closely recapitulating the molecular heterogeneity of CRC. To this aim, we assembled a large collection of 151 CRC cell lines. For each line, we', ' (i) verified genetic identity by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis; (ii) assessed microsatellite instability (MSI) status; (iii) sequenced mutational hotspots in the KRAS, BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA genes; (iv) performed microarray-based global mRNA expression profiling; (v) evaluated sensitivity to the EGFR-targeting drug cetuximab. STR analysis revealed that some cell lines previously thought to be unrelated are indeed derived from the same individual. This result was confirmed by cell line hierarchical clustering based on mRNA expression profiles. Overall, the mutational landscape of the compendium was concordant with what observed in patients (mutation rates', ' KRAS = 47%; BRAF = 17%; NRAS = 0.7%; PIK3CA = 18%). Similarly, sensitivity to cetuximab was confined to lines without RAS or BRAF mutations. Gene expression profiling was exploited to assign cell lines to molecular subtypes, according to five different published transcriptional classifiers. We found that all molecular subtypes previously identified in CRC patients were robustly maintained in the lines. Moreover, significant overlaps were detected between individual subtypes across distinct classifiers. Subtype-specific molecular and pharmacological associations previously defined in CRC samples were largely recapitulated in the compendium. In particular, MSI+ cells were significantly enriched in inflammatory and goblet subtypes and less prevalent in the Transit Amplifying (TA) and Stem groups. Cell lines carrying BRAF mutations clustered in the inflammatory subtype, while RAS mutations were equally distributed among all subtypes. Notably, in TA lines without RAS or BRAF mutations, the fraction of cetuximab-sensitive cells was strongly enriched (56%), confirming clinical data and indicating that addiction to the EGFR pathway is an intrinsic feature of this CRC subtype.

Comparing younger v. older pts, there were no significant differences in the rates of APC (75.3% v. 82.9%, P = 0.139), TP53 (79.5% v. 73.1%, P = 0.261), KRAS (37.6% v. 43.0%, P = 0.403), PIK3CA (9.4% v. 14.6%, P = 0.234), ARID1A (14.3% v. 13.2%, P = 0.884), FBXW7 (11.4% v. 10.5%, P = 0.830), SMAD4 (13.1% v. 7.4%, P = 0.129), BRAF (4.8% v. 5.7%, P = 0.762), or NRAS (3.5% v. 2.6%, P = 0.680) mutations. Additionally there were no significant differences in protein overexpression. However, there was a trend towards increased HER2 amplification in younger pts (5.7% v. 2.1%, P = 0.05). MSH6 (4.8% v. 0.5%, P = 0.015), MSH2 (2.4% v. 0%, P = 0.032), POLE (2.4% v. 0%, P = 0.032), and NF1 (7.9% v. 0%, P < 0.001) mutations were observed at higher rates in younger pts. High TML ( 17 mutations per megabase) was seen more frequently in younger pts (8.2% v. 2.6%, P = 0.02). Conclusions', ' The molecular differences between LCC in younger and older pts are mostly due to mutations in mismatch repair genes. Higher TML may predict a higher response rate to checkpoint inhibitors in younger pts with LCC. The differences in tumor biology observed here warrant further study and may eventually be used to tailor therapy.']",

CancerPlex is a comprehensive next-generation sequencing-based test that evaluates 400-plus genes for mutations and copy number changes, including HER2. In the present study, we aimed to clarify the association between HER2 status and HER2 gene alteration detected with CancerPlex in CRC. Methods', ' This retrospective study included 100 patients with Stage I-IV CRC, who were evaluated HER2 status and HER2 gene alteration. IHC for HER2 was classified as 4 grades according to the immunoreactivity. The patients with IHC2+ were further tested with FISH. IHC3+/IHC2+ and FISH positive patients were defined as HER2 positive. HER2 gene alteration was tested with CancerPlex, and the associations between HER2 status and HER2 gene alteration were analyzed using Fishers exact test. Results', ' HER2 positive cases were observed in 8% patients (IHC3+ in 6% and IHC2+ and FISH positive in 2% patients). CancerPlex results demonstrated that 6% had HER2 amplification, 15% had HER2 mutations, and 1% had both HER2 amplification and mutation. Additionally, CancerPlex detected the other mutations of MAPK pathway (KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, and BRAF). The Fishers exact test revealed a significant association between HER2 status and HER2 amplification detected with CancerPlex (P< 0.001), however, there was no significant association between HER2 status and HER2 mutation.

There is currently no effective therapy for the treatment of RAS mutant cancers. LY3009120, a pan-RAF and RAF dimer inhibitor currently in phase I clinical trial, has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation of RAS- or BRAF-mutant tumor cells in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo. An unbiased screen for compounds that synergize with LY3009120 in RAS/BRAF mutant cancers identified inhibitors of CDK4 among the top hits. In this study, we found that combined inhibition of RAF and CDK4 and 6 by LY3009120 and abemaciclib cooperatively reduced viability of tumor cells with KRAS, NRAS or BRAF mutation in vitro. In animal models, the LY3009120 and abemaciclib combination exhibited synergistic regression of tumor growth in multiple xenograft models with KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF mutation. Molecular mechanistic analysis revealed that pan-RAF inhibitor treatment suppressed the cyclin D1 upregulation which was mediated through CDK4 and CDK6 inhibition by abemaciclib, and the combination treatment cooperatively demonstrated more complete inhibition of RB phosphorylation. These results were further verified by CDK4 and CDK6 siRNA knockdown and another CDK4 and CDK6 selective inhibitor palbociclib. Importantly, the more complete phospho-RB inhibition and cyclin D1 suppression by LY3009120 and abemaciclib combinational treatment led to more significant cell cycle G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis of tumor cells. These preclinical findings suggest that the combinational inhibition of RAF and CDK4 and CDK6 signaling by LY3009120 and abemaciclib is synergistic and should be further studied compared to single agents in the treatment of cancer in patients with KRAS, NRAS or BRAF mutations.']",

Mutations in NRAS and KRAS may affect up to 50% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Recent data suggest the clinical benefit of panitumumab is restricted to patients who have no tumor mutations in RAS, defined as codons 12, 13, 59, 61, 117 and 146 of KRAS and NRAS genes. An Extended RAS panel* targets these codons as a single multiplex assay. A dual strand approach distinguishes true mutations from artifacts commonly found in DNA from Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tissue. Analytical performance of this panel was characterized.Methods', ' FFPE tissue was examined for tumor content and area. DNA was extracted from FFPE tissue, cell lines and plasmids. The DNA quality and quantity were simultaneously determined through a quantitative PCR measurement of amplifiability. TruSeq Custom Amplicon technology targeting each strand of DNA was used to construct NGS libraries. Sequencing was performed on the MiSeqDx, and the Illumina Somatic Variant Caller was used to call somatic variants.Results', ' The dual-strand amplicon approach results in high accuracy by eliminating false positives observed on one strand of DNA typical of an FFPE artifact, by requiring every variant to be detected on both strands. We evaluated performance on 500 FFPE CRC samples processed with the Extended RAS panel. Concordance against Qiagen TheraScreen and Sanger Sequencing results was evaluated. The somatic variant caller yields a specificity of 0.98 and sensitivity of 0.72 for variants in the 5%-10% range, and a specificity of 0.96 and sensitivity of 0.98, overall, where we take the alternate methods as truth. Cumulative FFPE tissue area influences performance of the RAS panel. FFPE of a range of tissue area were tested using 1, 3, 5, and 8 sections per sample. 80mm2 minimum (240mm2 recommended) cumulative tissue area using 5uM slices was optimal for performance and accuracy. DNA quantity and quality also influence test accuracy and sensitivity. A study with 40 FFPE specimens assayed over multiple operators and sequencers produced average coverage of 32,000 reads per target per sample, and over 93% alignable reads per sample. Reproducibility of mutations detected over multiple operators and instruments was 100%. The Extended RAS Panel demonstrates robust performance across many sources of variation, including FFPE DNA extraction method, DNA storage time, recommended DNA input range, qPCR/PCR thermocyclers with little to no impact on sample pass rate and agreement with Sanger sequencing.

What this eventually boils down to is our incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms, the impact of oncogenes, and thus the key pathways through which HDACi affect tumour cell growth. To shed further light on this, the involvement of oncogenic RAS - a key driver of CRC, in determining the responsiveness to HDACi has been explored. By using cell line model systems harbouring conditional oncogenic NRAS, KRAS and HRAS, we uncovered an oncogenic RAS-dependent “safeguard” mechanism imposed in order to evade the cytotoxic effect of HDACi and therefore apoptosis. Characteristically, cells harbouring oncogenic RAS were observed to undergo a reversible senescence-like growth arrest in G2, allowing for re-entry into cell cycle following the withdrawal of HDACi. This mechanism is implemented as a consequence of the direct targeting of RAS by HDAC inhibition, which resulted in a further amplified GTP-binding activity and subsequent signalling through the MAPK pathway. The observed outcome was an increase in the priming of MYC for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, thereby enabling the cells to exit the cell cycle and enter the protective state of G2 arrest. This process was functionally reversed with a conditional non-degradable MYC (T58A/S62A), which in turn rendered the cells more susceptible to undergo apoptosis. Conclusively, in the context of a constitutively activating RAS mutation, the prospect of HDACi treatment was effectively improved using current MAPK-targeted therapy by preventing the observed pro-oncogenic effect of the HDACi treatment alone.']",

Results', ' Of the surveyed mutations,96% (45/47) of typical mts and 39% (13/33) of atypical mts increased MAPK pathway activation above WT (range', ' 107%-211% of WT activity). Within the typical RAS mts, mts in NRAS or exon 3, 4 of KRAS had higher activity than mts in exon 2 (codons 12/13) of KRAS, reaffirming the biologic relevance of expanded RAS testing (median activity of 130% vs 178%, P < 0.001). The median activity of atypical RAS mts was lower than typical RAS mts (110% vs 159%, P < 0.001). Several notable exceptions in atypical RAS mts with high activity levels were KRAS V14I, Q22K, D33E, N116S, and F156L (all > 165% of WT activity). Conversely, within the typical RAS mts in the guidelines, KRAS G13C and K117R were not shown to increase activity significantly above WT. Pts with any RAS mt with MAPK activity above the median of typical mts had a worse OS compared to pts below the median in univariate (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.04-2.32, P = 0.033) and multivariate models (HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.13-3.42, P = 0.017) that controlled for age, gender, sidedness, and synchronous vs metachronous presentation. Conclusions', ' Functional characterization confirmed activity of RAS mts in the current guidelines, but also suggested that a subset of atypical RAS mutations have similar levels of activation of the MAPK pathway. Within the subset of pts with RAS mts, those mts resulting in high MAPK activity are associated with notably shorter OS.']",

Vemurafenib (PLX4032) and dabrafenib (GSK2118436), selective BRAF inhibitors, and trametinib (GSK1120212), an allosteric MEK inhibitor, have shown robust clinical efficacy in melanoma patients 7-10. However, the majority of responses are transient and cellular resistance is often associated with pathway reactivation involving the downstream extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) (reviewed in 11). We hypothesized that pathway blockade at ERK, the last signaling node prior to MAPK transcriptional programming, would not only be efficacious in MAPK-activated tumors but would also have utility in BRAF or MEK inhibitor resistant settings. We therefore sought to identify small molecule inhibitors of ERK. This report describes the identification and characterization of SCH772984, a potent and selective ATP competitive inhibitor of ERK1/2 which displays behaviors of both type I and type II kinase inhibitors. SCH772984 has nanomolar cellular potency on tumor cells with mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or KRAS and induces tumor regressions in xenograft models at tolerated doses. Importantly, SCH772984 effectively inhibited MAPK signaling and cell proliferation in BRAF or MEK inhibitor resistant models as well as in the context of BRAF/MEK combination resistance. Together these data support the clinical development of ERK inhibitors, not only in patients with MAPK activated tumors, but also in patients who have developed acquired resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors or resistance to the recently described combination of these agents.']",

        "Background":"[\"Benign adenomatous colon polyps are thought to be transformed into cancers through the stepwise accumulation of mutations. However, not all polyps progress. A significant number remain static in size, regress, or resolve completely. The mechanisms underlying these differential fates are unknown, and currently there are no biological characteristics that can reliably predict which polyps will grow or progress into invasive cancer. To determine the mutational landscape, targeted next generation sequencing was performed on a unique collection of small (6-9mm) colorectal polyps with known growth rates based on interval imaging with CT colonography. To determine spatial location of identified mutations within a polyp, micro-dissection was performed followed by quantitative PCR to validate low frequency mutations. The mutational landscape of small polyps is varied both within and among individual polyps. Polyps carried 0-3 pathogenic mutations with the most frequent being in APC (67%, 32/48), KRAS/NRAS (17%, 8/48), BRAF (17%, 8/48), FBXW7 (10%, 5/48), and TP53 (8%, 4/48). Additionally, 13% (6/48) contained driver mutations at varied mutant allele frequencies, indicating the presence of subclonal populations. In silico modeling of tumor growth was used to determine the likely size at which additional driver mutations arose in order to observe those varied frequencies. This model of colon tumor growth was adapted so that mutations occur with a given probability of 105, which may change the fitness positively or negatively, and the lineage from these mutant subpopulations was tracked during tumor growth. In silico polyps were sectioned and mutant allele frequency was recorded and compared to the frequencies observed from the targeted sequencing of human polyps. Contrary to the slow step-wise accumulation of mutations theory, these data indicate small colonic polyps can have multiple pathogenic mutations in crucial driver genes that arise early in a tumor's existence. Understanding the molecular pathway of tumorigenesis and clonal evolution in polyps that are at risk for progressing to invasive cancers will allow us to begin to better predict which polyps may be more likely to progress into adenocarcinomas and which patients are predisposed to developing advanced disease.\"]",

Data for the colorectal cancer (CRC) subgroup are presented here. Tumor samples were sequenced for up to 315 candidate genes using FoundationOne (Cambridge, MA). Results were discussed at the Cleveland Clinic Genomics Tumor Board that made therapeutic recommendations to treating physicians.  Results', '  From Aug 2013 to Aug 2014, samples from 45 patients with CRC were analyzed. Median age was 60 years; 23 (51%) were female; 38 (84%) were white. Median time from consent to result was 25 (range, 7-75) days. One (2%) sample had inadequate tissue. A median of 5 (range, 2-19) mutations were detected per sample; APC (89%), TP53 (73%) and KRAS (66%) were most common. A therapy targeting an actionable alteration was recommended in 22 (51%) patients; 88% of these recommendations were for clinical trials. To date, 6 (33%) of 18 patients who switched management after test results received genomics-driven therapies (Table). Previously unknown RAS (KRAS Q61H, NRAS) mutations were detected in an additional 3 patients, influencing EGFR antibody use decisions. The commonest reason for non-receipt of therapy based on the test result was non-availability of clinical trials.  Conclusions', '  Routine tumor genome profiling in CRC patients is feasible and influenced treatment decisions in a third of patients. A genomics tumor board for the interpretation of rapidly evolving information, and improved access to clinical trials of targeted agents are critical to the success of precision oncology.
