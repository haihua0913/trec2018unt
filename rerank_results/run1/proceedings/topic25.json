Thus, investigation of mechanisms involved in metastasis is essential to control this tumor. However, the angiogenesis regulators that are biologically relevant for melanoma are still unknown. We have previously reported that high levels of soluble VEGF in metastatic malignant melanoma (MMM) patients may represent a useful biomarker to predict the effect of biochemotherapy in terms of clinical response. In this study, we evaluate whether soluble levels of angiogenin, transforming growth factor-1 and VEGFR-1 and -2 play a role in metastatic malignant melanoma patients and to determine if they have any relationship with clinicopathological parameters. Methods', ' Using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, angiogenin TGF-1, VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 were measured in sera of 70 patients with a fully documented history of metastatic malignant melanoma in comparison with 30 healthy controls. Results', ' Pretreatment circulating angiogenin, TGF- 1 VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 were detectable, variable in all samples from either melanoma patients or healthy donors Only serum transforming growth factor- 1 levels was significantly higher (p=0.005) in patients compared to healthy controls. No relationship was observed between sex, age or LDH level and all studied parameters. When tumor burden has been taken into consideration, a significant relationship was established between high circulating serum TGF-1 (p= 0.001) levels and tumor burden were found, Similarly, higher serum VEGFR1 levels were correlated with tumor burden (P = 0.02). Conclusions', ' The presence of high circulating TGF-1 and VEGF-R1 in metastatic malignant melanoma patients may prospectively identify high-risk patients with a worse prognosis.

Ipilimumab is clinically active in advanced melanoma, with a 1-year survival rate of ~50% in Phase II studies (Wolchok et al. CRI-CVC annual meeting 2008. Oral presentation). Serum LDH level is an independent prognostic factor for malignant melanoma, and is strongly predictive of reduced survival in stage IV disease (Bedikian et al. J Clin Oncol. 2006;24', '4738-4745.). This analysis evaluated the association between baseline LDH levels and disease control (stable or reduced measurable tumor burden) in previously treated pts with M1c-stage melanoma (metastasis to vital organs other than the lungs) who received ipilimumab in 2 recently completed Phase II studies (CA184008 and 022). Methods', ' Ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg was given every 3 weeks (Q3W) x 4; eligible pts could continue to receive ipilimumab Q12W beginning at Week 24. In study 022, pts were randomized to receive ipilimumab induction dosing at 0.3, 3.0, or 10 mg/kg Q3W x 4; study 008 was a single- arm trial of ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg. Disease control data were pooled from the 2 Phase II studies for pts treated with ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg and stratified by normal and elevated (>1x upper normal limit [UNL]) LDH levels. Elevated LDH was not capped. Results', ' For 227 pts treated at 10 mg/kg, 123 had M1c-stage disease', ' 42 had normal LDH and 81 had LDH >1 X UNL (of which 32 had LDH 2 X UNL).

Methods', ' Using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, circulating Ang-1 and Ang-2 levels were measured in the sera of 67 patients with histologically proven stage IV metastatic melanoma treated by biochemotherapy; 23 had regional lymph node metastasis and 44 patients had distant organ metastasis. Results', \" Serum Ang-2 levels were significantly elevated in patients compared to controls (median 4,856 vs. 2,225 pg/mL, p < 0.001), there was no significant difference in Ang-1 levels, while the ratio of Ang-2/Ang-1 was significantly elevated in patients compared to controls (0.13 vs. 0.066, p < 0.001). Circulating Ang-1 level was higher in men than in women (p = 0.031). Patient's age, Breslow's classifications or LDH levels were not associated with serum angiopoetin levels.

To date 70 patients are completely evaluable (mean age 62.214.58). They received Ipilimumab as first line (35 patients, 50%), as second line (31 patients, 44.3%) or as third line treatment (4 patients, 5.7%).

We evaluated the mutational BRAF status and the number of metastatic sites involved before and after treatment. The cut-off value for aWBC and LDH were determined with time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. To identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers the above parameters have been correlated with Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS).

        "Background":"['Background', ' Coxsackievirus A21 (CVA21) is a naturally occurring common cold intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) targeted RNA virus. Surface ICAM-1 is up-regulated on a number of cancers including melanoma, non-small cell lung, bladder, breast and prostate cancers. CAVATAK is a novel bio-selected formulation of CVA21, which displays potent oncolytic activity against in vitro cultures of cancer cells and in vivo xenografts of a number of cancers. In addition, in vivo tumor challenge studies in immune-competent mouse models have shown that CVA21 lysed tumor cells can induce a secondary systemic host-generated anti-tumor immune response. In this report, advanced melanoma patients were administered multiple intralesional injections of CAVATAK and monitored for markers of host anti-tumor activity on metastatic non-injected lesions.Methods', ' The Phase II CALM (CAVATAK in Late stage Melanoma) study is investigating the efficacy and safety of intratumoral CAVATAK in 54 advanced melanoma patients. Patient tumors are injected with up to 3 x 10e8 TCID50 CAVATAK on study days 1, 3, 5, 8 and 22 then every 3 weeks for a further 5 injections. CAVATAK-mediated immune anti-tumor activity was assessed by monitoring reductions in non-injected lesions (CT-scan and callipers) and assessing the relative serum levels of a panel of immune inflammatory cytokines. In addition, levels of serum CAVATAK and anti-CAVATAK neutralizing antibodies were assessed on multiple occasions prior to intralesional injections.Results', ' Intralesional CAVATAK injections resulted in significant responses in a number of melanoma lesions. However, in addition to melanoma tumor responses directly from CAVATAK-mediated oncolysis, a number of non-injected metatastic lesions displayed significant reductions or even complete destruction. Such anti-tumor activity in non-injected lesions is highly suggestive of being mediated via a host generated anti-tumor immune response. Such responses have occurred at times when no circulating infectious CAVATAK was detected in patient serum and in an environment of high levels of anti-CAVATAK neutralizing antibody. In further support of the generation of CAVATAK-mediated immune anti-tumor activity is the identification a possible novel serum cytokine signature of elevated levels of IL-8 and -IFN in treated patients linked to systemic tumor response. IL-8 is known to be secreted by activated macrophages, while -IFN is produced by stimulated cytotoxic T-cells / NK cells.Conclusion', ' With a number of patients in the Phase II CALM study displaying reductions in non-injected lesions, together with elevated serum levels of the immune inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and -IFN, at times with no detectable levels of circulating infectious CAVATAK, we conclude the generation of a targeted CAVATAK-mediated host anti-tumor response acting on metastatic melanoma lesions is highly likely.

        "Background":"['Autophagy, a catabolic process that maintains cellular homeostasis, is a primary therapy resistance mechanism in cancer. Emerging studies indicate that autophagy is involved in secretion through non-classical mechanisms. However, the effects of autophagy-mediated secretion on the tumor microenvironment are poorly understood. Further, while autophagy is a potential cancer therapeutic target, efforts to inhibit autophagy in clinical trials have been hampered by sub-optimal methods to quantitatively monitor tumor autophagy levels. Here, we leveraged the recent findings that autophagy is implicated in non-classical secretion to identify secreted proteins associated with autophagy in melanoma. The conditioned media of low autophagy WM793 melanoma cells was compared to its highly autophagic metastatic derivative, 1205Lu, using quantitative proteomics. These comparisons identified secreted proteins associated with high autophagy, such as IL-1, IL-8, LIF, FAM3C, and DKK3, which have previously been implicated in tumorigenesis. These proteins were shown to be elevated in supernatants of an independent panel of high autophagy melanoma cell lines compared with low autophagy cells, suggesting a mechanistic link between autophagy level and secretion of these proteins. In addition, secretion of these proteins increased when melanoma cells with intrinsically low autophagy levels were treated with an autophagy-inducing tat-Beclin 1 peptide. Further supporting a mechanistic link, Atg7 silencing in an intrinsically high autophagy cell line resulted in significantly decreased secretion. Finally, serum collected from untreated metastatic melanoma patients with high tumor autophagy levels exhibited higher levels of these proteins than serum from low autophagy patients. These results suggest that autophagy-related secretion affects the tumor microenvironment and that measurement of extracellular autophagy-associated secreted proteins in tumors and in plasma can serve as surrogates for intracellular autophagy dynamics in tumor cells.']",

A high NRL ( > 4) has also been associated to peri tumor infiltration by macrophages, interleukins, various cytokines (IL1-6-7-8-9-12) and interferons. Platelets can release some growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor, platelet factor 4 and thrombospondin; therefore, the ratio of Platelet-lymphocytes (PLR) > 194 would be associated with worse prognosis.

        "Background":"['Melanoma is one the most commonly diagnosed cancers in Australia and while treatment is generally successful if the tumor is identified early, once the disease begins to spread the prognosis is considerably worse. The recent approval of new targeted therapies (Vemurafenib, Dabrafenib and Trametinib) has improved progression-free survival for patients carrying the common V600- B-Raf mutations. However even when these inhibitors are used in combination many tumors still develop resistance and furthermore there is a lack of treatment options available for patients who do not carry the mutated form of B-Raf. Therefore there is a pressing need for new therapeutics to address this deficit.The AP-1 transcription factor family has been shown to play an important role in numerous aspects of melanoma tumorgenesis including cellular proliferation and survival, making these transcription factors attractive targets for new treatments. Therefore, a high throughput screening was performed on several libraries of chemical compounds to identify those capable of inhibiting AP-1 directed transcription in vitro. Two lead compounds (X and BT2) were identified for further testing. From these a number of analogues were produced to modify their activity. Those that showed the most improvement above the leads against several melanoma lines were selected for further testing.The in vitro activity of these compounds was characterised in detail against two human melanoma cell lines, one wild type for B-Raf and one carrying the common V600E mutation. In 2D culture both compounds inhibit melanoma cell proliferation; induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and inhibit clonogenic capacity. These compounds have little cytotoxicity (LDH) and retain their activity for at least a month under a variety of environmental conditions. Furthermore in 3D spheroid assays the compounds show similar levels of activity.In vivo proof-of-concept testing is underway to assess the compounds activity in immunocompetent (xenograft) and immunocompromised (allograft) model. In parallel, bioinformatics analysis of mass spectrometry, kinome and microarray data is underway to identify the exact mechanism of action and the specificity of these inhibitors.In summary, the identified compounds show promising anti-melanoma activity in vitro. They inhibit human melanoma growth and clonogenic capacity and induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in 2D culture at submicromolar concentrations, comparable to the clinically approved drug Tramatenib. They show little cytotoxicity and also inhibit growth in a 3D spheroid model at submicromolar concentrations. The AP-1 transcription family, in particular c-Jun, have been shown to be important players in the development of melanoma. As such, these compounds may prove to be effective treatments for melanoma irrespective of B-Raf status and warrant further investigation both in vitro and in vivo.']",

        "Background":"['Autophagy is a homeostatic process of cellular self-digestion and is an adaptive therapy resistance mechanism in cancer. Emerging studies indicate that autophagy is involved in secretion through non-classical mechanisms. It is not well understood, however, how this secretory function modifies the molecular composition of the tumor secretome, which plays an important role in tumor growth and tumor immune responses. In this work, we focused on the role of both basal and BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi)-induced autophagy in melanoma cells harboring BRAF V600E, a missense mutation observed in 60% of melanoma tumors. Using quantitative proteomics we previously showed that a small number of proteins were differentially secreted by low and high autophagy melanoma cells grown in three-dimensional culture. Secreted proteins associated with high autophagy included IL-1, IL-8, LIF, FAM3C, and DKK3, which have known roles in tumorigenesis. Further, serum collected from untreated metastatic melanoma patients with high tumor autophagy levels exhibited higher levels of these proteins than serum from low autophagy patients. In the current study, melanoma cells with high autophagy and the BRAF V600E mutation (1205Lu) were treated with the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720, the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), PLX4720+HCQ, and the autophagy inducer rapamycin. The increase in autophagic flux upon the addition of PLX4720 or rapamycin was confirmed by western blotting and tandem fluorescently tagged LC3 (mCherry-eGFP-LC3). Secretomes were compared using quantitative proteomics, which resulted in identification of 1154 proteins with a false discovery rate of less than 1%. Hierarchical clustering and principal components analysis showed that secretomes from cells treated with the autophagy inducers rapamycin or PLX4720 correlated more closely with each other than those treated with HCQ either alone or in combination. A panel of proteins involved in extracellular matrix modification, cell-cell adhesion, and inflammation (including FAM3C and LIF) significantly increased in the supernatants of cells treated with PLX4720 or rapamycin and decreased in supernatants from cells treated with HCQ or HCQ+PLX4720. These results demonstrate that autophagy plays an active role in modifying the molecular composition of the tumor secretome. Proteins specifically shed in response to BRAF inhibitors and/or autophagy inhibition may have utility in the clinic for diagnostic and pharmacodynamic applications.']",

        "Background":"['Malignant melanoma patients with unresectable distant metastasis have a very poor prognosis, with median survival of 9 months. Although immunotherapeutic approaches do sometimes lead to impressive results, this can only be seen in a few patients. The level of Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the only established biomarker so far, cannot predict the clinical outcome of single patients. We have previously reported that the presence of peripheral T cells able to recognize the tumor antigens NY-ESO-1 and/or Melan-A not only predicts clinical outcome in late-stage melanoma but is even superior to the AJCC M category. Furthermore, we were also able to show that of the many peripheral blood immune cells, including activated, resting T-regulatory cells and dendritic cells (DCs), only the frequency of one subset of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) also predicted survival. The current study investigates whether these immunological parameters have independent impacts on individual patient survival.We measured T cells reactive against NY-ESO-1 and Melan-A in stage IV melanoma patients with unresectable distant metastases. In order to include patients of any HLA type, overlapping peptides spanning the whole protein were used to expand reactive T cells within the peripheral blood in vitro. Polychromatic flow cytometry with intracellular cytokine staining of six different cytokines (IFN-, TNF-, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-17) allowed us to analyze the phenotype (CD4-versus-CD8) and effector function (pro- versus anti-inflammatory responses) of the antigen-reactive T cells on a single-cell basis. Different immune cell populations (MDSCs, regulatory T cells, DCs) were identified using polychromatic flow cytometry measurements.Based on our previous data, we defined three independent risk groups for late-stage melanoma patients', ' (i) Patients without T cells capable of recognizing the cancer/testis antigen NY-ESO-1, (ii) patients without T cells capable of recognizing the differentiation antigen Melan-A and (iii) patients with high amounts of a certain subset of MDSCs (CD14+HLA-DR-/low cells at >11.8% of PBMCs using a previously-defined cut-off). Each of these parameters separately predicted poorer survival of the patient compared to the reciprocal group. Here, we show that patients falling into all 3 risk groups have by far the shortest survival time (6 months) of all tested patients. Thus, patients with no T cells reactive to NY-ESO-1 or Melan-A, and with higher levels of MSDCs, were at a significant survival disadvantage. In contrast, longest survivors (>30 months) reacted against both NY-ESO-1 and Melan-A and also had low CD14+HLA-DR-/low MDSCs. Our results confirm the importance of NY-ESO-1 and Melan-A as major target antigens in melanoma and indicate that inhibition of CD14+HLA-DR-/low MDSCs might be a promising therapeutic approach, as their lower percentages correlate with better prognosis and clinical outcome.']",

Recently, our lab has implicated the transcription factor TWIST1 in the progression of melanoma towards metastasis. In melanoma cells, we found that RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (ERK1/2 pathway) signaling increases TWIST1 expression, which promotes invasive properties in the dermal microenvironment at least in part by enhancing levels of the matrix metalloproteinase, MMP1. Other TWIST1 regulated targets are poorly described. In this study, we compared expression profiling data from cells expressing shRNA against TWIST1 or cells overexpressing TWIST1 in order to determine TWIST1 regulated genes. KEGG and GO analysis revealed that TWIST1 is responsible for regulating a number of genes involved in cellular adhesion. We found that TWIST1 levels inversely correlate with levels of cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) (NECL-2, IGSF4, TSLC1, SynCAM). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies and promoter assays demonstrate that TWIST1 physically interacts with CADM1 promoter and this is associated with reduced CADM1 levels. Additionally, CADM1 expression is inversely associated ERK1/2 signaling and TWIST1 expression. Modulation of cellular CADM1 levels does not seem to affect proliferations rates however, overexpression of CADM1 augments cell-cell interaction, and cell aggregation. Furthermore, exogenous CADM1 inhibited serum directed migration and invasion through matrigel coated boyden chambers, while knockdown of CADM1 was associated with an enhancement in the migratory and invasion properties. Taken together, these data provide evidence that CADM1 is negatively regulated by TWIST1, and may act as a suppressor of melanoma invasion.']",

In our initial report of 31 treated pts, we demonstrated overall response rate (ORR) of 48%. Due to the evolution of treatment options for metastatic melanoma with heavy reliance on immunomodulatory therapies, we sought to re-evaluate responses in the era of checkpoint blockade. Methods', ' Pts receive treatment consisting of 7 days of lymphodepleting chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. High dose interleukin-2 (720,000 IU/kg IV q 8 hrs up to 15 doses) was infused after TIL infusion. Responses were assessed by imaging per irRC. Results', ' A total of 74 pts have been treated in our initial TIL study with an updated ORR assessment of 43%. Stratification of pts according to their checkpoint blockade immune-modulator therapy prior to TIL ACT, demonstrated that prior Ipilimumab (Ipi) decreased ORR to 33% compared to 51% in checkpoint nave pts and decreased overall survival (OS) post-TIL therapy (median 7.7 vs 24.6 months respectively). There were too few pts to assess the impact of anti-PD1 as a single agent. A multiparametric analysis revealed that LDH levels at the time of therapy mainly influences OS and ORR to TIL but still could not invalidate the impact of Ipi prior to TIL ACT. The durability of the response was also found to be different between the 2 groups (30% for Ipi prior and 50% No Ipi prior). This new reality also impacted previously reported parameters that correlated with ORR to TIL ACT such as the expression of B-and-T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) on CD8+ TIL. Interestingly, assessment of mutation load (ML) of the tumors prior to TIL ACT showed that the check point nave group display a high ML ( > 100) within their tumor whereas some patients who had Ipi prior to TIL have a low ML ( < 100).

        "Meeting_name":" S100B affects MAPK signaling in malignant melanoma via a direct interaction with RSK",
        "Background":"['Establishing the mechanism by which S100B affects ERK and its downstream signaling provided insight into how S100B affects the progression of malignant melanoma and could aid in developing new pharmacological drugs. S100B is a 21.5 kDa symmetric homodimer that is highly conserved and expressed in a number of tissues and cell lines, including melanocytes. Generally, low levels of S100B have trophic effects, while higher levels can have dire consequences, as is the case in human malignant melanoma. S100B is an effective and widely used prognostic marker for malignant melanoma, with its increased level in serum being predictive of disease stage, increased recurrence, and low overall survival. More recently, S100B has been investigated as a potential contributor to cancer progression, which may be related to how it impacts cell signaling, including the MAPK pathway (BRAF-MEK-ERK). To further evaluate its significance, S100B knock-down clones were created from the WM115 melanoma cell line, and a positive correlation was found between S100B expression and cell viability, as measured by MTT assays. It was also discovered that cells with suppressed S100B expression showed significantly lower levels of ERK phosphorylation. Likewise, over-expression of S100B in the human melanoma cell line, 501-MEL, showed the reciprocal effect, with the introduction of high levels of S100B leading to increased cell viability and ERK phosphorylation. However, the phosphorylation status of ERK does not translate to all of its downstream targets. For example, increased RSK phosphorylation was observed in the S100B knock-down clones, and correspondingly, RSK phosphorylation was decreased with over-expression of S100B. Additionally, over-expression of a mutant S100B construct (E31A + E72A) that was incapable of binding calcium yielded neither effect, indicating that the effect of S100B on RSK phosphorylation was calcium-dependent. To determine if S100B interacted directly with RSK, pull-down assays were performed next. Consistent with the calcium-mutant data, RSK was detected in S100B pull-downs in the presence of calcium, but not in the presence of the calcium chelator EDTA. Changes in RSK localization was also observed, where RSK was enriched in the nucleus of WM115 cells when S100B was knocked down and diffuse in control cells. Together these data are consistent with a mechanism in which elevated S100B binds directly to RSK, preventing its phosphorylation by ERK and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus. Thus, the calcium-binding protein S100B affects MAPK signaling by increasing levels of phosphorylated ERK while simultaneously decreasing phosphorylated RSK. Together, these two effects of S100B on MAPK signaling could impact cancer progression.']",

In the current study we set out to identify serum protein marker/s that could identify patients benefiting from ipilimumab.  Methods', '   We performed a retrospective discovery analysis of serum samples obtained before melanoma patients started Ipilimumab treatment. We selected 5 responder and 5 non-responder patients. Response was evaluated based on the first CT scan (W12) after the first course of Ipilimumab therapy. The protocol was approved by the local IRB. Samples were analyzed for 440 proteins using the RayBio Quantibody Multiplex ELISA platform. Results are being verified in a validation cohort of 12 patients.  Results', '    Out of 440 proteins, 29 showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05, two-tailed Student t-test), with 7 proteins upregulated and 22 downregulated in responders. VEGFA levels were not predictive (p = 0.4246). One particular protein showed the most significant difference and was undetectable in 5 out of 5 responders, while 4 out of 5 non-responders in the discovery cohort had the protein expressed. In this cohort, this protein showed a positive predictive value (PPV) of 83% and also a negative predictive value of 100%. We will also present the ongoing analyzes of 12 additional pretreatment samples as a validation cohort. We generated a 10-protein signature, which we are comparing with the single protein predictor. Multivariate analyzes of markers and clinical parameters are ongoing to confirm that protein B alone or the 10-protein signature is a better predictor of response and survival. Recruitment of additional patients in this translational protocol is ongoing.  Conclusions', '   The finding that a serum protein or a protein signature predicts clinical response to ipilimumab warrants further validation in larger prospective studies. (The use of protein B and/or the 10-protein signature as predictors of response to anti-CTLA4 therapy is pending patent application).']",

In the present study we investigate the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of D in melanocytic nevi, in spitz nevi and in malignant melanoma. Methods', ' D expression levels were examined in 12 melanocytic nevi, in 8 Spitz nevi and in 10 melanomas. IHC staining', ' Briefly, the slides were incubated at 4C overnight with anti-D antibodies (Atlas Ab, Sigma) at 1/200 dilution. The epidermidis, adjacent to the malignant tissue, served as an internal positive control. For every specimen, the extent (%) of positive tumour cells and the intensity of D immunoreactivity within tumour cells were recorded. The intensity was graded on a scale from 0 (-) to 3 (+++). A score was calculated for each specimen using the sum between the intensity score and the percentage of tumour cells with that particular intensity. 2 pathologists scored the stained slides. Results', ' Our results showed loss of D expression in melanoma lesions and differential D expression levels and patterns of immunoreactivity among melanocytic and Spitz nevi. Melanomas failed to express D in 70% of cases (7/10) showed very low D expression levels in 20% of cases (2/10) while only 10% (1/10) showed high expression levels (spitzoid melanoma). Conversely, all the benign lesions expressed D (20/20) The differences in the levels of expression between melanomas and nevi were significant (p = 0.006). In benign lesions expression was high in 87.5% (7/8) of spitz nevi and moderate in 91.5% (11/12) of melanocytic nevi. The differences in the levels of expression between these nevi were statistically significant (p = 0.002). Conclusions', ' Our results are in agreement with other studies that show reduced D expression levels in different malignant tumours. In fact the present study shows that melanomas do not express D while benign skin lesions do. In particular spitzoid nevi show higher D expression levels than melanocytic nevi.

CD3 based bi-specific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) were used to determine if redirected lysis of T-cells against CDH19 would drive anti-tumor efficacy. In vitro, the CDH19 BiTEs were high affinity binders to both human and cyno CDH19, and were able to induce specific T-cell activation and cytotoxicity against a panel of melanoma cell lines. In addition, soluble CDH19 levels were detected in human serum and the effects of BiTE cytotoxicity toward melanoma cells in the presence of soluble CDH19 was investigated.

Following miR-4731 overexpression, a selection (n = 81) of pull-down transcripts underwent validation using a custom qRT-PCR array. These data revealed that miR-4731 regulates multiple genes associated with the cell cycle (e.g. CCNA2, ORC5L, and PCNA) and melanosome (e.g. RAB7A, CTSD, and GNA13). Furthermore, members of the synovial sarcoma X breakpoint family (SSX) (melanoma growth promoters) were also down-regulated (e.g. SSX2, SSX4, and SSX4B) as result of miR-4731 overexpression.

        "Background":"['One person dies from melanoma every hour worldwide. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2013 the 5-year survival rate for stage IV melanoma will remain unchanged at about 15%, even with new therapies. Autophagy (self-eating pathway) is a cellular recycling pathway that has been shown to play a role in normal physiological processes including nutrient and/or stress responses, antigen presentation, and aging. In melanoma, basal levels of autophagy appear to vary across tumor types and higher levels of autophagy are associated with increased hypoxia and poor clinical prognosis. Understanding the relationships between autophagy, melanoma and oncogene status will elucidate the molecular mechanisms/pathways contributing to this disease. Our preliminary research indicates that cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) cell lines differ in their response to chloroquine (CLQ), a classic inhibitor of autophagy. This study was designed to determine how differences in the autophagy pathway are influenced by oncogene status and whether induction of autophagy is oncogene dependent. Using LC3-II puncta and western blot quantification we evaluated the differential rate of autophagy by oncogene status using CMM cell lines. The rate of autophagy was characterized in 6 melanoma cell lines (e.g. SK-Mel 2, 19, 29, 94,103, and 147) and primary melanocytes to determine the extent to which these cell lines responded to CLQ and determined any decrease in cellular viability caused by treatment. Two common cutaneous melanoma activating mutations, BRAF and NRAS, appear to have opposing roles on the autophagy pathway in our metastatic cell lines. Our data indicate that the targeting of autophagy using CLQ in the BRAF oncogenic cell lines increases apoptosis and leads a significant decrease in viability. In addition, BRAF cell lines have higher basal protein expression of ATG12-ATG5 and LC3-II and a higher number of basal LC3-II punctae. Finally, the induction of autophagy through serum starvation results in differential basal LC3-II kinetics as measured by number of punctae between the BRAF and NRAS cell lines. These results indicate that BRAF is more dependent on autophagy for survival than NRAS mutant melanoma and that oncogene status dictates the sensitivity of melanoma cells to CLQ by altering autophagic flux, subsequently increasing apoptosis. Ongoing experiments include the evaluation of autophagy in patient samples to quantify expression of known autophagy markers as well an evaluation of LC3-II expression correlated with oncogene status. These findings are immediately translatable for patients that would benefit from CLQ co-therapy, which is already approved for clinical use.']",

        "Background":"['In the clinic, tumors showing a pronounced Warburg effect (high lactate tumors) are associated with a higher risk of metastasis and a decreased probability of survival of patients. Therefore, manipulations of the glycolytic pathway may alter tumor cell metabolism and might be a way to influence tumors aggressiveness, e.g. by down-regulating intracellular lactate levels.To test for this hypothesis B16.SIY E12 murine melanoma cells were stably transfected with shRNA down-regulating LDH-A expression (Lac Low cells). As a control cell line B16.SIY E12 was transfected with a scrambled shRNA construct (Lac High cells). These cell lines were characterized regarding their metabolic properties in vitro, especially lactate production in medium supernatants, the extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rates (OCR). Furthermore, the expression of glycolysis-associated transporters (GLUT1, GLUT3, MCT1, MCT4 and CD147) was determined at the protein level. In a first in vivo set-up ATP, lactate and glucose content of syngeneic experimental tumors were measured using induced metabolic bioluminescence imaging (imBI).Changing LDH-A expression induced differences in lactate production in the two tumor cell lines in vitro with Lac Low cells producing significantly less lactate in 24 h than Lac High cells. Accordingly, Lac Low cells revealed a significantly lower ECAR and a higher OCR than Lac High cells. The protein expression of glycolysis-associated transporters was also influenced by changes in LDH-A expression with Lac High cells showing a significantly higher protein expression of MCT1 and MCT4. The general expression of GLUT1 was unchanged (Western Blot) but membrane localization was higher in Lac High cells (immunofluorescence staining). Measuring metabolite content in experimental tumors of the same cell lines showed that the cells maintained their glycolytic properties with Lac Low tumors showing lower lactate content than Lac High tumors.In summary, down-regulation of LDH-A expression reduced lactate production and membrane localization of glycolysis-associated transporters. The fact, that these characteristic are maintained during the transition from in vitro to in vivo makes this model system useful for systematic studies on therapeutic manipulation of tumor glycolysis and associated pathways.Supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft KFO262, DE 835/2-1 (WMK) + KR1418/8-1 (MK)']",

A decrease in STAT2 protein was evident when tumor supernatants derived from tumors established in wild type and STAT2 null mice were used.

We hypothesized that patients (pts) with advanced melanoma treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1, who were concomitantly receiving a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) or aspirin (ASA) may have improved clinical outcomes compared to pts not using these agents. Methods', ' We performed a retrospective, single-institution review of 167 pts with metastatic melanoma, who were treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1.

        "Background":"['New effective therapies are greatly needed for uveal melanoma, the most common ocular malignancy, which has a very poor prognosis with a median survival of less than one year when metastatic disease develops. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is expressed in 94% of uveal melanomas but is not expressed in normal tissues of concern for toxicity. Previously, we developed an MC1R specific ligand (MC1RL) with high affinity and selectivity for MC1R. We used the MC1RL as a targeting scaffold for development of a radiopharmaceutical by conjugation of 225Ac chelate to form 225Ac -MC1RL-DOTA. 225Ac is a therapeutic alpha-emitting radionuclide. 225Ac -MC1RL-DOTA was synthesized with high radiochemical yield and purity (>95 and >99 % respectively) with an excellent in vitro stability, i.e. 90% after 10 days in human serum at 37ºC. An MTT cytotoxicity study demonstrated MC1R specific antiproliferative effect in cutaneous, ocular and uveal melanoma cell lines. A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) study was completed, where a range of 0-148 kBq (0-4 µCi) of 225Ac -MC1RL-DOTA was administered to groups of BALB/c mice. The radiopharmaceutical was well tolerated at even the highest doses and animals did not reach any clinical endpoints, such as weight loss, loss of kidney function or abnormal pathology. Biodistribution studies on MC1R expressing tumor bearing mice revealed tumor selectivity and a combination of renal and hepatic clearance with minimal retention in other normal tissues. A blood PK study in rats showed rapid clearance of the agent from the blood in <60 min. To determine radiodosimetry, gamma spectra were acquired for tumors, blood and other tissues and organs over a 21-day time period and activity curves generated for each tissue for 225Ac and other gamma-emitting daughter products in the decay chain. An exponential line-fitting of these curves allowed the estimation of clearance kinetics, tissue biological half-life and total absorbed dose (Gy) for each tissue. Doses were highest in MC1R positive tumors and clearance organs (liver, kidney and spleen) and low in all other tissues. In vivo efficacy studies were performed in human A375/MC1R cutaneous and MEL20 uveal melanoma tumors in SCID mice, or syngeneic mouse B16 melanoma tumors in C57BL/6 mice (n=10/group) injected with either 225Ac -MC1RL-DOTA, 225Ac-scrambled-MC1RL-DOTA, La-MC1RL-DOTA (non-radioactive control agent) or saline. In every case a tumor growth delay was observed in treated mice relative to controls, and a percentage of mice bearing the human tumors had complete remission. In conclusion, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo properties of 225Ac-MC1RL-DOTA in this study. This agent demonstrated a significant MC1R-specific in vivo therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model of uveal melanoma with low systemic toxicity.']",

NX is obtained from the bark of the cork tree, Phellodendron amurense. A panel of melanocyte and melanoma cells was evaluated for basal autophagy level and effect of NX treatment, including protein levels and turnover of p62 and LC3B (+/- CQ), and number of autophagic puncta per cell. Trypan blue, MTT, and Annexin V-APC were used to evaluate the effect of NX on cell death, proliferation and apoptosis. Genetic approach using siRNA for p62 and overexpression using HA-p62 followed by survival, proliferation, and autophagy measurements were used to further evaluate the possibility of p62 as a molecular target for inhibition of autophagy seen using NX. We found that i) melanoma cells displayed high autophagic flux compared with melanocytes, ii) NX treatment a) inhibited autophagy in melanoma cells, b) inhibited melanoma cell survival, and c) induced apoptosis in melanoma cells, iii) knockdown of p62 resulted in a lesser inhibition of cell viability and autophagy after NX treatment in high p62-expressing melanoma cells, and iv) overexpression of p62 sensitized low p62-expressing normal melanocytes and melanoma cells to NX-mediated cell death and autophagy inhibition, suggesting that p62 is a bonafide molecular target of NX. Overall, we show that Nexrutine is able to inhibit the inherent high level of pro-survival autophagy in melanoma cells, leading to loss of cell viability and induction of apoptosis, while melanocytes remain unaffected by NX at the same doses. Further, SQSTM1/p62 was found to be a critical mediator of the NX-mediated inhibition of autophagy and cell viability.

        "Background":"['Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer and the leading cause of death from skin disease. With increasing incidence of the disease, it is crucial to further investigate the cellular mechanisms and molecular pathways that lead to invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. Recent studies have revealed that high autophagy correlates with melanoma tumor aggressiveness and poor survival in clinical samples, as it is a common mechanism of resistance to therapy. Autophagy inhibition leads to reduced levels in Wnt5A in a breast cancer model, suggesting a cross-talk of Wnt5A and autophagy in cancer.  catenin, a mediator of canonical Wnt signaling, has been shown to act as a negative regulator of both basal and induced autophagy in a colorectal cancer model. Our laboratory showed that high levels of Wnt5A correlate with increased invasion and metastasis in melanoma and that Wnt5A downregulates  catenin; therefore, we hypothesize that autophagy might drive invasion and metastasis in aggressive melanoma through the regulation of Wnt signaling. To study the role of autophagy in Wnt5A-mediated melanoma invasion, we inhibited autophagy in highly invasive melanoma cells using lentivirus-mediated shATG5 knockdown or hydroxychloroquine and evaluated the effects of autophagy inhibition on Wnt5A expression,  catenin, and invasion using 3D spheroid models. Analysis of autophagy flux confirms that highly invasive melanoma cells have high autophagy compared to non-invasive cell lines. The inhibition of autophagy by hydroxychloroquine or shATG5 both resulted in significant decrease in invasion. By western blot analysis, we also observed a decrease in Wnt5A in these cells. These results demonstrate that autophagy inhibition in highly invasive melanoma leads to decrease in invasion in a 3D model that mimics the tumor microenvironment of melanoma. Further dissection of the molecular mechanisms that are involved in this process will enable the identification of novel autophagy targets in aggressive melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['Initially described as a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and thus a negative regulator of cell cycle, p21waf1/cip1 is a protein whose expression is often altered in cancer. Paradoxically, its upregulation has been correlated with aggressiveness and poor prognosis. p21waf1/cip1 fits the definition of antagonistic duality, since its cytoplasmic functions differ from its nuclear tasks. Our group had previously developed a murine melanoma progression model, which culminated in the establishment of cell lines representing different stages in melanoma genesis. Surprisingly, we detected overexpression of p21waf1/cip1 protein in a metastatic melanoma cell line (4C11+), which exhibits highly aggressive behavior. Despite its aberrant overexpression has already been described in melanoma, including metastases, little is known about the impact of its ectopic overexpression in melanoma aggressiveness. We performed viral-mediated overexpression and downregulation of p21waf1/cip1 in the non-metastatic melanoma lineage (4C11-) which does not express this protein and in the metastatic melanoma cell line (4C11+), respectively, and assessed for its impact on melanoma survival upon Dacarbazine treatment. Flow cytometry analyses were conducted to investigate p21waf1/cip1 cell cycle control in these lineages. Through Western blot analysis, we also evaluated the expression of phospho-Akt and phospho-p21 as well as p21waf1/cip1 subcellular localization, in an attempt to investigate the mechanisms underlying ectopic location of p21waf1/cip1 and thus its oncogenic activities. Our research shows that upregulated cytoplasmic p21waf1/cip1 increases metastatic melanoma survival upon Dacarbazine treatment, which can be reverted by p21waf1/cip1 silencing. We also detected high levels of phospho-Akt(Ser473) and phospho-p21(Thr145), which are determinant in promoting p21waf1/cip1 cytoplasmic retention. Using Wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor that prevents Akt activation, cytoplasmic p21waf1/cip1 level was substantially diminished. Importantly, we identified high levels of p21waf1/cip1 and phospho-p21waf1/cip1 in patients-derived metastatic melanoma cells. We provided new insights about molecular pathways involved in Dacarbazine-associated resistance in melanomas, pointing p21waf1/cip1 and PI3K/Akt as key contributors in this process.

Pembro demonstrated superior PFS over chemotherapy for ipilimumab (ipi)-refractory melanoma (KEYNOTE-002) and superior OS and PFS over ipi for advanced melanoma (KEYNOTE-006). We present 3-year OS data for all patients (pts) with melanoma enrolled in the phase 1b KEYNOTE-001 study (NCT01295827). Methods', ' Pts were enrolled in ipi-naive and ipi-treated cohorts and received pembro 2 or 10 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q2W until intolerable toxicity, progression, or investigator decision. Clinically stable pts with radiographic progression could remain on pembro until progression was confirmed. Response was assessed by RECIST v1.1 every 12 wk.

        "Background":"['Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations occur at a high frequency in melanoma, but the functional consequences of these mutations in melanoma remain to be clarified. In a large study of melanoma samples by The Cancer Genome Atlas network, mRNA expression analysis using RNA sequencing data showed that only TERT promoter mutations at C228T were associated with high TERT expression levels. The effect of hotspot C250 or C242T/C243T tandem mutations on telomerase expression has not yet been determined. To assess telomerase expression levels in melanomas harboring C250 or C242T/C243T mutations, we used real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in a sample set of pediatric melanocytic tumors for which the methylation status and the mutational profile of the TERT promoter were known. We previously showed that in a subset of melanoma, TERT expression is mediated epigenetically by promoter hypermethylation rather than by promoter point mutations. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from 10 metastatic melanomas, of which 8 harbored a hotspot TERT promoter mutation (5 C250T; 2 C228; 1 C242T/C243T) and 2 carried a hypermethylated wild-type TERT promoter were examined. For controls, 9 atypical Spitz tumors with a wild-type unmethylated TERT promoter were also studied. Total RNA was isolated from FFPE tumor tissues and converted to cDNA. TERT expression levels were determined by RT-qPCR by using the TaqMan Gene Expression Assay and normalized with GAPDH as the endogenous control. In the atypical Spitz tumor samples, TERT mRNA expression was undetectable or negligible. In contrast, TERT expression in all melanoma samples was elevated, ranging from 3- to 71-fold (median, 25-fold) when compared to an atypical Spitz tumor as a reference. Our data support that in melanoma, TERT promoter hotspot C250 and C242T/C243T mutations, similar to C228T mutations, correlate with TERT overexpression and that C250 and C242T/C243T mutations likely contribute biologically to tumorigenesis in melanoma.']",

        "Background":"[\"The microRNA (miRNA) miR-126 is highly expressed in endothelial cells and often reported as down-regulated in cancer. The present study thoroughly examines the functional relevance of miR-126 in melanoma progression and suggests a central role of this miRNA as prognostic marker and modulator of the melanoma microenvironment. Initially, the expression of miR-126 was quantified in two independent, isogenic cell line model series of melanoma progression. To further explore its functional role, two stable over-expression cell lines were generated and subjected to an extensive series of in vitro assays. Subsequently, the prognostic relevance of miR-126 was assessed via in situ hybridization on a large melanoma tissue microarray cohort. In both melanoma cell line systems, miR-126 expression was inversely correlated with the level of tumorigenicity. Over-expression of miR-126 in vitro resulted in a significant decrease in colony formation, both in the presence and absence of anchorage, while cell viability remained unaffected. Using a three-dimensional spheroid invasion assay, over-expression of miR-126 significantly reduced cell invasiveness. In addition, a substantial reduction in tumor cell adhesion to VCAM-1 coated micro-channels was observed when the adhesive capacity of miR-126 over-expressing cells was examined under shear stress using the Cellix's Microfluidic Platform. Using in situ hybridization on tissue microarrays containing melanoma tissue, miR-126 expression was evident in the tumor vasculature whereas melanoma cells did not appear to express miR-126. Analysis of the degree of vascular staining revealed a significant association between lower vascular miR-126 expression and lower T-stage. In addition, high vascular miR-126 scores were significantly associated with prolonged overall survival, in particular in high grade tumors (T-stages 3 and 4). Overall, miR-126 over-expression was shown to trigger a less aggressive phenotype in melanoma cells in vitro. Nonetheless, its clinical relevance in melanoma may primarily be mediated by the tumor vasculature. Depletion of miR-126 has previously been linked to a number of tumor relevant phenotypes, including inflammation. Vascular up-regulation of the miR-126 target protein VCAM-1 may mediate increased tumor infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages, which are known to play a crucial role in tumor development and prognosis. This renders miR-126 an exciting target for closer investigation with regard to its role in the melanoma microenvironment.\"]",

        "Background":"['Melanoma is an aggressive disease. Although about 13% of melanoma cases are diagnosed at metastatic stage, the 5-year survival rate for these patients is 16%. We have previously shown that metastatic melanoma cells express high levels of Wnt5a. Wnt5a is a member of the Wnt family of proteins, which play an important role during development and tumorigenesis. In melanoma, Wnt5a signaling is mediated by an autocrine loop that also modulates the activity of midkine. Midkine is a 16kDa protein that is elevated in many different cancers. Overexpression of midkine promotes the growth, migration, survival and angiogenic capability of the tumors. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the activity of midkine are unknown, especially in metastatic melanoma. We asked whether Wnt5a can positively regulate the functions of midkine to promote the progression of metastatic melanoma. To address this, we analyzed melanoma cells for midkine expression and observed that Wnt5a high melanoma cells also express high levels of midkine. Further, an increase in Wnt5a signaling by treatment with recombinant Wnt5a led to an increased midkine signaling. By performing 3D spheroid assays, we observed that higher expression of midkine is correlated with an increased metastatic ability of the cells. The expression of midkine also correlated with an increased resistance to BRAF inhibitors in BRAF V600E mutated melanoma. This indicates that midkine may signal through MAPK pathway to affect invasion and drug resistance in metastatic melanoma. Developing adjuvant therapies targeting midkine can prolong the overall survival of patients with metastatic melanoma.']",

        "Background":"[\"Metastatic melanoma offers an ongoing clinical challenge. According to the American Cancer Society, the 5-year survival rate in 2012 for stage IV melanoma is only about 15% even with therapies. To improve outcomes, it is important to investigate new pathways involved in the regulation of metastasis as possible targets for prevention or treatment, such as autophagy. Autophagy (self-eating pathway) destroys a cell's damaged proteins and organelles through lysosomal degradation and has been shown to play roles in a wide variety of normal physiological processes including energy metabolism, nutrient or stress responses, growth regulation, and aging. The role of dysregulated autophagy in melanoma has not been well characterized. Preliminary research found cutaneous malignant melanoma cells display high levels of autophagy suggesting that this cellular process may provide an active metabolic state for invasive and metastatic melanoma. Chloroquine (CLQ), a classic antimalarial agent, is a potent inhibitor of autophagy and has been used safely in human patients for decades. This study is designed to dissect the role of autophagy in melanoma using melanoma cell lines (e.g. SK-Mel 19, 103, and 147), and primary melanocytes as controls to determine whether these cell types respond to CLQ as measured by cell viability . Similar to pancreatic and prostate cancer cell lines, our preliminary results indicate that metastatic melanoma cells require autophagy for growth and show high sensitivity to CLQ at doses as low as 20uM which resulted in greater than 60% decreases in cell viability. These findings suggest that metastatic melanoma cell lines rely on lysosomal degradation to a greater extent than what has been reported for other cell types. In addition, both N-ras mutation and androgen deprivation mitigate the effects of CLQ on melanoma cells. Ongoing experiments will confirm the expression of autophagy related genes, as well as imaging to determine the rate of autophagy in these cell lines. Finally, we will introduce stripped hormonal factors including vitamin D and estrogen, to evaluate whether this addition will progressively restore the original chloroquine sensitive phenotype. Findings from this work have the potential to be immediately translatable to patients as CLQ is already approved for therapeutic use in other human diseases.\"]",
