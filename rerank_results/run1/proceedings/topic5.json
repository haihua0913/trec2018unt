        "Background":"['Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer and the leading cause of death from skin disease. The BRAF(V600E) mutation is found in approximately 60% of melanomas. It causes constitutive activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in these tumors leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Inhibition of BRAF(V600E) induces apoptosis in melanoma cells which has been used as the basis for molecular targeted therapy of melanoma. Small-molecule compounds such as Vemurafenib, Dabrafenib and other selective BRAF(V600E) inhibitors specifically bind BRAF(V600E), and have been shown to cause dramatic, but transient, tumor regression in vivo. The precise mechanisms of cell death following BRAF inhibition remain obscure; the literature posits a diversity of ways in which apoptosis is induced. However, it is unclear whether a single but complex network is involved or whether mechanisms differ from one cell type to the next. This is an important issue because use of BRAF(V600E) inhibitors in the treatment of melanoma is seriously challenged by the absence of durable responses; even in initially responsive patients tumors usually re-emerge within months and are observed to be drug resistant. An important challenge is thus to understand determinants of initial sensitivity to BRAF inhibition beyond V600E mutation and to determine which of these are involved in resistance.Using high throughput measurement of the abundance and state of modification of multiple proteins representing diverse signaling pathways at the basal level and over time in multiple melanoma cell lines exposed to different doses of BRAF inhibitors and data-driven mathematical modeling, we determine how the complex dynamics of signaling pathways are controlled in different cell lines and how drugs targeting BRAF(V600E) alter this signaling. Our analysis shows that the basal level of some proteins such as PTEN, pERK, pS6, pAkt, and -catenin vary up to 100-fold among different lines prior drug treatment. Further, these cell lines show different degrees of oncogene addiction and remarkable diversity with respect to the level of ERK inhibition and apoptosis as well as activation or inhibition of other signaling cascades following BRAF inhibition. We use mathematical modeling to relate basal levels of signaling proteins and their dynamics following BRAF inhibition to pharmacological descriptors of sensitivity to multiple BRAF drugs. Thus, we identify key signaling nodes within the signaling networks of the melanoma cells which determine the differential phenotypic consequences of BRAF inhibition. This approach will be critical for predicting and ultimately improving drug sensitivity in resistant tumors (e.g. via co-treatment strategies).']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma, the most lethal form of skin cancer, is marked by numerous genetic modifications, including point mutations as well as overexpression and deletion of genes. Intrinsic and acquired resistance to BRAF V600E targeted therapies (BRAFi) in metastatic melanoma patients further underscores the need for global profiling of melanoma circuitry at the functional level. Therefore, activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) and phosphoproteomics was carried out to decipher steady state differences in global signaling mechanisms in nave and BRAFi resistant melanoma cell lines with BRAF V600E mutations.Four cell lines (A375, 1205Lu, WM164 and WM793) were selected to evaluate different molecular backgrounds of BRAF mutation based on their PTEN status (either WT or null). For each cell type, both the nave and BRAFi resistant lines were analyzed via ABPP as well as chemical labeling with tandem mass tags (TMT) prior to discovery phosphoproteomics. While the ABPP approach mined for kinases, phosphoproteomics identified STY phosphorylated peptides providing information on signaling via kinase substrates. LC-MS/MS discovery proteomics (RSLC and Q Exactive, Thermo) identified and relatively quantified all peptides observed in ABPP and TMT phosphoproteomics experiments. MaxQuant was used for data evaluation; preliminary statistical analyses were performed in Perseus to select significant differences for pathway mapping (GeneGO, Metacore) and follow up experiments using siRNA or pharmacological inhibition. Adaptive responses to combination treatment were also explored using the SysQuant workflow for quantitative expression analysis and phosphoproteomics. These experiments served as a basis for comparison for a pilot project of 12 metastatic tumors from BRAF mutant melanoma patients selected for comparison of good and poor survival outcomes.ABPP measurements on different cell line models (A375, 1205Lu, WM793 and WM164) reveal significant differences in ATP uptake of proteins in the resistant cell line model compared to its nave counterpart. For example, in the 1205Lu cell line several proteins including EGFR, p38alpha, DNA-PK formed an interconnected pathway. Overall we identified between 2,000-2,800 proteins in each cell line with 150 kinases. Isobaric labeling coupled to phosphoproteomics identified 1,600 quantifiable proteins with 4,000 phosphorylation sites. Phosphoproteomics revealed concomitant increase in phosphorylation levels of the substrates acted upon by kinases showing higher ATP uptake in ABPP measurements. For example, in 1205Lu BRAFi resistant cells, CDK1, CDK2 and DNA-PK showed higher ATP uptake and their substrates SSK1, DPYSL3, and vimentin showed higher phosphorylation levels.The complementary nature of the two functional proteomics approaches provided holistic overview of signalling network in melanoma and enabled selection of targets for follow-up studies.']",

        "Background":"['Vemurafenib is a BRAF inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of BRAF V600E-positive metastatic melanoma after a phase III clinical trial demonstrated improved survival in patients taking vemurafenib compared to dacarbazine. As the first personalized treatment for metastatic melanoma to show a survival benefit, vemurafenib is a major breakthrough in the field. Although tumors in patients frequently shrink significantly within weeks of initiation of treatment, resistance eventually develops in many patients, with a median progression free survival of approximately 7 months. Evaluation of the biomarker and phenotypic correlates of response are difficult to determine as paired pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsies generally only represent one on-treatment time point when available. A better in vivo understanding of the effects of BRAF inhibitor-treatment of relevant mouse models may yield insights into the nature of the clinical response and subsequent relapse. The conditional BRAF/PTEN mouse model of melanoma that we co-developed is ideal to study this process. In this non-xenograft model, expression of BRAF V600E and loss of PTEN is under control of the Cre-Lox recombination system. Expression of the Cre recombinase is under control of the tyrosinase promoter, ensuring that recombination is limited to melanocytes. The Cre recombinase is fused to an estrogen receptor that inhibits the activity of the recombinase. Activation of the Cre recombinase requires topical application of 4-hydroxytamoxifen, allowing for induction of recombination at specific time points in the life span of the mouse. The use of this mouse model allows for more thorough evaluation of the time course and phenotype of BRAF-inhibitor response in melanoma in an immunocompetent host. Specific studies include evaluation of the effect of PLX4720 on the expression, localization, and activation of proteins involved with growth arrest, apoptosis, and glucose uptake.']",

        "Background":"['Despite recent success of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib in the clinic, nearly all of those treated follow a course in which initial tumor regression was followed by eventual relapse, which constitutes a major barrier to long-term therapeutic management of melanoma. We have identified a novel mechanism of microenvironment-mediated drug resistance that arises from the release of TGF from melanomas that lack PTEN expression leading to the recruitment of host fibroblasts and the generation of a protective microenvironment through autocrine and paracrine fibronectin secretion facilitating therapeutic escape. Preliminary studies show that BRAF V600E mutant melanoma cell lines that lacked PTEN expression dramatically increased their secretion of TGF- following vemurafenib treatment, as detected by western blot, immunofluorescence and ELISA assays. Furthermore, autocrine TGF secretion initiated with vemurafinib treatment stimulated the upregulation and secretion of fibronectin in PTEN- cells. The vemurafenib-mediated ECM remodeling in this case was dependent upon autocrine TGF signaling and could be attenuated following pre-treatment with the TGF receptor kinase inhibitor SB505124 or by siRNA knockdown of TGF receptor I. A mass spectrometry based phospho-proteomic screen in conjunction with innovative network modeling approaches suggested that increased integrin 51 signaling was a key adaptive response of PTEN- melanoma cells to BRAF inhibitor therapy. The importance of increased fibronectin expression and integrin 51 signaling in the therapeutic escape of PTEN- melanoma cells was confirmed by the significant increases in vemurafenib-induced apoptosis observed following siRNA knockdown of either integrin 5, 1, or fibronectin expression. A mass spectrometry screen (LC-MRM) of 18 BH3 proteins demonstrated Mcl-1 and Bak to be critical apoptosis regulators in the microenvironment-mediated drug resistance response. The importance of PTEN loss and Mcl-1 downregulation in therapeutic escape was validated in PTEN- melanoma cell lines expressing doxycycline inducible forms of PTEN, lipid phosphatase mutant PTEN and Mcl-1. Novel organotypic co-culture models were developed to demonstrate that TGF- released from PTEN- melanoma cell lines activated host fibroblasts leading to the attenuation of drug response in the tumor cells. Our overall hypothesis is that BRAF inhibition remodels both the melanoma and host microenvironments to provide a protective sanctuary for the minor populations of melanoma cells that escape therapy. We postulate that tumor eradication can only be achieved by a dual therapeutic strategy that targets both the bulk tumor and the microenvironment.']",

        "Background":"['Malignant melanomas account for a substantial proportion of cancers worldwide and are largely resistant to conventional therapy. The heterogeneity and the invasiveness of melanomas present notable challenges for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, several mutations in RAF, RAS, and PTEN were identified that allow for prognosis of cancer development and progression. Therefore, inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway form attractive candidates for molecular-based targeted treatment of melanoma cancer. Here, we present the molecular characterization and chemosensitivity profiling of 18 human melanoma cell lines. Eight of these were established by Oncotest from human tumor xenografts originally derived from primary patient material. The molecular profiling included mutational analysis for BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS, NRAS, TP53, and PTEN by sequencing. The chemosensitivity profiles were determined in vitro using a fluorescence-based cytotoxicity assay and included commonly used chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of melanoma, targeted agents (sorafenib and bortezomib) and various BRAF (PLX-4032, PLX-4720, GDC-0879) and MEK (CI-1040, PD0325901) inhibitors. The clinically relevant BRAF V600E substitution was the most prevalent mutation and was found in more than 50% of the melanoma cell lines. The chemosensitivity profiling revealed diverse patterns of selectivity and potency with mean IC50 values between 0.4 nM (vinblastine) and 8.3 M (carboplatin). Each of the BRAF inhibitors tested was clearly more active in melanoma cell lines carrying a BRAF mutation. On average, IC50 values of BRAF inhibitors were more than 20-fold lower for the BRAF V600E mutated cell lines compared to the wild type cell lines. However, the BRAF mutated cell line MEXF 462NL was resistant towards BRAF inhibitors and it is warranted to compare its gene expression profile and mutational status with BRAF mutated cell lines responding to BRAF inhibitors. By using an ex vivo clonogenic assay, similar activity patterns for BRAF inhibitors were found, with mutated BRAF tumor xenografts showing markedly higher sensitivity. Potential synergistic activity of BRAF inhibitors with other inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway or with standard chemotherapeutic agents will be presented. The mutational status of selected cancer related genes, as well as responsiveness towards many cytotoxic and targeted agents was analyzed for 18 melanoma cell lines. This extensive genotypic and phenotypic characterization makes this melanoma cell line panel a valuable tool for in vitro profiling of novel compounds, in particular inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma is increasing in incidence by up to 3% annually, and metastatic melanoma, which is resistant to most conventional therapies, has a poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%. Immunotherapy is able to yield durable response in melanoma; however, the response rate is limited (20-30%). It has been shown that tumor immunogenicity is highly correlated to the response to immunotherapy. The mutational load and the characteristics of the neoantigens displayed by the tumor cells are theorized to play an important role in the immunogenicity of the tumor. We used genetically engineered preclinical mouse models to study the role of these neoantigens in melanoma response to immune therapy. Three syngeneic C57BL/6 mouse melanoma models were developed', ' UV induced melanoma in albino BRAF(V600E);PTEN-/- mice (1), DMBA induced melanoma in pigmented HGF-tg;CDK4(R24C) mice (2), and UV induced melanoma in pigmented HGF-tg mice. These three models were found to have varying degrees of tumor immunogenicity based on vaccination studies. The UV induced BRAF(V600E);PTEN-/- model displayed poor immunogenicity, while the DMBA induced HGF-tg;CDK4(R24C) model exhibited moderate immunogenicity and the UV induced HGF-tg model showed the highest immunogenicity. Exome sequencing results showed that high immunogenicity is associated with mutations of genes in DNA damage responses and frameshift mutations. To test the role of neoantigens, RNA from each of the melanoma models was sequenced and analyzed for mutational and expression profiles. We will be comparing the response of these three mouse models to correlate immunogenicity with response to anti-CTLA-4 therapy. We plan to analyze the pathways in which mutated genes were enriched, allowing the identification of druggable targets to enhance therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. CRISPR/Cas9-based screening approaches will be used to identify specific neoantigens able to influence response to immune therapy. In conclusion, our preclinical mouse models show that tumor immunogenicity may be correlated to the carcinogenic mechanisms, and RNA sequence has provided further insight into the role of mutational load and neo-epitopes on immune-based therapeutic response.(1) Provided by Marcus Bosenberg (Yale School of Medicine, New Heaven, CT), Martin McMahon (Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT).(2) Provided by Thomas Tueting (University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany).']",

Nine of 11 BRAFV600E, 4/5 BRAFV600K and 1/1 BRAFV600D mutant lines were sensitive to GSK2118436 (IC50<0.3M). These sensitive lines had wild-type MEK1/2 with or without PTEN mutations. Two of the three lines insensitive to GSK2118436 had either MEK1P124S or MEK2K66_K68del mutations. GSK2118436 treatment decreased MEK and ERK phosphorylation and cyclin D1 in both the sensitive and insensitive lines.

Cell lines sensitive to GSK2118436 were also sensitive to the allosteric MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 (IC50<0.01M). The combination of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 had a synergistic to additive effect on cell growth inhibition in the sensitive lines, but had minimal benefit in the three insensitive lines. Although 5/6 PTEN NULL lines were sensitive to GSK2118436 based on their IC50s, growth of these lines was inhibited less effectively by GSK2118436 compared to the PTEN WT lines evaluated by IC70. PTEN NULL cells displayed higher levels of basal AKT phosphorylation (pAKT) than PTEN WT lines. Treatment of PTEN NULL lines with GSK2118436 increased pAKT while similar treatment of PTEN WT lines decreased pAKT and increased PTEN expression. In combination with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor GSK2126458, GSK2118436 or GSK1120212 effectively inhibited MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR signaling, enhanced cell growth inhibition, and induced apoptosis evaluated by caspase 3/7 activation and/or PARP cleavage in both PTEN WT and PTEN NULL lines.

DNA microarray analysis demonstrated decreased FGFR1-4 expression in BRAFmu melanoma, while qPCR analysis showed that FGFR2 and FGFR3 expression were significantly higher in BRAFwt than BRAFmu in human melanoma tissues. E7080 inhibited in vitro proliferation of BRAFwt melanoma, which overexpressed FGFR3. Knockdown of FGFR3, FRS-2a, NRAS and AKT-3 genes with siRNA transfection inhibited proliferation of E7080-sensiteve melanoma.  Conclusions', '  BRAF/PTEN mutation status was associated with pericyte coverage of tumor vessels and the expression of FGFR1-4 in a panel of melanoma cell lines. E7080 showed superior anti-tumor activity against BRAFwt melanoma, in which the type of tumor vessels was sensitive to angiogenesis inhibition by E7080 and a subgroup of which were dependent on FGFR3 signaling.']",

Thus, there is a need for improved understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and more effective targeted therapies for this devastating disease. The recent work of The Cancer Genome Atlas Network has defined melanoma as an RTK/RAS-driven solid tumor that can be classified into four genomic subtypes', ' BRAF-mutant, RAS-mutant, NF1-mutant, and triple-wild-type. This landmark study highlighted the important role of the previously understudied NF1 tumor suppressor in melanoma pathogenesis, especially for the 9% of melanoma patients who have acquired inactivating NF1-mutations, but lack hotspot mutations that activate BRAF or RAS. To date, animal models have not been developed for the NF1-mutant subtype of melanoma, which has significantly impaired the development of novel therapeutic strategies for this subtype. Here we report the first zebrafish model for NF1-mutant melanoma, which we generated by combining the loss of nf1 with loss of both pten and p53. The resultant compound mutant zebrafish develop aggressive melanomas from the age of 7 weeks and the tumor penetrance is 80% by the age of 18 weeks. We demonstrate further that these high-risk zebrafish melanomas were exclusive of hotspot mutations of braf and nras. Sustained inhibition of both MEK and PI3K suppressed tumor progression in vivo, whereas inhibition of MEK or PI3K alone was insufficient to suppress the growth of these tumors. Surprisingly, single agent therapy with rapamycin, an MTOR inhibitor, proved even better for short- and long-term suppression of tumor cell growth in nf1/pten-mutant melanomas. Thus our model appears ideal for the testing of drugs that will prove uniquely active for the significant subset of NF1-mutant, BRAF/NRAS-wildtype human melanomas.']",

        "Background":"['The RAS-RAF-MEK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways are two major signaling pathways involved in human cancer. Components of these two pathways are frequently mutated in a wide variety of solid tumors. Concurrent double mutations in the two pathways are also observed quite often in a broad range of tumor types. Additionally, inhibition of one of these pathways often leads to the upregulation of the other pathway and development of resistance. In preclinical models, combined inhibition of both pathways has been shown to impart greater efficacy as compared to inhibition of either pathway alone. ASN003 is a novel, highly selective, small-molecule inhibitor of both RAS-RAF and PI3K pathways, discovered using a rational design approach. ASN003 shows potent inhibitory activity against B-RAF and PI3K kinases (low nM IC50). Within the PI3K family, ASN003 has high selectivity for inhibition of PI3Kα and PI3Kδ over PI3Kβ. In a panel of 292 kinases, ASN003 showed high selectivity for inhibiting B-RAF and PI3 kinases, and associated mutant kinases. In cell-based mechanistic studies, ASN003 inhibited phosphorylation of ERK, AKT and S6, and showed strong antiproliferative activity (IC50 = 60-300 nM) in cell lines with B-RAF and PI3K pathway mutations as well as in vemurafenib-resistant cell lines. In pharmacodynamic studies in multiple tumor models, ASN003 showed strong inhibition of the phosphorylation of downstream targets of B-RAF and PI3K, confirming appropriate target engagement. In in vivo efficacy studies, ASN003 showed strong tumor growth inhibition or regression in multiple tumor xenograft models, including A375 (B-Raf V600E mutation), RKO (B-Raf V600E and PIK3CA mutations), and A2058 (B-Raf V600E mutation and PTEN loss). We now report that ASN003 also showed strong tumor growth inhibition (>80%) in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model established from a relapsed patient with progressive B-Raf mutant melanoma who showed initial response to vemurafenib. Sequencing analysis showed that the vemurafenib resistant tumor acquired a concurrent PIK3CA mutation. Dual targeting of the B-RAF and PI3K pathways with ASN003 has the potential to treat and/or prevent the acquired resistance to selective B-RAF inhibitors, and may also treat a broader patient population and provide greater efficacy and survival benefit than selective B-RAF inhibitors or selective PI3K pathway inhibitors alone.

A major advantage of this system is the ability to model the multi-step process of carcinogenesis in immune-competent mice using retroviral-mediated gene delivery. Mutant BRaf has been demonstrated to cooperate with Pten loss to induce metastatic melanoma in mice but the role of Akt in this context has not been evaluated. This is relevant because 60% of human melanomas contain amplification and activation of AKT. In this study, we evaluated the role of mutant Braf in melanoma initiation in the context of Ink4a/Arf loss and Akt activation. Ink4a/Arflox/lox mice expressing the viral receptor TVA specifically in melanocytes under control of the dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) promoter were crossed to Ptenlox/lox mice and mice carrying a conditional BrafV600E allele, which can be activated by Cre expression (BrafCA). Cohorts of newborn mice were injected subcutaneously with retroviruses containing Cre recombinase. Melanoma developed in 100% (8/8) of the DCT-TVA/BrafCA mice following Cre mediated Braf activation combined with Pten and Ink4a/Arf loss; median survival was 62  6.7 days in this cohort. The incidence was reduced to 43% (6/14) if Pten was retained (Pten+/+ mice); median survival of tumor bearing mice in this group was 72  6.7 days. Kaplan Meier survival analysis revealed a highly significant difference between these cohorts (P = 0.01). Interestingly, Akt expression could substitute for Pten loss in this context. Melanoma developed in 88% (15/17) of the DCT-TVA/BrafCA mice following viral delivery of activated Akt and Cre, which mediated Braf activation combined with Ink4a/Arf loss; median survival of tumor bearing mice in this group was 60  6.6 days. Kaplan Meier survival analysis revealed that there was no significant difference between cohorts with Pten loss or Akt expression (P = 0.658). Expression of virally delivered Akt in the absence of Cre did not lead to tumor formation in control cohorts (0/7) and no uninfected mice developed melanoma (0/14). Histological examination of the tumors generated in the BrafCA mice with delivery of Cre and Akt viruses demonstrated that they were very similar to tumors lacking Pten. Importantly, the tumors were similar to human melanoma consisting primarily of short spindle cells exhibiting high grade nuclear features and prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures were abundant, and some tumors possessed giant cells with epitheliod features. Occasional neoplasms exhibited regions of necrosis.

Methods', ' Proteins isolated from 99 frozen melanoma tumors were measured by reverse phase protein arrays (RRPA). A total of 53 proteins were assessed using validated antibodies.

Results', ' Samples from 75 regional metastases (LN or in-transit) and 24 distant metastases were analyzed. Technical replicates (same lysate) and biological replicates (same tumor, different lysates) demonstrated average Pearson correlation coefficients (r) of > 0.90, supporting the high technical quality of the analysis. A positive correlation was observed between levels of p-AKT and known AKT substrates p-GSK3 and p-TSC2 (p < 0.001 for both), and a negative correlation with PTEN (p < 0.01), supporting the maintenance of phosphorylation events during sample processing. Relative differences in p-AKT by RPPA were also confirmed by immunohistochemistry of representative tumors. Tumors with BRAF mutations had higher levels of p-AKT than tumors with NRAS mutations (p = 0.03). Indeed, tumors with NRAS mutations had p-AKT levels similar to tumors wild-type for BRAF and NRAS (p =0.73). Detailed analysis demonstrated that all tumors with elevated p-AKT had low PTEN expression. Similar results were seen in human melanoma cell lines. Analysis of distant metastases demonstrated that brain metastases had higher levels of p-AKT, p-GSK3, and p-TSC2, and lower levels of PTEN, compared to metastases to the lung or liver.

Most of the currently studied mouse melanoma models are driven by RAS/RAF/MAPK activation via activating RAS or RAF mutations in combination with loss of INK4A/ARF or PTEN; therefore, BRAF/NRAS wild-type melanoma remains less well characterized and the overall survival of patients with metastatic BRAF/NRAS wild-type melanoma remains poor.In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that NEDD9 could synergize with the loss of PTEN and INK4A/ARF in melanoma tumorigenesis. This hypothesis is based on our observation of an inverse correlation between PTEN expression and levels of NEDD9 gene expression in human melanoma samples. NEDD9 (neural precursor derived, developmentally downregulated gene 9) was previously identified by us as a target of a recurrent focal amplification, associated with acquisition of metastatic potential in the RAS-Ink/Arf model. We have shown that NEDD9 is up-regulated in 3550% of metastatic melanomas and enhances proliferation and invasion. First, we demonstrated that NEDD9 cooperated with PTEN loss in Ink4a/Arf-/- melanocytes to enhance cell proliferation, anchorage independent growth, and invasion in vitro. Additionally, when melanocytes were injected into nude mice either subcutaneously or intravenously, NEDD9 overexpression facilitated increased tumor growth and lung seeding, respectively. Further analysis showed that NEDD9 expression correlated with increased phosphorylation of ERK, SFKs (Src family kinases), AKT2, and STAT3. Of these pathways we have demonstrated through the use of small molecule inhibitors that both ERK and AKT2 signaling are required for the enhanced anchorage independent growth observed in NEDD9 overexpressing melanocytes. In addition, we generated a mouse model based on loss of PTEN and INK4A/ARF with or without NEDD9 upregulation. To do this, we generated a tet-inducible NEDD9 allele that carries a doxycycline-responsive, melanocyte-targeted NEDD9. These mice were crossed with a strain containing floxed PTEN and INK4A/ARF in combination with a melanocyte-targeted CreERT2. The development of cutaneous and ocular melanomas in these mice was enhanced by NEDD9 induction.

In order to understand the molecular correlates of PTEN expression in clinical specimens, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for PTEN in a CLIA-certified laboratory at the MD Anderson Cancer Center on a cohort of FFPE melanomas with mutational and proteomic data from frozen tissue from the same tumors. The expression of PTEN in the tumor tissue was compared to staining intensity in internal positive controls (i.e. endothelial cells), and was scored as Absent, Markedly Reduced, Mildly Reduced, or Normal/Increased. In a cohort of 93 tumors, Absent PTEN expression was observed in 21%, Markedly Reduced in 23%, Mildly Reduced in 36%, and Normal/Increased in 18%. PTEN expression was not evaluable in 1 tumor, and 2% of tumors showed clonality of PTEN expression in the tumors with distinct areas of Normal/Increased and Absent PTEN expression. Absent PTEN expression was detected in 38% of BRAF mutant, 0% of NRAS mutant, and 11% of Wild-type tumors. Quantitative proteomic data generated by reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis of the frozen tissue demonstrated that tumors with Absent PTEN by IHC had significantly lower PTEN (p<0.001), and higher levels of P-AKT Thr308 (p=0.004), P-AKT Ser473 (p=0.008) and P-P70S6K (p=0.01) than tumors with Reduced/Normal/Increased PTEN expression, consistent with increased activation of the downstream signaling by the PI3K-AKT pathway. In contrast, tumors with Markedly Reduced PTEN had lower levels of PTEN expression by RPPA than the Mildly Reduced and Normal/Increased PTEN tumors (p=0.046) but they did not exhibit significant differences in P-AKT or P-P70S6K. In light of these results, PTEN expression in subsequent samples was scored as Absent, Present, or Clonal. PTEN IHC of 323 distant metastases identified Absent PTEN expression in 18%, Clonal expression in 2%, and PTEN Present in 79% of resected stage IV melanomas. Among tumor sites with at least 15 samples available for analysis, the rate of Absent PTEN expression was relatively high in CNS (n=39; 28%) and intestinal metastases (n=76; 30%), but was lower in lung (n=147; 10%) and liver (n=18; 6%). Twenty six patients had tissue available from both CNS and extracranial metastases; the concordance rate of PTEN Absence in the paired specimens was 77%.

Distinguishing between benign and malignant pigmented lesions is difficult and often requires excision for pathological examination. In most malignant melanoma, an early genetic alteration of the melanocytes is a mutation of the BRAF oncogene. We have used a pre-clinical mouse model that allows conditional induction of the BRAF oncogene and deletion of Pten tumor suppressor in melanocytes. Upon induction, these animals develop melanomas that reproduce many of the histological and molecular changes observed in humans. With pump-probe imaging in vivo we have non-invasively detected the early modifications that harbor melanoma formation. We have investigated the sub-cellular expression of melanin as an indicator of tumor progression along with the morphological modifications that characterize the pigmented malignant lesions. Methods. Transgenic mice (Tyr', '', 'CreER(Tg/+); BRaf(CA), Pten(lox/lox)) were treated topically 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT', ' 1.5uL of 5mM) to induce conversion of BRaf(CA) to BrafV600E and Pten silencing (n=4). In vivo pump-probe microscopy was performed to acquire 3D, noninvasive images of the pigmented lesions, using the melanin pigment itself for imaging contrast. Images were acquired 2-day after 4-OHT application, at 2 and 4 weeks. C54 mice (n=2) were used as control. Pump-probe was combined with multiphoton autofluorescence. In vivo confocal microscopy was performed for morphological evaluation and blood flow detection. Afterwards, mice were euthanized, the skin was resected and sections were evaluated after staining with hematoxylin-eosin (HE). Results. Pigmented lesions were detectable by pump-probe microscopy two days after the treatment. The second scan (2-week) showed strong pigmentation present both, superficially and around the canal root of the hairs. The subsequent scan (4-week) showed the invasive nature of the lesions with altered cellular architecture resembling vertical growth melanomas. Pigmentation and atypical cellular proliferation was also present in the deeper layers of the dermis indicating the invasiveness of the tumor. These findings were confirmed by histological examination of the HE slides. In vivo confocal microscopy showed prominent convoluted vessels with large caliber and high blood flow confirming the malignant nature of the lesions. The control subjects did not show the cellular formations typical of the melanocytic lesions. Conclusions. Pump-probe laser microscopy detected in vivo and label-free the morphological changes that take place in melanoma formation. In contrast to the control subjects, melanocytic lesions were easily identifiable 2- day after the treatment with 4-OHT. This new non-invasive diagnostic approach is helpful in identifying early stage cutaneous melanomas.']",

        "Background":"[\"Although effective therapies exist for BRAF-mutant metastatic melanomas (MM) and ER+/PR+/HER2+ breast cancers, fewer options are available for the more aggressive triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) and Ras-mutant MM. Immune infiltration is frequently observed in patient subsets with MM or TNBC. An anti-tumor host immune response may be restrained by the expression of immune checkpoint proteins, such as the programmed death 1 (PD1) protein. We evaluated mDX400, a murine version of the anti-PD-1 antibody MK-3475 that is currently in human clinical trials, in genetically engineered murine models (GEMMs) of melanoma and breast cancer (BC). PD1 antibody was used alone and in combination. Models studied were for basal-like, TNBC (C3TAg), Claudin-Low breast cancer p53null, luminal BC (MMTV-Her2/Neu), RAS-driven melanoma (Tyr-H-Ras and null for Ink4a/Arf (TRIA)) and BRaf-mutant, Pten-deficient melanoma (BRaf/Pten). Mice were housed, treated, and evaluated in the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Mouse Phase I Unit (MP1U). mDX400 and isotype antibody (10mg/kg IP qw) were supplied by Merck & Co., Inc. Murine cohorts were assessed weekly and therapeutic intervention began once tumors reached 40-64mm3. TNBC models were treated with Carboplatin (C, 50mg/kg IP qwk) in combination with mDX400. mDX400 was administered as a single agent in Melanoma GEMMs. Endpoints were maximal response at 21 days and median overall survival (OS). In the C3TAg BC model, mDX400 did not exhibit single-agent activity, but substantial synergy was observed in combination with C [partial response (PR) or CR in 12 of 15 vs. 0 of 19 in non-treated animals, Fisher's exact p=0.006 or vs. C alone 5 of 13 animals, p=0.05] and prolonged OS (41 vs. 28 days in NT, log-rank p=0.006 or C only 28 days, p=0.006) in the C3TAg model. Treatment with single-agent mDX400 induced a marked response in the RAS-driven TRIA melanoma model that is resistant to multiple systemic treatments. mDX400-treated TRIA mice enjoyed an almost tripling of OS [median 56 vs. 21 days, p=0.006]. BRaf/Pten melanomas did not respond to mDX400. Likewise mDX400 plus C provided no benefit to the p53null or MMTV-Her2/Neu BC GEMMs vs. C alone. Our data show differential response of PD-1 antibody therapies to various melanoma and BC models, the latter in combination with C. The responsiveness of a RAS-driven melanoma model to mDX400 is consistent with earlier reports about the clinical benefit of patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma to Ipilimumab, and the lack of PD-L1 expression and immune infiltrates of PTEN-deficient melanomas. At the meeting we will report expression of PD-L1 and other immune checkpoint proteins by cancer cells. The basis whereby carboplatin potentiates the activity of anti-PD1 in TNBC is an area of ongoing study.\"]",

More importantly, the toxicity and financial burden of receiving such therapy warrants a personalized, or precision medicine, approach to appropriate selection of treatment, thus molecular predictors of response may become as important as biomarkers such as PDL1 expression. Recently the high mutational burden of malignant melanoma was shown to be related to the degree of response to the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab, but mutational burden alone was not sufficient to predict benefit1. Another study has shown NRAS-mutant had a trend to superior outcomes compared with other cohorts in terms of response to therapy with anti-PD1 antibodies and progression-free survival2. Moreover, insight into the molecular evolution of melanoma was recently established3, wherein somatic mutations in oncogenes such as BRAF, NRAS, GNAQ, or GNA11 occur early during progression and additional mutations of TERT, CDKN2A, TP53, and PTEN are seen in late-stage disease. To better evaluate the relationship of these mutations to immunotherapy response, our institution has profiled 95 patients with melanoma with next-generation sequencing (NGS). Of the 95 patients profiled, the most common mutations identified were BRAF (38%), NRAS (21%), TP53 (18%), PTEN (14%), TERT (9%), and CDKN2A (8%). We are presently conducting a retrospective analysis of these selected oncogenes as they relate to clinical responses, and intend to report disease outcomes (duration of response, progression free survival, and overall survival) as they relate to checkpoint inhibition.']",

The median age at biopsy or resection was 63 (25-83), 55% of the tissue came from liver, 16% from pancreas, 7% lung, 4% peritoneum, and 18% from another type of tissue. 87% of the patients were diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and the remaining with another form of confirmed or suspected pancreatic cancer.The most identified pathogenic mutations were KRAS (85%), TP53 (72%), CDKN2A (47%), CDKN2B (24%), SMAD4 (22%), ARID1A (10%), STK11 (7%), and BRCA2 (5%). The average number of genomic alterations (likely but not confirmed to be somatic) detected was five per patient from a panel of 320 genes. Molecular modifications that are linked to a treatment option were observed in 44% of patients. Twenty four of 144 patients (17%) had mutations in at least one DNA repair gene potentially benefiting from platinum or PARP inhibitor-based therapies, including BRCA2 (5%), ATM (4%), BAP1 (4%), SMARCA4 (3%), FANC (1%), CHEK2 (1%), and PALB2 (<1%). Other actionable molecular phenotypes observed include anti-HER2 therapies targeting ERBB2 amplifications (3%) and mTOR inhibitors suitable for patients with mutations in STK11/LKB1 (7%), PTEN (3.5%), PIK3R1 (<1%), or PIK3CA (3%). Actionable alterations identified with a low frequency (<2%) include RET fusions, amplifications of FGFR, CRKL, AXL, and mutations in NTRK3, MEN1 (PNET), and BRAF. One patient harbored the BRAF V600E mutation, prompting consideration of off label melanoma-approved therapy.

In humans, somatic mutation of BRAF, to encode the BRAFV600E oncoprotein, is an early predisposing event in melanoma initiation, but is insufficient to drive malignant melanomagenesis in the absence of additional cooperating events. We describe a genome-wide, forward genetic screen in mice restricted to pigment producing melanocytes as an unbiased approach to identify new candidate melanoma progression genes. By combining Sleeping Beauty (SB) with a Cre-activated BRafCA allele we observed frank melanomas with average latency of 36 weeks. By contrast, melanocyte specific expression of BRAFV600E elicited benign melanocytic nevi that failed to progress to malignant melanoma by one year of age.

Loss or inactivation of the tumor suppressor PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog on Chromosome Ten) is observed in 40-50% of melanoma, and BRAF and PTEN mutations exist coincidentally in approximately 20% of melanoma cases. In mouse GEMM models, these mutations cooperate to promote metastatic melanomagenesis. However, existing methods to activate these lesions with Tyr-CreERT2 and topical tamoxifen application yields multifocal primary tumors whose origins cannot be accurately determined. To improve this model, we combined a tdTomatoLSL allele that serves as a visual marker of Cre recombination with Tyr-CreERT2;BrafCA;Ptenlox/lox to produce an animal where we can reproducibly initiate tumorigenesis in a spatiotemporally controllable manner by transiently applying extremely low doses (<20 nM) of tamoxifen to the dermis of the ear. Due to melanocyte-specific expression of the fluorescent protein tdTomato, we can track tumor progression from endogenous cells using two-photon intravital imaging. Starting from a single primary tumor on the ear, we can detect distant metastases in cervical lymph nodes and lungs via macroscopic fluorescent imaging, qRT-PCR and histology. We are using this model in combination with targeted therapy to investigate the effects of selective molecular inhibitors on the growth and metastasis of endogenous BRAFV600E/PTEN-/- metastatic melanoma at the cellular level. Preliminary studies using intravital imaging and a selective MEK1/2 inhibitor, GSK212 (Trametinib, FDA approved treatment for metastatic melanoma) show that targeted therapy causes heterogeneous reorganization of the tumor cells as early as 3 days post-treatment. After several weeks of continuous treatment, the remaining, resistant tumor cells are highly correlated spatially with bundled collagen structures detected by second harmonic generation signal, suggesting that cellular milieu strongly influences drug response. In addition, GSK212 treated animals still had lung macro-metastatic tumors, indicating that despite continuous MEK1/2 inhibition, metastatic tumor growth in the lung was still possible. In summary, we have developed an inducible endogenous model of melanoma metastasis that can be used to directly investigate both heterogeneous effects of targeted therapy at the cellular level and the efficacy of targeted therapy against metastasis.']",

Arf6 is activated by various extracellular signals and oncogenic events and has been shown to promote cell migration and pro-invasive phenotype in human cancer cells. Small molecule inhibition of ARF6 reduces spontaneous metastasis in xenograft models of human cutaneous melanoma, suggesting that ARF6 is necessary for disease progression. Using a genetically-engineered mouse model of BRAF-mutant melanoma, we determined whether activation of Arf6 is sufficient to induce spontaneous metastasis in vivo. For melanocyte-specific primary tumor induction, Cre recombinase was delivered via local injection of RCAS virus into DCT-TVA;Cdkn2alox/lox;BRAFV600E mice. In the experimental mice, a constitutively active mutant form of Arf6 (Q67L) was virally delivered with Cre. In this study, we observed a significant increase in spontaneous metastatic disease burden in Arf6 Q67L mice. Likewise, tail vein injection of melanoma cell lines derived from Arf6 Q67L tumors consistently show a diffuse pattern of pulmonary metastasis compared to controls that show rare, microscopic metastasis. Recently, it has been demonstrated that activation of Akt, but not Pten loss, leads to an aggressive phenotype in melanoma that includes the acquisition of brain metastases. Immunohistochemical analysis of phospho-Akt revealed that Arf6 Q67L is sufficient to induce Akt activation in tumors. In addition, ARF6 is necessary for AKT activation in human melanoma lines. We did not observe brain metastasis in DCT-TVA;Cdkn2alox/lox;BRAFV600E + Arf6 Q67L mice. When we added Ptenlox/lox allele to this genetic background, however, we observed microscopic brain metastases at a low frequency, suggesting that the combination of Pten loss and Arf6 activation reaches a threshold level of Akt activation that is sufficient to cause brain metastasis. Taken together our data indicate that activation of Arf6 is sufficient to potentiate melanoma metastasis, consistent with the proinvasive cellular phenotype attributed to Arf6. In addition, our data suggests a novel signaling mechanism by which Arf6, a small GTPase involved in trafficking, is somehow involved in Akt activation and that this step may be important for the acquisition of metastatic capacity.']",

        "Background":"['The pathogenic mutations in melanoma have largely been catalogued, but the order of their occurrence is not known. We identified 82 cases of melanocytic neoplasia with two or more histopathologically distinct precursor and descendent portions. These portions spanned several histopathologic stages including benign nevi, intermediate neoplasms such as dysplastic nevi, melanoma in situ, invasive melanoma, and metastatic melanoma. In total, 277 histopathogically distinct areas were microdissected and sequenced using a panel of several hundred cancer-genes at an average of 275-fold coverage. In all cases precursor lesions harbored mutations known to activate the MAPK pathway, most commonly affecting BRAF or NRAS, and thus these were considered initiating mutations. TERT promoter mutations were the earliest secondary mutations to occur, emerging in intermediate neoplasms and in situ melanomas. Bi-allelic CDKN2A mutations and/or deletions arose predominantly at the transition to invasive melanoma. TP53 and PTEN mutations occurred comparatively later in thicker primary melanomas. In the 12 cases in which matched primaries and metastases were sequenced, no pathogenic mutations were specifically associated with the transition to metastatic melanoma, suggesting that metastatic capability was already present in the primary tumors. Unequivocally benign neoplasms, which mostly consisted of conventional nevi, disproportionately harbored BRAFV600E mutations as the only apparent pathogenic alteration. Lesions that were histopathologically intermediate, such as dysplastic nevi, had two or more pathogenic mutations and were enriched for NRAS mutations. These findings provide genetic support for the existence of an intermediate stage of melanocytic neoplasia, resolving a long-standing controversy. We also found that melanomas with different initiating mutations evolve through distinct evolutionary trajectories linked to specific histopathologic precursors. A mutational signature of UV-radiation-induced DNA damage predominated in lesions from all histopathologic stages, implicating UV-radiation in both the initiation and progression of melanoma. The point mutation burden increased steadily from one progression stage to the next, stabilizing once melanomas became invasive. By contrast, copy number alterations only became prevalent at the transition to invasive melanoma. Melanomas evolve from benign lesions linearly, whereas, they show patterns of branched evolution when they evolve from intermediate lesions; this indicates that evolution may accelerate once a melanocytic neoplasm reaches an intermediate stage. In summary, our study outlines a framework of the genetic evolution of melanocytic neoplasms from precursor lesions and unveils the rate-limiting homeostatic factors that become disrupted as neoplasms progress from one stage to the next, as well as the pathogenic factors driving this evolution.']",

Melanoma has been the tumor of choice for the evaluation of a wide variety of therapeutic approaches that rely on stimulation of the immune system to combat cancer. The striking responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors noted in some melanoma patients have now been observed in several other malignancies, including renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. These findings are very encouraging, however the specific mechanisms of response and reasons why only a subset of patients respond to therapy are not known. The extraordinary potential of immune therapies in cancer suggests that human-relevant mouse models of cancer are required to understand mechanisms of response and to optimize therapy so that a larger proportion of patients respond.We have generated and evaluated a series of genetically engineered mouse models driven by alterations in Braf, Pten, Cdkn2a, beta catenin, p53, and Nras that reflect the genetic diversity of the vast majority of human melanoma. We have backcrossed 6 of these models to C57Bl/6, generated tumors, and isolated a series of over 20 congenic mouse melanoma cell lines. Several independent lines have been isolated for each melanoma genotype generated. Injection of these lines into C57Bl/6J mice results in reproducible tumor formation in the absence of co-injection of Matrigel. We are in the process of characterizing the tumor microenvironment in each of the models using flow cytometry and a novel quantitative imaging approach of histological sections, which produces flow cytometry-like data, but retains spatial and morphologic information that can be utilized to characterize much smaller tumors. This series of congenic lines represents an ideal set of models for the study of cancer immunology and responses to immune therapies.']",

Extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of this novel scaffold showed that the best analog in this series, ABI-231, has an average IC50 = 5.2 nM against panels of melanoma and prostate cancer cell lines, is orally bioavailable, and strongly suppress melanoma tumors in vivo. Analyses of the potential binding pose of ABI-231 at the colchicine binding pocket suggested small substitutions to the indole moiety in ABI-231 could further increase its interactions to tubulin.Based this hypothesis, we have established an efficient synthetic method for the synthesis of ABI-231 analogs by either rotating the indole ring or introducing substituents on the indole of ABI-231. Using this method, we synthesized and tested 27 analogs of ABI-231. Several of the compounds show excellent potency against a panel of melanoma cancer cell lines with a diverse genomic background (mutations in BRAF, TP53, CDKN2A and PTEN) that are frequently encountered in clinical metastatic melanoma tumors. Additionally, they are not substrates for the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) efflux pump and therefore strongly inhibited the multidrug resistant cell lines. The potency of the compounds was further verified by their potent growth inhibition of cancer cell colonies. Results from cell cycle analysis, apoptosis evaluation and tubulin polymerization inhibition are consistent with their expected mechanisms of action. Potential off-target analyses performed by Eurofins Cerep-Panlabs SafetyScreen 44 indicated that they are clean and does not inihibt any of the tested off-targets at 100 fold of its IC50 value in melanoma cells, suggesting the good safety profile for this compound and the probably these scaffold in general.

Studies from our laboratory showed its chemopreventive effects in a UVB-induced skin cancer model, as well as in vitro pro-apoptotic effects in A431 squamous cancer cells, UACC-62 and SKMEL-2 human melanoma cell lines. In this study, the antineoplastic effects of honokiol were evaluated in vivo against the malignant melanoma cell lines UACC-62 that harbors mutated BRAF, CDK4i, PTEN and SKMEL-2 cells that presents NRAF, and TP53 mutated genes.The present study investigated the mechanism of honokiol-induced antitumoral effects in human melanoma UACC-62 and SKMEL-2 cells in two xenograft melanoma models in mice.UACC-62 and SKMEL-2 melanoma cells were subcutaneously grafted in nude mice, treatment groups received honokiol 50 mg/kg thrice a week and tumor growth was followed. After five to seven weeks, animals were euthanized and tumor tissue collected for gene profiling and western blots. The genetic expression of apoptotic biomarkers was assessed by qRT-PCR by using PCR arrays for the apoptotic pathway (SABiosciences, CA).After subcutaneous grafting of UACC-62 or SKMEL-2 human melanoma cells in the nude mice, the intraperitoneal administration of honokiol at 50 mg/kg body weight for five to seven weeks caused a significant reduction of tumor growth. Honokiol activated the apoptotic pathway in UACC-62 cells xenograft tumors in mice, as attested by the significant up-regulation of BAK1, BAX, CARD8, CASP10, CASP2, CASP6, CASP7, FADD, TNFRSF10B, TNFRSF25, TP53 and TP53BP2 transcripts. In the western blots from the UACC-62 cells tumors, there was an increase in the expression of CASP3, CASP7, CASP8, CASP6, cleaved CASP6 and CASP10 proteins in the honokiol treated group. In the tumors originated from the SKMEL-2 melanoma cells, a significant up-regulation of BAD, BAK1, BAX, NOD1, CARD6, CASP7, FADD, TNFRSF21 and TRAF3 transcripts was observed.

        "Background":"['T cell-mediated immunotherapies are promising cancer treatments. However, most patients still fail to respond to these therapies. The molecular determinants of immune resistance are poorly understood. Here, we interrogated the role of loss of expression of the tumor suppressor, PTEN, in immune resistance.In preclinical studies, we found that silencing PTEN in tumor cells inhibited T cell-mediated tumor killing and decreased T cell trafficking into tumors. In clinical studies, we observed that tumors with loss of PTEN had significantly less CD8+ T cell infiltration than PTEN-present tumors. In addition, 26% of melanomas that did not yield successful TIL growth demonstrated PTEN loss, which was more frequent than was observed in tumors that yielded successful TIL growth (11%). We further validated the association between reduced number and impaired function of TIL with PTEN loss using another independent cohort, TCGA dataset for SKCM. More importantly, we analyzed clinical outcomes of metastatic melanoma patients treated with the FDA-approved anti-PD-1 antibodies. Our analysis demonstrates that a greater reduction in tumor burden was achieved by PD-1 blockade in PTEN present patients, when compared with PTEN absent patients.To decipher the factors mediating the immunosuppressive effects of PTEN loss, we determined the expression profiles of tumor cells with or without PTEN expression. Our results indicated that PTEN loss increased the production of immunosuppressive factors, including CCL2 and VEGF. Anti-VEGF blocking antibody improved anti-tumor activity of transferred tumor-reactive T cells and enhanced tumor infiltration of transferred T cells in PTEN-silenced tumors. These results suggest that loss of PTEN can facilitate the resistance of T cell-mediated immune responses by increasing the expression of immunosuppressive factors.Given that PTEN loss results in activation of the PI3K pathway, we evaluated the efficacy of immunotherapy in combination with a selective PI3Kinhibitor to treat spontaneously developed BRAF mutant, PTEN null melanomas in genetically engineered mouse models. Our result showed that the combination of PI3K inhibitor and anti-PD-1 significantly delayed tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Mice treated with this combination had a median survival time of 28 days, which is longer than the survival time of mice treated with either therapy. Increased numbers of T cells at tumor sites were found in mice receiving the combination therapy compared with mice receiving either agent alone.Taken together, our results demonstrate that PTEN loss contributes to the generation of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Notably, this study provides the first direct clinical evidence to support the association between PTEN loss and poor clinical outcome in immunotherapy treated patients. In addition, our study indicates that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway can improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer.']",

Complex feedback loops and crosstalk between the MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR pathways, thus molecular predictors of sensitivity/resistance and synergistic/antagonistic interactions are urgently needed for the effective clinical development of combination strategies. Here we hypothesize that PTEN status critically modulates the growth inhibitory activity of single and combined MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition. Methods. Molecular and functional effects of single and combined MEK (trametinib, T) and mTOR (everolimus, E) blockade were assessed in a panel of 29 cancer cell lines with different molecular drivers. Pharmacologic interactions were analyzed by conservative isobologram analysis. PTEN role was mechanistically assessed by either silencing PTEN expression by shRNA or overexpressing a functional PTEN protein by stable transfection. Specific proteins and their phosphorylation states were analyzed using Kinexus Antibody Microarrays. Results. In the cell line panel analyzed, the presence of a wt-PTEN was the only significant predictor of sensitivity to T (p=0.001), while BRAF mutations were significantly related to E resistance (p=0.015). PTEN silencing slightly increased resistance to T in the wt-PTEN melanoma cell line M14; conversely, wt-PTEN overexpression in the PTEN-del WM115 cell line, dramatically increased sensitivity to T. E-induced growth inhibition was not significantly affected. Combined MEK and mTOR inhibition resulted in a striking growth inhibitory synergism in cells lacking PTEN expression (CI', ' 0.4-0.0005), but not in those with an intact PTEN (CI', ' 1.2-107; p=0.001). However, PTEN silencing restored growth inhibitory synergism of combined T and E in M14 cells (CI', '0.36); similarly, the slope of the CI/fraction affected curve was dramatically altered in PTEN-overexpressing WM115 cells, as compared to their control-transfected counterpart, again indicating that PTEN expression/function causally influences functional response to combined MEK and mTOR inhibition. Similar results in terms of synergistic/antagonistic pharmacologic interactions were obtained when either double PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitors (PF-5212384) or AKT allosteric inhibitors (MK-2206) were used to block the PI3K/mTOR pathway in combination with T. Proteomic analysis indicated that a greater modification of protein expression/phosphorylation profiles in response to MEK or combined MEK/mTOR inhibition occurs in cells lacking a functional PTEN, as compared to the wt-PTEN-expressing ones; preliminary analysis suggests that AKT phosphorylation and NF-B activation maybe be crucial mediators of synergistic growth-inhibitory interactions occurring with combined treatment.

        "Background":"['Driver somatic mutations confer a selective growth advantage to tumors while passenger mutations do not. Genes carrying driver mutations are detected in whole-exome sequencing (WES) studies if their non-synonymous mutations are significantly more frequent than their silent mutations, adjusting for the heterogeneous mutation rates across genomic locations, subjects and mutation types. Typical tumor WES studies (100-300 tumor samples) lack statistical power, and thus can identify only small numbers of candidate driver genes and possibly miss the well-established ones. The best algorithm to detect driver genes to date is MutSigCV. For each target gene, MutSigCV identifies its bagel, a set of genes predicted to have similar background mutation rates to the target gene and use the bagels to estimate the background mutation rate. Based on the identified bagels, we developed a novel statistical method implementing a series of algorithms to improve the statistical power while maintaining the type-I error rate. First, we developed a statistical framework for testing the selective growth advantage of each mutation type and appropriately integrating evidence of growth advantage across mutation types to achieve robust power. We then extended the algorithm to consider spatial clustering information. This substantially improves the statistical power when non-silent mutations are clustered into a few short regions or nucleotides. We applied this novel method to TCGA melanoma WES including 271 tumor samples. Without modeling spatial clustering information, over 30 candidate driver genes, including BRAF, NRAS, PTEN, TP53, PPP6C and CDKN2A were detected controlling FDR=0.01. Modeling spatial information of somatic mutations detected additional rarely mutated genes, including DISP1 (P=1.310-20, involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation that leads to normal development of embryonic structures), IDH1 (P=1.010-8, previously identified in relation to gliobalstoma and acute myeloid leukemia), MAP2K1 (P=510-18, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinases that also include BRAF, MEK and other important players in melanoma), INTS8 (P=7.710-15, an integrator of small nuclear RNA processing), and STK19 (P=1.210-10, encoding a serine/threonine kinase, previously identified in melanoma).

        "Background":"['Background', ' Combination treatment of two recent trends in cancer therapy, namely immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors and drugs that target specific gene mutations, could improve cancer survivorship overall. Targeted drugs usually induce rapid tumor death leading to the release of neoantigens, and can affect immune development pathways, which could increase the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor treatment. Assessment of somatic mutation profiles from large public databases provides an estimate of the prevalence of targetable somatic mutations and the burden of somatic nonsynonymous mutations (NsM), used as a surrogate for overall neoantigen load, which, in turn, correlates with clinical utility of checkpoint inhibitors for melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma. The rational design of these combinations based on somatic genomic profiles offers a prioritization scheme for new clinical trials. Methods', ' We surveyed 13,349 genomic profiles from public databases for cases with specific mutations targeted by current agents and/or a burden of exome-wide non-synonymous mutations (NsM) that exceeds a recently suggested threshold for response to checkpoint inhibitors. Results', ' Overall, 8.9% of cases have profiles that could benefit from combination therapy, which corresponds to approximately 11.2% of US annual incident cancer cases; the most commonly targetable mutations were observed in PIK3CA, BRAF, NF1, NRAS, and PTEN genes. Interestingly, cases with mutations in SMO, DDR2, FGFR1, PTCH1, FGFR2, and/or MET appear to be enriched in those with high burdens of NsM, who have a higher likelihood of responding to immunotherapy. Of the 13,349 cases that could benefit from combination therapy, 50.9% had BRAF, NF1, GNAQ and/or GNA11 mutations which can be targeted by Trametinib; 26.1% by Taselisib (targets PIK3CA mutations); and 19.8% by Afatinib (EGFR and ERBB2 mutations).

        "Background":"['Acquired drug resistance is a long-standing problem of cancer therapeutics. The issue has become even more vexing with the development of highly selective agents; resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib is acquired frequently in lung adenocarcinomas. Thus, anticipating acquired resistance and understanding its basis may help us develop strategies to prevent or circumvent occurrence. Through its receptor tyrosine kinase Met, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) regulates mitogenesis, motogenesis, and morphogenesis during development and adulthood. HGF/Met signaling also contributes to cancer progression in many malignancies, including glioblastoma. Rilotumumab is a fully human neutralizing monoclonal antibody against HGF tested in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials, including mono therapy in renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma, as well as combination trials in gastric, colorectal, small cell lung cancers and castrate resistant prostate cancer.To generate a cellular model of acquired resistance to rilotumumab, an HGF/Met dependent human glioblastoma-derived cell line (U87-MG) was grown in rilotumumab (600 nM) for 120 days. Growth rate, HGF secretion, Met content and Met activation state were 10-fold, 10,000-fold, 10-fold and 80-fold higher than the parental cell values, respectively. The HGF and MET coding sequences were normal in both parental and resistant cells. Quantitative PCR studies to determine mRNA levels of all HGF isoforms revealed a dramatic increase in full-length HGF transcript. CGH array studies indicated amplification within both HGF and MET genes. Xenograft studies confirmed that tumor growth was resistant to rilotumumab, however the resistant cell line and tumors remained sensitive to a highly selective Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suggesting that resistance was achieved via increased HGF/Met signaling rather than mutation or activation of alternate pathways. Microarray expression analysis demonstrated transcript profiles that were consistent with HGF/Met pathway activation. Thus the molecular basis of acquired resistance in this model differs from those prevalent in', ' [1] lung cancers treated with EGFR inhibitors and medulloblastomas treated with hedgehog inhibitors, where most cases acquire secondary mutations in the targeted kinase; [2] breast cancers treated with HER2 inhibitors, where PTEN loss, p27 downregulation, and activation of other receptors are primary causes; or [3] malignant melanoma treated with BRAF inhibitors, where increased signaling via multiple pathways lead to PI3K- and/or MEK-mediated reactivation of the MAPK pathway. In addition to the importance of HGF/Met pathway activity in selecting glioblastoma patients for HGF-targeted therapeutics, our results suggest that monitoring Met pathway activity could provide early indications of acquired resistance to these agents, and that Met kinase inhibitors may still be efficacious when resistance occurs.']",

        "Background":"[\"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer in the United States. Although chemotherapy, radiation and targeted therapies can improve survival rates, recent studies have shown the potential benefit of immunotherapies to improve outcomes for patients with advanced CRC. Targeted therapies that use monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to EGFR have been shown to benefit some CRC patients. Until recently, KRAS has been the only predictive biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy for metastatic CRC. However, 40% to 60% of patients with wild-type KRAS do not respond to anti-EGFR therapy. Therefore, to accurately predict patients response to treatments and improve clinical outcomes, additional prediction and treatment methods are imperative. One of the many efforts to improve prediction for CRC patient's response to the anti-EGFR therapy is the development of gene expression based RAS signature scores for identification of RAS activated tumors independent of mutations in the KRAS gene. Recently there have been major advances in immunotherapeutic approaches in a wide variety of cancers. In solid tumors such as melanoma and colon cancers, immune checkpoints have been shown to improve clinical outcomes. There is considerable effort being placed on combinations of targeted therapy and immunotherapies to improve responses for these cancers. Similarly, since no single treatment can apply to all CRC patients, we aim to stratify patients using a combination of three methods\", ' 1. RAS signature score based on the expression profile of 18 genes. This RAS signature score enables measurements of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) pathway functional output independent of tumor genotype. 2. Expression profile of immune checkpoint inhibitor target genes, such as PD1 and PDL1, and 3. In-silico prediction of neo-antigens and peptide binding affinity between tumor antigens derived from mutations and human HLA alleles.55 FFPE samples were selected from a cohort of 468 samples with matching FF samples. These 55 samples have about 1', '1', '1 ratio of high, medium and low RAS scores. Here we showed our ability to obtain RAS signature scores with concordant results using different platforms including RNA-seq, targeted RNA-seq, Nanostring and Affymetrix microarray. Samples that have RAS activating mutations such as KRAS and BRAF have significant higher RAS scores (p<0.001). Interestingly, expression of PD-L1 was significantly lower in tumor samples harboring mutations of genes such as MET, PTEN, NRAS, FBXW7, and GNAS. Kruskal-Wallis test showed that the expression of PD-L1 was significantly lower in samples with higher RAS signature scores (p<0.05). Combined with further prediction of tumor antigen derived from genes with missense mutations, we provide a combinatorial method for stratifying metastatic CRC patients.']",

        "Background":"['Background', \" Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are rare tumor cells shed from a patient's tumors into the circulation. It has been hypothesized that CTCs could be used as a liquid biopsy to obtain repeat molecular characterizations and provide dynamic insight into the biology of an underlying cancer. However, due to the low abundance of CTCs and technical limitations in the single-cell sequencing, it had been very difficult to characterize CTCs on a whole genome scale. The surrogacy of CTCs for conventional tumor tissues has never been demonstrated beyond targeted genomic alterations such as shared ETS fusions in prostate cancer (PC), EGFR mutations in lung cancer and BRAF mutations in melanoma. With recent technical advances in single-cell sequencing and single-CTC isolation technologies, we present the first study using whole genome sequencing (WGS) of isolated serially-collected single CTCs in a PC patient.Method\", ' By combining NanoVelcro CTC Chip with laser microdissection, we developed a robust platform for single-CTC isolation. Subsequent WGS was performed after the multiple displacement amplification of our single-CTC DNA. From a PC patient, we performed WGS on four of his CTCs on two different time point, his primary prostatectomy tissue and liver metastasis along with WBC and normal adjacent tissue from the prostatectomy as controls. Copy number variations, single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and structural variations (SVs), including rearrangements were identified for comparison.Results', ' We successfully performed WGS on isolated single CTCs, achieving 30X depth and >95% coverage. SNV analysis reveals that 33.5% (289/863) of founder somatic mutations (defined as mutations shared between primary and metastatic tumors) can be found in CTCs. Looking into the mutational landscape of CTCs, 48% of the CTC mutations can be traced back to either primary or metastatic tumor. Per SV analysis, we found and validated an intrachromosomal rearrangement in chr3 and an interchromosomal rearrangement between chr13 and chr15. These rearrangements are shared between both tumor tissues and most of the CTCs, but not discovered in WBC and normal adjacent tissue. At the same time, highly heterogeneous short SVs were discovered in PTEN, RB1 and BRCA2 in all tumor samples, suggesting a continuous evolution of SVs in these important tumor suppressor genes.Conclusion', ' Based on our capability to obtain high-quality WGS from single-CTCs, we validate the genomic surrogacy of CTCs by the detection of shared SNVs and rearrangements between CTCs and tumor tissues. The heterogeneous mutational landscapes of SNVs and SVs are also discovered in single-CTCs, indicating the value of our single-CTC WGS approach. We envision our single-CTC WGS approach will be utilized for studying tumor heterogeneity and the biological evolution of cancer during disease progression, even during anticancer therapy.']",
