To explore the involvements of IDH1/2 in the pathogenesis in pediatric hematological malignancies. We analyzed mutations that involve the activation sites of IDH1/2 using polymerase chain reaction amplification/sequencing in a total of 244 samples of pediatric myeloid malignancies as well as infantile leukemia including 17 AML-derived cell lines, 115 primary cases of AML, 28 primary cases of MDS, 15 primary cases of juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), 6 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-derived cell line, 18 primary cases of CML and 45 infantile leukemia(6 AML and 39 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients). Moreover, to assess whetherIDH1/2 mutations overlap with known gene abnormalities, such as FLT3, c-KIT, and NPM1 mutations, mutational analyses of FLT3, c-KIT, and NPM1 were also performed. The common IDH2 R140Q mutation was detected in a single AML case, whereas no IDH1 mutation was detected in samples of myeloid malignancies. Although no IDH2 mutation was detected in infantile leukemias, novel P127S, H133I and I130V of IDH1 mutations were detected in 4 of 45 (8.9%) infantile ALL cases. No IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were detected in the JMML, MDS, or CML samples examined. Six AML samples including one cell line had c-KIT mutations (D816V, N822K, or D419fs), 12 AML cases had FLT3-ITD and 10 infantile leukemia cases had FLT3 mutations (D835E or I836). The NPM1 mutation was detected in 2 of 132 AML samples. The AML case harboring the IDH2 mutation, Case 39 was a 12-year-old boy diagnosed as AML-M2 according to the French-American-British cooperative group classification system having t(8;21)(q22;q22), showed no abnormalities of NPM1, c-KIT, and FLT3. Remarkably, among 4 infantile ALL cases with IDH1 mutations, 3 cases showed mixed lineage leukemia(MLL) rearrangements with t(4;11). The FLT3-D835 mutation was found in 1 of 4 patients with IDH1 mutations. These results suggest that although the involvements of IDH1/2 mutations in the pathogenesis of pediatric myeloid malignancies are extremely rare, closely positioned to near activation site, R132 IDH1, these IDH1 mutations are the candidate second genetic events in a subset of MLL-leukemia.']",

We have previously shown that increased HIF-1 expression in NK-AML samples predicted for poor clinical outcome (Deeb et al Leukemia Research Dec 2010 Epub). Here we examined the IDH1 and IDH2 mutational status of 81 adult NK-AML marrow samples previously characterized for expression of HIF-1 and its downstream target VEGF-A.  Methods', '  Genomic DNA was extracted from marrow mononuclear cells from diagnostic AML samples. High-throughput DNA sequence analysis (PyroMark Q24 Pyrosequencer, Qiagen) performed with custom-designed primers for IDH1 R132 and IDH2 R140 and R172 mutations was used. HIF-1 and VEGF-A expression in AML cells was determined by immunohistochemistry (see Deeb et al, Leukemia Research online 2010) and RQ-PCR analysis.  Results', '  Among these 81 NK-AML samples, 6 (7.4%) contained IDH1-mutations, most in R132H (n=4). Eleven samples (13.6%) contained IDH2-mutations, all in R140Q. IDH1-mutated AML samples expressed higher mean  SEM levels of HIF-1 (3018% vs. 102.7%) and VEGF-A (6214 vs. 283.5%) protein expression and higher HIF-1 gene (6.93.5 vs. 4.00.5 fold) expression than IDH1 wildtype samples. In contrast, IDH2-mutated AML samples expressed no detectable HIF-1 protein and lower VEGF-A protein and HIF-1 gene levels than IDH2 wildtype samples. No differences in age, survival, presenting white blood cell count, or marrow blasts was noted based on IDH1/2 status.  Conclusions', '  Our data suggest a potential association between IDH1 mutations and higher HIF-1 and VEGF-A protein expression in AML cells as compared with IDH1 wild-type cells.

        "Background":"['Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 are frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), glioma, and many other cancers. While wild-type IDHs convert isocitrate to -ketoglutarate (-KG), mutant IDHs convert -KG to oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which dysregulates a set of -KG-dependent dioxygenases, such as TETs, histone demethylases, EGLNs, and other enzymes. Because the role of mutant IDH is not necessary for normal cells, inhibitors directed against mutant IDH are expected to have minimum side effects as those of anti-cancer agents.We established a mouse AML model harboring IDH mutations by co-transducing four mutant genes that frequently occur simultaneously in human AML patients. Conditional deletion of the IDH mutant blocked 2HG production and maintenance of leukemia stem cells, resulting in survival of the AML mice. These results indicate that the IDH mutations are critical for the development and maintenance of AML stem cells.Based on these findings, we developed potent and specific inhibitors of mutant IDH1 and tested their effects on the mutant IDH1-dependent AML mouse model, created by introducing four mutant genes including mutant IDH1. The 2HG level was promptly and dramatically decreased in AML cells soon after treatment with the mutant IDH1 inhibitors, and the number of leukemia cells was reduced after a 4-week treatment.To test the effect of the mutant IDH1 inhibitor on glioblastoma, we have established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of glioblastoma carrying IDH1 mutation, and tested the effect of the mutant IDH1 inhibitor on this model. The inhibitor reduced 2HG levels in tumors as well as in plasma. The inhibitor prevented the growth of the tumors with IDH1 mutation. On the other hand, the inhibitor did not affect the growth of the glioblastoma with wild type IDH1. Gene expression analysis identified a set of genes, of which expressions is changed by the IDH1 inhibitor. The most strongly upregulated gene is Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is a differentiation marker for astrocytes. Up-regulation of GFAP is confirmed by immune-staining and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. These results suggest that IDH inhibitor induces differentiation of the glioblastoma with IDH1 mutation. We have found that the glioblastoma is transplantable in mouse brain. We are now looking at effects of the inhibitor on this model.Taken together, the results indicate that IDH1 mutant inhibitors are effective for the treatment for AML as well as glioblastoma with IDH1 mutations.']",

IDH mutations have been associated with a globally hypermethylated genomic state, as the result of increased levels of 2-HG, a regulator of histone methylation. We sought to retrospectively determine responses of patients with IDH-mutated AML to treatment with hypomethylating agents.  Methods', '  We reviewed clinical data for AML patients treated at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from June 2001 to December 2011 whose stored leukemia samples from bone marrow aspirateshad been tested retrospectively for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations.

We selected patients who had been treated with the hypomethylating agents 5-azacitidine or decitabine, alone or in conjunction with other therapeutics. We retrospectively reviewed the patients medical records to obtain demographic, laboratory, treatment, and clinical data. We evaluated response measured by remission status, reduction in bone marrow blasts and peripheral blood blasts, and time to relapse.  Results', '  We identified 104 patients (25.6%) who had either an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation, and of these, 8 patients had also been treated with hypomethylating agents.

Of these 9 patients, three had a durable complete remission without recovery of blood counts (CRp), three had a partial response (PR), with or without blood count recovery, and three had no response. All 9 patients did have an initial decrease in the percentage of bone marrow blasts, peripheral blood blasts, or both.

IDH1 and IDH2 normally function to convert isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate. However, when these enzymes are mutated at select residues the mutant enzymes now convert -KG into 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). In normal cells, 2-HG levels are typically extremely low, but IDH1/2 mutant cells can accumulate up to 10 mM 2-HG. In an effort to counteract the neomorphic activity of mutant IDH enzymes, we identified and developed potent inhibitors of IDH1. The compounds inhibit IDH1 catalytic activity in biochemical assays and reduce 2-HG production in IDH1-mutant cell lines. Consistent with the fact that 2-HG inhibits -KG dependent enzymes including histone demethylases and Tet family hydroxylases, these IDH1 inhibitors induce a decrease in several histone methylation marks and also DNA methylation.

Importantly, many clinical studies demonstrated that IDH1/2 mutations are systematically conserved at relapse, suggesting that this mutated enzyme could contribute to early leukemogenesis.In an effort to identify therapy specifically targeting IDH1 R132H mutated blasts, we developed an AML cell line model carrying IDH1 R132H mutation. We first stably transduced HL60 cell line to establish clones carrying either empty vector, IDH1 WT gene or IDH1-R132H mutated gene. We then characterized these clones with different features including 2-HG production.Since demethylation of many genes involved in the retinol metabolism is impaired by IDH1-R132H mutation and because all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a retinol metabolite, is already used in clinic, we studied its effects on IDH1-R132H mutated AML cells.Here, we showed on our transduced models as well as on primary AML patient samples (n=6), that AML blasts harboring IDH1-R132H mutation were highly sensitive to low doses of ATRA, compared to the IDH1 WT. In fact, IDH1-R132H mutation sensitized to ATRA-induced differentiation, as shown by increased expression of the differentiation marker CD11b and morphological changes evidenced with May-Grnwald-Giemsa staining. This was followed by changes of CD14 and CD15 expression, as well as granulocytic enzymatic activity measured with the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assay. This terminal granulocytic differentiation came with the reduction of proliferation and colony formation, and then, quickly led to apoptosis of IDH1 R132H mutated AML cells.Moreover, we showed that the level of differentiation of IDH1 R132H mutated models was correlated to the magnitude of IDH1-R132H protein expression and thus to the 2-HG production. We further demonstrated that treatment with a cell-permeable form of 2-HG sensitized empty construct to ATRA-induced differentiation, whereas the inhibition of IDH1-R132H activity reduced its ATRA-sensitivity in IDH1-R132H mutant.Altogether, our results show that IDH1-R132H mutation sensitizes to ATRA-induced granulocytic terminal differentiation in a 2-HG concentration-dependent manner and that it leads to their apoptosis. Since serum 2-HG concentration of IDH mutated patients is approximately 100 fold higher than for non mutated patient, we could expect a high and specific effect of ATRA treatment on IDH1 mutated AML patients. Furthermore, as this mutation could contribute to relapse, this might be a promising therapeutic strategy to achieve a long-term remission in AML with IDH1 mutations.']",

To further understand the role of IDH mutations in cancer, we conducted mechanistic studies in the TF-1 IDH2 R140Q erythroleukemia model system and found that IDH2 mutant expression caused both histone and genomic DNA methylation changes that can be reversed when IDH2 mutant activity is inhibited. Specifically, histone hypermethylation is rapidly reversed within days whereas reversal of DNA hypermethylation proceeds in a progressive manner over the course of weeks. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed several pathways involved in tumorigenesis of leukemia and lymphoma, indicating a selective modulation of relevant cancer genes by IDH mutations. As methylation of DNA and histones is closely linked to mRNA expression and differentiation, these results indicate that IDH2 mutant inhibition may function as a cancer therapy via histone and DNA demethylation at genes involved in differentiation and tumorigenesis.']",

Our in silico analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data combined with wet-bench analysis of tumor extracts indicate that non-mutated IDH1 mRNA and protein is commonly overexpressed in primary GBM. We show that genetic and pharmacologic inactivation of IDH1 decreases GBM cell growth, promotes a more differentiated tumor cell state, increases apoptosis in response to targeted therapies, and prolongs survival of animal subjects bearing patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). On molecular levels, diminished IDH1 activity results in reduced -KG and NADPH production, which is paralleled by deficient metabolic flux from glucose or acetate into lipids, exhaustion of reduced glutathione, increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and enhanced histone methylation and differentiation marker expression.

        "Background":"['MIR142 mutations have been identified in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-Hodgkins lymphoma. In AML, all MIR142 mutations localize to the miR-142-3p seed sequence. We show that mutated MIR142 is unable to suppress several well-known targets of miR-142-3p. Interestingly, the mutations of miR-142-3p result in their preferential loading into the RNA-induced silencing complex, leading to the degradation of miR-142-5p. Accordingly, miR-142-5p expression is decreased in MIR142 mutated AML. Hence, MIR142 mutations in AML disrupt both miR-142-3p/5p functions. Thus, we modeled the effect of MIR142 mutations on hematopoiesis using Mir142-/- mice. We show that loss of miR142 results in significant increases in myeloid hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), including granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, myeloid-biased multipotent progenitors (CD150- CD48+ Flk2- Kit+ Sca+ lineage-) and CD229- myeloid-biased HSCs (CD150+ CD48- Kit+ Sca+ lineage-). In contrast, there are significant decreases of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors and erythroid precursors. Although the number of HSCs is normal in Mir142-/- mice, HSC transplantation suggest that they are myeloid-biased. In AML, MIR142 mutations are commonly found in conjunction with mutations of IDH1/2. To assess the importance of this association, we transduced wildtype or Mir142-/- HSPCs with retrovirus expressing IDH2 R172K and then transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients. Expression of IDH2 R172K alone was sufficient to induce a lethal myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). In contrast, Mir142-/- alone did not result in MPN. However, loss of Mir142 cooperates with IDH2 R172K to produce a more severe MPN, with increased CD34+ blasts and more severe anemia. Moreover, secondary transplantation shows that Mir142-/- x IDH2 R172K cells but not IDH2 R172K cells efficiently engraft and induce MPN, suggesting that loss of miR142 increases leukemia-initiating activity. We identify the histone methyltransferase ASH1L as a target gene of miR142 that contributes to altered hematopoiesis in Mir142-/- mice. The 3’-untranslated region of ASH1L has four miR-142-3p binding sites, and luciferase reporter assay shows that miR142 suppresses its translation by 80%. Consistent with this observation, Ashl1 protein expression is 3-fold higher in Mir142-/- bone marrow. ASH1L is a key positive regulator of HOX gene expression. Accordingly, we observed markedly (5-10 fold) increased HoxA9/A10 expression in myeloid progenitors in Mir142-/- mice. Likewise, HoxA9/A10 expression is increased in CD34+ blasts from Mir142-/- x IDH2 R172K transplanted mice. Of note, increased HoxA9 expression has been shown to cooperate with mutant IDH1 to induce AML in mice. Together, these findings support a model in which loss-of-function mutations of MIR142 contribute to hematopoietic malignancies by derepressing ASH1L and inducing HOXA9/10 gene expression.']",

The prognosis of AML is variable, likely reflecting its diversity at a genetic level. The pathogenesis of AML has not been completely defined; however it is clear that recurrent chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., translocations and numeric abnormalities) and genetic events (e.g., point mutations and indels) are necessary for disease development. Genetic changes are diverse and consist of large genomic changes such as rearrangements and ploidy anomalies, as well as submicroscopic changes, including point mutations and indels. Few studies have correlated cytogenetically detected anomalies with molecularly detected mutations in AML. Here we describe our experience using a hematological next generation sequencing (heme-NGS) panel in conjunction with conventional cytogenetic studies to interrogate diagnostic AML specimens in a routine clinical setting. Next generation sequencing was done using a custom designed amplicon panel and Illumina TruSeq Custom Amplicon (TSCA) capture. Using a customized bioinformatics pipelines we were able to detect single nucleotide variants (SNV) and small insertion/deletion (indel) to a lower limit of 5% with 100% sensitivity and specificity. 28 genes recurrently mutated in myeloid malignancies were examined including targeted regions of NPM1, FLT3, KIT, PTPN11, NRAS, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, DNMT3a, EZH2, PTEN, CEBPA, TP53, WT1, RUNX1, TET2, ATM, BRAF, CBL, MPL, SF3B1, ASXL1, HRAS, KRAS, PHF6, GNAS, ETV6 and MYD88.

Comparison of mutation-positive AML demonstrated more mutations present in cytogenetically normal cases, compared with those with chromosome abnormalities detected. Conversely, in 11 cases no mutations were detected by heme-NGS, with 10/11 of these cases showing recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities. In those cases where NGS mutations were identified, comparison of cases with normal (CN-AML) and abnormal (CA-AML) cytogenetic studies demonstrated different mutation frequencies, with more mutations detected in CN-AML. Interestingly, TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene in CA-AML and least mutated in CN-AML. These results illustrate the complementary information gained from NGS sequencing performed with conventional cytogenetic studies in diagnostic AML specimens, providing a comprehensive picture of the genomic landscape in this disease.

A number of genes and variants are known to have prognostic/predictive utility in several myeloid malignancies, allowing for more accurate stratification, and enhanced patient management. This has led to consideration of NGS for detection of somatic mutations in myeloid malignancies in the clinical diagnostic setting, to supplant single-gene molecular testing assays in current use. Building on our prior work establishing a novel mass spectrometry-based high throughput mutation detection assay for hematologic malignancies, we investigated the application of NGS to myeloid malignancy diagnostics. To do this, we validated the Illumina TruSight Myeloid Sequencing Panel (54 genes, 568 amplicons) on 71 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patient samples, alongside relevant controls. NGS Libraries were prepared using standard protocols, and sequencing performed on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Concordance among NGS calls, single gene tests, and Sanger verification was tested as part of the clinical validation process.Analysis of 41 cases tested in our previously developed mass spectrometry assay indicated 100% concordance (70/70) for reportable variants mutually covered in both assays. Single nucleotide variations detectable in lab-standard single gene assays were all found by NGS (100% concordance). 58/71 (82%) cases had at least one additional potentially clinically relevant variant that would not have been identified in the existing assay (mean 1.95 additional variants/case; range 1-9). Additionally, we determined that AMLs carrying IDH1, IDH2 or TET2 mutations had a higher mutation burden (mean 4.6 mutations/case, range 2-7), compared to AMLs wild-type for these three genes (mean 3.1 mutations/case, range 2-4; p = 0.008). Clinically relevant insertions (up to 33 bp) and deletions (up to 52 bp) associated with AML and MPN, including FLT3 ITD and CALR deletions, were detected in known positive cases. In these cases, our analysis was supplemented with a custom bioinformatics algorithm allowing for alignment against an artificial reference sequence to detect larger indels. Due to low coverage of the clinically actionable CEBPA, we supplemented the NGS assay with Sanger sequencing for this locus. Therefore, we report the validation of an NGS panel for high throughput detection of mutations in myeloid malignancies, and the development of a wet-bench and informatics workflow enabling maximal information benefit in the diagnostic setting. This pipeline allows the detection of variants that impact diagnosis and patient management, with significantly improved information benefit over current tests.']",

We discovered IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in 29 of 305 (9%) intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. Tumors with mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 had lower 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and higher 5-methylcytosine levels, as well as increased dimethylation of histone H3K79.

As there are few in-vivo model systems for IDH-mutated tumors we have created a transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio) model expressing mutant IDH1. We have chosen the zebrafish as a model because they are transparent (allowing monitoring of the transgene in-vivo) and drug screening assays are straightforward (they are simply added to the aquarium).IDH1R132H and IDH1R132C, mutations found in tumors that both produce D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG) instead of alpha ketoglutarate, were cloned into an expression construct that is driven either by the Nestin or GFAP promoter. IDH1G70D (a loss of function mutation), IDH1wildtype and GFP were used as control. All IDH1 constructs were fused to GFP for visualization. These constructs were injected into fertilized zebrafish eggs at the one-cell stage.All of our transgenic zebrafish lines remain healthy and produce offspring. Transgene expression was detected in the mid/hindbrain of the central nervous system by immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RT-QPCR. A significant increase in the level of D2HG was observed in all transgenic lines expressing IDH1R132C or IDH1R132H, but not in any of the lines expressing control constructs (IDH1wildtype, IDH1G70D or GFP). In contrast to reported, we failed to detect any differences in hydroxymethyl cytosine (the first step in DNA-demethylation) and mature collagen IV levels between wildtype and mutant IDH1 transgenic fish. We also performed microinjections on fertilized eggs to screen for early developmental effects of IDH1R132H and IDH1R132C. Despite of the high expression of the transgene, no developmental effects were found. Our observations therefore suggest that elevated levels of D2HG are insufficient to initiate tumorigenesis or other phenotypic effects in our fish. Treatment of the transgenic zebrafish with an IDH1 mutant inhibitor, AGI-5198, resulted in a reduction in the D2HG level in the mutant zebrafish. The L2HG level was not affected by AGI-5198. As no tumors were formed in our transgenic zebrafish lines, we backcrossed them with Tp53 mutant fish. Analysis of these lines is currently being performed.In summary, we have generated a transgenic zebrafish model system that expresses mutated IDH1 that can be used to study effects of mutant IDH1 (or elevated levels of D2HG) in vivo and can be used for drug screening.']",

In light of the fact that IDH1-null mice are particularly sensitive to oxidative damage, we hypothesize that this enzyme plays a critical role in PDA survival of acute stress. We examined the expression levels of all eight well-characterized NADPH-generating enzymes in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro, and demonstrate that only IDH1 and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD) are upregulated by >2-fold after incubation in low glucose (5 mM) for 48 hours. IDH1-knockout MiaPaCa2 cells were generated through CRISPR gene editing, such that mRNA expression was detected at <5% of control levels. ROS levels detected by DCFDA measurements were increased by 55% in IDH1-knockout cells compared to isogenic controls under normal culture conditions, with even higher levels under low glucose and chemotherapy stress for 48 hours. Additionally, IDH1-knockout cells were more sensitive to chemotherapy under both high and low glucose conditions, compared to IDH1-proficient control cells.

Mosaic germline mutations such as those affecting RB1, TP53 and AKT1 are important for clinical testing. However, it is challenging to detect mosaic mutation by genome-wide sequencing approaches as a mutant allele present at a low fraction in a germline sample can be caused by either tumor-in-normal contamination or mosaicism. Here we propose a two-step analytical approach to distinguish between these two possibilities. The first involves assessing the level of tumor-in-normal contamination using all clonal somatic mutations identified through the analysis of tumor purity and chromosome ploidy. The second step determines the probability of mosaicism for a candidate variant by calculating the binomial probability of its mutant allele fraction (MAF) under the contamination hypothesis. We applied this process to 1,172 paired tumor-normal pediatric cancer samples analyzed by whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing. Six mosaic variants were identified, including three pathogenic TP53 mutations with a mutant allele fractions (MAF) ranging from 0.2 to 0.3, one RB1 mutation in a retinoblastoma case with a MAF of 0.08, one IDH1 p.R132H mutation in an acute myeloid leukemia case with a MAF of 0.21, and one mosaic RYR2 p.E1690D mutation in an osteosarcoma case with a MAF of 0.11. At the same time, we were able to reject three candidate TP53 variants caused by contamination with MAFs ranging from 0.06 to 0.33. All predicted mosaic mutations were verified by ultra deep sequencing at 10,000X coverage.

Although, it is now feasible to perform single-cell RNA-Seq on thousands of, several challenges remain for high-throughput single-cell DNA sequencing. To address these challenges and enable the characterization of genetic diversity in cancer cell populations, we developed a novel approach that barcodes amplified genomic DNA of individual cells confined to microfluidic droplets. The barcodes are used to reassemble the genetic profiles of individual cells from next generation sequencing data. A key feature of our approach is the “two-step” microfluidic workflow that releases genomic DNA from cellular proteins prior to amplification. The microfluidic workflow first encapsulates individual cells in droplets, lyses the cells and prepares the lysate for genomic DNA amplification using proteases. Following this lysate preparation step, the proteases are inactivated and droplets containing the genomes of individual cells are then paired with molecular barcodes and PCR reagents. We demonstrate that the two-step microfluidic approach is vastly superior to workflows without the two-step process for efficient DNA amplification on tens of thousands of individual cells per run with high coverage uniformity and low allelic dropout of targeted genomic regions. To apply our single-cell sequencing technology to the study of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we developed a targeted panel to sequence genes frequently mutated in AML including TP53, DNMT3A, FLT3, NPM1, NRAS, KRAS, JAK2, IDH1 and IDH2.

Despite the power of next-generation DNA sequencing to describe AML genomes and to identify recurrent mutations, our fundamental understanding of the genomics of leukemogenesis is incomplete. Founder mutations in the majority of AML cases are unknown because pre-leukemic cells are clinically silent and are outcompeted by their malignant descendants. Our limited knowledge of founder mutations comes from infrequent cases of AML arising secondary to antecedent clonal bone marrow disorders or rare instances of inherited syndromes. Importantly, recent advances in AML stem cell biology now enable the prospective separation of residual non-leukemic hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from AML cells. We previously showed that non-leukemic HSC contain clonal antecedents of AML in patients in long-term remission post-therapy, and have proposed a model in which serial acquisition of mutations occurs in self-renewing HSC. Here, we investigated this model and the nature of founder mutations through the genomic analysis of de novo AML and patient-matched residual non-leukemic HSC. Using exome sequencing, we identified mutations present in eight individual AML genomes (mean 10 mutations per patient) and screened for them in the residual HSC. We identified several mutations present in residual HSC that retained normal multilineage differentiation in vivo. These putative early mutations detected in residual HSC include NPM1c, mutations in TET2, and novel AML mutations in genes involving the cell cycle and mRNA biogenesis. Putative late mutations absent from residual HSC and only found in leukemic cells include FLT3 ITD and IDH1 R132H. Finally, through single cell analysis, we determined that as we hypothesized, a clonal progression of multiple mutations occurs in non-leukemic HSC. Quantitative genetic analyses of the HSC compartment enabled us to reconstruct the subclonal architecture of normal and pre-leukemic stem cells. Consistent with mouse models, pre-leukemic HSC with TET2 mutations outcompeted their normal counterparts. However, in most cases, normal HSC were 6-50 times more numerous than pre-leukemic HSC. In two cases where sequential populations of pre-leukemic HSC were identified, the less mutated pre-leukemic HSC population was 10-25 times more numerous than its more mutated descendent. This result contrasts with the classical model of a linear succession of dominant pre-leukemic subclones. These pre-leukemic HSC reveal the clonal evolution of AML genomes from founder mutations, suggest a potential mechanism contributing to relapse, and constitute a cellular reservoir that may need to be targeted for more durable remissions.']",

        "Background":"['Driver somatic mutations confer a selective growth advantage to tumors while passenger mutations do not. Genes carrying driver mutations are detected in whole-exome sequencing (WES) studies if their non-synonymous mutations are significantly more frequent than their silent mutations, adjusting for the heterogeneous mutation rates across genomic locations, subjects and mutation types. Typical tumor WES studies (100-300 tumor samples) lack statistical power, and thus can identify only small numbers of candidate driver genes and possibly miss the well-established ones. The best algorithm to detect driver genes to date is MutSigCV. For each target gene, MutSigCV identifies its bagel, a set of genes predicted to have similar background mutation rates to the target gene and use the bagels to estimate the background mutation rate. Based on the identified bagels, we developed a novel statistical method implementing a series of algorithms to improve the statistical power while maintaining the type-I error rate. First, we developed a statistical framework for testing the selective growth advantage of each mutation type and appropriately integrating evidence of growth advantage across mutation types to achieve robust power. We then extended the algorithm to consider spatial clustering information. This substantially improves the statistical power when non-silent mutations are clustered into a few short regions or nucleotides. We applied this novel method to TCGA melanoma WES including 271 tumor samples. Without modeling spatial clustering information, over 30 candidate driver genes, including BRAF, NRAS, PTEN, TP53, PPP6C and CDKN2A were detected controlling FDR=0.01. Modeling spatial information of somatic mutations detected additional rarely mutated genes, including DISP1 (P=1.310-20, involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation that leads to normal development of embryonic structures), IDH1 (P=1.010-8, previously identified in relation to gliobalstoma and acute myeloid leukemia), MAP2K1 (P=510-18, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinases that also include BRAF, MEK and other important players in melanoma), INTS8 (P=7.710-15, an integrator of small nuclear RNA processing), and STK19 (P=1.210-10, encoding a serine/threonine kinase, previously identified in melanoma). Finally, we developed methods to simultaneously analyze multiple cancers to improve the power for genes mutated in more than one cancer type, which will be illustrated by analyzing 12 major cancers in TCGA. Our method will provide an important tool for improving driver gene mutation detection in cancer.']",

        "Background":"['The isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) family of enzymes is central to cellular metabolism, catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to -ketoglutarate (-KG) and production of NADPH. Recently, cancer-associated heterozygous somatic mutations in family members IDH1 and IDH2 were discovered and present predominantly in glioblastoma multiforme and acute myeloid leukemia. The major consequence of these point mutations is the biochemical production of the oncometabolite (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2-HG] from -KG. Recent studies indicate that unalike mutations of IDH2 produce different intracellular levels of (R)-2-HG, suggesting that IDH2 mutations may differentially influence tumorigenesis. Contrasting clinical studies find IDH mutations to be associated either with increased metastatic potential, or higher survival and enhanced chemosensitivity probabilities. Nevertheless, these studies failed to indicate specifically which of the various IDH mutations were found in each of the patients tumors. This raises important questions as to whether specific IDH mutations contribute differently to tumorigenesis. In this study, specific IDH2 mutations were evaluated and compared for their chemosensitivity, tumorigenic activity, and production of (R)-2-HG- all notable determinants for their potential use as tumor biomarkers. Three individual clinically relevant IDH2 mutations (IDH2-R172K, -R172M, and -R140Q) or IDH2-WT were expressed in human U87MG glioblastoma cells. We observed distinct changes in cell morphology, proliferation, migration, invasion, anchorage-independent growth and response to chemotherapeutic agents. Differences in base-line activation of various stress pathways were also observed, lending a plausible explanation to the differing phenotypic outcomes. Interestingly, the variable levels of endogenous (R)-2-HG produced by the cell panel inversely correlated with their respective growth rates, implicating (R)-2-HG as a negative regulator of tumor growth. Indeed, treatment of tumor cell lines, expressing IDH2-WT, with exogenous (R)-2-HG induced a decrease in cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. When tested in vivo, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with (R)-2-HG significantly reduced tumor volume. These in vivo results complement the results of soft-agar colony forming assays, demonstrating again that (R)-2-HG inhibits tumor growth. In contrast, immortalized cells subjected to long-term (R)-2-HG treatment showed enhanced cell proliferation. Their response to (R)-2-HG, however, could be switched from growth promotion to that of growth inhibition through expression of oncogenic Ras. Thus, these findings demonstrate conclusively that IDH2 mutations are not alike and that oncometabolite (R)-2-HG plays dual roles in tumorigenesis.']",

Many signaling pathways have been implicated in mechanisms leading to the shift of metabolic programs in tumors, but more recently a small number of metabolic enzymes have also been identified in this process. Genes encoding the metabolic enzymes Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and 2 (IDH2) were found to be mutated in up to 70% of low-grade and medium grade gliomas, and in 15-20% of adult acute leukemia samples. These findings were the first to link the IDH gene to tumorigenesis. IDH1 and IDH2 function to irreversibly catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to -ketoglutarate (-KG). Although these are important metabolic enzymes, little is known about the metabolic impact harboring mutant IDH protein has on cells. Our goal is to model the IDH mutant phenotype in Drosophila glial cells for further characterization of both metabolic status, and IDH enzymatic activity. To this end, we have generated Drosophila cell lines and transformant flies that express the most commonly identified IDH mutations under control of the UAS-Gal4 system. We have also investigated the metabolic flux of Drosophila cell lines expressing IDH mutant protein, and loss of IDH function, and glycolytic enzyme expression analysis. Currently, we are investigating the metabolic flux analysis (MFA) using labeled metabolites as well as comparing the protein interactions of the wild type to the mutant IDH cells.

        "Background":"['Mutations at the active site of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IDH1; R132H) occur at a high frequency (>70%) early in the oncogenesis of lower grade malignant gliomas, and result in a dramatic accumulation of the oncometabolite D-2 hydroxyglutarate ( D-2HG), that effectively replaces the normal metabolite α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) in cell physiology. Surprisingly, IDH1 mutations bestow superior therapeutic responses to alkylating agents and better patient survival. D-2HG, effectively competes with α-KG and potently inhibits various dioxygenase reactions, including the TET1, TET2 DNA -demethylases and histone demethylases (5m-cytosine to 5-OH cytosine, H3-K-meX to H3-K-meX-1) thereby, re-shaping and reprogramming the epigenetic landscape, and consequent transcriptional silencing; the DNA repair protein O6-methlguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which confers drug resistance is one major target for such repression. As a novel and innovative strategy of turning the tide against GBMs by exploiting the mechanistic aspects of the oncometabolite, we hypothesized that D-2HG and α-KG derivatives that can replace the natural metabolite in epigenomic dioxygenase reactions will serve as potent anti-glioma drugs either by themselves or in combination with the alkylating agents. To this end, we first synthesized a D-2HG diethyl ester to enhance its cellular uptake and tested its effects on four human brain tumor cell lines (DAOY, T98G, SF188 and UW18). This compound, at 5-10 mM and 24 h treatments, moderately inhibited the DNA repair activity of MGMT, increased temozolomide cytotoxicity by 1.5 to 3-fold, and induced histone H3-methylations as determined by western blot analyses. To increase the potency and design better compounds mimicking the oncometabolite and validate its impact on epigenesis, we synthesized a 2,4-dimethyleneglutaric acid (DMG), a α-KG mimic with methylene groups inserted at the C2 and C4 positions. The hydrophobic DMG ester, by itself, was cytotoxic with IC50 values up to 500 µM against brain tumor cell lines, however, when combined at 100 µM with TMZ resulted in a great synergistic cell killing (generally-9 fold, but 28-fold with UW-18 GBM cells). 0.25 mM DMG inhibited the cellular MGMT activity by >80%, induced degradation of TET1 protein and highly increased the methylation levels of histones (H1K25me1, me2 and H2BK25me2). Currently, experiments to determine the BBB-penetrance of DMG, its ability to induce genomic and MGMT-specific methylations in glioma cells and GBM regression in intracranial xenograft models developed in nude mice are underway. Collectively, these data reveal that acute treatments of α-KG analogs can alter the cellular epigenetic makeup in a manner ascribed to D-2HG, and open up the much-needed novel and exciting avenues of oncometabolite therapy for brain tumors (supported by CPRIT grants RP130266 & RP170207 to KSS).']",

The latter have come into focus because of their interesting characteristics', ' they have a more favorable outcome and better response to chemo/radiotherapy. This is correlated with a unique unbalanced translocation der(1;19)(q10;p10) causing a codeletion of the short arm of chromosome 1 and the long arm of chromosome 19. Like the other lower grade gliomas, a large percentage of oligodendrogliomas carry the IDH1 R132 mutation and this is associated with the presence of the codeletion. We identified a high number of mutations in the remaining alleles of the Capicua homolog gene (CIC) and in the far upstream element binding protein (FUBP1) in 1p/19q codeleted oligodendrogliomas (Eisenreich et al. 2013, doi', '10.1371/journal.pone.0076623). Both genes are suspected to act as tumor suppressor genes. We then analyzed the expression profiles of 13 oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas both with the 1p/19q codeletion (nine samples) and without (four samples) using a combination of expression microarrays and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). Our results showed that all nine samples with the 1p/19q codeletion carried the heterozygous IDH1 R132H mutation while only one tumor without the codeletion carried said mutation. There was a high concordance between the results of RNA-Seq and the microarray experiments and both showed a distinctive expression signature between samples with the 1p/19q codeletion and those without. Using MSigDB, we found that the genes whose expression was altered in in tumors with the 1p/19q codeletion showed significant overlap with those involved in stemness and differentiation and genes that had CpG-rich promoters. Furthermore, there was an overlap with genes with altered expression in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). When we compared the expression of genes located on 1p and 19q between the tumors with the 1p/19q codeletion and those without, we found that only 82% of genes on 1p and 19q were downregulated significantly. When we ran the upregulated genes in PathScan, we found enrichment in GA binding protein alpha (GABPA)binding sites. GABPA expression levels were increased in our glioma samples with and without the 1p/19q codeletion. Investigating the expression levels of GABPA in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBM dataset also revealed an upregulation of this transcription factor. An increase in GABPA-mediated transcription was recently reported in CML but has not been yet reported in gliomas. We therefore propose that GABPA is an important transcription factor in gliomas.

Methods', ' We are conducting a prospective study at MGH and DFCI to (1) assess changes in serum and urine 2-HG levels during treatment in patients with newly diagnosed AML, (2) compare 2-HG levels in serum, urine, and bone marrow and, (3) serially compare 2-HG levels with IDH1/2mutant allele burden.  In those with elevated serum 2-HG (1000ng/ml), 2-HG is monitored serially or at relapse. Results', ' To date, 20 patients have been enrolled, 5 (25%) of whom had elevated baseline serum 2-HG.  All 5 were found to have IDH1/2 mutations. The serum 2-HG for these patients was significantly higher than for those who were IDH-wt (median 1933 vs 87ng/mL; p<0.001).  Urine 2-HG was also higher in IDH-mutant patients (median 30500 vs 4230ng/mL; p<0.021), as was bone marrow 2-HG (median 9870 vs 309ng/mL; p<0.005). Serum 2-HG levels strongly correlated with that in urine (R2 0.987).  Serum 2-HG decreased in all IDH mutant patients on therapy, but more rapidly in those receiving induction chemotherapy (Table), all of whom achieved remission, than those receiving hypomethylatingagents. Conclusions', ' Patients with IDH-mutant AML have markedly elevated serum and urine 2-HG. 2-HG levels decreased with therapy and there is a strong correlation between serum and urine 2-HG.  Data on the sensitivity of serial 2-HG monitoring as well as comparison with mutant IDH1/2allele burden will be presented. This data suggests that serial 2-HG quantification may be a valuable non-invasive biomarker in this genetically defined subset of AML.

        "Background":"['Background', ' In a phase II study in 50 elderly patients (pts) with AML who were not eligible for intensive chemotherapy, treatment with pracinostat + azacitidine (AZA) was well tolerated, led to 42% complete remission (CR) rate and a median overall survival (OS) of 19.1 months (Blood 2016', ' 128;100). Here we investigate the impact of somatic mutations and their clearance on disease response and patient outcomes. Methods', ' 88 samples from 41 study pts were sequenced. All 41 pts were analyzed pre-treatment, and a median of 3 longitudinal samples were analyzed from 19 pts between Cycle 2 and 9. Mutations were assayed by SureSelect targeted capture exon sequencing (Agilent) of 295 genes that are recurrently mutated in hematologic malignancies. Longitudinal mutation clearance was analyzed by plotting variant allele frequency (VAF). Results', ' At baseline, 96 mutations in 28 genes were detected in 38 pts, with the most frequent being in SRSF2 (27%), DNMT3A (20%), IDH2 (17%), RUNX1 (17%), and TET2(17%). Mutations associated with CR rate and OS are indicated in the Table. A CR was achieved in 10/19 pts that had longitudinal sequencing analysis and at the time of CR, 9 (90%) had persistently detectable mutations in their bone marrow. In 7 of them, continued exposure to pracinostat + AZA lowered the VAF or cleared residual mutations. In 2 pts, relapsed samples showed re-expansion of the founder clone. Conclusions', ' Mutations in NPM1, and DNA methylation pathway were associated with a better response to pracinostat + AZA, while TP53 mutation was associated with a poor response. Persistent mutation at the time of CR suggests residual preleukemic clonal hematopoiesis in this elderly population. Benefit of prolonged exposure to pracinostat + AZA was also confirmed at molecular level where continued decline of mutation VAF was seen after achieving CR.

Molecular genetic testing patterns for AML in clinical practice are largely unknown. Previously the CONNECT MDS/AML Disease Registry (George et al. ASH 2016. Abstract 3548) showed suboptimal adherence to WHO 2008 recommendations for AML in a cohort of newly diagnosed (ND) AML patients (pts) in clinical practice. Here we report a detailed analysis of patterns of molecular genetic testing in pts with ND AML in community and academic settings. Methods', ' The CONNECT MDS/AML Disease Registry (NCT01688011) is a US prospective, observational cohort study of pts with ND AML (55 years) or MDS. Enrollment is ongoing. All clinical decisions are made by study clinicians. The current analysis evaluated the percentage of pts with AML with molecular genetic testing recommended by NCCN guidelines (NPM1, FLT3-ITD, CEBPA, IDH1, IDH2, DNMT3A, and KIT). Chi-square tests evaluated effects of several variables on likelihood of molecular genetic testing. Results', ' Between 12 Dec 2013, and 8 Dec 2016 (data cutoff), 259 AML pts were enrolled at 86 sites. Molecular genetic testing was reported in 67% (173/259) of pts. Likelihood of testing varied, respectively, for academic vs community sites (76% [70/92] vs 62% [103/167], P= .018), normal vs abnormal karyotype (77% [79/103] vs 59% [79/133], P= .006), age < 65 vs 65 (83% [65/78] vs 60% [108/181], P= .0003), and Medicare vs other insurance (61% [83/137] vs 74% [90/122], P= .025). In pts with molecular genetic testing (n = 173), the mutations tested varied substantially. All of the NCCN-recommended molecular genetic tests were reported in 9% (15/173) of pts, including 8% (6/79) of those with normal karyotype. Of the 7 NCCN-recommended tests, NPM1 (77%) and FLT3-ITD (76%) were most often reported and DNMT3A least often (16%). Conclusions', ' Early data from the CONNECT MDS/AML Disease Registry reveal that despite molecular testing reported in 67% of ND AML pts, a majority do not receive guideline-recommended testing. This prospective registry is uniquely positioned to capture changes in testing patterns as guidelines are established.']",
