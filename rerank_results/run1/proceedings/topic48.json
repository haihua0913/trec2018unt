Here, we report that ectopic overexpression of c-kit in ACC cell lines is sufficient for acquisition of mesenchymal traits, enhanced cell invasion, along with stem cell properties defined by the presence of a CD133+/CD44+ cell subpopulation. c-kit positively regulated expression of known EMT inducers, also activating TGF-to contribute to EMT. c-kit itself was induced by TGF-in ACC cell lines and required for TGF--induced EMT. Xenograft experiments showed that c-kit cooperated with oncogenic Ras to promote tumorigenesis in vivo. Finally, in human specimens of ACC, we found that c-kit was abnormally overexpressed and correlated with the prognosis of ACC.

Salivary gland tumors are complex, due to their broad histological spectrum resulting from multiple tumor cell differentiation. We previously detected that the protein c-kit is involved in the process of salivary gland morphogenesis and tumorigenesis; other recent studies reported alterations in KIT gene in adenoid cystic carcinoma. The aim of the present study is to determine the expression of microRNAs targeting KIT in pleomorphic adenoma (PA) and adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), the most common benign and malignant salivary gland neoplasms, respectively, and that originate from the intercalated duct region. Material and Methods', ' Twenty-five pleomorphic adenoma, 14 adenoid cystic carcinoma and 10 non-neoplastic salivary gland samples were used and miRNA expression was evaluated by Real Time RT-PCR using TaqMan miRNA Assays (miR- 221 and 222). Results', ' Expression of miR-221 was detected in 13 CAC samples and 19 PA samples. In CAC, expression of miR-221 was downregulated in 4 out of 13 (30,77%) samples, upregulated in 4 out of 13 (30,77%) samples, and normal in 5 out of 13 (38,46%) samples. In PA, miR-221 expression was downregulated in 7 out of 19 (36,84%) samples, upregulated in 2 out of 19 (10,53%) samples, and normal in 10 out of 19 (52,63%) samples. Expression of miR-222 was detected in 14 CAC samples and 22 PA samples. In the majority of CAC samples, the expression of miR-222 was similar to that observed in non-neoplastic samples. In PA samples, expression of miR-222 was downregulated in 7 out of 22 (31,8%) samples, upregulated in 8 out of 22 (36,4%) samples, and normal in 7 out of 22 (31,8%) samples. Conclusion', ' The expression of miRNAs 221 and 222 do not present a definite pattern to discriminate PA from ACC.

There is no established approach for saliva markers in salivary gland tumors. These tumors occur approximately in one out of 100,000 adults per year in the USA. We aim to develop a method to identify RNA shed specifically from the salivary glands.The two most common salivary gland malignancies harbor frequent gene fusions, which may be candidate RNA based markers. In mucoepidermoid carcinoma, the MECT1-MAML2 fusion. In adenoid cystic carcinoma, either a MYB-NFIB or MYBL1-NFIB fusion. We identified collection and processing methods to be tested on healthy individuals’ saliva samples. We compared three saliva stimulation methods', ' Chewing Gum, Tabasco and Vitamin C powder with unstimulated collected saliva; and also utilized different processing and RNA extraction procedures', ' Trizol based', ' QIAzol method (Qiagen), RNEasy saliva protecting reagent (Qiagen), OrageneRNA (DNA Genotek), and mirVana Kit (ThermoFisher). We evaluated the RNA´s quantity and quality with Spectrophotometer and Agilent’s 2100 Bio analyzer. We identified two salivary gland specifically highly expressed genes (HTN3 and CA6) to be analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. We have collected and processed 221 samples and analysis is ongoing. Bio analyzer showed that RNA from the unstimulated collected saliva has a higher concentration than stimulated saliva. Unstimulated saliva is expected to contain mucosa cells, bacteria and rests of food, therefore those could also be RNA sources. When saliva’s RNA is protected by either of the buffers tested, the RIN scores (RNA Integrity Number) obtained by Bio analyzer are higher. Based on our preliminary data, stimulation with either Tabasco, Chewing Gum or Vitamin C followed by RNA stabilization with the OrageneRNA kit and extraction with Trizol resulted in the highest quality and specificity of the RNA for its salivary gland origin. Unstimulated collection followed by the same processing generates a greater RNA yield. This saliva RNA is likely contaminated with RNA form squamous cells, bacteria and food residues, which may decrease the sensitivity of the specific gene expression of HTN3 and CA6. Once established how to best collect and protect saliva for the extraction of nucleic acids originated from the salivary glands, we anticipate accelerating the path to clinically highly demanded kits for the surveillance of salivary gland cancer patients. We plan to prospectively collect samples from Salivary gland tumor patients with the chosen method and evaluate tumor related markers. The detection of tumor markers in bodily fluids will open a new avenue for the diagnosis and the clinical management of patients with this type of tumor.

Our previous publications demonstrated that S100P was a highly sensitive biomarker in identifying pancreatic mucinous neoplasms (PMNs) and invasive ductal adenocarcinomas (ADCs) on both cytological and surgical specimens. When working on pancreatic cystic lesions, there are two important undertakings', \" 1) distinguishing mucinous neoplasms from non-mucinous cysts and 2) predicting the presence of invasive adenocarcinomas. In this study, we investigated the potential utility of S100P for these purposes.Design. Thirty pancreatic cystic fluid samples obtained by EUS-FNA biopsy were retrieved from Geisinger Biospecimen Bank. Diagnosis was based on definitive cytological diagnosis in all cases and additional surgical pathology confirmation in 11 cases. These 30 samples included 7 benign cysts in Group 1, 14 PMNs in Group 2, and 9 ADCs in Group 3. The S100P protein level of each sample was quantitatively measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) (CircuLex S100P ELISA kit, MBL International Corporation) according to the vendor's protocol.Results. The results are summarized in Table 1. Marked elevation of S100P was seen in 6 of 9 ADCs (2129.81 + 1834.34 ng/ml), in contrast to the moderate increase in Group 2 (666.67 + 1439.91 ng/ml) and the minimal increase in Group 1 (22.27 + 18.62 ng/ml). Using 50 ng/ml as a cutoff value to differentiate a PMN/ADC (Group 2 and Group 3) from a benign cyst (Group 1), the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for identifying a PMN/ADC were 60.9%, 100%, 100%, and 43.8%, respectively.Conclusion. These preliminary data suggest that S100P is a useful biomarker in identifying invasive adenocarcinomas and in distinguishing mucinous neoplasms from non-mucinous cysts. Caution should be taken since some ADCs may show only mildly increased S100P levels, similar to some PMNs and non-mucinous cysts.

SRMS was first identified in a screen for the genes that regulate the growth and differentiation of neuroepithelial cells. SRMS, however, is an understudied member of this family. The present study was undertaken in order to explore the role of SRMS in signaling downstream of KIT. The receptor tyrosine kinase KIT, also known as the stem cell factor receptor, plays a key role in several developmental processes and have been implicated in many human cancers such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, acute myeloid leukemia and testicular carcinoma. To understand the role of SRMS in KIT signaling, we generated Ba/F3 cell lines overexpressing KIT and SRMS. We observed that SRMS regulates normal and oncogenic KIT signaling differentially with respect to cell proliferation and apoptosis. SRMS association triggers KIT ubiquitination which in turn downregulates the receptor. Further, expression of SRMS downregulates wild-type KIT-mediated phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2, p38. Taken together the data demonstrates that SRMS regulates both normal KIT and an oncogenic mutant of KIT, and have differential impact on receptor downstream signaling.']",

        "Background":"['Cancer stem cells (CSC) are a rare subpopulation of undifferentiated cells that are responsible for tumor initiation and tumor regeneration after chemotherapy. Although a universal marker for CSCs has not been identified, previous studies showed that c-kit (CD117) functioned as a stem cell factor (SCF) receptor, and SCF-ckit signaling axis was essential for self-renewal and proliferation of lung CSCs. During tumorigenesis, subsets of tumor cells disseminate from primary tumors by undergoing phenotypic changes that allow the cells to penetrate blood vessels. These changes are accompanied by a process described as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT endows epithelial cells with enhanced invasive potential by the loss of their epithelial characteristics and the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype. The aim of this study is to correlate c-kit-positive CSCs and EMT-positive, subpopulations of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with clinicopathological parameters to verify whether these biomarkers contribute to cancer distant metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 31 patients with NSCLC were enrolled into this study and evaluated for CTC levels at baseline. Peripheral blood samples (5 ml, anticoagulated with EDTA) were collected, transferred to the CanPatrol CTC tube, and then processed within 8 hours. The CanPatrol CTC enrichment technique was used to isolate and characterize CTCs. The first step of this technique was to isolate CTCs via a filter-based method; then, an quantifiable, quadruple-colorimetric RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) method was used to examine CTCs for expression of four epithelial (E) biomarkers (cytokeratins (CKs)8,18 and 19; and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)), two mesenchymal (M) biomarkers (vimentin and twist), c-kit and CD45. Using this technique, CTCs were detected in 25(80.6%) of 31 blood samples, and five categories of CTCs were defined using EMT biomarkers ranging from exclusively epithelial (E) to intermediate (E > M, E = M, M > E) and exclusively mesenchymal (M). Of the CTC-positive samples, 13(52%) samples contained c-kit-positive CTCs, and the percentage of cells with c-kit expression was 27.8%, with 2.1%, 4.6%, 2.1%, 18.3% and 0.8% in exclusively E, E > M, E = M, M > E and exclusively M CTCs, respectively. The expression of c-kit showed a high statistically significant correlation with distant metastasis (P = 0.0001). Compared with the non metastatic or regional metastatic carcinoma, mesenchymal CTCs (including M > E and exclusively M) were predominant in patients with distant metastatic carcinoma (P = 0.033). However, the sample size of this study was small, further validation needed to be done with a larger sample size. In summary, mesenchymal CTCs or/and c-kit may be potential predictive factors for invasion and metastatic spread of NSCLC.']",

Accounting for only 2-3%, carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) presents a challenge for clinicians in diagnosis and therapy. Tissue biopsy is the standard for diagnosis but there is need for improved methodology including a non-invasive blood test that may rely on CTC analysis. We have been developing a post-Veridex CTC analysis method using multiplexed Q-dot conjugated antibodies with the goal of detection of multiple markers in each single cell within a CTC population to aid in CUP diagnosis including tissue of origin. We have developed an immunofluorescence (IF) protocol with a minimal set of markers to predict the primary sites and provide prognostic information for common metastatic tumors', ' melanoma, lung, colorectal, upper gastrointestinal organs, and breast or prostate cancer. Two kits are available to isolate CTCs through Veridex CellSearch', \" melanoma kit (using melanoma antigen), and epithelial or carcinoma kit (using EpCam). A patient's blood is initially tested with both kits, and positive CTCs from the melanoma kit supports a diagnosis of melanoma, whereas positive CTCs from the epithelial kit supports carcinoma. For carcinomas, we use cytokeratin 7 (CK7), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), estrogen receptor (ER) or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as the minimal set of markers. IF has been optimized in cultured tumor cells, first with individual antibodies, then quantum dots (Q-dot) conjugated multiplex quadra-antibody set. We evaluated antibodies by IF specific to these 5 markers in lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer cell lines. The CK7 and ER antibodies conjugated to Qdot 605 and 705 respectively demonstrated expression in the appropriate cell lines. CK7-Qdot 605 and ER-Qdot 705 expression in cells that were recovered after being spiked into normal blood samples and isolated by the Veridex CellSearch system was similar to that observed with unconjugated antibodies. Our data show that it is feasible to detect expression using Qdot-labeled multiplexed antibodies on tumor cells isolated from blood by Veridex CellSearch system. Successful application of this protocol to CTCs in patient samples is expected to provide a noninvasive, relatively quick and inexpensive blood test that can be both diagnostic and prognostic, which may be a valuable adjunct to routine biopsy.\"]",

Molec. Oncol. 2013; Rijlaarsdam et al. Andrology, 2015). Here we demonstrate the power of the TaqMan Advanced miRNA Assays (PN 478007, Applied Biosystems) in combination with the use of the TaqMan miRNA ABC Purification Kit (PN 4473087, Applied Biosystems), starting with 50 L human serum. The protocol includes polyadenylation of the miRNA targets at the 3 end, followed by an adapter ligation at the 5 end. Universal forward and reverse primers are used for amplification, followed by detection using the Applied Biosystems 7500 RealTime PCR System. Quality controls were added using dilution experiments of the cell lines, also included as inter-plate control, as well as for cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR efficiency. The non-human spike-ins ath-miR159a and cel-miR-39-3p were added as exogenous controls, while hsa-miR-30b-5p was used as endogenous control for normalization (reference). In total 30 GCC-related sera as well as 10 normal controls proved the informativity as well as efficiency of the developed pipeline in a standardized laboratory setting.']",

With attention to the direct connection between the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of tumor cells and the pharmacological effects of specific inhibitors, we systematically assessed the RTK expressions of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung (HGNEC), including SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC).Patients and Methods', 'Fifty-one LCNEC and 61 SCLC patients who underwent surgical resection were enrolled in this research. As a control group, 202 patients with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 122 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs) were also analyzed. Using immunohistochemical staining (IHC), we stained all tumors with antibodies for 10 RTKs; c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET and ROS1. We scored the expression of these RTKs for all enrolled tumors, and compared them according to the histological types.Results', 'The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. Especially, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20% of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.Conclusions', 'Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs. The exclusive c-Kit positivity observed among HGNECs suggested that c-Kit might be a distinctive RTK in HGNEC. These HGNECs which have strongly positive RTKs could be the targets of personalized therapies.']",

        "Background":"['Uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS) is a rare and aggressive form of uterine cancer. It is bi-phasic, exhibiting histological features of both malignant epithelial (carcinomatous) and mesenchymal (sarcomatous) elements. Studies have indicated that UCS arises from sarcomatous differentiation of high-grade carcinoma while others have suggested a bi-clonal nature. Given these differences, we sought to separate the carcinoma and sarcoma elements of UCS to try to understand their molecular differences and gain further insights into how these tumors develop. We macrodissected carcinomatous, sarcomatous, and normal cells from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) uterine samples of 10 UCS patients. DNA and RNA were isolated and extracted using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE kit. Whole-genome SNP microarrays and deep sequencing of 26 cancer genes was performed, using the Illumina Infinium OmniExpressExome array and the TruSight Tumor panel respectively. Illumina HiSeq mRNA sequencing was also performed to quantify gene expression. The genomic allelic imbalance (AI) profiling, called from the SNP data by hapLOH, showed that sarcoma samples were more aberrant than their carcinoma counterparts (abstract 131, AACR 2016). From the targeted sequencing, the Illumina Amplicon-DS Somatic Variant Caller was employed to call somatic mutations. Mutations were identified in TP53 in both the sarcoma and carcinoma samples of all 10 patients. Frequently mutated genes included APC, EGFR, MET and MSH6 which were found in 60-80% of the patients. Genes mutated in less than 50% of the patients included PTEN, KRAS, KIT, FBXW7, PIK3CA, FGFR2, and CTNNB1. Current results showed no association of a mutated gene to either the sarcoma or carcinoma component of UCS. RSEM, STAR and EBSeq were applied to the RNA-seq data for gene expression quantification. Approximately 2500 genes were identified as being differentially expressed (DE) between normal and carcinoma samples. Just over 4000 genes were identified as being DE between normal and sarcoma samples. 75% of the DE genes in the carcinoma were also identified in the sarcoma. Using DAVID functional annotation tool, we characterized these gene sets with KEGG pathways. Deregulated pathways identified in both carcinoma and sarcoma include', ' cell cycle, transcriptional regulation, Ras and p53 signaling. Some additional pathways are putatively associated with sarcoma only, including MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling. We report here the differences between sarcoma and carcinoma components of UCS from multiple molecular perspectives. From the genomic AI and DE analysis, the carcinoma aberrations appear to be mostly a subset of the sarcoma tumor profiles, where sarcoma samples appear to be more highly aberrant compared to the carcinoma samples. One possible inference from this is that the sarcoma originated and evolved from the carcinoma cells.']",

Curative treatment relies on surgery sometimes completed by radiotherapy. Management of non-surgical, locally advanced or metastatic tumors is difficult as conventional chemotherapies are ineffective. Directed therapies may provide important benefits for these patients. The aim of this work was to assess the expression and prognostic value of directed therapy targets on salivary gland tumors and search for mutations within the key players of the EGFR pathway.  Methods', '  Immunochemistry on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples from 124 patients for c-KIT, EGFR, c-ERBB2, MUC1, phospho-mTOR, androgen/estrogens/progesterone receptors and Ki67 was performed and related to progression free interval and survival. DNA was extracted from FFPE samples and conditional for treatment mutations of EGFR/KRAS/BRAF were assessed. An additional high throughput screening for mutations of key oncogenic genes was performed.  Results', '  EGFR was the most expressed marker, found across almost all histotypes. Expression of the other markers was heterogeneous but some potential therapy leads were suggested by high levels of C-ERBB2 and androgen receptors in salivary duct carcinomas or C-KIT over expression in myoepithetial carcinomas. Tumor grade and a high proliferation index (Ki67>20%) were associated with progression free interval and survival. None of the other marker was. No mutation was found in EGFR/KRAS/BRAF. 7% (7/104) of the tumors harbored a mutation at the codon 61 of HRAS. In epithelial and epithelial-myopithlial carcinoma, the mutation rate reached 33%. Mutations of PI3K and p53 were the most frequently found in the broader screen.  Conclusions', '  Several tumor subtypes expressed frequently some targets of directed therapies suggesting potential therapy leads. The EGFR/MAPK pathway seems intact suggesting a low efficacy of small kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib or gefitinib. The mutation of H-RAS, known to be important but not sufficient to trigger urothelial carcinoma, could be a key oncogenic event in tumors with a myoepithelial component.']",

For pts with stage I disease, the recurrence rate was 29% (23/78 pts) on surveillance and 4% (2/49 pts) with adjuvant chemo therapy. Certain pts with clinical stage I NSGCT who developed recurrence on active surveillance appeared to be at increased risk of dying from disease [i.e., E', ' 0/5 = 0%, EYT', ' 2/15 (13%), EYST', ' 2/5 (40%)]. This result needs further confirmation and additional investigation. Two (25%) of 8 pts with advanced EYST harbored a KIT somatic mutation. Conclusions', ' Our data suggest that chemo-resistance of NSGCT is related to the tumor subtypes. Pts with clinical stage I NSGCT who develop recurrence on active surveillance with histologically EYST subtype may be at increased risk of dying from disease. Understanding the role of intratumoral heterogeneity in the development of refractory disease may improve treatment strategies and the clinical outcome of pts with NSGCT.']",

Using high-throughput microarray-based biomarker screening low cost diagnostic array real-time PCR panels may be developed. We aimed to determine molecular markers for enhancing the differentiation of high-grade dysplasia from colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and to analyze the applicability of FFPE tissue samples. Material and Methods', ' Discriminatory transcript set was identified using HGU133plus2 microarrays (Affymetrix Inc.) on 53 biopsy samples (22 CRC, 20 adenoma, 11 normal). For testing the classificatory power of the discriminatory genes, 94 independent biopsies (27 CRC, 29 adenoma, 38 normal) were analyzed on microarrays. Array real-time PCR validation was done on 68 independent samples (24 CRC, 24 adenoma, 20 normal) using LightCycler480 system (Roche) and RealTime ready assays. Reverse transcription was done using Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche). For testing the applicability of FFPE tissues, total RNA was isolated from 10um-thick slides of 5 CRC and 2 adjacent normal samples using High Pure RNA Paraffin Kit (Roche). The same cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR conditions were applied as in case of fresh frozen samples. Results', ' A set of 11 transcripts was determined which could correctly discriminate between not only the normal, adenoma and CRC samples, but between high-grade dysplastic adenoma and CRC samples by 100% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity. The discriminatory power of the marker set was proved to be high on independent fresh frozen biopsy samples in both microarray and RT-PCR analyses. 95.6% of original and 94.1% of cross-validated samples were correctly classified in discriminant analysis. According to the RT-PCR results for the set of 11 markers, tumorous and normal FFPE tissue samples could be distinguished by 100% sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion', ' The identified transcripts could correctly characterize the dysplasia-carcinoma transition in colonic tissue samples, also on a large independent sample set and on FFPE tissue samples.

While these disorders are rare in people, they are among the most common malignancies in the dog, a circumstance that provides a useful model for an orphan disease. Growth of both normal and neoplastic mast cells is driven by c-kit (CD117), a tyrosine kinase receptor for stem cell factor. Ligand-independent, constitutive activation of c-kit via mutation is a common feature of mastocytic neoplasia. Therefore, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target c-kit have activity in aggressive mastocytosis in people and in dogs. However, resistance to c-kit targeted TKIs is common in both species, highlighting a need for other therapeutic targets.Our data indicates that chromatin modification may be important in mast cell biology. Specifically, we have shown that the JmjC domain lysine 36 specific histone H3 demethylase, NDY1/KDM2B, supports the proliferation and immortalization of bone-marrow derived mast cells. It is well known that NDY1/KDM2B is a driver of hematopoietic transformation and is associated with malignant progression in certain solid tumors (breast, pancreatic and urothelial carcinoma). Therefore, we investigated the effects of knockdown of NDY1/KDM2B in neoplastic human and canine mast cells in vitro and in xenografts.

Yet, therapeutic strategies that utilize these genetic aberrations are lacking. In the present study, we aimed to identify and validate new kinase targets in ovarian clear cell carcinoma.Methods', ' To determine new mutations, kinome sequencing (SureSelect Human Kinome Kit, Agilent Technologies) was performed on DNA isolated from tumor samples (n = 124) and matched controls (n = 46) for 571 kinases, 6 PI3K regulatory components and 46 other cancer related genes.

There are a lack of quality pre-clinical models for cachexia research. Previously, Champions Oncology reported a mouse cachexia model derived from a primary human renal cell carcinoma tumor implanted in immunocompromised mice. This model, CTG-0804, was developed using the innovative Champions TumorGraft platform, which preserves the biological properties of the original human tumor. The Champions TumorGraft platform demonstrated dramatic weight loss in these mice as the tumor grew. Plasma from these mice also showed elevated levels of human IL-6. We have now further characterized this TumorGraft model by evaluating standard of care (SOC) agents for renal cell carcinoma and anti-IL-6 compounds to determine the mechanism of cachexia. The SOC evaluation revealed that sorafenib, sunitinib, temsirolimus and bevacizumab as single agents provided a survival advantage by inhibiting tumor growth and preventing weight loss in these mice. Blockade of human IL-6 with tocilizumab or ALD518 did not inhibit tumor growth and weight loss still occurred, demonstrating the possibility of other pathways involved in the cachexia mechanism. In addition, the SOC data for sunitinib showed significant tumor growth inhibition, but no regression at the study end point. This correlated with the clinical profile, where sunitinib could not prevent metastasis and the patient eventually progressed. The TumorGraft model was molecularly characterized and mutation analysis revealed a KIT V530I mutation. This mutation has been reported in extra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) and acute myeloid leukemia patients that have responded to c-kit targeting therapies, such as imatanib and dasatinib. Further characterization of this TumorGraft is ongoing to include additional bioinformatics using gene expression and mutation pathway analyses. In summary, we have continued development of this cachexia model using the Champions TumorGraft platform, along with molecular evaluation, to produce a robust and well-characterized approach for cachexia investigation which can also be applied to other areas of drug development and cancer research.']",

Migration is one of the important processes fundamental to cell invasion and dissemination. Role of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is also very important in this crucial process and cannot be ignored. ECM proteins are involved in cell migration, tissue remodeling, angiogenesis and cell adhesion. Fibulin-1 is cysteine-rich, calcium-binding extracellular matrix and plasma protein that has been implicated as playing a role in tumour progression by modulating cell morphology, growth, adhesion, and motility. Increased plasminogen activator (PA) secretion has been observed in malignant cells and tissue and PA is thought to be involved in the processes of tumorigenesis, cancer invasion and metastasis. Laminins are important for proliferation, differentiation, growth, migration & angiogenesis. Besides the structural function of nidogens, it has long been suggested that nidogens play a role in cell attachment and tumor angiogenesis. Objectives This study was aimed to investigate the expression and significance of ECM proteins (Fibulin-1, uPA, Laminin and Nidogen) in advanced carcinoma of uterine cervix. Material & Methods 40 patients of cancer cervix stage IIIb were included in this study. Circulatory levels of Fibulin-1, Laminin and Nidogen were measured using high sensitivity ELISA kits. uPA activity was measured by activity assay kit. The levels of biochemical markers were compared with 20 healthy females, taken as control. mRNA levels of these molecules were further assessed by Real Time RT-PCR. Data was analyzed statistically. Results Statistical significant (p < 0.001) increase was observed in Fibulin-1, uPA and Laminin levels and found to be significantly correlated with each other whereas Nidogen evels were insignificantly increased as compared to controls. Increased mRNA expression for all these molecules has also been observed in the isolated PBMC by qRT-PCR except nidogen (statistically insignificant increase). Conclusion The elevated serum/plasma levels and increased quantitative expression of these ECM proteins suggests their involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease. This study suggests that rise in ECM proteins might contribute to the complicated and unregulated process of metastasis in cancer of cervix. The association of extracellular matrix proteins and the prognosis of the disease may lead to have a better approach in treating the cervical cancer patients with a combination therapy.']",

TLR3 is involved in innate immune response triggered by the binding of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of viral origin. Its consistent expression by malignant epithelial cells suggests that it has some functions in cell proliferation and survival. The aim of this work was to investigate these functions using 3 cell lines derived from Head and Neck squamous cell carcinomas ', ' CNE1 (EBV-negative nasopharyngeal carcinoma), SQ20B (laryngeal carcinoma) and Fadu (hypopharyngeal carcinoma). Cell clones conditionally knocked-down for TLR-3 were derived from each parental cell line by stable transfection of a vector encoding a microRNA targeting TLR3 transcripts and whose expression is regulated by tetracycline. Stimulation of TLR3 in parental cells was done using small concentrations (250 ng/ml) of the synthetic TLR3-ligand poly(A/U). Modest but consistent growth enhancing effects were observed in deficient culture conditions marked by low concentrations of foetal calf serum and/or low amounts of nutrients and/or hypoxia. The influence of TLR3 on growth characteristics was investigated in more details using the CNE1 cells, both parental and conditionally knocked-down for TLR3. We found that under low-serum culture conditions, cell doubling time was shortened when TLR3 was stimulated by poly(A', 'U). On the opposite, knocking-down TLR3 resulted in a slower growth. To better understand the mechanism underlying the growth promoting effects of TLR3 in CNE1 cells, we assessed the metabolic changes induced by poly(A/U) stimulation or TLR3 silencing . Using the Seahorse Bioscience XF Glycolysis Stress Test Kit  we found that the glycolytic capacity of CNE1 was significantly increased under stimulation by poly(A', 'U), whereas it was decreased under silencing of TLR3. Finally, we investigated the impact of TLR3-stimulation on the expression of HIF1-alpha which is a key transcription factor for cell adaptation to hypoxia and a major regulator of glucid metabolism. Western blot analysis showed that HIF1-alpha could be detected even in normoxic conditions when CNE1 cells were treated by poly(A', 'U) for 24 hours in low serum conditions. On the other hand, knocking-down TLR3 in CNE1 cells resulted in a decrease in the cellular concentration of HIF1-alpha under hypoxia. Overall, these results suggest that TLR3-stimulation induces metabolic changes favorable to cell growth in deficient culture conditions. Future investigations will intend to investigate', ' 1) the in vivo functions of TLR-3 using xenografted CNE1 cells; 2) the contribution of HIF1-alpha to the metabolic changes resulting from TLR3 stimulation; 3) the nature and origin of the endogenous ligands of TLR3.']",

Plasma cfDNA and tumor DNA from each patient were subjected to next generation sequencing utilizing a 50-gene mutation panel. Mutations in cfDNA and tumor DNA specimens, both prior to and after NACT, were compared. Results', ' Plasma cfDNA appears to detect more targetable mutations.

Five of the 19 genes noted to be mutated in the cfDNA prior to NACT have FDA-approved targeted agents and 7 patients could have been candidates for these drugs, compared to only one targetable mutated gene in the tumor. Similar findings were noted with respect to mutations in the cfDNA when compared to the tumor DNA after NACT. Specifically, 21 mutated genes with 54 mutations were identified in the cfDNA compared to 6 mutated genes and 37 mutations in the tumor.

CSCs have been identified by the use of various stem cell markers; however, it remains unclear how individual CSC markers are expressed in individual tumors. We hypothesized that the distinct marker-positive CSCs show unique features of tumorigenicity/metastasis and chemosensitivity which may reflect the heterogeneous nature of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry analyses were used to analyze 364 tumor specimens. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to isolate marker-positive HCC cells, which were tested for hepatic stem/progenitor cell properties. CSC markers EpCAM and CD90 are independently expressed in primary liver cancer. EpCAM+ cells share features with tumorigenic epithelial stem cells, whereas CD90+ cells share those of metastatic vascular endothelial cells with expression of c-Kit. CD90+ cells facilitate metastasis of EpCAM+ cells through activation of TGF-beta signaling, and this effect is abolished by c-Kit inhibitor imatinib mesylate. These distinct tumorigenic/metastatic CSCs can evolve from marker-negative cells de novo, and their frequencies vary dramatically according to the genomic alterations and genotoxic stress. Our results suggest that liver CSCs are not a single, static entity but rather exist heterogeneously and undergo dynamic changes through genomic alteration and genotoxic stress. The evolution of CSCs explains the enrichment of CSCs in advanced cancer and the limitation of targeting marker-positive CSCs alone for tumor eradication.']",

No mutations were detected in the non-neoplastic thyroid and 1/3 FAs contained a KRAS mutation. All three mutation-negative FCs were oncocytic variants and showed upregulation of ≥2 cancer-associated genes including FN-1, GAL-3, HMGA2, PLAB, and RAP2a. The two mutation-negative PCs showed upregulation of 4 cancer-associated genes including FN-1, CK-19, GAL-3, HMGA2, and PLAB.

Tandutinib is a novel quinazoline-based inhibitor of the type III receptor tyrosine kinases including c-Kit and PDGFR. The current study is designed to determine the effect of tandutinib on colon cancer growth and identified a mechanism of action.Method', ' Colon cancer cell lines HCT116, HT-29 and SW480 and normal colon epithelial cells were used in the study. Cell growth was measured by hexoseaminidase and clonogenicity assays. Apoptosis was determined by measuring caspase 3/7 activities. Cell cycle analysis was measured by Flow cytometry. Signaling proteins were quantified by western blot analysis. For in vivo effects, HCT116 xenografts were developed in the flanks of nude mice. Immunohistochemistry was performed for CD31 and Akt/mTOR signaling proteins.Results', ' Tandutinib treatment resulted in a dose and time dependent inhibition of proliferation and colony formation in all three cell lines but did not affect normal colonic epithelial cells. Treatment also induced colon cancer cells to undergo apoptosis and G0/G1 arrest. Apoptosis was further confirmed by increased levels of activated caspase 3 and Bax/Bcl2 ratio, coupled with a reduction in cyclin D1. There was also a downregulation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-8 expression suggesting effects on cancer promoting genes. Moreover, tandutinib inhibited phosphorylation of c-Kit, Akt, mTOR, p70S6 Kinase and 4EBP1. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt1 overcame this inhibitory effect suggesting a critical role for this pathway. To determine the effect of tandutinib on tumor growth in vivo, nude mice harboring HCT116 tumor xenografts in their flanks were administered the compound intraperitoneally every day for 21 days. Tandutinib treatment significantly suppressed tumor xenograft growth, with notably lower tumor volume and weight. Microvessel density, based on CD31 staining was also significantly lower in the tumors following tandutinib treatment when compared to controls suggesting inhibition of angiogenesis. Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses demonstrated significant inhibition in the expression cancer promoting genes COX-2 and VEGF, and suppressed the activation of Akt/mTOR signaling proteins in the tandutinib-treated xenograft tissues.Conclusion', ' Together, these data suggest that tandutinib is a novel potent therapeutic agent that can target the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway to inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis.']",

To date, the role of miR-605 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has not been investigated. We recently showed the decrease of circulating miR-605 in serum of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients who responded to the treatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor vorinostat, and the VEGF blocker bevacizumab. The current study was designed to investigate the expression of miR-605 and understand the mechanism(s) responsible the extracellular release of miR-605 using RCC cells. Methods', ' 786-0 cells were treated with and without vorinostat for 24h and condition media were collected, briefly centrifuged to settle the cells and debris, and processed to isolate exosomes using the ExoQuick exosome isolation kit (Systems Biology, CA). Purified exosomes and 786-0 cells were used to isolate RNA and further prepared cDNA to utilize for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Expression of miR-605 in exosomes and cells was determined by Quantitative RT-PCR using TaqMan MicroRNA Assays with miR-605 primers obtained from Applied Biosystems, NY. To determine the role of secretory protein 24 family member D (SEC24D), a catalytic component of coat protein complex (COPII) involved in the secretory pathway, 786-0 cells treated with vorinostat were used to determine SEC24D expression by QRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. TCGA data was used to determine correlation of SEC24D expression clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients survival. Results', ' Vorinostat treatment resulted in a significant decrease of miR-605 expression in exosomes and increase (100 fold) of intracellular expression. Furthermore, the increased intracellular miR-605 was associated with the inhibition of SEC24D mRNA and protein expression in 786-0 cells treated with vorinostat. Cancer Genomic data analysis of c-Bioportal from MSKCC of TCGA revealed the overall poor survival of ccRCC patients with alteration of SEC24D. Conclusion', ' Taken together, our preliminary data suggest that the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat inhibits SEC24D and exosome mediated extracellular secretion of miR-605 in RCC cells. These results suggest that vorinostat treatment retained intracellular miR-605 that target genes involved in cell survival and proliferation in RCC. Further studies will evaluate circulating miR-605 as a predictive biomarker to determine the efficacy of vorinostat in ongoing trials with RCC patients.']",

        "Background":"['Summary', ' Breast cancer is a heterogeneous type of cancer accompanying extensive immune cell infiltration. Although its mortality rate has been decreasing with early diagnosis and introduction of molecular targeted therapies, it is still one of the world leading cause of cancer death in women. In breast cancer, molecular subtyping is used for the patient stratification and treatment decisions, emphasizing the importance of inter-patient tumoral heterogeneity in the tumor cell behavior. Tumor cells within a patient may also manifest intra-tumoral heterogeneity, which may cause treatment resistance. Single cell gene expression profiling would reveal both inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity in breast cancer encompassing tumor cells and associated stromal and immune cells.Experimental Process', ' From 4 different subtype primary breast cancer and 2 lymph node metastases, single cells were captured and amplified through C1Single-cell Auto Prep System (Fluidigm) with the SMARTer Ultra Low RNA Kit. Sequencing libraries were constructed with the Nextera XT DNA sample Prep Kit and sequenced through a Hiseq2500 (Illumina) as 100-bp paired end mode of the TruSeq Rapid PE Cluster kit and Truseq Rapid SBS kit.Computational Process', ' RNA sequencing reads were aligned to the modified human genome reference using 2-pass mode of STAR_2.4.0b, and transcript per million (TPM) values were obtained as the relative gene expression levels of single cells through RSEM v1.2.17.Results', ' As most breast cancers originate from the mammary epithelium, we distinguished carcinoma cells from associated non-tumor cells by epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) signature genes. We validated the distinction with chromosomal gene expression patterns and gene set enrichment analyses using tumor, stromal, or immune genesets. With or without removal of non-tumor cells, TNBC tumor cells showed the highest gene expression heterogeneity, recapitulating the known inter-patient heterogeneity. TNBC tumor cells from a single patient were categorized into 6 different TNBC-subtypes, further demonstrating intra-tumoral heterogeneity. In addition, immune cells identified in the TNBC tumor were nave B cells and regulatory T cells, suggesting non-activated status of the immune system.Conclusions', ' The high resolution gene expression profiling revealed features of breast cancer transcriptome which may provide clues for molecular directed therapies targeting the tumor or the immune compartment.']",

Recently, a variety of protracted dosing schedules of temozolomide have been evaluated as a strategy to further enhance its antitumor activity. We reasoned that sorafenib and protracted, daily temozolomide may provide complementary therapeutic benefit, and therefore performed a phase II trial of this regimen among patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Methods', ' Adult patients with GBM at any recurrence after standard temozolomide chemoradiotherapy received sorafenib administered at 400 mg twice daily and continuous daily temozolomide dosed at 50 mg/m2. Assessments were performed after every other cycle. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6) and the secondary end points were radiographic response, overall survival (OS) and safety. Sorafenib pharmacokinetics were assessed on days one and 28 of cycle one. Results', ' Of 32 enrolled patients, twelve (38%) were on CYP3-A inducing antiepileptics (EIAEDs), seventeen (53%) had 2 or more prior progressions, 15 had progressed while receiving 5-day temozolomide, and 12 (38%) had failed either prior bevacizumab or VEGFR inhibitor therapy. The most common grade  3 toxicities were palmer-plantar erythrodysesthesia (19%) and elevated amylase/lipase (13%). Sorafenib pharmacokinetic analyses revealed no differences between patients on day 1 regardless of EIAED status, but significantly lower exposures on day 28 for patients on EIAEDs (p = 0.0431). With a median follow-up of 93 weeks, PFS-6 was 9.4%. Only one patient (3%) achieved a partial response. Conclusions', ' Our study confirms that sorafenib can be safely administered with daily temozolomide, but this regimen has limited antitumor activity among recurrent GBM patients.

We noticed that transfection of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells with miR-1 reveals a typical apoptotic process when observed by time-lapse microscopy. Annexin V and TUNEL staining and caspase assay confirm that miR-1 induces nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell apoptosis. MiR-1 transfection of HeLa, Cal-27, KYSE30 and NPC-TW06 cell lines which express low levels of endogenous miR-1 also induces apoptosis. However, miR-1 transfection of cell lines such as SW620, HepG2, HEK-293T, SAS and PC-13 which express high levels of endogenous miR-1 does not induce apoptosis. To determine miR-1 target genes that are involved in apoptosis, we analyzed microRNA and pathway databases, and cDNA expression microarrays from miR-1 transfected cells. Using qRT-PCR analysis and luciferase reporter vector assays, we found that miR-1 directly targets PTMA (prothymosin alpha). We used PTMA siRNA to down regulate PTMA mRNA levels and observed whether PTMA siRNA could induce apoptosis. Knocking down PTMA expression alone did not induce apoptosis but could accelerate apoptotic progression in cells treated with apoptosis inducers. We also found that transfection of miR-1 could up regulated some pro-apoptotic proteins (HTRA, SMAC, p53, TNF-R1, TNF-R2, TRAILR-1, TNF-alpha, TNF-beta). They are not miR-1 directly target genes but involve in miR-1 inducing apoptosis. We conclude that miR-1 can induced apoptosis in low levels of endogenous miR-1 cell lines. This is a novel model of microRNA-induced cell apoptosis. The apoptotic inducers including actinomycin D, camptothecin and etoposide are also the chemotherapeutic drugs in clinical cancer therapy and PTMA siRNA can accelerate apoptotic progression in cells treated with those apoptosis inducers. Therefore PTMA siRNA may have potential applications as an adjuvant in cancer chemotherapy.']",

        "Background":"['Prostatic carcinoma is most often a multifocal disease, with areas of localized, well-differentiated adenocarcinomas coexisting with poorly differentiated lesions within the same tumor. Mast cells (MC), classically known as the primary responders in allergic reactions, have been recently indicate of prognostic value in prostate cancer. We have evidence of a dual role of MC in prostate cancer. Within the same human tumor, MC are specifically enriched and degranulated in areas of adenocarcinoma, whereas few around anaplastic foci. This observation has been confirmed in tumors from TRAMP (Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate) mice, and in two novel tumor cells lines, derived from them, phenocopying well and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma', ' T1525 and T23, respectively. MC promote the growth of the well-differentiated adenocarcinoma T1525 that does not develop when transplanted into MC-deficient mice, or when MC degranulation is pharmacologically inhibited with sodium cromoglycate. In particular, mast cells are essential for the outgrowth of early-stage tumors due to their matrix metalloproteinase-9 production, become dispensable in advanced-stage, post-epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and are protective against neuroendocrine prostate tumor variants. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of MC in TRAMP mice results in early development of undifferentiated tumors characterized by marked anaplasia, suggesting that the growth of anaplastic clones may be antagonized by MC.Our data demonstrate that MC can influence the histotype of tumor arising from the prostate and that their targeting may change tumor outcome. As a possible corollary, MC depletion might favor the growth of more undifferentiated and aggressive variants. The common expression of c-Kit by mast cells and neuroendocrine clones suggests a possible competition for the ligand Stem Cell Factor and offers the chance of curing early-stage disease while preventing neuroendocrine tumors using c-Kit-targeted therapy.']",

Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) are used as targeted therapies for patients diagnosed with cancer with high expression of RTKs. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is highly expressed in bladder cancer as well other types of cancers and is one of the key proteins during tumorigenesis. In this study, we validated the effects of RTKIs, Masitinib (AB1010) and Axitinib on cell proliferation of human (UMUC-3 and T24) and canine (K9TCC#1Lillie, K9TCC#2Dakota, and K9TCC#5Lilly) bladder TCC cells. Using WB analysis, tested human and canine TCC cells, except T24 cells, expressed PDGFR and c-kit receptors. There was no detectable EGFR and VEGFR expressions in any of tested cells by WB analysis.

Although breast carcinomas in both genders share certain pathological features, notable differences have been observed regarding incidence, prognosis and survival. Results from microarray analyses in our studies and those of other reports were used to select 33 candidate genes to investigate in male breast carcinomas. Tumor marker results for 99 male breast cancers and 18,000 female breast carcinomas were extracted from our IRB-approved comprehensive database. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progestin receptor (PR) levels were determined by either radio-ligand binding (NEN/DuPont) or enzyme immunoassay (Abbott Labs). HER-2/neu levels were determined by either ELISA (Oncogene Science) or EIA (Triton Biosciences), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) levels were determined by an in-house radio-ligand competition assay. RNA was isolated from tissue sections of de-identified frozen biopsies from 12 male patients and 233 female patients using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and analyzed for quality and quantity (Agilent Bioanalyzer). cDNA for qPCR measurements was prepared in Tris-HCl buffer with KCl, MgCl2, DTT (Invitrogen), dNTPs (Invitrogen), RNasin (Promega) and Superscript RT III (Invitrogen). qPCR reactions were performed using Power Sybr Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), forward/reverse primers and cDNA obtained from the reverse transcription reaction. Relative gene expression was calculated by the ddCt method using -actin as a reference and Universal Human Reference RNA (Stratagene) as a calibrator. Among 99 male breast cancers, 82 were ER positive and 78 exhibited PR. Levels of ER (P = 0.013) and PR (P < 0.001) protein were greater in male breast cancers compared to biopsies from female patients, although no difference was observed in the expression of ESR1 and PGR genes that encode these receptors. In contrast, no differences were observed in either of the other conventional breast cancer biomarkers, HER-2/neu or EGFR protein, nor in patient age at diagnosis. However, there was a difference in the binding affinities (Kd value) of PR (P = 0.004) between the genders, which was not observed in ER between male and female breast cancer tissues. Furthermore, expression levels of six genes (NAT1, TBC1D9, IL6ST, RABEP1, PLK1 and LRBA) that we and others have suggested serve as indicators of risk of recurrence, were elevated in male breast cancer biopsies compared to those from female patients (P < 0.05).

Ion AmpliSeq technology introduces a groundbreaking workflow enabling the rapid sequencing of hundreds of mutations with low allele frequency using as little as 10ng of DNA per reaction. The OncoNetwork Consortium is a European collaborative effort of 8 Cancer Translational Research Institutions to evaluate a custom panel targeting hotspots mutations in 22 genes implicated in CRC and NSCLC. In particular, 7 labs will test the gene panel in 3 phases using 180 retrospective FFPE samples previously tested with orthogonal technologies, and 1 lab will perform confirmatory testing on novel SNPs. According to the established workflow, 10 ng of genomic DNA are used with a single primer pool that includes 86 pairs of primers spanning 15.7kb of targets. Individual libraries are barcoded during the ligation step, quantified and pooled 5 by 5 for amplification on spheres using the Ion OneTouch 200 Template Kit v2. Spheres are loaded on Ion 316 chip for sequencing with the Ion PGM Sequencer using the Ion PGM 200 Sequencing Kit. Results are analyzed using the Ion Reporter Software v1.2. In the first phase of the project, 7 labs received the same 5 blind, control FFPE samples. The average coverage obtained for the genes included in the panel ranged between 1.000x and 6.000x. The percentage of reads on target was 88-93% for all samples except for a sample showing a mean of 77%, with an average per base accuracy >98% for all the samples. Data analysis confirmed that all laboratories identified the expected mutations, when using a mapping quality value (MQV) of 4 as first filter. In the second phase of the project, each lab submitted to the consortium 10 previously tested CRC or NSCLC FFPE samples and received back 10 blind samples for sequencing. These samples were expected to contain 5 to 10 variants including point mutations and indels. The six labs that completed this phase were able to detect all the expected variants. Therefore, a 100% true positive rate was found in controls and blind study. The third phase of the project is ongoing and involves the assessment in each participating lab of 10 NSCLC and 5 CRC samples with a low percentage of tumor cells.

Methods', ' From a retrospective two-institutional CCC database with cases ranging from 1997 to 2015, 24 ovarian CCCs were analyzed for PIK3CAmut and MSI status and correlated with clinical outcome. A central pathology review ofHematoxylin-Eosin stained sections from tissue specimens confirmed the diagnosis of pure ovarian CCCs. MSI analysis was performed using a conventional PCR method with specific primers for NR27, NR21, NR24 BAT26 and BAT25 mononucleotidic markers and fragment analysis. The PIK3CAmut were detected by real time PCR, using COBAS platform and a specific detection kit. Results', ' Twenty-four cases were analyzed for PIK3CAmut and MSI-H, two of them were not evaluable.

        "Background":"['ENMD-2076 is a clinical stage compound with potent activity towards Aurora A and angiogenic kinases. ENMD-2076 has shown promising activity in multiple Phase 1 clinical trials, as well as in a Phase 2 trial in advanced ovarian cancer. ENMD-2076 is currently the subject of several ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials including fibrolamellar carcinoma, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), advanced/metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS), and advanced ovarian clear cell carcinomas (OCCC). ENMD-2076 has been developed to date as a single agent, however ENMD-2076 inhibits a spectrum of targets including Aurora A, FAK, CSF1R, c-Kit, and KDR, that are potentially involved in immune evasion mechanisms. These kinases have been shown in published studies, when inhibited, to enhance or augment the activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD1. A study was thereby conducted in syngeneic models to determine the utility of ENMD-2076 combined with immune checkpoint inhibition as a rational strategy for cancer therapy. The study evaluated the efficacy of ENMD-2076 administered daily by oral gavage in the MC38 and CT26 colon cancer models, alone and in combination with an anti-PD1 antibody. Xenografts were established in the appropriate mouse strain (C57BL/6 and BALBc, respectively) by the subcutaneous inoculation of MC38 or CT26 cells into the right flank of female mice. Treatment was initiated 7 days following inoculation when tumor volumes had reached a mean volume of approximately 85 mm3. All treatments were well tolerated, with no significant body weight loss seen during either study. While CT26 tumors were relatively refractory to single agent ENMD-2076, tumor regression was observed in several MC38-bearing animals suggesting an immune activating mechanism. In both models a trend was observed for an augmentation of anti-tumor response in combination relative to single agent ENMD-2076 and anti-PD1 alone. Further studies to evaluate mechanism and an assessment of re-challenge experiments in animals exhibiting complete regression of tumors will be discussed. These studies support the further evaluation of ENMD-2076 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition as a strategy for cancer therapy.']",

Currently, the anti-p63 (4A4) antibody is the most frequently used marker for the lung SCC classification. A major limitation of this antibody is low specificity due to its reactivity in a substantial proportion of lung ADCs. The p63 antibody recognizes two p63 isoforms - 1) long TAp63 isoform and 2) a truncated variant designated as p40. In contrast to the anti-p63 antibody, the anti-p40 (BC28) antibody recognizes only the p40 isoform. The goal of this study was to compare a newly optimized IHC assay using the anti-p40 (BC28) antibody and OptiView IHC DAB Detection Kit with 1) the commercially available p40 Echelon assay, and with 2) an IHC assay using the anti-p63 (4A4) antibody in various lung tumors.Methods', \" Lung tumors from 271 patients were evaluated for p40 and p63 expression using IHC on VENTANA BenchMark XT platform with OptiView detection.

In addition, the new p40 IHC assay demonstrated increased specificity compared to the anti-p63 antibody for ADC classification. 7.7% lung ADCs (13/169) were positive with anti-p63 antibody but only 3.0% (5/169) ADCs were positive with anti-p40 antibody.

        "Background":"['INTRODUCTION Serous tubal intra-epithelial carcinoma (STIC) in the fallopian tube has been proposed as a putative precursor of ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC)[1,2]. Association of STIC and HGSCs is seen in 50% of cases, and in 15% of women undergoing prophylactic removal of fallopian tubes. Clonal STIC-HGSC relationship is suggested by shared TP53 mutations and overexpression[3]. To further investigate the relationship, we applied genome-wide sequencing of same-patient STIC, HGSC and normal tube DNAs isolated from FFPE tumor specimens of 4 ovarian cancer patients. Here we report extended patterns of somatic alterations shared between STIC and HGSC and identify the affected homeostatic pathways.METHODS We established the STIC-HGSC co-occurrence by pathological evaluation and immunohistochemistry for TP53 and MKI67 positivity. Overlapping TP53 mutations were determined by Sanger sequencing. DNA was isolated from STIC, HGSC and normal tissue areas of paraffin sections, with laser-capture microdissection and whole-genome DNA amplification employed for STICs due to the small cellular content. 250 ng of DNA was converted to sequencing libraries (Kapa Biosystems kit) and exome enrichment done by SeqCap EZ System, Nimblegen, Roche. Exomes were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500 at 100x coverage in 100-bp paired-end run. Somatic mutations were analyzed by MuTect and FreeBayes callers to determine unique as well as overlapping STIC and HGSC alterations.RESULTS Deep sequencing expanded the number of shared STIC-HGSC mutations to 20-55 per patient. ETV5, LPAR4, MTOR, and PAK3 genes harbored recurrent mutations in HGSCs, and the shared STIC-HGSC mutations involved genes acting in the pathways of response to stress, regulation of apoptosis, autophagy, RAS and small GTPase-mediated signaling, and actin cytoskeleton organization (e.g. MTOR, NF1, BECN1, ARHGEF18, RASA1, PREX2, TTN). Our findings were corroborated for 80 STIC-HGSC-shared gene mutants by the cBioportal/The Cancer Genome Atlas data on ovarian serous carcinoma.CONCLUSIONS The broad patterns of somatic alterations shared by STIC and HGSC document a clonal relationship of these neoplastic lesions and possible origins of ovarian carcinomas in the tubal epithelium. We propose that our genome-wide strategy, once reproduced in a higher patient number, may facilitate future development of approaches to HGSC screening, treatment and prevention.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS IARC Regular Budget; IARC Postdoctoral Fellowship Program (supported by the European Commission FP7 Marie Curie Actions COFUND).

We set out to characterize the transcriptomes of high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC) and endometrioid carcinomas (EC), which make up around 70% and 20% of EOC tumors, respectively, and have some histopathological similarities.Methods', ' Fresh frozen tumors from EOC patients seen at the Mayo Clinic (30 EC and 62 HGSC) were used. 1ug RNA riboZero was used for library preparation using the Illumina TruSeq kit and sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 machine. Reads were aligned using TopHat2 followed by quantification of abundances using RSEM and differential expression analysis with edgeR. We analyzed transcriptomes, conducted pathway analyses, and summarized key candidate gene sets. Expressed SNVs (eSNVs) from the RNA-seq data were determined using GATK and RVboost.Results', ' The analysis found 699 genes with FDR < 110-5 for differential expression between HGSC and EC, with most genes being up-regulated in EC. The top most associated genes were TPH1, MAP2K6, KLK2, ADAM23, TESC and TRAF3IP2 (p<10-22). Pathway analysis of the genes up-regulated in EC revealed enrichment of the basal cell carcinoma signaling pathway (p = 1.210-5). Within 1 Mb of the 25 known EOC risk loci, we observed higher expression in HGSC for RSPO1 and HPSE (p <510-7). For genes functionally related to EOC, we observed in HGSC up-regulation (*p < 10-5, p<0.003) for FOXM1, CDKN2A, CCNE1*, CCND2, PIK3CA*, BRCA2, BIRC5, MMP9, FANCD2, and MAML2. In contrast, we found up-regulation in EC for MDM2*, KLK4*, BCL2, CCND1*, ANXA4*, CDH1, MMP7, and MAML3. We also identified 204 eSNVs (44 non-synonymous) associated with EC v HGSC subtype (p<10-4); this included an exonic TRAF3IP2 eSNV (66% EC, 13% HGSC, p = 410-7, chr6', '111877117).Discussion', ' Using one of the largest sets of identically processed fresh-frozen EOC tumors, some patterns emerged among the numerous EC v HGSC transcriptomic differences. TPH1, up-expressed in EC, is regulated by SOX4 which was also up-regulated in EC. Two sets of genes related to Kallikreins serine proteases were differentially expressed, including KLK2 which is known to regulate EGFR and pro-inflammatory cytokines and is regulated by MYC. Lastly, TRAF3IP2 encodes for a protein involved in regulating cytokines through members of the NFKB pathway.Conclusions', ' These findings suggest important biological insights into one of the rarer EOC histologies and may aid in the development of targeted treatment options. Research is on-going to incorporate additional features (e.g., DNA methylation, copy number) into a systems biology framework to better understand the molecular differences between EOC histologies.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Sunitinib, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is considered first-line therapy for patient with advanced renal cell carcinoma. The mechanism by which sunitinib harnesses angiogenesis is by targeting receptors of pro-angiogenic growth factors such as VEGF, PDGF and kit. Recently, it has been speculated that sunitinib may have a direct anti-tumor effect. Our previous studies have shown that tumors resistant to sunitinib still present decreased tumor vasculature compared to untreated tumors, suggesting that sunitinib anti-tumor effect may be in part independent from its anti-angiogenic effect. Hence, we wanted to further investigate the anti-tumor effect of sunitinib in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines and a patient derived clear cell RCC xenograft model. In addition, we examined the effect of sunitinib on early and late stage metastasis in a spontaneous metastatic human ccRCC model. Methods', ' Human ccRCC PDX RP-R-02 was implanted into SCID mice subcutaneously. Spontaneous metastatic ccRCC model, RP-R-02LM was developed from RP-R-02. RP-R-02LM tumor bearing mice were treated with sunitinib (40mg/kg; 5days/week). Tumor tissues and lungs were collected for immunohistochemistry analysis. In parallel, human RCC cell lines were treated in vitro with varying concentrations of sunitinib and cell viability was assessed. Results', ' Human RCC cells lines treated in vitro with sunitinib at pharmacological achievable concentrations showed a decrease in cell proliferation, suggesting a direct anti-tumor effect of sunitinib in RCC. RP-R-02LM but not parental RP-R-02 implanted either subcutaneous or orthotopically in the kidney, spontaneously metastasize to the lungs and closely mimics what is seen in the clinic. PCR results indicated that both xenografts still maintain human origin. In our in vivo system, RP-R-02LM treated with sunitinib had no anti-tumor effect on tumor at the primary site; however, we observed an inhibition of dissemination to the metastatic lung site as indicated by significantly low numbers of metastasis compared to the controls. Immunohistochemical analysis showed decrease in tumor vasculature with sunitinib treatment compared to the control, with increased tumor cell proliferations. Conclusion', ' Our studies suggest that sunitinib has a direct anti-tumor in vitro and eventually tumor cells acquire drug resistance. Our in vivo studies show that tumors resistant to sunitinib have decreased vessel density as compared to the untreated tumors, suggesting that sunitinib is still a potent anti-angiogenic agent. In addition, we show the anti-metastatic effect of sunitinib in a spontaneous metastatic human clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Overall our data suggest that sunitinib maintains an anti-metastatic effect in sunitinib resistant tumor bearing animals that is independent from its anti-angiogenic effect.']",

Thus, we chose to investigate miR-205 as a putative HNSCC oncogene and regulator of E2F1 protein expression.Methods', ' miRNAs were isolated from 29 newly diagnosed HNSCC tumors (HPV-positive', ' 14, HPV-negative', ' 15) and 4 normal mucosa samples using the PureLink RNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen). miRNA was analyzed using the ABI Megaplex protocol without pre-amplification (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were run using the miRNA Reverse Transcription Kit and Megaplex RT Human Pool A primers, then analyzed by TaqMan Low-Density Array (TLDA) cards. miRNA data was normalized to MammU6 expression, with undetectable transcripts assigned a Ct value of 40. Empirical Bayes moderated t-statistics were used to assess miRNA differential expression and the Benjamini-Hotchberg correction was applied to these p-values to account for multiple hypothesis testing. miR-205 expression was then transiently modified (Dharmacon) in an HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC cell line. These cells were characterized by Western blot and assayed for changes in proliferation utilizing two- and three-dimensional growth assays.Results', ' HNSCC miRNA expression was characterized by a general upregulation of individual transcripts and miRNA families compared to normal mucosa. This difference in expression was independent of HPV-status, with only two miRNAs demonstrating differential expression between HPV-positive and -negative tumors', ' miR-449a and miR-129-3p. miR-205, a transcript upregulated in both subtypes, was able to modulate proliferation and E2F1 expression levels in 93VU147T (HPV+), but not UM-SCC-15 (HPV-). Further Western blot analysis concluded modulations in Rb-phosphorylation status and apoptotic signaling factors may explain these E2F1-mediated effects. Conclusions', ' While significant differences are evident in the miRNA profiles of HNSCC compared to normal mucosa, a striking degree of similarity exists between HPV-positive and -negative miRNA deregulation. A functional evaluation of miR-205 determined this transcript is capable of modulating HNSCC growth in the genetic context of p16 expression and proapoptotic signaling.']",

The constant release of cell free DNA (cfDNA) from tumor cells into the peripheral blood stream may provide a valuable source for detection of cancer associated somatic copy number variations and mutations. The aim of this project was to evaluate the feasibility of detecting clinically relevant genomic alterations in mUC by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of circulating cfDNA. Methods', ' Peripheral blood (20ml) was collected from 15 patients with mUC before chemotherapy. Plasma cfDNA was isolated using the QIAAmp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit. Germline control DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using the DNEasy Kit (Qiagen). We performed deep (>500X) targeted DNA sequencing on cfDNA and germline DNA using a custom NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Choice Library and Illumina sequencers. Our custom panel included 50 bladder cancer-relevant genes, including key tumor suppressors (e.g. TP53, RB1, CDKN2A), cell cycle drivers (e.g. CCND1, CCNE1), DNA repair genes (e.g. ATM, BAP1, ERCC2), PI3K pathway genes (e.g. PIK3CA, PTEN, AKT1), and other oncogenic pathways (e.g. RAS/RAF, EGFR, ERBB2, PPARG, FGFR3). Results', ' Somatic mutations and/or copy number changes were detected in 14/15 samples, with a median variant allele frequency >5%. The overall mutational landscape was highly consistent with bladder cancer, including mutations in TP53 and ARID1A (and other chromatin modifiers), as well as hotspot activating mutations in PIK3CA. Typical copy number changes, including focal amplifications of ERBB2, KRAS, and CCNE1 were detected. We identified complex gene rearrangements, including an activating FGFR3 fusion in one case. Extended analyses with a larger patient population are currently pending. Conclusions', ' Non-invasive characterization of genomic changes in peripheral blood of patients with mUC using NGS of plasma cfDNA is feasible in a high proportion of patients. Analysis of cfDNA might therefore provide an improved understanding of genomic changes in mUC and could be developed as a biomarker to help guide the use of targeted therapies.']",

Patient demographics, length of treatment, response, RBC mean cell volume (MCV) indices, and known causes of macrocytosis including B12 and folate deficiency and hypothyroidism were examined. Results', ' Median duration of treatment was 6 months (range 0-30). 38 (51%) have died. 24 (32%) received 2 or less cycles of treatment with the majority stopping due to early progression or death. 30 patients (41%) developed macrocytosis on treatment, but a trend to macrocytosis was identified in most patients positively correlating to time on treatment. 26 (87%) had a macrocytic anaemia.

Tumor Growth Factor- (TGF-) is a potent tumor suppressor via its SMAD2/3 signaling axis; its inactivation has been implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis. Paradoxically, TGF- serum concentrations are elevated in patients with advanced HCC. The TGF- receptor is currently explored in clinical trials as a therapeutic target. However, the mechanisms mediating the functional switch of the TGF- pathway to an oncogenic role in advanced HCC are unknown.Material and Methods', ' Gene expression profiling of human HCC was performed using the Oncomine database. Immunohistochemical analysis of human HCC samples was performed using Tissue Micro Arrays. Established human HCC cell lines were used for in vitro studies. Gene expression was assessed by qRT-PCR, ELISA and immunoblot analyses. shRNA was used for gene silencing. Cell cycle analysis was performed by FACS. Cell proliferation was assessed by microscopic quantification, MTS- and BrdU-assay. Apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL assay and DAPI. Migration was evaluated by wound assay, and invasion by Boyden Chamber assay.Results', ' In human HCC, SMAD2 overexpression and decreased expression of the negative TGF-/SMAD regulator SKI was correlated to shortened survival. Intranuclear pSer465/467-SMAD2 was identified in up to 65% of human HCC tumors, and correlated with TNM-stage, survival and pTyr705STAT3. In 50% of human HCC cell lines, the TGF-/SMAD2 axis was functional. Exclusively in HCC cells with intact SMAD-signaling, TGF- induced STAT3 Tyr705-phosporylation and nuclear translocation. We show that TGF-1 transcriptionally regulates expression of the c-KIT ligand Stem Cell Factor (SCF). SCF is overexpressed in advanced HCC tumors, and correlated to pSMAD2, metastases and decreased survival. In human HCC cells, SCF activates STAT3 via auto- and paracrine stimulation of its cognate receptor c-KIT. TGF-1-induced activation of STAT3 is inhibited by SCF-knockdown, inhibition of c-KIT or JAK1. The TGF-1/STAT3 axis neutralizes the cell cycle inhibitory function of TGF- in human HCC cell lines, and instead promotes EMT, tumor cell migration and invasion. Disruption of the TGF-/STAT3 signaling axis inhibits its tumor promoting effects and restores TGF- antiproliferative effects.Conclusion', ' In advanced HCC, TGF-/SMAD2-signaling is constitutively activated and correlated to worse outcomes. The functional switch of TGF- is mediated through aberrant expression of SCF with subsequent stimulation of the c-KIT/STAT3 signaling axis. Disruption of this axis restores TGF- tumor suppressor function. Disruption of the molecular network between TGF-1/SMAD2 and SCF/STAT3 constitutes a novel therapeutic strategy aiming at restoration of a dysregulated tumor suppressor.']",

Pathogenic mutations in HER2/neu and EGFR were rare. Although c-Kit and c-Met receptor kinases were more frequently overexpressed in bladder than in non-bladder cancers (10% vs. 6% and 25% vs. 8%, respectively), activating mutations were also rare. PIK3CA and/or PTEN mutations were more frequently observed in non-bladder (27%) than in bladder UCs (21%). Non-bladder UC harbored high FGFR3 gene mutation (33%), which was not observed in any of the UC of the bladder (p=0.02). TP53 gene mutations were frequently identified in both bladder and in non-bladder cancers (49% vs. 27%, respectively, p=0.15), while KRAS was frequently mutated in the bladder adenocarcinomas (56%, p<0.001).

Using an immunoassay, a small study indicated comparable sensitivity for CA 125 and HE4 in postmenopausal women with ovarian cancer. A subsequent and larger study confirmed the sensitivity of HE4. We investigated the possibility of HE4 to predict survival for patients with EOC. Methods', \" In the present study we measured serum concentration of HE4 in 35 patients with surgically diagnosed EOC since December 2008 until May 2010. All patients received the same standard of care using an integrative model combining surgery, and chemotherapy as appropriate. Of 35 pts. 28 had stage III disease at diagnosis, and 7 stage IV. Blood samples were obtained before surgery, at each IV chemotherapy cycle and every 3 months. The Kaplan-Meier or product-limit method was used to calculate survival.Serum levels of HE4 were determined using assays and kits developed by Fujirebio Diagnostic, Inc. and were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications. Results\", ' At the time of this analysis (December 2010), 7 patients had expired and 18 were censored. The median age at presentation was 54.2 years (range 38.1 - 73.5 years). At baseline (study entry) no patients had low serum HE4 levels (<100 pM). After 3 cycles of planned chemotherapy, 20 pts had lower serum HE4 levels (<100pM) and 15 had high serum HE4 levels (>100pM); at the end of 6 planned cycles 28 pts had lower serum HE4 levels (<100pM) and 7 had yet high serum HE4 levels (>100pM). All pts with a HE4 plasma level > 400pM at the end of the planned treatment died before December 2010. Patients with a reduced HE4 at both baseline and 3 months had the best overall survival. Conclusions', ' Our data show that HE4 can improve the monitoring of treatment response and disease progression. Reduction in HE4 after 3 or within the 6 planned cycles of chemotherapy is clearly associated with better overall survival in EOC. Patients with a HE4 plasma level >400pM at the end of chemotherapy have a particularly poor prognosis and could be immediately submitted to different chemotherapy regimens or be enrolled in perspective controlled clinical trials.']",

The telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter is recurrently mutated at high frequency in UC (50%). These mutations have been correlated with tumor recurrence and survival. Tumor cell-free DNA (cfDNA) with somatic genomic alterations can be found in the plasma of cancer patients and has the potential for use as a non-invasive cancer biomarker. Detection of TERT promoter mutations in cfDNA might be used as a prognostic tool to monitor disease outcome in UC patients. We set out to detect tumor cfDNA and TERT promoter mutations in cfDNA from patients with UC at different stages. Methods', ' UC patients receiving chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, first or second-line metastatic setting had blood collected either before or during therapy. cfDNA was isolated from ~1ml plasma samples using the QIAmp (Qiagen) kit. Samples underwent ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing (ULP-WGS) to determine whether tumor cfDNA could be detected in these samples. TERT promoter mutations were detected using a sensitive qPCR assay. Results', ' 40 plasma samples from a total of 32 patients with urothelial carcinoma were analyzed. Sufficient amounts of plasma cfDNA were obtained for library construction and ULP-WGS in 11 patients. 6 of these 11 patients were determined to be positive for detectable tumor cfDNA and of these, all were metastatic and 50% (3/6) were positive for a TERT promoter mutation. In total, 8 out of 40 samples (20%) were positive for a TERT promoter mutation, including samples from two patients where total cfDNA yield was insufficient for library construction. A total of ~20% of patients with metastatic disease were positive for TERT promoter mutations in cfDNA. The low percentage of samples having sufficient cfDNA most likely reflects the low volume of plasma used. Conclusions', 'TERT promoter mutations were identified in cfDNA of UC patients. ULP-WGS showed tumor cfDNA in patients with a high tumor burden and metastatic disease. TERTpromoter mutations in cfDNA could potentially be used as a non-invasive method for detection of disease.

The expressions of Dkk1 seem to be tumor-specific', \" reduced expressions have been seen in colorectal cancer, but elevated levels were reported for hepatoblastomas. In ESCC, the situation is less clear, for both elevation and reduction of Dkk1 were reported. The serum concentrations of Dkk1 have also been shown to be higher in ESCC patients' sera in one study. In view of the varied outcome from Dkk1 tissue expressions and the scarce reports on Dkk1 serum concentration from ESCC patients, we therefore sought to determine the tissue expression and serum concentrations of Dkk1 as our first step to evaluate the potential of Dkk1 as a diagnostic marker for ESCC. Methods\", ' The expression levels of Dkk1 in ten ESCC tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues were examined by Western blot.

The aim of this study was to investigate the genealogy and clonal relationship between these cancer locations.METHODSCancer cell nuclei derived from formalin fixed tumor specimens were processed and sorted based on DNA content with a BD Influx FACS. DNA from sorted aneuploid populations was analyzed by whole genome high resolution CGH microarrays (aCGH). In addition, short tandem repeat (STR) analyses were done with the PowerPlex ESI Kit commercial testing kit. Each run was performed on an Applied Biosystems Genetic Analyzer 3500 and analyzed with the GeneMapper ID-X Software. Integration of PV-genom was investigated by RT-PCR. The IonTorrent platform by LifeTech (PGM, IonAmpliseq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2) was used for next-generation-sequencing (NGS).RESULTSArray CGH clarified that the primary two non-muscle invasive bladder tumors differed completely from each other and from the subsequent cancer tissues. The tumor manifestations 10 years after NTx shared the same genomic profile, except for a private amplification at 6p12.3 and a private deletion at Xp22.33 - Xp22.11, both in the bladder tumor. STR identified all three tumors diagnosed 10 years after NTx to originate from the allograft donor.

Addiction of melanoma to the MAPK pathways led to the development of inhibitors targeting either mutant BRAF, such as Vemurafenib (PLX4032), or MEK. Melanoma treatment recently met a breakthrough with the clinical evaluation of Vemurafenib that demonstrated an unprecedented 80% response rate among patients with BRAF V600E melanomas treated with Vemurafenib, but rapidly limited by drug resistance, which still requires to be elucidated.The MAPK pathway regulates the expression of many genes which can mediate therapeutic response but also resistance, such as RhoGTPases. We analysed the mRNA expression of the RhoGTPases in two BRAF mutated melanoma cell lines, WM266-4 and A375, in response to inhibition of the MAPK pathway by PLX4032. We observed that the mRNA of RhoB was increased by PLX4032 treatment. This result was confirmed in many other BRAF mutated melanoma cell lines by inhibition of the MAPK pathway with BRAF inhibitors (PLX4032 or SB-590885) as well as MEK inhibitors (AZD6244 or AS703026). MEK inhibitors (AZD6244 or AS703026) upregulate RhoB in BRAF wild-type melanoma cells harbouring N-Ras, K-Ras or c-KIT mutation suggesting that inhibiting MAPK pathway is critical for RhoB expression modulation. It is noteworthy that this modulation is cell type dependent, while it was not found in BRAF mutated non-melanoma cells as colon carcinoma cells (Colo205 and RKO).To investigate the role of RhoB induction in cellular responses to BRAF and MEK inhibitors, the RhoB induction was suppressed using RNA interference. The cells treated with siRNA targeting RhoB, WM266-4 and A375 cells, were more sensitive to PLX4032 and AZD6244. Moreover the blockade of RhoB induction led to a significant increase of PLX4032-induced apoptosis as shown by the increase of the subG1 population and PARP cleavage.Our findings show that RhoB upregulation is involved in PLX4032 response and both inhibitions of MAPK pathway and RhoB expression trigger cell death and should prompt a search for agents. Indeed co-targeting MAPK and RhoB pathways, could lead to a synthetic lethality and prevent resistance to either BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Ongoing work focuses on confirming this role in tumour-xenografted mouse models.']",

Here we explored the expression of CSC markers CD90 and EpCAM in primary HCCs and cell lines to investigate the molecular characteristics of each cell type. Gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry analyses were used to characterize 340 surgically resected HCC tissues and 11 advanced HCC tissues with distant organ metastasis obtained from autopsy. Magnetic-activated cell sorting was used to isolate EpCAM+ or CD90+ cells from surgically resected 12 fresh HCC specimens, which were tested for hepatic stem cell properties including their tumor initiating capacity in NOD/SCID mice. In primary HCC, EpCAM+ and CD90+ cells resided distinctively, and gene expression analysis of sorted cells suggested that EpCAM+ cells had the features of epithelial stem cells whereas CD90+ cells had those of vascular endothelial cells. Clinicopathological analysis indicated that presence of EpCAM+ cells was associated with poorly differentiated morphology and high serum AFP with a tendency of portal vein invasion, while the presence of CD90+ cells was associated with high incidence of distant organ metastasis within two years after surgical resection and advanced TNM stages. Serial xenotransplantation of EpCAM+/CD90+ cells in NOD/SCID mice revealed the rapid growth of EpCAM+ cells in the subcutaneous lesion and highly metastatic capacity of CD90+ cells into the lung. Xenotransplantation experiments of cell lines further demonstrated that EpCAM+ cells had the features of hepatic CSCs with marked tumorigenic capacity whereas CD90+ cells had those of vascular endothelial cells with highly metastatic features. Markedly, CD90+ cells showed the abundant expression of c-Kit and VEGFR1 and chemosensitivity to imatinib methylate (c-Kit inhibitor) and axitinib (VEGFR1/2 inhibitor). Taken together, our data strongly suggest the discrete natures of EpCAM+ and CD90+ cells with specific gene expression patterns and chemosensitivity to the molecularly targeted therapy.

Methods', '  We examined serum anti-p53 antibody levels in 79 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 384 patients with primary invasive breast cancer without distant metastasis (PIBC) and 59 patients with distant metastatic breast cancer (MBC), using an ELISA kit. We also studied the correlation between circulating levels of anti-p53 antibody and clinicopathological factors.  Results', '  Median levels of anti-p53 is 0.40 U/ml (range; 0  4.3) in 205 healthy controls. Cut-off levels of anti-p53 were previously defined 1.3 U/ml. The elevated levels of anti-p53 were detected in 10 (12.6%) of 79 patients with DCIS, 63 (16.4%) of 384 patients with PIBC, 16 (27.1%) of 59 patients with MBC. Increased levels of anti-p53 were correlated with premenopausal patients (p=0.0003) and triple negative subtype (p=0.0364). Detection rates of breast cancer using CA15-3, CEA and anti-p53 antibody were 9.3%, 20.1% and 17.1%. Serum levels of anti-p53 antibody were not correlated those of CA15-3 and CEA although serum levels of CA15-3 is significantly correlated with those of CEA (p=0.0001).  Conclusions', '  These findings suggest serum anti-p53 antibody may detect breast cancer not detected by CA15-3 and CEA such as triple negative subtype.']",

The major targets of regorafenib are membrane-bound and intracellular kinases including RET, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, KIT, PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta, FGFR1, FGFR2, TIE2, DDR2, Trk2A, Eph2A, RAF-1, BRAF, BRAFV600E, SAPK2, PTK5, and Abl pathways. In HCC, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a key transcription factor involving in cell proliferation and survival in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, Targeting STAT3 by small molecule is a promising strategy in HCC therapy. Methods', ' We have designed and synthesized a series of regorafenib analogues without kinase inhibitory activity. These compounds are treated with and analyzed in terms of STAT3 activity in HCC cell lines. Also, Effects of regorafenib analogues induced cell death are evaluated. Results', ' We demonstrate that regorafenib and its analogues repress STAT3 phosphorylation, subsequently abrogate STAT3-regulated protein, Mcl-1 and cyclin D1 and further induce apoptosis in HCC cells. Overexpression of STAT3 in PLC-5 cells attenuates apoptotic effect with regorafenib and its analogues treatment, suggesting STAT3, at least, is a major target. Interestingly, the new analugues of regorafenib are devoid of kinase inhibitory activity which implies the involvement of other regulation factors. The activity of negative regulator of STAT3, such as protein tyrosine phosphatases, is under investigation. In summary, the new analogues provide a lead for the design of a new class of agents that inhibit STAT3 along and synergize with clinical drugs in HCC.(Supported by NSC 100-2325-B-010-007)']",

Fibroblast growth factor receptor-type 1 (FGFR1) may play a role in the pathogenesis of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and amplification of the FGFR1 gene is considered a candidate target for treatment of LSCC. The aim of this study was to simultaneously explore copy number changes of FGFR1 and 23 other genes by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), to compare the results with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) data, and determine the clinicopathological significance of gene amplification.Methods', ' This study included 81 resected LSCC specimens obtained between 2008 and 2010, and 14 lung cancer cell lines.

        "Background":"['Our labs have observed decreased proliferation of several cultured head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines when treated with rosmarinic acid or blue light. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the combination therapy would be more effective than either treatment alone, and to further characterize the cellular mechanisms responsible for these effects.UM-SCC-6 oral squamous carcinoma cells were cultured in 24- or 96-well plates, and cells were exposed to blue light delivered from a Quartz-tungsten-halogen dental curing lamp (500 mW/cm2) for 90 or 120 sec, followed 1 h later by the addition of 80 g/ml rosmarinic acid. Cell number was assessed at 24h using a WST-1 cell proliferation assay and cell migration was measured with an Oris Universal Migration Assay Kit. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was quantified with each single treatment and combination using the CM-H2DCFH-DA assay. Western blot analysis was used to monitor changes in levels of cell signaling proteins known to be affected by each single treatment including phosphoAKT (pAKT) and AKT, NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and GAPDH (as a loading control).As hypothesized, the combination of rosmarinic acid and blue light was more effective in reducing cell proliferation and migration than either single treatment alone. Both treatments also produced an early increase in ROS. Treatment with blue light significantly increased pAKT while rosmarinic acid decreased AKT activation. However, both treatments increased levels of Nrf2 and its downstream target, HO-1.In order for the transcription factor NRF2 to translocate to the nucleus it needs to be stabilized and activated. AKT is an upstream kinase that is a known activator of NRF2 in response to an increase in ROS. Nuclear NRF2 binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) within the promoters for phase II detoxifying/antioxidant genes, including that of HO-1. This signaling cascade has been shown to lead to anti-proliferative functions. Our results suggest that blue light induces this pathway by transiently increasing ROS that then significantly activates AKT. Subsequent NRF2 activation leads to increased levels of HO-1. Rosmarinic acid appears to use a different mechanism to upregulate NRF2 due to its downregulation of AKT. Importantly, both treatments activate NRF2, resulting in induction of antioxidant protein expression and ultimately decreasing ROS needed to promote tumor cell growth. This combination therapy may prove to be a useful, non-invasive treatment for HNSCC.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Impact of honokiol on sialylation in breast cancer cells",
        "Background":"['Metastasis is a process in which malignant cells spread form the tumor of origin and colonize at distant organs. One of the diagnostic markers of metastatic progression is the overexpression of a transmembrane protein called Mucin 1 (MUC1). High levels of MUC1 have been found in tumor tissues, including breast cancer, and have been implicated in reduced survival rate. After translation of the protein, carbohydrate groups are attached to MUC1, a process called glycosylation. The resulting glycocalyx, which serves as a protective layer on epithelial surfaces, is involved in cell-cell interactions, signaling and metastasis. Glycosylation patterns differ on MUC1 in normal breast tissue in comparison with MUC1 in breast tumors. Not only do breast tumors have simpler and fewer carbohydrate chains than MUC1 from normal breast epithelial tissue, they also have increased levels of the carbohydrate derivative, sialic acid. Altered addition of sialic acid (sialylation) has been associated with cancer transformation and metastatic progression of the disease. The enzyme, -2,3 sialyltransferase (ST3Gal I) which adds the -2,3-linked sialic acids to MUC1 is increased in breast tumors and has been correlated with poor prognosis. Shortening of the carbohydrates units on MUC1 in breast tumors unmasks peptides that would otherwise be covered by the carbohydrates in normal MUC1, and current studies seek to identify antibodies that would directly target MUC1 on the cancer cells and in turn prevent cancer metastasis. Plant derived natural product honokiol is being studied for its anti-tumor activities. To assess the effect of honokiol on ST3Gal I, we treated breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells with honokiol and analyzed its effect on ST3Gal I mRNA and protein expression using RT-PCR and Western Blotting, respectively. Honokiol suppressed ST3Gal I at the mRNA and protein level in both cancer cell lines. To investigate specifically whether honokiol reduces free sialic acid, we treated mammary carcinoma cells with honokiol and using the Sialic Acid Kit, we observed reduction in sialic acid in honokiol-treated mammary carcinoma cells. Future immunoprecipitation studies are underway to investigate specifically whether honokiol suppresses sialylation of MUC1. We propose that these studies will lead to the understanding on how sialylation of MUC1 alters the cellular signaling processes involved in the transformation of breast cancer and eventually to the spread of the disease.']",

        "Background":"['Natural killer (NK) cells of the immune system are the first line of defense against transformed and infected cells. NK cell action is determined through binding of killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) with specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I ligands on target cells. The KIR gene family is diverse and highly polymorphic, is poorly covered on GWAS platforms, and exhibits significant functional copy number variation. The KIR locus has been primarily studied in the context of HCV, HIV, and transplant outcomes. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that KIR genotypes are associated with Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC) etiology. These are among the most prevalent malignancies worldwide with rising incidence. In addition, they are highly antigenic tumors, with a possible viral etiology, making NMSC an ideal model to test KIR as a cancer susceptibility trait. A random subset of a population-based case-control study in New Hampshire was selected for the study', ' 422 basal cell carcinomas (BCC) (1 BCC=243, 2 BCC=131, 3 BCC=48), 132 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and 222 controls.

For SCC, the KIR3DL1 gene was associated with a significantly increased risk of malignancy (OR=3.73, 95% CI', ' 1.51-9.22). Next we investigated the association of KIR and SCC within HPV strata. The KIR3DL1-SCC association was strongest among those with no evidence of HPV infection (OR=6.81, 95% CI', ' 1.78-26.12). In contrast, the non-functional KIR2DS4 variant related to an increased risk and the KIR2DL2 gene related to reduced risk of SCC among those with multiple -HPV infections. Our results implicate a strong role for KIR in the etiology of NMSC. KIR2DL2/3 may be particularly important in the development of multiple BCC, and KIR3DL1 in the pathogenesis of SCC. Finally, we identified a pattern of KIR-SCC associations that supports a potential etiologic role of cutaneous HPV in SCC occurrence.']",
