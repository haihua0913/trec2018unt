In-vitro studies suggest that loss of PTEN expression and resulting PI3K pathway activation drive cholesterol ester accumulation in aggressive prostate cancers through sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and acyl coenzyme A-cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT1) activity. In two prospective cohorts, we studied whether lower PTEN expression is associated with cholesterol metabolism and how this relates to lethal prostate cancer.METHODS', ' We analyzed men with prostate cancer from the prospective prostatectomy Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Physicians Health Study. 105 men had lethal cancer and 284 men non-lethal disease without metastases at 8 years of follow-up. Whole-transcriptome mRNA expression profiling data was available from diagnostic prostate tumor specimens. Linear regression models were used to assess continuous and categorical associations, and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of lethal prostate cancer.RESULTS', ' Both lower PTEN and higher SQLE expression were associated with higher Gleason grade (p trend < 0.001 each).

SREBF2 was correlated with SQLE (r = 0.33, p < 0.001) but not with ACAT1 (r = -0.01, p = 0.8). Low PTEN was associated with lethal cancer (OR, 1.50 per 1 standard deviation [SD] decrease; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.87; p = 0.001). High SQLE was associated with lethal cancer (OR 2.13 per 1 SD increase, 95% CI, 1.63 to 2.79; p < 0.001). SREBF1, SREBF2, and ACAT1 were not associated with lethal cancer (all p > 0.05).

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Chemokines are a family of cytokines known to regulate the migration of cells. The chemokine CXCL12, also known as SDF-1, and its receptor CXCR4 are associated with prostate cancer bone metastasis. The tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) is a critical regulator of growth factors and inhibitor of PI3K. Loss of PTEN is frequently observed in cancer, resulting in the deregulation of cell survival, growth, and proliferation. Previous studies have found that PTEN is lost or mutated in 30-80% of primary prostate cancer, and 50% of prostate cancer bone metastases. In mouse models of prostate cancer, it has been shown that loss of PTEN is critical for tumor initiation, and the level of PTEN expression is inversely associated with prostate tumorigenesis. Murine epithelial cells from PTEN-deficient prostate tumors also display increased expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12. We hypothesize that loss of PTEN and subsequent activation of Akt, frequent occurrences in prostate cancer, regulate the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis in prostate cancer progression.Methods', ' Prostate-specific deletion of floxed exon 5 of PTEN was achieved by Cre recombinase expressed under the control of an androgen-responsive probasin promoter. Stable cell lines were developed from PTEN+/+, PTEN+/, and PTEN/ murine prostate epithelial cells isolated from prostates of corresponding mice at 8 weeks of age. PTEN status in these cell lines was confirmed by genotyping and immunoblot analyses. Human prostate cancer cell lines BPH-1, C4-2B, PC3, and DU145 were also utilized. Gene expression and invasion were analyzed in the presence or absence of Akt inhibitor. Additionally, DU145 with overexpressed HA-tagged Akt1 was also utilized in a subcutaneous injection model.Results', ' Loss of PTEN resulted in increased expression of CXCR4 and CXCL12, suggesting that loss of PTEN may play a key role in the regulation of these chemokines in prostate cancer. Upon treatment of PTEN-null cells with Akt inhibitor, the induction of CXCL12/CXCR4 was reversed, further demonstrating the role of the PTEN regulated pathway in the expression of these genes. Akt inhibition also resulted in decreased invasion in response to CXCL12. Overexpression of Akt1 in DU145 resulted increased CXCR4 expression, as well as increased proliferation and cell cycle progression. Subcutaneous injection of these cells also resulted in increased tumor growth as compared to neo controls.Conclusions', ' These results suggest the basis for activation of CXCL12 signaling through CXCR4 in prostate cancer driven by the loss of PTEN and subsequent activation of Akt.']",

In this study, we demonstrate that Pten-depleted cells suffer from mitotic stress, and that nuclear function of Pten, but not its phosphastase activity, is required to reverse this stress phenotype. Further, depletion of Pten results in elevated expression of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a key regulator of the cell cycle. We found that elevated Plk1 is critical for Pten-depleted cells to adapt to mitotic stress for survival, and that re-introduction of wild-type Pten into Pten-null prostate cancer cells reduces the survival dependence on Plk1. We further show that Plk1 confers the tumorigenic competence of Pten-deleted prostate cancer cells in a mouse xenograft model. In order to evaluate the clinical relevance of our finding, we examined the expression level of Plk1 in human prostate cancer tissue assay which includes normal tissue samples, prostate hyperplasia samples and malignant tumor samples. A correlation between overexpression of Plk1 and genetic inactivation of Pten was observed during prostate neoplasia formation.

In this study, we demonstrate that SOX4 is critical for PTEN-mediated prostate cancer progression in vivo. We show that homozygous deletion of Sox4 in the adult prostate epithelium strongly inhibits tumor progression initiated by homozygous loss of the Pten tumor suppressor, demonstrating the key role of SOX4 in the development of prostate cancer. Homozygous deletion of Sox4 also reduces the activation of AKT and -catenin in Pten-null mice, resulting in inhibition of an invasive cancer phenotype. We also show that SOX4 expression is induced by loss of PTEN, and that PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling activity is critical for SOX4 expression, suggesting a positive feedback loop between SOX4 protein and PI3K-AKT-mTOR activity.

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men. Protein kinase C epsilon (PKC), a member of the PKC family of phorbol ester/diacylglycerol receptors, has been shown to be up-regulated in human prostate cancer specimens. We recently demonstrated that mice that specifically overexpress PKC in prostate under the control of the probasin promoter (PB-PKC) develop hyperplasia and PIN lesions. However, PKC overexpression was insufficient to drive neoplastic changes in the mouse prostate. In the present study our goal was to determine whether PKC overexpression can cooperate with Pten deficiency, one of the most common genetic alterations in human prostate cancer. We stably overexpressed PKC in two pairs of isogenic mouse prostate epithelial lines that are either heterozygous (P2, P8) or homozygous (CaP2, CaP8) for Pten deletion. PKC overexpression led to significant enhancement in cell proliferation compared to the respective control cells and this effect is more pronounced in CaP2 or CaP8 cells. Moreover, assays of colony formation in liquid medium revealed that anchorage-dependent growth was augmented in PKC-overexpressing cells relative to control cells. A significant elevation in phospho-Akt levels was observed in PKC overexpressing cells relative to respective controls. To further elucidate the cooperativity between PKC overexpression and Pten loss we intercrossed the PB-PKC transgenic mice and Pten+/ mice. Strikingly, the resulting compound mutant mice overexpressing PKC and haploinsufficient for Pten (PB-PKC; Pten+/) developed fully invasive adenocarcinoma at 12 months of age. Very strong phospho-Akt, phospho-S6 and phospho mTOR staining could be detected in adenocarcinomas from PB-PKC; Pten+/ mice. Furthermore, we detected enhanced p-Erk, Cox-2, STAT3, NF-B and cyclin D1 signaling in adenocarcinomas from PB-PKC;Pten+/ mice than in lesions from each monogenic model. These data thus suggest that PKC overexpression cooperates with a defined oncogenic input to promote prostate tumorigenesis. These findings also suggest a crucial role of PKC in survival.']",

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer affects one in three men over the age of 60. Loss of expression or function of PTEN is the most commonly observed molecular defect in human prostate cancer. Thirty to 70% of clinical cases exhibit loss of this critical tumor suppressor. PTEN is an essential negative regulator of PI3K/Akt signaling. Together with the mTOR pathway, the PTEN/PI3K/Akt cascade forms a network for cellular responses to growth factors and nutrients. Studies in mice have demonstrated that small changes in PTEN dose can influence cancer development. Thus, understanding the regulation of PTEN expression and function is key to understanding tumor progression. We have previously reported that signaling through the Notch-1 receptor pathway results in increased transcriptional expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN. We further reported that Notch-1 signaling was lost in the tumor foci of clinical prostate cancer cases as compared to the surrounding benign tissue. Herein, we report that Notch-1 signaling alters the pool of active, unphosphorylated PTEN in the human metastatic prostate tumor cell line DU145. Retroviral transduction was used to generate DU145 cells that express constitutively active Notch-1 (DU/ICN1). In cells with constitutively active Notch-1 (DU/ICN1), the pool of unphosphorylated PTEN was increased roughly 2.5 fold compared to the vector only control. Constitutive Notch-1 signaling also resulted in decreased mTOR signaling as determined by a decrease in phosphorlyated 4E-BP1 and phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein. Decreased expression of Raptor and Rictor and decreased phosphorylation of mTOR were also observed in the presence of constitutively active Notch-1. To test if Notch-1 signaling influences tumor engraftment and growth in a syngeneic model, the tumorigenic C2 cell line, derived from TRAMP mice, was transduced with constitutively active Notch-1. C2/ICN1 and parental C2 cells were engrafted into C57/BL6 mice. All recipients of the parental C2 cell line developed tumors within 46 days, whereas none that received cells expressing constitutively active Notch-1 (C2/ICN1) had developed tumors. Only after 61 days did one of the four mice that received C2/ICN1 cells develop tumors. We next tested if loss of Notch-1 expression promotes characteristics associated with tumorigenicity by using lentiviral transduction to knock down endogenous Notch-1 expression in DU145 cells (DU/shN1). DU145 cells with loss of Notch-1 (DU/shN1) exhibited decreased expression of PTEN protein and a decreased ability to migrate in transwell experiments as compared with control cells expressing endogenous Notch-1. Collectively, these data indicate a role for Notch-1 receptor signaling in modulating the activity of PI3K/Akt and mTOR axis through regulation of the PTEN tumor suppressor, and suggest a mechanistic basis for Notch-1 tumor suppressive activity in prostate cells.']",

In the present study, ATM and PTEN immunoexpression were investigated using a tissue microarray (TMA) containing 149 canine prostatic paraffin-embedded lesions (BPH, PIA and PCa) collected from 67 animals. Immunohistochemical reactions were performed using the polyclonal rabbit antibody anti-PTEN (Santa Cruz Biotech, 1', '50) and anti-ATM (Abcam, 1', '50).

Therefore, the prostate-specific PTEN-deletion driven prostate cancer mouse model resembles many features of human prostate cancer including disease progression to metastasis. Due to its high clinical relevance, this model is gaining wider utility for prostate cancer chemoprevention and therapeutic studies. Very recently, our collaborative team found that oral administration of methylseleninic acid (MSeA), a second-generation selenium compound, significantly inhibited PTEN-loss driven prostate tumorigenesis in vivo. In particular, the efficacy was associated with a super-activation of p53-p21 senescence pathway (PTEN-loss induced cellular senescence, PICS). To gain insights into additional molecular targets, we profiled the prostate proteome of PTEN-deletion mice. Whole prostates from PTEN-deletion mice (12-15 weeks of age) and their wild type littermate were obtained from the NCI Mouse Model Repository. Homogenate from 4 prostate pairs (Pten/ and wild type) was prepared and digested individually and the peptides were labeled with 8-plex iTRAQTM reagents. Labeled peptides were pooled and analyzed by 2D-LC-MS/MS (LTQ Orbitrap Velos, Thermo Scientific). Out of 949 proteins identified, we further analyzed 152, the expressions of which were significantly and concordantly changed in all four pairs of mice. Among them, we detected enrichment of proteins related to cellular senescence (chitinase-3 like protein3 [CH3L3], cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide [Camp]), p53 (S100-A8, sorbitol dehydrogenase [DHSO]) and molecular targets involved in AKT signaling pathway (lipocalin 2, CH3L3), in line with the well-described AKT driven p53-mediated senescence in Pten-deficient prostate cancer mouse model. We also found decreased protein expression of GRP78 (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein), endoplasmin, probasin and TGM4 (transglutaminase4), same as we reported in the TRAMP model. Some of these protein changes (over or under) were predicated by published changes of their mRNA levels in prostates (probasin, TGM4, etc) and/or protein levels in sera (probasin, endoplasmin, GRP78, etc).

When the cancer enters into the metastatic castration resistant stage (mCRPC), few treatment options are currently available and the disease is considered incurable. The purpose of this study is to investigate a new, targeted therapy against prostate cancers, including mCRPC. Talazoparib is a novel PARP inhibitor with up to 100-fold higher potency and PARP affinity when compared to PARP inhibitors such as olaparib, veliparib, and rucaparib. Current literature suggests that PTEN mutants have high sensitivity to talazoparib. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that is commonly lost in prostate cancers. A murine prostate cancer cell line, Myc-CaP, which has been modified to overexpress the oncogene Myc, was edited by the CRISPR-Cas9 system to knock out the PTEN gene. Myc-CaP and Myc-CaP PTEN KO cells were treated with olaparib, an FDA approved, first generation PARP inhibitor, and talazoparib. Talazoparib decreased cell viability significantly more in PTEN KO cells versus PTEN wild-type (WT) cells. No such trend was observed when these cells were treated with olaparib. In addition, IC50 values in prostate cancer cell lines with heterozygous or homozygous deletion of PTEN were up to 20 times lower with the talazoparib treatment when compared to olaparib. Not only does this indicate that talazoparib is much more potent than olaparib, but also preferentially impairs cell growth in PTEN mutants. PTEN’s signal transduction prevents the phosphorylation of AKT, which is necessary for cell proliferation. When cells were treated with an AKT inhibitor, MK2206, alone or in combination with talazoparib, pAKT protein levels decreased, but the greatest effect was seen when MK2206 was used in combination with a low dose of talazoparib in the Myc-Cap cell line with wt PTEN. Western blot analysis showed that PTEN was upregulated following talazoparib treatment. These results indicate synergy of talazoparib and MK2206 in reducing the phosphorylation of AKT in a dose-dependent manner. Talazoparib is by far the most potent PARP inhibitor developed to date. With talazoparib potentially acting on prostate cancer with PTEN mutations, talazoparib treatment may expand current PARP inhibitor treatment in advanced prostate cancers and thereby elicit a response in as many as 80% of patients.

The 10 cases consisted of either benign prostate tissues or prostate cancer, positive or negative for ERG rearrangement and/or PTEN deletion. 350 (91%) of the slides were successfully stained for all 4 molecular targets. The expected ERG and PTEN status were detected with high reproducibility.  Conclusions', '  We developed an automated QD based multiplex ISH assay to simultaneously detect ERG rearrangement and PTEN deletion in prostate cancer. The assay is highly sensitive and reproducible. It enables investigation of potential clinical use of ERG and PTEN as predictive or prognostic markers. In addition, the same technology is expected to enable multiplex in situ detection of other molecular biomarkers using standard clinical specimens.']",

Establishing immunocompetent and clinically relevant models that predict treatment response is essential for the development of novel immunotherapies. To gain better insights into the preclinical evaluation of novel immunotherapeutic strategies, we used genetically engineered mouse models of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer. We first analyzed the transcriptome in castration-naïve prostate tumors and the progression to castration-resistant disease. Comparative analyses were performed between age-matched normal prostate and PTEN-/- prostate tumor samples from castration-naïve mice and, at 4 weeks (castration-sensitive) and 10 weeks (castration-resistant) post-surgical castration. Pathway and gene-set enrichment analysis indicated that abnormal tumor immunity was strongly associated with the progression to castration resistance. Chemokine signaling, B cell receptor and T cell receptor signaling pathways were among the top dysregulated pathways, and gene signatures of suppressed tumor immunity were enriched in castration-resistant tumors. Higher expression patterns of the programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) were observed in castration-resistant tumors compared to castration-naïve tumors. We also characterized immune expression profiles in more aggressive tumors from PTEN/P53 double knockout (DKO) mice. PD-L1 was strongly expressed cancer cells, but a higher presence of PD-1+, CD45+ and F4/80+ stromal infiltrating immune cells in was observed in castration-resistant tumors. PD-1/PD-L1 blockade with antibodies against mouse PD-L1 increased CD45+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in an early model of PTEN/P53-deficient castration-resistant prostate cancer. PTEN/P53-DKO mice with advanced castration-naïve prostate cancer tended to experienced longer overall survival after treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade compared to vehicle and isotype controls, median survival 23, 14 and 11 days, respectively, P=0.458. A higher number of CD45+ TILs was observed in tumors of mice receiving the anti-PD-L1 treatment. Interim analysis of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade on a model of advanced PTEN/P53-deficient castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has thus far shown that mice receiving treatment experience significantly longer survival (P=0.017, median survival not yet reached). Our findings show that castration-resistance promotes tumor immune suppression in mouse PTEN-deficient prostate cancer and suggest that this phenomenon can be reversed pharmacologically with anti-PD-L1 blockade. Thus, we provide preclinical evidence for immune checkpoint blockade as a potentially promising prostate cancer therapy.']",

We have used genetically engineered mouse models of prostate cancer to show the treatment efficacy of monotherapy with the AKT inhibitor AZD5363 and the MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY142886). We hypothesized that a rational combinatorial approach utilizing both of these inhibitors would improve treatment efficacy compared to single agent monotherapy. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the treatment effects of AZD5363 and selumetinib in preclinical models of prostate cancer. In vitro experiments were carried out using a panel of human prostate cancer cell lines, and mouse prostate cancer cell lines, derived from PTEN-deficient castration-nave prostate cancer (CNPC) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Treatments with AZD5363 and selumetinib demonstrated a synergistic combination effect in both human and mouse prostate cancer cell lines. We evaluated the antitumor effects in vivo by comparing the effects of AZD5363 and selumetinib alone or in combination in PTEN-deficient mice. Our studies show that combination therapy of AZD5363/selumetinib was well-tolerated by the mice and demonstrated significantly improved inhibition of tumor growth compared to single agent therapy.

The phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) is frequently inactivated in PCa. Approximately 40% of primary and 70% of metastatic PCa's have genomic alterations in the PI3K-signaling, mostly through the loss of PTEN. Majority of metastatic PCa associated with PTEN loss are treated with docetaxel; an FDA approved therapy for recurrent PCa. However, in PTEN null PCa docetaxel treatment enhances senescence and does not significantly impact tumor volume. These findings were further confirmed in PCa patients with decreased levels of PTEN. In order to understand the global impact of docetaxel in PTEN null PCa we performed an unbiased RNA-seq of prostate tissues harvested from docetaxel treated prostate specific PTEN null mice. Data analysis showed strong enrichment of chromatin modifying enzymes reactome, mainly PRC2 as one of the top ranked categories. Among them EZH2, an oncogenic methyltransferase was found to be significantly upregulated. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed statistically significant upregulation of EZH2 in docetaxel treated mice compared to vehicle control. EZH2 upregulation was independent of androgen levels as both androgen dependent and independent cells showed striking upregulation of EZH2 when treated with docetaxel. Next, we confirmed the nature of the upregulated EZH2 (catalytic or non-catalytic) by docetaxel. EZH2 methyltransferase activity assay data showed significant induction of methyltransferase activity by docetaxel in both androgen dependent and independent conditions and in PTEN null mouse tissues. Further, we measured other methyltransferase marks i.e. H3K27me1&2, H3K4me3, H3K9me3 in the presence of docetaxel and found only specific upregulation of H3K27me3, confirming upregulation of only catalytic EZH2 by docetaxel. These data suggested a need for co-targeting EZH2 during docetaxel treatment in PTEN null PCa conditions. In order to provide a proof-of-principle we performed a tumor xenograft study in nude mice implanted with PTEN null PC3 cells. Combination of DZNeP (an EZH2 inhibitor) and docetaxel significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to each agent alone. Results obtained from the xenograft studies prompted us to perform a preclinical study in prostate specific PTEN null mice. Data obtained from this study clearly showed a significant reduction in number of high grade lesions in PTEN null tumors in combination group when compared to either docetaxel or DZNeP treated mice. We also observed clearance of senescent cells and accumulation of CD8+ T cells and classical dendritic (CD8+ Clec9a+ positive) cells. Our data suggests the necessity of designing a combination therapy of targeting EZH2 during docetaxel treatment specifically, which will likely increase the efficacy of docetaxel in PTEN null PCa.\"]",

Alternative splicing occurs as a common natural phenomenon and promotes diversity, however, cancer-related alternative splicing events have been shown to contribute to disease progression and promote therapeutic escape. In prostate cancer, key genes required for normal biological function are frequently alternatively spliced resulting in altered phenotypes. Novel therapeutic strategies targeting the alternative splicing machinery are being developed and tested. Here, characterized the conditional PTEN-deficient mouse model of prostate cancer to determine its relevancy as preclinical tool for the development and efficacy determination of novel therapeutic strategies targeting aberrant alternative splicing. For this, we used the Affymetrix GeneChip mouse transcriptome assay to perform comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of normal prostate tissue and PTEN-deficient castration-nave, castration-sensitive (4 weeks post-castration), and castration-resistant (10 weeks post-castration) prostate cancers. Clustering analysis revealed genes enriched with the functions involved in mRNA splicing and processing in mice with prostate tumors. Moreover, alternative splicing events were more prevalent in castration-sensitive tumors (>2.5-fold) compared to castration-nave and castration resistant tumors. Exon skipping (cassette exon), was the most common splicing event observed in all conditions. Additionally, alternative splicing was observed in several genes frequently associated with human prostate cancer including CD44, AR, p53, Bcl2l1 and Klf6 among others. Collectively, our data shows that alternative mRNA splicing is a frequent event in mouse PTEN-deficient prostate cancer and supports a role for alternative splicing dysregulation and the pathogenesis of the disease.

Protein kinase C epsilon (PKC), a member of the PKC family of phorbol ester/diacylglycerol receptors, has emerged as an oncogenic kinase and shown to be up-regulated in human prostate cancer specimens. We recently demonstrated that PKC is an upstream regulator of NF-B activation in prostate cancer (JBC, 287', '37570-37582, 2012) and that transgenic overexpression of PKC in mice prostate under the control of the probasin promoter (PB-PKC) leads to hyperplasia and PIN lesions but was insufficient to drive neoplastic changes (Cell Cycle, 10', '268-277, 2011). Notably, when we intercrossed PB-PKC mice with mice haploinsufficient for Pten, another common genetic alteration in human prostate cancer, the resulting compound mutant mice (PB-PKC;Pten+/- mice) developed fully invasive adenocarcinoma with elevated NF-B levels. In the present study, we aim to delineate the mechanism underlying the observed cooperativity between PKC overexpression and Pten deficiency and to explore the consequences of this cooperativity on the transcription factor NF-B signaling, a pathway known to be highly dysregulated in prostate tumorigenesis. To this end, we stably overexpressed PKC in mouse prostate epithelial lines that are either heterozygous (P8) or homozygous (CaP8) for Pten deletion. We observed a striking synergism between PKC overexpression and Pten loss in conferring enhanced proliferative, migratory and invasive phenotype. Moreover, LPS or TNF stimulation of these cells led to increased NF-B activation as evident from the elevated IB phosphorylation, NF-B nuclear translocation and transactivation of a NF-B luciferase reporter. These effects were much more pronounced in CaP8 cells. Of note, PKC overexpression and Pten loss also cooperates to augment levels of the NF-B regulated gene, COX-2. Stable overexpression of PKC and Pten depletion in normal immortalized RWPE1 cells also resulted in significant enhancements in TNF-induced NF-B activation and COX-2 induction. Furthermore, NF-B inhibition by parthenolide significantly retarded the growth of CaP8-PKC tumors in athymic nude mice. Overall, our results identify NF-B as a mediator of PKC oncogenesis in prostate cancer, particularly in the context of Pten loss.']",

Herein, we investigated whether δ-T is able to inhibit the development of prostate adenocarcinoma in prostate-specific Pten-/- (Ptenp-/-) mice, in which the activation of AKT resulted from loss of Pten is the driver. By feeding Ptenp-/- mice with the AIN93M or 0.2% δ-T supplemented diet starting at the age of 6 or 12 weeks, we found that, at the age of 40 weeks, δ-T treatment reduced the number of invasive prostate adenocarcinoma by 53.3% (p<0.005) and 42.7% (p<0.001), respectively. By immunohistochemical analysis, the activation of AKT via phosphorylation of AKT(T308) was found reduced in the prostate of the mice on δ-T diet. Consistently, proliferation was reduced and apoptosis was increased in prostate of the mice on δ-T diet. We also determined oxidative stress by immunohistochemical staining of 8-OH-dG and nitro-tyrosine, and found that these markers were not altered during prostate tumorigenesis, nor they were affected by δ-T. A 0.2% α-tocopherol diet was also used to feed Ptenp-/- mice, but did not inhibit the development of prostate adenocarcinoma, consistent with previous data demonstrating that α-tocopherol did not inhibit the activation of AKT.

Inactivation of P53 is a characteristic that is frequent in advanced prostate cancer. To address this issue, we generated series of double K/O mice based on either P53 loss or gain of function in combination with PTEN inactivation. Conditional inactivation of both PTEN and P53 results in the development of aggressive tumors compared to PTEN K/O mice. Homozygous PTEN/P53-mutants mice grow prostate tumors at a faster rate and experience dramatically reduced survival. Homozygous double K/O mice also developed a higher frequency and number of metastases. Furthermore, haploinsufficient P53 gain of function mutations contributed to an invasive cancer phenotype compared to P53 loss of function haploinsufficient tumors. In conclusion, our analyses demonstrate that synchronous inactivation of PTEN and P53 promotes an aggressive prostate cancer and provides rationale that supports that use of such models is better suited for studies requiring long-term survival and end-stage cancer characterization.']",

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in males after lung cancer in the USA. Under normal conditions, the essential role of androgen through the androgen receptor (AR) is to support prostate epithelial cell growth, functional differentiation and survival. However, the androgen and AR-mediated signaling pathways can also promote genesis, progression and metastasis of prostate cancer. Thus, androgen deprivation or abrogation of the AR signaling remains the first-line treatment for human advanced prostate cancer. Unfortunately, these prostate cancers develop resistance to these therapies and progress to androgen-independent or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with an average latency period of 18 months. Docetaxel chemotherapy and newly developed androgen synthesis blocker or AR signaling inhibitors have been demonstrated to be efficacious against CRPC. However, the median increase in survival was only four to five months. Thus, identification of molecular targets contributing to the initiation and progression of CRPC is a critical step to develop effective mechanism-based prostate cancer therapies. Recent studies provided compelling genetic evidence that Pten deletion, the most frequent genetic alterations identified in 70% of human advanced prostate cancers, promotes PCa progression to CRPC in preclinical mouse models. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying Pten deletion-driven CRPC, we established an AR-positive prostate cancer cell line derived from an aggressive prostate tumor developed in a genetic mouse model carrying deletion of Pten only in prostate epithelium. Our initial characterization studies show that these cancer cells proliferated and grew well in an anchorage-independent growth assay either in the absence of androgen or genetic depletion of AR in vitro. In support of this notion, we found that these cancer cells formed tumors in female NOD/SCID IL2RG null mice. Interestingly, the tumors grow faster and larger in female NOD/SCID IL2RG null mice than in their male counterparts. These observations promoted us to further examine the role of estrogen in the development of CRPC. Genetic and pharmacologic studies suggested that estrogen, through its receptor alpha (ER)-FOXA1-mediated signaling pathway, increased cancer cell proliferation in vitro and promoted prostate tumor development in xenografts in female SCID mice. Furthermore, we found that these cancer cells display features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as characterized by the loss of E-cadherin and CK8 coupled with an increase in N-cadherin, vimentin, and twist expression. Collectively, our data suggest that (ER)-FOXA1-mediated signaling pathway and EMT play an important role in Pten deficiency-driven CRPC. Thus, targeting these signaling pathways might be a novel approach to complement current therapies of CRPC.Citation Format', ' Fengxia Wu, Lei Wang, Hua Xiong, Li-Ju Chang, Tao Lin, Junxuan Lu, Yibin Deng.

Therefore, we utilized this clinically relevant PTEN-mutant mouse model to evaluate the chemopreventive potential of BRBs against prostate cancer.Genotyped 5-week-old male PTEN-mutant mice, randomly assigned to control and treatment groups (n = 12 mice/group), were fed AIN-93G diet (control) or AIN-93G diet supplemented with BRBs (5 or 10%) for 23 weeks. Age-matched non-transgenic mice (wild-type) served as experimental controls (n = 6). Animal weight and food consumption were measured during the treatment period, and the mice were euthanized at 28 weeks of age. Prostate tissues were harvested, weighed and fixed in 10% formalin for histopathological analysis. Histological, cell proliferation (Ki-67 staining) and apoptosis (TUNEL) analyses were performed to determine the chemopreventive potential of BRBs.PTEN-mutant mice fed control or BRB (5 or 10%) diets had steady body weight gain, 16 to 18 g during the 23-week treatment. BRB diets were well tolerated as none of the animals fed BRBs exhibited any observable toxicity.

Furthermore, mice fed both 5 and 10% BRBs contained more normal appearing prostates (free from PIN lesions and adenocarcinomas), when compared to control mice (54 and 33% compared to 3%, respectively).

Although aberrant ATF3 expression was often found in human cancers, the role of ATF3 in tumorigenesis is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that ATF3 suppresses the development of prostate cancer induced by knockout of the tumor suppressor Pten in mouse prostates. Whereas oncogenic stress caused by Pten loss induced ATF3 expression in prostate epithelium, we found that ATF3 deficiency increased cell proliferation but inhibited apoptosis, leading to early onset of mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and the progression of prostate lesions to invasive adenocarcinoma. Importantly, loss of ATF3 appeared to promote activation of the oncogenic AKT signaling evidenced by high levels of phosphorylated AKT and S6 proteins in ATF3-null prostate lesions. In line with these in vivo results, knockdown of ATF3 expression in human prostate cancer cells by sgRNA-mediated targeting activated AKT, elevated NF-KB nuclear translocation and increased expression of a broad of matrix metalloproteinase such as MMP-9, MMP-10. By zymography and q-PCR assays, we found that MMP-9 expression increased in ATF3-knockdown DU145 and PC3 cells. Also from luciferase reporter result, we further confirmed that loss of ATF3 could elevate MMP-9 expression via activating NF-KB. And in vivo immunochemistry results also show increased MMP9 expression and discontinuous a-SMA staining along prostate glands. These results were well anticipated that ATF3 deficiency leads to activated AKT signaling, which further activates IKK-A to increase nuclear translocation of NF-KB, which in turn binds to the MMP-9 promoter and induces MMP-9 expression in ATF3-downregulated prostate cancer cells, then promotes invasion in Pten-lost mouse prostates. Our results thus link ATF3 to the AKT signaling, and provide the first genetic evidence supporting that ATF3 is a tumor suppressor for a subset of prostate cancers harboring dysfunctional Pten.']",

It can also promote survival by modulating tumor cell proliferation, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and immune response. However, recent preclinical data suggests that STAT3 may also act as a tumor suppressor in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of AZD1480, a potent JAK1/2 inhibitor, in genetically engineered mouse models of prostate cancer driven by the loss of PTEN and PTEN/P53.

Slides stained with CymogenDx's PTEN del-TECT FOUR COLOR probe, developed for reliably detecting PTEN deletion, are scanned using 3DHISTECH's Panoramic 250 FLASH II digital slide scanner and the resulting whole slides are subsequently analyzed using 3DHISTECH's FISHQuant software. The ability to capture fluorescent signals from 9 independent channels and up to 29 different Z layers with perfect co-localization enables the creation of multiple labelled fluorescent slides. 3DHISTECH's Extended Focus feature creates a single in-focus image where all the in-focus parts of each captured layer is merged into one composite image. This enables the use of automated algorithms to evaluate different FISH probes in tissue and cytology whole slide samples. The FISHQuant software segments nuclei and spots automatically and scores the resulting data. For PTEN deletion, it measures the deletion clusters for the 3 colors involved. It also uses the control to check for numerical deviation of the 10th chromosome's signals. These two measurements are run automatically and displayed on a two-dimensional HistoPlot. This proof of concept study, using prostate core needle biopsies, demonstrates that the PTEN deletion FISH signals captured on a digital slide and overlaid in bright field and fluorescence modes can be subsequently analyzed using automated algorithms. The ability to identify tumor heterogeneity in a prostate core biopsy (and other sample preps) thus becomes possible. Extended focus and the patent pending PTEN del-TECT FOUR COLOR probe limits truncations artifact and makes a huge difference as sections get thinner due to other tests needing to be performed.

We have demonstrated in a murine model for prostate cancer that complete inactivation of the tumor suppressor Pten elicits a senescence response, which significantly opposes tumorigenesis (Chen ZB, Nature 2005). Here we characterize Pten loss induced cellular senescence (PICS) as a novel type of senescence. Additionally, we show that compounds which target PTEN and MDM-2 can be used alone or in combination to potentiate the senescence pathway in tumors of genetically engineered mouse (GEM) and human xenografts models. Methods', ' Cell growth inhibition, western blot analysis and senescence assay (SA) were performed on LnCAP, MDA-PCa2b and PC3 cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemestry analysis and SA were performed in murine tumors. Cells were incubated with the PTEN inhibitor VO-OHpic (V) and the MDM-2 inhibitor, Nutlin-3 (N) at doses including the IC50 for each drug and cell type. In vivo evaluation of V and N were done both in Pten null prostate conditional mice (Ptenpc-/-) and human xenograft models. Results', ' PICS, represents a distinct type of senescence response that can be targeted for cancer therapy. PICS occurs at early time points after Pten inactivation and in the absence of cellular proliferation and DNA damage. Importantly, we have identified and developed for cancer therapy a novel PTEN inhibitor. Pharmacological inhibition of PTEN drives senescence in vitro and inhibits tumourigenesis in vivo in a human xenograft model. We also find that PICS is associated with enhanced mTOR-dependent p53 translation. In agreement with these mechanistic findings, N dramatically potentiate senescence and strongly inhibits tumorigenesis in Ptenpc-/- mice. Combination of V and N acts synergistically in inducing senescence in vitro and reducing cell growth. Conclusions', ' Taken together, our data identify a type of cellular senescence that can be triggered in non-proliferating cells in the absence of DNA damage . On the basis of this concept, we define a molecular framework for \"pro-senescence\" therapy against cancer.']",

Treating CRPC with second generation androgen -ablation based therapies like enzalutamide and abiraterone exhibit only a short window of therapeutic benefit resulting in chemoresistance. Hence, there is an immediate need for identification of novel targets to eradicate CRPC effectively. We and others have reported targeting AKT activation could efficiently suppress the growth of CRPC cells; in fact a number of clinical trials have shown some promise that AKT could be an attractive target for CRPC. In fact, clinical studies from our lab have suggested that AKT activation predominantly occurs in Gleason stage specific manner suggesting identification of novel drugs to inhibit AKT activation is imperative. Our earlier finding suggests that Withaferin-A (WA), an herbal molecule effectively inhibits the growth of CRPC cells by downregulating AKT activation and its downstream pro-survival events. Present study investigated whether oral administration of WA may inhibit tumor development in Pten conditional knockout mice [(Pten-loxp/loxp', 'PB-Cre4+) (Pten-KO)] which will be a unique and appropriate preclinical model to study the AKT driven prostate tumor. Oral administration of WA for 45 weeks effectively prevented the tumor growth without any significant signs of toxicity to organs in Pten-KO mice. Vehicle and WA (5mg/kg body weight) were orally given up to 45 weeks. Gross pathological studies suggested a significant inhibition of growth and micro metastasis in WA-treated mice as compared to the vehicle treated mice. On microscopic examination of the prostatic tissue, we found that the WA-treated tumors showed more necrosis than the control group and some of the tumors were more differentiated than the controls in the same group. All the organs were completely submitted for histological evaluation. None of the WA-treated mice organs showed any metastatic lesion on the other hand, we found discrete metastasis to lungs in the control tumors. Our ongoing immunohistochemistry analysis may corroborate our in vitro findings that down regulation of AKT and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers such as -catenin, snail, and vimentin in WA treated tumors as compared to the control mice. Overall, these results provide important scientific evidence in support of AKT signaling as a target to inhibit CRPC as well as metastatic CRPC.']",

Due to the very long latency of lesion progression, chemoprevention of prostate adenocarcinogenesis is recognized as a plausible and essential approach to win the war against PCa. Whereas the results from recent clinical trials (SWOG 9917 and SELECT) did not support the protective function for seleno-methionine (SeMet) supplement in healthy men with or without high grade PIN, we and others have shown that supra-nutritional supplement of methylseleninic acid (MSeA), which differs, both chemically and metabolically, from SeMet, suppressed tumor growth in human prostate cancer xenografts, and in the transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. However, the former models did not mimic primary prevention, and the TRAMP mice vastly differ from the etiology and adenocarcinogenesis nature of the human prostate cancers. Therefore, a mouse model that closely recapitulates the clinic pathological features of human prostate cancer will be essential and necessary to predict the preventive efficacy and mechanisms of MSeA in men. As the loss of tumor suppressor gene Pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) plays a causal role in human prostate cancers, the prostate epithelial-specific Pten-knockout mouse is such a preclinical model of choice. Here we utilized Probasin-Cre (Pb-Cre) transgenic mice expressing Cre to delete Pten in prostate epithelium to investigate whether administration of MSeA inhibited prostate tumorigenesis. We treated Pten-knockout and age-matched wild type male mice from 8 weeks of age with water or MSeA at a dose of 3 mg/kg body weight five times a week (Monday through Friday) for 27 weeks and sacrificed them for analyses. Our results show that MSeA significantly suppressed prostate tumorigenesis as evidenced by (1) suppression of tumor progression to high grade PIN or/and adenocarcinoma; (2) a 50% reduction in prostate tumor weight (P<0.01); (3) a significant reduction in cellular proliferation determined by ki67 immunostaining (P<0.01); and (4) attenuation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Mechanistically, we found that MSeA induced a super-activation of p53, p21 and cellular senescence. Because intact p53 signaling is preserved in most early prostate lesions, our findings provide compelling rationale to consider MSeA as a bioactive dietary supplement to activate p53-p21 mediated senescence as a barrier to prevent PIN from progressing to advanced prostate cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer (PCa) is a heterogeneous disease and the development of a molecular classification is critical to distinguish lethal from indolent tumors and reduce overtreatment. Genomic alterations of the PTEN and ETS genes (e.g., ERG) are among the most common in PCa and there is a huge interest in exploiting these alterations for risk assessment. We have found that PTEN loss is associated with PCa death most strongly in patients whose tumors do not carry an ERG rearrangement, contradicting findings from mouse models.Despite technological advances have enabled extraordinary insight into PCa molecular alterations, our understanding of the interaction between PTEN and ETS genes during PCa progression remains very limited. Hence, we have analyzed a large collection of multi-omics datasets to characterize the molecular underpinnings of PTEN loss in the context of ETS-negative versus ETS-positive tumors and further investigate their role in driving PCa prognosis.First we have developed a classification approach for PCa stratification based on dichotomized gene expression of PTEN and ETS family members. We have then validated this approach using TCGA DNA copy number variation and rearrangement status information. Our results confirmed that transcriptome analysis can be used for detecting PTEN and ETS alterations, and that in the absence of ERG rearrangements, tumors with PTEN loss frequently overexpress alternative ETS genes.Next, we examined whether somatic mutation profiles might differ by PTEN/ETS status, providing an potential explanation for the lethal behavior of ERG-negative/PTEN-negative tumors. As expected SPOP mutation was found to be mutually exclusive with ERG expression, but it did not vary significantly by PTEN status. Most interestingly, TP53 mutation - the most frequently altered gene in lethal metastatic PCa - was significantly enriched among PTEN-negative tumors irrespective to ERG- status. Collectively these findings suggest that known prognosis-driving somatic mutations do not explain the aggressive behavior of ERG-negative/PTEN-negative tumors.Finally, we analyzed differential gene expression associated with PTEN loss in the presence or absence of ERG gene expression and identified the associated biological processes and signaling pathways. This analysis failed to confirm the correlation between ERG/ETV1 expression and higher androgen signaling output previously reported in murine models. Furthermore, our findings revealed that MYC targets and the genes involved in cell cycle progression are the most up-regulated by PTEN loss in ETS-negative tumors, while genes involved in cell differentiation, response to DNA damage, and TNF signaling are the most induced by PTEN loss in ERG-positive tumors.Overall, our analysis clarified some important aspects of the role of PTEN/ETS network in PCa progression, suggesting a number of promising targets for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.']",

In this study, we examined the antitumor effects of dutasteride in vivo using a preclinical model of prostate cancer that is based on the PSA-Cre mediated inactivation of PTEN.

Treatment with dutasteride had a minimal effect on tumor cell proliferation; however, it significantly increased the apoptotic rate in tumors. Interestingly, treatment with dutasteride resulted in increased activation of PI3K/mTOR signaling and a reduction of STAT3 pathway activation. Moreover, increased activation of MAPK, which occurs after treatment with mTOR inhibitors, was effectively reduced with the co-administration of dutasteride.

We have shown in human tumor xenografts that the combination of IGF-IR inhibition with the human mab IMC-A12 in combination with androgen deprivation (ADT) was more efficacious than ADT alone. In a subsequent neoadjuvant study with IMC-A12, responses were at least as efficacious in hi-grade disease (Gleason 7 (4+3), 8, and 9) when compared to ADT alone. In order to determine predictors of response to IMC-A12 plus ADT (surgical castration) in human prostate cancer, we examined the response of 21 human prostate cancer xenografts (LuCaP series) grown in SCID mice for responses to castration, IMC-A12 40mg/kg ip 3x a week for four weeks, or castration followed by four weeks of IMC-A12. At the end of the IMC-A12 treatment animals were followed until tumor recurrence. When all animals were completed tumor growth was analyzed. The main differences in growth rates, as expected based on previous studies, occurred in mice receiving IMC-A12 plus castration compared to castration alone. Responses were segregated into three groups', ' Major Response - slope of tumor growth was negative in the IMC-A12 + Castration group compared to castration alone; Moderate Response - slope of combined treatment is flat and castration alone is positive; No-response - no differences in slope between castration and castration plus IMC-A12. We then examined the association of response to IMC-A12 to potential effectors of IGF-IR expression and signaling in the prostate including AR and AR splice variants and PTEN status. Tumor transcript profiles were generated on all xenografts prior to treatment and gene sets predictive of response determined. None of the PTEN null tumors showed a strong response to IMC-A12 and all PTEN null tumors expressed the AR-splice variant ARv567es. Of the 3 xenografts with one copy of PTEN, non- or partial responders either expressed no AR (neuroendocrine tumor) or expressed ARv567es. Of xenografts with 2 or more copies of PTEN, non- or moderate responders expressed AR-variants. Finally, transcript profiles provided a gene signature that was highly predictive of response to IMC-A12. These data indicate that PTEN insufficiency or the presence of an AR-splice variant that cannot increase IGF-IR via non-genomic activity are associated with resistance to IMC-A12. Further, a gene signature has been developed from the 21 xenografts that is predictive of response to IMC-A12 and castration.']",

Recently mTOR was shown to control de novo pyrimidine synthesis via S6K which directly phosphorylates Ser1859 on CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamoylase, dihydroorotase), the enzyme that catalyzes the first three steps of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. We assessed the CAD expression and phosprylation at Ser1859 in different in-vitro and in-vivo models of PCa and also tested the potential efficacy of fisetin, an agent which we previously established as a dual PI3K/AKT and mTOR inhibitor. We observed upregulation of CAD both at transcriptional and translational levels in PCa cell lines when compared with the non-tumorigenic prostate cells. However, a highly significant upregulation of CAD phosphorylation at Ser1859 was evident in PTEN deficient cells when compared with wild type PTEN cells. To confirm, we assessed the CAD phosphorylation at Ser1859 in PTEN knockout mice samples and observed significant increase in the CAD phosphorylation at Ser1859 but not in total CAD levels, suggesting high demands of de novo pyrimidine synthesis in PTEN deficient tumors. In another model of spontaneous PCa (TRAMP) an inverse association between CAD phosphorylation at Ser1859 and PTEN was observed. Based on the facts that PTEN deficient cells have high mTOR activity that is prerequisite for CAD phosphorylation we tested the efficacy of fisetin to inhibit CAD phosphorylation at Ser1859 in different PCa models. Fisetin significantly suppressed the CAD phosphorylation in tumorigenic PCa cells in-vitro. In-vivo efficay of fisetin for inhibition of CAD phosphorylation was also established in the xenograft study. However, decrease in abundance of CAD mRNA and protein in xenograft samples suggested fisetin additionally suppressed other mechanism(s) important for CAD expression. Next we determined the effect of fisetin to inhibit the growth factors (insulin/IGF-1/EGF) stimulated CAD oligomerization in PCa cells important for CAD activity. Fisetin significantly suppressed the growth factors induced CAD oligomerization as observed by electron microscopy and density gradient based western blotting. However, we did not find significant S-phase blockage by fisetin under similar conditions. Based on these data we suggest that PTEN deficient PCa epithelial tumors possess heightened de novo pyrimidine requirements, satisfied by growth factor stimulated and mTOR regulated CAD phosphorylation and oligomerization. Fisetin inhibits both CAD phosphorylation at Ser1859 and oligomerization and thereby limits pyrimidine sufficiency in PTEN deficient PCa cells. Our results add additional mechanistic insight in the fisetin mediated inhibition of PCa and suggest the use of fisetin in PTEN deficient PCa incidents.']",

Results', ' There was no difference between the weight of genitourinary bloc of RC+ mice and that of RC mice at 4, 6 and 9 weeks. At 12 and 30 weeks, the GUbloc weight of RC+ mice was 14% and 47% heavier than that of RC mice, respectively (P = 0.005, N = 54, and P = 0.004, N = 32, respectively). We found similar prostatic epithelial hyperplasia at 4 weeks and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) at 6 weeks in both RC+ and RC mice, suggesting that IL17RC knockout did not affect PIN formation. At 9 weeks, invasive cancer was formed in 87% of RC+ prostate lobes, but only in 25% of RC prostate lobes (P < 0.001). At 30 weeks, 100% of RC+ prostate lobes formed invasive cancer, whereas only 70% of RC prostate lobes showed invasive cancer (P < 0.005). This suggests that IL17RC knockout decreased progression of PIN to invasive cancer. The RC PINs were surrounded with a thick layer of fibromuscular stroma, whereas the stroma layer was significantly thinner in RC+ prostate glands, suggesting that failure of PIN to invade stroma was a critical deficit in RC mice. We found that MMP7 expression was significantly decreased in RC prostates compared to RC+ prostates, suggesting that lack of MMP7 expression is likely responsible for the observed phenotype. Furthermore, we found that IL17 treatment induced MMP7 mRNA and protein expression in exvivo cultured RC+ prostate tissues but not in RC prostate tissues, suggesting that MMP7 is a downstream target gene of IL17 signaling.

Since PTEN is yet to be effectively targeted with drugs, its downstream target Akt may provide more viable therapeutic strategies. The essential role of Akt in PTEN-null tumor initiation has been demonstrated in a number of studies. However, the role of Akt in the maintenance of established PTEN-deficient tumors is not known. Moreover, whether PTEN-null tumors depend on a specific Akt isoform for survival signaling remains elusive.In this study, we have developed a tet-on inducible system for expressing Akt1/2/3 shRNAs to determine the role of Akt isoforms in PTEN-deficient cancer progression. Three-dimensional (3D) matrigel cultures are employed to better recapitulate tumors growing in vivo. Administration of doxycycline (dox) in Akt1 or Akt2 shRNA PTEN-null prostate tumor cells at the start of culture resulted in the inhibition of spheroid formation, suggesting an important role of both Akt1 and Akt2 in the initial growth of spheroids. Conversely, when spheroids were allowed to form for 7 days, followed by dox for further 10 days, no difference was observed between Akt1-depleted and control spheroids. In contrast, silencing of Akt2 resulted in complete disintegration of spheroids. Confocal microscopy studies show a significant induction of active caspase-3 and fragmented nuclei in Akt2-silenced cells. Moreover, whereas Akt1 is uniformly expressed, Akt2 is localized in the cytoplasm and/or on the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the differences of effect of Akt isoforms on cell survival in conventional 2D culture are considerably more modest. The exclusive requirement of Akt2 for survival is also observed in other PTEN-deficient solid tumors, including breast cancer and glioblastoma. Importantly, shRNA silencing of Akt2 but not Akt1 promotes regression of prostate cancer xenografts. Mechanistically, we show that Akt2 silencing up-regulates p21 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and downregulates the insulin-like growth factor receptor-1. We also show that p21 is an effector of Akt2 in mediating prostate tumor cell survival.These results indicate that Akt2, but not Akt1, plays a critical role in PTEN-deficient tumor maintenance, and provide a rationale for developing therapeutics targeting Akt2. Current efforts are aimed at identifying novel Akt isoform-specific substrates that contribute to cancer progression using a genome-wide proteomic screen.

Chemopreventive and anticancer effects of Res may be exerted in part by modulating various components of the epigenetic machinery. We recently demonstrated that Res represses nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) co-repressor complex by inhibiting metastasis associated protein 1/ histone deacetylase 1 (MTA1/HDAC1) subunit, which plays an essential role in governing deacetylation of histone and non-histone proteins. Since Res-induced upregulation of tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is concomitant with MTA1-downregulation, we hypothesized that in the absence of Res MTA1 works in cooperation with PI3K/Akt survival pathways. We further hypothesized that Res-induced restoration of PTEN expression and function may occur by dual mechanism through MTA1/HDAC inhibition and regulation of miRNA network. Our data indicate that shRNA-mediated MTA1 knockdown in Du145 cells (wt PTEN) enhances acetylation of PTEN, and that HDAC inhibitor trichostatin (TSA) further potentiates PTEN acetylation. We also showed that Res treatment simultaneously decreases MTA1 and pAkt levels in LNCaP cells, the effect which is enhanced in combination with PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and BEZ235. To further understand Res-induced MTA1-mediated epigenetic alterations, we analyzed MTA1-associated and Res-induced microRNA (miRNA, miR) changes in LNCaP cells expressing and silenced for MTA1 (shMTA1). Interestingly, Res downregulated miRs (oncomiRs) included members of miR17-92 cluster (miRs-17, 20a, 20b) and miRs 106a and 106b which target PTEN. These findings were further confirmed by real time PCR analysis which showed that Res specifically down-regulated these miRNAs in PCa cells (LNCaP and Du145) but not in normal prostate cell line RWPE-1.

        "Background":"['One of the common contributors to the pre-disposition of most human cancers is inappropriate activation of AKT due to loss of its negative regulator PTEN. Activated AKT regulates changes in metabolic processes such as acetyl-CoA production that impacts chromatin. AKT phosphorylates a wide variety of histone modulating enzymes including acetyltransferases and methyltransferases resulting in their hyperactivation or inhibition. Therefore, understanding the impact of AKT inhibition on global histone modification would be ideal to identify novel histone modifiers regulated by AKT. We performed unbiased and comprehensive profiling of histone modifications in prostate specific PTEN knockout mice treated with an AKT inhibitor (Perifosine, 10mg/kg body weight daily for 4 weeks) and observed that AKT inhibition significantly induces di and tri methylation of H3K4, concomitant with reduction acetylation of H3K9. Changes in other histone modifications such as H3K36 and H3K79 methylation and acetylation were not observed. Mechanistically, we observed that AKT inihibiton reduces the expression of H3K4 methylation related histone demethylases KDM5 family, especially KDM5B expression at transcriptional level. Similar observations were noted at translational level also. To further understand the transcriptional regulation of KDM5B by AKT we focused on miR-137 and miR-138 as these have been shown to transcriptionally regulate H3K4 demethylases. We observed that AKT activation negatively regulated miR-137 but not miR-138 levels, which further transcriptionally represses KDM5B expression. Overexpression of miR-137 significantly reduced KDM5B and increased H3K4 di and tri methylation levels but failed to change AKT phosphorylation. Genetic knockdown of AKT or inhibition of AKT phosphorylation increased miR137 and reduced both KDM5B levels. Overall, we observed that AKT transcriptionally regulates KDM5B mainly via repression of miR137. Our data identify a mechanism by which PI3K/AKT signaling modulates the prostate cancer epigenome through regulating H3K4 methylation and KDM5B expression. Additional studies that assess the impact of AKT inhibiton on genome occupancy of H3K4 methylation will help in the identification of targets and devise novel strategies to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of PI3K/AKT inhibitors that are currently in clinical development.']",

PTEN loss of function results in activation of Akt and downstream signaling pathways, and has been associated with numerous cancers, most commonly endometrial cancer, glioblastoma, melanoma and prostate cancer. PTEN loss can be a result of multiple different aberrations which include mutations in the coding region leading to frame-shift or stop codons, genomic deletions as well as promoter methylation leading to loss of PTEN protein. Determination of PTEN status, both at the DNA and protein levels, may be important for clinical decision-making because loss of PTEN is associated with resistance to various targeted therapies, while inactivating mutations may confer sensitivity to therapeutics targeting PI3K pathway members. We have developed Sanger sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) assays to assess PTEN mutation status in a set of FFPE patient specimens.Methods', ' Our Sanger sequencing assay for PTEN was developed to detect known hotspot mutations in exons 5-8, which occur in the majority of PTEN mutations reported in the COSMIC database.

All assays were validated using a combination of plasmids, cell lines and FFPE tissues for specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility and concordance.Results', ' 22 patient FFPE tissue specimens from a variety of tumor types including colon, lung, pancreas, uterus and prostate were evaluated for PTEN mutation and expression status by both Sanger sequencing and IHC methods. Sequencing results were', ' 9 wild-type, 12 heterozygous mutant, and 1 hemizygous mutant. 7 of the 9 specimens reported as wild-type by sequencing exhibited normal protein expression levels by IHC, while 2 were PTEN negative by IHC, suggesting that mechanisms other than mutations in exons 5-8 contributed to the loss of expression of PTEN protein. These 2 specimens were further analyzed by CISH to determine copy number. Of the 13 specimens reported as mutant by sequencing, IHC protein expression results indicated that 6 were PTEN positive and 7 were PTEN negative, underscoring the observation that exon 5-8 mutation status alone is not sufficient to predict PTEN expression levels. Data on CISH analysis of the specimen that was hemizygous mutant by sequencing will be reported to confirm the copy loss.Conclusion', ' The data suggest that additional mutations outside the exon 5-8 region as well as promoter methylation may result in loss of PTEN protein, and that accurate clinical assessment of PTEN mutation and protein expression status in FFPE tissues requires complimentary methods including Sanger sequencing, IHC and CISH methodologies.']",

Recent pharmacologic and genetic studies have identified the  isoform of PI3K to be required for growth of PTEN-deficient tumors in vivo and highly potent compounds are currently being explored in the clinic. These clinical candidates, however, are either limited by poor bioavailability or moderate selectivity against the delta isoform, thus warranting more selective compounds with better exposure. We have undertaken a comprehensive knowledge-based discovery of selective inhibitors of PI3K with admissible pharmacokinetic and drug like properties. We have successfully identified a chemical series with potency ranging as low as 2.5 nM for PI3K with >100 - fold selectivity for PI3K. The  and  isoform selectivity was around 1000 and 500 fold respectively. Compounds did not decrease insulin sensitivity and T cell proliferation thus mitigating the PI3K and PI3K mediated side effects of nonselective inhibitors. In vitro biochemical potency translated into cell survival assay and pAKT target engagement in recombinant and wild type mammalian cell lines. In vivo tumor regression was observed in xenograft models of prostate cancer. The series did not show any observable hERG or CYP liabilities.

The reactive stromal microenvironment of PCa facilitates tumor growth through cytokine and chemokine-mediated cell signaling. STAT1, a transcription factor, induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and modulates immune and inflammatory response through IFN-/ cytokine activation. IFN-/ may be secreted in response to PI3K/AKT activation, since this pathway is associated with JAK/STAT signaling. In addition, the PI3K/AKT pathway can become activated when the PTEN prognostic biomarker is deleted in PCa. The rationale for this project is that the immediate stromal microenvironment of PCa may become pro-tumorigenic as a result of induction of inflammatory cytokines caused by PTEN deletions and activation of PI3K/AKT. We performed FISH analysis of the PTEN gene on 172 cores on a PCa tissue microarray (TMA) derived from 43 patients with intermediate risk disease. Analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear STAT1 in both the tumor and stromal compartments was performed on each TMA core using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine whether the tumor PTEN deletion status was associated with STAT1 expression. In each core, tumor and stromal cell histologies were evaluated independently to estimate the percentage area that was stained positive by IHC. The staining was graded as percentage of positive cells with 0 (negative), 1 (less than 10%), 2 (11% to 50%), and 3 (more than 51%).

Using a bacterial artificial chromosome-based transgenic approach, we generated mice in which Hoxb13 regulatory elements drive expression of human MYC (Hoxb13MYC+) or Cre recombinase (Hoxb13Cre+). Hoxb13Cre+ mice were bred to mice carrying floxed Pten (Ptenfl) alleles to generate focal loss of Pten in the prostate epithelium. We then generated mice carrying both the Hoxb13MYC+ and Hoxb13Cre+ transgenes that also harbored two Ptenfl alleles. Phenotypic analyses of Hoxb13MYC+|Hoxb13Cre+| Ptenfl/fl males revealed pervasive low-grade mouse-PIN (mPIN) in all prostate lobes emerging at two weeks of age that became pervasive that progressed to high-grade mPINby four weeks. The lesions bore hallmarks of human PIN including increased nuclear and nucleolar size and dispersed chromatin. Immunostaining revealed MYC and androgen receptor expression and focal Pten loss within the epithelial compartment. mPIN incidence high-gradewas higher in ventral and anterior lobes. By twelve weeks, lesions progressed to cribriform mPIN/intraductal carcinoma was widespread and scattered intraductal carcinoma lesions were observed. At sixteen weeks, in all animals, large frank invasive adenocarcinoma lesions involving multiple prostate lobes were was present as well as, and histological analyses confirmed the presence of invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.

Copy number analyses using array-based comparative genomic hybridization revealed clonal gene gains and losses in primary prostate cancers and matched metastatic lesions, indicative of genomic instability. The incidence of aggressive cancer and the reproducible chronology of events will enable this model to serve as a robust platform to test strategies to interfere with disease initiation and progression.

Treatment strategies using CQ and its derivative alone or in combination with other anticancer drugs are being considered for clinical applications.

In this study, we investigated the safety and efficacy of long-term CQ therapy in a PTEN-deficient model of prostate cancer. Twenty-eight-week-old tumor-bearing PTEN conditional knockout mice (PSA-CRE+/PTENf/f) were treated with CQ in the drinking water.

At the completion of the study, mice receiving CQ averaged 27.3 grams of bodyweight compared to 33.8 grams in the control group (P<0.001). However, chronic treatment with CQ for 32 weeks inhibited tumor burden by 18.4% (P = 0.0118).

The antitumor effects of AZD5363, a pan AKT inhibitor, and AZD1208, a highly potent Pim kinase inhibitor, were investigated as monotherapy or in combination on mice harboring castration-naïve prostate tumors and mice that developed castration-resistant disease. Mice were randomized treated for four weeks. Safety and tolerability was assessed by bodyweight changes. Antitumor activity was determined by differences in tumor burden, proliferation and apoptosis and histology. Molecular activity was assessed by examining the phosphorylation of common substrates by western blot analysis. Treatments were well-tolerated and no significant differences in bodyweight changes were observed. In castration-naïve prostate tumors, treatments with AZD5363, AZD1208 and AZD5363/AZD1208 resulted in 11.9%, 13.5% and 36.9% reductions of tumor burden compared to vehicle treated controls, respectively, P<0.001. The treatment combination of AZD5363/AZD1208 demonstrated significant antitumor activity compared to monotherapy, P<0.001. In the castration-resistant tumors, treatments with AZD5363, AZD1208 and AZD5363/AZD1208 resulted in 21%, 9.5% and 27% reductions of tumor burden compared to vehicle treated controls, respectively, P<0.004. Although the differences in in tumor burden were not statistically between monotherapy and combination therapy, a notable degree of tumor gland regression was observed in tumors treated with AZD5363/AZD1208. Overall, combination therapy showed a synergistic effect by inhibited or impaired phosphorylation of PRAS40, eIF4B and BAD in both castration-naïve and castration-resistant tumor models. Inhibition of both pathways enhanced the reduction of tumor cell proliferation and increased apoptosis.

Rad51 is an essential protein in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA double strand breaks. Previous studies with non metastatic prostate cancer (mCaP) cells have reported low Rad51 levels in cells with loss of PTEN or under hypoxia, which then led to their sensitivity to PARPi. Given intra tumor hypoxia and loss of PTEN is common in mCaP, we test PAPRi, ABT888 and DNA damaging topoisomerase I inhibitor, CPT11, either alone or in combination in mCaP preclinical models. Methods', '  mCaP cell lines with functional PTEN (DU145) and loss of PTEN (PC3) were grew under normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (0.2% O2). DNA damage, HRR, apoptosis were assessed with comet assay, western blot, immunofluorescence and flowcytometry. The regulation of RAD51 was studied with quantitative RT-PCR and RAD51 promoter reporter assay. PC3 xenograft was used for in vivo study.  Results', '  Despite of its low levels of expression under hypoxia, up regulation of Rad51 was observed soon after treating hypoxic PC3 and Du145 cells with ABT888 or SN38, an active metabolite of CPT11. Such Rad51 up regulation led to less DNA damage and apoptosis under hypoxia compared to normoxia. Inhibiting RAD51 expression with siRNA overcame PC3 and Du145s resistance to SN38. Furthermore, ABT888 enhanced the activities of SN38 as detected by clonogenic assay and flowcytometry under both normoxia and hypoxia. Consistent with the in vitro data, ABT888 by itself had limited anti-tumor activities despite the loss of PTEN in PC3 xenografts. The anti-tumor activity of single agent CPT11 was significantly improved with the ABT888 and CPT11 combination (P<0.008).  Conclusions', '  neither loss of PTEN nor hypoxia sensitized mCaP cells to PARPi or DNA damaging drugs. Such resistance under hypoxia was at least partly due to up regulation of Rad51.

Traditional approaches for the development of novel androgen deprivation therapies have focused on inhibition of AR activity by blocking the production or binding of androgens to the AR. These novel treatment strategies have shown improvements, however, patients still develop castration-resistant disease. Continued AR activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) may be the result of ligand dependent or ligand independent mechanisms. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) have the ability to block specific genes inhibiting the associated proteins thus providing an alternate treatment strategy for CRPC. Here, we investigated the in vivo antitumor effects of a generation 2.5 ASO targeting the mouse AR in a PTEN-deficient mouse model of prostate cancer. Pharmacodynamic analysis demonstrated strong inhibition of target RNA by the AR-ASO in prostate tumor tissues. The AR-ASO also exhibited strong suppression of AR protein levels in prostate tumors as demonstrated by western blot analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed reduced levels of AR expression and transcriptional activity in tumor tissue. Furthermore, AR was also inhibited in normal tissues of the accessory sex glands. The treatment efficacy of the AR-ASO was evaluated in pharmacological intervention trials in mice with castration-nave prostate cancer (CNPC) and CRPC. Treatments effects in CNPC were also compared to androgen deprivation by surgical castration. Compared to saline treated controls, tumor growth was significantly inhibited by the AR-ASO (34%) and was comparable to that of surgical castration (38%). In the CRPC model, significant suppression of tumor growth (10% vs control) was also observed in mice treated with the AR-ASO. Furthermore, strong inhibition of AR expression and activity was observed in AR-ASO-treated mice harboring either CNPC or CRPC, but not in mice treated with surgical castration. Gene expression profiling using the Fluidigm Biomark platform revealed that 40 AR-dependent target genes were significantly altered in CNPC after treatment with the AR-ASO; 34 of these genes were also significantly changed following castration. A decrease of ERK phosphorylation in was observed in AR-ASO-treated mice in both CNPC and CRPC intervention models and was associated with decreased protein levels of AR. These findings demonstrate that treatment with generation 2.5 AR-ASO is effective against preclinical mouse models of prostate cancer and may provide a promising approach to overcoming treatment resistance of CRPC.']",

        "Background":"['Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is one of the most commonly lost tumor suppressors in human cancers. Frequent genetic inactivation of PTEN occurs in glioblastoma, endometrial cancer, and prostate cancer; and reduced expression is found in many other tumor types such as lung and breast cancer. PTEN is mostly found in the cytosol and it transiently associates with the inner surface of the plasma membrane and removes a phosphate group from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and by this, it regulates various cellular functions. However in the nucleus, PTEN mediates phosphatase independent functions and is believed to be important for its tumor suppressive roles. Functional studies further confirm the transcriptional regulatory role of the PTEN; however, the process by which PTEN acts as a potential modulator of chromatin structure and histone modification is unexplored. We observed that the enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase is upregulated in PTEN null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as compared to wild type counterparts, which suggested an inverse relation between EZH2 expression and PTEN expression. We further observed that phospho EZH2 levels (pEZH2ser21) were specifically upregulated in the PTEN null cells and coincided with the high pEZH2', 'EZH2 ratio in these settings, indicating that the majority of the upregulated EZH2 exists in the phosphorylated form. We also found that the pEZH2ser21 is mainly localized in the nucleus and only a small fraction exists in the cytoplasm, suggesting additional roles for pEZH2ser21 after partnering with cytoplasmic proteins. However, the non-phosphorylated form of the EZH2 is totally a nuclear protein under these conditions. Interestingly in PTEN null MEFs, transcriptional repression mark such as H3K27Me3 expression was downregulated with the simultaneous upregulation of H3K4Me3, an active transcription mark. Also, the increased expression of EZH2 primarily linked with the pause of active transcription, was associated with corresponding decrease in the H3K27Me3 repression mark which subsequently influenced the expression of various genes including senescence associated genes such as p21. Since, these aberrant histone methylation marks are hallmarks of various cancer pathologies, targeting EZH2 or its phosphorylation component could be a potential therapeutic strategy in cancers involving loss of PTEN. Taken together, these results demonstrate that in PTEN null processes, the pEZH2ser21 is capable of translocation, altering the histone marks and influencing genes associated with transcriptional repression and senescence. We also suggest that EZH2 could serve as important target for novel chemotherapeutics against cancers that are associated with loss of PTEN.']",

Inactivation of PTEN tumor suppressor function is a common characteristic of human prostate cancer that leads to the upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and has emerged as promising candidate for targeted therapies. mTOR is one of the upstream regulators of autophagy, therefore, inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis putatively stimulates autophagy. However, the role of autophagy in cancer is complex, acting both as a tumor suppressor and promoter, and its role in prostate tumorigenesis remains to be defined. Here we demonstrate that prostate cancer is dependent on autophagy for its growth and progression through the use genetically modified mouse models of prostate cancer.We had previously reported a conditional knockout mouse model in which homozygous deletion of PTEN lead to the stage-specific development of invasive adenocarcinoma. Characterization of tumors from the mice showed that although autophagy was suppressed early in tumor development, tumors eventually restored autophagic function despite increased PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. To determine the effect of defective autophagy on prostate cancer progression, we generated prostate-specific conditional double knockout mice harboring both inactivated PTEN and ATG7, a key regulator for the formation of autophagosomes. Prostate-specific inactivation of ATG7 function alone did not result in changes to the development or function of the prostate gland. Prostate-specific inactivation of both PTEN and ATG7 led to the early development of prostate adenocarcinoma similar to homozygous PTEN-mutant mice. However, prostate tumors failed to progress and showed regression. Our data suggests that impaired autophagy can be induced independent of mTOR and defective autophagy contributes to suppress tumor progression.

Several studies have shown that NF-κB signaling is increased in recurrent prostate cancer and enriched in prostate TICs. We sought to determine the potential of an IKK/NF-κB-driven mechanism for inherent or acquired resistance by IKK-mediated control of a subset of prostate tumor initiating cells. These studies were performed by using established prostate cancer cell lines, murine prostate organoids, and a murine prostate cancer animal model. We have found that inhibition of IKKα and IKKβ, upstream regulators of noncanonical and canonical NF-κB signaling, block self-renewal of several PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we have also found that IKK is important for tumorigenicity and stemness seen in prostate cancer cells as measured by colony formation and extreme limiting dilution assays. Loss of canonical NF-κB (p65/RelA) decreased stemness while loss of noncanonical did not alter tumorsphere formation. Interestingly, Pten-/- tumors with loss of Ikkα or Ikkβ displayed decreased levels of self-renewing cells as measured by CD49fhigh expression, a known prostate basal cell marker. Isolated murine Pten-/- cells were 2x more efficient than Pten-/-Ikkα-/- or Pten-/-Ikkβ-/- cells in forming prostate organoids suggesting that loss of Ikk decreased the number of self-renewing cells needed for formation.

Although inhibition of this enzyme using a pharmacological inhibitor is postulated to enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA-damaging cytotoxic chemotherapy, this has not been profoundly studied in lung cancer. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten) is a tumor-suppressor gene deactivating PI3K downstream of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) signaling. Approximately 2% to 9% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are considered to have PTEN loss, and a recurrent gross-mutation of the PTEN gene is identified in lung cancer with deficient DNA double-strand break repair. We hypothesize that there is a cellular threshold for error-free DNA-repair in lung cancer cells and that the absence of PTEN can sensitize these cells to a concurrent treatment of a DNA-damaging agent (cisplatin) and a PARP inhibitor (olaparib). To investigate the effect of olaparib and cisplatin on PTEN deficient lung tumors, two EGFR mutant (deletion in exon19) NSCLC cell lines, PC-9 (PTEN wild type) and NCI-H1650 (PTEN loss) were used. Two additional cell lines with PTEN loss, prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) and glioblastoma cell line (U-87MG) were also examined. We transfected intact PTEN gene into H1650 cells and knocked down PTEN expression in the PC-9 cells using shRNA. Antiproliferative activity was determined by MTT assay in terms of 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. Olaparib alone was not effective for H1650 cells and other PTEN-deficient cells. IC50 values ranged from 6 to 40 M for olaparib and from 0.2 to 2 M for cisplatin. Combination of cisplatin with olaparib showed a synergistic effect in vitro according to the combination index (CI).

The combination of cisplatin with olaparib was more effective than each agent individually. This effect was not observed in a xenograft model using PTEN transfected H1650 cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that PTEN-deficiency caused a reduction in radiation-induced nuclear RAD51 focus formation and activation of Chk1 S345.

In our previous studies we found that MTA1 expression is significantly increased in prostate-specific Pten-null model, and that potent natural analog of resveratrol, pterostilbene (PTER), exerts its anti-tumorigenic effects by blocking MTA1-associated inactivation (deacetylation) of tumor suppressors.

While an overwhelming increase in ROS trigger cell/tissue damage and death, a slight pro-oxidant state on the other hand serves as a secondary messenger for cell survival and proliferation. Recent evidence also indicates crosstalk between cellular redox status and the PI3K/Akt axis. Consistent with this, in an attempt to understand the survival pathways induced by a slight increase in cellular pro-oxidant status, in particular superoxide anion, we investigated the effect of an altered redox status on the expression of the death inhibitory protein cFLIP. We show that an increase in superoxide resulted in an increase in cFLIP promoter activity as well as protein expression. Interestingly, overexpression of Akt1 or Akt 2 also resulted in cFLIP induction. Of note, the increase in cFLIP promoter activity measured by a luciferase expression system was significantly suppressed when PTEN was restored by over expression. On the other hand, co-expression of Akt1 and Akt2 abrogated PTEN mediated down regulation of cFLIP, further demonstrating the positive regulatory effect of Akt species on cFLIP transcription. More interestingly, the effect of Akt on cFLIP correlated with its ability to increase intracellular superoxide levels (measured by dihydroethidium (DHE) staining as well as Lucigenin-based chemiluminescence), which was in turn blocked upon overexpression of PTEN. Phosphorylation-inefficient mutant AKt construct (dominant negative Akt for S473 and T308 residues) lost 50% of its activity to upregulate cFLIP transcription, indicating that Akt phosphorylation/activation is required for ROS production and cFLIP transcriptional activation. Using functional mutants of PTEN (generously provided by Donald J. Tindall, Mayo Foundation, MN) we further show that the lipid phosphatase function of PTEN is required for its regulation of cFLIP expression. Furthermore, PTEN mediated down regulation of FLIP transcription was rescued by over expression of c-Jun and wild type CREB in a concentration dependent manner, which was corroborated by the observation that pCREB level was lower upon enforced PTEN expression. Finally, to provide a functional relevance of these findings, we demonstrate that PTEN restoration in PTEN-/- LnCaP cells resulted in enhanced sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, which could be rescued by over expression of isoforms of cFLIP, viz., cFLIPs and cFLIPL. Taken together, our preliminary data suggest that loss of PTEN leads to up-regulation of cFLIP transcription via redox dependent mechanisms, thus contributing to survival and chemoresistance in prostate cancer cells.']",

PKC is up-regulated in most epithelial cancers, including prostate cancer. We recently showed that transgenic PKC overexpression in the mouse prostate under the control of probasin (PB) promoter leads to hyperplasia and prostatic intraepithelial neoplastic lesions but is insufficient to drive neoplastic changes. Strikingly, when we intercrossed the prostate-specific PKC transgenic mice with mice haploinsufficient for Pten, a common genetic alteration in human prostate cancer, the resulting compound mutant mice (PB-PKC;Pten+/- mice) developed fully invasive adenocarcinoma (unpublished observation). In the present study, to explore the mechanistic aspects of the observed cooperativity between PKC overexpression and Pten deficiency, we stably overexpressed PKC in mouse prostate epithelial lines that are either heterozygous (P8) or homozygous (CaP8) for Pten deletion. PKC overexpression led to significant enhancement in cell proliferation as well as enhanced the levels of phospho-Akt, phospho-Erk and phospho-mTOR; these effects are more pronounced in CaP8 cells. Moreover, migration, invasion, clonogenic and soft agar colony formation assays revealed a striking synergism between PKC overexpression and Pten loss. Furthermore, analysis of global gene expression by microarray revealed significant changes in gene related to EMT, adhesion, metabolism, and invasiveness following PKC overexpression, Pten loss or both. In particular, a chemokine CXCL13 was found to be majorly up-regulated in CaP8-PKC cells. Measurement of CXCL13 mRNA by qPCR or CXCL13 release to the conditioned medium (CM) by ELISA showed increased levels in PKC overexpressing or Pten depleted cells, and these effects were synergistically enhanced in CaP8-PKC cells. Remarkably, CM from CaP8-PKC cells led to significant induction in growth and motility of P8 cells. Importantly, CXCL13 RNAi depletion reduced the proliferative and migratory capacity of CaP8-PKC cells, thereby establishing the potential relevance of CXCL13 in the phenotypic effects of PKC overexpression and Pten loss. Concurrently, the growth and motile activity of P8 cells were enhanced in response to exogenously added CXCL13. Overall, our results argue for the role of CXCL13 in mediating effects of oncogenic PKC in prostate cancer.']",

We recently recapitulated metastasis of Pten/ Trp53-mutant PC in mouse using the RapidCaP system and surprisingly, we found that it is driven by Myc, rather than Akt activation.Here, we show that cell-cell communication by Il6 drives this Akt-Myc switch through activation of the Akt-inactivating phosphatase Phlpp2. Primary cells revealed that loss of Pten/ Trp53 triggers secretion of the Il6 cytokine when these genes are deleted together, but not separately. Il6 then communicates a downstream program of Stat3-mediated Myc activation, which drives cell proliferation. Abrogation of Myc activity by Myc inhibition with the JQ1 bromodomain inhibitor, Myc-RNAi, and Myc-CRISPR/ Cas9 approaches inhibited proliferation. We validated these findings in vivo, where peak proliferation in Pten/ Trp53 mutant primary and metastatic PC did not correlate with activated Akt, but with Stat3/ Myc activation instead.

Previous studies indicated that deletion of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) gene is common to be found in bladder cancer. As known tumor suppressor gene PTEN is located on chromosome ten and considered as an important negative regulator for the PIP3⁄Akt signaling pathway to promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. Thus, this study we aimed to determine clinical significance of PTEN in UTUC. We collected sixty-eight formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) UTUC samples, the tumor stage was according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) with Ta (n=15), T1 (n=11), T2 (n=10), T3 (n=18), T4 (n=7) and seven patients with unknown; in which male no.32, female no.36; the median age is 68 y/o (range 40-85 y/o). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to exam the PTEN gene copy number or gene structure alterations of UTUC; besides, immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis were used to observe the PTEN protein expression in the tumor. Our results showed PTEN mutations were observed in twenty-two tumors with heterozygous PTEN deletion; one tumor with homozygous PTEN deletion, and three tumors with PTEN monosomy. Further, heterozygous PTEN deletion was shown significantly associated with stage of pTa, pT1 and pT2 (P=0.048) and history of smoking (P=0.030). The IHC results showed lower expression level was common to be observed in the tumor area. Our findings suggest loss of PTEN is associated with the low-risk group of UTUC but not the high-risk group, the unknown mechanisms between these two subtypes might be existed. Besides, smoking could also as a factor highly emerge from genetic alterations in UTUC.

        "Background":"['Mutations of multiple tumor suppressor genes, such as PTEN and p53, have been proposed to play important roles in the development of prostate cancer. Loss of one allele of PTEN occurs in 70-80% of human primary prostate tumors and homozygous inactivation of PTEN is associated with advanced disease. Similarly, p53 is found completely lost or mutated almost exclusively in advanced human prostate cancer. Thus, selective killing of prostate cancer cells harboring mutations of PTEN and p53 may prove to be a promising strategy for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. The Warburg effect of aerobic glycolysis has now been generally accepted as a key metabolic hallmark of cancer. In this study, we investigated the molecular target leading to the Warburg effect in the growth and aggressiveness of prostate cancer cells harboring inactivation of PTEN and p53 and delineated the underlying mechanism. We identified that expression of hexokinase II (HK2), an enzyme involved in the first step of glycolysis, is preferentially elevated in human prostate cancer cells bearing mutations of both PTEN and p53 (PC3). Functional studies demonstrated that HK2 expression is crucial for the Warburg effect in PC3 cells and knockdown of HK2 inhibits tumor growth in PC3 xenograft mouse model. These novel findings prompted us to test whether 2-de-oxyglucose (2-DG), an inhibitor of HK2, could potentially suppress prostate cancer growth by targeting the Warburg effect. We found that an induction of AMPK-dependent autophagy prevents cancer cells from apoptosis upon 2-DG treatment, thereby limiting therapeutic efficacy on prostate cancer in vivo. Consistent with cell survival function of autophagy, its inhibition by chloroquine (a small molecule inhibitor of autophagy) or individual knockdown of the essential genes involved in autophagy (Atg5, Atg7, Beclin1, and ULK1) induced massive cell death when combined with 2-DG. This cell death can be rescued by overexpression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 or downregulation of pro-apoptotic protein Bax in PC3. More importantly, we demonstrated that combination of chloroquine and 2-DG could specifically kill prostate cancer cells, leaving normal prostate epithelial cells untouched. This specificity is due to the preferential induction of HK2 through the activated Rictor-AKT-mTOR pathway in cancer cells. Finally, combination of chloroquine and 2-DG caused synthetic lethality in prostate cancer cells and effectively suppressed tumor growth in PC3 xenograft mouse model. Towards therapeutic translation, we have observed that expression of HK2 by staining primary human prostate tumor samples with HK2 antibodies correlated with the stages of prostate cancer. Given our findings, we therefore propose that targeting the Warburg effect and autophagy pathways may serve as an effective and selective treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer, in particular those with PTEN and p53 mutations.']",

Inhibition of autophagy can promote senescence resulting in decreased tumor growth. Genetic alterations of PTEN and p53 are frequently present in advanced human prostate cancer and are associated with poor prognosis. In mouse models, the inactivation of PTEN leads to the development of prostate tumors that progress slowly, in part due to the induction of PTEN-(loss)-induced cellular senescence. Concomitant inactivation of both PTEN and P53 in prostate leads to the development of an aggressive cancer phenotype that can overcome PTEN-(loss)-induced cellular senescence and is characterized with accelerated growth, metastatic development and decreased survival.

In this study we assessed the effects of pharmacological inhibition of autophagy with chloroquine (CQ) on the growth and progression of mouse prostate tumors driven by the concomitant inactivation of PTEN and p53.

Its locus at 13q21 is frequently deleted in human prostate cancer, suggesting a tumor suppressor function. Our previous study showed that TGF-beta, which is a differentiation signal for normal proliferating progenitor cells, acetylates KLF5 to reverse its function. Unacetylated KLF5 (unAc-KLF5) is pro-proliferative but acetylated KLF5 (Ac-KLF5) works with TGF- to inhibit cell proliferation. Here we generated a Klf5-floxed mouse strain in which exons 2 and 3 of Klf5 are flanked by loxP sequences. By crossing Klf5-floxed mice with PB-Cre4 transgenic mice, we were able to delete the Klf5 gene specifically in prostatic epithelial cells. Because knockout of both Pten alleles induces prostate carcinoma, we also crossed Klf5-floxed mice with Pten-floxed mice to investigate Klf5 function in tumor progression. At different time points, prostates were collected and histological and molecular analyses were performed. We found that knockout of one Klf5 allele mainly increased cell proliferation and caused epithelial hyperplasia but was insufficient to initiate prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). On the other hand, knockout of both Klf5 alleles mainly induced apoptosis in prostate epithelia. When combined with Pten knockout, the apoptosis was prevented due to the activation of PI3K survival signaling, making Klf5 null cells survive. With the deletion of one Pten allele, Klf5 deletion significantly increased cell proliferation and promoted the development of hyperplasia and PIN. When both Pten alleles were deleted, Klf5 deletion significantly enhanced tumor development, as indicated by increased tumor size and elimination of luminal structures. Immunohistochemical staining proved that cell cycle regulator p15 was downregulated in Klf5 knockout mice. Deletion of Klf5 also significantly induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 MAPK and further increased Akt activity. In normal prostates, total Klf5 was detected in both luminal and basal cells of the prostate, while unAc-Klf5 and Ac-Klf5 were detected in basal and luminal cells respectively. In addition, oncogenic signals, such as Pten knockout, reduced Ac-Klf5 in differentiated luminal cells.

We used a genetically engineered mouse model of prostate cancer that is based on the PSA-Cre driven inactivation of PTEN to show that autophagy is induced during tumor progression and the transformation to castration resistant prostate cancer. We also report that inhibition of autophagy by the conditional inactivation of ATG7, a gene essential for autophagosome formation, does not contribute to initiate prostate cancer. However, simultaneous inactivation of ATG7 and PTEN leads to suppressed tumor progression in castration-nave and CRPC models. Additionally PTEN/ATG7 double gene knockout mice were more sensitive to targeted mTOR inhibition than PTEN single gene knockouts. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy using the lysomotropic agent chloroquine synergized with everolimus to inhibit survival of human and mouse prostate cancer cells in vitro. Despite a strong antitumor activity in vitro, the combinations of everolimus and chloroquine failed to demonstrate any meaningful improvement over everolimus alone when tested in vivo with PTEN-mutant mice. In summary, our findings demonstrate that autophagy is required for prostate cancer progression and contributes to therapeutic resistance; however, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy, using a lysomotropic agent, was ineffective in producing a meaningful antitumor benefit in an autochthonous cancer system.

CXCR4 is a G-Protein Coupled Receptor that is heavily implicated in the metastatic dissemination of prostate tumor cells to bone marrow. In cancer and other cell models, CXCR4 expression and activity increases in response to hypoxic environments and/or oxidative stress. Cells react by inducing expression of a HIF1 transcription factor, which enhances expression of targeted genes involved in adjusting to oxidative stress and cell survival. HIF1 has been shown to directly induce the expression of CXCR4 in prostate cancer cells. Therefore, generation of ROS in tumor tissues may critically influence CXCR4-mediated expression and functions, ultimately encouraging cancer progression. In this study, we elucidate a mechanism by which ROS induces CXCR4 expression and function in prostate cancer cells. We initially investigated the role of ROS on the phosphorylation of AKT (p-AKT) and ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) in DU145 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines. Using H2O2 as our model of ROS, we found that H2O2 induced a gradual expression of p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 by western blot analysis, which was abrogated by the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). It has been shown that PTEN is a negative regulator of AKT and ERK1/2 signaling, and that ROS accumulation inactivates PTEN phosphatase function; hence, we determined whether the increase in p-AKT and p-ERK1/2 expression was due to loss of PTEN function. By performing a phosphatase assay, we found that H2O2 inhibited PTEN catalytic activity compared to untreated cells, while NAC abrogated these effects in both cell lines. The increase in ROS and loss of PTEN has been shown to correlate with CXCR4-mediated function; therefore, we determined the role of H2O2 on CXCR4 expression. We found that H2O2 induced CXCR4 expression in DU145 cells, but not in 22Rv1 cells. Furthermore, we investigated whether ROS-mediated induction of CXCR4 was HIF1 dependent. Interestingly, H2O2 induced expression of HIF1 in DU145 cells, which was abrogated by siRNA for HIF1. HIF1 expression decreased in 22Rv1 cells, which correlated with apoptosis, as confirmed by Annexin-V analysis. Finally, we observed that the H2O2-mediated increase in CXCR4 enhanced transendothelial invasion and migration in DU145 cells in a CXCR4 dependent manner. Our study suggests that ROS differentially regulates CXCR4 expression and function in prostate cancer cells, suggesting that ROS plays a differential role on heterogeneous tumor mass.']",

We found miR-32 to be an androgen regulated miRNA which is differentially expressed in CRPC compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and able to provide a significant growth advantage to LNCaP cells by reducing apoptosisTo study how increased miR-32 expression contributes to prostate cancer formation and/or progression in vivo, and to search for in vivo targets of miR-32 in the prostate tissue, we have established transgenic mice expressing miR-32 specifically in the prostate. FVB/N mouse strain was used to create transgenic mice with probasin promoter (ARR2PB) driving expression of miR-32 androgen-responsively in prostate epithelium post-puberty. The mice develop and breed normally, and express the transgene specifically in the ventral and dorsolateral lobes of the prostate, with no transgene expression detected in anterior prostate or seminal vesicles up to six months of age. To provoke lesions in prostate epithelium, the miR-32 mice were cross-bred with mice heterozygous for tumor suppressor Pten. Histological analysis of the prostates of ARR2PB-miR-32xPten+/- mice shows increased number of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions in the dorsal prostate compared to Pten+/- mice. In addition, transgenic miR-32 can induce goblet cell metaplasia in prostate epithelium in lateral to ventral prostate, in addition to stromal responses, in the prostate in the Pten+/- background.In search for in vivo targets of miR-32, we have performed a gene expression microarray analysis comparing the wild type and ARR2PB-miR-32 prostate tissue. Several candidate targets have been identified, and will be discussed further for their potential cancer relevance.We find that miR-32 is potentially an important gene in the progression of prostate cancer and a putative drug target. We are currently analyzing histology of the miR-32 transgenic mouse prostates further, and assessing tissue targets of miR-32. With the transgenic mouse model, we aim to determine whether miR-32 is an oncomiR for prostate cancer in vivo, and will assess the potency of miR-32 as a therapeutic target.']",

Pre-treatment prostate biopsies were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for ERG rearrangement and overexpression, PTEN deletion and expression loss. Univariable and multivariable Cox-regression analyses evaluated association of ERG and PTEN status with biochemical recurrence (BCR).ResultsWithin a median follow-up of 73 months, 11% of patients experienced BCR. Of 80 samples with both IHC and FISH performed for ERG, 46 (57.8%) demonstrated rearrangement by FISH and 45 (56.3%) by IHC. Of 77 samples with both IHC and FISH for PTEN, 14 (18.2%) had PTEN deletion by FISH and 22 (28.6%) by IHC. No significant associations were found between ERG, PTEN status and clinicopathologic features. Patients with concurrent ERG rearrangement and PTEN deletion demonstrated significantly worse relapse-free survival rates compared to those with ERG or PTEN wild-type (p<0.01). In multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusted for the effects of standard clinicopathologic features, combined ERG rearranged and PTEN deletion was independently associated with BCR (HR 2.6, p=0.02).ConclusionsConcurrent ERG rearrangement and PTEN loss was independently associated with time to BCR in patients undergoing brachytherapy.

It is expected that specific signaling pathway-activating mutations like PTEN-loss will produce changes in the surface and secreted proteomes of the affected tissue and should be detectable as biomarker signatures in the serum. Methods', ' We applied a novel two-stage strategy for the discovery of PCa biomarker signatures corresponding to cancer-causing PTEN loss. First, we used quantitative proteomic technologies to identify 785 glycoproteins from sera and prostate tissue of wild-type and prostate-specific PTEN-null mice. Second, following bioinformatic prioritization, we quantified 48 human orthologue candidate biomarkers in sera of patients with PCa or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The resulting candidate protein profiles were used to compute highly predictive regression models. Results', ' We identified a 5-protein signature that correctly predicted 71% of cases belonging to patients having aberrant or normal PTEN status (sensitivity=68%, specificity=85%, AUC=0.85). In addition we identified a 3-protein signature that correctly predicted patients having tumors with a Gleason score  7(3+4) or  7(4+3) (AUC 0.92). Finally we found a 4-protein signature that discriminated between BPH and PCa with a sensitivity=78% and specificity=63% (AUC=0.74), in combination with PSA with a sensitivity=90% and specificity=83% (AUC=0.84). Conclusions', ' The identification of the 5-protein signature reflecting tissue PTEN status may aid in selecting patients to treat with inhibitors of the PI3K pathway. Combination of our 4-protein signature and PSA has a higher diagnostic sensitivity and specificity than PSA alone and therefore may improve the effectiveness of PCa screening.

        "Background":"['Interleukin-6 or IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine which is implicated in the regulation of immune response, but is also involved in regulating the growth of various malignant tumors. Mounting evidence suggests that IL-6 contributes to prostate cancer progression. Activated IL-6 has been shown to be elevated in the sera from patients with metastatic prostate cancer and it appears that the prostate tissue itself is a source of IL-6 and its receptor. Experimental data suggests that the IL-6/IL-6R signaling axis is an autocrine and paracrine growth factor in androgen independent prostate cancer cell lines and can activate a variety of signal transduction cascades, some of which may activate androgen receptor activity. In the present study we examined the role of IL6-induced Stat3 activation in the development and progression of prostate cancer and its possible role as a target for the treatment of prostate cancer using the prostate-specific conditional targeting PTEN knockout mouse model. In PTEN-mutant mice, elevated levels of IL6/IL-6R correlated with increased cellular proliferation in non-castrate and castrate prostate cancer (CRPC). Similar to human prostate cancer, mice with CPRC showed elevated levels of IL-6 and IL6-R in both serum and prostate tissue. To establish a therapeutic role for IL6/IL6R inhibition, we conducted a series of pharmacodynamic studies using an anti-mouse IL-6R antibody (MR-16) in tumor bearing homozygous PTEN-mutant mice. Our data shows that STAT3 activation was inhibited in a dose dependent manner during acute IL6-R blockade. Inhibition of STAT3 activity after chronic IL-6R blockade was transient. However, at day 45 of treatment, tumor cell proliferation was inhibited and apoptosis was induced. These findings show that this mouse model is relevant for the study of Stat3 signaling and tumor progression and inhibition of Stat3 transcriptional activation by upstream signal blockade may be a promising approach for molecularly targeted therapeutic strategies in human prostate cancer. Thus this study will serve as the foundation for future drug intervention studies designed to assess the efficacy of targeting the JAK/STAT signal pathway using targeted monotherapy and combination drug therapy models.']",

We examined PTEN protein expression using immunohistochemistry in 400 sporadic colorectal cancers with full clinical investigations and follow up data. PTEN mutations were studied using capture sequencing and Sanger sequencing validation. PTEN copy number alteration was carried out using Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (FISH). Of the all CRC tumours analysed 83/347 (24%) cases showed absence of PTEN staining, 189/347 (54.5%%) cases showed weak staining and remaining 75/347 (21.5%) cases showed staining similar to normal & internal positive control. 17 mutations in coding region of PTEN were identified in 13 (3.2%) CRC cases.

Interestingly when combining all PTEN alterations (protein expression loss, PTEN mutation and PTEN genomic deletion), it accounted for 97 (29.7%) CRC cases. Significant association of combined PTEN alterations was seen disease free survival (p = 0.0367). On multivariate analysis, this stands true (p = 0.0227) when adjusted for Age, Sex, Site, Grade and Stage. Thus, PTEN alteration is an independent marker of poor prognosis in CRC.

In the current study, we used the murine Pten knockout PCa model to evaluate the effect of pterostilbene (PTER) on MTA1-mediated events in PCa progression. Pterostilbene is a potent natural analogue of resveratrol with improved pharmacokinetic properties and superior pharmacological potency. The Pten conditional knockout mice that mimic human disease and provide fast stage-defined development of PCa were fed, starting at 3 weeks of age, with phytoestrogen-free diet AIN 76A and injected daily (i.p.) either with 10% DMSO (control, untreated) or with 10 mg/kg bw PTER until 6, 10, 15 and 25 weeks of age.

For protein analysis, mouse prostate dissection was performed to distinguish anterior prostate (AP) and dorso-latero-ventral (DLV) lobes. Our results showed that the PTER-treated group had a lower tumor grade and higher incidence of prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) at the expense of a substantial decrease in adenocarcinoma incidence. Prostate tissues from the PTER-treated group presented a decrese in Ki67 proliferation marker-positive cells and an increase in apoptosis. As potential mechanisms of PTER efficacy, 50-75% decrease in MTA1 and pAkt levels were observed at different time points. In addition, PTER inhibited androgen receptor (AR) expression, especially in the AP.

        "Background":"['Androgen ablation therapy is the standard treatment for advanced prostate cancer. While tumors initially respond to androgen deprivation, they almost always recur with an androgen-independent phenotype termed castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Castration-resistant tumors are incurable with current therapy regimens and account for most prostate cancer mortality. Better understanding of their biology is therefore critical for devising novel treatment options. Steroid Receptor Coactivator 3 (SRC-3) is a nuclear receptor coactivator that promotes growth of endocrine tissues. It enhances proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines and is highly expressed in advanced human prostate tumors. Despite this, the role of SRC-3 in CRPC is not well studied. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in most human prostate cancers. Mice harboring PTEN deletion in prostatic epithelial cells develop cancer that arises from progenitors in the luminal epithelial and basal compartments. Tumors histologically mimic advanced human disease and are castration-resistant. We hypothesized that, in prostate tumors caused by PTEN deletion, SRC-3 is a critical mediator for accelerating the development of CRPC. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice in which floxed PTEN and SRC-3 genes were concomitantly deleted in prostate epithelial cells via a Cre recombinase driven by the Probasin promoter. We first compared tumor mass, histology and biomarkers in these PTENf/f/SRC-3f/f/ARR2PBiCre (pten3cko) mice vs. PTENf/f/ARR2PBiCre (ptencko) mice. We found that while tumor growth in pten3cko mice was slightly inhibited at 9 wks of age, tumor histology and cellular composition were not markedly different. We then castrated mice of both genotypes at 9-wks-old and harvested tumors at 12wks. Interestingly, castrated ptencko mice had significantly worsened tumor aggressivenessas indicated by increased proliferation index, reduced differentiation (increased p63; decreased K5 and K8) and increased reactive stroma (double staining of SMA and vimentin)versus their non-castrated counterparts. Amazingly, in addition to significantly reducing tumor size, SRC-3 ablation reversed all changes comprising the aggressive phenotype seen in the post-castration tumors. Further investigation showed SRC-3 deletion decreased mTOR signaling. Together, these data show that castration induces a worse tumor phenotype in the setting of PTEN deletion and that SRC-3 promotes this process by inducing epithelial cell proliferation and enhancing the growth-promoting effect of these cells on the stroma. Therefore, SRC-3 may serve as a potential target for controlling CRPC development.']",

        "Background":"['IntroductionInactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor, a negative regulator of oncogenic PI3K/Akt signaling, occurs in a subset of melanomas and is correlated with disease progression, treatment resistance and reduced patient survival. PTEN loss of function in melanoma is thought to result largely from gene deletion, mutation and/or methylation. However, the low frequency of these genomic alterations cannot explain the higher rate of loss of PTEN protein expression that is observed in melanoma. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that loss of PTEN expression in melanoma might be the consequence of predominantly non-genomic mechanisms, including post-transcriptional and post-translational dysregulation. Specifically, we postulated that PTEN loss in some melanomas might result from aberrant expression of PTENP1, a PTEN pseudogene-derived long non-coding RNA, and from increased PTEN ubiquitination and hence protein degradation.Experimental ProceduresWe performed an integrated analysis of data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n = 276) and metastatic melanoma human specimens from patients enrolled at NYU (n = 48). We examined the frequency of PTEN copy number loss using genomic qPCR, PTEN mutations using targeted sequencing and qPCR mutation arrays, and PTEN methylation status was determined in tumors lacking PTEN deletion or mutation with bisulfite treatment and pyrosequencing. Furthermore, we assessed PTEN and PTENP1 expression in tumor samples by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry.ResultsComplete PTEN deletions were found in 8% of TCGA cases and in 10% of NYU cases, while partial PTEN deletions were detected in 27% of NYU cases. Somatic PTEN mutations were found in 8% of TCGA cases and 3% of NYU cases. The frequency of PTEN methylation at five CpG islands ranged between 0% and 28% and did not predict PTEN protein expression, thus identifying a subset of tumors that exhibit PTEN protein loss despite a lack of detectable PTEN deletions, mutations or methylation. Integration of PTEN and PTENP1 expression data from TCGA and the NYU cohort revealed a strong positive correlation between PTEN and PTENP1 levels in melanoma. Analysis of a role for aberrant PTEN ubiquitination in promoting PTEN loss in melanoma is ongoing.ConclusionsOur data challenge the existing model in which PTEN loss in melanoma is thought to occur primarily as a result of gene deletion, mutation or methylation. Rather, we find that these are uncommon events in melanoma and that PTEN loss may instead be attributed to post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms, such as dysregulation by loss of the PTENP1 long non-coding RNA. A comprehensive understanding of these non-genomic processes could identify novel approaches (PTEN-restoring therapy) to block tumor progression and improve treatment responses and patient survival, suggesting that suppression of PTEN levels in melanoma might be reversible and thus could be exploited clinically.']",
