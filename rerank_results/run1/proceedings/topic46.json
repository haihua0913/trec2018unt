FGFR1 FISH assay was performed on the tissue microarray using FISH probe that hybridized to the band 8p12-8p11.23 (FISH probes were provided by Abbott Molecular, Abbott Park, IL).Results', ' Thirty-two patients with limited-stage disease (LD) and eighty-one patients with extensive-stage disease (ED) were enrolled. Fourteen patients were female. Among 113 tumor samples, 5 samples (4.4%) showed FGFR1 amplification. All 5 samples were obtained from the patients with ED. The patients with FGFR1 amplification more frequently had pleural metastasis at the time of diagnosis (80% vs. 26%, P=0.022). In ED, the patients with FGFR1 amplification represented shorter disease free survival from first line chemotherapy (Hazard ratio [HR], 4.469; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.600-12.483; P=0.004) and second line chemotherapy (HR, 6.533; 95% CI, 1.700-25.108; P=0.006) than the patients without FGFR1 amplification in multivariate analysis.

Signaling through fibroblast growth factors (FGF2, FGF9) and their high-affinity receptor (FGFR1) has recently emerged as a contributing factor in the pathogenesis and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, knowledge of FGFR1 and ligand expression in SCLC is limited.Methods', \" FGFR1 gene copy number, mRNA levels and protein expression were determined by silver in situ hybridization (SISH), mRNA ISH and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in primary tumors from 78 SCLC patients. Expression of the ligands FGF2 and FGF9 mRNA and protein were determined by mRNA ISH and IHC, respectively. Spearman's correlations were conducted using SAS 9.4.Results\", ' FGFR1 protein expression by IHC demonstrated a significant correlation with FGFR1 gene copy number (p = 0.03) and FGFR1 mRNA levels (p<0.0001). The positivity of FGFR1 mRNA in the SCLC cohort was 21%. FGFR1 mRNA expression correlated with both FGF2 (p = 0.0001) and FGF9 (p = 0.0018) mRNA levels, as well as with FGF2 (0.0105) and FGF9 (0.0012) protein levels. There was no significant association between FGFR1 and ligands with clinical characteristics or prognosis.Conclusions', ' FGFR1 amplification and mRNA levels correlate with FGFR1 protein expression. The SCLC cohort has a substantially higher proportion of FGFR1 mRNA positive cases (21%) compared to FGFR1 gene copy number positive cases (7.8%). Combined analysis of FGFR1 and ligand expression may be valuable to determine which SCLC patients may respond to FGFR1 inhibitor therapy.Key Words', ' small cell lung cancer; FGFR1; FGF2; FGF9']",

There are currently no established targeted therapies that take advantage of SqCCL-specific genetic abnormalities.  Amplification of the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 1 gene (FGFR1) has been identified as a driver event in breast cancers and in SqCCL. The demographic characteristics and prognosis of patients with these tumors remains to be defined.  Methods', '  DNA from 123 surgically resected, fresh frozen, and clinically annotated SqCCLs was extracted using a resin-based or phenol-based  methodology.  DNA quantity and quality was assessed using the Quantifiler kit (ABI).  Specimen histology was validated, and the proportion of tumor cells was >60%.  Copy number variation (CNV) analysis was performed using quantitative PCR with primers specific for exons 12 and 16 of FGFR1 and data analysis using CopyCaller (ABI).  Samples with a predicted CNV of at 2 or greater in at least one exon were scored as amplified.   Chi-squared tests were used to examine clinical and demographic differences between patients with and without amplification of FGFR1.  Survival differences were examined by Kaplan Meier and Cox regression models.   Results', '  Men comprised the majority of the population (n=91, 74%) and most cases were pathological stage I (n=75, 61%) or stage II (n=32, 26%).  Thirty (24.4%) tumors showed amplification of FGFR1.  There was no association between amplification and sex (p=0.18) or stage (p=0.37).

SOX2 amplification has been reported in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that, upon activation, promotes cell proliferation, survival and apoptotic resistance through PLC/PKC, RAS/MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, respectively. FGFR1 is also amplified in 15-25% of lung SCC and pre-clinical data with targeted inhibitors showed a growth dependency on FGFR1 amplification either in vitro and in vivo. A clinical trial with BIBF1120 (which also inhibits FGFR1), will be developed in the Netherlands and Spain in second line SCC of the lung with FGFR1 amplified by FISH. Genetic heterogeneity in solid tumors is a major research area and therefore its assessment in SCC of the lung is of great relevance.We have examined FGFR1 and SOX2 gene copy number (GCN) in 76 lung SCC by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Analysis of mutations in DDR2, PIK3CA, BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, and TP53 is ongoing.Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from enriched tumor cells by laser captured microdisection from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue sections. 50-100 ng of gDNA was analyzed in each of the three independent replicates per tumor sample. Two independent probe sets were used for each gene analyzed. For inter-patient GCN value comparisons, the tumor results from each patient was normalized against the GCN values derived from FFPE peripheral blood leukocytes control. We also used MLPA technique to study intra-tumor heterogeneity (TH) by analyzing FGFR1 and SOX2 in different tumor areas. In particular, in 4 cases FGFR1 and SOX2 were co-amplified. Also, TH was examined in serial tumor biopsies and/or resections obtained at different points of disease progression in two patients.Of the 76 patients evaluable for FGFR1 and SOX2 GCN, FGFR1 high amplification was detected in 13/76 (17.10%) and low amplification in 7/76 (9.21%). SOX2 presented high amplification in 38/63 (60.32%) and low amplification in 9/63 (14.28%). Interestingly, 46.15% of the FGFR1-amplified tumors were also co-amplified for SOX2. An important degree of TH was found in 2 of the 4 tumors analyzed. GCN changes in FGFR1, SOX2, PIK3CA, PDGFRa, KDR, EGFR and MET over 10 years follow-up will be presented for one surgically resected SCC lung cancer patient. Frequencies of FGFR1 and SOX2 gene amplifications detected are in agreement with previously published data. Survival according to FGFR1 and SOX2 status will also be presented. FGFR1 and SOX2 co-amplification, together with the TH, warrants further research and could represent a novel therapeutic target.']",

        "Background":"['Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women in the world. FGFR receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway has been implicated in tumor cell growth, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Activation of the FGFR pathway via FGFR over-expression, and chromosomal amplification and translocation as well as genetic mutation contributes to the tumor progression and the resistance to anti-EGFR and -VEGF treatment in lung cancer. Targeting FGFR pathway is therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy for lung cancer. We have discovered and developed a novel, ATP competitive and orally active small molecule inhibitor of FGFR, LY2874455, currently in clinic development. LY2874455 is a potent inhibitor against four FGFRs, and demonstrates a broad-spectrum of anti-tumor activity in a number of tumor xenograft models. In the current study, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of LY2874455 in lung tumor cells with or without FGFR1 gene amplification. FGFR1 is known to be amplified in human lung cancer cells NCI-H1581, NCI-H520 and DMS-114, but not in NCI-H460, A549 and NCI-H1299. The mRNA expression levels of FGFR1 are shown to be higher in the FGFR1 amplified cells than those in the FGFR1 non-amplified cells. Consistent with this, the FGFR1 amplified cells exhibited the much more robust b-FGF-induced phosphorylation of FRS2 and ERK, which are also more sensitive to the inhibition by LY2874455 than that in the FGFR1 non-amplified cells. Furthermore, the FGFR1 amplified cells exhibit the better responses to the growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by LY2874455 than those in the FGFR1 non-amplified cells. Therefore, these findings suggest that FGFR1 plays an important role in lung cancer cell growth and survival, and that LY2874455 may provide a promising treatment option for some lung cancer patients whose tumor harbors FGFR1 gene amplification. The in vivo anti-tumor response of LY2874455 is being further investigated in the tumor xenograft models derived from these FGFR1 amplified or non-amplified human lung cancer cells.']",

        "Background":"['Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in industrialized countries. In 2010, it is estimated that cancer of the lung and bronchus will be responsible for 157,300 deaths in the US (Jermal et al. 2010). A number of recent publications have reported the genomic amplification of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene (FGFR1) in lung cancer (Weiss et al. 2010; Voortman et al. 2010). Subtype analysis indicates that approximately 22% of squamous non-small cell lung cell carcinomas (NSCLC) and 27-33% of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) have amplification of the FGFR1 gene. Amplification of the FGFR1 gene in lung cancer cell lines is associated with over-expression of the FGFR1 receptor protein and increased signaling through the FGFR1 pathway resulting in increased cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. HGS1036 (formerly FP-1039) is a soluble fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human FGFR1 isoform -IIIc linked to the Fc region of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). HGS1036 acts as a ligand trap that sequesters multiple fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family ligands, blocking their ability to bind to and activate multiple FGF receptors. We investigated the preclinical efficacy of HGS1036 in preclinical lung cancer models with genomic FGFR1 amplification as a novel therapeutic strategy. A panel of lung cancer cell lines (n=5) were identified that displayed genomic FGFR1 amplification on chromosome 8. Two of the cell lines, DMS53 and DMS114, were derived from the tumors of patients with SCLC. The other three cell lines, NCI-H1581, NCI-H520 and NCI-H1703, were derived from the tumors of patients with NSCLC. Examination of in vitro drug sensitivity indicated that all 5 cell lines were sensitive to HGS1036. Treatment of NCI-H1581, NCI-H520, NCI-H1703, DMS53 and DMS114 cells with HGS1036 in vitro resulted in a 52%, 71%, 46%, 47% and 82% reduction in cell proliferation, respectively, as determined by CellTiterGlo. Sensitivity to HGS1036 in vitro generally correlated with FGFR1 copy number and total FGFR1 protein expression. HGS1036 treatment of mice bearing FGFR1 amplified lung cancer xenografts resulted in tumor growth inhibition in all five FGFR1-amplified models examined (p=<0.01). The degree of tumor growth inhibition, as assessed by area-under-the-curve analysis, varied from 31-84% depending on the FGFR1 amplified lung model examined. These experiments demonstrate that lung tumor cell lines with genomic FGFR1 amplification can be sensitive to FGF-ligand blockade by HGS1036 and provide preclinical rationale for the clinical study of HGS1036 in the treatment of lung cancer.']",

FGFR1, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the FGFR1 gene in chromosome 8p12 is involved in cell cycle, differentiation, survival, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. In SCLC, FGF/FGFR pathway is known to induce proliferation, disrupt apoptosis and mediate chemo-resistance. Pharmacologic FGFR inhibition in SCLC reduces proliferation and increases apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. We and others have reported high copy number gains (CNG) in cytogenetic bands encoding FGFR1 in SCLC suggesting that FGFR1 may be driver mutation and a potential therapeutic target in SCLC. In this study we further characterize FGFR1 as a therapeutic target in SCLC.Methods', ' Thirteen SCLC cell lines, 16 SCLC patient samples, and 14 SCLC tumors from commercially available tissue microarray (TMA) were screened for copy number alterations using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and focal FGFR1 amplifications using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In the cell lines, FGFR1 exons were sequenced from genomic DNA, mRNA expression evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction and protein expression determined semi-quantitatively using western blot. Growth inhibition assays were performed using PD173074, a selective FGFR inhibitor and standard cytotoxic agents (cisplatin and etoposide) to determine the correlation between FGFR1 expression and drug sensitivity.Results', ' CNG was detected in 10/16 (63%) patient samples and in 5/14 (36%) of tumors from TMA (range 4-9 copies per cell). 5/13 (38%) of cell lines demonstrated CNG, but we found no FGFR1 mutations or focal amplifications in SCLC cell lines. FGFR1 mRNA expression did not correlate with CNG and the FGFR1 protein expression was unrelated to the mRNA expression. FGFR1 CNG predicted sensitivity to PD173074 with cell lines carrying higher copy numbers being more sensitive. No such correlation was detected between FGFR1 mRNA expression and PD173074 sensitivity. Higher FGFR1 mRNA expression was associated with etoposide resistance.Conclusion', ' FGFR1 protein expression in SCLC cell lines is unrelated to copy number alterations and mRNA expression. CNG of 8p12 region which encodes FGFR1 predicts sensitivity to PD173074, a selective FGFR inhibitor.']",

This is a consequence of differentially expressed genes among these two histologies. According to this, analysis of FGFR1 mRNA expression of a cohort of lung cancer patients revealed that high FGFR1 mRNA expression was associated to a shorter overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in lung SCC patients.

Amplification of the FGFR1 gene was described in various cancer types. Clinical phase I trials are currently performed to address the potential applicability of anti-FGFR1-drugs in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Prevalence and clinical significance of FGFR1 amplification are unknown in esophageal carcinoma.Material and MethodsIn this study, six hundred formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from patients with esophageal carcinoma were analysed, including 346 patients with adenocarcinoma and 254 patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Dual-labeling Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was applied using probes for FGFR1 and centromere 8. The initial analysis was in a tissue microarray (TMA) format. All available tumor blocks from amplified tumors were subsequently analysed for heterogeneity on large sections. When available, lymph node metastases and tumor-adjacent dysplasia were also analysed on large sections from these tumors,ResultsFGFR1 amplification was more frequently seen in squamous cell carcinoma (9.4% of 202 interpretable cases) than in adenocarcinoma (1.6% of 308). High polysomy was found in an additional 5.9% of squamous cell carcinoma and 0.6% of adenocarcinoma. FGFR1 amplification was significantly associated with histologic grade (p=0.02) but was unrelated to tumor type, pT, pN, pM, UICC stage and survival. FGFR1 amplification was homogeneous across the tumor in most cases. FGFR1 heterogeneity was observed in only 3 of 24 cases. FGFR1 amplification was similarly observed in the primary tumor and in 6 cases each of lymph node metastases and dysplasia.SummaryIn conclusion, FGFR1 amplification in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus occurs at similar frequencies as in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. The high homogeneity of FGFR1 in the primary tumor and the lack of discordant results in dysplasia argue for FGFR1 amplification, representing an early alteration in a subgroup of esophageal cancers. The high homogeneity of FGFR1 amplification provides further arguments for FGFR1 representing an interesting drug target in these cancers.']",

In advanced-stage STS, conventional chemotherapy provides symptom palliation but not prolonged survival, which typically ranges from 11-15 months after development of distant metastases. Thus, there is an urgent need for more effective, well-tolerated and targeted STS therapies. Alterations of the FGFR1 receptor tyrosine kinase are under investigation as biomarker of FGFR inhibitor sensitivity in several epithelial cancers. Prompted by the detection of high-level FGFR1 amplification in a patient with metastatic leiomyosarcoma through clinical exome sequencing, we investigated the role of FGFR1 as oncogenic driver and potential drug target in STS. Specific aims were to (i) determine the frequency of FGFR1 amplification and overexpression in adult STS, (ii) evaluate the sensitivity of FGFR1-altered STS cells to genetic and pharmacologic FGFR1 inhibition, and (iii) delineate the signaling pathways engaged by FGFR1 in these cells.Experimental design', ' The frequency of FGFR1 amplification and overexpression was established in a cohort of patients with treatment-nive high-grade STS using array-based comparative genomic hybridization and mRNA expression profiling, respectively, and results were validated using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). FGFR1 dependence was assessed in STS cell lines with and without FGFR1 alteration through RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown and selective small-molecule FGFR inhibitors. FGFR ligand and pharmacologic inhibitors were employed to dissect FGFR signaling in FGFR1-altered STS cells.Results', ' FGFR1 amplification and overexpression were present in 31% and 34% of cases in the untreated high-grade STS cohort (n = 176) and in 16% and 15% of cases in the TCGA cohort (n = 256). Interestingly, FGFR1 overexpression was detected in a substantial proportion of caseswith no amplification (high-grade sarcoma cohort, 26%; TCGA cohort, 6.6%) comprising seven STS subtypes. Functional studies employing RNAi and different FGFR inhibitors (PD173074, AZD4547, BGJ398) demonstrated that the degree of dependence on FGFR1 for proliferation, survival, and anchorage-independent growth was primarily determined by FGFR1 expression levels. Furthermore, we identified the MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling axis as critical FGFR1 effector pathway whose suppression dictates the sensitivity of FGFR1-driven STS cells to FGFR-targeted therapy.Conclusions', ' FGFR1 amplification and overexpression are frequent events in multiple STS subtypes, and high FGFR1-expressing STS cells are sensitive to FGFR inhibition. These findings support FGFR1 as novel therapeutic target in STS and point to FGFR1 overexpression as a more reliable biomarker of sensitivity to FGFR pathway inhibition than genomic amplification, which might be of value for enrichment of future clinical trial populations.']",

        "Background":"['Liver metastasis is one of the main cause of death among patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, accurate prediction of liver metastasis of CRC is difficult at the inception of diagnosis. Activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are the main mediators of the signaling pathway related to cell survival, proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis. To determine if any of these RTKs are involved in liver metastasis from CRC, we performed phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array with matched 20 colon normal mucosa, primary tumor, metastatic liver tumor, and liver normal tissue proteins using Human Phospho-RTK Array (2009 AACR, #4951). In RTK activation profiling, FGFR1 activation was increased in a high proportion of metastatic liver tumor (p < 0.05). To evaluate the functional roles of FGFR1, DLD-1 and LoVo colon cancer cells were treated with FGFR1 specific siRNA or RTK inhibitor. Inhibition of FGFR1 inhibited phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT and ERK, a downstream cellular signaling molecule of FGFR; whereas, mTOR, p70S6K, JNK and Src activities were not affected. Also, we compared the cell migration and invasion ability by wound healing assay and invasion assay. The invasion capacity and wound closing were significantly delayed by FGFR1 inhibition (p <0.05). To evaluate in vivo anti-metastatic effect of FGFR1, we used an orthotropic liver metastasis model, generated by injecting LoVo colon cancer cells into spleen of BALB/c nu/nu mice. In control group, multiple large metastatic foci were evident, whereas the extent of liver metastasis was dramatically reduced in TKI-258 (50mg/kg/d) treated group (48.9%, p<0.05). Immunoexpression of the p-FGFR1 was much more intense in control than TKI-258 treated tumor tissues.

FGFR1 gene amplification is found in 10% of ER+ breast cancers, where it is associated with early recurrence on endocrine therapy. FGFR1 amplification has been reported in 30-40% of breast tumors with CCDN1 amplification; co-amplification of these genes is associated with shorter patient survival. We investigated the mechanisms by which FGFR1 amplification confers endocrine resistance.Results', ' We used ER+ human breast cancer cell lines with (MDA-134, CAMA-1, HCC1500) or without (MCF7, ZR75-1) FGFR1 amplification. In these cells, we investigated the effect of FGFR1 silencing with siRNA or pharmacological inhibition using the small molecule lucitanib on cell growth, ER transcriptional activity and the interaction of FGFR1 and ER.Both FGFR1 siRNA and treatment with lucitanib reduced ER transcriptional reporter activity and proliferation of ER+/FGFR1 amplified cell lines. Conversely, addition of FGF3 and FGF19 ligands stimulated ER reporter activity in estrogen-free medium, suggesting FGFR activation regulates ER activity. FGFR1 signaling is mainly transduced to the PI3K/AKT and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways by the adaptor FRS2. Neither siRNA against FRS2 nor pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K (BKM120) and MEK (GSK1120212) reduced ER transcriptional activity in ER+/FGFR1 amplified cells, suggesting a FRS2 independent, FGFR1-ER direct interaction explaining the inhibitory effect of FGFR1 siRNA and lucitanib on ER function. MDA-134, CAMA-1 and HCC1500 FGFR1 amplified cell lines also harbor CCND1 amplification. Further, nuclear FGFR1 has been shown to regulate target gene expression, including CCND1. Therefore, we next examined if nuclear FGFR1 and cyclin D1 interact with ER. In ER or cyclin D1 antibody pulldowns from whole cell lysates and nuclear extracts of MDA-134, CAMA-1 and HCC1500 cells, ER co-precipitated with FGFR1 and cyclin D1. The associations of ER with FGFR and of ER with cyclin D1 were not inhibited upon blockade of the FGFR1 tyrosine kinase with lucitanib. However, the association of FGFR1 with cyclin D1 was inhibited by lucitanib treatment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of DNA protein crosslinks in CAMA-1 cells  estradiol with a FGFR1 antibody showed that FGFR1 binds to different estrogen response elements (ERE) in DNA. This FGFR1-ERE association was abrogated by treatment with lucitanib, suggesting it depended on an active FGFR1 tyrosine kinase.Conclusions', ' These data suggest FGFR1 binds ER and regulates ligand-independent ER transcriptional activity. This role depends on the FGFR1 kinase activity and may involve its association with cyclin D1. These interactions may explain the endocrine resistance reported in ER+/FGFR1 amplified breast cancers and suggest these tumors should be treated with a combination of antiestrogen and FGFR inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['The majority of Pancreatic cancer (PaCA) patients present with metastatic disease and receive little benefit from chemotherapy. Although nanoparticulate carriers can potentially deposit sustained and high doses of chemotherapeutics in tumors, PaCA tumors are poorly perfused, which limits drug deposition. Ten days of oral dosing with NVP-LDE225 (40 mg/kg), an inhibitor of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway (sHHI), increased tumor deposition of blood-borne, fluorescently labeled, sterically-stabilized lipidic (SSL) nanoparticles by enhancing the perfusion and permeability of the otherwise-impermeable microvasculature of PaCA patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors. However, literature indicates sHH ablation is associated with increased Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal (EMT) transition and invasiveness in PaCA. Here we investigated the compensatory role of FGFR1 in sHHI-induced tumor progression. Four to 8 daily treatments with the sHHI resulted in no significant reduction of tumor volume, but markedly increased the ratio of tumor cells (human mitochondria+) to Collagen1 in the stroma, in two s.c. low-passage PDX models of varying stromal content. Immunostaining of sHHI-treated tumors revealed no alteration in total FGFR1 expression, but showed a significant elevation in the (1) percent of FGFR1+ pixels correlating with DAPI+ nuclei in tumor (human mitochondria+) cells and stromal cells, (2) number of vimentin+ (EMT) cells, and (3) proliferative index marked by Ki67+ nuclei, compared to controls, suggesting accelerated tumor progression. Nuclear FGFR1 was associated with vimentin+ cells, but was excluded from the nuclei of Ki67+ cells in all groups, implicating nuclear translocation of FGFR1 in EMT. NVP-BGJ398, a small-molecule pan-FGFR inhibitor (FGFRI), administered p.o. for 3 days (15 mg/kg/day) after 7d of sHHI-pretreatment (1) significantly reduced nuclear localization of FGFR1 compared to sHHI-treated animals, (2) reversed the ratio of human mitochondria+ tumor cells to Collagen 1+ stroma, (3) depleted vimentin+ structures by >2 fold, and (4) reduced Ki67+ cells to control levels. FGFRI without sHHI-pretreatment resulted in decreased nuclear FGFR1 relative to controls, but did not impact proliferation, EMT, or tumor cell-to-stroma ratio. Finally, the sHHI/FGFRI sequence increased functional (FITC-L. esculentum lectin+) tumor vessel density and area the perfused by vascular permeability probes (fluorescent SSL) compared to both controls and sHHI-treated animals. FGFRI administration in vehicle-treated controls had no impact on vascular permeability or perfusion. We conclude that the combination of sHHI in sequence with FGFRI may reverse potentially deleterious effects of sHHI and mediate a transient enhancement of tumor permeability, and increase deposition and penetration of nanoparticulate SSL drug formulations into pancreatic cancers.']",

        "Background":"['Both vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) singling pathways can mediate tumor angiogenesis. Colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) plays an important role on functions of macrophages. Recently the roles of the VEGFR, FGFR and CSF1R in regulation of T cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, thereby increasing tumor immune evasion, have been demonstrated[1-3]. Therefore, blockade of tumor angiogenesis and tumor immune evasion by simultaneously targeting VEGFR, FGFR and CSF1R kinases may represent a promising approach for anti-cancer therapy. We report here the preclinical studies for sulfatinib (HMPL-012), a potent and highly selective small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor against VEGFR, FGFR1 and CSF1R. Sulfatinib inhibited VEGFR1, 2, and 3, FGFR1 and CSF1R kinases with IC50s in a range of 1~24 nM, and it strongly blocked VEGF induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation in HEK293KDR cells and CSF1 stimulated CSF1R phosphorylation in RAW264.7 cells with IC50 of 2 and 79 nM, respectively. Sulfatinib also attenuated VEGF or FGF stimulated HUVEC cells proliferation with IC50 < 50 nM. In animal studies, a single oral dosing of sulfatinib inhibited VEGF stimulated VEGFR2 phosphorylation in lung tissues of nude mice in an exposure-dependent manner. Furthermore, elevation of FGF23 levels in plasma 24 hours post dosing suggested suppression of FGFR signaling. Sulfatinib demonstrated potent tumor growth inhibition in multiple human xenograft models and decreased CD31 expression remarkably, suggesting strong inhibition on angiogenesis through VEGFR and FGFR signaling. In a syngeneic murine colon cancer model CT-26, sulfatinib demonstrated moderate tumor growth inhibition after single agent treatment. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry analysis revealed an increase of CD8+ T cells and a significant reduction in TAMs, (CD163+ or F4/80+CD11b+CD45+) and CSF1R+ TAMs in tumor tissue indicating strong effect on CSF1R. Interestingly, combination of sulfatinib with a PD-L1 antibody resulted in enhanced anti-tumor effect. These results suggested that sulfatinib has a strong effect in modulating angiogenesis and cancer immunity. In summary, sulfatinib is a novel angio-immuno kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR, FGFR1 and CSF1R kinases that could simultaneously block tumor angiogenesis and immune evasion. This unique feature seems to support sulfatinib as an attractive candidate for exploration of possible combinations with checkpoint inhibitors against various cancers.

        "Background":"['Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Failure of treatment is attributed to recurrence, metastasis, and chemotherapeutic resistance. Previous studies have demonstrated that the transcription factor brachyury is a potential regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and plays a role in tumor resistance to conventional antitumor therapies. However, the mechanisms underlining brachyury-induced EMT are unknown. Recent studies have revealed that fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/ fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling is activated in lung cancer, and suppression of FGFR results in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. Here we investigated the role of FGFR signaling, a critical component of mesoderm induction during normal embryogenesis and a regulator of normal brachyury expression, in brachyury-driven lung cancer. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western Blot analysis showed that the chemotherapy-insensitive/metastatic lung cancer cell line H460 and adenocarcinoma tissues in patients had significantly high expressions of brachyury and FGFR1, 3 and 4 compared to the chemotherapy-sensitive/non-metastatic lung cancer cell line H440 and normal tissues adjacent to tumor. To further explore the association between FGFR and brachyury expression and its function, we specifically silenced FGFR using siRNAs for FGFR1, 2, 3 and 4 in H460 cells or overexpressed FGFR1, 3 and 4 in H441 cells. We found that only FGFR1 inhibition led to suppression of brachyury, whereas overexpression of FGFR1 induced brachyury expression, suggesting that brachyury is a potential target of FGFR1. Immunofluorescence staining and RT-PCR showed that silencing of FGFR1 led to inhibitions of brachyury and EMT (an increased epithelial marker E-cadherin expression and decreased mesenchymal biomarker Snail expression) in H460 cells. Overexpression of FGFR1 promoted EMT in H441 cells, but this effect was suppressed by concomitant knockdown of brachyury. In addition, the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) inhibitor, PD184352, suppressed FGF1-upregulated brachyury and Snail expressions and invasion in H460 cells. PD184352 also inhibited FGFR1 overexpression-induced brachyury expression, EMT and invasion in H440 cells, indicating an important regulatory role of FGFR1 in brachyury-driven EMT through MAPK/ERK. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of brachyury-driven EMT and highlight the FGFR1/MAPK/ERK pathway as a new therapeutic target for brachyury-driven lung cancer.']",

However, early clinical trials show that response rate of FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (FGFR-TKIs) is 20-30% in patients with FGFR1 amplified lung cancer. To elucidate the reason for de novo resistance to FGFR-TKI, six FGFR1 amplified lung cancer cell lines (NCI-H1581, DMS-114, NCI-H520, NCI-H1703, HCC95, and Calu-3) were analyzed. These cells were confirmed to have FGFR1 amplification by FISH analysis. Cell viability assay showed only 2 of six cell lines, NCI-H1581 and DMS-114, are sensitive to a FGFR-TKI, BGJ-398. Among BGJ-398 insensitive cells, NCI-H1703, HCC95, and Calu-3 cells express low mRNA and protein level of FGFR1 even in the presence of FGFR1 amplification. In addition, while BGJ-398 downregulates ERK phosphorylation in FGFR1 protein expressing cells, the drug had no effect on ERK signaling in BGJ-398 resistant cells with low FGFR1 protein expression. Importantly, other driver oncogenes were found in these BGJ-398 insensitive cell lines. PDGFRa amplification in H1703 cells and HER2 amplification in Calu-3 cells were reported previously. In this study, we have also found ERBB3 ligand NRG1 was overexpressed in HCC95 cells. Knockdown of NRG1 suppressed cell growth and combination of lapatinib with BGJ-398 led to cell death. To further determine whether FGFR1 protein expression is enough for the sensitivity to FGFR-TKIs, lung cancer cell lines were screened to FGFR-TKIs, BGJ-398 and PD-173034. This screen identified that all FGFR-TKI sensitive cell lines harbor FGFR1 amplification with high protein expression. These results suggest FGFR-TKIs should be used to patients harboring both FGFR1 amplification and protein expression. In case tumors with FGFR1 amplification, but expressing low FGFR1 protein, another driver oncogene may coexist and targeting both FGFR1 and these coexisting driver oncogenes are required to treat these tumors.']",

Here we show the first crystal structures of the FGFR1 gatekeeper mutation, V561M FGFR1, and use kinetic and structural methods to explore the mechanisms of the catalytic activation we observe for this mutation. We show that while the FGFR1 gatekeeper mutation confers resistance to two inhibitors currently in clinical trials, the extent of change in efficacy differ, indicating two unique resistance profiles. We show that some affinity for one inhibitor is maintained by the V561M mutation due to a flexible linker that allows multiple binding conformations. This is the first example showing the same inhibitor binding in unique ways to the WT and gatekeeper mutant forms of FGFR, highlighting some regions of drug design flexibility both within the binding pocket and in the linker of the inhibitor.

To further elucidate the biological differences between ER high/PR low versus ER low/PR high expressing lung tumors, a mRNA microarray analysis using the Illumina HT-12 V4 Bead Chip platform was performed using RNA extracted from 64 cases. 165 genes were differentially expressed between these two groups at P<001. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) was a highly over-expressed gene associated with ER high tumors (2.1-fold, P<0.004), while the decoy receptor for FGFR ligands, fibroblast growth factor receptor like-1 (FGFR5), was down-regulated (0.54-fold, P<0.0001). Ingenuity Pathway analysis revealed a network among the 165 differentially expressed genes that linked FGFR1 and FGFR5 to the ER. To analyze cross-talk between the FGF and E2 pathways, we determined the FGF/FGFR profile in a panel of three FGFR1 amplified and five non-amplified NSCLC cell lines. FGF2, 3, 10, and 19 were the most highly secreted FGFs in the cell line panel. FGFR1 amplified cells secreted statistically more FGF3, 6 and 10 compared to non-amplified cells. -estradiol (E2) induced secretion of FGF2 in a cell line without FGFR1 amplification. FGFR3 and 5 were ubiquitously expressed across all cell lines while FGFR1, 2 and 4 expression was higher in amplified cell lines. There was no relationship between ER protein expression and FGFR1 amplification status or FGFR1-5 protein expression. Because FGF signaling has been shown to increase stem cell-like phenotypes in breast cancer, we determined basal and E2-stimulated expression of the stem cell markers, SOX2 and OCT4. Basal SOX2 and OCT4 were more highly expressed in FGFR1 amplified cells compared to non-amplified cells. SOX2 and OCT4 protein expression were increased by E2 treatment in FGFR1 non-amplified cells, with lesser effects in FGFR1 amplified H520 cells. SOX2 expression was also down-regulated in lung sections from mice treated with a combination of the anti-estrogen fulvestrant and the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole. Finally, we have shown that in FGFR1 non-amplified cells, the anti-proliferative effect of a pan-FGFR inhibitor, AZD4547, can be enhanced in the presence of the anti-estrogen fulvestrant. These results suggest that there is an interaction between the estrogen and FGF signaling pathways in lung cancer and provides a rationale for combination treatment of NSCLC tumors.

This agent is currently in Phase I clinical studies. Cell line derived xenografts have proven utility as models for pharmacological studies (PK/PD) and as efficacy models in cases of oncogene addiction. However, the utility of cell line xenografts is limited by the lack of molecular and cellular heterogeneity. Primary explants offer the promise of better disease models through increased diversity of molecular lesions and the presence of significant stromal cell components. Characterisation of 127 Chinese NSCLC clinical samples using FGFR1 fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis revealed an FGFR1 amplification rate of 13% (6/48) within squamous cell carcinoma. A bank of 26 primary lung explant tumour models were established and characterised - 4 of these harboured genetically amplified FGFR1 and corresponding high level protein expression. In vivo efficacy studies demonstrated rapid, potent and durable tumour regression in these models in response to oral daily dosing of AZD4547 (94-199% tumour growth inhibition after 2-3 weeks dosing of 12 or 25mg/kg AZD4547, all models p=<0.0001), correlating with pharmacodynamic modulation of FGFR signalling. Conversely, more modest anti-tumour efficacy was observed in FGFR1 non-amplified models (normal copy number and low copy gain) - (18% and 45% tumour growth inhibition after 3 weeks daily dosing of 25mg/kg AZD4547, p=0.25 and p=0.02 respectively). These data highlight the potential clinical utility of AZD4547 as a selective agent for the therapeutic treatment of squamous cell lung carcinoma harboring genetic amplification of FGFR1. 1 Weiss et al. 2010 Sci Transl Med.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) lack targeted therapeutic strategies and identification of potential oncogenic targets is imperative. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway has been implicated in mammary tumorigenesis and is a potential target in TNBC. Amplification of FGFR2 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 2), identified using genomic studies, has been reported in 4% of TNBCs. Selective FGFR inhibitors are in clinical development and patient selection for these trials is important. Preclinical data suggests that cell lines with FGFR amplification are sensitive to FGFR inhibitors. The aim of this study was to identify FGFR1 and FGFR2 amplification in TNBCs using a quantitative and sensitive methodology of digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) and compare to our results from a DNA-based microarray analysis.Methods', ' Fresh-frozen breast tumor core biopsies were collected from patients enrolled onto a TNBC neoadjuvant clinical trial. DNA from each tumor and matched germline-derived sample (n=56 pairs) was hybridized to Affymetrix Molecular Inversion Probe (MIP) array to determine copy number variation (CNV). ddPCR was used to assess amplification in FGFR1 and FGFR2 in 11 and 53 tumor/ germline DNA sample pairs respectively. The ddPCR technology utilizes TaqMan chemistry PCR primers and probes specific for FGFR1 and FGFR2. It quantitates copy number by streaming emulsion droplets single-file into a capillary that leads past a two-color detector, where the positive droplets for the target and reference genes are quantified. Copy numbers for target genes are calculated by comparing to an internal control (ultra-conserved region of chromosome 1).Results', ' CNV in FGFR1 and FGFR2 was assessed in 56 TNBCs. No FGFR1 amplifications were identified in any of the samples. FGFR2 amplifications were identified in 2/56 (4%) tumor samples. ddPCR was used to assess quantitative copy number in 53 paired tumor/ germline DNA samples for FGFR2 and 11 paired samples for FGFR1. High amplifications with 6-8 copies of FGFR2 were identified in 2/53 (4%) of the TNBCs. These two samples were the same as the ones identified to have a high copy gain by CNV analysis. No FGFR1 amplifications were identified by ddPCR and this was consistent with our CNV analysis result.Conclusions', ' Our FGFR amplification results were in congruence using two different methodologies. No FGFR1 amplification was identified in the TNBC samples assessed and FGFR2 amplification was identified in 4%. ddPCR was done on fresh-frozen TNBCs in this study but this technology can be applied to formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumors as well. ddPCR can detect multiple cancer genome amplifications and has a potential for large scale application. There are several FGFR inhibitors in clinical trials and ddPCR methodology is a clinically applicable strategy for identifying patients with FGFR amplification.']",

        "Background":"['Lucitanib (S80881, formerly E-3810) is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1-3 (VEGFR1-3) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 1-2 (FGFR1-2). It exhibits a unique pharmacological profile and demonstrates potent antitumor activity in xenograft models derived from multiple oncology indications. The on-going phase I/II clinical study of lucitanib has demonstrated objective RECIST responses in breast cancer patients with FGF-aberrant (FGFR1 and/or FGF3/4/19 gene amplified) tumors and in oncology indications anticipated to benefit from antiangiogenic agents (e.g. renal cell and thyroid cancer patients).In an attempt to further elucidate the mechanism of action of lucitanib, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo activity of lucitanib in lung cell lines with FGFR1 amplification. The FGFR1 gene is frequently amplified in lung cancer tumors and FGFR1 copy number may provide a patient selection marker for clinical trials of FGFR inhibitors. Lucitanib cytotoxic activity was evaluated and compared to other FGFR inhibitors (Dovitinib, AZD4547 and PD173074) in a panel of 11 lung cancer cell lines characterized for FGFR1/2 gene copy number and FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGF2 mRNA expression level. Lucitanib IC50 values ranged from 0.14 to 23 M; interestingly the two most sensitive cells lines (NCI-H1581 and DMS114) harbored FGFR1 amplification, while cell lines with lower FGFR1 gene copy number (2) displayed a higher drug IC50 value. In order to understand the involvement of FGFR1 inhibition in the antitumor activity of lucitanib, nude mice bearing FGFR1 amplified NCI-H1581 cell xenografts were treated with escalating doses of lucitanib (2.5, 5, 10 and 20mg/kg/day PO) continuously for 30 days. The antitumor activity of lucitanib at the dose of 2.5mg/kg was marginal (tumor volume of treated / control (T/C%) = 46), while at 5, 10 and 20mg/kg the drug was equally very active (T/C% = 24, 21 and 16, respectively). Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic assessments were undertaken at the same drug doses employed for the xenograft efficacy experiments in NCI-H1581 tumor bearing mice treated for 12 continuous days. Tumor concentrations of lucitanib, measured by LC-MS/MS, were related to the administered dose and ranged from 0.31-3.68 M and from 0.26-2.52 M at 4 and 24hrs, respectively. Lucitanib drug concentrations were higher in the tumor than in the plasma, with tumor/plasma ratios at 4 and 24 hrs of 2.00.22 and 20.56, respectively. In conclusion, these preclinical data indicate that lucitanib demonstrates in vitro efficacy in lung cancer cell lines with FGFR1 gene amplification and has a favorable drug distribution profile in tumor models.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction. Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) account for nearly 600,000 deaths worldwide annually and have limited treatment options. Approximately 20% of HNSCCs harbor amplifications of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) on chromosome 8p, however FGFR1 amplification by itself does not predict clinical response to FGFR inhibitors. We hypothesized that FGF2, or basic FGF, ligand expression is a better marker of FGFR activation and predictor of response to FGFR inhibitors.Results. A tissue micro array (TMA) of HNSCC patient biopsies was stained and quantitated for FGF2 expression by Aperio ImageScope software. FGF2 was significantly increased in recurrent tissue samples (p = 0.04). We examined a number of immortalized HNSCC cell lines and found that overexpression of both FGF2 and FGFR1 predicted response to the selective FGFR inhibitor PD173074. FGFR inhibition did not cause apoptosis, but rather induced a G0/G1 arrest and growth inhibition. FGFR inhibition also induced a change in cell morphology, with a significant increase in cell size and adherence. The expression of epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) proteins was examined and FGF2-FGFR1 activation was associated with a more mesenchymal phenotype. Accordingly, FGFR inhibition reversed invasiveness as measured using the Incucyte WoundMaker scratch assay, suggesting that HNSCCs with FGF2-FGFR1 activation have more metastatic potential. Invasiveness of these cells in vivo was confirmed using orthotopic injection into the buccal pad of NSG mice. Once primary tumors reached 0.8 cm in size, mice were sacrificed and buccal mucosa, lung, liver, and neck tissue were examined post-mortem. All of the injected animals developed local invasion, and distant metastases in the lungs. 5/7 mice also had metastases in the liver and this model is being used to test the ability of FGFR inhibition to prevent metastasis.The mechanism of autocrine FGF2-FGFR1 activation was further explored and FGF2 was found to be secreted in association with extracellular vesicles (ECVs). Interestingly, inhibition of FGFR reduced secretion of ECVs and FGF2, providing a novel approach to target autocrine and paracrine FGFR1 activation within the tumor. We further tested a number of small molecule inhibitors in combination with PD173074 to look for synergistic combinations of kinase inhibitors and found significant synergy between EGFR and FGFR inhibitors suggesting this combination may be most effective in patients with HNSCC.Conclusions. Increased FGF2 in HNSCC patient samples is correlated with recurrent disease. FGF2-FGFR1 activation increases invasiveness through activation of EMT genes both in vitro, and in an orthotopic model. Inhibition of FGF2-FGFR1 reversed the invasive phenotype in vitro and may be an effective therapeutic strategy to reduce metastases in HNSCC patients.']",

Thus it is becoming increasingly important to genotype squamous cell lung cancer as in the case of lung adenocarcinoma in which molecular profiles are incorporated into the lung cancer clinic. We conducted the Shizuoka lung cancer mutation study to analyze driver mutations in patients with thoracic malignancies and here we report the results of squamous cell lung cancer.Methods', ' Based on the biobanking system in conjunction with the clinic including the pathology lab, we have developed a multiplexed mutational panel designed to assess 23 mutations in 9 genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, MEK1, AKT1, PTEN and HER2), EGFR, MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1 and FGFR2 amplifications, and EML4-ALK translocations using pyrosequensing plus capillary electrophoresis, qRT-PCR, and RT-PCR, respectively. These results are communicated to clinicians for assigning patients to appropriate therapy and/or clinical trials.

Seven patients harbored simultaneous driver mutations (EGFR + other 5 (7%), PIK3CA amplification + other 2 (3%)). Driver mutations were more frequently detected in surgically resected snap-frozen samples than in FFPE samples (65% v.s. 32%). Tumor differentiation was not significantly correlated with the presence or absence of driver mutations.Conclusions', ' Driver mutations were detected in 47% of squamous cell lung cancer patients in this study.

Here, we describe the generation of resistant clones of the cell line NCI-H2077 to several FGFR inhibitors with clinical potential. This cell line is a squamous lung line with a focal amplification of FGFR1 that demonstrates dependency in the presence of both small molecule inhibitors and knockdown of the FGFR1 protein. After generation of resistant clones, we performed RTK phosphorylation arrays in the presence and absence of inhibitor to determine whether there were changes in the activity of other kinases, and the lines were sequenced to determine whether secondary mutations in FGFR1 had arisen. Follow-up experiments were performed to determine alternative sensitivities of the resistant clones.

The goal of this study was to discover mechanisms of resistance to ER antagonists alone and in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors. To achieve this goal, we used lentiviral vectors to individually express 559 human kinase open reading frames (ORFs) in ER+ MCF7 human breast cancer cells treated with fulvestrant ± the CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib (Novartis). In MCF7 cells treated with fulvestrant alone or with ribociclib, we identified 21 and 17 kinases, respectively, which induced a >30% increase in cell viability compared to control cells; 11 of these kinases overlapped in both treatment groups. In a secondary screen, MCF7 cells were stably transduced with V5-tagged lentiviruses expressing the positive ‘hits’ for treatment with fulvestrant/ribociclib. Five of 11 kinases (FGFR1, FRK, HCK, FGR, CRKL) were confirmed to induce resistance to fulvestrant/palbociclib and fulvestrant/ribociblib. Survey of TCGA for copy number alterations and/or expression of these five genes showed only FGFR1 to be amplified/overexpressed in 17% of ER+ breast cancers. Experiments in vitro showed that ER+/FGFR1-amplified (amp) MDA-134, CAMA-1 and HCC1500 human breast cancer cells and MCF7 cells stably transduced with FGFR1 were relatively resistant to estrogen deprivation, fulvestrant and fulvestrant/palbociclib compared to non-FGFR1 amp MCF7 cells. This resistance was abrogated by treatment with the FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) lucitanib. Treatment with fulvestrant or palbociclib, each alone, modestly delayed growth of ER+/FGFR1-amp breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX) established in nude mice. However, addition of the FGFR TKI erdafitinib to fulvestrant/palbociclib resulted in marked PDX regressions in all mice without associated toxicity. Treatment of FGFR-amp cells with FGF-2 strongly induced CCND1 (cyclin D1) expression. Downregulation of CCND1 with CCND1 RNAi oligonucleotides or kinase inhibition with erdafitinib restored sensitivity of FGFR1-amp cells to fulvestrant/palbociclib. Conversely, overexpression of CCND1 in MCF7 cells induced resistance to estrogen deprivation and fulvestrant ± palbociclib. At this time, we are examining whether FGFR1 amplification measured by FISH correlates with maintenance of proliferation (Ki67) in 110 patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer treated with palbociclib for 14 days immediately before surgery (Arnedos et al. ASCO 2016). In summary, using a gain-of-function ORF kinome screen, we identified FGFR1 amplification as a mechanism of resistance to anti-ER therapies ± CDK4/6 inhibitors.

Furthermore, the FGFR2 protein expression significantly correlated with Ki-67 proliferation index (P < 0.0001, r = 0.4677). In FISH analysis, FGFR1 gene amplification was detected in 34.3% (12/35) of SqCCs, and FGFR2 gene amplification was detected in 22.9% (8/35) of SqCCs. Furthermore, the Ki-67 proliferation index was significantly higher in SqCCs with FGFR2 gene amplification than in SqCCs without FGFR2 gene amplification (P = 0.0069). Conclusions', ' FGFR2 gene amplification and overexpression frequently occur and correlate with the tumor proliferation in SqCCs of the lung.

        "Background":"['The fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1, FGR2, FRG3, FGR4) are frequently altered or overexpressed in both lung and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Amplification of FGFR1 has been reported to be as high as 22% in lung SCC and 17% in head and neck SCC (HNSCC). FGFRs have been identified as a potential therapeutic target in lung and head and neck cancers. In addition, FGFRs activate multiple pathways involved in the radiation response including RAS/RAF/MAPK, PI3K/AKT and STAT. AZD4547 is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the FGFR family and is currently being investigated in clinical trials. Since a substantial portion of lung cancer and HNSCC patients are treated with radiotherapy, we examined the anti-tumor effects of AZD4547 in combination with radiation in both lung and head and neck cancer model systems. FGFR protein and RNA expression and cell proliferation with AZD4547 were evaluated in 8 lung and 8 head and neck cancer cell lines. Clonogenic survival assays were performed on 4 lung and 4 head and neck cancer cell lines and xenograft experiments were performed on one HNSCC cell line. These cell lines demonstrated varying levels of FGFR1, 2 and 3 protein and RNA expression. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of AZD4547 in these cell lines ranged from 0.05 to 128 uM. Sensitivity to AZD4547 did not correlate directly with protein or RNA expression. In vitro clonogenic survival assays showed limited effects of combining AZD4547 with radiation. However, significant tumor growth delay was observed with the combination of radiation and AZD4547 compared to radiation or drug alone in the SCC1483 FGFR2 expressing HNSCC xenograft model. These findings suggest that AZD4547 can augment the response of radiation in an in vivo model system.

        "Background":"['Lung cancer accounts for the highest number of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Patient outcome is dismal and approval of targeted compounds is yet restricted to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) histology. In defined subgroups of NSCLC, but also of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), genetically amplified fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) is an oncogenic driver and inhibition of the FGFR1 signaling axis exerts potent antitumor effects. The FGFR/PDGFR/VEGFR inhibitor (TKI) nintedanib has recently been approved for second-line treatment of lung adenocarcinoma (AC) and is also being investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of SCLC. Despite initial treatment success, tumor recurrence due to acquired drug resistance is anticipated. We therefore aimed at characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance development of FGFR1-driven lung cancer against nintedanib.One SCLC line (DMS114) and two NSCLC squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lines (NCI-H1703, NCI-H520) driven by FGFR1 based on gene amplification were selected for nintedanib resistance in vitro. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT and FACS. Intracellular responses to drug exposure were analyzed by qPCR and Western Blot. To compare transcription levels of parental cells with their selected sublines, whole-genome gene expression array was performed. Cross-cytotoxicity profiles were determined by a large-scale anticancer compound screen. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter activity was analyzed by calcein AM efflux- and ATPase assay, intracellular Nintedanib levels were determined by liquid chromatograpy-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).Chronic exposure to the FGFR/PDGFR/VEGFR inhibitor nintedanib led to expression of the ABCB1 multidrug-resistance (MDR) efflux pump in the SCLC cell line DMS114 but not in the NSCLC SCC cell lines NCI-H1703 and NCI-H520. In the nintedanib-selected subline of DMS114 (DMS114/NIN), the FGFR1 signaling axis remained active. Insensitivity of DMS1114/NIN towards Nintedanib was mediated by efflux via ABCB1, revealing Nintedanib as a substrate for this efflux pump. Ponatinib, another non-ABCB1-substrate FGFR inhibitor, retained strong cytotoxic activity. Additionally, DMS114/NIN cells exerted profound and ABCB1-dependent collateral sensitivity against the MDR-selective lanthanum compound KP772.ABCB1 needs to be considered as a factor underlying intrinsic and acquired nintedanib resistance. On one hand, in second-line therapy, chemotherapy-induced MDR might render tumors resistant to Nintedanib. On the other hand, in first-line treatment, high ABCB1 expression in cancer cells or the microvasculature e.g. in clear-cell renal carcinoma or CNS tumors might account for intrinsic Nintedanib resistance. Switching to MDR-selective anticancer compounds or to non-ABCB1-substrate small molecule TKIs in FGFR/PDGFR/VEGFR-driven tumors might be an option to circumvent nintedanib resistance.']",

Methods', '    This was a multicentre Phase 1 expansion of AZD4547 in patients with previously treated stage IV FGFR1 amplified SQCLCs (NCT00979134).  FGFR1 amplification (FGFR1', 'CEP8 2) was confirmed through central FISH (N=13) or review of local results (N=2). Primary endpoint was safety/tolerability.

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Ponatinib was designed as a highly potent inhibitor of native BCR-ABL as well as the T315I gatekeeper mutant that is resistant to all approved therapies, and has demonstrated substantial activity in patients with native or mutant BCR-ABL in a phase 1 trial. Activity against T315I is due to a key design feature, the triple bond linker, which enforces ligand linearity in this sterically demanding region of the binding site. Ponatinib also inhibits the in vitro kinase activity of a number of other clinically relevant kinases (FLT3, RET, KIT, PDGFR, PDGFR, and FGFR1; IC50s of 0.2 to 13 nM), many of which have developed resistance to existing therapies via mutation of the gatekeeper residue. Here we assessed whether ponatinib might represent a more general solution to gatekeeper mutant inhibition of these and other clinically important kinases by virtue of its design features. Results', ' The cellular activity of ponatinib was assessed using Ba/F3 cells transformed to IL-3 independence by expression of an activated kinase (via fusion to a TEL dimerization domain). Ponatinib potently inhibited viability of cells expressing activated FLT3, RET, KIT, PDGFR, PDGFR and FGFR1 with IC50s of 15, 8, 7, 1, 2 and 21 nM, respectively. In contrast, ponatinib did not affect viability of parental Ba/F3 cells grown in the presence of IL-3 (IC50 >1000 nM). Kinase variants in which the gatekeeper residue was mutated to isoleucine, leucine or methionine (all by a single nucleotide change from the native sequence) were then transformed into Ba/F3 cells. All of these variants have been shown previously, or in our studies, to confer substantial resistance (i.e. >50-fold) to other targeted agents. Ponatinib maintained substantial activity against all variants tested. The smallest potency reduction (2- to 9-fold) was seen in variants mutated to isoleucine, with FLT3F691I, KITT670I, PDGFRT674I, and PDGFRT681I being inhibited with IC50s of 62, 26, 2 and 17 nM, respectively. A slightly greater potency reduction (10- to 22-fold) was seen in sterically more demanding leucine or methionine mutations, with RETV804M, RETV804L and FGFR1V561M being inhibited with IC50s of 84, 178 and 202 nM, respectively. In all cell lines, cell viability effects were accompanied by inhibition of receptor phosphorylation. Conclusion', ' Ponatinib is a potent inhibitor of activated variants of FLT3, RET, KIT, PDGFR, PDGFR, and FGFR1, in addition to BCR-ABL. Ponatinib also maintains substantial activity against gatekeeper variants shown to mediate resistance to other targeted agents, inhibiting their activity with IC50s that are within range of known clinically achievable plasma concentrations. These results suggest that ponatinib may offer a more general solution to gatekeeper mutant inhibition and support clinical testing in a variety of cancers driven by activated kinases.']",

Methods', '  FGFR and FGF gene expression in formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples was performed using a sensitive quantitative nuclease protection assay. This gene expression panel includes all four FGFRs, all 22 FGF ligands and known FGF interacting proteins KLOTHO and KLOTHO beta. Using this array we profiled 100 NSCLC samples (45 squamous, 55 non-squamous).  Results', '  Gene expression analysis of the FGFR family in lung cancer showed overexpression by 3X over median levels of FGFR2 and FGFR3 predominantly in squamous subtype (28% and 19% respectively), FGFR4 overexpresion mainly in non-squamous subtype (25%) and FGFR1 overexpression evenly distributed between squamous and non-squamous subtypes (9 %). There were rare instances of joint overexpression of more than one FGFR, FGFR 1 and 2  together (6%), FGFR 1 and 3 together (2%) and FGFR 3 and 4 together (2%). Overexpression of FGFs was seen in ~35% of all NSCLC samples with FGF19 overexpression being the most common, with increases seen in 20 % of all NSCLC samples.  Conclusions', '   We report for the first time a sensitive and comprehensive FGF and FGFR gene expression analysis of 100 lung cancers. Our expression profiling did not confirm frequent overexpression of FGFR1 in squamous NSCLC in contradiction to frequent gene amplification at this locus suggesting that DNA amplification may not result in transcriptional alteration in many cases. Additionally, we detected frequent overexpression of FGFR2 and 3 in squamous NSCLC and FGFR4 overexpression in adenocarcinoma subtype of NSCLC. The receptor overexpression is frequently associated with overexpression of FGF ligands suggesting a paracrine effect.

        "Background":"['The estrogen receptor (ER) promotes cell proliferation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Since fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are known regulators of stem cell markers in ER positive breast cancer, we investigated whether a link between the estrogen pathway, FGFs, and stem cell markers could be demonstrated in NSCLC animal models, human cells lines and tumor tissue. In the lungs of female FVB/N mice exposed to the tobacco carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosoamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, NNK, treatment with the anti-estrogen fulvestrant and/or the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole blocked secretion of both FGF2 and FGF9, and reduced expression of the stem cell markers SOX2 and nanog. These effects were observed in the normal airway epilthelium as well as in both lung preneoplasias and lung adenomas. To investigate the effects of β-estradiol (E2), male mice were administered E2 in the drinking water during exposure to NNK for 4 weeks. In this mouse model, the incidence of carcinogen-induced lung preneoplasias increased 1.8-fold (p<0.05) with E2 exposure accompanied by increased expression of FGF2, FGF9, SOX2, and nanog in airway preneoplasias demonstrating a relationship between activation of the FGF pathway in the lungs, expansion of cells with a stem cell phenotype, and promotion of pre-cancerous changes. In FGFR1 normal copy number NSCLC cell lines that express multiple FGFR family members and secrete several FGFs, E2 treatment caused a significant increase (up to 4-fold; p<0.05) in release of FGF2, an effect that was completely blocked by fulvestrant. Treatment with fulvestrant also resulted in a 30% reduction in phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2, the FGFR docking protein. Upon co-inhibition of ER and FGFRs using fulvestrant and the pan-FGFR inhibitor AZD4547, significantly enhanced (p<0.01) anti-proliferative effects were observed in FGFR1 normal copy number NSCLC cells that show low sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors as single agents. In NSCLC xenografts, the combination of AZD4547 (daily 12.5 mg/kg) and fulvestrant (30 mg/kg twice weekly) resulted in a significantly greater inhibition (67-85% decrease; p<0.05) of tumor growth and decreased expression of Ki67 and stem cell markers compared to each single agent treatment. Furthermore, tumor histology appeared more differentiated and up to a 25% decrease in malignant cellularity was observed with combination treatment compared to each single agent treatment. In NSCLC patient tumors, high ERΒ expression correlated with high FGFR1 expression (p<0.001). Taken together, these results suggest that interaction between the ER and FGFR pathways in NSCLC promotes a stem-like state. Combining an FGFR inhibitor with an ER pathway inhibitor could be exploited to increase the efficacy of FGFR inhibitors for NSCLC patients who lack FGFR genetic alterations.

A written informed consent was obtained upfront from all patients enrolled into this study.

EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) was administered to 71.9% (41/57) of previously untreated patients who harbor EGFR activating mutations. Among those treated with EGFR-TKIs, simultaneous mutations in other genes with EGFR mutations were detected in 21.9% (9/41). Response rate of EGFR-TKIs in patients with simultaneous mutations (44.4%) was lower than that in patients with EGFR mutation alone (68.8%), suggesting that additional mutations may play some role in evading oncogenic signaling blockade. EGFR mutations were detected less frequently in smokers than in never-smokers (25.1% vs 60.5%, p<0.0001). Meanwhile, KRAS mutations were detected more frequently in smokers than in never-smokers (13.6% vs 2.5%, p=0.0043), which is consistent with previous reports. The majority of patients with never-smoking history harbored targetable somatic mutations compared to those with smoking history (71.6% vs 45.2%, p<0.0001).Conclusions', ' We have established the multiplexed tumor genotyping panel and this should be incorporated into lung cancer clinical practice to facilitate personalized cancer medicine.']",

Unlike lung adenocarcinoma, few targetable genomic events are known drivers of lung SCC, and therefore, therapeutic options are limited for patients with this disease. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, we have analyzed the entire coding sequence of 196 lung SCCs for mutated genes which may be amenable to targeted therapeutics. In the 108 patient samples analyzed to date, we have observed mutations in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) kinase gene in six cases at four sites, or 3% of samples. The observed FGFR3 mutations are present in both the extracellular domain and the kinase domain of the protein, an observation that is consistent with activating mutations in FGFR3 that are known to drive bladder cancer, and in fact, two of the observed mutations are at sites previously observed in bladder cancer. We therefore hypothesized that these mutations are oncogenic and may be driving transformation in a subset of lung SCC patients. Expression of mutated FGFR3 in NIH-3T3 cells led to anchorage-independent colony formation, which was inhibited by treatment with a pan-FGFR inhibitor. A known mechanism of FGFR3 activation is the constitutive dimerization of receptors with mutated extracellular domains via intermolecular disulfide bond formation, and we have observed this phenomenon in our ECD mutants as well. These data suggest that mutations in the FGFR3 gene are sufficient to transform cells. This finding, along with recently published data suggesting that FGFR1 amplification is also able to drive lung SCC development, demonstrates that the FGFR family may be a promising therapeutic target in lung SCC.']",

FGFs and FGFRs are reported to be related to drug resistance, cell proliferation, differentiation and motility. Among various FGFs, FGF9 is a developmentally important FGF associated with epithelial airway branching, and its expression is repressed in normal adult lungs. We have previously shown that FGF9 is highly expressed in NSCLC cells, and FGF9 expression was associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. Furthermore, we reported that induction of FGF9 in adult lung results in the rapid formation of adenocarcinoma in specific gene engineered mouse model. However, the exact roles of FGF9 in lung epithelial cells remain elusive.Objectives', ' The objective of this study is to clarify the roles of FGF9 in lung epithelial cells.Methods', ' For in vitro experiments, a stable cell line with constitutive expression of FGF9 in MLE12 (a mouse lung alveolar type II cell line transformed by SV40 large T antigen) was established by retroviral infection. The effect of FGF9 on proliferation, colony formation capacity and downstream signaling was evaluated by MTS assay, softagar colony formation assay and Western blotting, respectively. For in vivo experiments, the cells were transplanted into immunodeficient mice subcutaneously, and the size of tumor was measured. To evaluate the efficacy of FGFR inhibitors for FGF9-driven lung cancers, AZD4547, selective FGFR inhibitor, was orally administered. For pathological characterization of the tumors, immunohistochemical staining was performed.Fifteen surgically-resected SCLC samples were obtained and the expression of FGF9 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.Results', ' FGF9 has oncogenic ability in vitro and its effect may be exerted by the activation of MAPK pathway through FGFR1 and FGFR3 in MLE12 cells. Unexpectedly, pathological analysis revealed FGF9-driven tumors exhibited SCLC histology. Selective FGFR inhibitor, AZD4547 suppressed tumor growth of FGF9-driven MLE12 tumors. FGF9 is highly expressed in human SCLC samples (67%).Conclusions', ' These results suggest that FGF9 has roles of tumor initiation and progression in lung cancer, especially in SCLC.SCLC which highly expresses FGF9 may be a target of FGFR inhibitors.']",

Based on the different responses to treatment, lung cancer is divided into two major classes', ' small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Adenocarcinoma (AdC) and squamous cell lung cancer (SqCC) are two major sub-types of NSCLC. We have successfully developed a novel lentiviral gene delivery system to study the initiation and development of all these lung cancers. We used CA2Cre-shp53 lentiviral vector to initiate lung adenocarcinoma in LSL-KrasG12D mice and proved the importance of NF-B/IKK2 pathway in tumor cell proliferation. To search for novel tumor suppressors in lung cancer, we incorporated an shRNA library targeting 5000 cell signal genes into our CA2Cre lentivector and did the screening in the mice. We have identified several dozens of candidates and are validating these genes back in animals. SCLC is the most malignant form of lung cancer with a five-year survival less than 6%. A mouse model with p53/Rb deletions activated by Adeno-Cre has been established in Berns lab. To improve the model and study other genes that are frequently mutated in human SCLC, we designed a single lentiviral vector to deliver oncogenes (L-myc etc.) and shRNAs against tumor suppressors (p53, Rb etc) and successfully initiated SCLC in wild-type mice. Furthermore, we included luciferase or fluorescence protein genes in the same vector to follow tumor growth and metastasis in the live animal. Using this new model, we are now studying the crosstalk of multiple mutations in the SCLC development. SqCC has not been well modeled by genetic approaches. Interestingly, when we gave KrasG12D-shp53 lentiviral vector after lung tissue damage induced by naphthalene, the mice quickly developed squamous tumors in the big bronchi other than adenocarcinomas in the peripheral lung. Kras mutations are actually not common in human SqCC patients, so we are now optimizing the model and see if more relevant genetic changes such FGFR1 amplification can also induce this type of lung cancer in mice. We hope that our unique lentiviral tool can simplify and accelerate the lung cancer study to understand the big signal pathway complex leading to tumorigenesis and metastasis in the lung and search for new therapies for this deadly human disease.']",

Nanostring analysis of additional genes on the 8p12 region, revealed that several of these, for example PPAPDC1B, ASH2L, TACC1 and in particular the FGFR1 neighbouring gene WHSC1L1 are highly expressed in FGFR1 amplified tumors (p<0.0001 for WHSC1L1). In contrast, expression of LETM2, located between WHSCL1 and FGFR1, was not significantly increased in amplified tumors.An FGF ligand expression profile was generated for each tumor, showing that a-FGF, b-FGF and FGF7 were the most abundantly expressed ligands in the sqNSCLC samples, with increased b-FGF expression detected in high FGFR1 expressing tumours. The expression of a panel of potential mediators of resistance to FGFR inhibitor therapy such as c-MET, EGFR and IGF1R were also profiled across the samples, revealing differential expression of these factors across each of the tumors and an inverse correlation between FGFR1 expression and ERBB3 expression.Taken together, these data validate the utility of the Nanostring platform for expression analysis of FGFR pathway genes using mRNA isolated from FFPE tumor samples and this platform can be used to assess the level of expression of potential modulators of clinical outcome.']",

Most of the pts (84.6%, 66/78) were stage IV at their first diagnosis and the median age was 57 year-old. There were significantly more male pts with a history of smoking than females (90% vs. 5.3%; P<0.001). Median survival time of the whole cohort was 14.1 months.

In spite of many studies over the last few years to elucidate this mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs, approximately 30% of the mechanisms of acquired resistance are still unknown. Recently autocrine signaling of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) has been demonstrated in NSCLC cell lines. And several studies suggest that the FGF-FGFR autocrine growth pathway could be an important mechanism for intrinsic resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cell lines with wild-type EGFR. But until now, no report has clarified the role of FGF-FGFR pathway in acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cell lines with sensitive EGFR mutations. We have established a gefitinib-resistant cell line (PC9 GR), by serial exposure of gefitinib to PC9, an originally gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer cell line (PC9 na). We confirmed that these cell lines did not harbor two well-known EGFR-TKI resistance mechanisms, the second mutation in the EGFR gene itself, EGFR T790 and the amplification of the MET oncogene. We collected total RNA from both PC9 na and PC9 GR and examined mRNA expression profile, by using cDNA microarray analysis. We found the expressions of FGFR1 and FGF2 were increased in PC9 GR compared to in PC9 na. The growth of PC9 GR cells was inhibited either by PD173074 (inhibitors of FGFRs) or knocking down of FGFR1 or FGF2 by siRNA in combination with gefitinib. FACS analysis revealed that the combination treatment with PD173074 and gefitinib induced apoptosis more efficiently in PC9 GR cells compared to gefitinib alone. PC9 na cells and PC9 GR cells did not show any change in the proportion of apoptotic cells after treatment with PD173074 alone. To further investigate how FGF2-FGFR1 pathway affects resistance to gefitinib in these cell lines, the downstream targets of EGFR signaling including the MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways were examined. In PC9 na cells, the phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK, and AKT was efficiently inhibited by gefitinib alone. On the other hand, in PC9 GR cells, the phosphorylation of ERK and AKT was not efficiently inhibited by gefitinib alone. However, the inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK was completely and AKT was less efficiently rescued by gefitinib and PD173074 combination therapy. In conclusion, these data suggest the activation of FGF2-FGFR1 signaling pathway contributes to the gefitinib resistance in PC9 GR. FGF2-FGFR1 pathway will be a therapeutic target for a subset of NSCLC that acquires EGFR-TKI resistance.']",

Additionally, achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1), a transcription factor for development of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, is a lineage-dependent oncogene for SCLC. New drugs and molecular targets need to be identified. Previously, we reported nelfinavir (NFV), a HIV protease inhibitor, inhibited proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in vitro and human NSCLC xenograft tumors through induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Here we demonstrate that the effect of NFV in SCLC cells and preclinical treatment studies using SCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. NFV inhibited SCLC cell proliferation and induced cell death in vitro. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a marker of the UPR, was rapidly increased, whereas Myc was decreased after 4 hr treatment with NFV. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which plays a role in cellular energy homeostasis, was activated in the early phase of NFV treatment, whereas the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) that is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates cell growth, was inactivated. NFV inhibited the expression of SOX2, ASCL1 and Aurora B in a cell line- and time-dependent manner. Taken together, NFV had pleiotropic effects against multiple targets during the inhibition of SCLC cell proliferation. In vivo, NFV inhibited growth of SCLC PDX tumors, which correlated with induction of the UPR and decreased expression of ASCL1 and Aurora B.

Anti-tumor efficacy was largely independent of the tumor type surveyed or the FGFR isoform being overexpressed. Preclinical models included a patient-derived squamous head and neck cancer (HNSCC) xenograft (PDx) model overexpressing FGFR3 mRNA, a bladder cancer PDx model overexpressing FGFR2 mRNA, and a squamous esophageal cancer PDx model overexpressing FGFR1 mRNA. Against this background, clinical proof-of-concept was assessed by enrolling patients into the stratified expansion cohort of a Phase 1 study of BAY 1163877 (NCT01976741) based on tumor FGFR1-3 mRNA levels. FGFR1-3 mRNA was quantified in archival or newly obtained FFPE tumor biopsies by RNA in situ hybridization (RNAscope, ACD) and digital transcript counting (NanoString). In total, biopsies from > 500 patients were studied for FGFR1-3 mRNA expression levels. Based on preclinical xenograft experiments showing that low to moderate FGFR1-3 mRNA overexpression was not sufficient for a robust drug response, only patients with an RNAscope score of 3 or 4 (range 0-4) or a normalized Nanostring signal of 800 counts were eligible for enrollment. By applying these stringent criteria, FGFR1-3 mRNA positivity was on average observed with a 2- to 3-fold higher prevalence than published data for genetic aberrations of FGFRs in the respective tumor types (including amplifications, translocations, mutations). We further identified FGFR mRNA(+) tumor types in which genetic FGFR aberrations have not been previously reported. FGFR1-3 mRNA positivity ranged from 10% in lung adenocarcinoma to 45% in squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC) and 54% in HNSCC. As of August 2016, 57 FGFR mRNA(+) patients were enrolled and treated with BAY 1163877. Six patients experienced a partial remission (PR) by RECIST v1.1 criteria; including an FGFR3 mRNA(+) HNSCC patient without FGFR3 amplification or translocation, an FGFR1 mRNA(+) adenoid cystic carcinoma patient, and an FGFR1 mRNA(+) sqNSCLC patient (both without FGFR1 gene amplification), as well as an FGFR3 mRNA(+) bladder cancer patient without FGFR3 amplification, mutation or translocation. These results suggest that high FGFR1-3 mRNA expression identifies patients sensitive to FGFR inhibition.

This is exemplified by the disappointing results in the recent Phase III evaluation of ornatuzumab in combination with erlotinib in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NCT01456324), targeting both MET and EGFR in biomarker-defined patient populations. We have previously shown that proximity ligation assay (PLA) technology can be harnessed to evaluate EGFR pathway activation by annotating the presence of EGFR in complex with its major signaling adaptor GRB2. Presence of these signaling-associated complexes correlates with EGFR activity, reveals erlotinib pharmacodynamics and associates with improved outcomes to EGFR-directed therapies. Here, we show that PLA technology can also be harnessed to assess MET signaling activity in lung cancer. We have found that MET is constitutively associated with GRB2 in MET-amplified lung cancer cell lines and this interaction is abrogated by the MET-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor PHA665,752 (MET TKI) as measured by biochemical approaches and PLA. In parallel experiments, siRNA-mediated knockdown of GRB2 and 100nM MET TKI both lead to dramatic reductions in cell viability, indicating that this interaction is critical in MET-driven cells. Conversely, GRB2 knockdown has no effect in MET-amplified H1648 cells which are also completely resistant to MET TKI. In MET-amplified patient-derived xenograft models of lung cancer we observe MET', 'GRB2 complexes in regions that also stain strongly using pMET(Y1234/5) immunohistochemistry (IHC).

We are currently conducting mass spectrometry experiments to decipher differences between MET complexes in the amplified vs. ligand-stimulating setting and updated results will be presented. We suggest that only a subset of high MET-expressing cells has evidence of MET in complex with GRB2, potentially explaining the relatively low response rates observed with MET-directed therapies in lung cancer.

The genes studied included ERBB2, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, SRC, JAK3, ERBB4, ERBB2, and SMAD4. In addition, these tumors were studied for the expression of PD-L1 using immunohistochemistry (IHC). PD-L1 expression was performed using standard IHC approach using SP142 clone (Spring Biosciences). Results', ' The level of PD-L1 expression was significantly (P = 0.0005) lower in colorectal cancer as compared with NSCLC. The NSCLC cohort had significantly (P = < 0.0001) more cases with 3 or more genes mutated as compared with colorectal cancer. However, there was no significant difference in TP53 mutation frequency between the two tumor types. There was no correlation between PD-L1 expression and the presence or absence of 3 or more gene mutations in either NSCLC or colorectal cancer. However, PD-L1 expression was significantly (P = 0.01) higher in tumors with TP53 mutation in the NSCLC cohort, but not in the colorectal carcinoma cohort (P = 0.5). This was true whether PD-L1 level was used as a continuous variable or if it was dichotomized at 20% (P = 0.02) or 40% (P = 0.03) cutoffs. Conclusions', ' There is significant difference between NSCLC and colorectal cancers in PD-L1 expression levels. More importantly, TP53 mutation in NSCLC correlates with the expression of PD-L1 protein, but not in colorectal cancer despite similar rate of mutation of the TP53 between the two tumor types. This suggests a possible difference in the mechanism of regulating PD-L1 expression between the two tumor types.']",

FGF ligand-dependent signaling plays an important role in cancer development and growth through autocrine production of FGFs from cancer cells, or paracrine production of FGFs from local stroma, or by tumor overexpression of FGF receptors (FGFRs) or amplification of FGFR genes. FGFR1 amplification has been identified in ~15-20% of squamous non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and is associated with shorter disease-free and overall survival. Efficacy was observed with GSK230 + chemotherapy in FGFR1 amplified in NSCLC xenograft models and in xenograft models of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) where FGF2 mRNA levels were overexpressed. In a phase I study, no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was identified and 20 mg/kg weekly was the maximum feasible dose (MFD) achieving the desired target concentration. Toxicities associated with small-molecule FGFR inhibition, namely hyperphosphatemia and retinal, nail, and skin changes, were not observed.

Different from non-small cell lung cancer, SCLC is characterized by a high proliferation rate and early metastasis. Only about 25% of patients with limited stage disease will be cured after first-line standard treatment and majority of the patients will relapse after initial sensitivity to the chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The highly complex genetic landscape of SCLC may be the reason for its resistance to conventional therapy but the details are still unclear. Methods', ' Nine patients with SCLC received platinum-based chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were included in this study. According to the prognosis, patients were classified into two groups', ' poor prognosis group (PP group, PFS < 6 months, n = 5) and better prognosis group (BP group, PFS > 24 months, n = 4).

Followed by next generation sequencing on an Illumina X10 platform, the captured sequencing data was further processed using bioinformatics analysis to identify somatic mutations, including single nucleotide variants (SNV), short insertions/deletions (indels) and copy number variation (CNV). Changes in tumor DNA were compared with clinical efficiency. Results', ' We show that the tumor mutation burden in PP group is higher than the BP group (p = 0.06).

        "Background":"['One recurrent alteration of squamous cell lung cancer is the amplified region of the 8p12-p11 locus. The tyrosine kinase fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) seems to be one of the most prominent targets of this amplification. Thus, small molecules inhibiting FGFRs have been employed to treat FGFR1-amplified squamous cell lung cancer. However, only about 16% of such FGFR1-amplified tumors respond to single agent inhibitor therapy. Several tumors exhibited insufficient tumor shrinkage, compatible with the existence of persistence of inhibitor-resistant tumor cells in the tumor. To investigate the mechanism of FGFR-inhibitor persistence we studied the lung cancer cell lines DMS114 and H1581. Both cell lines demonstrate GI50 values in the nanomolar range upon three different FGFR-inhibitors. However, both cell lines exhibit sustained cell viability within 0.5 to 5 M inhibitor treatment, indicating a subpopulation of persistent cells. We therefore isolated these persistent cells by treating with a high dose of FGFR inhibitors. After 8 to 12 weeks the cells were completely resistant against all FGFR inhibitors tested. Genetic identity with the original cell line was confirmed by fingerprinting. We found that while parental cell lines showed depleted pERK signals, persistent cells were marked by a constant pERK level upon treatment. In H1581 cells, reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway was demonstrated by an active RAS-pulldown assay. Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed high and focal NRAS amplification and DUSP6 depletion, leading to MAPK-pathway reactivation. Furthermore, retroviral overexpression of wild type RAS-isoforms induced FGFR-inhibitor resistance in parental H1581 cells. In DMS114 we observed MET and IGF-1R activation as possible mechanisms of persistence. Furthermore, co-inhibition of FGFR and MEK was a highly effective combination therapy to treat FGFR-inhibitor persistent cells. This study associates the MAPK-pathway as a key pathway for FGFR-dependent cell lines. Furthermore, these results suggest a beneficial FGFR / MEK combination treatment to avoid the outgrowth of FGFR-inhibitor persistent cells.']",

A broad array of mutations have been observed that likely activate through different mechanisms, given the disparate functions of the domains they are found in', ' the ligand binding (LB) domain, the extracellular (EC) domain that effects receptor dimerization, the transmembrane (TM) domain, and the kinase domain (KD). FGFR2 is mutated in 10% of endometrial cancers, with 90% of all mutations found at six specific codons. In addition, mutations have been found in 12% of lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs; FGFR1-4), 50% of bladder cancers (FGFR3), and in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; FGFR1). Ponatinib (AP24534) is an oral multi-targeted kinase inhibitor being developed for the treatment of CML or Ph+ ALL. Previously, ponatinib was shown to also be a potent inhibitor of all 4 FGFRs, inhibiting viability of Ba/F3 cells dependent on activated variants of native FGFR1-4 (via fusion to a TEL dimerization domain) with IC50s of 14-47 nM. Similar potency was observed in HEK cells transiently transfected to overexpress full-length FGFR1-3, as measured by inhibition of FGFR phosphorylation (IC50s 15-35 nM). Here, the HEK cell system was used to test the ability of ponatinib to inhibit a broad panel of naturally-occurring mutant variants of FGFR1-3, with a primary focus on mutant variants of FGFR2 that have been observed in endometrial and/or SCCs.Results', ' Of 12 FGFR2 mutants tested, ponatinib inhibited the activity of 10 with high potency and 2 with moderate potency.

With attention to the direct connection between the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of tumor cells and the pharmacological effects of specific inhibitors, we systematically assessed the RTK expressions of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung (HGNEC), including SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC).Patients and Methods', 'Fifty-one LCNEC and 61 SCLC patients who underwent surgical resection were enrolled in this research. As a control group, 202 patients with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 122 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs) were also analyzed. Using immunohistochemical staining (IHC), we stained all tumors with antibodies for 10 RTKs; c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET and ROS1. We scored the expression of these RTKs for all enrolled tumors, and compared them according to the histological types.Results', 'The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. Especially, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20% of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.Conclusions', 'Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs. The exclusive c-Kit positivity observed among HGNECs suggested that c-Kit might be a distinctive RTK in HGNEC. These HGNECs which have strongly positive RTKs could be the targets of personalized therapies.']",

        "Background":"['Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a malignant neuroendocrine tumor of the lung accounting for 15% of all lung cancer cases. SCLC is a highly aggressive disease characterized by early metastasis and a high mortality rate of 95%. The standard of care is chemotherapy, which remains largely ineffective due to quick relapse of chemo-resistant tumors. To date, targeted therapies have not been identified for the treatment of SCLC.In order to comprehensively characterize the genomic alterations in this cancer type, we sought for a worldwide collaboration to collect rare surgical specimen of SCLC patients. Thus, we were able to study copy number alterations in 130 cases, and performed whole genome sequencing on over 78 tumor-normal pairs and transcriptome sequencing of at least 62 primary tumors and 16 SCLC cell lines. In a complementary approach we analyzed tumors derived from a murine SCLC model that was established by the conditional inactivation of Rb1 and Trp53 in lung epithelial cells (Meuwissen et al., 2003). We collected copy number alteration data for 20 mouse SCLC cases and performed exome and genome sequencing of at least 8 tumors derived from SCLC mice which additionally harbored a conditional knockout of Rbl2 (Schaffer et al., 2010).Human SCLC tumors comprise large areas of copy number alterations, revealing focal amplifications of MYC transcription factors. In line with this finding recurrent MYCL1 amplifications were also detected in murine SCLC. Human primary tumors were additionally found to harbor focal homozygous deletions of the CDKN2A locus. Furthermore, low frequent amplifications of oncogenes were identified among which therapeutic tractable FGFR1 amplifications were observed in approximately 6% of the cases.The genomic data allowed for the comprehensive characterization of the TP53 and RB1 locus at higher resolution, aiding in the identification of mutations, hemizygous and homozygous deletions, and larger genomic rearrangements. Consequently, lesions of TP53 and RB1 were found to affect both alleles in almost 100% of the cases analyzed. Other TP53 and RB1 family members were also altered in human tumor specimen thus supporting the mouse models for SCLC. In line with previous findings PTEN inactivation was found in 14% of the cases. Furthermore, recurrent mutations were detected in neuroendocrine specific genes and in chromatin and histone modifiers, among which the inactivation of the histone-acyl-transferases CREBBP and EP300 occurred at a frequency of 24%.In summary, as a continuation of our initial pilot study on 29 SCLC exomes (Peifer et al., 2012) this comprehensive large scale genomic analysis provides further insight into the complex genomic architecture of SCLC tumors and substantially improves the resolution to detect genomic alterations. This larger SCLC tumor cohort allows for the identification of low frequent alterations that might play a decisive role in the development and progression of this disease.']",

Upon ligand binding, FGFRs activate an array of downstream signaling pathways, such as the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways. Genetic abnormalities (gene fusion, mutation and amplification) of FGFRs are known to cause constitutive activation of their signaling pathways, which play an important role in proliferation, survival and migration of cancer cells, tumor angiogenesis, drug resistance, etc. These abnormalities have also been reported to be involved in different cancer types including lung, breast, endometrial, gastric, and bladder cancer so far. Therefore, FGFRs are considered as one of potential targets for cancer therapy.E7090 is an orally available, selective and potent inhibitor of FGFR1, 2 and 3 tyrosine kinase activities.E7090 displayed inhibition of FGFR1, 2, and 3 kinase activities with the IC50 values of approximately 1 nmol/L. E7090 also inhibited the growth of SNU-16, human gastric cancer cell line harboring FGFR2 amplification with an IC50 value of 3 nmol/L. This activity was about 60-fold stronger than that against VEGF-stimulated HUVEC growth. Kinase profiling assay consisting of 93 kinases including non-receptor and serine/threonine kinases, also demonstrated that E7090 inhibited limited kinases including FGFR-1, -2 and -3. In addition, E7090 inhibited proliferation of human cancer cell lines harboring various types of FGFRs gene abnormalities such as amplification, mutation, or translocation in vitro, which are confirmed by the inhibition of FGFR signaling. E7090 also showed significant antitumor activities on various human xenografts harboring FGFRs gene abnormalities in a dose dependent manner and demonstrated tumor shrinkage at several doses in some models. Furthermore, pharmacodynamics analysis revealed that E7090 inhibited phosphorylation of FGFRs in SNU-16 xenograft tumors in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, the in vitro and in vivo studies confirm that E7090 is a potent and selective FGFRs inhibitor, showing promising antitumor activities with wider therapeutic windows in preclinical cancer models harboring FGFRs gene abnormalities.

The low 5-year survival rate of the highly aggressive LNETs (SCLC and LCNEC) combined with the lack of an effective treatment, suggest that understanding how these tumors arise and identifying therapeutic targets are unmet needs. We performed genome/exome, and transcriptome sequencing of 29 SCLC (Ref.1), 60 LCNEC, and 45 PCA to better understand their molecular origin and identify altered genes that may offer therapeutic opportunities.In contrast to SCLC and LCNEC, we found that RB1 and TP53 mutations were rare events in PCA suggesting that PCA are not early progenitor lesions of SCLC or LCNEC, but arise through independent mechanisms. Moreover, GSEA analysis showed that genes of the RB1 pathway were downregulated in SCLC but not in PCA. Our data also show that inactivation of chromatin-remodeling genes, specifically genes involved in histone methylation and subunits of the SWI/SNF complex, is sufficient to drive transformation in PCA.In a preliminary analysis of 15 LCNEC (Ref.2) we observed a predominance of mutations typical of SCLC, such as RB1, TP53, and CREBBP/EP300. In this larger series, we additionally found samples with mutations frequent in adenocarcinoma (AD) or squamous (SQ) lung cancer. We could then distinguish two well-defined groups of LCNEC', ' a SCLC-like group, carrying MYCL1 amplifications and mutations in both RB1 and TP53 genes; and an AD/SQ-like group, harbouring CDKN2A deletions, TTF1 amplifications, and frequent mutations in KEAP1 and STK11. Interestingly, RB1, STK11, and KEAP1 mutations happened in an almost mutually exclusive way. These data suggest that LCNEC might represent an evolutionary trunk that can branch to SCLC or AD/SQ, and also that LNETs and non-LNETs are not completely different entities. This is already suggested by the fact that one of the resistance mechanisms of EGFR-mutant adenocarcinomas to tyrosine-kinase inhibitors is through trans-differentiation to SCLC (Ref.3).Finally, we also identified new targetable driver genes in SCLC and LCNEC', ' FGFR1 amplifications were observed in 6% and 18% of the cases respectively; PTEN mutations were identified in 10% of the SCLC cases; and interestingly, one of the LCNEC samples (belonging to the SCLC-like group) harboured an activating RFWD2-NTRK1 fusion gene suggesting that fusions affecting NTRK1 may not only be a targetable opportunity for AD (Ref.4) but also for LCNEC and, based on the molecular similarities, also SCLC.(1) Peifer and Fernandez-Cuesta et al.
