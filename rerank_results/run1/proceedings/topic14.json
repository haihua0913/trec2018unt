Methods', '  25  patients had tumor specimen available at baseline and tested for c-KIT mutation, amplification and c-KIT expression. Twelve had available follow-up biopsies, 5 with a progressive disease (PD), 8 with a stable disease (SD), 1 with a partial response (PR). Follow-up biopsies were tested for c-KIT secondary mutations, gene copy number variation and expression related to angiogenesis, apoptosis and proliferation. IHC staining was performed on sections at baseline and after treatment for c-KIT, p-ERK, p-AKT and p-MEK.  Results', '  C-KIT expression was confirmed in all patients treated with nilotinib at baseline. The presence of a c-KIT exon 11 or 13 mutations was associated with clinical response. No secondary c-KIT mutations were detected at progression. c-KIT gene copy number revealed an amplification in 5 out of 25 patients prior to treatment without association with response rate. However, 1 SD patient had a decrease in c-KIT amplification after treatment. VEGFR-2 gene copy number whose co-amplification with c-KIT is frequent in other solid cancers was not associated with clinical outcome. pMek and pErk decreased in some SD and PR patients, with no variation of pAKT. Interestingly, using transcriptomic analyses FGF2 overexpression prior to treatment was observed in all PR and SD patients studied.  Conclusions', '  Clinical response is associated with c-KIT exon 11 or 13 mutations, and not with the sole amplification of c-KIT.

        "Background":"['KIT is a critical pathway for melanocytic homeostasis and it is often down-regulated in cutaneous melanoma. However, KIT activation plays a critical role in a subpopulation of melanomas especially those in acral locations and melanomas on chronically sun damaged skin. We analyzed exome and RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Network (321 cutaneous melanomas in the data set) to identify patterns unique to KIT activation. The melanomas were divided based on known mutually exclusive mutations (BRAF, NRAS and KIT) vs those without (WT). We compared RNA data between each group. KIT group had significantly higher expression of KIT than BRAF, NRAS and WT (p<0.01, FDR<0.01) and isoform 2 expression was higher than 1. KIT melanomas were found to overexpress Wnt pathway, pigmentation and genes involved epithelial-mesenchymal transition. From the exome data, germline SNPs with incidence in ethnic groups (Caucasian, Asian and African) and more likely to be present in a specific melanoma groups were selected. Comparing the 3 ethnicity groups across the 4 tumor groups Asian SNPs were significantly enhanced in KIT tumors, African in WT and Caucasian in BRAF and NRAS melanomas. We evaluated the tumors for the primary type of genetic damage. The three signatures that appeared most divergent were CC>TT for UV, (G/A)C(G)>(G/A)T(G) for deamination, and G>T for oxidative damage. UV and deamination appeared inversely proportional, while oxidative damage appeared to be independent of those other two features. KIT and WT had a greater% of non UV high deamination tumoral environments. A fraction of these tumors also had very high oxidative signatures. We then compared 2 KIT subgroups UV vs non UV (absence of CC>TT mutations) for germline ethnicity differences. Asian SNPs were highly increased in non UV subgroup whereas Caucasian SNPs were in UV subgroup. Further, we divided KIT non UV subgroup into deamination and oxidative damage subgroups and compared ethnicity differences. Deamination was significantly higher in Asians whereas oxidative damage was higher in Caucasians. A similar analysis was done to the WT group, where African SNPs were significantly increased in the non UV subgroup and were primarily associated with oxidative damage. This data implies that KIT mutant melanomas develop in a unique genetic and mutational environments and makes this an ideal system to in which study racial disparities at the molecular level.']",

This approach is now widely used to interrogate simple somatic mutations but experience with the analysis of copy number variations (CNV) is still limited. Here, we retrospectively analyzed CNVs in 822 cancer cases (n = 135 melanoma, n = 468 non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), n = 219 colorectal cancers (CRC)) that were sent to our institution for routine molecular profiling using a semiconductor based sequencing platform. Amplifications and deletions inferred by MPS coverage data were independently validated by a qPCR assay. We observed a decreasing frequency of CNV in clinically actionable genes from melanoma to NSCLC to colorectal cancer.Of 56 melanomas with genetic aberrations in BRAF, 31 showed co-occurring CNV in other genes, mainly affecting CDKN2A. Some tumors (5 cases each) revealed clustered deletions affecting either ABL1, NOTCH1, and RET or STK11, GNA11, and JAK3. 8.1% of the cases had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In the group of NRAS mutant tumors (n = 39), 26 showed co-occurring CNVs in other genes, such as CDKN2A and FGFR3, and 9 NRAS mutant cases were additionally mutated in BRAF. 19.1% had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In contrast to BRAF mutant tumors, we did not see any specific CNV clusters. In the group of BRAF/NRASwt tumors (n = 11), we observed 5 cases with co-amplification of KDR, KIT, PDGFRA and another 6 cases with KIT mutations. While co-amplified cases had many gene deletions, KIT mutated tumors harbored only very few genetic aberrations in other genes.Across both NSCLC data sets, we identified 14 cases with amplified EGFR (10 of them harboring co-occurring EGFR mutations) and detected 8 NSCLC with KRAS amplifications (of which 7 had co-occurring mutations of KRAS). KRAS mutated tumors displayed frequent amplifications in MYC (n = 10) and MDM2 (n = 5). Of the 22 BRAF mutant tumors, two harbored mutated KRAS. In contrast to melanoma, we observed no clustering of CNVs in BRAFmut NSCLCs. Within the group of KRAS/EGFR/BRAFwt tumors, we identified 15 cases harboring genetic aberrations in MET (n = 8 mutations, n = 7 amplifications).Compared to melanoma and NSCLC, the number of CNV in CRC was rather low. IGF2 amplifications were most prevalent (n = 13) followed by MYC (n = 9). Two cases showed amplified wild-type alleles of KRAS. Two KRAS mutant tumors showed concomitant amplification of NRAS and three cases harbored amplified EGFR.In conclusion we demonstrate that i) detection of CNVs by targeted MPS data obtained from FFPE material is feasible and ii) could be validated independently, iii) this approach enables detection of known CNV patterns, and iv) uncovers new CNV patterns in clinically actionable targets across cancers.']",

The major cause of death in patients with advanced KIT-mutant cancers is due to the development of KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant (TKI-resistant) metastatic disease. Drug resistance arises almost exclusively from secondary mutations within KIT, highlighting the importance of KIT in the proliferation and survival of these tumors. Methods', ' We performed a human kinase siRNA screen in multiple KIT-mutant cancer cell lines using viability as a read out. We defined candidate targets as those whose knockdown decreased viability in all cell lines. Validation and mechanistic studies were done using a library of KIT-mutant GIST and melanoma cells. Results', ' We identified lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) as candidate target in three KIT-mutant cell lines. LMTK3 silencing reduced the viability of all KIT-mutant GIST and melanoma cells tested to date, including cell lines with KIT TKI-resistance mutations. Importantly, LMTK3 silencing decreased the viability of KIT-mutant cells specifically, but not that of KIT-independent GIST and melanoma cells. Further, we found that decreased cell viability was due to induction of apoptosis, as assessed by measuring caspase 3 and 7 activity within 96 hours of LMTK3 silencing. LMTK3 knockdown also reduced tumor growth in vivo in a GIST xenograft model. Because these cells depend so heavily on KIT and the loss of KIT signaling results in cell death, we hypothesized that LMTK3 silencing may affect this pathway. Indeed, LMTK3 silencing decreased levels of autophosphorylated KIT. We also observed a significant decrease in total KIT protein expression. This phenotype and corresponding viability was rescued with exogenous expression of full length LMTK3.

A different pathogenesis has been proposed for ALM. Previous studies have profiled the importance of c-KIT, BRAF and NRAS mutations in melanoma treatment and prognosis. However, characterization of these somatic mutations in a specific non-Caucasian ALM population has not been reported. The Pacific Basin provides a unique opportunity to study diseases in diverse ethnic groups, including Pacific Islanders and Filipinos. We sought to determine the frequency of a triple negative genotype in our multi-ethnic cohort. Methods', ' IRB approval was obtained for this molecular analysis. From 1999 to 2011, 12 non-Caucasian patients (8-Filipino, 3-Pacific Islander and 1-Vietnamese) histologically confirmed to have ALM were evaluated at a tertiary institution. Data including age, gender, tumor location, Breslow thickness, Clark level, ulceration, regression, and mitoses per mm squared were compiled. Direct sequencing (c-KIT [Exons 8,9,11,13,17,18], NRAS [Exons 2,3]) and real-time PCR (BRAF [Exon 15]) was performed on formalin-fixed/ paraffin-embedded archived biospecimens (primary lesions). Results', ' Our findings demonstrated that 7/12 (58%) patients exhibited the triple negative genotype. Mutually exclusive somatic mutations (4 c-KIT and 1 BRAF) were identified in the remaining 5/12 (42%) patients. Those in the triple negative group trended toward a deeper Breslow thickness, when compared to those with a mutation (depth 4.73 mm vs. 3.07 mm). Demographics of the entire non-Caucasian cohort included a mean age of 72.0 years old (range 52-87) and male gender 6/12 (50%). Tumor location principally involved the foot 10/12 (83%); mean Breslow thickness was 4.04 mm (range 2.20-7.75), Clark IV or higher 11/12 (92%), ulceration 8/12 (67%), regression 12/12 (100%), and mean mitoses per mm squared was 5.71 (range 0-30). Conclusions', ' Non-Caucasian patients with ALM were found to have a high prevalence of the triple negative genotype. Those within that group appeared to have thicker tumors. Nearly half of our cohort had thick primary lesions with a high propensity for ulceration. This is the first study to our knowledge that has profiled somatic mutations (c-KIT, BRAF, NRAS) in a multi-ethnic population of ALM patients and examined the histologic correlates of a triple negative genotype.

        "Background":"['Melanoma causes the greatest morbidity and mortality of all skin cancers and often harbors amplifications or activating mutations in KIT, a type III transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) involved in cancer cell growth, migration, invasion and metastasis. At present, no treatment that provide either sufficient response rates or a significant prolongation of overall survival are available for melanoma. In the last decade, several inhibitors of RTK (RTKi) have been developed for the treatment of cancer, however, a number of short-comings was observed. Therefore, novel TK inhibitors with improved selectivity were developed for the treatment of diseases associated with KIT activation. Masitinib (AB1010), a RTKi capable of blocking selectively KIT, is one such new drug. Using B16 melanoma subcutaneous graft on C57Bl6 mice, we demonstrate that Masitinib is able to limit tumor growth in vivo and increase mice survival. This anti-tumoral effect was not observed for other RTKi targeting KIT. Suprisingly, Masitinib has no effect on melanoma proliferation in vitro, suggesting instead that modulation on tumor environment takes place. Indeed, mast cells that accumulate in the tumors secrete several biologically active factors involved in the modulation of tumor growth. In vivo, Masitinib treatment completely abrogates mast cell maturation and migration resulting in decreased tumor invasion and down-regulation of several angiogenic factors. Using a mouse line deficient for mast cells (Wsh/Wsh), we confirmed that Masitinib effect is in part dependent of its inhibition on mast cell migration and maturation. Indeed, additional effect occurs on macrophage polarization leaning from tolerogenic toward anti-tumoral phenotype. Furthermore, in vivo macrophage depletion favored tumor promotion and reverses Masitinib effect on tumor growth. The results provided by this study suggest that Masitinib may be a useful therapy on melanoma by its dual role on tumor environment. It can block mast cell maturation and infiltration in the tumor site, avoiding the angiogenic effects of mast cells. It can revert tumor tolerent macrophage status leading to an increased inflammatory activity within the tumor microenvironment.These effects are not observed only on melanoma, but also on other types of cancer, suggesting the cellular mechanisms triggered by Masitinib occur in various tumoral process. For instance, a phase III clinical trial with Masitinib as GIST treatment is currently ongoing.']",

        "Background":"['Multiple cancers, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and melanoma, have been shown to be caused by somatic activating mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT. The major cause of death in patients with advanced KIT-mutant cancers is due to KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant metastatic disease. Resistance develops almost exclusively because of secondary mutations within KIT, highlighting the importance of KIT in the proliferation and survival of these tumors. Therefore, strategies that affect KIT protein expression and maturation may be therapeutic. In order to identify regulators of KIT that may represent novel targets, we performed an siRNA screen in multiple KIT-mutant cancer cell lines. From these screens we identified lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) as a novel KIT regulator and potential target in KIT-mutant cancers. LMTK3 has been implicated as an important protein in multiple cancers, including leukemia, breast, and colon cancer. However, the oncogenic function of LMTK3 is not entirely clear. Despite its name, lemur tyrosine kinase 3 is, in fact, a serine/ threonine kinase. Beyond its enzymatic kinase function, LMTK3 has also been shown to have important scaffolding functions. LMTK3 has not been previously known to interact with KIT, but does regulate the stability of other receptors. We have found that LMTK3 silencing reduced the viability of all KIT-mutant GIST and melanoma cells tested to date, including those with ATP binding pocket and activation loop resistance mutations. Importantly, LMTK3 silencing decreased the viability of KIT-mutant cells specifically, as silencing of LMTK3 in cells lacking KIT mutations did not affect their viability. Further, we found the decrease in cell viability was due to induction of apoptosis, as seen by cleavage of PARP within 96 hours of LMTK3 silencing. Because these cells depend so heavily on KIT and loss of KIT signaling results in cell death, we hypothesized that LMTK3 silencing may be affecting this pathway. Indeed, with LMTK3 silencing there was a significant decrease in phosphorylated KIT (Y719), which was accompanied by decreased phospho-AKT (S473). We also observed a robust decrease in total KIT protein levels. However, there was no decrease in KIT transcript levels, suggesting that LMTK3 plays a role in regulating KIT at the protein level. While other KIT protein regulators, such as HSP90, have been suggested as therapeutic targets for GIST, the ubiquitous functions of these targets makes these treatments sub-optimal, often causing toxicity. Silencing of LMTK3, on the other hand, specifically kills KIT-mutant cancer cells. Furthermore, as a kinase, inhibition of LMTK3 by a small molecule may be possible, and we are in the process of identifying LMTK3 inhibitors. LMTK3 is a positive regulator of oncogenic KIT in GIST and melanoma and represents a novel, tractable target in KIT-mutant cancers.']",

Uveal melanoma is characterized by oncogenic mutations in Gnaq and Gna11, which activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK). Furthermore, both primary and metastatic UM are characterized by genetic abnormalities, including the amplification of the chromosomal arm 8q and monosomy of chromosome 3, which are significantly associated with poor prognosis. The oncogene MYC, which is located on 8q24.1, is amplified in nearly 70% of uveal melanoma, and is also regulated by the MAPK pathway. Chromatin regulators have become attractive targets for cancer therapy. In particular, the BET-bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 has shown selective inhibition of c-Myc expression, followed by the suppression of c-Myc-dependent target genes. We examined the effects of JQ1 in a panel of 8 UM cell lines, including cell lines with Gnaq/Gna11 mutations (92.1, Omm1.3, Mel270, Mel202, Omm1), a cell line with MYC amplification (Mel290), and cells without either mutation or amplification (C918, Mel285). The Gnaq/Gna11 mutant cells were the most sensitive to growth inhibition at nanomolar concentrations of JQ1 (IC50=200nM), followed by the cell line with amplified MYC (IC50=1M), while the cells without mutation or amplification exhibited little inhibition. We also examined the biochemical effects of JQ1 treatment, which caused a dose- and time-dependent suppression of c-Myc as well as survivin, XIAP, ERK1 and E2F1, while p21and the pro-apoptotic protein Bim were induced in all the cell lines. Interestingly, JQ1 also suppressed the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL and induced PARP cleavage only in the Gnaq/Gna11 mutant cells.

MITF is also a lineage- survival oncogene in melanoma and recently, it has been shown that germline mutations in MITF predispose to this malignant disease. In melanoma, MITF has been proposed to act as a rheostat where high levels of MITF contribute to a proliferative phenotype whereas low levels result in a more invasive phenotype. The biological output generated by high or low levels of MITF is well characterized. However, how the activity of MITF is regulated to mediate these effects is less well known. It has been proposed that MITF is phosphorylated upon ligand induced activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase c- KIT. C-KIT engages the MAP kinase signaling cascade where ERK2 directly phosphorylates Ser73 of MITF and P90RSK phosphorylates the Ser409 residue of MITF. As a consequence, MITF activity increases and the protein is subjected to ubiquitin dependent degradation.Here, we show for the first time that c-KIT induces phosphorylation of MITF through the survival PI3 kinase- AKT pathway, the P38 stress pathway as well as the well-known MAP kinase-ERK signaling pathway. In addition, we show that the SRC kinase upstream of ERK is essential for c-KIT induced MITF activation. Moreover, we used several c-KIT phosphorylation site mutants to map the specific sites that are involved in the mediating transcription activation potential of MITF. These mutants also show less effects on MITF-mediated proliferation.We have generated phosphorylation specific antibodies against Ser73 and Ser409 of MITF and characterized the phosphorylation pattern of MITF using these reagents. Our results suggest that there is a particular relationship between Ser73 and Ser409 with subsequent effects on function.

        "Background":"['Background', '  An estimated 70,000 diagnoses of brain metastases (BM) occur each year in the U.S., with an incidence of 5-7% in breast and melanoma and 20% in lung cancer.  Despite its prominence, the biology of BM remains poorly understood.  Several theories of BM development exist, including the linear progression model, which suggests that the metastatic capabilities of tumor cells develop at primary sites following the accumulation of alterations. The parallel progression model argues that tumor cells disseminate early and accumulate changes independently at the secondary site.  We compare the tumor profiles of BM from common cancers to understand the biology and to identify differential treatment strategies.  Methods', ' Tumor samples were profiled using a multiplatform service (Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ), including sequencing (Sanger, NGS), protein expression (IHC) and amplification (ISH).  Results', '  5,391 NSCLC (293 BM, 5,098 lung), 3,595 breast cancer (99 BM, 3496 breast) and 761 melanoma (101 BM, 660 skin) unpaired samples were included. No significant differences were found in 48 genes between BM and the primary tumor sites, with the exception of PIK3CA in breast cancer, which was mutated less in BM vs. the breast samples (10% vs. 26%, p=0.02). In contrast,  expression of TOP2A, TOPO1 and TS, and amplification of EGFR, were more prevalent in BM as compared to the primary sites (Table).  Conclusions', '  A similar genetic landscape with limited differences was seen in BM of NSCLC, melanoma and breast cancer compared to primary tumors.  The limited differences are more consistent with a linear progression model of cancer metastasis. Additionally ,this suggests that both primary tumor and BM would respond to similar chemotherapeutics with the consideration of effective blood-brain barrier-penetrant drugs. Small molecule inhibitors of EGFR could be considered due to increased EGFR amplification and the higher TOP2A, TOPO1 expression prompts consideration of topoisomerase inhibitors like etoposide or irinotecan.

Similar results were obtained using the Entrogen assay, with a PPA of 68.4% (26/38). The 2 most common activating mutations, V600E and V600K, had a similar PPA with both Qiagen and Entrogen tests.

The QS3D digital PCR system concluded on the presence of a BRAF mutation in only 20/34 samples (PPA = 58.8%) mostly because of an insufficient number of circulating DNA copies to reach a relevant statistic value. Conclusions', ' The Qiagen and the Entrogen assays are based on allele-specific amplification, a technique easy to use without a specific training, unlike dPCR which requires specific equipment and training to acquire technical and interpretation skills. The unexpectedly low PPA of dPCR was attributed to the limited amount of DNA extracted from some samples.

Eighty percent of GISTs harbor activating mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT. Despite progress in medical treatment of GIST, advanced disease remains incurable. In addition to GIST, activating KIT mutations are found in cases of mast cell neoplasms, AML, melanoma and seminoma. Therefore, there is a compelling need to identify new targets whose inhibition is synergistic when combined with biochemical inhibition of KIT. Based on shared oncogenic kinase mechanisms with CML, we hypothesized that combined inhibition of KIT and a novel Wnt/Ca++/Calcineurin/NFAT pathway would synergistically inhibit the proliferation of KIT mutant cells.Experimental methods', ' We sequentially combined four different calcineurin inhibitors with five different KIT inhibitors and measured cell proliferation and caspase 3/7activity in nine unique KIT mutant cell lines. Using the Chou and Talalay method we calculated combination indices to quantify drug-drug interactions. Changes in NFAT phosphorylation and localization in KIT mutant cells were assessed by immunoblotting. Finally, we measured NFAT transcriptional activity using an NFAT-responsive reporter cell line.Results', ' In contrast to other cellular models, NFAT appeared to be constitutively active and localized in the nucleus in many KIT mutant cell lines. We observed synergy when we combined a calcineurin inhibitor with a KIT inhibitor in all KIT mutant cell lines where NFAT was constitutively active. Combination index (CI) values for the different KIT mutant cell lines ranged from 0.3-0.5. To investigate whether NFAT was required for this synergy, we combined NFAT specific inhibitors with KIT inhibitors and found synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation. We created a KIT-mutant reporter cell line where NFAT binding drives the expression of luciferase. As expected, NFAT transcriptional activity decreased when our promoter-reporter cell line was treated with calcineurin inhibitors and increased with TPA and ionomycin treatment. Unexpectedly, we also found that KIT inhibitors decreased NFAT transcriptional activity in this cell model.Conclusions', ' These data indicate that combination therapy using a calcineurin phosphatase inhibitor and a KIT kinase inhibitor results in synergistic killing of KIT mutant cells. Additionally, the constitutive activation of NFAT in these cell lines indicate aberrant signaling in the Wnt/Ca2+/calcineurin/NFAT pathway, which has not been previously reported in KIT mutant cell lines. The observed synergy between NFAT inhibitors and KIT inhibitors suggests this effect is mediated by NFAT rather than other calcineurin targets. Finally, the fact that KIT inhibitors modulated NFAT transcriptional activity suggests crosstalk between KIT and NFAT signaling pathways.']",

DCC-2618 is a robust Type II switch pocket control inhibitor which potently inhibits exon 17 KIT mutations that are resistant to conventional TKIs.Experimental procedures', 'DCC-2618 was tested for inhibition of KIT isoforms using a standard PK/LDH coupled spectrophotometric assay. CHO cells were transiently transfected to express mutant KIT or PDGFR constructs. Transfected cells were treated with a range of DCC-2618 and levels of phosphorylated KIT or PDGFR in cell lysates were determined by ELISA or western blot. Cell proliferation of several cell lines was measured using the fluorescent dye resazurin. Experiments were performed in triplicate. In vivo xenograft models were performed at Molecular Imaging, Inc.

In CHO cells transiently transfected with both single and double (primary/secondary) KIT mutants, DCC-2618 robustly inhibited exon 17, exon 9/13, exon 9/14, and exon 9/17 KIT mutants, as well as exon 11/17 KIT mutants, including exon 17 D816V, D816G, D820A, D820E, D820Y, N822K, N822Y, N822H, and Y823D primary or secondary mutations.DCC-2618 inhibited wild type KIT phosphorylation in the MO7e cell line (IC50 36 nM). DCC-2618 potently inhibited KIT activation in human GIST cell lines, including GIST T1 (exon 11 deletion, IC50 2 nM), GIST 430 (exon 11 deletion/exon 13 V654A, IC50 7 nM), and GIST 48 (exon 11 V560D/exon 17 D820A, IC50 53 nM). In the murine mastocytosis P815 cell line expressing the exon 17 D816Y mutation, DCC-2618 potently inhibited cell proliferation (IC50 2 nM).In vivo, DCC-2618 administration at 50 mg/kg afforded an ED90 for inhibition of KIT phosphorylation in the GIST T1 xenograft model, corresponding to an EC90 concentration of  470 ng/mL. When give twice daily, this oral dose resulted in almost complete tumor stasis. This dose of DCC-2618 produced tumor regressions in a patient derived xenograft (PDX) GIST expressing KIT exon 11 delW557K558/exon 17 Y823D, and also in a KIT exon 17 N822K AML xenograft model.Conclusion', ' DCC-2618 is a potent inhibitor of singly and doubly mutated KIT characterized by primary exon 9 or exon 11 mutations paired with secondary mutations in exons 13, 14 or 17.

DMs are dermal tumors characterized by spindled melanocytes situated within abundant desomplastic stroma. These unusual histological features commonly lead to misdiagnosis. Currently, there are no known genetic drivers. A better understanding of the underlying biology of desmoplastic melanoma would provide biomarkers and therapeutic opportunities. Towards this goal, we performed low-coverage genome and high-coverage exome sequencing of 20 DMs in a discovery cohort, followed by targeted sequencing of 293 candidate genes on a validation cohort of 42 cases. Additionally, high-resolution aCGH was performed on samples from both cohorts. A high mutation burden (median 62 mutations/Mb) ranked desmoplastic melanoma among the most highly mutated cancers sequenced to date. Mutation patterns strongly indicate that UV-radiation is the dominant mutagen and implicate a superficially located cell of origin despite their predominantly intradermal presentation. Novel alterations included recurrent promoter mutations and amplification of NF-kappa B inhibitor epsilon, NFKBIE (IkB) in 14.5% of samples. The promoter mutations typically affect both alleles and occur over a highly conserved DNA region. The mutations are predicted to disrupt a canonical Ets Like Factor 1 (ELF1) binding site. In total, these data imply aberrant NF-kappa B signaling as a pathogenic feature of desmoplastic melanoma. Commonly mutated oncogenes in melanomas, in particular BRAF V600E and NRAS Q61K/R, were absent. Instead, other genetic alterations known to activate the MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades were identified in 73% of samples, affecting NF1, CBL, ERBB2, MAP2K1, MAP3K1, BRAF, EGFR, PTPN11, MET, RAC1, SOS2, NRAS, and PIK3CA. Rb and p53 pathway alterations occurred respectively in 71% and 66% of tumors, affecting RB1, FBXW7, CDK4, PPP6C, CCND1, CDKN2A, TP53, and MDM2. Finally, TERT promoter mutations or amplifications occurred in 90% of tumors. The consequences of the mutations on protein expression levels was confirmed by immunostaining for NF1, EGFR, Rb, CDK4, CCND1, p16, p53, and Mdm2. Collectively, many of these oncogenic mutations are potentially druggable.

        "Background":"['Melanoma is the malignant tumor of melanocytes and considered as one of the most aggressive human cancers. While the worldwide incidence rate of melanoma has increased during the last decade, current therapies for melanoma do not provide long-term effect. The highly heterogeneous expression signature of melanoma underlies the inefficient therapy and accentuates the inevitability of profound molecular understanding of melanoma, its maintenance and progression. In this study, we aimed to reveal the complex patterns of distinct molecular mechanisms underlying the progression and maintenance of melanoma using high-throughput sequencing technologies. Series of melanoma tumor tissues representing discrete stages of the malignant progression were deeply sequenced. Integrative analysis revealed hard-wired genomic aberrations and associated transcriptomic consequences. These genomic aberrations included clusters of oncogenes brought together by structural variations, which cooperated in their amplifications and subsequent up-regulated expressions. We believe that these hard-wired genetic changes are biologically significant; they sustain the survival of the tumor and offer the advantage of the distant metastasis. We reconstituted the architecture of melanoma progression and maintenance and we identified gene cassettes with a putative role in sustaining tumor growth. The correlation of these gene cassettes with the cancer phenotype and the feasibility of these putative oncogenes as candidates for targeted therapy were addressed using cell-based assays on a high content screening platform. Analysis of the matched cell lines derived from the same patient offered a valuable resource for in vitro manipulation, testing of drugs and functional validation. A detailed molecular characterization of the functionally validated genes and their contribution in the cancer signaling pathways will provide a better understanding of the molecular basis of tumor evolution.']",

        "Background":"['The BRAFV600E mutation is frequently observed in over 60% of melanomas. Development of the small molecule inhibitor PLX4032, which specifically targets the mutated BRAF protein, offers a novel therapeutic approach by effectively blocking the activation of key signaling molecules of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, such as Mek and Erk, effectively leading to arrest in cell proliferation. Provided that MAPK signaling targets the micropthalmia transcription factor (MITF), which is linked to the expression of various melanoma associated antigens (MAAs), we hypothesized that the inhibition of BRAFV600E can modulate the expression of MAAs. Since MAAs are essential in the development of a melanoma vaccine, due to their increased immunogenicity, altering their expression can be a useful immunotherapeutic approach to targeting melanoma. Using patient derived melanoma cell lines, which express various MAAs; our laboratory has developed a vaccinia virus based immunotherapeutic vaccine. These melanoma cell lines have been characterized by their status of BRAFV600E mutation and found to be either homozygous or heterozygous for the mutation. Inhibition of two key MAPK pathway molecules, namely Mek and Erk, denotes that the melanoma cell lines are responsive to PLX4032. Phenotypically, the cells invasive and migratory properties were also modulated upon treatment with PLX4032. Moreover, we observed that the expression of various MAAs was enhanced upon treatment with PLX4032. An amplification of gp100, MART-1 and tyrosinase expression on the RNA level as well as on the protein level was observed. Lastly, expression of MMAs was conserved in vivo following the analysis of melanoma cell xenografts in BALB/c nude mice. Based on our observations in that PLX4032 modulates MMA expression, further studies are warranted to determine the clinical effectiveness of combinational immunologic therapy using BRAFV600E inhibitors with our vaccinia virus melanoma cell line derived preparation.']",

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the role of Wip1 in melanoma progression and to evaluate correlations between Wip1 expression and clinical pathological parameters, such as grade and metastasis. In order to investigate the role of Wip1 in melanoma progression, we crossed Grm1 transgenic (TG3) mice, a well-characterized mouse model for melanoma, with Wip1 null mice (PPM1D-/-) to generate TG3', 'PPM1D-/- mice, and observed the rate of spontaneous melanoma formation. Compared with TG3 mice, TG3', 'PPM1D-/- mice exhibited dramatic reductions in melanoma incidence and metastasis to lymph nodes, lungs, liver and spleen.

Several targeted therapies, such as imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib, bind to c-Kit and are approved for clinical use. However, due to their insufficient activity on cancers expressing wildtype c-Kit or insensitive forms of mutant c-Kit, the clinical response has been quite varied. Moreover, despite initial anti-cancer benefits in c-Kit mutant settings (such as in GIST), resistance to c-Kit inhibitor therapies emerges due primarily to the development of additional mutations in c-Kit.In an attempt to broaden the treatment of patients whose cancers express c-Kit (wildtype and mutant) and to enhance potency with comparable or better tolerability than the current therapeutics, we developed a c-Kit-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that disrupts tumor growth through anti-mitotic activity. Hybridomas from mice immunized with the c-Kit extracellular domain (ECD) were screened for selective c-Kit binding and degradation. A humanized lead antibody (Ab) was identified, which rapidly internalized upon binding cell-surface c-Kit, but did not block binding to the c-Kit ligand (SCF). The Ab exhibited minimal-to-no cytotoxicity against c-Kit+ cell lines in vitro. To generate cytotoxic activity and to potentially overcome resistance to current c-Kit-targeting therapies, the Ab was conjugated to the maytansinoid DM1, a powerful anti-tubulin agent, via a non-cleavable linker, SMCC (technology licensed from ImmunoGen, Inc.). The ADC demonstrated robust anti-proliferative activity against cell lines expressing mutant c-Kit (GIST) and wildtype c-Kit (SCLC, AML) in vitro. The ADC also demonstrated potent anti-cancer activity in GIST and SCLC tumor xenograft models in vivo.In summary, the anti-c-Kit ADC is highly selective and active against cancers with elevated c-Kit expression regardless of their mutational status, thus representing a promising novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of c-Kit+ solid tumors, such as GIST and SCLC, as well as hematological malignancies such as AML and aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM).']",

In addition, we screened a panel of melanoma cells with a highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 (PD-991) and performed gene expression and mutation analysis on these cells to explore possible genomic predictors of sensitivity.Genomic analysis revealed that 75% of primary melanomas had at least one CNV in the CDK4 pathway, with 55% showing a loss of CDKN2A. 28% of melanomas had two or more CNVs and melanomas with two or more CNVs involving CCND1 had worse overall survival (HR 5.56, P=0.02). From the cell line studies low CDKN2A mRNA expression, mutation or loss predicted sensitivity to PD-991 with 23 out of 27 mutant/loss cell lines being sensitive compared to only 3/7 wild type lines (p<0.03). Expression of CDK4, CCND1 or other cyclins or CDK-inhibitors did not predict sensitivity to PD-991. PD-991 induced an increase in both cell size and SA--galactosidase activity that is indicative of a senescent phenotype, and this was associated with cells having wild type p53. In summary, genomic alterations in the CDK4 pathway are frequent in melanoma and are associated with worse survival, particularly when melanomas harbor two or more CNVs involving CCND1. CDK4 inhibition induces a senescent phenotype in melanoma cells that is associated with loss of CDKN2A and wild type TP53.

Conclusions', ' MRI is a more sensitive screening test than cfDNA for detection of hepatic metastasis in uveal melanoma. cfDNA negative for G-protein/MYC alterations correlates with the absence of clinically detectable disease (100% specificity) and a positive result in the adjuvant setting should prompt further evaluation.

Methods', '    We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on 8 pairs of metastatic tumor and germline DNA from 3 superficial spreading (SSM), 3 nodular (NM) and 2 acral lentiginous (ALM) melanoma patients. For two of the NM patients we also performed WES on DNA from corresponding primary lesions. Tumor DNA was isolated from FFPE samples in quantities that facilitated an average coverage of 100X for 95% of the exon regions; on average, 60M reads per sample were obtained, without applying whole genome amplification. We performed variant calling using paired samples with Somatic Sniper, SAM tools and MuTect. We annotated all the variants and applied functional filters to come up with a candidate list of mutations.  Results', '    Our analysis confirmed known mutations that occur predominantly in each subtype (BRAF V600E more prevalent in SSM than in NM and absent in ALM, ALM being NF1 mutant but not BRAF V600E or NRAS Q61 mutant) and further revealed subtype-restricted somatic mutations in genes not previously reported as associated with melanoma. In particular, matrix-remodeling associated 5 was found to be frequently mutated in the SSM samples tested but not in the ALM or NM samples, and PFN1P2 (profilin 1 pseudogene) in NM samples but not in the ALM or SSM samples. Sanger sequencing is underway to validate the presence of the selected mutations in a larger independent cohort of patient specimens representing the 3 histologic subtypes.

This pathway is deregulated in 90% of melanomas, through amplification or increased expression of CDK4 or Cyclin D1 (CCND1), or reduced expression of the CDK inhibitor p16INK4A (CDKN2A).To explore if CDK4 may be a viable target for the treatment of human melanoma we screened a panel of melanoma cell lines with the highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 (PD-991). A majority of cell lines were found to be sensitive to PD-991, although there was a distinct population of resistant cell lines. In sensitive melanoma cell lines, treatment with PD-991 resulted in loss of hyperphosphorylated RB and a concomitant G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Treated cells displayed an enlarged flattened morphology and an increase in SA--galactosidase staining compared to vehicle controls, indicative of cellular senescence. RB-null cell lines were resistant to CDK4/6 inhibition, and did not display cell cycle arrest or senescence. Expression and mutational analysis was performed to identify additional genomic predictors of sensitivity and resistance. Loss of CDKN2A/p16 correlated with sensitivity to PD-991 (p<0.02), and this was confirmed at the level of protein expression. Mutation of p53 and the corresponding low expression of p53 targets p21 and MDM2 correlated with resistance (p<0.0001). There was no increase in p53 transcriptional targets or evidence of apoptosis in response to PD-991 treatment of sensitive cells, and senescence occurs in both p53 WT and mutant cells, indicating that this response does not require functional p53. However, in p53 WT cells, combination treatment with PD-991 and the p53 pathway activator Nutlin3a results in increased sensitivity to PD-991 compared to treatment with PD-991 alone. This additive effect is not observed in p53 mutant cells, suggesting there is a functional role for WT p53 in the response to PD-991.Conclusions', ' These preliminary data identify RB, p16 and p53 as predictors of response to PD-991, and support further evaluation of CDK4/6 inhibitors in melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['The fact that melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, is driven by multiple combinations of genetic lesions has supported the use of genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models in validating the etiological and biological roles of oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Most of the currently studied mouse melanoma models are driven by RAS/RAF/MAPK activation via activating RAS or RAF mutations in combination with loss of INK4A/ARF or PTEN; therefore, BRAF/NRAS wild-type melanoma remains less well characterized and the overall survival of patients with metastatic BRAF/NRAS wild-type melanoma remains poor.In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that NEDD9 could synergize with the loss of PTEN and INK4A/ARF in melanoma tumorigenesis. This hypothesis is based on our observation of an inverse correlation between PTEN expression and levels of NEDD9 gene expression in human melanoma samples. NEDD9 (neural precursor derived, developmentally downregulated gene 9) was previously identified by us as a target of a recurrent focal amplification, associated with acquisition of metastatic potential in the RAS-Ink/Arf model. We have shown that NEDD9 is up-regulated in 3550% of metastatic melanomas and enhances proliferation and invasion. First, we demonstrated that NEDD9 cooperated with PTEN loss in Ink4a/Arf-/- melanocytes to enhance cell proliferation, anchorage independent growth, and invasion in vitro. Additionally, when melanocytes were injected into nude mice either subcutaneously or intravenously, NEDD9 overexpression facilitated increased tumor growth and lung seeding, respectively. Further analysis showed that NEDD9 expression correlated with increased phosphorylation of ERK, SFKs (Src family kinases), AKT2, and STAT3. Of these pathways we have demonstrated through the use of small molecule inhibitors that both ERK and AKT2 signaling are required for the enhanced anchorage independent growth observed in NEDD9 overexpressing melanocytes. In addition, we generated a mouse model based on loss of PTEN and INK4A/ARF with or without NEDD9 upregulation. To do this, we generated a tet-inducible NEDD9 allele that carries a doxycycline-responsive, melanocyte-targeted NEDD9. These mice were crossed with a strain containing floxed PTEN and INK4A/ARF in combination with a melanocyte-targeted CreERT2. The development of cutaneous and ocular melanomas in these mice was enhanced by NEDD9 induction.

This is especially true for BRAF inhibitors, were multiple mechanisms of resistance have been uncovered. However, the lack of dependable models to develop approaches to overcome resistance, poses a real challenge for clinical decisions on second line therapies. In addition, combination therapies necessary to achieve long term responses increase the number of possibilities to be assessed. In this study, we developed patient derived xenograft (PDX) models from BRAF inhibitor resistant patients and, after characterization, tested rational second line combination therapies in co-clinical trials.Fresh tumor tissue from 12 patients after progression on vemurafenib or dabrafenib was implanted into immune deficient NSG mice. Once the tumor grafts were established, mice were continually dosed with PLX4720 to approximate clinical plasma levels to preserve the resistant phenotype. Xenografts were then characterized for genomic alterations and pathway activation status using a targeted sequencing array and a reverse phase protein array, respectively. We found at least 2 and up to 9 known deleterious alterations in all samples, many of which have been described as conferring resistance. The protein array clustered into two major groups', ' MAPK pathway activated and PI3K pathway activated, again consistent with previous reports. Integrating these data allowed us to design rational combination therapies for in vivo testing. We treated a PDX model with MET amplification and high phospho c-Met with the BRAF inhibitor LGX818 20mg/kg QD, the MEK inhibitor MEK162 3mg/kg QD, and the c-Met inhibitor INC280 25mg/kg QD (all p.o.). Although INC280 alone led to significant decrease in tumor growth, only the LGX818/ MEK162/ INC280 triple combination led to complete and sustained tumor regression in all mice. Further, we tested a second PDX model with a MET amplification (albeit broader and lower) but baseline pMET on the protein level. In this model, INC280 did not show any antitumor effect confirming the specificity for c-Met and the importance of validating genomic data.In summary, using our BRAF inhibitor resistant PDX model pipeline we were not only able to identify actionable alterations in all models, but also to test rational second line combination therapies in pre-clinical in vivo trials. Genomic data alone might not be sufficient to accurately predict therapy responses and protein arrays were a valuable tool to validate deleterious alteration calls.

Several tumor cell enrichment methods were tested (CellSearch and size-based enrichment technologies), however, failed to process cell suspensions generated from lymph nodes due to clumping of cells during the enrichment procedure. Tumor cell enrichment using MACS depletion of CD45+ cells delivered approx. 50% of spiked-in cell line cells with a mean depletion rate of lymphocytes and erythrocytes > 98%.

We successfully applied the workflow to first SLN samples from melanoma patients.The established workflow enables a standardized detection of single DCCs from lymph nodes of melanoma patients applicable in clinical diagnostic labs.

Melanoma developed in 100% (8/8) of the DCT-TVA/BrafCA mice following Cre mediated Braf activation combined with Pten and Ink4a/Arf loss; median survival was 62  6.7 days in this cohort. The incidence was reduced to 43% (6/14) if Pten was retained (Pten+/+ mice); median survival of tumor bearing mice in this group was 72  6.7 days. Kaplan Meier survival analysis revealed a highly significant difference between these cohorts (P = 0.01). Interestingly, Akt expression could substitute for Pten loss in this context. Melanoma developed in 88% (15/17) of the DCT-TVA/BrafCA mice following viral delivery of activated Akt and Cre, which mediated Braf activation combined with Ink4a/Arf loss; median survival of tumor bearing mice in this group was 60  6.6 days. Kaplan Meier survival analysis revealed that there was no significant difference between cohorts with Pten loss or Akt expression (P = 0.658). Expression of virally delivered Akt in the absence of Cre did not lead to tumor formation in control cohorts (0/7) and no uninfected mice developed melanoma (0/14). Histological examination of the tumors generated in the BrafCA mice with delivery of Cre and Akt viruses demonstrated that they were very similar to tumors lacking Pten. Importantly, the tumors were similar to human melanoma consisting primarily of short spindle cells exhibiting high grade nuclear features and prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures were abundant, and some tumors possessed giant cells with epitheliod features. Occasional neoplasms exhibited regions of necrosis. Extensive lung metastases were evident following Pten loss or Akt expression, but not in tumors lacking activation of Akt, confirming a role of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in melanoma progression and metastasis. Our ongoing experiments seek to further characterize the role(s) of the PI3K/AKT pathway in melanoma progression.']",

From FFPE melanomas matching the training and validation cohorts of the above FF melanoma study (n=125), RNA was prepared and transcribed into cDNA. Following cDNA pre-amplification, expression of the 9 signature genes, 2 additional candidate genes, and 3 housekeeping genes was quantified by real-time PCR. Correlation of gene expression with OS was evaluated using Cox regression analysis. Expression of a signature of 8 out of 11 genes (risk gene', ' KBTBD10; protective genes', ' DCD, GBP4, COL6A6, PIP, SCGB1D2, SCGB2A2, KRT9) was associated with OS in univariate regression and Kaplan Meier analysis.

The misclassification rates were 20% overall, 13.8% for low risk, and 5.7% for double low-risk (combined with AJCC staging). The risk score complemented and refined conventional AJCC staging. Thus, the FF melanoma risk score was successfully transfered onto FFPE melanomas.In order to validate the FFPE melanoma risk score, we analyzed signature expression in an independent cohort of 130 selected FFPE melanomas, which were particularly difficult to classify by AJCC staging (misclassification rate 40.8%), in order to stringently test the performance of the risk score. The misclassification rate of the FFPE melanoma risk score was comparable, even slightly better (39.2%) than that of AJCC staging, confirming its prognostic performance.The FFPE melanoma risk score was also externally validated in a Molecular Diagnostics Lab (Dermatologikum Hamburg). The concordance of melanoma classification exceeded 85%, demonstrating technical robustness of the risk score.We have established and independently as well as externally validated a quantitative, robust prognostic FFPE melanoma risk score that is complementary to AJCC staging in predicting outcome.

        "Background":"['Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is an essential instrument to maintain genomic stability in eukaryotes especially towards ultraviolet radiation (UVR). There is profound knowledge of the mechanistic execution of NER, however its regulation is not well understood. Here we provide evidence that the lineage-dependent oncogene MITF regulates the functional interface between NER and transcription through transactivation of XPG and GTF2H1, which constitute core elements of the NER and general transcription factor machineries, respectively.For this purpose, flow cytometry and microscopy fluorescence assays were applied to evaluate the temporal repair kinetics of DNA lesions after UVR in the presence and upon depletion of MITF in human primary melanocytes and several melanoma cell lines. Moreover, ChIP and luciferase reporter assays were performed to show the in vivo occupancy and a MITF dependent transactivation of the XPG and GTF2H1 promoters. Transcriptome as well as tissue microarrays (TMA) analysis were used to demonstrate the relationship between MITF and TFIIH. Finally, in vivo experiments were performed utilizing a subcutaneous xenograft tumor model in SCID mice to confirm our hypothesis.Our results showed that the NER/TFIIH complex is controlled by MITF in the presence and absence of UVR mediated genotoxic attack resulting in nucleotide repair deficiency and breakdown of global transcription upon MITF depletion. Importantly, in primary human melanoma the TFIIH subunit GTF2H1, which is involved in NER and RNA transcription, is linked to MITF abundance and prognostic melanoma stage. Moreover, RNA-interference mediated repression of GTF2H1 led to a significant reduction in tumor formation in a melanoma xenograft model.Collectively, these results describe an unanticipated role of MITF in the regulation of intimately linked NER and transcription machineries in the melanocytic lineage, which is preserved upon transformation into melanoma. Through its control of the NER/TFIIH complex MITF might coordinately regulate repair and transcription processes, thereby optimizing the rapid resumption of transcriptional activity after completion of strand repair, which is vitally important for cellular survival. The very same mechanism may drive the genesis of melanoma and its progression in the context of aberrant transcriptional activity of MITF due to SUMOylation defective germline mutation or genomic amplification.']",

Reported resistance mechanisms include acquisition of NRAS mutations, PDGFR or IGF1R activation, Cot amplification, or truncated BRAF upregulation. We report here that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), neuregulin-1 (NRG1), and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) cause robust resistance in vitro to BRAF or MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines. NRAS mutant lines were similarly resistant to MEK inhibition in the presence of these growth factors. By contrast other mitogenic factors such as PDGF, EGF, NGF, BDNF, MSP, MDK, GRO, and IGF1 did not maintain cell viability or growth. HGF, NRG1 and FGF2 prevented growth arrest and cell death and in some cell lines maintained cells in progressive growth. In addition, HGF and NRG1 could prevent growth arrest after dual treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Western analysis revealed that HGF and NRG1 reactivated Erk signaling and activated S6RP and AKT phosphorylation. Combined pharmacological inhibition mTor signaling and Akt signaling was required to fully block growth factor-mediated proliferation. In addition, small molecule Met inhibitors and an anti-HGF antibody blocked HGF-mediated resistance, while lapatinib and an anti-NRG1 antibody blocked NRG1-mediated resistance. While combined Akt and mTor inhibition potently inhibited cell line growth independent of BRAF or MEK inhibition, lapatinib and Met inhibitors had minimal effect on growth, suggesting potential for less adverse events with receptor inhibitors. In vitro co-culture experiments revealed that primary cells present in normal skin can cause resistance, and we have identified growth factors produced by these cells that contribute to resistance. We are analyzing receptor activation (Met and Erbb3) and FGF2 expression in wildtype, NRAS, and BRAF mutant primary melanoma samples. In future experiments we plan to test clinical samples from patients treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors, and we hypothesize that HGF, NRG1, and FGF2 signaling is elevated in patients with poor initial responses or relapse to BRAF or MEK inhibitors.']",

Addiction of melanoma to the MAPK pathways led to the development of inhibitors targeting either mutant BRAF, such as Vemurafenib (PLX4032), or MEK. Melanoma treatment recently met a breakthrough with the clinical evaluation of Vemurafenib that demonstrated an unprecedented 80% response rate among patients with BRAF V600E melanomas treated with Vemurafenib, but rapidly limited by drug resistance, which still requires to be elucidated.The MAPK pathway regulates the expression of many genes which can mediate therapeutic response but also resistance, such as RhoGTPases. We analysed the mRNA expression of the RhoGTPases in two BRAF mutated melanoma cell lines, WM266-4 and A375, in response to inhibition of the MAPK pathway by PLX4032. We observed that the mRNA of RhoB was increased by PLX4032 treatment. This result was confirmed in many other BRAF mutated melanoma cell lines by inhibition of the MAPK pathway with BRAF inhibitors (PLX4032 or SB-590885) as well as MEK inhibitors (AZD6244 or AS703026). MEK inhibitors (AZD6244 or AS703026) upregulate RhoB in BRAF wild-type melanoma cells harbouring N-Ras, K-Ras or c-KIT mutation suggesting that inhibiting MAPK pathway is critical for RhoB expression modulation. It is noteworthy that this modulation is cell type dependent, while it was not found in BRAF mutated non-melanoma cells as colon carcinoma cells (Colo205 and RKO).To investigate the role of RhoB induction in cellular responses to BRAF and MEK inhibitors, the RhoB induction was suppressed using RNA interference. The cells treated with siRNA targeting RhoB, WM266-4 and A375 cells, were more sensitive to PLX4032 and AZD6244. Moreover the blockade of RhoB induction led to a significant increase of PLX4032-induced apoptosis as shown by the increase of the subG1 population and PARP cleavage.Our findings show that RhoB upregulation is involved in PLX4032 response and both inhibitions of MAPK pathway and RhoB expression trigger cell death and should prompt a search for agents. Indeed co-targeting MAPK and RhoB pathways, could lead to a synthetic lethality and prevent resistance to either BRAF or MEK inhibitors.

Molecular targeted therapeutics against BRAF and MEK have shown marked efficacy for patients with metastatic melanoma. However these targeted therapies have a limited duration of response. Palbociclib is a highly selective inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) that has been shown to inhibit growth of malignant cell lines in vitro and in vivo by preventing the phosphorylation of Rb and stopping the progression G1/S of cell cycle. Cyclin D-CDK4/6-Rb axis has been shown to be dysregulated in 85-90% of melanomas and may represent a new therapeutic target. Our main goal in this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of palbociclib in a large panel of human melanoma cell lines to identify potential biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance. Material and Methods', ' We evaluated the response to palbociclib treatment in 48 melanoma cell lines. A comprehensive biomarker screen was performed using mutation and gene expression (Agilent) data. The mechanism of action of the drug was investigated by western blot (WB) analysis measuring phospho-Rb and senescence markers. Effects on the cell cycle and apoptosis were study by flow cytometry. Results', ' A marked differential response to palbociclib was observed across the melanoma cell lines with IC50s ranging from 28nM to over 1M. A subset (14/48) of cell lines were classified as sensitive at clinically achievable concentrations (IC50<150nM). BRAF and NRAS activating mutation did not correlate with sensitivity in vitro. Increased expression of genes correlating with cyclin D-CDK4/6 activation strongly predicted for palbociclib sensitivity. We also found that genomic and expression markers of activation of the hedgehog/smoothened (SHH) pathway strongly predicted for in vitro resistance to palbociclib. These markers included chromosomal amplification of SHH, and high baseline expression of SMO and GLI2. Protein analysis by WB showed a dramatic decrease in phospho-Rb protein only in sensitive cell lines and also it caused a decrease in FOXM1 protein, indicating palbociclib may partially act by inducing senescence in treated cells. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that palbociclib induces a strong G1/S arrest, but not significant apoptosis. Conclusion', ' Nearly 30% of the melanoma cell lines evaluated were found to be sensitive to palbociclib in vitro. Response to palbociclib did not correlate with BRAF and NRAS mutational status. A gene expression signature for CDK 4/6 activation successfully identified those cell lines most sensitive to palbociclib.

A substitution of an aspartate for a valine at position 816 (D816V) is one of the most commonly found oncogenic c-Kit mutation and is found in more than 90% of cases of mastocytosis and in a subgroup of germ cell tumors, core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia and mucosal melanomas. Previous studies have shown that the D816V mutation causes a structural change in the activation loop resulting in weaker binding of the activation loop to the juxtamembrane domain, leading to a release of the negative constraint it poses on kinase activity. Here we have investigated the role of Y823 in the activation loop of c-Kit and its role in oncogenic transformation by c-Kit/D816V. Although dispensable for the kinase activity of c-Kit/D816V, the presence of Y823 was shown to be crucial for cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, mutation of Y823 selectively down-regulated the Ras/Erk and Akt pathways. It also led to decreased phosphorylation of STAT5 and reduced the transforming capacity of D816V/c-Kit in vitro. The sensitivity to kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib and nilotinib, was decreased in cells expressing c-Kit/Y823F/D816V compared to cells c-Kit/D816V. Mice injected with cells expressing c-Kit/D816V/Y823F displayed significantly reduced tumor size as well as tumor weight compared to controls. Finally, microarray array analysis, comparing c-Kit/Y823F/D816V cells with cells expressing c-Kit/D816V, demonstrate that mutation of Y823 causes up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes whereas genes of survival pathways are down-regulated.

Our most potent inhibitor, 483-LM, was screened across a panel of human melanoma cell lines using a cell proliferation assay and revealed varying levels of sensitivity. A BH3 profiling assay demonstrates that C8161, the cell line most sensitive to our inhibitor, solely relies on Mcl-1 for survival. The Mcl-1 dependence of C8161 might contribute to the known metastatic nature of this cell line. Mechanistic studies revealed that 483-LM effectively engaged the endogenous Mcl-1 protein after treatment of C8161, as determined by a CETSA assay, and prompted disruption of protein-protein interactions between Mcl-1 and several pro-apoptotic proteins, including Bax, Bak and Bim. This was followed by induction of Bax/Bak dependent apoptosis and activation of hallmarks of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, including mitochondrial outer membrane depolarization, caspase activation, and PARP cleavage. Importantly, treatment with 483-LM caused massive up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Noxa, an effect apparent after an 8 hour treatment, which contributes to the induction of cell death. The in vivo efficacy studies with 483-LM showed significant effect on tumor growth and caspase-3 activation in tumor samples. Overall, our data indicate that Mcl-1 inhibitors are a promising treatment option for aggressive metastatic melanoma and warrant further preclinical investigation of 483-LM as a promising selective Mcl-1 inhibitor to be used as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and immunotherapy.']",

Birinapant (TL32711) is a bivalent Smac Mimetic that antagonizes multiple IAPs to promote efficient apoptosis and is currently in clinical trials as a single agent and in combination with multiple chemotherapeutics. However, to enrich for patient populations that will maximally benefit from each specific treatment regimen, it is critical to identify predictive biomarkers to achieve maximum response. Based on multiple individual studies, members of IAPs have been reported to be overexpressed in multiple cancers. Therefore, the main focus of this study was to evaluate DNA copy number alterations of different IAPs in a variety of cancer cell lines, and to evaluate their association with birinapant sensitivity. Our initial analysis of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database revealed that approximately 41% (397/972) of the cancer cell lines carried DNA amplification of different IAPs. Detailed analysis showed copy number amplification of ML-IAP in 214 cell lines (22%), cIAP1/2 in 85 cell lines (9%), NAIP (BIRC1) in 37 cell lines (4%), BIRC8 (ILP-2) in 39 cell lines (4%) and XIAP in 22 cell lines (2%). Tumor-type evaluation indicated that 50% pancreatic, 25% melanoma, 35% colorectal, 40% ovarian, and 7% AML cancer cell lines carried DNA amplification of different IAPs, indicating that IAPs are frequently amplified in cell lines of various cancer types. To understand the association of IAP amplification and birinapant sensitivity, we analyzed 94 cell lines present in the CCLE for birinapant sensitivity with or without TNF, and with or without TRAIL. Our analyses indicated that approximately 20% (19/94) of cancer cell lines were birinapant single-agent sensitive, and 80% (75/94) were single resistant cell lines. Furthermore, 50% (37/75) of the birinapant single resistant cell lines showed synergistic induction of apoptosis when birinapant was combined with either TNF or TRAIL (\"synergy-positive\"). Our analysis showed that the frequency of cIAP1/2 amplification in birinapant single-agent sensitive cell lines was 3-fold higher (4/19, 21%) than in single-agent resistant cancer cell lines (5/75, 7%). However, there was no difference in IAP gene amplification between birinapant \"synergy-positive\" and \"synergy-negative\" resistant cell lines. This lack of correlation with the synergistic response observed with the combination of birinapant plus either TNF or TRAIL implies the involvement of additional pathways that we are attempting to define. We will present a comprehensive dataset for the role of IAP gene amplification in birinapant tumor sensitivity.']",

The goal of this study is to examine whether rare germline sequence variants and/or copy number variations (CNVs) in these genes may influence melanoma risk in melanoma-prone families without known CDKN2A/CDK4 mutations. Methods', \" We conducted exome sequencing in blood-derived DNA in 75 melanoma cases from 23 American melanoma families with 3 affected members.

We also screened CNVs in these genes using data from the Nimblegen 3x720k exon-focused CGH tiling arrays, in which blood-derived DNA from 79 melanoma cases and 25 spouses were analyzed in the same mutation-negative families. We used the Nexus Copy Number built-in FASST2 algorithm to identify significant CNVs (significant threshold=0.000001; minimal number of probes per segment=5; log2 ratio>0.3 for gains and -0.3 for losses).

It has been identified as an oncogenic driver in various malignancies and is currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic target. To date, MET exon 14 skipping by sequencing and MET amplification by FISH have been found to have potential clinical utility in predicting those patients who may derive benefit from MET-targeted therapy. However, little research has been conducted on alternative technologies to FISH such as CISH, which does not require a dark room and can be interpreted by a board-certified pathologist. The purpose of this study is to report our experience with MET amplification across solid tumors using CISH.A retrospective analysis was done on 26,619 specimens analyzed for MET amplification by CISH at a CLIA-certified lab (Caris Life Sciences). The validated CISH assay, previously validated against a FISH assay, utilized a gene copy number > 5 to assess amplification. Concordance and correlative studies were done in MET-amplified, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens analyzed using a cMET IHC (SP44, 2+ or 3+ staining intensity in 50% or more tumor cell membrane) analyzing protein expression. Correlative studies involving co-existing aberrations, including PD-L1 (SP142, any intensity in at least 50% of tumor cells), in this MET-amplified, NSCLC cohort were also performed.MET amplification utilizing CISH was 0.7% (188/26,619) overall. MET-amplified solid tumors included carcinomas such as NSCLC (3.1%, 87/2767), gastric adenocarcinoma (3.8%, 11/293), esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (3.3%, 11/338), and endometrial carcinoma (0.4%, 9/2020) along with non-carcinomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (1.0%, 5/510), uterine sarcoma (1.3%, 5/400), melanoma (0.4%, 2/538), and rare tumors such as placental-site trophoblastic tumor (100%, 1/1) and prostatic neuroendocrine tumor (100%, 1/1). A sub-analysis of MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens demonstrated co-occurring protein overexpression in 92.6% (75/81) of cases. These same MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens were found to have EGFR pathogenic/presumed pathogenic mutations (19.7%, 15/76), ALK rearrangements (2.5%, 2/80), and PD-L1 overexpression (27.5%, 14/51). ROS1 rearrangements were not detected in this NSCLC cohort (0%, 0/76).Our data suggest MET amplification detection utilizing CISH is a viable option for identifying MET-driven cancers. The presence of MET across various solid tumors contrasts with biomarkers like HER2, which are exclusive to carcinomas. A sub-analysis of our NSCLC population shows MET-amplified tumors contains a similar molecular distribution to the general NSCLC population. Future studies should incorporate MET CISH in clinical trials utilizing MET-targeted agents to determine its potential as a predictive test for evaluating who may derive the most benefit.']",

        "Background":"['Epigenetic changes in cancer are thought to contribute to regulation of invasion and metastasis. To study this at a genome-wide level in melanoma we analyzed the methylome of 44 cases of malignant melanoma with the HELP (HpaII tiny fragment enriched by LM-PCR) assay and compared it to melanocyte controls. We saw widespread demethylation in melanoma occurring preferentially outside of CpG islands. Comparison of primary and metastatic lesions demonstrated that demethylation occurs early during carcinogenesis with few additional alterations in advanced tumors. Parallel transcriptomic analysis revealed many known and novel oncogenic pathways aberrantly expressed and regulated by loss of DNA methylation.The colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) was aberrantly expressed and hypomethylated in nearly all cases. The expression of CSF1R was validated by immunohistochemistry on primary tumors and by Western blotting in BRAF V600E mutant and WT melanoma cell lines. Expression of its ligand IL34, but not of CSF1 was also shown in the melanoma cells by both ELISA and qPCR. The effects of a small molecule inhibitor, PLX3397 as well as shRNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor were investigated in traditional and 3D cell culture. We saw inhibition of cell growth, smaller colony size, increased apoptosis and decreased invasiveness - suggesting a functional role for CSF1R in melanoma.Treatment of melanoma with small molecule inhibitors of BRAF V600E is effective for a time, but resistance invariably develops. The feedback activation of EGFR, BRAF amplification, BRAF splice variants and others are known to aid in the acquisition of resistance and lead to rebound activation of the MAPK-pathway. In Western blotting experiments, the rebound of ERK phosphorylation after BRAF inhibitor treatment was accelerated with the addition of the CSF1R ligands CSF1 and IL34, or delayed with PLX3397, also attenuating AKT phosphorylation. Melanoma cells stably expressing CSF1R shRNA recapitulated the effects of the inhibitor. Assaying the cells at different time points during a long-term V600E inhibitory experiment, we saw increasing levels of the transcription factor RUNX1, followed by increasing levels of IL34 and of the CSF1R protein, as well as its maturation, evidenced by the appearance of the high MW form. Utilizing shRNA-mediated knockdown of RUNX1 resulted in lower levels of the CSF1R and IL34 transcripts and delayed the rebound. Analysis of primary RNA-Seq data showed an increase in RUNX1, CSF1R and IL34 expression as resistance was acquired. Co-inhibition of CSF1R and BRAF was also tested and resulted in synergistic blockade of cell growth in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo. The CSF1R inhibitor, PLX3397, is in clinical trials for breast and other cancers, and these data present a preclinical rationale for its study in malignant melanoma.']",

Lipophilic statins (e.g. Atorvastatin, Simvastatin) induce strong caspase 3 activation after 48h of treatment, whereas hydrophilic statins (e.g. Pravastatin, Rosuvastatin) do not trigger caspase activation. Recently, we demonstrated the presence of an autocrine amplification loop which increases apoptosis by a caspase 8 dependent pathway after treatment with lipophilic statins (Minichsdorfer and Hohenegger, Br J Ph 2009). It is known that activation of caspase 2 may prime melanoma cells for death receptor induced apoptosis, however, although an association between caspase 2 activation and RhoB upregulation was shown, the significance of this interaction is still not clear.Methods', ' We investigated the activity of caspase 2, 3 and 8 in A375 and 518A2 human metastatic melanoma cells after statin treatment in the presence and absence of a caspase 2 inhibitor (Z-VDVAD-FMK) or cycloheximide by cleavage of specific fluorescent caspase substrates. Upregulation of RhoB after statin treatment as well as the influence of the co-treatment with the isoprenoids farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) was studied by Western blot.Results', ' Exposure of these cells to simvastatin led to increased caspase 2 activation which is abrogated by co-application of the caspase 2 inhibitor Z-VDVAD-FMK. Moreover, treatment with Z-VDVAD-FMK also prevented caspase 8 and caspase 3 activation. We could show that production of an autocrine factor needs an intact translation machinery. Inhibition of translation by co-administration of cycloheximide prevented apoptotic morphological changes as well as caspase 3 and caspase 8 activation in A375 and 518A2 cells. Since caspase 2 may interact with RhoB, we also investigated the effect of statin treatment on RhoB expression and observed an upregulation of RhoB which was inhibited by the addition of cycloheximide in both cell lines. However, isoprenoids were not able to reverse RhoB upregulation or PARP cleavage in 518A2 cells.Conclusion', ' Overall, our data provide evidence for an important role of caspase 2 in statin induced apoptosis of 2 human metastatic melanoma cell lines. These findings may help to understand the function of caspase 2 in the induction of apoptosis. Moreover, we observed upregulation of RhoB following statin treatment in these cell lines.

However, targeted therapies are associated with limited response durations and only a fraction of patients benefit from immunotherapies. The analysis of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) provides a powerful tool for the continuous assessment of treatment responses in melanoma patients.We have established a robust pipeline for the serial, prospective analysis of ctDNA in melanoma patients. By combining next generation sequencing (NGS)- and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)-based approaches we make ideal use of currently available technologies. To date, plasma samples from over 120 individuals have been collected, with follow-up times surpassing one year in many cases.For routine monitoring of patients commencing BRAF-mutant targeted therapies, pre-treatment DNA, derived from tumour biopsy or plasma, is tested to confirm the exact BRAF mutation and rule out pre-existing resistance-associated mutations using a custom NGS sequencing panel. Timely follow-up throughout treatment is achieved by measuring mutant BRAF fractions in ctDNA using ddPCR. When increasing BRAF variant allele frequencies are detected, additional ddPCR-based profiling for NRAS mutations and NGS-based re-sequencing for other resistance-associated mutations is initiated. We demonstrate superiority of ctDNA monitoring over LDH measurements and present a strategy to detect emerging resistant disease ahead of clinical scans in a cost-effective, timesaving and low technology way.In addition to the basic characterization of BRAF-mutant cases undergoing targeted therapy, we have used the analysis of ctDNA to uncover clonally distinct tumour sub-populations resulting in complex responses to treatment. For instance, we monitored a case of metastatic vaginal mucosal melanoma undergoing sequential targeted, immuno- and chemotherapy. Despite the presence of a KIT mutation in the primary tumour, response to KIT inhibitor imatinib was mixed. In the absence of tumour biopsies, we used whole exome-wide NGS of ctDNA to study the underlying mechanisms. This strategy revealed a KIT-mutant tumour sub-clone that responded to imatinib and a second sub-clone including an SF3B1 mutation that did not respond. The sub-clones also responded differentially to immunotherapies, but both responded to chemotherapy.The analysis of ctDNA is a powerful approach to monitor responses to systemic therapies in melanoma. By providing early warning of resistance and crucial information of clonal composition/evolution of the disease, ctDNA analysis has the potential to revolutionize the implementation of precision medicine.']",

Bcl-2 gene amplification occurs in 90% of cutaneous melanomas implicating it as a potential target. PNT100 is a 24-mer unmodified DNA oligonucleotide complementary to a non-coding region of bcl-2. PNT2258, is comprised of PNT100 encapsulated in a unique pH tunable nuclear-targeted liposomes termed SMARTICLES. Preliminary studies demonstrated fluorescently-labeled PNT100 in a SMARTICLE is delivered to the cell nucleus and that PNT2258 produces dramatic tumor regression in a diffuse large cell lymphoma xenograft, prolonging survival with a coincident decrease in bcl-2 protein. PNT2258 activity in the A375 melanoma model was assessed as a single agent or in combination in two separate studies. Study 1', ' PNT2258 alone, IV, 5 days/week for 3 weeks, to mice bearing A375 produced growth delays of 10.4, 7.8, and 7.8 days at 12.5, 8.3, and 5.6 mg/kg/dose, respectively. Docetaxel alone, IV weekly x3, produced growth delays of 19.4 (1/10 TFS), 14.8 (1/10 TFS), and 11.5 days at 30, 20, and 13.3mg/kg/dose. Combination therapy produced growth delays of 45.3 (5/10 TFS), 18.9, 28.1 (2/10 TFS), and 25.0 (3/10 TFS) days at 12.5+30, 12.5+20, 5.6+30, and 5.6+20 mg/kg/dose, respectively. Study 2', ' PNT2258 alone produced a growth delay of 12 days at 15mg/kg/dose. Dacarbazine alone was ineffective at 80 mg/kg/dose IP. Combination therapy was not superior to PNT2258 alone. In contrast, vemurafenib alone (37.5 mg/kg/dose, PO, BIDx18 days) was highly active producing a growth delay in excess of 30 days, as did the combination of PNT2258+vemurafenib. PNT2258 is currently being evaluated for safety and tolerability in a phase Ia clinical trial. Preliminary mouse and human pharmacokinetics suggest that exposure levels in humans are similar to those producing anti-tumor efficacy in mice. Overall, 1) PNT2258+docetaxel produced a greater than additive effect compared to single agents, 2) PNT2258+dacarbazine was not superior to PNT2258 alone, 3) PNT2258+vemurafenib while highly active, was not superior to vemurafinib therapy alone, and 4) therapeutic PNT2258 exposures have been attained in patients.']",

To identify cancer populations that most likely to respond to BYL719 treatment, we initiated a comprehensive in vitro pharmacologic profiling screen across a large panel of cancer cell lines that have been previously characterized at the molecular level as part of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) effort. We found that BYL719 responsive cell lines are enriched in indications such as Her2 positive and luminal breast cancer, while lacking in other indications such as Glioblastoma and Melanoma. Further exploration of the underlying genetic and pathway aberrations revealed that BYL719 sensitivity is positively associated with PIK3CA mutation, ERBB2 amplification and PIK3CA amplification/copy number gain. PTEN and BRAF mutations on the other hand, are associated with BYL719 insensitivities.

        "Background":"['Uveal melanoma (UM) is an aggressive intraocular malignancy with high tendency to metastasize to the liver. The majority of UM harbor activating mutations in the G proteins Gnaq/11, and amplification of the oncogene c-Myc. Currently available drugs have shown limited response in patients with UM and there is an urgent need for new effective therapies. Recent findings from our laboratory demonstrated that UM cells with Gnaq/11 mutations are dependent on BRD4 activity. BET proteins are epigenetic readers involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. BRD4 inhibitors consist of small molecules that competitively displace BRD4 from acetylated histones, resulting in the suppression of the MYC transcriptome and other BRD4-dependent genes. Here, we report that a novel clinical BRD4 inhibitor from Plexxikon (Berkeley, CA), PLX51107, induces high cytotoxic activity in UM cell lines at nanomolar concentrations. In cells with Gnaq/11 mutations, PLX51107 showed an IC50 of 250nM, similar to the pre-clinical compound JQ1. In contrast, PLX51107 did not have a significant effect (IC50>3000nM) in cells without the mutations. PLX51107 induced marked apoptosis in Gnaq/11 mutant cells, as detected by Annexin V staining and induction of cleaved PARP. It also suppressed the expression of BRD4 targets, i.e c-Myc, Rad51, and induced the pro-apoptotic protein Bim. In mouse xenograft models of UM PLX51107 significantly inhibited tumor growth. Since the MAPK pathway plays a major role in UM, we explored the combination of PLX51107 with a MEK inhibitor, and found increased activity in vitro and in vivo. All together, these observations support the idea that this clinical BRD4 inhibitor represents a novel therapeutic intervention against UM with Gnaq/11 mutations, and clinical development is planned.']",

However, the inter and intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity for BRAF status has been described supporting the need for testing multiple sites for the same patient.

The objective of our work was to determine the potential of plasma DNA to detect BRAF mutations, particularly in patients presenting discordant BRAF status from different tumor sites.  Methods', '  Plasma DNA was extracted using the iPrep PureLink Virus Kit on an iPrep purification system (Invitrogen). BRAF mutations were detected using the Therascreen BRAF RGQ kit (Qiagen).  Results', '  Ninety-nine patients were included, and plasma was collected at baseline. Nine stage III melanoma patients presenting a mutant BRAF (6 V600E, 2 V600K and 1 V600D) were tested and for 4 of them we detected the corresponding mutation (including the V600D and both V600K) in circulating DNA (sensitivity 44.4 %). Similarly, 20 stage IV patients were tested (17 V600E, 2 V600K and 1 V600R). The corresponding mutation (including the V600R and both V600K) was detected in 15 of these patients (sensitivity 75.0%). Interestingly, 4 stage IV patients included in our series presented discordant BRAF mutation status on different sites (1 patient with a WT primary tumor (PT) and a V600E lymph node (LN) metastasis; 1 patient with a V600E PT and WT LN metastasis; 2 patients with a V600E PT, V600E LN and WT liver metastasis). We were able to detect the expected BRAF mutation in circulating DNA for all these patients.  Conclusions', '  The sensitivity of our procedure, based on approved kits, suggests a high interest for use in clinical practice, even for non-V600E mutations. Plasma DNA might be less sensitive to heterogeneity between tumor samples, and therefore might represent an interesting alternative source of DNA to detect BRAF mutations in clinical setting.']",

        "Background":"['Epigenetic changes in cancer are thought to contribute to regulation of invasion and metastasis. To study this at a genome-wide level in melanoma we analyzed the methylome of 44 cases of malignant melanoma. We saw widespread demethylation in melanoma occurring preferentially outside of CpG islands. Comparison of primary and metastatic lesions showed demethylation occurs early during carcinogenesis with few additional alterations in advanced tumors. The colony stimulating factor-1 receptor was aberrantly expressed and hypomethylated in nearly all cases. The expression of CSF1R was validated by IHC on primary tumors and by qPCR and Western blotting in BRAF mutant and WT cell lines. CSF1R can be aberrantly expressed via an upstream LTR element in Hodgkin’s lymphoma. After analyzing our patient samples and the cell lines, we have found this aberrant transcript may be the dominant form in melanoma as well. Expression of one of its ligands IL34 was also shown in the cell lines by both ELISA and qPCR pointing to a potential autocrine regulatory loop. The effects of a small molecule inhibitor, PLX3397 as well as shRNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor were investigated in 2D and 3D cell culture. We saw inhibition of cell growth, smaller colony size, increased apoptosis and decreased invasiveness - suggesting a functional role for CSF1R in melanoma. Treatment of melanoma with small molecule inhibitors of BRAF V600E is effective for a time, but resistance invariably develops. The feedback activation of EGFR, BRAF amplification, BRAF splice variants and others are known to aid in the acquisition of resistance and the rebound activation of the MAPK-pathway. We are suggesting a role for CSF1R in this process. In Western experiments, the rebound of phospho-ERK after BRAF inhibitor treatment was accelerated with the addition of CSF1R ligands, or delayed with PLX3397, also attenuating AKT phosphorylation. Melanoma cells stably expressing shRNA against CSF1R recapitulated the effects of the inhibitor. Assaying the cells at different time points during a long-term V600E inhibitory experiment, we saw increasing levels of the transcription factor RUNX1, followed by increasing levels of IL34 and of the receptor, as well as its maturation, evidenced by the appearance of the high MW form. Utilizing shRNA-mediated knockdown of RUNX1 resulted in lower levels of the CSF1R and IL34 transcripts and delayed the rebound. Analysis of primary RNA-Seq data showed an increase in RUNX1, CSF1R and IL34 expression in resistant tumors. Co-inhibition of CSF1R and BRAF was also tested and resulted in synergistic blockade of cell growth in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo. The CSF1R inhibitor, PLX3397 is currently in clinical trials for glioblastoma, prostate, breast cancers and other cancers. These data present a preclinical rationale for its study in malignant melanoma.']",

Activation can be the result of largely mutually exclusive somatic mutations of KIT, NRAS, or more frequently, BRAF(V600E). The FDA and EMA approval of a BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) that blocks the function of the BRAFV600E protein established a new paradigm for targeted drug development. Currently, BRAF inhibitors are one of the most promising approaches to treat metastatic melanoma.Methods', ' In this study, we applied mass spectrometry-based SNP genotyping (Sequenom) to detect single nucleotide mutations in 33 cancer-related genes including BRAF, NRAS, KIT, CTNNB1, GNAS, and MET. PCR and extension primers for the multiplexed assay were designed with the Sequenom Assay Design software. Samples were processed as recommended by the manufacturer. Matrix chips were assayed on a Sequenom MassArray MALDI-TOF Mass Array system. Visual inspection and Sequenom Typer software were used to perform genotyping based on mass spectra. We compared two independent melanoma cohorts, one from Ireland (SVUH cohort; n=97) and the other from Belgium (Leuven cohort; n=60).Results', ' Intriguingly, patients from Ireland showed significant lower BRAFV600E mutation rates (19.0%) when compared to the mutation frequency seen with the Belgian cohort (43.3%) or with the mutation frequency reported by other studies on non-Irish populations (50-70%). In addition, BRAFV600K mutation is rare in the SVUH cohort (1.0%) compared with the Leuven cohort (6.7%). Mutations in BRAFV600M and V600R were <2% in both groups. Although the number of NRASQ61 mutant cases was slightly higher among the Irish melanoma patients compared with Belgium patients (20.6% and 13.3%, respectively), this does not fully account for the difference in BRAFV600E mutation rate. In contrast, many BRAFV600 WT patients in the SVUH cohort carried significantly increased mutation rates in MET (11.4%) compared to the Leuven cohort (0%) and reported elsewhere (2%). c-MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that activates multiple signal transduction pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, WNT, and Notch. MET inhibitors that are currently in clinical trials include cabozantinib and foretinib and might be a valuable alternative treatment strategy for patients exhibiting this mutation. Mutation rates of the other examined genes were always <5% and did not significantly differ between the groups.Conclusion', ' Our observation of reduced BRAFV600E mutation rates in Irish patients will directly impact future treatment strategies for these patients.

The detection of CTCs has gained increasing interest for prediction of clinical outcome. However, it remains to be determined whether uveal melanoma cells circulating in a peripheral vein predict systemic recurrence and poorer overall prognosis.Uveal melanoma, the most common primary cancer of the eye in adults, is unique in that the uveal tract is devoid of lymphatics. Since systemic recurrence develops exclusively via hematogenous spread, patients with uveal melanomas present a special opportunity to explore the prognostic potential of CTCs. Although the lung is the first organ through which venous drainage from the affected eye passes and indeed the only organ through which all venous blood must pass, 80-95% of systemic metastases are found first in the liver without development of lung metastases. To address these issues, we investigated the numbers of CTCs in paired arterial (femoral) and venous (antecubital) blood specimens obtained from uveal melanoma patients with hepatic metastases.Methods', ' CTCs in blood specimens were measured in 17 uveal melanoma patients with multiple hepatic metastases, including 10 patients with liver-only metastases and 7 patients with hepatic and extra-hepatic metastases. Peripheral arterial and venous blood specimens were collected at the same time prior to liver directed treatment. CTCs were analyzed using CellTracks Circulating melanoma Cell Kit by CellSearch System. The clinical information and sources of blood specimens were blinded when CTCs were analyzed.Result', ' CTCs were detectable from all 17 arterial blood specimens (100%) (median 5, range 1 to 168). In contrast, much smaller numbers of CTCs were detectable in 52.9% (9/17) of venous blood specimens (median 1, range 0 to 8) from the same patients. In terms of degree of tumor burden, patients who have hepatic as well as extra-hepatic metastasis showed higher numbers of arterial CTCs (median 12, range 5 to 168), compared to patients who have liver-only metastasis (median 4, range 1 to 11). More importantly, there is no significant correlation between numbers of arterial CTCs and the degree of tumor volume in the liver in patients who have liver-only metastases.Conclusions', ' Using this technology, the detection of uveal melanoma cells in peripheral blood is feasible. Peripheral capillary beds effectively filter CTCs from venous blood; thus venous blood might not be the best source for measurement of CTCs in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. The paucity of clinically evident non-hepatic metastases despite the effective filtration by peripheral capillary beds remains unexplained and may be a demonstration of the seed and soil hypothesis. CTCs are a non-invasive source of uveal melanoma cells for evaluating tumor biology. Further investigation is warranted.']",

At least 3 serially-collected plasma samples were available for each patient, corresponding to pre-treatment, best treatment response, and progression of disease as evidenced by PET/CT scan. DNA was extracted from plasma samples and concentrations were measured using a Qubit fluorometer. The relevant BRAF region was assayed using 24 to a maximum of 337 ng of DNA from each sample, using multiple replicate wells for dilute samples to maximize the probability of detecting BRAF mutant copies. Specific Taqman 5 hydrolysis probes for wild-type and mutant BRAF were employed along with common primers to measure the number of copies of each amplicon/reaction.

In vivo studies in Balb SCID mice were performed to assess the suppression of BRAF-mutant xenografts on treatment with BI847325.RESULTS', ' BI847325 potently reduced the growth and survival of BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines with acquired and intrinsic BRAF inhibitor resistance (NRAS mutations, BRAF splice forms, Cyclin D1 amplification, RTK upregulation, PTEN loss, COT amplification). We confirmed that BI847325 induced apoptosis through decrease in Mcl-1 mRNA and protein expression and increase in BIM expression. The effects of BI847325 upon BIM and Mcl-1 expression could not be mimicked by the combination of other MEK and aurora kinase inhibitors. For the first time we demonstrated that BI847325 reverses the acquired vemurafenib resistance by inhibiting MEK expression at mRNA and protein level. A strong suppression of MEK expression was observed without recovery following 72 h of washout. In vivo studies revealed complete tumor suppression with no recurrence over a period of 65 days of treatment with 70mg/kg/week dose of BI847325. In contrast, treatment with vemurafenib analog PLX4720 in the same mouse model was associated with tumor relapse after 30 days of treatment. BI847325 also successfully suppressed the long-term growth of xenografts with acquired vemurafenib resistance. Analysis of tumor samples complied with in vitro results demonstrating inhibition of phospho-ERK, phospho-Histone3, Mcl-1 and total MEK.CONCLUSION', ' In conclusion we report for the first time that BI847325, a novel ATP-competitive MEK/ Aurora kinase inhibitor effectively inhibits BRAF-mutant melanoma and overcomes vemurafenib-resistance by decreasing expression of MEK and Mcl-1; in vitro and in vivo. Further preclinical and clinical investigations towards this would open new avenues in treatment of melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['The fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) play a key role during development and in adult function. FGFRs belong to a family of receptor tyrosine kinases which are single-pass transmembrane receptors with extracellular ligand binding domains and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Upon binding of the ligand the kinase domain activates intracellular signaling networks that coordinate cellular processes such as proliferation, growth, differentiation, migration and survival. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are a family of 18 ligands which are able to bind and activate distinct FGFRs. Deregulated FGFR activity, through mutations or translocations, is often associated with oncogenic events. Overexpression of FGFR or FGF may lead to increased cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, migration or survival, thus making it an interesting target.In this study we optimized a TaqMan qRT-PCR-based approach to evaluate the copy number variation for several FGFRs (FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4) and several FGF ligands (FGF1, FGF2, FGF3, FGF4, FGF10, FGF12, and FGF19) on a panel of 23 cell lines. The cell types covered a variety of diseases including bladder, breast, endometrial, gastric, kidney, liver, lymphoma, melanoma, sarcoma, small cell lung carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. These cell lines had been tested for sensitivity to the JNJ FGFR small molecule inhibitor JNJ42541707 which is a pan-FGFR inhibitor. We observed in the sensitive (IC50<100nm) and moderately sensitive (IC50 100 nM - 1000 nM) cell lines a co-amplification of FGF receptor and ligand. Two of the most sensitive cell lines to FGFR inhibitor treatments had the greatest amplification of FGFR2 with a copy number value greater than 100. This finding that co-amplification occurs in receptor and ligand offers a new potential biomarker for patients that may be sensitive to small molecule FGFR inhibitors.']",

Detection of these genetic alterations in circulating DNA has potential clinical applications. We investigated the relationship between mutant BRAF in plasma DNA and treatment response.  Methods', '  DNA was extracted from plasma using the iPrep PureLink Virus Kit on an iPrep purification system (Invitrogen). BRAF mutations were detected using the Therascreen BRAF RGQ kit (Qiagen).  Results', '  Seventeen patients (1 stage IIIC and 16 stage IV) with a mutated BRAF melanoma (V600E in all cases) were included.

Twelve patients were treated with a BRAF inhibitor, 4 with a combination of a BRAF inhibitor and a MEK inhibitor, and one patient was treated with chemotherapy (DTIC). After 3 months of melanoma treatment, the BRAF V600 mutation was detected in the plasma of 9 patients (9/17; 53,9%). The presence of mutant BRAF in plasma DNA was compared to the clinical response of patients. The BRAF mutation was present in the plasma of 6 out of the 7 patients who did not respond to treatment.
