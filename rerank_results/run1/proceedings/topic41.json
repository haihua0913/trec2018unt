Among the different cell lines tested we have been able to highlight that the KM12 human colorectal carcinoma present hypersensitivity to inhibition. By intersecting the results of activity of the compound and the bibliographic data, we could confirm that the activity of the compound was mediated by the inhibition of phosphorylation of the receptor NTRK1.The NTRK1 gene encodes Tropomyosin-related kinase A (TRKA), the hight-affinity Nerve Growth Factor Receptor. NTRK1 was originally isolated from a human colon carcinoma as a transforming oncogene activated by a somatic rearrangement that fused TPM3 (non-muscle tropomyosin) gene to kinase domain of a novel tyrosine-kinase receptor. The KM12 human CRC cell line expresses the chimeric TPM3-TRKA protein and is hypersensitive to TRKA kinase inhibition.Using differential quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR and optimised immunohistochemistry we could confirm the existence of low frequency (0.5%) NTRK1 re-arranged / activated forms in colorectal carcinoma. A same colorectal tumor sample could contain different fusion transcripts, highlighting the molecular heterogeneity of this type of tumor Furthermore we detect a novel NTRK1 fusion in colorectal carcinoma clinical samples corresponding to oncogenic rearrangement TRK-T2 identified in papillary thyroid carcinoma.These results confirm the potential interest of the target NTRK1 in the panel of targeted therapies against colorectal cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of brain tumor, yet with no targeted therapy with substantial survival benefit. Recent studies on many types of solid tumors showed that fusion genes often play driver roles and are promising targets for pharmaceutical intervention. To survey potential fusion genes in GBM, we analysed RNA-Seq data from 162 GBM patients available through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). From the analysis, we identified recurrent fusion of neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 (NTRK1, also called TrkA) to the genes highly expressed in neuronal tissues, neurofascin (NFASC) and brevican (BCAN). NTRK1 is a mediator of the pro-survival signaling of nerve growth factor (NGF) and is a known oncogene, found commonly altered in human cancer. While GBMs largely lack NTRK1 expression, the fusion-positive GBMs express fusion transcripts in high abundance that retain NTRK1 kinase domain in frame. Analyses of the matching Exome-Seq data indicated that NFASC-NTRK1 fusion occurred through DNA-level rearrangement, whereas BCAN-NTRK1 fusion presumably occurred at RNA-level. As analogous NTRK1-fusions with thyroid-expressed genes were previously shown to drive thyroid cancer, NTRK1-fusion in GBM might have a similar role. Consistent with this hypothesis, the GBMs that harbor the NTRK1-fusion showed elevated NGF/NTRK1 pathway activity. About 1% of GBM patients are estimated to have NTRK1-fusion; these patients might benefit from potential NTRK1 inhibition therapies.Citation Format', ' Jinkuk Kim, Hee-Jin Cho, Gye-Hyun Cho, Young-Hyeh Ko, Soonmyung Paik, Do-Hyun Nam.

        "Background":"['Background', '  Chromosomal rearrangements resulting in expression of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase fusions occur in a subset of epithelial malignancies and can underlie sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), rearrangements involving anaplastic lymphoid kinase (ALK), ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1), and RET proto-oncogene (RET) occur at frequencies of approximately 4%, 1% and 1%, respectively. Rearrangements involving neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 (NTRK1) have been described, though the frequency is not well characterized.  Methods', '  We implemented a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, Anchored Multiplex PCR (AMP), for detection of fusion transcripts using targeted next-generation sequencing of cDNA generated from clinical samples (Zheng et al., 2014). The sequencing library targets known fusion exons in ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK1. We retrospectively reviewed the NSCLC cases assessed by this method.  Results', '  Between July 2013 and January 2015, 663 clinical NSCLC cases from our institution were assessed, providing > 99% power to detect at least one fusion event at an underlying frequency as low as 1%. 584 cases were adenocarcinoma histology. We detected fusions involving ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK1 at frequencies of 2.6%, 0.9%, 2.0% and 0.0% (17, 6, 13 and 0 cases), respectively. All were mutually exclusive. The histologic subtype was adenocarcinoma in all fusion cases except one.

The ALK fusion partner in all cases was EML4; ROS1 fusion partners were SDC4, CD74, and EZR; and RET fusion partners were KIF5B, CCDC6, RUFY2 and TRIM24. Although no NTRK1 fusion was detected in NSCLC, we detected a PPL-NTRK1 fusion in a thyroid carcinoma.  Conclusions', '  With this method, we identified ALK, ROS1 and RET fusions at frequencies and with patient characteristics consistent with previous studies.

        "Background":"['In cancer, the formation of chimeric gene fusions by genomic rearrangement causes aberrant receptor tyrosine kinase activation resulting in sustained oncogenic signaling driving tumorigenesis. Neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase 1 (NTRK1), the cognate receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), has been reported in 7 tumor types as a NTRK1 kinase domain fused with several reported partners including the 5 coiled-coil domain of the tropomysin TPM3 gene. The resultant NTRK1 fusion protein is present in about 1.5% of colorectal cancer (CRC), 3% of lung and 12% of papillary thyroid cancers. In addition, gene fusions involving NTRK2 and NTRK3 are present in about 19 different tumor types. Thus pharmacologically targeting NTRK kinase in cancers bearing NTRK fusions may provide treatment options to patients who otherwise might be resistant to standard oncolytic regimens. Merestinib (LY2801653) is an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of several oncokinases, including MET, AXL, ROS1 and MKNK1/2. Merestinib and its two primary metabolites, M1 (LSN2800870) and M2 (LSN2887652) were shown in scanMaxSM kinase binding assays to inhibit all three NTRKs with an IC50 ranging from 15-320 nM, and in the cell-based PathHunter NTRK1 assay with an IC50 ranging from 12-92 nM. Merestinib, M1 and M2 were evaluated in vitro in TPM3-NTRK1 fusion bearing CRC cells (KM-12). Merestinib, M1 and M2 reduced p-NTRK1 levels, cell proliferation (IC50 of 11 nM, 18 nM and 100 nM respectively) and anchorage independent growth (IC50 of 45 nM, 79 nM and 206 nM respectively). Crizotinib previously reported (Nat Med. 2013;19', '1469-72) to have moderate activity against NTRK1, was used to treat a patient with NTRK1 fusion resulted with transient response. Crizotinib was shown here to also reduce p-NTRK1 levels, cell proliferation (IC50 = 88nM) and anchorage independent growth (IC50 = 276nM) in vitro in KM-12 cells. Merestinib treatment at 24 mg/kg once daily arrested tumor growth (T/C = 4%) in KM-12 xenograft tumor bearing mice. Crizotinib administered at 25 mg/kg twice daily in this same model did not result in tumor growth arrest (T/C = 39.5%). Merestinib treatment at 24 mg/kg once daily led to tumor regression in a CRC PDX xenograft model (EL1989) bearing the TPM3-NTRK1 fusion. Crizotinib treatment at 25 mg/kg twice daily in this model did not show tumor regression. Further pre-clinical studies of Merestinib inhibition of NTRK2 and NTRK3 gene fusion are ongoing. These data support the clinical evaluation of Merestinib in patients with tumors harboring NTRK fusion. Merestinib is currently being studied clinically in advanced cancers (NCT01285037).']",

Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an orally available, highly potent and selective ATP-competitive pan-Trk, ROS1 and ALK inhibitor. In preclinical studies, entrectinib effectively inhibits target kinase activity and cancer cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth across various fusion partners and cancer types. More importantly, entrectinib's activity has been validated clinically in patients across multiple fusion partners and tissue histologies.Trk inhibitors, including entrectinib, have shown promising clinical activity in molecularly selected patients. Predictably, potential resistance mechanisms have also begun to emerge. For example, mutations in the Trk kinase domain were identified as one of the in vitro induced resistance mechanisms to the Trk inhibitor, Loxo-101. The three reported resistance mutations in the Ba/F3-MPRIP-NTRK1 cell line model treated with Loxo-101 were F589, G667 and V573. The F589 location on TrkA is equivalent to the gatekeeper mutations, L1196 location on ALK and L2026 location on ROS1. These gatekeeper mutations often arise as resistance mechanisms in patients treated with ALK and ROS1 inhibitors. To test the activity of entrectinib against these three reported NTRK1 mutations, we introduced mutated Trk proteins into Ba/F3 and cancer cell lines and performed dose-dependent proliferation studies. Entrectinib was able to inhibit proliferation of cells harboring each of these three mutations that confer resistance to other Trk inhibitors. Particularly, the IC50 values of entrectinib against kinase domain wildtype and gatekeeper mutated (F589) are essentially unchanged (low single-digit nM), which is consistent with the observation that entrectinib is also able to inhibit the gatekeeper mutation in ALK (L1196) in both cell based assays and in vivo tumor growth inhibition studies.In conclusion, our preclinical data suggest that entrectinib is an effective treatment for patients with NTRK-rearranged tumors, including cancers that harbor certain resistance mutations to other Trk inhibitors.\"]",

Quality control was performed by extracting RNA and testing using the ArcherDx FusionPlex Lung Thyroid Panel and the Ion AmpliSeq RNA Fusion Lung Cancer Research Panel.Results', ' All twelve (12) fusions present in the prototype were detected as high confidence calls on the ArcherDx Lung Thyroid panel. Whereas embedded cell lines (with genomic mutations) give extremely high positive results (typical results are thousands of reads across the fusion junction), Seraseq FFPE Fusion RNA Reference material gave low positive results, similar to patient samples. The reads spanning the fusion junction ranged from 38 to 396. The Ion AmpliSeq RNA Fusion Lung Cancer panel assays only 6 of the fusions in the Seraseq reference material due to their assay design; however, all assayed fusions were appropriately detected.Conclusions', ' Highly multiplexed reference materials in FFPE format are needed for quality control of NGS-based detection of oncology RNA fusions. Seraseq FFPE RNA Fusion Reference Material allows simultaneous evaluation of detection for twelve fusions observed in a variety of solid tumors, both common and rare. It generates low positive results on two leading assays, and this is important to truly challenge the assay system and verify performance at levels expected for patient samples.']",

        "Background":"[\"The growing trend to make cancer treatment more precise depends on the accurate identification of clinically actionable genomic alterations within a patient's tumor. Fusion proteins that result from genomic rearrangements are attractive therapeutic targets because they are tumor-specific and cancer cells depend on their expression for survival. The goal of this study was to investigate the breadth of genomic rearrangements in 19 genes shown to be fused in at least one solid cancer across a collection of 5,917 tumors from a diverse variety of subtypes. All tumor samples were submitted to a CLIA-certified CAP-accredited laboratory (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge MA) for next-generation sequencing-based genomic profiling of 3,769 exons from 236 cancer related genes and 47 introns of 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. We observed 350 genomic rearrangements in 338 samples from 82 different solid tumor pathologies. Rearrangements involving kinases were observed in 176 samples (3% of total samples). We identified potentially druggable rearrangements of BRAF (n=13 unique partners; 9 pathologies), ALK (n=11 unique partners; 11 pathologies), FGFR2 (n=9 unique partners; 6 pathologies), ROS1 (n=7 unique partners ; 3 pathologies), RET (n=7 unique partners; 5 pathologies), FGFR3 (n=5 unique partners; 6 pathologies), NTRK1 (n=3 unique partners; 3 pathologies), ERBB2 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies), and ERBB3 (n=2 unique partners; 2 pathologies). ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK1 fusions in lung cancer have all shown sensitivity to targeted agents in patients. The largest number of genomic rearrangements (n=87) was found in lung adenocarcinoma (12% of cases). Interestingly, we identified a KIAA1549-BRAF fusion in a triple negative breast cancer sample, a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion in glioblastoma, a KIF5B-RET fusion in ovarian cancer, and an NCOA4-RET fusion in colon adenocarcinoma. These fusions have been identified previously in pilocytic astrocytoma, myeloid malignancies, lung cancer and thyroid cancer, respectively, but have rarely been reported outside of these diseases; importantly, hypereosinophilic syndromes harboring FIP1L1-PDGFRA are sensitive to imatinib, and lung cancers with KIF5B-RET are sensitive to cabozantinib. Collectively, these data demonstrate that gene fusions exist across a multitude of tumor types and that known fusions are not always confined to the disease in which they appear most often. These rearrangements include clinically actionable fusions which may identify tumors that are sensitive to selective FDA-approved targeted agents.\"]",

        "Background":"['All patients with oncogenic driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are treated with a targeted agent will eventually develop resistance. In an effort to identify inhibitors of NTRK1 and ROS1, which are inappropriately activated in NSCLC, we created and screened a library of existing targeted drugs against BaF3 cells transformed with these oncogenes. This screen identified the FDA-approved drug cabozantinib as a potent inhibitor of CD74-ROS1 (IC50 = 9 nM), including the crizotinib-resistant mutants G2032R (IC50 = 26 nM) and L2026M (IC50 = 11 nM), with no inhibition of the parental BaF3 cells (IC50 > 10 M). AP26113, a dual ALK/EGFR inhibitor undergoing phase I/II clinical trials, also potently inhibited CD74-ROS1 (IC50 = 4 nM), including the crizotinib-resistant mutants G2032R (IC50 = 206 nM) and L2026M (IC50 = 84 nM), with weak inhibition of the parental BaF3 cells (IC50 > 1 M). Both cabozantinib and AP26113 inhibited ROS1 autophosphorylation and downstream ERK activation in CD74-ROS transformed BaF3 cells and in the ROS1-rearranged NSCLC cell line HCC78. The FGFR3 inhibitor dovitinib, which is in phase III clinical trials for renal cell carcinoma, potently inhibited NTRK1 compared to parental BaF3 cells (IC50 = 69 nM vs > 1 M), and blocked NTRK1 autophosphorylation and ERK activation. While acquired resistance to targeted therapies is a major clinical problem, this study highlights other existing agents that may overcome resistance, and identifies several promising candidates for clinical trials.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Comprehensive genetic profiling of chromosomal translocations in lung cancer tumors",
        "Background":"['Approximately 7% of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) harbor oncogenic fusions involving ALK, ROS1, and RET. While tumors harboring ALK fusions are highly sensitive to crizotinib, emerging data have demonstrated that individuals with ROS1 or RET fusions may also benefit from inhibitors targeting these two kinases. A new oncogenic fusion involving NTRK1 that can be targeted by kinase inhibitors has been recently described. The two main methods to identify translocations, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) are labor intensive and sensitivity is rather low. Common sample types for lung cancer analysis are biopsies making the study of more than one fusion gene rather difficult. In this study we aimed to develop and validate a workflow based on AmpliSeq technology to comprehensively profile ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK1 chromosomal translocations in lung tumors. Two hundred lung cancer retrospective samples, including tumor biopsy, were collected from 12 laboratories - the OncoNetwork Consortium. All the samples were previously characterized by orthologous techniques (FISH, IHC, RT-PCR and/or MassArray). More than 30 ALK positive samples were selected. The panel targets over 70 fusion transcripts associated with ALK, RET, ROS1, and NTRK1 genes. The panel also includes 5 and 3 gene expression assays for each gene as indicators of a translocation event and assays for 5 internal control genes. The workflow is compatible with formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue, requiring only 10ng of total RNA and able to multiplex up to 16 libraries on a single Ion 318 chip. A dedicated data analysis pipeline using the Ion Reporter software 4.2 was evaluated. Serial dilutions of cell lines RNA harboring known fusion events, in normal RNA showed that the methodology had 1% mutant RNA limit of detection. A second dilution experiment using RNA extracted from FFPE lung fusion positive samples diluted in a negative FFPE sample showed a detection limit of 15%. The use of a common control fusion positive RNA samples among all the consortia laboratories showed 100% reproducibility. Concordance study was performed using 200 FFPE samples previously characterized with standard method. A concordance of >98% was obtained between the methodologies. The discordant results are currently under study. A negative FFPE samples was run as single test on an Ion 318 chip on to evaluate the possibility of false positive results due to high number of reads. No false positive was detected in this experiment. In this study we present a workflow that provides a robust, reproducible and accurate comprehensive genetic screening tool well suited for FFPE lung tumor biopsies, in a fast and cost-efficient manner. This may provide a valuable tool for reducing turn-around-time and expense in lung cancer analysis.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), strongly tobacco-associated, has been described to have a heavy mutation burden, harboring high rates of TP53 and RB1 alterations. While initially responsive to radiation and chemotherapy, SCLC is characterized by eventual progression and resistance to traditional therapy. We retrospectively analyzed a molecular profiling (MP) database to identify potentially actionable alterations using a multi-platform approach which includes massively parallel sequencing. Experimental Procedures', ' SCLC patient samples were referred to a central CLIA laboratory (Caris Life Sciences, AZ) for MP (immunohistochemistry [IHC] and next generation sequencing [NGS]). Expression of PD1 (MRQ-22, 1+) on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and PDL1 (130021, SP142, 2+5%) in tumor cells was performed by IHC. Additional IHC (ERCC1, TOPO1) and NGS on 591 genes was performed on FFPE samples using the Illumina NextSeq platform in a subset of patient samples. All variants were detected with > 99% confidence. Variants are described as follows', ' pathogenic, presumed pathogenic, variants of unknown significance and unclassified variants (excluding SNPs). Results', ' 203 SCLC samples were identified, 48% were females (97) and 52% were males (106). Median age was 65 [range', ' 29-88]. Cancer cells expressed PDL1 in 2.5% of cases (5/203) and PD1+ TILs were detected in 38% (75/197). For comparison, internal PDL1+ in non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) was 31% (339/1098). Notable findings from IHC included ERCC1 negative status in 93% (14/15) and TOPO1 + in 70% (14/20). CNV and mutational analysis (NGS) was available for 10 and 22 patients, respectively. Amplifications were found in the following genes', ' CCND3, CRKL, FGF4, FGFR1 and NFKB1A (n = 1, respectively), and CCND1, CCNE1, CDKN2A and FGF3 (n = 2, respectively). As previously reported, the most frequently altered genes were TP53 (73%) and RB1 (68%). Clinically relevant pathogenic or presumed pathogenic variants included', ' EGFR (exon 19 deletion), BRAF (G469A), APC (T1556fs), NF1 (A1610fs, D699fs), NOTCH1 (E473fs, C332Y, G546X) and PTCH1 (N1351fs). It was thought the patient with EGFR mutation is a case of NSCLC transformation to SCLC. Variants with unknown significance or unclassified variants detected in genes with clinical relevance and of potential interest for targeted therapy in SCLC include', ' DDR2, cMET, RET, FGFR1/3, BRCA2, IGF1R, RICTOR and NTRK1. Conclusion', ' Genomic and molecular characterization of SCLC samples reveals a heterogeneous population. Several potentially actionable targets are identified by NGS. Early reported trial data suggests susceptibility of SCLC to immune checkpoint inhibitors. We observed higher levels of PD1+ TILs, however differences in antibody clones, thresholds or staining localization (tumor cells vs. stromal lymphocytes), may account for the observed overall low PD-L1 expression. Further efforts are needed to identify and validate new therapeutic targets in SCLC.']",
