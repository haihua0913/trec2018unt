        "Background":"['Neuroblastoma is a developmental tumor that arises in the peripheral sympathetic nervous system and accounts for 10% of all cancer-related deaths in children. The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene is mutationally activated in a subset of primary neuroblastomas, including those with MYCN gene amplification, suggesting pathogenic cooperation. Because the mechanism underlying this cooperation is unclear, we generated a novel transgenic zebrafish model that overexpresses human MYCN and activated ALK in the peripheral sympathetic nervous system to analyze their interaction. The expression of MYCN in this model induces neuroblastomas in the inter-renal gland, the zebrafish analogue of the adrenal medulla, which is the site of origin observed in approximately half of childhood neuroblastomas. Furthermore, the tumors resemble human neuroblastomas histologically, immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally. Concomitant expression of activated ALK with MYCN in this model profoundly accelerates the onset of neuroblastoma and markedly increases disease penetrance. Detailed in vivo analyses show that MYCN overexpression induces adrenal sympathetic neuroblast hyperplasia, blocks chromaffin cell differentiation, and triggers a developmentally-timed apoptotic response in the hyperplastic sympathoadrenal cells. Coexpression of activated ALK with MYCN provides prosurvival signals that block this apoptotic response and allow continued expansion and oncogenic transformation of hyperplastic neuroblasts. Taken together, these findings provide a mechanism for the synergistic interplay of MYCN with activated ALK in neuroblastoma pathogenesis and demonstrate the utility of the zebrafish model in understanding human disease processes that may aid the development of improved therapeutic strategies.']",

Methods', '  To evaluate the role of ALK mutations in neuroblastoma progression or relapse, we searched for ALK mutations in a large series of 54 paired diagnosticrelapse neuroblastoma samples using Sanger sequencing. When an ALK mutation was observed in one sample, deep sequencing was used to seek for a minor mutated component in the other sample. With a coverage of > 100,000, the background variability was 0.034% per base at each position, resulting in a sensitivity to detect low frequency mutations in 0.15%.  Results', '  Among the paired samples, all 9 ALK-mutated cases at diagnosis demonstrated the same mutation at relapse by Sanger sequencing. Nevertheless, in one case, the mutation was detected in only one of several nodules at relapse. In contrast, in 5 cases, the mutation appeared relapse-specific. Among these, 4 cases could be further investigated by deep sequencing. In two cases no evidence of the mutation was observed at diagnosis. In one case, the mutation occurring at relapse could be identified at a sub-clonal level at diagnosis, whereas in another case, two different mutations resulting in identical amino acid changes could be detected at diagnosis and relapse. Further evidence of clonal evolution of ALK-mutated cells was provided by the observation of a minor ALK-mutated cell population in a tumour from which a cell line with ALK mutation in all cells was derived.    Conclusions', '   These results indicate that, in neuroblastoma, ALK mutations newly detected at the time of relapse can be present in a subclone at the time of diagnosis with subsequent clonal expansion at relapse. With the advent of targeted therapy using ALK inhibitors, precise knowledge of the ALK status is mandatory. Our observation of a significant spatio-temporal variation of ALK mutations is of utmost importance in clinical practice, highlighting the potential of NGS and the importance of serial samplings for therapeutic decisions.']",

        "Background":"['Background. Whereas ALK translocations play a role in tumor growth in selected NSCLC cases, mutated forms of ALK have been shown to drive development of neuroblastoma, the most common malignant extracranial tumor of childhood. The mutation F1147L in the oncogene ALK increases the kinase activity, causing deregulated proliferation of sympatho-adrenal progenitor cells. We explored the use of kinase activity measurements to identify ALK activity in cell lysates and patient derived tissue lysates with the aim of identifying biomarkers to trace the activity of ALK in tumors and the effect of ALK inhibitors on these marker signals. Methods. Protein kinase activities were measured on PamChip peptide microarrays comprising 144 Tyr containing peptide sequences from known human phosphorylation sites. The activity profiling experiments involved recombinant ALK kinase, lysates of cell lines overexpressing ALK and neuroblastoma tumors with elevated ALK F1174L presence. Per microarray analysis 5 ug of total protein was used in the presence of 100 uM ATP. Experiments were performed in the presence and absence of ALK kinase inhibitors crizotinib and NVP-TAE684. Real time kinetics of 144 peptide phosphorylations were measured with a fluorescently labeled antibody. Results. Phosphorylation profiles for neuroblastoma tumors, ALK overexpressing cell lines and recALK were generated. For recALK 48 novel peptide substrates were identified that showed signals depending on both ATP and kinase concentration and inhibition by the ALK inhibitors. In ALK overexpressing cell lines, but not in control cell lysates, signals on many ALK substrate peptides were significantly elevated, and returned to baseline level in the presence of ALK inhibitors. Whereas neuroblastomas with low ALK expression gave similar kinase activity profiles, the tumors harboring the ALK F1174L mutation were different, suggesting a more complex regulation of phosphorylation activity in these tumors. All tumors showed on-chip responses with ALK inhibitor drugs, but to different extent, which could be a basis for response prediction biomarker discovery. Conclusion. ALK activity of recombinant kinases, cell lysates and tumor lysates can be detected on PamChip peptide microarrays. Based on results with model systems, this method shows promise to identify tumors that express elevated ALK activity and to study response of this class to ALK inhibitors.']",

MYCN amplification is the major genetic aberration in high-risk neuroblastoma and is associated with poor outcome. Genome-wide association studies have identified activation mutations and high-level amplification of ALK in approximately 10% of neuroblastoma patients. In addition, ALK mutations can coexist with MYCN amplification, which defines a subset of ultra-high-risk neuroblastoma patients. In contrast to the high frequency of p53 mutations observed in many human cancers of adults, mutations of p53 are less common in childhood cancers and have been reported in less than 2% of neuroblastomas. Wild-type (WT) p53 is required for the activation of p53 signaling by Mdm2 inhibitors. This suggests that neuroblastoma could be amenable to intervention with Mdm2 inhibitors. In this study, we demonstrated that the ALK inhibitor, NVP-LDK378, in combination with a novel Mdm2 inhibitor, NVP-CGM097, promoted apoptosis in ALK mutant and p53 WT neuroblastoma cell lines. NVP-LDK378 inhibited ALK phosphorylation and NVP-CGM097 caused induction of p53 and its downstream target genes in these cell lines. Meanwhile, Mdm2 inhibition in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines significantly decreased the levels of Mycn protein. In addition, NVP-LDK378 and NVP-CGM097 combination resulted in complete tumor regression and markedly prolonged survival in neuroblastoma xenograft models.

        "Background":"['Activated ALK by mutation or amplification is a validated therapeutic target in a subset of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being developed to abrogate ALK signaling (Bresler et al, 2014). Native ALK is expressed on the surface of the majority of neuroblastoma tumors, but not on normal tissue, giving it properties of a tumor antigen. We hypothesized that ALK-targeted antibodies may be useful in neuroblastoma as single-agent immunotherapy or in combination with small-molecule ALK inhibitors - especially where mutations reduce kinase inhibitor sensitivity. In this work, an anti-ALK monoclonal antibody (anti-ALK2) was conjugated to a cytotoxic agent (ALK2-ADC) and its anti-tumor activity was investigated in a panel of extensively characterized human neuroblastoma cell lines (n = 10) harboring wild type and mutant ALK. Cell surface ALK was quantified using flow cytometry and revealed differential antigen expression. Using in vitro growth inhibition assays, there was evidence for a dose-dependent cytotoxicity to neuroblastoma cells at subnanomolar concentrations that correlated with ALK expression and was independent of underlying mutation status. In order to evaluate the therapeutic potential of ALK2-ADC in vivo, mice bearing Felix-patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors, containing the third most common ALK mutation (R1245C), were used to demonstrate that ALK2-ADC led to a significant reduction in tumor growth compared to unconjugated antibody and a control ADC (p<0.0001). Although ALK2-ADC binds potently to mouse ALK as well as human ALK, doses of up to 10 mg/kg in the rodent model appeared to be well tolerated with no overt toxicity noted. Additional in vivo studies are ongoing to assess the antitumor potential of the ADC in a broader range of ALK-expressing neuroblastoma models. Thus, targeting human ALK-expressing with an ALK antibody-drug conjugate demonstrated early signs of favorable efficacy and tolerability supporting future development of this approach as a potential novel therapeutic for patients with neuroblastoma.']",

R1275Q substitutions were most common (45%), followed by F1174L (15%). Evaluation of matched constitutional DNAs demonstrated 10% carried occult germline mutations. Integration of primary tumor microarrays from 76 samples showed that ALK mRNA expression was highly correlated with ALK DNA copy number (p=0.0005). ALK protein was nearly universally expressed (129/134; 93%), and there was evidence for ALK activation in 15% of tumors (pALK moderate or strong staining in 20/134), suggesting an additional and alternative pathway to ALK activation. A panel of 18 NB cell lines showed differential in vitro sensitivity to PF-2341066 dependent on ALK mutation and copy number status. A wild type (WT) amplified line and 2 lines harboring R1275Q mutations were sensitive (IC50 145 - 301 nM).

        "Background":"['Mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor represent an important therapeutic target in neuroblastoma. The most frequently occurring somatic mutation, ALK F1174L, is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib only at higher doses in vitro, and not at all in in vivo. Moreover, ALK F1174L mediates acquired resistance to crizotinib in ALK-rearranged cancers, posing a therapeutic challenge in these diseases. To identify critical components of ALK F1174L-associated signaling pathways that contribute to neuroblastoma cell survival and whose simultaneous inhibition with ALK F1174L could increase sensitivity to crizotinib, we exposed neuroblastoma cell lines expressing ALK F1174L (Kelly and SHSY-5Y) to crizotinib (at treatment doses and exposures times titrated to abolish ALK phosphorylation, but in the absence of any detectable commitment to apoptosis), and compared their ALK-inactive gene expression signatures with vehicle-treated control cells in which the ALK F1174L signature remained active. We noted differential expression of genes involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in cells in which ALK F1174L was inhibited with crizotinib, with downregulation of AKT1, 2 and 3 and elevated expression of mTOR. Immunoblotting confirmed that downregulation of pALK upon exposure to crizotinib was accompanied by downregulation of pAKT473, with unchanged or elevated pRPS6. To test the possibility that the cytotoxicity of crizotinib could be enhanced by simultaneous inhibition of this ALK-driven pathway, we tested crizotinib in combination with the ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor, Torin2, both in cell lines and in xenograft models of neuroblastoma expressing ALK F1174L. Treatment with crizotinib had no standalone activity as demonstrated by lack of effects on tumor volume or survival. Treatment with Torin2 significantly suppressed tumor growth, but this did not translate into a prolongation of survival. Combined treatment with Torin2 and crizotinib resulted in significant attenuation of tumor growth (p<0.001), and prolongation of survival in comparison to control animals, as well as single agent treatment with either Torin2 or crizotinib. RPS6 remained phosphorylated in neuroblastoma xenografts of mice treated exclusively with crizotinib but was downregulated in cells treated with Torin 2, and in those treated with the combination. Together, these results suggest that single agent treatment with crizotinib at standard doses is less efficacious due to persistent activation of mTOR signaling and that mTOR pathway inhibition should augment the activity of crizotinib in the treatment of patients with ALK F1174L-expressing neuroblastomas and may even delay the onset of resistance in ALK-rearranged cancers in which this pathway is activated.']",

        "Background":"['MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 22-24 nucleotides non-coding RNAs that can simultaneously influence the levels of multiple target genes and therefore have the potential to strongly silence cancer gene networks. MYCN and ALK are well established oncogenes implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of neuroblastoma. Using multiple web based algorithms we have identified potential tumor suppressor miRNAs that can control the pathogenesis and/or progression of neuroblastoma by down-regulating both MYCN and ALK. We found hsa-miR-1323 as a candidate tumor suppressor for neuroblastoma. Lipofectamine based mimic transfection and lentiviral vector based over-expression of miR-1323 in cell lines led to a decrease in MYCN and ALK transcripts as well as signals from luciferase reporter constructs carrying the 3-UTR of MYCN or ALK validating MYCN and ALK as direct targets of miR-1323. However, unexpectedly for this predicted tumor suppressor microRNA, gain of function studies for miR-1323 in neuroblastoma cell lines demonstrated increased proliferation, colony formation and tumor growth of orthotopic xenograft tumors. As SiRNA against MYCN strongly limits neuroblastoma proliferation, our data suggests that miR-1323 targets an alternative tumor suppressor pathway which by-passes the growth suppressive effects of MYCN inhibition and drives proliferation. Further bio-informatics analysis of putative miR-1323 targets pointed to PAG1 (or Cbp) as a possible tumor suppressor target of miR-1323. The transmembrane adaptor protein PAG1 inhibits proliferation driven by the Src family of kinases (SFKs) through multiple mechanisms and is a known tumor suppressor in leukemia and non-small cell lung cancers. Importantly, analysis of PAG1 in clinical cohorts of neuroblastoma reveals that low expression of PAG1 strongly correlates with poor overall survival compared to patients with high levels of PAG1 expression (p <0.001). We have confirmed that miR-1323 targets PAG1 transcript via qRT-PCR assays, and this is associated with increased p-ERK levels in neuroblastoma cell lines. We therefore propose that miR-1323 mediated repression of PAG1 activates the Src-dependent oncogenic pathways, overriding its effect on MYCN or ALK, and contributing to the aggressive clinical behavior of high-risk neuroblastoma. These studies further demonstrate the complexity of microRNA functions in normal and cancer cells and mandate careful evaluation of putative tumor suppressive microRNAs as therapeutic tools.']",

        "Background":"[\"Neuroblastomas (NBs) harboring activating point mutations in the kinase domain of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are differentially sensitive to ALK inhibition by crizotinib (Bresler et al. 2011). The F1174L and F1245C amino acid substitutions, which comprise 38.5% (mycancergenome.org) of ALK aberrations in NB, also confer intrinsic resistance to crizotinib and present a significant obstacle in the clinic. Therefore, our goal has been to identify a next-generation ALK inhibitor with improved selectivity and potency to target these resistant mutants effectively. We demonstrate here that PF-06463922 (Pfizer), an ATP-competitive, macrocyclic ALK/ROS1 inhibitor, overcomes crizotinib resistance of these ALK variants in NB, and exerts unprecedented activity as a single agent against the F1174L and F1245C ALK-mutated tumors. At a tenfold lower dose (10 mg/kg) than typically used for crizotinib (100 mg/kg), PF-06463922 induces complete tumor regression in patient-derived (COG-N-426x, F1245C ALK-mutated) and cell line-derived (SY5Y, F1174L ALK-mutated) xenograft mouse models. Whereas crizotinib-treated mice in both models experience rapid tumor growth on therapy, PF-06463922-treated mice showed sustained complete responses for several weeks even after treatment was discontinued. Cell-based and biochemical analyses indicate that the superior activity of PF-06463922 is a function of both higher potency and a broader spectrum of effectiveness across mutants. ATP levels were measured in ten NB cell lines upon treatment with PF-06463922 and crizotinib; at 120 hours post-treatment, PF-06463922 is 26-38 times more effective at inducing growth inhibition in cells with primary resistance than crizotinib. These in vitro and in vivo results are corroborated by our biochemical experiments. In comparative kinase inhibition studies of several next-generation ALK inhibitors, PF-06463922 was most effective against frequently observed ALK variants accounting for approximately 75% of neuroblastoma samples, including those with F1174L mutations. In vitro, PF-06463922 showed at least 3-4 fold higher potency than crizotinib in peptide phosphorylation assays, and its superior inhibition was consistently observed in cellular analysis of transforming ability. Further investigation is necessary to elucidate PF-06463922's mechanism of action and reveal how it induces apoptotic signaling networks without abrogating phospho-ALK. Taken together, these results support the argument that a modified ALK inhibitor may improve outcomes for patients with primary resistance to crizotinib and provide the preclinical basis from which to design a clinical trial for PF-06463922 for the treatment of ALK-mutated NBs.\"]",

Although recent studies have revealed that anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) signal is aberrantly activated in high-risk group of NB due to nonsynonymous mutations, gene amplification and mutation-independent overexpression, the regulatory mechanism of the signal remains elusive. Recently, we have identified neuronal leucine rich repeat 1 (NLRR1), a type I transmembrane protein, as a poor prognostic marker in NB and, notably, it accelerates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signal to enhance cell proliferation. Here we have revealed that NLRR1 functionally affects ALK signal and vice versa in NB.Material & Methods', ' Cell growth of NB cell lines was evaluated by WST-8 assay or living cell imaging system. Immunoprecipitation was performed to check protein-protein interactions and concentrate secreted proteins. Further binding studies were performed by utilizing alkaline phosphatase-tagged and Fc-tagged proteins. Quantification of secreted proteins was assessed by sandwich ELISA assay. For ALK and EGFR signal inhibition, NB cells were treated with crizotinib, alectinib and erlotinib. The expression levels of ALK and NLRR1 were evaluated in embryonic Nlrr1 knockout mice as well as in the NB clinical samples by immunohistochemistry.Results', ' In the binding assays including immunoprecipitation, we found that NLRR1 extracellular domain physically interacted with the full-length ALK. Unexpectedly, NLRR1 expression suppressed ALK phosphorylation and cell proliferation in ALK-positive NB cells. Similar inhibitory effect was also observed by the treatment of the conditioned medium from the culture of NLRR1-expressing cells, suggesting a soluble form of NLRR1 protein. Certainly, the additional investigation confirmed that NLRR1 was cleaved to generate a soluble fragment of the extracellular domain. Conversely ALK inhibitors (ALKi) treatment resulted in up-regulation of NLRR1 and EGFR. Furthermore, EGF treatment restored ALKi-induced cell growth suppression. Additional erlotinib treatment certainly competed with the EGF rescue effect against ALKi. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that NLRR1 and ALK showed mutually exclusive expression pattern in NB tissues and murine embryonic dorsal root ganglia.Conclusion', ' We have identified the bilateral regulatory system between ALK and NLRR1, in which NLRR1 suppresses ALK phosphorylation whereas the inhibition of ALK results in the elevated expression of NLRR1 and EGFR. These findings in part support their mutually exclusive expression pattern in developing neural tissues and human NB. Further study should clarify the pathological meaning of the heterogeneity between ALK and NLRR1/EGFR pathways to develop a novel dual inhibition therapy in NB.']",

        "Background":"['Neuroblastoma (NBL), the most common solid tumor of childhood, is an embryonal malignancy of the developing sympathetic nervous system. Human Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has been identified as an oncogene mutated or amplified in NBLs. However, the role of wild-type ALK in NBL is still largely unknown. For better understanding a molecular event associated with ALK in the pathogenesis of NBL, it is necessary to clarify how ALK gene contributes to NBL progression. Previously in the analysis of NBL clinical samples, we have found that ALK expression is significantly high in MYCN amplified group. Consistent with this evidence, the developing tumors with NBL characteristics in MYCN-transgenic mice possess a high expression of ALK. In the present study, we have found that overexpression of MYCN induced ALK expression and siRNA-mediated knockdown of MYCN resulted in the downregulation of ALK expression in NBL and non-NBL cell lines. We have identified the promoter region of ALK, to which MYCN binds, in the upstream of the first exon from +30 to 350 bp and Luciferase reporter assay showed that MYCN overexpression enhanced the promoter activity of ALK. The site-specific deletion at MYCN binding site of ALK promoter region downregulated its promoter activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay indicated that MYCN can be recruited to the ALK promoter region, suggesting that ALK is directly regulated by MYCN. In general, high expression of MYCN is a well-known prognostic marker for aggressive progression and increases growth rate of NBL cells. However, the role of MYCN in enhancing cell migration and invasion has not yet been fully understood. We have further examined an effect of ALK expression in MYCN-induced cell migration. Functional assay revealed that overexpression of ALK enhanced NBL cell growth, migration as well as invasion. Moreover, these activities were suppressed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of ALK, indicating that ALK might be involved in the metastatic phenotype of NBLs. On the other hand, the forced expression of MYCN enhanced cell migration in MYCN-single copy cell line, SK-N-AS cells. Of interest, the increased migration by MYCN expression was suppressed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of ALK, suggesting that the cell migration induced by MYCN is at least partly regulated by ALK expression. Our present findings explore the fundamental understanding of ALK and help a future development of novel therapeutic tools by targeting ALK for aggressive NBLs.']",

        "Background":"['Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood. One of its hallmarks is high histological heterogeneity. The primary tumors are composed of neuroblastic cancer cells, Schwannian stroma and some infiltrating immune cells. The origin and functions of Schwannian stroma still remain controversial. It is suggested that they are tumor-infiltrating normal cells. Studies using Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (BMSCs) or Schwann cells to mimic Schwannian stroma have shown both tumor promoting or suppression effects. An alternative hypothesis is that Schwannian cells are derived from cancer stem-like cells since they shared the same genetic lesions with neuroblastic tumor cells. Our laboratory had reported that in the SK-N-SH cell line, both N-type cells (neuroblastic cells) and S-type cells (Schwann-like cells) shared almost identical genetic background. These cell lines may serve as relevant models to study NB tumor heterogeneity. Genome-wide sequencing for driver oncogenes in familial NB uncovered mutations in Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene. ALK point mutations have been found in 8-12% of all NB patients, and are restricted to the kinase domain. Aberrant activation of ALK signaling, and its downstream target, PI3K/AKT, STAT3 and ERK1/2, can contribute to NB tumorigenesis. Thus, ALK is an intensely studied therapeutic target. Sublines of N-type and S-type cells were isolated from an early passage of SK-N-SH. Surprisingly, over 90% have cell morphology that resembled S-type cells. Sequencing analysis revealed that all harbored the same ALK F1174L mutation, indicating they were tumor-derived. Western blotting analysis showed that N-type cells, but not S-type cells, expressed ALK protein. This may explain the insensitivity of S-type cells towards ALK inhibitor, TAE684. Next, co-culture experiments showed that S-type cells protected N-type cells from apoptosis induced by TAE684. Western blotting analysis showed that ALK, AKT and STAT3 signaling were stimulated in the co-culture. Furthermore, conditioned medium (CM) from Schwann-like cells activated these downstream signaling molecules in N-type cells, indicating secreted factors from S-type cells contributed to the pathway stimulations. As AKT and STAT3 were ALK downstream targets, ALK ligand could be a potential factor. We further confirmed these results in two additional ALK WT N-type cell lines, IMR 32 and BE (2)-M17. Co-cultivation and CM experiments had demonstrated robust STAT3 activation even without ALK stimulation. Overall, tumor-derived S-type cells could prevent N-type cells from apoptosis via secreted factors. The signaling involved could be separated into an ALK-independent STAT3 activation and a ligand-activated ALK-AKT pathway. Future work will focus on identifying STAT3 stimulators and ALK ligands in CM of S-type cells.

We determined that the synergistic effect was mediated preferentially through the transcriptional, rather than the cell cycle activity of these CDK inhibitors, denoted by absence of cell cycle arrest, stalling of RNA polymerase II at representative gene promoters, and loss of Pol II phosphorylation at the transcription elongation marker serine 2 in treated cells. These findings were comparable with results obtained using agents that were highly selective for CDK9 or CDK7, CDKs with roles in transcription regulation.

NBL tumors display a broad clinical and biological heterogeneity, ranging from highly aggressive tumors with fatal outcome to tumors with spontaneous regression. Recurrent mutations are mainly only observed in Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK), which is involved in the pathogenesis of both familiar and sporadic NBL. ALK encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor with importance in neuronal development and was initially characterized in anaplastic large cell lymphoma from a translocation leading to the NPM-ALK fusion protein. Subsequent studies show that additional ALK chimeras have been generated with different fusion partners in various cancers. To date no ALK-containing rearrangement has been reported in primary NBL tumors although one study has describeda NBL cell line with an ALK intragenic deletion leading to constitutive ALK kinase activity. This led us to screen for and further investigate possible ALK containing translocations in our NBL material.Genomic profiling of 350 NBL samples though SNP microarrays indicated ALK-rearrangement in four primary tumors and two cell lines (IMR32 and CLB-BAR) which were further analyzed through targeted re-sequencing of the common MYCN amplicon region (Chr2;14-18Mb) and the entire ALK gene. Briefly, detection of rearrangements was performed through solution-based enrichment followed pair-end sequencing of 400-500bp libraries.Junction sites were identified by manual sequence viewing on IGV and validated through PCR followed by Sanger sequencing.With this strategy we were able to determine translocation sites for all but one sample. In one tumor ALK was found to be translocated to GAB2 (chr11q14) causing loss of the first exon of respective gene. However,ALK and GAB2 were placed head-to-head with respect to transcription direction and this novel translocation is therefore unlikely to cause a chimeric protein. Another tumor showed translocation between ALK intron 4 and chr 4 subtelomeric region without known genes. Two NBL cell lines and one tumor had both MYCN and ALK amplification and sequencing revealed high level complexity of respective amplicon with multiple rearrangements. IMR32 show involvement of at least six different 2p-regions including MYCN and ALK exon 3-4. CLB-BAR has also multiple rearrangements including an ALK intragenic translocation causing loss of exon 4-11, ultimately resulting in an ALK protein with truncated extracellular domain.Here we show that ALK translocation sites could be deduced from targeted re-sequencing without previous knowledge about fusion partner. However, no translocations resulting in chimeric protein were detected. We were also able to detect MYCN amplicon junctions, which are highly unique for each patient and could be used for detection of minimal residual disease.']",

The discovery of the RNAi has great promise for anti-cancer therapeutics but, as in high-grade solid tumors a single oncogene addiction is rare, multi-'gene' target combinations are required and a targeted delivery system is mandatory to successfully translate RNAi-based therapeutics into the clinics.It is now ascertained the master role of ALK and related genes such as PHOX2B, able to promote its transcription, in NB growth and survival, opening new perspectives for RNAi-mediated therapies for NB. Nevertheless, even if the counterpart of tumor suppressor (TS) regulators in NB is not completely known, a number of miRNAs with TS functions have been found aberrantly under-expressed in NB and associated with aggressive phenotypes.To develop a new generation of targeted and multi-RNAi-directed therapeutics for NB, we are exploiting our well-established NB-specific delivery system, the GD2-Targeted Liposomes entrapping specific siRNAs, TL[siRNA], or miRNAs mimics, TL[miRNA]. The final purpose is to get simultaneously the silencing of the oncogenic functions of ALK and related genes and the replacement of miRNAs with TS functions in clinically relevant mouse models of NB. We have planned to test different combinations of individually entrapped TL[siRNA] or TL[miRNA] for in vivo therapeutic efficacy.In a pilot study, NB-bearing mice were treated with different TL[siRNA]. After 65 days from i.v. injection of HTLA-230 (WT ALK) cells, we observed\", ' about 50% of TL[siALK]-treated mice still disease-free, marginal effects with TL[siPHOX2A] and moderate effects with TL[siPHOX2B] formulations alone and a significant increased mice survival with an equimolar combination of TL[siRNA] of each gene. The enhanced efficacy of ALK and PHOX2 genes knockdown combination highlights a powerful therapeutic potential.After pilot transfection studies of SH-SY5Y (F1174L mut ALK) and GI-LI-N (WT ALK) cell lines, TS miRNAs mimics were screened and selected. Cell proliferation was evaluated at different days post-transfection. miR-96, miR-34a and let7b replacement resulted the most effective in inhibiting NB cell growth. Liposomal preparation of miRNA-NC and the above mimics for in vivo studies was tuned up according to the number of negative charges of the stem-loop sequence with an entrapment efficiency of 80-90%. Currently, an ongoing in vivo trial indicates promising results after replacement of miR-34a and let7b.We believe that the use of tumor-targeted biocompatible carriers of RNAi molecules able to replace loss-of-functions and to knockdown gain-of-functions in cancer cells at the same time is likely to represent an innovative modality for a more effective gene therapy.']",

Genomic studies show that PTPN11 (encoding SHP2) is the second most frequently mutated genes in high-risk neuroblastoma. We have now used our zebrafish model to ask whether mutationally activated SHP2 functions as an oncogene in neuroblastoma. We developed a transgenic line in which ptpn11E69K is overexpressed in the PSNS under control of the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase promoter. Interestingly, ptpn11E69K synergized with MYCN to accelerate the onset of neuroblastoma in the interrenal gland (IRG), the zebrafish analogue of the adrenal medulla. Tumors began to appear at 15 weeks in transgenic fish overexpressing MYCN alone, whereas latency was shortened to 7 weeks and the penetrance was increased more than four-fold in transgenic fish coexpressing MYCN and ptpn11E69K. Coexpression of ptpn11E69K and MYCN also induced ganglioneuroma in the sympathetic ganglia, an outcome that has not been observed in transgenic fish overexpressing MYCN and activated ALK.

One such molecule is TAE684, a structurally unrelated ATP-competitive diaminopyrimidine derivative that has shown activity against ALKF1174L in both in vitro and in vivo models of ALK-driven cancers, such as lung cancer and NB.To identify mechanisms of acquired resistance to TAE684, we established in vitro models of resistance by serially exposing TAE684-sensitive SH-SY5Y NB cells (expressing ALKF1174L) to increasing concentrations of the compound over a prolonged period (> 1 year). The resulting TAE684-resistant SY5Y-TR cells exhibited >10-fold reduced sensitivity to TAE684 compared with parental cells. Three TAE684-resistant clonal lines (TR1-TR3) were analyzed, all of which showed downregulation of pALK. In addition, TR1 cells showed downregulation of pAKT but increased expression of pERK1/2 compared to parental cells, suggesting activation of compensatory signaling pathways. To identify candidate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that may account for this observation, we analyzed TR1 cells using phospho-RTK arrays. Upregulation of the AXL RTK was seen in the resistant cells as compared to the parental cells, and this was confirmed by immunoblotting in all the resistant clones. Concurrent with the role of AXL in tumor cell invasion, TR1 cells exhibited increased invasiveness in matrigel assays. Depletion of AXL expression by shRNA knockdown in TR1 cells led to their growth inhibition. TR1 cells were more sensitive to SKI-606, a Src/Abl inhibitor with activity against AXL, than parental cells. However, exposure to an Hsp90 inhibitor led to significant cytotoxicity in all the clones (IC50s<30nM), as compared to parental cells (IC50=304nM). Inhibiting Hsp90 in the TR1 cells led to a decrease in pAXL and pERK1/2 levels with a concomitant decrease in the binding of AXL to Hsp90. Analysis of AXL in TR1 cells ruled out mutation, genomic amplification or promoter demethylation as a basis for its increased expression; however, the AXL ligand, GAS6, was increased in the resistant clones.These studies demonstrate that AXL activation contributes to TAE684 resistance in ALKF1174L-expressing cells, and suggests that the same would be true for derivatives of TAE684 in clinical development. The finding that AXL is also involved in EGFR-targeted therapy in lung cancer suggests that AXL activation could be a general mechanism of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.']",

The stromal compartment of neuroblastoma is composed mostly of Schwann cells and they play critical roles in the differentiation, survival and angiogenic responses of tumor cells. In certain neuroblastoma cell lines, the coexistence of neuroblastic N-type and substrate-adherent S-type is frequently observed. One such cell line, SK-N-SH, harbors a F1174L oncogenic mutation in the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene. Treatment of SK-N-SH with an ALK chemical inhibitor, TAE684, resulted in the outgrowth of S-type cells that expressed the Schwann cell marker, S1006. Nucleotide sequencing analysis of these TAE684-resistant (TR) sublines revealed the presence of the ALK F1174L mutation suggesting their tumor origin, although ALK protein was not detected. Consistent with these findings, TR cells displayed 9-fold higher IC50 values than N-type cells. Also, unlike N-type cells, TR cells have readily detectable phosphorylated STAT3 but weaker phosphorylated AKT. Under co-culture conditions, TR cells conferred survival to N-type cells against the apoptotic effect of TAE684. Co-cultivation also greatly enhanced the overall phosphorylation of STAT3 and its transcriptional activity in N-type cells. Finally, conditioned medium from TR clones enhanced cell viability of N-type cells and this effect was Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase-dependent. Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability of tumor-derived S-type cells in protecting N-type cells against the apoptotic effect of an ALK kinase inhibitor through upregulating pro-survival signaling.

We investigated the alterations in ALK gene by FISH analysis, immunohistochemistry and screened for ALK mutations by sequencing the ALK gene in 737 CRC. We screened for mutations in ALK by sequencing the tyrosine kinase domain that covers exons 20 -28. ALK alterations were correlated with tumor pathological features including TNM staging, MSI status, KRAS and BRAF mutations, as well as clinical outcome. Overall survival was analyzed using Kaplan Meyer plots. On FISH analysis in colorectal cancers, ALK amplifications were observed in 2.6%. Amplifications and gain with increase in gene copy number(4 to 6 copies) were seen in 3.4%. No translocations were seen in our study. There were no associations with nodal metastasis and other clinical or molecular parameters. However in Stage III & IV, ALK amplification was associated with KRAS mutations. CRC subgroup with ALK amplifications showed a poor overall survival overall survival and ALK gene amplifications was an independent prognostic marker in multivariate Cox proportional Hazards model. IHC showed cytoplasmic overexpression in 14.7% CRCs and no associations with any clinical or molecular parameters. We are screening for ALK mutations in 100 CRC samples and results are awaited. The insights gained from our current study and future clinical trials are likely to directly benefit subgroups of CRC patients whose tumors are driven by ALK and will pave the way to more targeted approaches to cancer treatment.']",

        "Background":"['Neuroblastoma is the most common non-CNS tumor in children. High-risk disease has a dire prognosis and new treatment strategies are need. The identification of unique cell-surface proteins expressed on tumor cells, yet not expressed on normal tissues, has been challenging for pediatric malignancies. However, identification of such antigens allows for the development of new immune-based therapies featuring Ig-like binding motifs. The cell surface tyrosine kinase ALK (CD246, anaplastic lymphoma kinase) is a promising target for neuroblastoma in that it is expressed in either native, mutated, or over-expressed forms on the plasma membrane surface of the tumor cell and may contribute to disease progression or severity. We identified antibodies that bind to extracellular domains of ALK, sequenced their variable regions, and used this sequence information to construct chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Primary human T lymphocytes were then transduced with retroviral gene vectors expressing a series of ALK-specific CAR. We tested CARs that incorporated both different structural and signaling motifs. Transduced T cells demonstrated ALK-specific cytolytic activity against ALK-expressing tumors and produced Th1 cytokines upon culture in the presence of tumor. In exploring different iterations of CAR domain structure we found that the scFv domains created from the heavy and light variable domains of ALK-specific immunoglobulin could be interchanged with respect to their orientation in the context of CAR tertiary protein structure. Moreover, ALK-specific scFv functioned whether expressed in a short format, that is as a single domain proximal to the T cell membrane, or in a long format, that is extended away from the plasma membrane using an IgG1-derived spacer domain composed of CH2 and CH3. Using a xenogeneic NSG mouse model for neuroblastoma, human ALK-specific CAR-expressing T cells were found to eradicate ALK-positive tumor, when IL-7 was included to support T cell persistence. These data argue for the continued evaluation of ALK-specific CARs in pre-clinical studies.']",

We hypothesize that subclonal mutations in NB oncogenes are common at diagnosis, are biomarkers for treatment failure, and can be targeted in conjunction with standard chemotherapy to improve patient survival. Here, we focus on the first aspect of this broad hypothesis by presenting the subclonal landscape of diagnostic, high-risk neuroblastomas. A meta-analysis of our previously published primary/relapse (N=23), whole exome (N=232) and whole genome (N=159) diagnostic data, and recent sequencing study of 78 diagnostic and 67 relapse cases were used to inform design of a custom amplicon panel for ultra-deep sequencing.

        "Background":"['The clinical success of crizotinib against mutant ALK-expressing cancers has generated great interest; however, the emergence of drug resistance is limiting its durability in some patients. In NSCLC, crizotinib resistance is linked to secondary mutations within EML4-ALK at amino acids L1196M, C1156Y, L1152R. A mutation at amino acid F1174L reduced the sensitivity to criozotinib in a patient with an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor harboring a RANBP2-ALK translocation. The goal of our studies was to evaluate mechanisms of crizotinib resistance in a range of ALK-mutant expressing cell lines. Cells from ALCL (Karpas299), NSCLC (NCI-H3122 and NCI-H2228) or neuroblastoma (SKNSH and KELLY) developed resistance to crizotinib after being exposed to incremental increases in the compound over several weeks. NPM-ALK expressing Karpas299 cells independently acquired point mutations in ALK at amino acids N1178H and I1171N. As the concentration of drug was increased, cells that harbored the NPM-ALK N1178H mutation also expressed a mutation at G1269A. Each mutation enhanced the temperature dependent auto-phosphorylation activity of the kinase and diminished the inhibitory effect of crizotinib on downstream ALK signaling. Mutations in Karpas299 cells were also accompanied by up regulation of a drug efflux transporter, BCRP, whose heightened expression level was dependent on the presence of the compound. In contrast no additional mutations were discovered in ALK in crizotinib resistant NCI-H3122 and NCI-H2228 (EML4-ALK) or SKNSH and KELLY (ALK F1174L) cell lines. Instead both NCI-H3122 and NCI-H2228 resistant cell lines displayed increased levels of phospho-HER2 and HER3 and activation of AKT and ERK that may be due to autocrine secretion of a growth factor. NSCLC resistant lines also displayed an apparent change in phenotype with a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. SKNSH and KELLY are inherently less sensitive to crizotinib. We found that these cells may survive exposure to high levels of the compound by altering RET expression. Our observations represent potential mechanisms of resistance demonstrated in a small number of cell lines. It will be important to align these results with emerging data from drug-resistant patients to understand the multiple mechanisms by which resistance might develop.']",

The molecular defects driving relapse and drug resistance are unknown.MethodsWe performed Illumina or Complete Genomics whole genome sequencing of 23 paired diagnostic and relapsed neuroblastomas, and corresponding normal lymphocyte DNA, to define genetic alterations associated with relapse. A panel of 18 neuroblastoma cell lines was analyzed for the presence of RAS-MAPK mutations and sensitivity to small molecule inhibitors of this pathway.ResultsNeuroblastomas that relapsed after chemotherapy showed dramatic clonal evolution, with only 33% of primary tumor mutations also detected at relapse. In 21 out of 23 patients, more somatic coding mutations were observed at relapse (median', ' 29 unique to relapse, range', ' 4-129). Unbiased pathway analysis of the somatic mutations detected in the relapse tissues identified a strong enrichment in genes associated with RAS-MAPK signaling (p = 6.1107). 18 of the 23 cases (78%) showed somatic mutations (N = 15) or structural alterations (N = 3) predicted to activate the MAPK pathway, and these were mutually exclusive', ' ALK (N = 10), NRAS (N = 1), KRAS (N = 1), HRAS (N = 1), BRAF (N = 1), PTPN11 (N = 1), FGRF1 (N = 1) and NF1 (N = 2). These RAS-MAPK mutations were clonally enriched at relapse and exist within clonal or major subclonal tumor populations. Seven of these RAS-MAPK mutations were detected only in the relapse tumor by whole genome sequencing (50X coverage), and only 2 of these 7 mutations were detectable in the primary tumor with targeted detection methods (104-105X coverage). Similar MAPK pathway mutations were detected in 11 of 18 human neuroblastoma-derived cell lines, and these lesions are predicted to be sensitive to small molecule inhibition of MEK in vitro (p<0.001) and in vivo (p<0.05).ConclusionsIn this study of 23 neuroblastoma cases selected based solely on having diagnostic-relapse specimens available for analysis, MAPK pathway mutations were highly enriched in the relapsed genomes, providing a potential biomarker for new therapeutic approaches to chemotherapy refractory disease. The fact that several ALK-RAS-MAPK mutations were found in the relapse but not in the corresponding primary tumors favors a model in which rare subclones with secondary driver mutations expand over time. However, it remains to be determined whether these mutations occurred de novo after treatment, were present in rare subclones below detection limits, or were undetectable due to spatial heterogeneity of the primary tumor, which will impact the clinical utility of targeted sequencing at diagnosis. Our study provides strong rationale for performing biopsies on relapse neuroblastoma tumors in order to comprehensively characterize the molecular lesions that underlie treatment-refractory disease, determine their prognostic relevance, and guide treatment decisions for patients.']",

        "Background":"['In neuroblastoma, mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase gene have been identified in 8-10 % of primary tumors. The most common and potent ALK mutation, ALKF1174L, leads to the constitutive activation of the ALK protein and is associated preferentially with MYCN amplification, a markedly poorer prognosis, and confers resistance to the promising ALK inhibitor crizotinib. The development of more efficacious ALK inhibitors will benefit from non-invasive imaging strategies for the rapid identification of children with high-risk ALK-expressing or mutated neuroblastoma.Intrinsic susceptibility magnetic resonance imaging (IS-MRI) data was acquired from tumors arising in TH-ALKF1174L/TH-MYCN and TH-MYCN mice, two genetically engineered mouse model of high-risk neuroblastoma. The native MRI transverse relaxation rate R2*, an imaging biomarker sensitive to the concentration of paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin, and changes in R2* induced with 100% oxygen inhalation, were quantified. Tumors in the TH-ALKF1174L/TH-MYCN mice demonstrated significantly (p<0.0001) slower native R2* rates (61  3s1, n=23) than tumors in the TH-MYCN mice (101  6s1, n=21). With hyperoxic challenge, the TH-ALKF1174L/TH-MYCN mice demonstrated a significantly (p<0.0001) lower and negligible R2*oxygen-air (-3  1s1, n=10) compared with tumors in TH-MYCN mice (-26  3s1, n=12). A sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 81% for native R2*, and a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 94% for hyperoxia-induced R2* was determined.Histological correlates revealed a significantly (p<0.05) higher uptake of the perfusion marker Hoechst 33342, and the presence of large hemorrhagic blood lakes filled with stagnant deoxygenated erythrocytes, in tumors within the TH-MYCN mice, but not the TH-ALKF1174L/TH-MYCN model. Together these corroborate the IS-MRI findings (relatively fast native R2* and significant R2*, indicative of vascular instability, in tumors in the TH-MYCN mice).IS-MRI provides a robust method to discriminate and identify TH-MYCN transgenic mice harboring the ALKF1174L mutation based on a stark differential vascular phenotype, which may impact on impaired drug delivery. IS-MRI is suitable for the scanning of young children, and quantitation of native R2* easily incorporated into existing pediatric clinical imaging protocols. This approach could provide a robust and rapid indicator of ALK genotypic status of the tumor, enabling the early identification of children with ultra high-risk neuroblastoma at the time of diagnosis.']",

Many studies on sporadic cases with advanced NB have shown ALK mutated or highly expressed independently of its genetic status (mutated, amplified, wild-type) and its pivotal role in NB growth and survival. As ALK is currently considered a master driver of NB oncogenesis, the use of therapies inhibiting ALK represents a suitable treatment option.The ALK inhibitor Crizotinib was recently approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC patient. However, as often observed with kinase inhibitors, some patients develop acquired resistance in part due to genetic ALK mutations. To overcome this limitation a selective and more potent ALK inhibitor, X-396, was developed that is currently in phase I clinical trial in adult patients with advanced solid tumors, but it has not been tested in preclinical animal models of NB.We have successfully employed a RNAi-mediated therapeutic approach to selectively knockdown ALK expression by using nanoliposomes entrapping siRNA and coupled with anti-GD2 antibodies to target NB cells. Our data demonstrate for the first time a role of ALK in NB-induced angiogenesis and in tumor invasion.Here, we aimed to test whether the combination of the novel ALK kinase inhibitor X-396 with the liposome-based silencing of ALK could represent a powerful synergistic and or additive effect in NB xenografts to promote long-term survival.In vitro, X-396 showed to be more effective than Crizotinib in inhibiting cell proliferation and in inducing cell death in both LAN-5 (R1275Q ALK mut, Crizotinib-sensitive) and SH-SY5Y (F1174L ALK mut, Crizotinib-resistant) cells.Pharmacokinetic profiles of X-396 after multiple PO administration in NB-xenografts revealed a good bioavailability and a moderate half-life. Biodistribution study clearly indicated that the concentration of X-396 8h post-administration was 35 fold higher in the tumor site than in plasma. X-396 reduced the tumor volume in subcutaneous SH-SY5Y NB-model in a dose-dependent manner and it was more effective than Crizotinib when administered at the same concentration. In orthotopic xenografts of SH-SY5Y and LAN-5 cells, X-396 significantly increased life span. In combination studies, all effects were significantly improved in the mice treated with targeted liposomal formulation of ALK-siRNA and X-396 compared to untreated control mice or mice receiving the single agent treatments. In the latter studies, further enhancement of life span was obtained by increasing the X-396 dose. Moreover, the combined treatment was also proven to be effective in the SH-SY5Y-pseudometastatic model in determining long-term survivors.

We performed WTS of 139 NBLs (118 high-risk stage 4 and 21 stage 4S tumors) which had whole genome sequencing or whole exome sequencing of case-matched tumor/normal pairs through the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) initiative. We identified expressed mutations, fusion genes, and correlations between gene expression and clinical parameters of patients such as survival to provide understandings of high-risk NBL biology.Out of 1500 protein-coding changing somatic nucleotide variants detected by DNA sequencing, 614 variants (41%) were also detected in the transcriptome. Twenty-four genes known to be recurrently mutated in NBL showed the exact mutations in their transcriptome as seen in the DNA, including ALK (9.4%), ATRX (2.2%) and MYCN (1.4%). Fusion gene analysis identified in-frame fusions involving ALK (n = 2) and FOXR1 genes (n = 4). All tumors positive for ALK- and FOXR1-fusions expressed transcripts containing ALK or FOXR1 sequences at much higher levels (>10 folds) than those without fusion in these respective genes. Consensus clustering using tumor gene expression profiles revealed 4 subgroups with distinct survival probability. Among them, several molecular signatures including MYC activation and tumor microenvironment were observed. Intriguingly, 58% tumors without MYCN-amplification showed a MYC activation signature significantly associated with worse overall survival (p = 0.0017). Further examination of these tumors with the MYC activation signature revealed different somatic alterations including MYCN P44L mutations, high expression of other MYC family members (MYC and MYCL), mutations in the RAS pathway, and FOXR1 fusions. Interestingly, a gene expression signature representing tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and regulatory T-cells significantly correlated with a worse outcome in NBLs with normal MYCN copy number, similar to that seen in tumors with the MYC activation signature. In contrast, NBL patients with tumors showing a signature of cytotoxic T-cells and B-cells have better outcomes. Furthermore, tumors of the latter subgroup express significantly more somatic SNVs comparing to the other two subgroups of worse outcome with MYC activation or TAM signatures, suggesting that expressed neo-antigens may elevate cytotoxic T-cell response in these tumors.

Deregulated ALK expression has been linked to the development of several types of cancers. Typically, chromosomal translocations involving ALK generate constitutively expressed chimeric oncoproteins, such as NPM-ALK in anaplastic large cell lymphoma and EML4-ALK in non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, activating mutations in ALK, and increased copy number that result in aberrant gene expression, have also been observed in neuroblastoma and colorectal cancers. Based on the above observations, several small molecule ALK inhibitors have been developed and are in clinical trials for a variety of tumors expressing this kinase. This has resulted in the use of crizotinib for the treatment of EML4-ALK + lung cancers.Recently several large scale immunohistochemistry and genome sequencing studies of pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) revealed aberrant ALK expression. It was found that ALK mRNA expression was significantly different in alveolar (ARMS) and embryonic RMS (ERMS), the two major histological subtypes in children. Thus, ALK expression might play a role in tumorigenesis for this disease, and this kinase may represent a valid therapeutic target for the treatment of RMS. To answer this question we analyzed ALK expression in a large panel of RMS cell lines, and pediatric tumor samples by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. We also compared the sensitivity of these cells to a series of ALK inhibitors. Our results indicate that the majority of ARMS cell lines demonstrated significantly higher ALK mRNA expression as compared to ERMS, and to normal human myoblast control cells. This was confirmed by western analysis. Growth inhibition assays confirmed that all RMS lines were more sensitive to crizotinib and LDK-378 than control lines, consistent with the hypothesis that ALK is a driver of cell growth in these tumors.Based on our in vitro analysis, we suggest that ALK inhibition may represent an effective therapeutic modality for the treatment of ALK+ RMS. Preclinical studies to confirm or disprove this hypothesis are currently underway.Supported by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and by the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities\"]",

        "Background":"['MYCN is a key driver in initiation and progression of neuroblastoma (NB) and represents a major target for novel drug strategies. We previously reported that the MYC repressor gene HBP1 was down regulated by mutant ALK via the PI3K-AKT-FOXO3 signaling axis1. Here, we further demonstrate that HBP1 upregulation suppresses proliferation of neuroblastoma cells by decreasing the MYCN signaling pathway. HBP1 levels were also shown to be repressed in neuroblastoma cells through MYC/MYCN driven upregulation of the miR-17~92 cluster, indicating that MYCN and mutant ALK both act to inhibit HBP1 expression in NB. Next, we tested the green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), known to upregulate HBP1, and the BET inhibitor JQ1, which represses MYCN activity in neuroblastoma cells, and showed in vitro and in vivo synergistic effects on cell viability and tumor growth. Treatment with the PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor BEZ-235 together with JQ1 also showed very strong synergistic effects. Further dissection of the HBP1 regulome using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and iRegulon analysis (http', '//iregulon.aertslab.org) allowed identification of the PRC2 component SUZ12 as a central node in HBP1 regulated signaling, mainly through controlling the repression of MYCN regulated genes. In keeping with this finding, GSEA analysis of our HBP1 overexpression data set revealed also strong enrichment for genes that are differentially expressed upon EZH2 inhibition in neuroblastoma cells. Because HBP1 has previously been shown to interact with HDAC, we tested the effects of the HDAC inhibitors vorinostat and panobinostat as single agents and in combination with BEZ-235. Both combinations showed a strong synergistic effect on cell viability. The molecular mechanism of this synergism will be explored through RNAseq expression analysis. We conclude that HBP1 is a crucial component in MYCN controlled repression of gene activity through PRC2 interaction and demonstrate novel opportunities for precision drugging of MYCN overexpressing NB cells. 1Lambertz et al.

Despite high response rates, drug-resistant disease often develops in patients. In order to study the mechanisms that underlie resistance, we generated several ALKi-resistant cell lines in vitro.

The established ASP3026-resistant cell lines carry several point mutations in the ALK kinase domain (G1128S, C1156F, I1171N/T, F1174I, N1178H, E1210K, and C1156F/D1203N) that confer resistance to ASP3026 when reintroduced in a Ba/F3 cell model.

        "Background":"['Neuroblastoma (NB), a disease of neural crest (NC) origin, is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood. High-risk NB patients represent the subgroup with the worst prognosis and frequently harbor amplification of MYCN. Due to its biochemical structure as a transcription factor, MYCN has been difficult to target directly with small molecules. Alternatively, identification of cooperating partners of MYCN-induced tumorigenesis can reveal a more therapeutically viable target, such as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). While genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of NB driven by MYCN and ALK exist, recent studies have found significant differences between mouse models of disease and the human tumors they are intended to represent. In support of this, mouse and human NC cells differ in development and marker expression, and the genetic requirement for transformation of human cells has been shown to be more complex than mouse cells, suggesting that a human cell-based NB model would be more relevant. To develop a human cell-based model of NB, we started with a normal human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell line derived integration-free from a healthy adult and transduced empty vector, ALK F1174L (active mutant), doxycycline-inducible MYCN (DOX-MYCN), or ALK F1174L/DOX-MYCN. These iPS cells were differentiated towards NC cells and subsequently implanted orthotopically into renal capsules of mice fed on dox chow. Within 3 months, 60% of mice developed tumors with ALK F1174L/DOX-MYCN, 10% with DOX-MYCN, and 0% with both empty vector and ALK F1174L alone. Tumors were transplantable and demonstrated histologic characteristics consistent with NB, including morphology and expression markers. Thus, we are demonstrating the first, to our knowledge, human stem cell-based model of NB. We are using this system to further investigate similarities and differences with GEMMs of NB, test and establish novel candidate drivers of NB, and evaluate potential therapeutic options.']",

Analysis of recurrent chromosomal aberrations such as losses of 1p, 11q, gain of 1q, 17q and/or MYCN amplification are currently used for patient stratification and definition of therapeutic strategy. Different analysis techniques for detection of segmental abnormalities include FISH, CGH-microarrays or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). However, as next-generation sequencing (NGS) becomes available for clinical use, this could also be used for assessment of copy number alterations simultaneously with mutational analysis. In this study we compare genomic profiles generated through the bioinformatical tool Control-FREEC on Exome sequencing data with profiles generated from Affymetrix 250K or 50K SNP-microarrays on 20 NB tumors of different stages. Exome sequencing was performed by paired-end sequencing on Illumina instrumentation after DNA enrichment with Agilent SureSelect All Exome. The sequencing were performed at three separate occasions with a median raw coverage of 91X, 127X and 340X respectively. Neuroblastoma tumors were normalized with either corresponding constitutional DNA or normal control DNA for NGS data while microarrays were normalized against healthy control DNA. Gross genomic changes were extracted through visual and/or ratio inspection from 20 neuroblastoma tumors. A total of 128 larger segmental aberrations and 63 numerical aneuploidies were detected trough SNP-microarrays. Discrepancies between the two methods were detected in three cases; one segmental loss detected through microarray could not be confirmed by NGS-profiling, one smaller deletion were only detected through NGS-profiling and in one instance both methods indicated 2p-gain but at different positions. Otherwise the results were concordant. Furthermore, through exome sequencing data were we also able to detect ALK mutations in four patients, ATRX-deletions in two patients and chromothripsis of chromosome 5 in one patient. In conclusion, exome sequencing could be used as a new diagnostic tool for neuroblastoma tumors combining mutational screening with detection of common chromosomal and segmental aneuploidies such as 2p-gain, 17q-gain, 11q-deletion as well as MYCN-amplification and alterations of ALK or ATRX.']",

Although NSCs can be enriched in neurosphere floating culture with serum-free media containing EGF/FGF as a classical method, neurosphere is composed of not only NSCs but also differentiated and apoptotic cells. Therefore, we utilize the method for efficient derivation of NSCs with long-term self-renewal and differentiate capacity in adherent culture. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase first identified in a chromosomal translocation associated with anaplastic large cell lymphomas. Subsequently, new ALK translocations were found in a fraction of non-small-cell lung cancers and in other solid tumors. The function of full-length ALK is involved in neuronal cell differentiation, regeneration and synapse formation. Recently, gene amplification and mutations of full-length ALK were identified in neuroblastoma. Furthermore, it is reported that ALK and PTN, ligand of ALK, are required for maintenance of the stem cell population in GBM. Although constitutive activation of ALK signaling results in cell transformation, little is known about the tumorigenic mechanisms induced by activated ALK. We reasoned that ALK activity has a crucial role in GBM. To verify this hypothesis, human GBM stem cell lines were treated with crizotinib, ALK inhibitor. Crizotinib could suppress the proliferation of human GBM stem cell lines in dose-dependent-manner. Next, we have established a stable mouse model of brain tumor transplanting the genetically modified NSCs. Active mutant of H-RAS could transform the Ink4a/Arf KO NSCs but not WT NSCs. However, transplanting of WT NSCs transduced activated ALK could rapidly formed highly proliferative and invasive brain tumors. Histological characteristics of these tumors resembled human GBM phenotype demonstrating necrosis, perivascular cuffing and giant cell formation. Although the activated H-RAS increased expression of Ink4a in WT NSCs, but the activated ALK never changed. On the basis of these findings, we propose a specific regulation against tumor suppressor genes by activated ALK.']",

We developed a second generation CAR based on a monoclonal antibody against ALK. ALK CAR T-cells significantly delay the growth of human NB cell lines in murine xenograft models, but animals eventually succumb to tumors.In order to understand how target antigen density limits the effectiveness of this CAR, we created a library of NALM-6 B-cell leukemias with variable amounts of ALK expressed on the surface of each clone. In vitro, ALK CAR T-cells lyse high ALK expressing leukemias but have reduced activity against leukemias with low expression of ALK. In co-culture assays, we found that there is a minimum target antigen density required for CAR T-cells to produce appreciable amounts of Th1 cytokines. This threshold of ALK expression is above the expression on human NB lines. There is also a threshold target antigen density at which maximum cytokine production occurs. Above this density, no additional cytokines are produced. In xenograft models, ALK CAR T-Cells are significantly more effective against high ALK expressing leukemia than against low ALK expressing leukemia. To our knowledge, this is the first report of greater in vivo efficacy of CAR T-cells against tumors with higher antigen expression.The level of surface expression of the CAR on T-cells also alters the function of CAR T-cells. We have identified a phenomenon in which both ALK and CD19 CAR T-cells lose surface expression of CAR over time in culture. Additionally, both the ALK CAR and the CD19 CAR downregulate quickly after T-cells are exposed to antigen. Using a fluorescently tagged CD19 CAR, we demonstrate that CARs are rapidly internalized upon antigen encounter.We created an assay to understand the interplay of target density and CAR surface expression. We transduced T-cells with different amounts of supernatant to achieve different ALK CAR surface densities and then exposed these T-cells to varying amounts of immobilized protein-L in order to crosslink the CAR. T-cell activation (measured by an NFAT reporter) is greatest when both CAR surface expression and target antigen density are highest. As both variables are decreased, there is a significant loss of T-cell activity. Thus, diminished CAR surface density due to antigen-dependent and independent CAR downmodulation may limit CAR T-cell efficacy, especially in the context of low tumor antigen expression.In conclusion, we have created a novel CAR targeting ALK that demonstrates in vivo efficacy against NB. Efficacy is limited by low target antigen density on NB and low CAR surface expression. We have identified phenomena in which CAR T-cells lose surface expression of CAR over time and also quickly internalize their receptors in response to antigen. These factors contribute to the efficacy of other CAR T-cells and this data provides important insights into future CAR target selection.']",

A recent study comparing the genetic profiles of tumors from 23 NB patients before and after disease relapse showed that relapsed tumors have a higher percentage of targetable mutations, particularly in the ALK/RAS/MAPK pathway [Eleveld et al. Nat Gen 2015]. We performed a retrospective study to further define the genetic landscape of diagnostic and relapsed NB. A total of 151 NB samples from 11 institutions were submitted for targeted sequencing of 236 genes commonly mutated in cancer using the FoundationOne assay; 40 at diagnosis, 67 at disease relapse, and 38 during primary therapy (i.e. second look surgery). Three patients were biopsied at both diagnosis and disease relapse. Patients were included in the study based solely on the availability of FoundationOne data. We identified 38 unique genes with known oncogenic mutations in this cohort. Of these, ALK was the most prevalent, with mutations occurring in 13.8% of patients, and there was a higher frequency of known oncogenic ALK mutations in relapsed disease (17% of patients) than at diagnosis (7.7% of patients). Further, there were more unique genes with known oncogenic mutations or gene amplifications in relapsed disease (25 mutated, 7 amplified) than at diagnosis (14 mutated, 2 amplified). Patients with relapsed disease were more likely to have at least one known mutation or gene amplification (60% vs. 41% of patients, P = 0.07).

        "Background":"['Neuroblastoma is known to exhibit wide ranges of clinical phenotypes, from spontaneous regression to highly resistant to chemotherapy. One of the challenges in the clinic is to develop suitable therapeutic strategies for the intermediate risk-type of patients (stage 3 or 4 without MYCN amplification) whose prognosis sometimes tends to be poor in terms of long-term follow-up (10 years survival rate was 51% in our database, n = 161). To identify key biological pathways involved in the unfavorable phenotypes in this patient group, we have analyzed 63 primary tumors (dead', '32, alive', '31) without MYCN amplification nor ALK alteration by integrated genomic analyses such as array CGH, whole exome sequencing (SureSelect XT Human All Exon V4, average read depth', '157, x20 coverage', '95%), RNA sequencing, as well as Methylome profiling (Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip). By using the Karkinos and ANNOVAR software, we found so far 816 non-synonymous somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in coding exons in total (approximately 20 per tumor in average) and number of alterations in each tumor strongly correlated with age at diagnosis (p<0.0001) and patient prognosis (p = 0.0077). Recurrent somatic SNVs (n = 2 to n = 5) were found in 66 genes, 19 of those were involved only in the tumors from the 24 patients with poor outcome. Gene Ontology and pathway analysis (GeneMANIA) using the 66 genes showed that mutations occurred in the features including cytoskeleton, ion channel and extracellular matrix were significantly correlated with patient survival of the 63 MYCN-non-amplified tumors with logrank p-values of 0.0039, 0.0482 and 0.0011, respectively. ATRX mutations were observed in four tumors (6.3%), all of them were occurred in patients with unfavorable phenotypes (3 dead, 1 alive but relapsed twice). By methylome signature, the 63 tumors were subdivided into at least three clusters, which also showed strong correlation with patient prognosis (cluster-1 vs. cluster-2 and -3, p = 0.0368). Unfavorable cluster-2 and -3 exhibited hyper-methylation phenotypes in CpG islands and the former was quite similar to that of MYCN-amplified tumors. Thus, these prognosis-related genomic features could be useful markers for risk classification and help understanding molecular mechanism for aggressive phenotypes of MYCN-non-amplified neuroblastomas.']",

        "Background":"['Despite improvement of survival using multimodal chemo- and immunotherapy, high mortality and morbidity is still substantial for pediatric patients with metastatic cancers. Recent large-scale sequencing studies of pediatric tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and neuroblastoma (NB) have been focusing on somatic mutations, and revealed a low somatic mutation rate and surprisingly few recurrently somatic mutated genes in these childhood tumors. Currently, only a small portion of pediatric cancer cases can be explained by somatic driver events; whereas the cause for the majority of these diseases remains unknown. Because both these two types of tumors are uncommon, here we hypothesize that infrequent germline mutations (frequency<0.05 in control populations) may play a role in the initiation of sporadically occurring tumor.To test this hypothesis, we utilized sequencing data from two cancer patient cohorts consisting of RMS (n=133) and NB (n=222) patients, of which latter is a part of the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) initiative for pediatric cancers. First, high-quality protein-coding changing single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were called in both paired germline and tumor genomic DNAs. Then we excluded common variants with frequency >5% in a normal human population using the 1000 Genomes data. Due to our interest in the enriched variants, we further required the frequencies of variants in our rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma patient cohorts are higher than those in the ESP dataset, a non-cancer control population comprising 6503 individuals. There are 63247 SNVs fulfilled these selection criteria. Among them, 1589 have been reported in these pediatric cancers or in other malignancies in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project; and 1178 variants are present in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). Of these HGMD variants, 49 have been reported in human diseases and 34 of them are known disease-causing mutations for human cancers and genetic disorders including TP53, ALK, CHEK2, and PINK1. Interestingly, the most frequent germline mutations in these pediatric tumors were rarely found in the TCGA project which mostly consists of adult cancers. This observation suggests a very different genetic background of pediatric cancer patients from that of the adult cancers, and warrants a careful examination of germline mutations in these cancers. Furthermore, previous studies have highlighted the importance of expression of variant genes (including tumor suppressor genes) for identification of driver mutations in cancers. Therefore we will use 178 transcriptome sequencing experiments available for these tumors (RMS=84; NB=93) to identify expressed variants in tumor. Statistical and pathway analyses are currently underway to determine potential pathological or casual germline mutations associated with neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma.']",

This can be achieved by studying specific regions using targeted or amplicon sequencing, and thereby reducing the complexity of the analysis. The main benefits of this approach are reduced costs and shorter analysis time, due to the sequencing of fewer bases and the associated reduction in the volume of data generated. Additional benefit comes from achieving higher coverage that provides means for detection tumor specific variants present at subclonal level.The HaloPlex method, the custom target enrichment kit from Agilent, uses a different approach among enrichment kits, namely the fragmentation of DNA by restriction enzymes in conjunction with biotinylated probes designed to hybridize to both ends of a targeted DNA restriction fragment. This will form circular DNA strands that will be then closed by ligation (http', '//www.genomics.agilent.com) and it requires only 250 ng of input material. We targeted 35kb of genomic sequence including exons of related genes, as well as 50 bp of flanking exon regions. Samples were sequenced in a single MiSeq run (Illumina) using 2150 paired-end sequencing.We compiled a gene panel for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) comprising of three genes, ALK, ATRX and PPM1D, where the two first are associated with different subgroups of NBs. The Haloplex panel was evaluated on a pilot cohort of 40 patients including four controls with known and defined mutations (missense and indels), which produced a total of 4 Gb of data. Data were analyzed using an in-house bioinformatics pipeline based on mapping reads against hg19 using bwa, with realignment and recalibration using GATK haplotype caller, and variant annotation using ANNOVAR. For each position, the frequency for each base was calculated. The analysis revealed that we were able to generate sufficient sequencing data with very low background variability for mutation as well as deletion analysis using our diagnostic panels. We identified all expected mutations in our control samples. Sanger sequencing were used to validate the results and for analyzing sensitivity and specificity of the detected variants.Overall, the panel fulfills diagnostic criteria and will offer a fast and reliable procedure that will be useful in clarifying molecular genetic defects underlying NBs.']",

Most NBs take up the norepinephrine analogue 131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) that is used radiologically to stage disease. Results from a Children's Oncology Group HR NB trial showed patients with MIBG positive NB at diagnosis had worse overall survival compared to patients with MIBG negative NB (3 year OS\", ' 65% vs 85%; Parisi 2010) but biologically we do not know why. MIBG (-) NBs are more undifferentiated pathologically and often fail to secrete the catecholamines HVA and VMA. We hypothesized that MIBG (-) and MIBG (+) HR NBs arise at different stages of neuroblast development and thus harbor different gene expression profiles that affect therapy response. We interrogated published microarrays (GSE19724, GSE3960) of primary HR NBs for gene expression changes based on norepinephrine transporter (NET) expression as NBs take up MIBG through this neural transporter. Twenty-one genes had > 3-fold significant change in expression based on NET expression. Genes involved in neural development (ALK, PHOX2B, TLX2, DBH, DDC) were significantly decreased in NET low NBs, supporting our hypothesis. NET low NBs also had a >3-fold increase in COUP-TF1, a transcription factor necessary for retinoic acid (RA) induced differentiation in some cancers. COUP-TF1s role in NB is unknown. Microarrays containing prognostic data confirmed HR NBs with medium/high COUP-TF1 expression had superior patient survival compared to those with low COUP-TF1, independent of NET (p=.0004, http', '//home.ccr.cancer.gov/oncology/oncogenomics). In vitro, NB cell lines with high COUP-TF1 protein (SMS-SAN) were very sensitive to RA induced differentiation and shRNA inhibition of COUP-TF1 in SMS-SAN caused RA resistance. Similarly, overexpression of COUP-TF1 restored RA sensitivity in RA resistant, low COUP-TF1 expressing IMR5. RA treatment increased COUP-TF1 expression in NB coincident with RAR induction, suggesting COUP-TF1 is critical to RA response. shRNA inhibition of COUP-TF1 (shCOUP) rendered SMS-SAN resistant to doxorubicin, with SMS-SAN-shCOUP growing in doxorubicin doses that killed > 70% of wild type SMS-SAN, suggesting COUP-TF1 is necessary for cytotoxic response as well. We have identified a transcription factor that is associated with improved patient survival and in vitro studies suggest this is through mediation of therapy response. COUP-TF1 enhances RA induced differentiation in NB and we are the first to show COUP-TF1 also mediates cytotoxic response in cancer. This supports using COUP-TF1 as a biomarker for therapy response to improve risk stratification and treatment choice in HR NB.

IHC staining revealed that NPY accumulated intracellularly in differentiating and maturing cells, while in undifferentiated NBs a significant amount of the peptide was observed in extracellular spaces, suggesting its free release. In line with this observation, serum concentrations of NPY were higher in the subset of NB patients with undifferentiated and poorly differentiated tumors, as compared to those with differentiating NBs (p-value = 0.03). High serum concentrations of NPY strongly correlated with several adverse prognostic factors (Stage 4, high risk, diploidy, and unfavorable histology) (p-value<0.03) and worse survival (p-value<0.04). 2) Y2R was expressed mainly in undifferentiated NB cells. mRNA of this receptor was detectable in 100% of cases and its levels positively correlated with MYCN expression 3) mRNA of Y5R was detectable in 84% of tumors assessed and correlated with expression of BDNF and its TrkB receptor, factors associated with poor prognosis. High Y5R protein levels marked a population of invasive NB cells.This study validated NPY and its receptors as targets for NB therapy. Serum NPY was the most highly prognostic variable, found to be associated with five NB prognostic factors. Higher NPY levels were correlated with a more detrimental disease phenotype.\"]",

        "Meeting_name":" Characterization of a novel series of potent, selective inhibitors of wild type and mutant/fusion anaplastic lymphoma kinase",
        "Background":"['Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase that has been implicated as a driving oncogene in a number of cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), neuroblastoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT). Numerous genetic aberrations at the ALK locus are observed in cancer including point mutations, amplifications, translocations and inversions. Inversions are exemplified by inv(2)(p21;p23), which leads to the constitutively active oncogenic fusion protein EML4-ALK present in 5% of NSCLC. Crizotinib, a dual cMet/ALK kinase inhibitor, was recently approved by the FDA for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that is ALK-positive, thereby validating ALK as therapeutic target. Here we describe the pharmacological characterization of a novel series of potent, selective and orally bioavailable ALK kinase inhibitors. Members of this series inhibit wild type ALK, NPM-ALK fusion and crizotinib resistant ALK[L1196M] kinase activity at sub-nanomolar concentrations, displaying up to 200 fold increased inhibitory activity over crizotinib. Kinase profiling indicate that members of this series display increased selectivity scores relative crizotinib. In Karpas-299 cells, selected compounds inhibited both pY1604 ALK activation (IC50 = 2 nM) and cell proliferation (IC50 = 1 nM). Members of this series were also evaluated in the EML4-ALK expressing NSCLC cell line H3122, and displayed equipotent inhibition of pY1604 ALK activation and inhibition of cell proliferation (both IC50 = 1 nM). Members of this class did not inhibit growth of an ALK negative lymphoma cell line (HT). The in vivo activity of this series was examined in the Karpas-299 ALCL xenograft model. Compound was dosed daily (PO) at 10, 30 and 60 mg/kg. Tumor growth inhibition was observed at all dose levels, and the highest dose level resulted in significant tumor regression (96%, p<0.0001) without weight loss. The inhibition of pY1604 ALK was evaluated in these tumors (8 hrs post dose); >80% pALK inhibition was observed at the lowest doses tested, and complete inhibition was seen at doses of 30 mg/kg and above. In a direct comparison, members of this series achieved ALK inhibition in these tumors at a 15 fold lower plasma concentration than crizotinib. A PK/PD time course study was performed in the Karpas-299 model. A single 60 mg/kg dose of an inhibitor was able to maintain >90% ALK inhibition in tumors up to 24 hours post-dose, indicating significant tumor penetration and sustained ALK kinase inhibition. In conclusion, the described compounds are potent and selective inhibitors of ALK kinase, possess an impressive efficacy profile and drug-like pharmacokinetic properties. These features together indicate the potential for significant advantages over crizotinib. There is a compelling case for their clinical evaluation in patients with ALK-driven cancers.']",

        "Background":"['CD19 directed Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have shown clinical responses against B cell malignancies. However, CARs targeting other tumor-associated antigens have been less successful. Factors limiting CAR efficacy are not well understood. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a cell-surface protein overexpressed in a large fraction of neuroblastomas, the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood. We constructed MSGV1.ALK.BBZ retroviral vectors using single-chain variable fragment (scFv) sequences from murine monoclonal antibodies targeting ALK and transduced these into human PBMCs. ALK-CAR T cells lysed ALK+ tumor lines, but produced limited amounts of IFN-g and IL-2 upon co-culture with ALK+ tumor cells compared to CD19-CARs co-cultured with CD19+ targets. In order to identify potential differences between ALK-CAR and CD19-CAR induced signaling we employed a reporter system in which GFP expression was directed by an NFAT-responsive promoter and could be visualized by flow cytometry. T cells were co-transduced with lentiviral NFAT-GFP and MSGV1.ALK.BBZ or MSGV1.CD19.BBZ. Transduced T cells were co-cultured with tumor lines expressing ALK or CD19 antigen. GFP expression was induced within 4h of antigen exposure in double transduced T cells and persisted for at least 24h. The magnitude of GFP expression correlated positively with antigen density on tumor targets. Additionally, >50% of GFP+ cells retained CD19-CAR surface expression after antigen encounter. However, we observed drastically reduced surface ALK-CAR expression on GFP+ T cells after encounter with tumor targets. Upon further examination, we noticed that ALK-CARs were down-modulated from the T cell surface within 1h of exposure to antigen, and remained internalized for at least 24h. The magnitude of NFAT translocation in ALK-CAR T cells, as measured by GFP intensity, was also markedly lower than the magnitude of NFAT translocation in CD19-CAR T cells. These results suggest that limited numbers of CARs remaining on the T cell surface after initial antigen encounter may contribute to diminished ALK-CAR T cell efficacy, possibly by preventing temporal summation of repeated CAR signaling. Work is underway to prevent CAR down-modulation after antigen encounter, and to evaluate the impact of increased surface CAR retention on CAR functionality. In summary, optimal design of new CAR therapeutics requires a better understanding of essential factors limiting CAR efficacy. Through evaluation of a novel CAR targeting ALK, we have identified CAR down-modulation as one factor that may influence CAR-T efficacy, and may be amenable to modulation in order to improve CAR functionality.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' The purpose of this study was to develop a novel approach for isolation and genetic analysis of individual circulating and disseminated tumor cells (CTC, DTC) from patient samples. This work is motivated by our desire to develop non-invasive molecular diagnostics and understand single tumor cell heterogeneity.Methods', ' Here we used the DEPArray microelectronics and microfluidics platform for the manipulation and capture of individual tumor cells. A suspension of live or fixed cells, prelabeled with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies, was loaded into the DEPArray cartridge, and application of non-uniform electrical fields (dielectrophoresis) was employed to trap individual cells into movable micro-cages. Cell images were acquired via the incorporated fluorescence microscope and CCD camera, and cells were selected based on morphology and expression of tumor antigens. To determine sensitivity and specificity of the capture process, cell lines were spiked into normal donor white blood cells (WBC) over a 5-log range. Pre-enrichment by FACSAria was employed when the starting tumor cell concentration was below 1 in 1,000 WBC. The whole genome amplification (WGA) product of single cells was then subjected to targeted sequencing. To apply this approach to patient samples, we obtained blood and bone marrow samples from patients with refractory high-risk neuroblastoma, a cancer with a high rate and quantity of distant metastatic disease.Results', \" Single tumor cells were recovered from all spiking experiments, including spiked samples with a tumor cell concentration as low as 1 in 106 WBC. Recovery of EpCAM-negative single cells was accomplished with the neuroblastoma cell lines SY5Y, NB1643, and Kelly labeled with an antibody for the disialoganglioside GD2, the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 with a HER2 antibody, and for the lung cancer cell line H292 with EGFR labeling. Recovery of EpCAM-positive cells was achieved with the colon carcinoma cell line SW480. Captured single cells were WGA'd and specificity was verified using Sanger sequencing. For the 2 neuroblastoma spiking experiments for which sequencing has been completed, the known ALK mutation (F1174L) was detected in 100% of cells. The known KRAS mutation (G12V) was detected in 100% of single SW480 cells sequenced to date. No mutations were detected in isolated WBC. We next analyzed the post-Ficoll fraction of 12 patient bone marrow and 1 patient blood sample, with a median tumor cell concentration of 0.119% (range 0.003 - 80.0%). A minimum of 10 single tumor cells were captured per patient. Genome-wide analysis of DNA and RNA copy number and mutation status from these samples is ongoing.Conclusion\", ' These data demonstrate the development of a novel workflow for the reliable capture and genetic analysis of rare CTC. Efforts are ongoing to join this approach with a more comprehensive genome-wide analysis of single cells from neuroblastoma and other cancers.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Contemporary chemotherapy-based regimens provide cures for most pediatric & AYA cancers. However, for patients with relapsed/refractory malignancies, outcomes are poor & imply a distinct and aggressive biology. Identifying common themes in the molecular architecture & oncogenic mechanisms in these patients is a critical priority for drug development. We hypothesized that the molecular signature of cancers in these patients would be independent of histology. We also assessed the response to molecular alteration (MA)-targeted therapies. Methods', ' IRB-approved analysis of MAs in 306 relapsed/refractory pediatric & AYA malignancies (116 hematologic malignancies, 68 sarcomas, 46 neuroblastomas, 36 CNS, 14 liver, 9 renal, 17 other) was performed. DNA was analyzed for MAs (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA; Univ of Washington, Seattle, WA); additional MAs were identified by cytogenetic & fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses. Results', ' Median age was 8 years (range birth - 44 yrs). MAs were identified in 90.1% of patients & included a median of 2 mutations (range 0-18) in 133 cancer-related genes. In contrast to genomic analyses of de novo malignancies in children, a high frequency of TP53 MAs was identified (20.4% of patients) and was associated with inferior survival. MAs were identified in targetable pathways including cell cycle regulation (32.6%), DNA repair (7.2%), epigenetic (28.6%), RAS/RAF/MEK (24%), tyrosine kinase (TK; 18.4%), PI3K/AKT/mTOR (11.8%), and NOTCH/WNT (8.9%). A higher number of MAs was associated with inferior survival. Patients with alterations in epigenetic & TK pathways also had inferior outcomes. MAs were frequently independent of histology & the spectrum of mutations was similar to adult cancers. Exceptional responses were observed with MA-based assignment of therapies (epigenetic, NTRK, RAS/RAF/MEK & ALK). Conclusions', ' Relapsed/refractory pediatric & AYA cancers have frequent MAs independent of histology. The spectrum of MAs is distinct from de novo disease & potentially reflects tumor evolution & resistance mechanisms. These findings support MA-guided approaches to new drug development paired with adult trials.']",
