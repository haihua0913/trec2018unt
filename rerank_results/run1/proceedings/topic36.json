There are now four germline mutations in lung cancer oncogenes (EGFR T790M, V843I, R776H; and ERBB2 G660D) which have been reported in kindreds with a high prevalence of lung cancer in nonsmokers. We hypothesized that routine tumor NGS could be used to find rare kindreds with inherited lung cancer risk. Methods', ' An institute-wide database of tumor NGS results was queried for cases positive for one of the reported germline risk alleles in EGFR or ERBB2. At our center, tumor NGS is performed using a hybrid-capture platform spanning exons and key introns of ~400 cancer related genes, and is available for patients (pts) with consent to a research protocol. For living pts with a mutation detected at an allelic fraction (AF) > 25%, and excluding acquired T790M, genetic counseling and CLIA germline testing was provided. For pts with EGFR T790M, testing was performed on the INHERIT EGFR study (NCT01754025; ALCMI). Results', ' 51 cases were identified from a total of 13,488 cancers with NGS results', ' 45 with EGFR T790M (all lung cancer), 4 with EGFR R776H (NSCLC, endometrial cancer, and 2 glioma), 2 with ERBB2 G660D (NSCLC and glioblastoma). 34 pts with T790M detected after EGFR inhibitor were excluded, leaving 17 pts of interest. Germline testing was performed on 9 living pts with > 25% AF on NGS, and was positive in 8; 6 of these had germline EGFR T790M. Additionally, germline EGFR R776H was found in a never-smoker with metastatic endometrial cancer; she had a prior a history of NSCLC, and family history was notable for multiple members with lung, breast, and colon cancer. Germline ERBB2 G660D was found in a young never-smoker with metastatic NSCLC and a family history significant for lung cancer in multiple first-degree relatives. Conclusions', ' Rare germline lung cancer risk mutations in EGFR and ERBB2 can be identified on routine tumor NGS, and may indicate a risk of inherited lung cancer. Our study includes the second known report of a germline EGFR R776H or ERBB2 G660D mutations. Commercial germline NGS assays could be expanded to cover these rare but potentially high-penetrance variants.']",

        "Background":"['Background', '  Amplification of the ERBB2 (HER2) gene is a well-known genetic aberration in many tumor entities. Up to 20% of breast and gastric cancer show ERBB2 gene amplification and anti-HER2 targeting therapies are well established for these tumors. In other tumor entities such as lung cancer, colorectal cancer and bladder cancer the fraction of ERBB2 amplified tumors is considerably lower. In contrast to breast cancer, these tumors show heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification in a substantial proportion. Oncogenic EGFR mutation with subsequent EGFR amplification is a common phenomenon in lung cancer. In analogy, primary ERBB2 mutation could explain the observed heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification in some tumors. Methods', '  100 tumors showing ERBB2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization were examined for ERBB2 mutation', ' 50 breast cancer samples, including 10 cases with borderline gene amplification, 10 cases with heterogeneous gene amplification and 11 samples of metastatic lesions as well as 15 colorectal carcinomas, 12 gastric carcinomas, 12 non-small cell lung cancers and 10 urothelial carcinomas. Tumor DNA was extracted and examined for mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (exons 18-23) of the ERBB2 gene by Sanger sequencing. Results', '  ERBB2 mutation was found in two metastatic lesions of breast cancer, two lung cancers and two colorectal cancers. In five of these cases short in-frame insertions in exon 20 were found. In one case of a breast cancer lung metastasis a missense mutation in exon 19 (p.L755S) was detected. The semi-quantitative chromatograms show an overrepresentation of the mutations indicating a selective amplification of the mutated allele. Conclusions', '  In certain tumor entities the heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification indicates a late genetic event. The finding of a concomitant mutation in ERBB2 amplified tumors might explain the heterogeneity in some of these tumors. The effect of a primary oncogenic ERBB2 mutation might be increased by selective amplification of the mutated allele resulting in an additional growth advantage.

        "Background":"['The ERBB2 receptor tyrosine kinase gene is frequently amplified and mutated in human cancer. However, mutations characterized to date have been located in the kinase domain of the receptor. Using publically-available sequencing datasets, we have found that extracellular domain mutations of ERBB2 located beneath the dimerization arm recur in lung, breast, and ovarian cancers. We expressed cDNAs harboring these mutations in NIH-3T3 cells and found that the mutants support anchorage-independent proliferation. We furthermore found that substitution of any one of a number of amino acids in this region of the protein is oncogenic. We sought to biochemically characterize the extracellular domain mutations of ERBB2 and found that they cause oncogenic transformation by one of two mechanisms', ' elevation of C-terminal tail phosphorylation, or reduction-sensitive covalent dimerization unaccompanied by increases in C-terminal phosphorylation. Analysis of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in the cell by stable isotope labeling followed by mass spectrometry (SILAC) revealed that both classes of mutant receptor phosphorylated the same set of proteins to effect transformation. The most prominent targets were proteins involved in cytoskeletal and membrane dynamics, controlling cell motility. STAT3 was also phosphorylated to a limited extent in ERBB2-transformed cells. Interestingly, STAT3 phosphorylation was mediated solely by a JAK-dependent autocrine loop in cells transformed by the ERBB2 mutants activated by reduction-sensitive dimerization; whereas both ERBB2 and JAK family kinases contributed to STAT3 phosphorylation in cells transformed by ERBB2 mutants exhibiting increased C-terminal phosphorylation. In order to characterize inhibitor sensitivity, we transformed Ba/F3 cells to IL-3 independence with the ERBB2 extracellular domain mutants. All extracellular domain mutants tested were sensitive to irreversible inhibitors of ERBB2, suggesting that treatment with such inhibitors may benefit patients harboring mutations of the extracellular domain of ERBB2.']",

        "Background":"['Breast cancers display a remarkable phenotypic diversity that is exploited to promote both tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Recent studies in several types of cancer have highlighted the significance of intratumoral heterogeneity on both innate and acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Tumor plasticity is supported by the heterogeneous expression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the robustness that the overlapping signaling networks provide. Therefore a thorough understanding of the intratumoral heterogeneity is necessary for the development of effective therapeutic strategies.The receptor tyrosine kinase MET is overexpressed in 20-30% of breast cancers and correlates with poor patient outcome. Previously, we determined that high MET expression correlated with ERneg/ERBB2neg and basal-like breast cancers. These results and the efficacy of MET inhibitors in other cancers suggest that MET may be an effective clinical target for aggressive breast cancer subtypes. Recent studies have exposed interactions between MET and the ERBB receptor family in the progression and therapeutic resistance of several cancers. Since MET, ERBB2, and EGFR are known to be highly expressed in aggressive breast cancer subtypes, it is critical that we understand the relationships between these receptors in order to develop effective treatment strategies.In this study, we interrogated the relationship between MET expression/activity and the expression/activity of the ERBB receptor family in human breast cancers and a breast cancer cell line. Using coimmunostaining and quantitative multispectral analysis, we observed that a significant percentage of ERBB2+ tumors coexpress MET and ERBB2. These tumors display significant heterogeneity and have subpopulations of cells that are METhigh/ERBB2low, METlow/ERBB2high, and METhigh/ERBB2high. In a METhigh/ERBB2high breast cancer cell line, we observed that MET depletion results in increased ERBB2 activation and conversely ERBB2 depletion results in increase MET activation. Neither EGFR or ERBB3 compensated for MET or ERBB2 knockdown. The loss of both MET and ERBB2 led to a decrease in PI3K/AKT signaling and increased dependency on MAPK. MET and ERBB2 knockdown did decrease proliferation but neither alone was able to abolish all cell growth. These results in addition to the heterogeneous expression of MET and ERBB2 in breast cancers have significant clinical implications on potential therapeutic strategies for breast cancer patients.']",

These driver mutations are not captured with IHC or FISH staining because in the majority of cases, the ERBB2 gene is not amplified and HER2 protein is not overexpressed. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) provides a non-invasive means of identifying these potential driver mutations.Method', ' Guardant360TM is a targeted cfDNA NGS panel using hybrid capture and complete exon sequencing for single nucleotide variant detection in 70 genes, copy number amplifications (CNA) in 16 genes, and fusions in six genes and indels in EGFR, ERBB2 and MET exon 14 skipping. De-identified pathology and genotyping reports were reviewed for consecutive patients in which ERBB2 indels were identified in clinical practice.Results', ' Guardant360 identified ERBB2 indels in 27 of 2,093 (1.3%) of non-squamous NSCLC cases, with a single concomitant ERBB2 gene amplification. For this ERBB2 indel series, pathology reports revealed no patients with HER2 amplification via IHC or FISH, nor ERBB2 point mutation via NGS, but were only available in 25% of cases. Eight of the ERBB2 indels were confirmed by tissue NGS reports with zero false positives (100% PPV). 80% of ERBB2 indels were the common p.Tyr772_Ala775dup (YVMA insertion) in exon 20 followed by other insertions in codons 772 through 814. A single ERBB2 exon 20 p.Leu755_Glu757delinsProLys net deletion at 3.9% mutant allele fration (MAF) was noted in one patient, for whom outcome data was available. Initial tissue was IHC negative for HER2 overexpression at the referring hospital where the archival tissue biopsy was exhausted and so could not be sequenced. Based on the cfDNA finding of ERBB2 indel, the patient was switched from cytotoxic chemotherapy to trastuzumab with objective response on PET/CT and a repeat Guardant360 showed the ERBB2 indel MAF had dropped below the test limit of detection.

        "Background":"['DNA copy number amplification at the ERBB2 locus on 17q12-21 is a frequent genomic event, present in 10-15% of breast tumors. This gene-dense amplicon contains several genes that are aberrantly overexpressed in ERBB2+ breast cancer. We hypothesized that a subset of amplicon genes with minimal expression in normal tissue could serve as candidates for shared tumor-specific antigens. We eliminated from consideration other amplicon genes with high expression in specific tissues or broad expression in normal tissues due to the potential for autoimmune toxicity. Immunohistochemistry of a breast tumor microarray showed expression of MIEN, GRB7, PGAP3 proteins specifically in ERBB2+ tumor cells but not in stroma or in ERBB2 non-amplified breast tumor samples. We tested several peptide epitopes with predicted high affinity for HLA-A2 (<50 nM) and confirmed that these could stabilize MHC expression on T2 cells. In vitro sensitization of normal donor lymphocytes with the predicted epitopes led to production of IFN-. Moreover, Dendritic cells pulsed with lysate from SKBR3 (ERBB2 amplified) but not MCF7 breast cancer cells could sensitize autologous lymphocytes to epitopes from amplicon proteins. This suggests that the natural abundance of the amplicon proteins in ERBB2 positive tumors is sufficient to provide cross-priming. To test whether the amplicon proteins could serve as tumor-rejection antigens we used the murine TM15 breast cancer cell line which has amplification of a syntenic region surrounding the murine Her2/neu gene. Quantitative PCR showed 50-fold overexpression of the amplicon gene pnmt in TM15 cells. Mice vaccinated with recombinant murine or human PNMT protein, but not ovalbumin, rejected challenge with TM15 tumor without any overt toxicity and developed memory against delayed re-challenge.These data indicate that normal host genes which are in immediate proximity to the oncogene ERBB2 are abnormally expressed at high levels in ERBB2+ breast tumor cells. Although the molecular mechanism leading to aberrant expression is unknown, analysis of several breast cancer microarray databases as well as TCGA data also show a very high correlation between ERBB2 overexpression and high expression of these passenger genes so this seems to be a general phenomenon. T lymphocytes normally have tolerance to non-mutated host proteins however tolerance can be reversed with proper sensitization conditions. Antigen overexpression in tumor cells might allow effector T cells to surpass an activation threshold while preserving tolerance for normal tissue. DNA copy number amplification of specific oncogenes is a frequent genomic event in cancer so the general strategy of targeting passenger genes on amplicons may have broader use in cancer immunotherapy.']",

Overexpression of the HER2/ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase in breast cancer is associated with metastatic disease and correlates with poor patient prognosis. Growing evidence demonstrates that TGF can potentiate ErbB2 signaling to enhance the invasive and metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying the synergy between TGF and ErbB2 signaling pathways remain to be elucidated.We previously identified Lipoma Preferred Partner (LPP) as an indispensable mediator of TGF-induced migration, invasion and focal adhesion turnover of ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we established domains within LPP that are required for its localization to focal adhesions and for its interaction with -Actinin, an actin cross-linking protein, to promote cell migration and invasion.Herein, we examine the requirement of LPP in tumorigenesis and metastasis formation. We observe that LPP is dispensable for primary tumor growth. Nonetheless, the loss of LPP leads to decrease in spontaneous lung metastasis formation of ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells injected into the mammary fat pads of mice. Furthermore, we observe that LPP is a critical determinant for efficient dissemination of breast cancer cells. We show that shRNA-mediated reduction of LPP significantly impairs pulmonary metastasis formation in experimental metastasis tail vein assay.Overall, we have identified LPP as a novel mediator that integrates TGF and ErbB2 signaling to promote the migration, invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells. We identify LPP as a pro-metastatic mediator of ErbB2 overexpressing breast cancer cells and a potential new biomarker of metastatic breast cancer.']",

        "Background":"['ARRY-380 is an orally active, potent small molecule targeting ErbB2 inhibitor currently in clinical development in patients with ErbB2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC). This compound has shown excellent activity in numerous SC mouse tumor models including breast (BT-474, MDA-MB-453), ovarian (SK-OV-3) and gastric (N87) carcinoma models. In breast cancer patients, brain metastases are a serious unmet medical need. Patients with ErbB2+ breast cancer have a significantly increased incidence of brain metastases following trastuzumab therapy. Here we demonstrate significant single agent activity of ARRY-380 in two ErbB2+ intracranial mouse xenograft models. For these studies, female nude mice received intracranial implantations of tumor cells (either NCI-N87 or BT-474) by direct injection into the brain parenchyma (via the sagittal suture). In pilot studies, we demonstrated that the blood brain barrier was not disrupted by mechanical injections and that increasing tumor burden correlates negatively with neurologic outcome, body weight and survival. In the N87 studies, animals received treatments beginning on Day 2 post-implantation and continuing for up to 6 weeks. Dose groups (n=12/group) were vehicle, ARRY-380 at MTD (75 mg/kg, PO, BID) or lapatinib at MTD (50 mg/kg, PO, BID). All animals in the vehicle- or lapatinib-treated groups did not survive beyond Day 22. In the ARRY-380-treated-group, 75% of the animals were alive on Day 43. Brain PK/PD was also evaluated in the N87 model. ARRY-380 and its active metabolite caused a significant reduction in brain pErbB2 (80%). In the BT-474 model, animals received treatments beginning on Day 2 post-implantation and continuing for up to 8 weeks. Dose groups (n=13/group) were vehicle, ARRY-380 at MTD (75 mg/kg, PO, BID), lapatinib at MTD (50 mg/kg, PO, BID) or neratinib at MTD (40 mg/kg, PO, QD). On Day 56, survival in the ARRY-380 group was 69% while survival rates in the vehicle, lapatinib or neratinib-treated groups were 23%, 8% and 23%, respectively. Thus ARRY-380 treatment significantly enhances survival in two ErbB2 driven intracranial tumor xenograft models, with superior activity compared to other ErbB2 agents in these studies. Additionally, ARRY-380 has demonstrated durable clinical activity in heavily pre-treated patients with ErbB2+ MBC.

        "Background":"['In spite of clinical advancements, tumors that no longer depend on ER/PR and ERBB2 signaling are clinically aggressive and have the poorest prognosis. Few effective treatment options exist for basal or trastuzumab-resistant ERBB2 breast cancers. Understanding the signaling pathways that drive these aggressive breast cancer subtypes is critical to the development of successful therapeutics. The receptor tyrosine kinase MET is overexpressed in 20-30% of breast cancers and correlates with poor patient outcome, independent of ERBB2 expression. Previously, we determined that MET is expressed in the majority of breast cancers. Most importantly, we determined that high MET expression correlated with ERneg/ERBB2neg tumors and the basal subtype. These studies indicate that MET may serve as a novel therapeutic target for those patients with the most aggressive tumors and currently, the fewest therapeutic options. We are utilizing breast cancer cell lines and xenograft mouse models to examine how MET and ERBB2 uniquely influence breast cancer progression. To investigate the effects of MET and/or ERBB2 inhibition we are utilizing lentiviral shRNA knockdown in both basal and luminal cells. We observed that both MET and ERBB2 depletion decrease cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, we have profiled the effects of MET and ERBB2 knockdown on the phosphorylation of 42 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and 44 tyrosine kinases. We observed that downstream signaling at the tyrosine kinase level is minimally affected by downregulation of MET or ERBB2; however, there is significant signaling compensation that occurs at the RTK level through the ERBB family members, EGFR and ERBB3. Currently, we are examining the interaction between MET and the ERBB family in both basal and luminal breast cancer cell lines. In addition, we are measuring the effect of MET or ERBB2 depletion on growth of breast cancer cells in 3D culture. In addition, we have evaluated MET and ERBB2 expression in human invasive breast carcinomas using coimmunostaining and quantitative analysis with the CRi Nuance multispectral imager. We observe that a significant percentage of tumors coexpress MET and ERBB2. Many tumors have significant heterogeneity of MET and ERBB2 expression and have patterns of cells that are METhigh/ERBB2low, METlow/ERBB2high, and METhigh/ERBB2high. We hypothesize that breast cancer cells expressing both MET and ERBB2 (METhigh/ERBB2high) are highly tumorigenic and have an increased proliferative capacity, metastatic potential and chemoresistance. Currently, fresh primary human breast cancer tissue is being transplanted into mammary glands of NOD-SCIDIL2R mice to determine the impact of MET and ERBB2 expression on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. These studies will reveal whether MET and ERBB2 have synergistic or exclusive roles in breast cancer progression and how these oncogenes can be targeted for successful therapy.']",

        "Background":"['The ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases is composed of four members', 'EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4; these are membrane bound proteins that control important cell functions through the activation of signaling cascades such as the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the phosphatidylinoditol3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathways. Deregulated expression of the ErbB family by gene amplification and/or protein over-expression is associated with the development and progression of a variety of cancer types.Notably, ErbB2 over expression is observed in approximately 25% of human breast tumors. The negative regulator, LRIG1 is a transmembrane protein that can directly interact with all members of the ErbB family leading to receptor degradation. In addition, in vitro experiments have shown that loss of LRIG1 is sufficient to drive an increase in ErbB2 protein levels and signaling while ectopic expression of LRIG1 decreases ErbB protein expression and signaling.Recently, a group of ErbB2 C-terminal fragments (CTFs) collectively known as p95HER2have captured the attention of the scientific community becausea) they are capable of inducing more aggressive tumors compared with those expressing full length ErbB2 and because b) they have been directly implicated in therapeutic resistance to Herceptin, the standard of care for ErbB2-positive breast cancer. ErbB2 CTFsare generated by two independent mechanisms; 1) initiation of translation at alternative methionine codons, producing two fragments known as 611-CTF and 687-CTF; 2) Proteolytic shedding of full length ErbB2, generating 648-CTF and 676-CTF fragments. Clinical data indicate that p95HER2 positive patients have lower survival rates compared with those expressing low p95HER2 levels.Among the p95HER fragments, 611-CTF is the most interesting because it is hyperactive and has been associated with increased cell migration, tumor progression and metastasis. Currently, nothing is known of the mechanisms which govern p95HER2 down-regulation. Insight into these mechanisms could ultimately lead to the development of new therapeutics which may improve the response rate of p95HER2-positive breast cancer. In this study we examined whether 611-CTF is susceptible to LRIG1-mediated down-regulation. We find that these proteins interact and that ectopic expression of LRIG1 is sufficient to decrease 611-CTF protein expression in three different cell lines. Furthermore, LRIG1 is capable of reducing 611-driven tumor cell proliferation and migration. Our results are surprising because LRIG1 is thought to recognize its targets through mutual ecto-domain interactions and 611-CTF lacks a large portion of the ErbB2 ecto-domain.Citation Format', ' Maria E.

This indicates that ErbB2 suppresses Notch1 in breast cancer and therapeutic intervention targeting ErbB2 might have an unintended consequence which is aberrant up regulation of Notch1 which is a breast oncogene.However, the mechanism of action by which ErbB2 restricts Notch1 activation is unknown. In this current study, we investigated the role of cis- and trans-activation of Notch signaling by Notch ligands which are developmentally conversed to tightly regulate Notch activation. To address this hypothesis, we performed co-culture studies using fibroblasts expressing no Notch ligands or over-expressing human Jagged1 or Deltalike1 and ErbB2 positive breast cancer cells. We performed flow cytometry to isolate breast cancer cells after co-culture and extracted RNA to measure expression of Notch gene targets as a measure of Notch activity. The results showed that trastuzumab, Lapatinib, or ErbB2 knockdown increased overall Notch activition. Similarly, Co-culture with Jagged1-expressing fibroblasts increased overall Notch activation. However, Knocked down of Jagged1 in the breast cancer cells had little effect on ligand-induced Notch activation relieving the possibility of cis-inhibition. In contrast, Jagged1 knocked down abrogated trastuzumab-induced Notch activation in the breast cancer cells. These results suggest that ErbB2 might restrict Notch activation by preventing Jagged1-mediated trans activation of Notch and not by promoting cis-inhibition. Confocal immunofluorescence showed that Jagged1 is localized with Notch1 when ErbB2 is hyperactive but is trafficked to the cell surface in response to trastuzumab. K44ADynamin abrogated Jagged1 expression on the cell surface as measured by IF and surface biotinylation studies. Furthermore, K44ADynamin expression abrogated trastuzumab-induced Notch1 activation. Importantly, we measured growth consequences of Jagged1-mediated Notch activation in response to trastuzumab and found that Jagged1 is necessary for survival of ErbB2 positive breast cancer cells and trastuzumab resistance as measured by cell cycle analysis and Annexin V staining.

As these alterations are not routinely tested for but may predict response to anti-ERBB2 agents we sought to determine their frequency in an unselected cohort of specimens from advanced ST patients.    Methods', '  We reviewed genomic profiles from the first 2,223 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens received and analyzed by our CLIA-certified lab (Foundation Medicine) with our NGS platform. 3,230 exons in 182 cancer-related genes and 14 genes frequently rearranged were assayed for base pair substitutions, small insertions/deletions (indels), amplifications, and rearrangements.   Results', '  110/2,223 (4.9%) specimens had 116 ERBB2 alterations', ' 67 (58%) amplifications, 29 (25%) substitutions, 16 (14%) indels, 2 (2%) splice site variants and 2 (2%) translocations, including a potential fusion. Six samples (5%) had multiple alterations, and two had both ERBB2 substitution and amplification.  14 ST types had evidence of ERBB2 alterations including 29% of esophageal, 20% of uterine, 14% of breast, and 12% of stomach carcinomas. 6% of all lung cancer samples had ERBB2 alterations. Amplifications predominated, but lung specimens had predominantly indels. Durable responses exist to anti-ERBB2 agents in STs with activating ERBB2 mutations.  Conclusions', '  Use of a broad NGS panel identifies an unprecedented number of actionable genomic changes including a significant rate of ERBB2 alterations across 14 different solid tumor types. The discovery of unanticipated ERBB2 amplifications and activating mutations in a wide variety of ST highlights the need to study a broad range of genes at a high level of sensitivity and specificity when searching for novel targets of therapy.

In addition, the ErbB2/3 heterodimer forms the most potent mitogenic receptor in vitro and is key to the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Despite the importance of this heterodimer in breast cancer progression, the negative regulation of these ErbB tyrosine kinases is still poorly understood. We demonstrate here for the first time that the ErbB3/4 ligand Heregulin (HRG) reduces mRNA and protein levels of both ErbB2 and ErbB3 in human breast cancer cell lines. We have found that after 24h of HRG treatment, ErbB2 expression decreased at both the RNA and protein levels in ErbB2 overexpressing AU565, BT474 and LTLT-Ca breast cancer cell lines. In contrast, EGFR levels were unaffected by HRG treatment. An initial decline in steady state mRNA levels was first noted at 1 hour after HRG treatment. ErbB3 levels also decreased in LTLT-Ca cells after HRG treatment. Lapatinib, which inhibits ErbB2 and EGFR kinase activity and HRG induced-ErbB3 phosphorylation, diminished the HRG- induced decrease in ErbB2 and ErbB3 in AU565 and LTLT-Ca cells. This finding suggests that the kinase activity of EGFR/ErbB2 may be involved in the HRG-induced down-regulation. HRG did not change the activity of ErbB2 promoter reporter constructs spanning 215 kb to 6007 kb upstream of the ErbB2 transcription start site as indicated by luciferase assays. An ongoing study suggests that HRG could be involved in decreasing ErbB2 mRNA stability. Our findings suggest that resistance to Lapatinib may be due in part to the fact that inhibition of ErbB2/ EGFR kinase activity dampens the negative effect of HRG on ErbB2 expression, resulting in elevated levels of ErbB2 in breast cancer cells.']",

Notably, ErbB2 over-expression is observed in approximately 25% of human breast tumors.Trastuzumab, an FDA approved therapeutic currently used to treat ErbB2 positive breast cancer patients, is a monoclonal antibody that directly binds the ErbB2 extracellular domain. Unfortunately, only a fraction of patients treated with trastuzumab durably respond to the treatment. Moreover, patients that are treated long term with this antibody develop resistance. One of the proposed mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance is the expression of 611-CTF, a C-terminal fragment of ErbB2 which lacks most of its extracellular domain. Remarkably, 611-CTF is hyperactive and has been associated with increased cell migration, tumor progression and metastasis.Currently nothing is known regarding mechanisms which lead to 611-CTF down-regulation. This represents a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of 611-CTF and receptor fragments in general. Since 611-CTF is associated with poor clinical outcome and therapeutic resistance, it is essential to clarify the mechanisms by which this ErbB2 fragment is regulated. This knowledge could ultimately lead to the development of new therapeutics which could improve the response rate of 611-CTF-positive breast cancer.LRIG1 is a tumor suppressor that directly interacts with ErbB2 leading to receptor degradation. In this study we examined whether 611-CTF is susceptible to LRIG1-mediated down-regulation. We find that these proteins interact and that expression of LRIG1 is sufficient to decrease 611-CTF protein expression in three different cell lines. Furthermore, LRIG1 is capable of reducing 611-CTF-driven tumor cell proliferation and migration. Our results are unexpected because LRIG1 is thought to recognize its targets through mutual extracellular domain interactions and 611-CTF lacks a large portion of the ErbB2 extracellular domain.']",

Glutaminolysis represents the first and rate-limiting step of glutamine utilization and is catalyzed by glutaminase. Previous studies have shown that c-Myc regulates glutaminolysis by increasing glutaminase expression in tumor cells. However, it remains unclear whether other oncogenic signaling pathways promote glutaminolysis. Breast cancer is the second most common cause of death for women in the United States and ErbB2 activation is one of the major causes of breast cancer. Using MCF10A and MCF10A-derived NeuT cells, we studied the effect of ErbB2 activation on glutaminase expression, and found that ErbB2 activation increased glutaminase 1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Knockdown of ErbB2 decreased glutaminase 1 expression in several human ErbB2-positive cell lines. Consistently, blocking ErbB2 signaling pathway by trastuzumab repressed glutaminase 1 expression. We further showed that in these cells, ErbB2-mediated up-regulation of glutaminase 1 was independent of c-Myc expression. In addition, we found that activation of PI3K/Akt or MAPK pathway was not sufficient to up-regulate glutaminase 1 expression. Instead, inhibition of NF-B down-regulated glutaminase 1 expression whereas stimulation of NF-B induced glutaminase 1 expression, suggesting a PI3K/Akt-independent activation of NF-B signaling pathway up-regulates glutaminase 1. Finally, inhibition of glutaminase activity significantly decreased human breast cancer cell proliferation. Our data indicate that ErbB2 activation promotes glutaminase 1 expression via NF-B in breast cancer cells, identifying another oncogenic signaling pathway which stimulates glutamine utilization.

        "Background":"['ERBB2 kinase domain mutations were recently reported in some solid cancers. Moreover, certain ERBB2 mutations were shown to cause lapatinib resistance in vitro thus predicting their emergence in treated patients. We have recently shown that ERBB2-L755S, ERBB2-L755P and ERBB2-T798M mutants cause lapatinib resistance by stabilizing the active kinase conformation (DFG-in), which is incompatible with lapatinib binding (DFG-out). Using an in vitro cell-based drug resistance screen we also showed that these lapatinib resistant mutations might cause secondary resistance in patients treated with lapatinb. Thus, it is important to search for alternate treatment strategies to overcome lapatinib resistance. ERBB2 kinase is a client for HSP90 and is degraded by HSP90 inhibitor treatment. We thus tested if targeting ERBB2 mutant stability by inhibiting HSP90 overcomes lapatinib resistance. Since the kinase domain is important for the ERBB2 interaction with HSP90, we tested whether ERBB2 kinase domain mutants retained their interaction with the chaperone. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the interaction of ERBB2 mutants with HSP90 is intact. Importantly, HSP90 inhibitor treatment resulted in the degradation of lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutants as observed with the wild type ERBB2 kinase. Thus, HSP90 inhibitors may offer an alternative treatment option to overcome primary or secondary lapatinib resistance in patients harbouring ERBB2 mutations. Moreover, combined targeting of different physiological aspects (enzyme activity and protein stability) may prevent the emergence of secondary drug resistance due to kinase domain mutations.']",

The penetrance of the multiacinar phenotype is incomplete and random, and dimerization with other ErbB family members gives rise to quantitative differences in penetrance. Our goal is to understand the mechanism by which a multiacinus initiates and why only a random fraction of the cultured acini exhibit the morphogenetic defect when ErbB2 is activated. Our working hypothesis is that acute differences (dichotomies) in gene expression develop among acini and give rise to the distinct 3D phenotypes induced by ErbB2. The transcriptional dichotomies that exist before the appearance of the multiacinar phenoptype will be the ones most likely to control it. We are using a new technique, called stochastic profiling, that our lab developed for discovering transcriptional dichotomies in a seemingly uniform cell population. We have established single ErbB2 dimer clones with similar expression levels of ErbB2 and its dimerization partner. Expression of the ErbB2 constructs was also validated at the single-cell level in frozen acinar sections by RNA FISH. Laser capture microdissection was used to select a small number of cells (10-100 cells) from the fresh frozen 3D sections followed by RNA extraction and small-sample cDNA amplification. The amplification parameters were optimized for the ErbB2 clones in different culture formats. We observed good quantitative linearity and amplification efficiencies for a wide range of high- and low-abundance targets in a 2D-culture format. We are working to improve the amplification efficiency of samples microdissected in the 3D-culture format.

FFPE specimens from an additional 18 cases from our own institution have been evaluated using the combination of the RainDance ThunderBolts Cancer Panel for validation.Results. Of 116 TCGA breast cancers with CDH1 alterations, 86 were invasive lobular breast cancer. Within this subset, 21 pleomorphic lobular breast cancers were identified based on morphologic review.

        "Background":"['Repeated DNA segments (Low Copy Repeats, Segmental Duplications) are highly homologous sequences within the human genome. They are typically 10-300 kb in length, and bear >95% sequence identity. In germline, repeated DNA segments mediate recurrent DNA rearrangements and thus cause specific genetic disorders called genomic disorders. Repeated genomic segments could also be prone to rearrangements in somatic cells and thus could mediate recurrent rearrangements in cancer. However, the important role of repeated genomic segments in genome instability in cancer remains elusive, mainly because such regions are less accessible by current genomic technologies due to the difficulty in assembling and interrogating sequences. Gene amplification is a cellular process characterized by the production of multiple copies of a particular gene through DNA rearrangements. ERBB2, an epidermal growth factor receptor gene, is amplified in 15-20% of breast tumors. Due to excessive cell growth signaling, this recurrent amplification is associated with advanced stages and poor prognosis. Despite the clinical importance, the mechanisms giving rises to recurrent ERBB2 amplification remains unclear. We hypothesized that, similar to the recurrent rearrangements for genomic disorders, repeated genomic segments cause DNA rearrangements for ERBB2 amplification. To test the hypothesis and understand the mechanism of ERBB2 amplification, we mapped a common copy-number breakpoint for primary ERBB2-amplified (HER2-positive) breast tumors. Copy number breakpoints were examined at every 300-kilo bases (kb) from the location of ERBB2 to its telomeric region using real-time PCR based assays. The breakpoint that marked a region between normal copy number and low level amplification resided within a 300-kb complex genomic region at the 1.5 mega-bases telomeric side of ERBB2. The region contains many repeated segments from two gene families. Furthermore, the HapMap SNPs, a set of SNPs that tag haploblocks in the human genome, are less well-defined, indicating the difficulty in interrogating the genomic region by current genomic technologies. Normal copy-number variations seem common, as there is several deletion polymorphisms reported in the region. Two sub-regions, each covering 40-kb region, are particularly complex due to a number of direct and inverted repeats. The prevalence of this copy number breakpoint in HER2-positive breast tumors was also shown in a study by Sircoulomb et al.,(BMC Cancer 2010), in which common amplifications and deletions were determined for 54 HER-2 positive breast tumors. Defining (1) the copy-number breakpoint with very high resolution and (2) critical DNA sequences for ERBB2 amplification will lead to better understanding the amplification mechanism underlying this aggressive type of breast cancer.']",

In order to determine why these cell lines were resistant to Cmab we performed genome wide copy number analyses and analysis of ERBB family ligands. We analyzed the growth of Cmab sensitive and resistant cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we obtained clinical specimens from colon cancer pts treated with Cmab based therapy. Specimens obtained prior to therapy and at the time of Cmab resistance were evaluated. <Result> Genome-wide copy number analysis detected the localized genomic amplification in HCC 827CR, which was identified as ERBB2 and confirmed using FISH. Amplification of ERBB2 was also detected in the GEO CR cells. ERBB2 inhibition, with either trastuzumab or lapatinib, restored the Cmab sensitivity in those cell lines. In drug sensitive cell lines, Cmab effectively inhibited growth and ERK1/2 signaling both of which were inhibited in presence of ERBB2 amplification. In contrast, despite detecting ERBB2 activation in the A431 CR cells we did not identify ERBB2 amplification. Instead we detected increased levels of the ERBB3 ligand heregulin. The disruption of ERBB2/ERBB3 herterodimerization using pertuzumab restored Cmab sensitivity in A431CR in vitro and in vivo. CRC patients with ERBB2 amplification (n=13) treated with Cmab based therapy survived significantly shorter than pts without ERBB2 amplification (n=220) (The median OS 89 vs 149 days, p=0.0013; log-rank test). We also identified evidence of ERBB2 amplification at the time of acquired drug resistance using either tumor biopsies or by analyzing serum HER2 extracellular domain (ECD). We further analyzed plasma heregulin from CRC patients and the concentrations ranged widely (Median, 1622 pg/ml; range 0-18,045 pg/ml). Pts who achieved response to Cmab therapy (n=16) had significantly lower heregulin concentration than pts without response (n=49) (Mean, 1,050 vs 3,601 pg/ml, p<0.001; unpaired t test). In addition we identified a significant increase in plasma heregulin levels obtained at the time of clinic cetuximab resistance compared to pre-treatment specimens (p=0.0313). <Conclusion> We identify activation of ERBB2 signaling, either through ERBB2 amplification or through heregulin upregulation, as a mechanism of both de novo and acquired cetuximab resistance.

        "Background":"['ErbB2 expression is observed in 25 - 30 % of invasive breast cancers and is associated with reduced response to chemotherapy, and shorter time to relapse and reduced overall survival of breast cancer patients. Malignant mammary epithelial cells that overexpress ErbB2 exhibit enhanced proliferation, invasion of mammary tissue and metastasis. The stability of overexpressed mature ErbB2 at the plasma membrane of mammary epithelial cells is critically dependent on its interaction with the chaperone protein, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Thus, Hsp90 promotes the proliferation and survival of malignant mammary epithelial cells and interruption of this interaction is expected to inhibit the growth of ErbB2-overexpressing tumors. 17-AminoAllyl-Geldanamycin (17-AAG), an Hsp90 inhibitor, is a semi-synthetic ansamycin antibiotic currently in phase II clinical trials for breast cancer treatment (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Because it preferentially binds to Hsp90 of the chaperone complex in malignant mammary epithelial cells, treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer with 17-AAG is expected to destabilize ErbB2 and inhibit tumor growth. While a number of Hsp90 client proteins have been identified, ErbB2 is amongst the most sensitive to Hsp90 inhibition. These facts provide strong rationale for using 17-AAG as a part of the targeted therapy against ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer. However the cellular machinery responsible for 17-AAG induced degradation of ErbB2 is not completely understood. At present it is unclear whether internalization of ErbB2 occurs via Clathrin-dependent or -independent endocytosis. Furthermore it is unresolved if the degradation of ErbB2 is dependent upon proteasomal or lysosomal proteolysis. And although C-terminus of Hsp70 Interacting Protein (CHIP) and Cullin 5 were identified as E3 ligases responsible for the ubiquitination of ErbB2, it is unknown if these ligases are the sole E3s responsible for the ubiquitnation of ErbB2. Also vague is if the rerouting of ErbB2 from the recycling pathway to the degradative pathway in response to 17-AAG is exclusively dependent upon ubiquitnation. In this current work we attempt to bridge these critical gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of 17-AAG induced degradation of ErbB2 using an automated microscopy-based analysis to identify genes whose siRNA-dependent suppression reduces 17AAG-induced ErbB2 degradation.

Methods', ' Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed on 83 BC samples with 48 metastatic; 34 primary samples. Targeted next-generation sequencing was performed on 562 cancer associated genes in paired tumor and blood DNA (germline) samples. Results', ' ESR1-mut were found in 23%(11/48) of ER+ MBC tissues with no mut detected in primary ER+ BCs. Mutations-D538G, Y537S and E380Q in the ligand binding domain of ER were the most common alterations, found in 54.5%, 18% and 18% of ESR1 mut samples, respectively. An ER+ HER2- liver biopsy obtained after 20 mos on AI + everolimus had ESR1-D538G and TSC2 structural event. Protein array showed high expression of androgen receptor (AR) and p-AR and activation of ERBB1/2/3, p-SRC and p-4EBP1 in this sample. Further, a functionally uncharacterized ESR1 mut was found in ER+, HER2+ and a triple negative MBC tissue (the primary BC had been ER+). Mut in PI3K pathway (PIK3CA, ARID1A, TSC1/2, PTEN) were present in 8/11 samples with ESR1 mut. Activating mut in ERBB2 were found in 3/83 samples; all 3 were in ER+ MBC samples with one case harboring mut in both ERBB2 and ESR1 (E380Q  uncertain degree of constitutive activity). Interestingly, a BC sample with ER+ HER2- liver met harbored both ERBB2 (V777L) and ERBB3 (E928G) mut; this pt responded well to trastuzumab/pertuzumab (HP) therapy. A pt with ER+ HER2-ERBB2- L755S mut met to gallbladder found after 7 mos on letrozole/palbociclib therapy responded well to HP and T-DM1 therapy.

Conclusions', ' This study shows a 23% and 6% ESR1 and ERBB2 mut rate in MBC samples. No ESR1 and ERBB2 mut were present in primary BC samples.

        "Background":"['Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and highly invasive type of breast cancer, and patients diagnosed with IBC often face a very poor prognosis. IBC is characterized by the lack of primary tumor formation and the rapid accumulation of cancerous epithelial cells in the dermal lymphatic vessels. Given that normal epithelial cells require attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) for survival, a comprehensive examination of the molecular mechanisms underlying IBC cell survival in the lymphatic vessels is of paramount importance to our understanding of IBC pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate that in contrast to normal mammary epithelial cells, IBC cells evade ECM-detachment-induced apoptosis (anoikis) and maintain ATP levels following ECM detachment. Exogenous ErbB2 overexpression leads to increased ATP production and soft agar growth in IBC cells that normally lack ErbB2 amplification. Additionally, ErbB2 knockdown in KPL-4 cells, an IBC cell line characterized by high levels of ErbB2, resulted in diminished ATP levels, decreased colony growth, and increased caspase activation following ECM detachment. Further studies reveal that the protection from anoikis in IBC cells is dependent on activation of the ERK-MAPK pathway, but does not depend on modulation of the levels of the pro-apoptotic factor Bim. These results demonstrate that ErbB2 is necessary and sufficient for IBC cell survival in the absence of ECM attachment. Understanding the molecular mechanism utilized by IBC cells to survive in matrix-detached conditions could lead to more specific and effective therapeutics to prevent IBC metastasis from occurring and to treat patients in which metastasis has already occurred.']",

        "Background":"['Purpose', ' Hormone therapy and anti-ErbB2 (HER-2) therapy are prescribed according to the hormone status (ER/PR protein expression) and ErbB2 expression of the initial tumor. Several trials have shown the prognostic relevance of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in early and metastatic breast cancers. As it appears that the CTC, and consequently the metastatic cells, may have a very different receptor status than the related primary tumors, it is of the highest relevance to analyze ER and ErbB2 expression of the CTC. Experimental procedures', ' We developed a triple fluorescence technique to visualize simultaneously cytokeratin (8/18, 8/19), ER and ErbB2 on each individual cell. Using this protocol, we analyzed ER and ErbB2 expression in various breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, Cama-1, ZR75, SK-Br-3, HCC 3153, MDA-MB-231), and compared ER expression in the different cell lines using also immunostaining. We were then able to test the CTC presence (CK positivity) and ER and ErbB2 expressions on blood samples (cytospins) collected from 15 metastatic breast cancer patients. Results', ' The 2-step triple fluorescence protocol was optimized to visualize CK in green (DyLight488 conjugate), ER in red (cy3 conjugate) and ErbB2 in blue (AMCA conjugate). Using in parallel this triple fluorescence protocol and the reference immunostaining technique, we could analyze that ER-positive cell lines express very different levels of ER and within one cell line, cells can express low, moderate and/or high levels of ER. The identification of cells that express a very low level of ER is compulsory as the CTC from one unique patient can potentially express differently ER. Consequently, ER-positivity and -negativity have to be clearly defined. CTC analysis from patient blood samples was then performed with an individual assessment, for each single isolated cell, of cytokeratin (epithelial marker that peripheral blood cells should not express) and of ER and ErbB2 expressions. We were able to identify, among the CTC positive patients, changes between primary tumor status and CTC status, e.g. ER-positive primary tumors with both ER-positive and ER-negative CTC. Those ER-negative CTC may direct towards tamoxifen resistance and have to be identified among other ER-positive cells, similarly as any ErbB2 negative CTC. Conclusion', ' We demonstrated that triple immunofluorescence is very relevant, first to identify CTC, and then to allow an individual assessment of ER and ErbB2 expression, at the protein level. Moreover, the approach we developed allows to characterize a population of CTC with a very low expression of ER. Large multicentric cohorts of breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant therapy should now be analyzed for both ER and ErbB2 status of the CTC, compared to the primary tumor profile. The expected results should lead to optimal individualized treatments.']",

        "Background":"['Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2), often accompanied by ERBB2 gene amplification, is present in 25% of early-stage breast cancers. In a relatively small subset of breast cancer patients (4,000 cases each year in the US) ERBB2 is alternatively activated by gain-of-function mutations without gene amplification and receptor overexpression. These somatic mutations frequently occur in the kinase domain of ERBB2 and induce receptor phosphorylation, PI3K/AKT pathway hyperactivation, and malignant transformation. Breast cancer patients bearing ERBB2-mutated tumors are candidates for treatment with the irreversible kinase inhibitor neratinib. Although this therapeutic strategy is showing remarkable activity in a significant proportion of patients, emergence of acquired resistance inevitably occurs. The aim of this study is to identify the possible mechanisms of acquired resistance to neratinib therapy in ERBB2-mutated breast cancers. As part of the ongoing phase II SUMMIT basket study of neratinib in ERBB2-mutant cancers (NCT01953926), we have identified a common genomic alteration in tumors from three patients that progressed following initial benefit from neratinib treatment. Targeted exome sequencing of biopsies collected at time of disease progression revealed increased copy number of the ERBB2-mutant allele. In one case, the resistant lesions were confirmed to be avid for zirconium-89-trastuzumab and the patient responded to subsequent antibody-based anti-ERBB2 therapy. In an attempt to confirm that increased expression of the mutant allele was sufficient to limit neratinib sensitivity, we measured the antitumor activity of this agent in MCF10A cells stably expressing several activating mutations of ERBB2 compared to cells expressing equal levels of the wild type receptor. We found that higher concentrations of neratinib were needed to inhibit the proliferation of ERBB2-mutant cells compared to wild-type. Further, enhanced receptor activity in the ERBB2-mutant cells correlated with increased formation of ERBB2/ERBB3 dimers, activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and in vivo tumorigenic potential. Combined ERBB2 and ERBB3 inhibition efficiently inhibited phosphorylation of ERBB2/ERBB3 and cell proliferation. We plan to overexpress the ERBB2-mutant allele in cell lines/organoids obtained from ERBB2-mutant patient-derived xenografts, phenocopying our results from the clinical specimens. We hypothesize that this manipulation will be sufficient to induce increase ERBB2/ERBB3 dimerization and resistance to neratinib. In summary, we believe that amplification of mutated ERBB2ERBB2 promotes increased ERBB2/ERBB3 dimerization, ERBB3 activation, and subsequent downstream signaling activation. Dual ERBB2/ERBB3 blockade may be a potential strategy to delay or prevent resistance to neratinib in ERBB2-mutant breast tumors.']",

        "Background":"['Several studies suggest that Pak1 plays an important role in the genesis of breast cancer, but despite the similarity in their sequences, the contribution of the closely related enzyme Pak2 to this disease remains unclear. To establish the function of Paks in ErbB2 driven transformation, we used a three-dimensional tissue culture system of human mammary epithelial cells that stably co-express a chemically-activatable form of ErbB2 and doxycycline (DOX) inducible shRNAs against Pak1 or Pak2. We observed that silencing of Pak1 but not of Pak2 has a dramatic effect in cell proliferation and apoptosis. As expected, activation of ErbB2 induced growth factor-independent proliferation and disruption of 3D acinar-like structures via ERK and Akt signaling. In contrast, silencing of Pak1 compromised activation of ERK, resulting in reversion of the malignant phenotype and restoration of normal acinar architecture. Surprisingly, silencing of Pak2 also compromised ERK activation, but cannot restore normal morphology. Further, we found that ErbB2-amplified breast cancer cells expressing a DOX inducible shRNA against Pak1 formed significantly smaller tumors than cells expressing either GFP or a DOX inducible shRNA against Pak2 in SCID mice as the result of the inhibition of ERK. A phosphoproteomic analysis showed that several signaling pathways, e.g. Wnt and Mdm2-p53, are down regulated in our Pak1 deficient cell line. We found that the shPak1 cell line, but not the shPak2 deficient cell line has a dramatic reduction in total -catenin levels, and that blocking -catenin with chemical inhibitors restored normal acinar architecture. Finally, we found that targeting Pak and/or -catenin in combination with trastuzumab sensitized trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells to trastuzumab, suggesting the potential clinical application of this strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance.']",

In contrast, active immunotherapy through therapeutic vaccination has yet to be proven clinically effective for breast cancer. One potential means of improving vaccine therapy is by delivering breast cancer antigens to dendritic cells (DCs) for enhanced antigen presentation. To achieve this in vivo, we have pseudotyped lentiviral vector vaccines with a modified Sindbis Virus glycoprotein that targets the C-type lectin DC-SIGN, which is expressed on DCs. We hypothesized that utilizing these DC-targeting lentiviral vectors as a breast cancer vaccine could lead to an improved immune response against self antigens found in breast cancer tumors. Such an improved immune response may help to prevent or slow tumor growth in breast cancer models. To test these hypotheses, we have constructed lentiviral vectors encoding each of the breast cancer antigens, human Her2 (ERBB2) and mouse alpha-lactalbumin (Lalba). Single injections were able to amplify antigen-specific CD8 T cells to 1.6% of total CD8 T cells in BALB/cJ mice and 0.7% in transgenic ERBB2 mice. This compares favorably with recently published vector vaccines, which have elicited 0.9% and <0.1% antigen-specific CD8 T cells under similar conditions. In addition, DC-targeted immunization of these mice completely inhibited tumor growth in a foreign antigen environment (ERBB2 + wt BALB/cJ), while it significantly reduced the rate of tumor growth in a self-antigen environment (Lalba + BALB/cJ or ERBB2 + FVB/Tg.MMTV.f.huHER2 #5). Our data show that these vectors alone can provide an effective therapy. Future studies may be able to improve these responses by combining DC-targeted immunization with established methods of reducing cancer immunosuppression.

Integrated data sets may lead to more efficient and specific approaches for the elucidation of therapeutic targets and biomarkers and for the identification of specific small molecule inhibitors. However, the power of these computational methods to study human cancer from an unbiased global perspective is severely compromised by the low through-put approaches necessary to functionally validate the in silico predictions. During the last years, RNA interference (RNAi) emerged as a very powerful genetic strategy to functionally interrogate the entire genome by loss-of-function studies. This cellular process can be experimentally controlled to knock down the expression of any specific gene. Our group has pioneered the development of RNAi-based genetic tools to translate RNAi studies to mammalian systems generating a shRNA-mir pooled lentiviral library that allows performing functional studies at genome-wide level. ErbB2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase found overexpressed in 20-40% of breast tumors correlating with a malignant phenotype and worse prognosis. Different targeted therapies have been developed to specifically inhibit its activity such the monoclonal antibody Herceptin, or the small tyrosine kinase inhibitor Lapatinib.

        "Background":"['In a recent report (Paroni et al, Oncogene, 31', '3431-43, 2012), we demonstrated that 25% of all ERBB2+ breast cancers present with a co-amplification of the RARA locus, encoding the nuclear retinoic acid receptor, RAR. ERBB2+/RARA+ breast cancer cell lines, like SKBR3 and AU565, are sensitive to the anti-proliferative and cyto-differentiating effects of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), whereas the ERBB2+/RARA counterparts are refractory. Simultaneous targeting of RAR with ATRA and ERBB2 with lapatinib in SKBR3 and AU565 cells leads to synergistic interactions as to growth inhibition and cyto-differentiation. In addition, combinations of ATRA and lapatinib exert an apoptotic effect, which is not observed with the single components. This suggests that ERBB2+/RARA+ breast cancer patients may benefit from lapatinib+ATRA regimens and represent the rationale of an ongoing clinical trial.The use of lapatinib and ATRA for the stratified therapy of ERBB2+/RARA+ patients requires knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the cross-talk between the two compounds. We evaluated the effects of lapatinib and/or ATRA on the expression profiles of more than 1,000 microRNAs in SKBR3 cells using an appropriate microarray platform. Both lapatinib and ATRA caused up- and down-regulation of numerous microRNAs. The combination of the two compounds enhanced the action of the single components of the mixture and resulted in the up- and down-regulation of novel target microRNAs as well. We integrated these results with microRNA-target-gene prediction algorithms and whole-genome gene-expression data looking for significant correlations between microRNA and potential/established target mRNA levels. Network analysis led to the identification of two highly interconnected microRNA/target-mRNA modules controlled in opposite directions by lapatinib+ATRA.

Mutations are tracked in circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) to examine the clonal selection of tumor cells evoked by therapy. Here we report the results from a patient with metastasizing HER2 negative and estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer (Luminal A) previously exposed to seven lines of chemotherapy as well as ER antagonists and aromatase inhibitors. After enrollment in the program, examination of liver metastases by whole exome sequencing, RNA-Seq and microarray expression analysis revealed high expression of the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) as well as a mutation in the ligand-binding domain of ESR1 (H524L). Moreover, somatic variants in ERBB2 and PIK3CA were identified, including an activating mutation in ERBB2 (S310Y), and consequently the patient treated with neratinib, an irreversible pan-HER (EGFR/ERBB2/ERBB4) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, through a compassionate use program (Puma Biotechnology Inc.). Neratinib caused a rapid decrease in the allelic frequency of ERBB2 (S310Y) cfDNA after 2 days with a continuous decline during the next 7 days. Consistent with this neratinib treatment effect, MRI scans showed regression of the liver metastases. In contrast, the PIK3CA mutation showed an increase in the allele frequency, indicating the existence of a subclone that was insensitive to neratinib. Two months later, the total amount of cfDNA increased and continued to do so. After 5 months on neratinib, the patient progressed with the appearance of brain metastases which were surgically removed and subject to WES. The vast majority of the mutations, including the ERBB2 mutation, observed in the liver metastasis could not be identified in the brain metastases, except for the PIK3CA mutation. More than 300 new variants were exclusively identified in the brain metastases, among these, ERBB3 as well as new PIK3CA, and ESR1 mutations, that were not present in the pre-treatment cfDNA samples. After 4 months of treatment, an increase in the mutation frequency of the liver metastasis specific ESR1 and ERBB2 mutations was observed. In conclusion, neratinib was able to suppress an activating ERBB2 mutation in a heavily pre-treated ER+ breast cancer patient. However, refractory tumor clones harboring ERBB3, PIK3CA and ESR1 mutations developed in brain. These data indicate that combining neratinib with fulvestrant or inhibitors of the HER3/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway might prove beneficial to overcome potential resistance mechanisms to therapy.The two first authors contributed equally.']",

The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of eltrombopag and expression of MPL mRNA on a variety of tumor types. Methods', ' Proliferation was measured by Cell Titer Glo assay on 3 breast, 4 lung, 3 ovarian, and 2 prostate cancer cell lines from the ATCC treated with 0.1-100 g/mL eltrombopag for up to 72 hours.

Results', ' Eltrombopag, at clinically achievable concentrations ( 4 g/mL), decreased proliferation of all cancer cell lines (IC50 range of 3.7-49.7 g/mL). Eltrombopag did not increase proliferation at any eltrombopag concentration tested, consistent with very low or undetectable levels of MPL expression observed in normal tissue and 40 samples each of breast, lung, ovarian or prostate tumors. In comparison, erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) mRNA was expressed at low-to-moderate levels in lung and prostate tumors and at higher levels in ovarian and breast tumors. HER2neu/ErbB2 receptor (ERBB2) mRNA was also expressed at low-to-moderate levels in all tumor types. Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor mRNA (IGF1R) was expressed at low to undetectable levels in all tumor types.

Four out of the nine mutations, Y285C, D595V, D931Y and K935I, were found to be activating, increasing both basal and ligand-induced ErbB4 phosphorylation. According to structural analysis, the four activating mutations were located at critical positions at the dimerization interfaces of the ErbB4 extracellular (Y285C, D595V) and kinase (D931Y and K935I) domains. Consistently, the mutations enhanced ErbB4 dimerization and increased the trans activation in ErbB4 homodimers and ErbB4/ErbB2 heterodimers. The expression of the activating ERBB4 mutants promoted survival of NIH 3T3 cells in the absence of serum. Interestingly, serum starvation of NIH 3T3 cells expressing the ERBB4 mutants only moderately increased the phosphorylation of canonical ErbB signaling pathway effectors Erk1/2 and Akt as compared to wild-type ERBB4.

        "Background":"['Local mammary estrogen production may be vital for breast cancer development because about 70% of breast cancers occur in postmenopausal women. Aromatase is a key enzyme essential for estrogen biosynthesis, and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the most effective endocrine treatment for estrogen-responsive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. However, they are also accompanied a number of severe side-effects on bone and joints. Many researchers are currently focusing on developing the novel mammary-specific AIs to prevent or treat breast cancer to minimize the side effects of treatment. Phenformin, an antidiabetic drug, lowers serum glucose levels via activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and reduces tumor burden and prolongs survival in non-small cell lung cancers. In vitro studies show that activated AMPK inhibits human mammary adipose tissue aromatase expression via suppression of binding of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) to aromatase promoters I.3/II, leading to decreased estrogen formation. We hypothesized that phenformin will be an effective adipose-specific AI for prevention and treatment of breast cancer. However, one of the major obstacles to define in vivo effects of phenformin on mammary aromatase expression is the lack of suitable mouse models because aromatase expression, present in the human breast, is absent in the mouse mammary gland. We developed a unique humanized aromatase mouse model (Aromhum) to mimic the human aromatase expression pattern and physiology in the mouse. We observed that tumorigenesis was accelerated in the mice overexpressing ERBB2 that were crossed with Aromhum mice (AE mice). Phenformin treatment (i.p., 70 mg/kg /day for 14 days) significantly decreased blood glucose levels by 37% in AE mice as compared to vehicle treatment. Phosphorylation of CREB, a downstream effector of the AMPK pathway, which mediates aromatase expression, was significantly decreased. Furthermore, after phenformin administration, mammary aromatase mRNA expression in AE mice was significantly decreased by 58% and estrogen response genes (SUSD3 and cyclin D1) were also reduced by about 65%. Real-time PCR showed that mammary AMPK1 mRNA expression is 10-fold higher compared with AMPK2 mRNA. Moreover, phenformin treatment significantly decreased AMPK1 mRNA levels by 53% but not AMPK2 mRNA expression in AE mice. Interestingly, daily oral phenformin treatment for 7 days significantly reduced mammary tumor volume of AE mice by 76%. In conclusion, phenformin decreased mammary aromatase expression and possible estrogen production, and reduced tumorigenesis via upregulation of the AMPK pathway in breast tissue of AE mice. This study provides justification for future testing of the adipose-specific preventive and therapeutic potential of the metabolic drug phenformin in postmenopausal breast cancer with minimal side-effects.']",

        "Background":"['A major contributor to carcinogenesis is the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Hsp90 regulates the proper folding and stabilization of several client proteins, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). ErbB2 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor-proteins, and is a clinical target for the treatment of metastatic cancer, while HIF-1 is often stabilized and overexpressed in several cancers. The ability for Hsp90 to become a mature complex and to properly fold client proteins is dependent on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding with the co-chaperone, p23. Specific Hsp90 inhibitors, like geldanamycin, target the Hsp90 ATP-binding site to prevent formation of the mature complex. Although supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22', '6 n-3) has not been shown to specifically target the Hsp90 ATP-binding site, the current study demonstrates a similar effect by DHA causing a reduction in available intracellular ATP levels. DHA is the longest, most unsaturated omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) existing in biological membranes and has been shown to possess anti-cancer activity in several cancer models. Studies from our laboratory have shown that DHA enrichment can reduce cancer cell metabolism and intracellular ATP levels in both breast and lung cancer models. In this study, a novel mechanism for the ability of DHA to inhibit the Hsp90 chaperone complex is defined. In vitro analyses of BT-474 human breast ductal carcinoma, as well as the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines were used to determine the impact of DHA-induced decreases of intracellular ATP levels. We found that the reduction in ATP levels by DHA treatment resulted in significant decreases in the association of Hsp90 and p23 in both cell lines. The decreased association of the Hsp90-p23 complex led to decreased levels of ErbB2 and HIF-1 client proteins, suggesting that DHA can modify Hsp90 chaperone function and attenuate client protein levels. Additionally, similar results were found when employing 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a glycolytic inhibitor, which confirms that DHA and 2-DG can disrupt Hsp90 molecular chaperone function by decreasing cellular ATP levels. Consistent with these observations, when using a dose of DHA that did not significantly reduce intracellular ATP levels, no change in the Hsp90-p23 chaperone complex or protein levels of ErbB2 and HIF-1 were seen. These results demonstrate a potential use for dietary intervention to improve cancer therapy in tumors that overexpress Hsp90 client proteins.']",

Despite this high response rate, patients almost inevitably develop resistance to these drugs on average within a year of starting drug treatment. Acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs is most commonly due to the emergence of a secondary mutation (T790M) in EGFR (in 50% of cases), amplification of the genes encoding the ERBB2 and MET receptor tyrosine kinases in 12 and 5% of cases, respectively, and phenotypic transformation of the adenocarcinomas to small cell lung cancer (5% of cases). Previously, in an effort to develop strategies to overcome T790M-mediated resistance, we generated tetracycline-inducible transgenic mice that express the EGFRL858R+T790M in the lung epithelium. Upon administration of doxycycline these mice develop lung adenocarcinomas that are resistant to TKIs. However, the combination of the irreversible TKI afatinib and the EGFR antibody cetuximab showed dramatic responses in these transgenic mice. These preclinical studies led to a clinical trial of these agents, which has showing a promising 30% response rate in patients with EGFR mutant tumors resistant to TKIs. However, tumors also acquire resistance to this drug combination and the mechanisms of resistance to afatinib+cetuximab are currently unknown. We set out to identify these mechanisms using xenograft and transgenic mouse models of EGFR mutant lung cancer. Transgenic mice with EGFRL858R+T790M-induced tumors were treated with afatinib+cetuximab using an intermittent dosing strategy that we had previously used to generate erlotinib-resistant tumors in mice with EGFRL858R and EGFRDEL-induced tumors. 75% of mice develop afatinib+cetuximab resistant tumors after three month-long rounds of treatment. The same treatment strategy applied to xenografts harboring subcutaneous tumors induced by EGFRDEL+T790M gave rise to resistant tumors in 20% of cases. Analysis of the afatinib+cetuximab resistant tumors performed to date has not revealed additional mutations in the EGFR transgene, the ERBB2 kinase domain or KRAS. Additional sequencing studies and examination of signaling pathway alterations in the resistant tumors are ongoing. Uncovering mechanisms of resistance to this drug combination will allow the development of strategies to treat tumors that acquire resistance to EGFR-directed therapies.']",

To date, only a small number of ERBB2 and ERBB3 mutations have been reported and biologically characterized. Moreover, the therapeutic impact of ERBB2 or ERBB3 mutant alleles and their value as an actionable target in patients has not been validated. While ERBB2 itself cannot bind ligand, it is a potent receptor that integrates growth signals via homo- or heterodimerization with other ERBB family members.Genomic alterations increase ERBB2 kinase activity by constitutively activating the kinase domain, enabling ligand-independent receptor activation, by promoting enhanced dimerization or other mechanisms that have yet to be elucidated. Although ERBB3 has limited inherent kinase activity and cannot homodimerize, ligand stimulation promotes dimerization with active kinases like ERBB2 and EGFR that can phosphorylate ERBB2 which then promotes transformation.Thus genomic alterations in ERBB3 may be a key means of promoting oncogenic signaling despite the protein lacking robust enzymatic activity. We performed an analysis of 100 large-scale next generation sequencing datasets newly generated by our group (bladder), our institution (MSKCC-IMPACT), or found in recently published repositories (The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Broad, Genentech, Sanger, etc) to characterize the distribution and spectrum of mutations in the ERBB2 and ERBB3 genes. Data generated suggests that ERBB2 and ERBB3 mutations are highly prevalent in bladder cancer (each 10%), and recurrent, but with less frequency (<5%), in stomach, breast, colon and lung cancers. Hotspots include mutation of S310F and a cluster of residues in the kinase domain in ERBB2 and the V104M mutation in ERBB3. Preliminary analysis of 300 tumors demonstrated that ERBB2 and ERBB3 mutations present in a typically in a mutually exclusive pattern suggesting that these may be driver events with overlapping biologic effects. Generation and expression of several of these ERBB2 and ERBB3 mutants induced receptor activation, cell transformation and tumor growth in isogenic cell line and xenograft models. Treatment with the dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor, neratinib, in isogenic cell lines abrogated colony formation in soft agar and receptor activation and downstream signaling. We hope to correlate the in vitro potency of specific ERBB2 and ERBB3 mutations with drug response in patients on ongoing or future clinical trials of targeted ERBB therapies and determine the whether lineage, subclonality and co-altered genes, if present, predict for drug resistance.']",

We performed ultra-deep NGS on extracted cfDNA using a customized Illumina library preparation, hybrid capture panel covering 37 lung cancer related genes (complete exons and partial introns), and ultra-deep sequencing (HiSeq4000). Mean sequencing depth was 50,000X (150 million, 150bp reads per sample).

        "Background":"['According to a 2012 study by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), African-American women had a 41% higher rate of breast cancer mortality during 2005-2009 than did Caucasian women. Although overall cancer mortality rates have declined significantly in the U.S. since the early 1990s, the black-white mortality gap has been steadily growing. The underlying causes of this racial disparity are likely diverse, and include factors such as lower quality of care and reduced access to mammographic screening. However, more aggressive tumor biology may also contribute significantly to racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes.Recently, a low frequency single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase, W452C, which occurs predominantly in African-American women (about 10% frequency), was significantly correlated with breast cancer. This study reported that tumors from patients harboring W452C do not amplify the erbB2 (HER2) gene or overexpress the protein, suggesting that this variant may contribute to breast cancer development through a mechanism distinct from the amplification common to HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Understanding the structural and functional differences associated with W452C will allow us to identify new strategies for customized breast cancer treatments for African American women.To address the role of the W452C SNP in breast cancer we applied a cell-free in vitro reconstitution system that uses nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs) to solubilize and support functional membrane proteins. Cell-free produced wild type HER2 and W452C were tested for tyrosine phosphorylation as well as specific binding to therapeutic anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Our results showed comparable tyrosine phosphorylation levels for both wild type and W452C HER2, suggesting that the variant itself might not alone be a driver of cancer. We observed a decreased binding affinity of trastuzumab for W452C compared to wild type HER2, suggesting that W452-positive patients might not respond to trastuzumab treatment. On the other hand, we found that W452C has a higher affinity for pertuzumab. Overall, our studies suggest that the W452C variant may be differentially sensitive to clinically pertinent therapeutic agents. Further characterization of this variant will be important for the development of more effective and precise therapeutic interventions. This in turn could lead to targeted measures that help address racial disparity problems in breast cancer mortality.']",

However, the association of BCAR4 and lung cancer has not been identified. Here, we describe the oncogenic effect of BCAR4 in human lung cancer. Expression pattern of BCAR4 was examined in lung cancer cell lines, primary tumor tissues, and adjacent normal tissues. BCAR4 was highly expressed in 71% of lung cancer cell lines and especially in 43% of cancer tissues of lung adenocarcinoma patients who did not harbor the activational mutations of EGFR nor KRAS. Exogenous expression of BCAR4 protein promoted cell growth of non-tumorigenic bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, and lung cancer cell line, NCI-H1299. We also confirmed the oncogenic feature of BCAR4 by colony forming assay using stably expressing cells. These effects were notably reduced after knockdown of BCAR4 by small interfering RNA. BCAR4 encoded a functional protein and its overexpression resulted in the enhanced migration than controls cells. This result proposed a similar role of BCAR4 in lung cancer considering its previously reported role in breast cancer metastasis.

We generated a lentiviral expression library representing 53 genes and 194 somatic mutations identified in primary lung adenocarcinomas. Next, we introduced this library into A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells and 96 hours later performed gene expression profiling using Luminex-based L1000 profiling. We built a computational pipeline, eVIP, to compare mutant and wild-type expression signatures to infer whether variants were gain-of-function, change-of-function, loss-of-function, or neutral. Overall, eVIP identified 69% of mutations as impactful whereas 31% appeared functionally neutral. A very high rate, 92%, of missense mutations in the KEAP1 and STK11 tumor suppressor genes were found to inactivate or diminish protein function. As a complementary approach, we assessed which mutations are epistatic to EGFR or capable of initiating xenograft tumor formation in vivo. A subset of the impactful mutations identified by eVIP could induce xenograft tumor formation in mice and/or confer resistance to cellular EGFR inhibition. Among these mutations were 20 rare or non-canonical somatic variants in clinically-actionable or -relevant oncogenes including EGFR S645C, ARAF S214C and S214F, ERBB2 S418T, and PIK3CA E600K. eVIP can, in principle, characterize any genetic variant, independent of prior knowledge of gene function.

Six cases (37%) harboured EGFR sensitizing mutations (1 L858R; 5 exon 19 deletions), some of which had not been previously detected by other technologies. The fusion panel identified 2 additional EML4-ALK rearrangements. No overlap was found between classic driver alterations. Overall, twelve out of 16 patient samples tested (75%) harboured a genomic alteration with a target agent based on NCCN guidelines (2 EGFR L858R; 6 EGFR exon 19 deletions; 2 ERBB2 mutations, 2 EML4-ALK).

        "Background":"['A multitude of studies show that alterations in Ca2+ signalling initiate or support the development of hallmarks of cancer. In particular, the role of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in tumorigenesis and tumour progression has been subject to intense investigation. SOCE is the main mechanism by which external Ca2+ enters into the cell. It is initiated by depletion of ER Ca2+ stores and mediated by several proteins such as STIM1, an ER transmembrane protein sensing Ca2+ within the ER and ORAI1, a plasma membrane Ca2+ channel. We recently showed that SOC inhibition interfered with EGFR-dependent signalling in non-small cell lung carcinoma cells.In this study, we observed that STIM1 depletion reduced neuregulin-dependent proliferation of breast cancer cells. Since neuregulin binds to ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 and therefore activates ErbB2, this result prompted us to investigate whether ErbB proteins might modulate SOCE. We observed that lapatinib, a dual inhibitor of EGFR and ErbB2, dramatically inhibited SOCE. As expected, lapatinib also inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR, ErbB2 and downstream pathways of both receptors. Specific inhibition of EGFR by erlotinib or gefitinib had no effect on SOCE. In contrast, specific inhibition of ErbB2 by CP724714 mimicked the effects of lapatinib. We also investigated the role of downstream pathways of ErbB2 in the modulation of SOCE. Inhibition of the MAPK and the JAK-STAT pathways does not modify the amplitude of SOCE. Contrariwise, LY294002 and MK2206, two inhibitors of the PI3K pathway, dramatically reduced SOCE. Interestingly, in silico analysis showed that STIM1 might be phosphorylated by Akt.All these results suggest that SOCE is important in the proper function of ErbB2-dependent signalling. This raises the possibility to target molecular mediators of SOCE in order to interfere with the proliferation of cancer cells.']",

Thus a new paradigm for monitoring and resistance of solid tumors is currently under development\", ' sequencing the initial tumor biopsy for driver mutations followed by ultrasensitive detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using methods such as digital PCR (dPCR).In recent years, dPCR has become the gold standard for precise quantification of nucleic acids, showing detection sensitivities unparalleled by other methodologies. Picodroplet-formatted dPCR compartmentalizes the sample (and one or more assay) into a large enough number of discrete reaction volumes (e.g. 10 million) such that there is at most one target molecule per reaction. Standard qPCR reagents (target-specific primers and fluorescent hydrolysis probes) and master mixes are used for endpoint PCR amplification, resulting in plateaued fluorescent signals only in target-containing compartments. This enables digital counting of the absolute number of target molecules present in the sample volume tested.Here we report the use of the RainDrop dPCR system together with multiplexed assays measuring the most common cancer-relevant mutations in EGFR. Multiplexed primer and probe sets were designed for wild-type EGFR, T790M and L858R point mutations, and exon 19 deletions in EGFR. Using spike-in plasmid controls and genomic DNA from lung cancer cell lines (H1975,H1650), we verified simultaneous detection and discrimination of all mutations across a broad dynamic range. Finally, we demonstrated application of the multiplexed EGFR assays on matched tumor and ctDNA samples from lung cancer patients.Sensitive quantification of EGFR mutations in lung cancer patients is critical for stratifying patients into different treatment regimens, and can potentially benefit EGFR mutation-positive patients by allowing dynamic non-invasive tracking of treatment efficacy and clonal evolution. Development of a multiplexed dPCR EGFR mutation assay should facilitate personalizing lung cancer therapy and treatment management, towards the goal of monitoring disease progression for better outcomes. The RainDrop system enables sensitive simultaneous dPCR detection of multiple mutations from the same sample, which is particularly important when available sample is limited, e.g. with tumor biopsies, FFPE samples, circulating tumor cells, and ctDNA in biological fluids.']",

We performed hybrid capture exome sequencing of nearly 18,000 genes to >100X median per-sample coverage with 76bp paired-end reads. We performed whole genome sequencing achieving 60X median tumor and 20X median normal coverage with 350bp median insert size and 101bp paired-end reads. Our exome analysis yielded over 50,000 substitution and small indel coding events, with a mean somatic mutation rate of 10-11 events / MB. This resulted in over 300 non-synonymous coding events per patient, most of which were presumed to be passenger mutations unrelated to tumorigenesis. This high mutational load required us to develop novel statistical approaches (MutSig, Lawrence et al, in preparation) to identify putative lung adenocarcinoma driver genes under positive somatic selection. We constructed a complex neutral mutation model that considered sequence context and several additional genomic covariates shown to mediate gene to gene inhomogeneities of passenger mutation rates. Identification of significant deviations from this background model allowed us to recover almost all known frequently mutated lung adenocarcinoma genes, including TP53, KRAS, STK11, PIK3CA, EGFR, ERBB2, RB1, SMARCA4, and KEAP1, as well as a host of novel putative driver genes. We applied similar principles to identify pathways and sub-networks of genes undergoing apparent positive selection in lung adenocarcinoma. Whole genome analysis yielded several high-confidence in-frame protein fusion and promoter-gene fusion events enriched in tumor vs normal specimens. We also found large numbers of somatic substitution and indel events in promoters, enhancers, and non-coding DNA elements and identified putative sites of somatic retrotransposition in our whole genome data. Overall, our study eclipses previous large-scale characterization of somatic sequence variation (Refs. 1-3) in lung adenocarcinoma by at least an order of magnitude. Using novel methods adapted to the analysis of high-mutation rate tumor types (lung squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, colorectal cancer), we are able to recover signals of selection in both known and novel genes and pathways.

        "Background":"['Gene abnormalities are the cause of cancer and efforts are still needed to identify all the genes that promote carcinogenesis, including those altered at low frequencies. The occurrence of homozygous deletions (HD) is one mechanism for tumor suppressor gene inactivation. We scrutinized the SNP arrays at the Sanger Database to search for HD in lung cancer cell lines. Several candidate tumor suppressors, including PIK3R1, were found to be altered by HD. PIK3R1 codifies for p85, a regulatory subunit of the PI3K, and mutations have been found in different tumor types. The PI3K pathway is highly relevant in cancer since it contains well known oncogens and tumor suppressors. Despite that, the functional significance of PIK3R1 mutations is uncertain, because activating and inactivating alterations have been described in tumors. Here, we aimed to clarify the role of this gene in cancer. We amplified by PCR each individual exon of the gene and confirmed the presence of a HD at the NCI-H2171 cell line. Mutational analysis of PIK3R1 was then extended to a panel of 86 lung cancer cell lines. We identified several changes including an heterozygous nonsense mutation, c.211G>T (p.G71*), an heterozygous missense mutation, c.211G>T (p.D13H) and several intronic changes outside the canonical splice sites. Intriguingly, the levels of p85 protein in the cell line carrying the p.G71* mutation were almost zero, indicating the presence of a second hit. To search for the presence of intragenic small deletions, undetectable by single exon amplification, we studied the cDNA of PIK3R1. No additional alterations were detected in this cell line nor in the other cells carrying PIK3R1 heterozygous missense mutations. Next, we used cancer cell lines that have no p85 protein due to HD to determine whether the lack of p85 impinges the AKT-mTOR pathway. To this end, we tested the levels of pAKT-T308, pAKT-S473 and pS6-S235/236, upon different cell culture conditions (i.e. +/IGF) in cancer cells carrying alterations at distinct components of the PI3K pathway. We found that cells with alterations at ERBB2 and PTEN had constitutive high levels of pAKT and pS6, in all the conditions tested. Surprisingly, some cells lacking p85 protein due to HD at PIK3R1, readily regulated the activation/inactivation of the pathway, accordingly to the cell culture conditions. This indicates that the inactivation of the p85 protein in cancer does not compromise the appropriate modulation of AKT/mTOR signalling, possibly due to a compensation effect by other regulatory subunits. In conclusion, PIK3R1 is mutated in lung cancer, albeit at low frequencies. Furthermore, PIK3R1 alterations contribute to oncogenesis by mechanisms that require further investigation.']",

However, approximately one-third of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients lack tissue samples for analysis and are not eligible for targeted therapies. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), shed into the blood from tumor tissue, contain alterations specific to the genetic profile of the malignancy in tissue and can stratify patients for targeted therapies through a liquid biopsy.  Methods', '  We have developed LungSelect, a ctDNA approach to interrogate clinically actionable genetic alterations in NSCLC that are recommended by clinical guidelines or targeted in late stage clinical trials. LungSelect uses digital next-generation sequencing approaches to comprehensively examine single-base mutations, insertions and deletions in BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS and NRAS while assessing translocations in ALK, EGFR, NTRK1,RET and ROS1with a high degree of precision and accuracy.  Results', '  To evaluate the analytical sensitivity of LungSelect, we examined well characterized somatic mutations through a combination of tumor derived DNA and wild-type derived DNA at various levels of tumor contribution, achieving a lower limit of detection of > 0.01% with a specificity of > 99.9%. In addition, we examined the utility of LungSelect to detect these genetic alterations in late-stage lung cancer patients through comparison of plasma and matched tissue biopsy specimens. These analyses revealed a high concordance between the genetic alterations identified in plasma and matched tissue biopsies.  Conclusions', ' LungSelect comprehensively detects genetic alterations non-invasively, allowing for a greater proportion of patients to obtain the survival benefit associated with targeted therapies in NSCLC.']",

        "Background":"['Detection and chemoprevention of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been unsuccessful in part due to our limited knowledge of the pathogenesis of the disease. It has been suggested that normal airway epithelia share molecular abnormalities with tumors and may serve as progenitors for lung malignancies. We sought to analyze molecular profiles of lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), two major subtypes of NSCLC, and matched normal airways to elucidate aberrant expression patterns in early phases of lung tumorigenesis. All specimens were obtained from primary early stage NSCLC consented patients who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy (n=20). We profiled RNA isolated from tumors and normal lung as well as from brushings of multiple matched airways that were histologically confirmed to lack neoplastic or preneoplastic cells (n=194). Expression signatures signifying genes significantly and concurrently differentially expressed between both tumors and airways compared to normal lung tissue (tumor-airway-normal/TAN signatures) were then derived independently for SCC and smoker adenocarcinoma cases and were comprised of 1,803 and 1,938 genes, respectively. The TAN signatures effectively clustered tumor and airways from normal lung samples (p<0.001). Further analysis showed that a subset of the genes separated SCC- and adenocarcinoma-adjacent airways. Moreover, pathways and gene-network analysis using Ingenuity pathways software highlighted similarities and differences in pathway modulation between airway epithelial fields of SCCs and adenocarcinomas. Embryonic stem cell and eicosanoid signaling pathways were most significantly modulated among those common to both TAN signatures (p<0.001). Retinoic acid receptor and stem cell signaling pathways mediated by NANOG and lineage oncogene SOX2 were most significantly modulated in the SCC TAN signature, whereas NF-kB and PTEN signaling pathways were most prevalent in the adenocarcinoma TAN airway signature (all p<0.001). Gene networks mediated by lineage oncogene NKX2-1/TITF-1 down-regulation and TP63 up-regulation, and networks mediated by increased expression of the MET and ERBB2 oncogenes were predominantly functionally modulated in the SCC and adenocarcinoma TAN signatures, respectively. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed up-regulation of MET in adenocarcinomas and normal airways compared to normal lung. These findings highlight expression patterns and pathways that are deregulated differentially in the pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinomas and SCCs and thus offer detection markers as well as therapeutic targets to guide personalized chemoprevention in early stage NSCLC patients.

Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.Conclusions', 'Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs.

We recently demonstrated in head and neck cancer cells that, depending on the ErbB3 expression level and on the tumor cell phenotype (epithelial vs mesenchymal), vorinostat, one of the two clinically approved histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), differentially regulates HER receptors expression at the transcriptional level and/or by modulating protein degradation (Bruzzese F. et al. J Cell Physiol. 2011; 226(9)', '2378-90). Our group has developed a monoclonal antibody against ErbB3 called A3, that induces receptor internalization and degradation, inhibits growth and induces apoptosis only in cells overexpressing surface ErbB3 and potentiates the efficacy of EGFR TKIs (Noto A. et al. Oncotarget. 2013; 4(8)', '1253-65).In this study we first show, by using a set of malignant pleural effusion derived cell cultures from NSCLC patients (Mancini R. et al. PLOSone 2011; 6(7)', 'e21320) that the combination of the anti-ErbB3 antibody A3 with HDACi such as vorinostat or valproic acid (VPA), synergistically affect cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. Interestingly synergistic interaction was observed in both fully epithelial cells expressing all HER receptors including ErbB3, as well as in NSCLC cells that had undergone EMT and expressed very low levels of ErbB3. We provide evidences suggesting that differential modulation of ErbB receptors by HDACi is responsible for the observed synergism. We show in two epithelial cells expressing EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 that either vorinostat or VPA time- and dose-dependent down-regulation the of all three receptors expression and signaling. On the contrary, in two A3-resistant mesenchymal cells expressing undetectable levels of ErbB3, we observe time- and dose-dependent increase of mRNA and protein levels as well as surface expression of ErbB3, paralleled by down-regulation of EGFR, ErbB2 and the the mesenchymal marker vimentin. Interestingly, ErbB3 induction was achieved also at low doses of both vorinostat and VPA, corresponding to a plasma level easily reached in patients treated with these agents.Our results suggest that the combination treatment of antibodies against ErbB3 and HDACi represents an attractive strategy that warrant further evaluation, even in combination with other agents, for the treatment of NSCLC patients.']",

Except ERBB2/ERBB3 gene amplification, other mechanism(s) of ERBB2 and ERBB3 overexpression remains elusive. Recent studies show that aberrant expressions of miRNAs are associated with cancer development. To identify specific miRNAs for regulating ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression, we find that miR-199a and miR-125b directly target ERBB2 and ERBB3, and are downregulated in ovarian tissues and cancer cells. Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been observed in tumor growth and drug resistance.

This study describes a novel observation that ErbB2 localizes in mitochondria of multiple cancer cell lines and patient samples.We identified an endogenous mitochondrial targeting sequence in ErbB2 and found that ErbB2 translocates into mitochondria through the association with mtHSP70, a key player in the canonical mitochondrial protein importation pathway. Additionally, we observed that mitochondrial ErbB2 (mtErbB2) negatively regulates mitochondrial respiratory functions. Oxygen consumption and activities of complex I, II and IV of the mitochondrial electron transport chain were decreased in mtErbB2-overexpressing cells. Mitochondrial membrane potential and the cellular ATP level also were decreased by mtErbB2. In contrast, mtErbB2 enhanced cellular glycolysis. The translocation of ErbB2 and its impact on mitochondrial function are kinase dependent. Mitochondrial ErbB2 regulates the phosphorylation and activity of COX II and consequently the cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Additional studies showed that cancer cells with higher levels of mtErbB2 were more resistant to Trastuzumab and deletion of the mitochondrial targeting sequence of ErbB2 sensitized the cells to Trastuzumab.Our study provides a novel perspective on the metabolic regulatory functions of ErbB2 and reveals that mtErbB2 plays an important role in the regulation of cellular metabolism and cancer cell resistance to therapeutics.

In 42 samples (23.2%) hotspot mutations were found in genes other than the EGFR, such as KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, PIK3CA or MET, which might cause primary resistance to EGFR targeting drugs. In 29 samples the additional mutations were at an allelic frequency >5%, and in 13 at a frequency >2% and <5%. All mutations at low allelic frequency for which material was available were confirmed by ddPCR (N.5). The allele frequency of the driver EGFR mutation and of the additional mutations were usually different, suggesting the sub-clonal origin of some driver mutations. In particular, in 15/42 cases the EGFR mutant allele frequency was lower as compared with the additional driver mutation.Conclusion. These preliminary data suggest that a subgroup of EGFR mutant tumors have intra-tumor heterogeneity and are likely to carry tumor clones with different molecular profile. Follow-up data are being collected to assess whether this phenomenon might affect the activity of first line EGFR TKIs.']",

        "Background":"['Deregulation of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases has been widely implicated in cancer initiation and progression. Activating mutations or gene amplification of EGFR and ERBB2 (HER2) are frequently found in non-small cell lung, breast, colorectal, glioblastoma and head and neck cancers. However, little is known regarding the prevalence or functionality of genomic alterations in the ERBB3 (HER3) isoform. Although ERBB3 has limited inherent kinase activity, ligand stimulation promotes its dimerization with active kinases like ERBB2 and EGFR that can phosphorylate ERBB3 which then promotes transformation. Thus genomic alterations in ERBB3 may be a key means of promoting oncogenic signaling despite the protein lacking robust enzymatic activity. We performed a meta-analysis of 40 cross-cancer next generation sequencing and copy number genomics data sets newly generated by our group (bladder) or found in recently published repositories (The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Broad, Genentech, Sanger, etc). Analogous to the singular 2013 publication on ERBB3 mutations to date, we found frequent mutations in ERBB3 in gastric tumors (11%). Preliminary analysis of our novel and expanding cohort of 109 high-grade bladder cancer tumors suggests that ERBB3 mutations are equally frequent in bladder cancer (10-12%). Collectively, EGFR, ERBB2 and ERBB3 alterations were found in 23-30% of all high-grade bladder cancers, typically in a mutually exclusive pattern suggesting that these may be driver events. ERBB3 mutations were distributed across all structural domains of the protein. We identified more than 15 novel ERBB3 mutations in our bladder cohort, including hotspot mutations in the extracellular domain (V104L/M, D297Y, others) that were recurrent across multiple cancers types. Stable retroviral overexpression of ERBB3 mutants into NIH-3T3 cells induced phosphorylation of ERBB3, activation of downstream signaling cascades and soft agar colony formation, all which were enhanced in the presence of neuregulin and inhibited by the dual EGFR/ERBB2 kinase inhibitor, neratinib, and a monoclonal antibody to ERBB3, AMG-888/U3-1287. These data highlight a large cohort of bladder cancer patients with novel, activating mutations in the tractable kinase ERBB3, that could potentially benefit from approved EGFR/ERBB2 targeted therapeutics in the clinic and novel ERBB3 therapeutics in early clinical trials.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Most of targetable gene alterations are found only in 1-5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases. Large scale screening systems for these rare populations are necessary for the development of molecular targeted therapies. Thus, a nationwide lung cancer genomic screening project in Japan (LC-SCRUM-Japan) has been operated since February 2013. Methods', ' Non-squamous NSCLCs without EGFR mutations were eligible for inclusion in this study. The tumors were analyzed for ALK/RET/ROS1 fusions using RT-PCR, and detected fusions were confirmed by FISH. Since March 2015, this nationwide project has been amended to an academic-industrial collaboration project with 14 pharmaceutical companies, and the samples were further subjected to a next-generation sequencing (NGS) system, Oncomine Comprehensive Assay, enabling the simultaneous analysis of 143 cancer-related genes. Results', ' As of December 31, 2015, 195 institutions across Japan were participating and 2161 patients had been enrolled. Among 1988 available samples, including 497 for the NGS analysis, ALK/RET/ROS1 fusions were detected in 37 (2%)/51 (3%)/86 (4%), respectively. The NGS analysis also showed that 269 cases (54%) had targetable gene alterations, including 82 KRAS mutations (17%), 36 ERBB2 mutations (7%), 28 BRAF mutations (6%), 22 PIK3CA mutations (4%), 6 NRAS mutations (1%), 6 MAP2K1 mutations (1%) and 2 FGFR2 fusions (0.4%). MET/ERBB2/FGFR1 amplifications were also detected by the NGS in 13 (3%)/11 (2%)/3 (1%) cases, respectively. Through this screening, the preplanned numbers of patient with RET and ROS1 fusions (n = 19 and 26, respectively) were successfully enrolled in clinical trials of vandetanib (LURET study in Japan) and of crizotinib (OO12-01 study in East Asia), respectively. Three patients with ERBB2 alterations and 2 with MET amplifications were also enrolled in genotype-matched ongoing trials. Conclusions', ' This nationwide screening system enables efficiently and successfully detecting various targetable gene alterations in NSCLC, thereby contributing to promote cancer precision medicine through the development of targeted therapies.']",

LCMC I collectively enrolled 1102 patients from 14 institutions with the goal of performing molecular analysis to identify therapy options. Technical aspects of the genomic testing, specimen and clinical correlations are presented.  Methods', '  Testing for mutations in 8 genes (EGFR, KRAS, ERBB2, AKT1, BRAF, MEK1, NRAS, PIK3CA), and analysis of ALK and MET by FISH, was performed at 6 labs. Proficiency testing was carried out with blinded samples. Statistical analyses were performed for analysis completion, specimen types, testing methodology, mutation findings and clinical variables.  Results', '  Five methodologies (SNaPshot, mass spectrometry, Sanger +/- PNA, sizing) were variably employed for detection of mutations, with analytic sensitivities of ~5% allele frequency. All sites passed proficiency testing. 1006 specimens had at least one mutation analysis completed, 733 specimens had full genotyping results. Mutation detection rates did not vary according to method of analysis.  Higher rates of specimen inadequacy were seen in biopsy (36/136; 23%) and cytology (23/65; 36%) compared to surgical (13/268; 5%) specimens at the site that analyzed the most cases. Biopsy and cytology samples, when acceptable showed no difference in mutation or FISH assay completion or positivity rate. Multiple analyses are summarized in the table. Double mutations were seen in 3.8% of samples.  Conclusions', '  Molecular analysis is possible in a multi-institutional setting with consistent results. Cytology and small biopsy specimens were commonly sufficient for multiplex testing, although sample insufficiency was a common reason for exclusion (53% of excluded cases), and contributed to lack of assay completion. Multiple associations were identified between specific mutations and clinicopathologic features.']",

Thus, development of molecular markers for SDC will be important to guide the diagnosis and therapy of this aggressive tumor. We performed next-generation sequencing using the Ion Torrent AmpliSeq cancer panel, which explores the mutational status of hotspot regions in 50 cancer-associated genes, and we analyzed copy number variations (CNVs) of 21 genes by NanoString nCounter for 37 patients with SDC. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was also conducted to confirm ERBB2 gene amplification. Clinical records and tumor histopathology of the patients were retrospectively reviewed. Genetic alterations were detected in 29 of 37 (78.3%) tumors, including mutations in PIK3CA (N = 9, 24.3%), ERBB2 (N = 4, 10.8%), and EGFR (N = 4, 10.8%). To our knowledge, this is the first time that ERBB2 mutations have been reported in this tumor type. Both PIK3CA and ERBB2 mutation status were associated with poor overall survival, but without statistical significance. ERBB2 amplification was strong and common in SDC and almost all cases also exhibited EGFR and ERBB3 amplifications. This study reports the largest and most comprehensive analysis of DNA aberrations in SDC. Our results show that PIK3CA and/or ERBB2 alterations in the development of SDC might be a useful diagnostic tool and could serve as a potential therapeutic target.Key words', ' Salivary duct carcinoma, next-generation sequencing, molecular markers, PIK3CA, ERBB2, EGFR']",
