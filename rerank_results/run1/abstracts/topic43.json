Mutations in the PTCH1 (PTCH) gene are responsible for NBCCS and are related in tumors associated with this syndrome. Mutations in the SMO gene have been identified in basal cell carcinoma and in medulloblastoma, both of which are features of NBCCS. To clarify the role of PTCH1 and SMO in KCOTs, we undertook mutational analysis of PTCH1 and SMO in 20 sporadic and 10 NBCCS-associated KCOTs, and for SMO, 20 additional cases of KCOTs with known PTCH1 status were also included. Eleven novel (1 of which occurred twice) and 5 known PTCH1 mutations were identified. However, no pathogenic mutation was detected in SMO. Our findings suggest that mutations are rare in SMO, but frequent in PTCH1 in sporadic and NBCCS-associated KCOTs.;NBCCS, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome; KCOTs, keratocystic odontogenic tumors; BCCs, basal cell carcinomas.",

It is characterized by developmental anomalies and predisposition to tumors (for example, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and medulloblastoma). PTCH1, the human homolog of the Drosophila patched gene, was identified as a gene responsible for BCNS. The PTCH1 protein is a Hedgehog (Hh) protein receptor and is pivotal for early development, stem cell maintenance and/or differentiation. We analyzed the six Japanese families with BCNS and identified six germline mutations in the PTCH1 gene. One family had a nonsense mutation (c.1196G>A), one had a 1-bp deletion (c.2029delA), two had 2-bp deletions (c.239_240delGA and c.1670_1671delCA) and one had a 58-bp duplication (c.1138_1195dup). They caused premature termination, resulting in the truncation of the PTCH1 protein. Analysis of a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping array showed a large approximately 1.2-Mb deletion, including the PTCH1 gene in one allele, in a family in which PTCH1 mutations were not identified at the sequence level. These data indicated that all the six families who were diagnosed with BCNS had mutations in the PTCH1 gene and that a single copy of a PTCH1 mutation causes BCNS.",

Ptch1 is best known as a tumor suppressor, as germline or somatic mutations in Ptch1 lead to the formation of skin basal cell carcinomas. Here we show that Ptch1 also acts as a lineage-dependent oncogene, as overexpression of Ptch1 in adult skin in K14Ptch(FVB) transgenic mice synergizes with chemically induced Hras mutations to promote squamous carcinoma development. These effects were not because of aberrant activation of SHH signaling by the K14Ptch(FVB) transgene, as developmental defects in the highest expressing transgenic lines were consistent with the inhibition of this pathway. Carcinomas from K14Ptch(FVB) transgenic mice had only a small number of nonproliferative Ptch1 transgene-positive cells, suggesting that the Ptch1 transgene is not required for tumor maintenance, but may have a critical role in cell-fate determination at the initiation stage.",

Five mutations were localized within the invariant GT-AG splice site, whereas the other five mutations occurred outside the invariant GT-AG site including the last exonic nucleotide. When the transcripts were examined, all mutations resulted in aberrant splicing, including exon skipping or the activation of cryptic splice sites. This is the first extensive report of NBCCS focusing on splice site mutations, and it highlights the importance of analyzing transcripts especially for mutations lying outside the GT-AG splicing consensus site. In addition, the splice site score calculated by Splice-Site Analyzer Tool provided by Tel Aviv University helped predict aberrant splice patterns in most of the cases.",

PTCH1 is part of the hedgehog signalling pathway, and derangements within this pathway are now known to be important in the carcinogenesis of many different cancers including sporadic basal cell carcinoma. The molecular biology of the hedgehog pathway is discussed, and mouse models of basal cell carcinoma based on this pathway are explored. New developments in non-surgical treatment of basal cell carcinoma are based on this knowledge. Other genes of importance to basal cell carcinoma development include the tumour suppressor gene P53 and the melanocortin-1 receptor gene. In addition, we discuss molecules of possible importance such as the glutathione-S-transferases, DNA repair genes, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, Brahma and connexins.

His 43 years old mother has NBCCS diagnosis and no history of BCCs. For a deeper study, PTCH1 mutation screening from peripheral blood samples were performed by both bidirectional sequencing and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) techniques. The proband and his mother carry 25 pb duplication in exon 10 (c.1375dupl25bp) that causes a reading frameshift with a premature stop codon. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that this mutation results in a truncated protein shorter than normal.

NBCCS is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited disease mainly characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas, KCOTs of the jaws and a variety of other tumors. PTCH1 mutation can be found both in sporadic or NBCCS associated KCOTs. The aim of the current study was to assess whether a combined clinical and bio-molecular approach could be suitable for the detection of NBCCS among patients with a diagnosis of keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOTs). The authors collected keratocystic odontogenic tumors recorded in the database of the Pathology Department of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia during the period 1991-2011. Through interviews and examinations, family pedigrees were drawn for all patients affected by these odontogenic lesions. We found out that 18 of the 70 patients with KCOTs and/or multiple basal cell carcinomas actually met the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of NBCCS. A wide inter- and intra-familial phenotypic variability was evident in the families. Ameloblastomas (AMLs) were reported in two probands that are also carriers of the PCTH1 germline mutations. Nine germline mutations in the PTCH1 gene, 5 of them novel, were evident in 14 tested probands. The clinical evaluation of the keratocystic odontogenic tumors can be used as screening for the detection of families at risk of NBCCS. Keratocystic odontogenic lesions are uncommon, and their discovery deserves the search for associated cutaneous basal cell carcinomas and other benign and malignant tumors related to NBCCS.",

Therefore ODC is a potentially important target for chemoprevention of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), the majority of which have mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene known as patched (PTCH). To assess this possibility, we first overexpressed ODC in the skin of Ptch1+/- mice using a keratin 6 (K6) promoter that directs constitutive ODC expression in the outer root sheath of the hair follicle. UVB irradiation of these mice accelerated induction of BCCs as compared with their Ptch1+/- littermates. To further verify the role of ODC in BCC tumorigenesis, we used an antizyme (AZ) approach to inhibit ODC activity in the Ptch1+/- mice. Ptch1+/- mice with AZ overexpression driven by the K6 promoter were resistant to the induction of BCCs by UVB. Furthermore, oral administration of the suicidal ODC inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine reduced UVB-induced BCCs in Ptch1+/- mice.

The epithelial Ki67 labeling in OKCs with PTCH1 mutation was significantly higher than that in cases with no PTCH1 mutation. Furthermore, OKCs harboring PTCH1 truncation-causing mutations showed an even greater Ki67 labeling index than those with non-truncation-causing mutations.

Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTCH1 are responsible for this autosomal dominant syndrome. In NBCCS patients, as in the general population, ultraviolet exposure is a major risk factor for BCC development. However these patients also develop BCCs in sun-protected areas of the skin, suggesting the existence of other mechanisms for BCC predisposition in NBCCS patients. As increasing evidence supports the idea that the stroma influences carcinoma development, we hypothesized that NBCCS fibroblasts could facilitate BCC occurence of the patients. WT (n = 3) and NBCCS fibroblasts bearing either nonsense (n = 3) or missense (n = 3) PTCH1 mutations were cultured in dermal equivalents made of a collagen matrix and their transcriptomes were compared by whole genome microarray analyses. Strikingly, NBCCS fibroblasts over-expressed mRNAs encoding pro-tumoral factors such as Matrix Metalloproteinases 1 and 3 and tenascin C. They also over-expressed mRNA of pro-proliferative diffusible factors such as fibroblast growth factor 7 and the stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha, known for its expression in carcinoma associated fibroblasts.

Genotype-phenotype correlation has not been established. PTCH1 is a member of hedgehog signaling, which is a highly conserved pathway in vertebrates, composed of hedgehog, SMO, and GLI proteins as well as PTCH1. Given that hedgehog signaling regulates cell growth and development, disorder of this pathway gives rise to not only developmental anomalies but also diverse tumors such as those seen in Gorlin syndrome. We recently reported, for the first time, a nationwide survey of Gorlin syndrome in Japan, noting that the frequency was 1/235,800 in the Japanese population, and that the frequency of basal cell carcinomas was significantly lower in Japan than in the USA and Europe, suggesting that ethnicity and genetic background contribute to these differences.

However, previous studies have revealed that more than 85% of syndromic KCOTs and less than 30% of sporadic KCOTs harbor PTCH1 mutations. The significantly lower PTCH1 mutation rates observed in sporadic KCOTs suggest that they serve a minor role in pathogenesis. We aimed to discern the importance of PTCH1 mutations in sporadic KCOTs.;PTCH1 mutational analysis was performed with 19 new sporadic KCOT cases by direct sequencing of epithelial lining samples separated from fibrous capsules. Using this approach, we further reexamined 9 sporadic KCOTs that were previously reported to lack PTCH1 mutations by our group.;Nineteen PTCH1 mutations were detected in patient samples from 16/19 new cases (84%) all these mutations were absent in fibrous tissues and peripheral blood specimens from the same patients. We also identified four PTCH1 mutations in 3/9 patients (33%) that were previously undetected.;These data indicated that PTCH1 mutations occur in sporadic KCOTs at a higher rate than previously suspected, owing to the masking effects of the attached stromal tissues in the test samples.

Mutations in PTCH1 lead to constitutive expression of HH target genes and a relationship between mutated PTCH1 and the most common tumor form in the Western world, Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) has been clearly established. We here show that PTCH1 is transcriptionally regulated by three independent promoters generating transcripts with alternative first exons. We demonstrate that only one of two putative Gli-binding sites that were identified in the promoter region of PTCH1 is functional, and that the transactivating Gli proteins, GLI1, Gli2 and GLI3, bind and enhance transcription through this site. Moreover, a strong repression of both basal and induced PTCH1 transcription was observed following expression of a truncated version of GLI3. Most interestingly, the upstream components in the HH-signaling cascade, Sonic HH (SHH) and SMOH, solely operate through the functional Gli-binding site because mutation of the Gli-binding site resulted in the disappearance of the enhanced transcription induced by the Gli proteins, as well as by SHH or SMOH. This finding suggests that transcriptional activation of the PTCH1 gene mediated via the HH-signaling pathway is dependent on the single functional Gli-binding site.",

Mice in which one copy of Ptch1 is inactivated show increased susceptibility to spontaneous tumor development and hypersensitivity to radiation-induced tumorigenesis, providing an ideal in vivo model to study the typical pathologies associated with basal cell nevus syndrome. We therefore examined BCC development in control and irradiated Ptch1(neo67/+) mice. We show that unirradiated mice develop putative BCC precursor lesions, i.e., basaloid hyperproliferation areas arising from both follicular and interfollicular epithelium, and that these lesions progress to nodular and infiltrative BCCs only in irradiated mice. Data of BCC incidence, multiplicity, and latency support the notion of epidermal hyperproliferations, nodular and infiltrative BCC-like tumors representing different stages of tumor development. This is additionally supported by the pattern of p53 protein expression observed in BCC subtypes and by the finding of retention of the normal remaining Ptch1 allele in all nodular, circumscribed BCCs analyzed compared with its constant loss in infiltrative BCCs. Our data suggest chronological tumor progression from basaloid hyperproliferations to nodular and then infiltrative BCC occurring in a stepwise fashion through the accumulation of sequential genetic alterations.",

Computer-assisted reconstruction shows that these nests join in three dimensions, but it remains unknown whether this tumour is monoclonal. An early event in BCC formation, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the Patched 1 (Ptch1) locus, can be used as a tool to address whether this tumour is monoclonal.;To determine whether superficial BCC is monoclonal by analysing individually microdissected superficial BCC nests and looking for the same pattern of LOH in each.;Six cases of superficial BCC were analysed for LOH at the Ptch1 gene locus using the D9S287 microsatellite marker. Identical allelic patterns were sought in each nest from a given tumour. These patterns were no allelic loss, loss of the shorter allele or loss of the longer allele, each with a respective probability of occurrence, as estimated from published findings.;All cases were informative. Four cases showed no LOH in each nest and two showed loss of the same allele. If these nests arose independently, then the probability of this result was between 4 x 10-11 and 2 x 10-14. The lack of LOH, seen in four cases, could be due to monoclonal expansion of a cell retaining both D9S287 alleles, or due to a polyclonal proliferation. Therefore, a separate analysis excluding these cases was done, giving a probability of between 2.2 x 10-4 and 1.0 x 10-7.;These probabilities were so extreme that it was unlikely that the nests arose independently, thus providing the first molecular evidence that superficial BCC is monoclonal.",

We have previously shown that downregulation of PTCH1 is distinctive for this type of colorectal cancer. In several other tumor types, somatic inactivating PTCH1 mutations have been shown to lead to aberrant Hedgehog signaling, but in colorectal cancer the role of PTCH1 mutations has not been thoroughly studied. Here, we have analyzed the mutation status of PTCH1 in a series of 33 colorectal serrated adenocarcinomas by sequencing all 23 coding exons. We detected 11 previously known SNPs and eight new alterations. The latter included five synonymous changes and two previously unknown missense variations, somatic M319V, and germline V1231A. V1231A was also present in population controls and likely represents polymorphism. The somatic M319V variant does not appear to be an attractive candidate for a disease-associated mutation because in silico analyses did not support the pathogenic nature of the change. A somatic, intronic 1-bp deletion was detected in a short poly(T) stretch in two microsatellite unstable tumors. None of the three changes had predicted effect on splicing when analyzed in silico. Our results did not reveal any clearly deleterious inactivating PTCH1 mutations in our collection of colorectal serrated adenocarcinomas. This suggests that other mechanisms are involved in the observed downregulation of the PTCH1 gene. These might include, e.g., constantly active MAPK signaling by KRAS or BRAF mutations or silencing of PTCH1 by hypermethylation, and further studies are needed to reveal these mechanisms.",

The possibility of underlying genetic abnormalities in these familial BCCs has not been explored previously. The present study investigated a possible genetic abnormality in two members of a family with multiple nonsyndromic BCCs. The possibility of Gorlin syndrome in this family was excluded by both the absence of any clinical and radiological features and the lack of mutation in PTCH1. Notably, whole-genome comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) identified a microdeletion in chromosome 22q11.1 in both of the studied cases. A tiling path CGH array of the 22q11.1 region confirmed this microdeletion and mapped it between 14.46 and 14.5 Mb on chromosome 22q.

Analogously, skin carcinogenesis-susceptible (Car-S) mice are elective for studies of papilloma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) induction. We previously reported a striking effect of gender on BCC induction in Ptch1(+/-) mice, with total resistance of females; likewise, Car-S females show increased skin tumor resistance relative to males. Here, we investigated the protective role of endogenous estrogen in skin keratinocyte tumorigenesis. Control (CN) and ovariectomized Ptch1(+/-) or Car-S females were irradiated for BCC induction or topically treated with chemical carcinogens for SCC induction. Susceptibility to BCC or SCC was dramatically increased in ovariectomized Ptch1(+/-) and Car-S females and restored to levels observed in males. Remarkably, progression of initially benign papillomas to malignant SCC occurred only in ovariectomized Car-S females. We explored the mechanisms underlying tumor progression and report overexpression of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha, downregulation of ERbeta and upregulation of cyclin D1 in papillomas from ovariectomized Car-S relative to papillomas from CN females. Thus, an imbalanced ERalpha/ERbeta expression may be associated with estrogen-mediated modulation of non-melanoma skin carcinogenesis, with a key role played by cyclin D1. Our findings underscore a highly protective role of endogenous estrogen against skin tumorigenesis by diverse agents in two independent mouse models of skin cancer.",

The objective of the current study was to evaluate whether a combined clinical and biomolecular approach could be useful for the identification of NBCCS among patients with a diagnosis of ameloblastoma. The authors collected ameloblastoma tumors recorded in the databases of the Pathology Departments of the University of Modena during the period 1991-2011. Family trees were drawn for all 41 patients affected by these specific odontogenic tumors. Two patients with ameloblastoma were also affected by multiple basal cell carcinomas and odontogenic keratocysts tumors (OKCTs) achieving the requested clinical criteria for the diagnosis of NBCCS. The clinical diagnoses were confirmed by the identification of two different novel PTCH1 germline mutations (c.2186AÂ >Â T [p.K729Â M]; c.931insA) in those unrelated patients. Clinical ameloblastoma findings can be used as screening for the identification of families at risk of NBCCS.

The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the Sonic hedgehog pathway in the pathogenesis of the CEOT. We evaluated the protein distribution of PTCH and the transcription factors Gli1 and Gli2 within seven cases using immunohistochemistry. We also sought to confirm the findings by sequencing the PTCH1 gene from DNA extracted from the paraffin-embedded tissue of these cases. Seven cases of paraffin-embedded CEOT specimens were analyzed with immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity for Sonic hedgehog pathway proteins was evaluated using antibodies to the receptor PTCH as well as to the transcription factors Gli1 and Gli2. A keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KOT) from a 12year-old with NBCCS served as our positive control. Normal salivary gland tissue served as our negative control. PTCH gene sequencing was completed using PCR. Immunoreactivity to PTCH was seen in 6/7 cases, to Gli1 in 6/7 cases and to Gli2 in 6/7 cases. All three proteins were positive in the syndromic KOT and all proteins were negative in normal salivary tissue. Gene sequencing revealed five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of which two resulted in missense mutations. A missense mutation was also detected in the KOT.

TMZ resistant GBM cells have increased PTCH1 mRNA and reduced protein. Knockdown of Dicer, a Type III RNAase, indicated that miRNAs can explain the decreased PTCH1 in TMZ resistant cells. Computational studies, real-time PCR, reporter gene studies, western blots, target protector oligos and ectopic expression identified miR-9 as the target of PTCH1 in resistant GBM cells with concomitant activation of SHH signaling.

The patient was referred to our hospital owing to abdominal distension. On admission, a huge elastic hard tumor was palpable and computed tomography showed a huge tumor of the left ovary. We performed a left salpingo-oophorectomy and diagnosed the tumor as a benign fibroma. Further examination of the computed tomography images showed skeletal abnormalities. In addition, the patient had a history of medulloblastoma at the age of 4Â years. Therefore, we diagnosed NBCCS. A genetic examination indicated a novel 1Â bp deletion in exon 18 (c.3055delG). Sequence analysis of exon 18 using DNA from the ovarian tumor revealed a mutant allele (c.3055delG) dominant to the wild-type allele, thus suggesting loss of heterozygosity in the PTCH1 gene, which is known to be associated with NBCCS. Conclusion On the basis of our experience, physicians treating pediatric ovarian tumors should be aware that such huge benign ovarian tumors may be a phenotype of NBCCS, as shown in our patient.

Causative mutations for NBCCS occur in the PTCH1 gene on chromosome 9q22.3-q31, which encodes the principle receptor for the Hedgehog signalling pathway. We have investigated the molecular basis of craniofacial defects seen in NBCCS using a transgenic mouse model expressing Shh in basal epithelium under a Keratin-14 promoter. These mice have an absence of flat bones within the skull vault, hypertelorism, open-bite malocclusion, cleft palate and arrested tooth development. Significantly, increased Hedgehog signal transduction in these mice can influence cell fate within the craniofacial region. In medial edge epithelium of the palate, Shh activity prevents apoptosis and subsequent palatal shelf fusion. In contrast, high levels of Shh in odontogenic epithelium arrests tooth development at the bud stage, secondary to a lack of cell proliferation in this region. These findings illustrate the importance of appropriately regulated Hedgehog signalling during early craniofacial development and demonstrate that oro-facial clefting and hypodontia seen in NBCCS can occur as a direct consequence of increased Shh signal activity within embryonic epithelial tissues.",

The PTCH1 gene at 9q22 is also considered as a candidate tumor suppressor in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), of which >50% show LOH in this region. However, only rare mutations have been found in PTCH1. We have therefore investigated GLI-dependent promoter activity and expression of hedgehog pathway components in TCC cell lines and proliferating normal urothelial cells. Normal urothelial cells cultured in serum-free medium, but not TCC lines exhibited low, but significant promoter activity under standard growth conditions. Accordingly, GLI1-3 and PTCH1 mRNAs were expressed at moderate levels, and sonic hedgehog (SHH) mRNA expression was low to undetectable. In co-transfection experiments GLI1 increased promoter activity significantly in one TCC line and further in normal urothelial cells, but less strongly in other TCC lines. Expression patterns of GLI factor mRNAs did not correlate with inducibility. No significant effects of SHH or cyclopamine on proliferation were observed, ruling out autocrine effects. However, SHH induced GLI-dependent promoter activity in normal urothelial cells. Taken together, our data suggest that the hedgehog pathway is weakly active in normal adult urothelial cells and of limited importance in TCC.",

NBCCS is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease with an estimated prevalence of 1:150,000 and diagnosis of this syndrome is often an accidental finding of radiological investigations. The purpose of this study was to report the varied radiological and dermatological manifestations of our patients affected with NBCCS and to present this rare syndrome as a differential diagnosis of skeletal anomalies.;Between 1994 and 2005 the demographic, clinical, radiological and histological data of 8 patients with NBCCS were retrospectively analyzed. Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome was diagnosed in the event of two major or one major and two minor criteria. The major criteria are more than 2 basal cell carcinoma, odontogenic keratocysts, three or more palmar pits, and calcification of the falx cerebri.;Between 1994 and 2005 8 patients (3 females and 5 males) with NBCCS were treated in our departments. The average age at the time of diagnosis of NBCCS was 49.9 years. All patients had a minimum of two major criteria. The major criteria with the most frequency were the basal cell carcinoma (6 patients) and the odontogenic keratocysts (5 patients), followed by the calcification of the falx cerebri and palmoplantar pits (4 patients). There was no gender-related or age-related predilection and only one patient was affected with pain in his fingers which radiologically correlated to small cystic bone lesions (\"flame-shaped lucencies\").;Due to limitations in identification of mutations in the PTCH1 gene, clinical and radiological examination still remains a very important factor in the treatment of patients suffering from NBCCS. The knowledge of the varied skeletal manifestations and constellations is therefore essential and correlates with therapeutic consequences. Often chest, rib, spine, skull, and jaw X-rays show the way. Due to the risk of the development of an associated medulloblastoma, neurological surveillance in 6-month intervals in addition to an annual MRI of the cerebrum up to an age of 7 is strongly recommended.",

The role of PTCH1 in colon carcinogenesis, however, is controversial. The aim of the present study was to investigate epigenetic modifications of PTCH1 in aberrant crypt foci (ACF), the earliest precursor lesion of colorectal cancer (CRC). Using laser-capture microdissection (LCM), a pure population of ACF epithelial cells was isolated and studied. The inherent protein expression levels of SHH, PTCH1, SMO and GLI1 were assessed by immunohistochemistry for 405 ACF, including 54 dysplastic ACF (d-ACF) and 351 non-dysplastic ACF (n-ACF). The mRNA levels and methylation status of PTCH1 were also determined in 54 d-ACF and 96 n-ACF. Our data showed that the expression of SHH, SMO and GLI1 was significantly up-regulated in d-ACF, compared to n-ACF. Also, the mRNA and protein levels of PTCH1 were lower in d-ACF than n-ACF. Using MSP or MS-HRM, PTCH1 methylation was present in 64.8% (35/54) or 63.3% (34/54), respectively, of d-ACF and 19.8% (19/96) or 22.9% (11/48), respectively, of n-ACF. PTCH1 methylation was more frequent in d-ACF than n-ACF (p < 0.001) and was associated with PTCH1 mRNA levels (r = 0.358, p < 0.01). There was a statistically significant correlation between PTCH1 methylation status and the prevalence of colorectal neoplasms. In conclusion, this study suggests that aberrant methylation of the PTCH1 promoter may be an early, initiating event of colon carcinogenesis.",

A subset of medulloblastoma originates from granule cell precursors (GCPs) of the developing cerebellum and demonstrates aberrant hedgehog signaling, typically due to inactivating mutations in the receptor PTCH1, a pathomechanism recapitulated in Ptch1(+/-) mice. As nitric oxide may regulate GCP proliferation and differentiation, we crossed Ptch1(+/-) mice with mice lacking inducible nitric oxide synthase (Nos2) to investigate a possible influence on tumorigenesis. We observed a two-fold higher medulloblastoma rate in Ptch1(+/-) Nos2(-/-) mice compared to Ptch1(+/-) Nos2(+/+) mice. To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this finding, we performed gene expression profiling of medulloblastomas from both genotypes, as well as normal cerebellar tissue samples of different developmental stages and genotypes. Downregulation of hedgehog target genes was observed in postnatal cerebellum from Ptch1(+/+) Nos2(-/-) mice but not from Ptch1(+/-) Nos2(-/-) mice. The most consistent effect of Nos2 deficiency was downregulation of growth-associated protein 43 (Gap43). Functional studies in neuronal progenitor cells demonstrated nitric oxide dependence of Gap43 expression and impaired migration upon Gap43 knock-down. Both effects were confirmed in situ by immunofluorescence analyses on tissue sections of the developing cerebellum. Finally, the number of proliferating GCPs at the cerebellar periphery was decreased in Ptch1(+/+) Nos2(-/-) mice but increased in Ptch1(+/-) Nos2(-/) (-) mice relative to Ptch1(+/-) Nos2(+/+) mice. Taken together, these results indicate that Nos2 deficiency promotes medulloblastoma development in Ptch1(+/-) mice through retention of proliferating GCPs in the external granular layer due to reduced Gap43 expression. This study illustrates a new role of nitric oxide signaling in cerebellar development and demonstrates that the localization of pre-neoplastic cells during morphogenesis is crucial for their malignant progression.",

Here, we provide direct evidence for a critical role of HH signaling in bladder carcinogenesis. We show that transformed human urothelial cells and many urothelial carcinoma cell lines exhibit constitutive HH signaling, which is required for their growth and tumorigenic properties. Surprisingly, rather than originating from loss of PTCH1, the constitutive HH activity observed in urothelial carcinoma cell lines was HH ligand dependent. Consistent with this finding, increased levels of HH and the HH target gene product GLI1 were found in resected human primary bladder tumors. Furthermore, on the basis of the difference in intrinsic HH dependence of urothelial carcinoma cell lines, a gene expression signature was identified that correlated with bladder cancer progression.

Computational analysis of the pathway suggests three mechanisms that could contribute to this adaptation: transcriptional upregulation of the inhibitory receptor Ptch1, transcriptional downregulation of Gli and the differential stability of active and inactive Gli isoforms. Consistent with this, Gli2 protein expression is downregulated during neural tube patterning and adaptation continues when the pathway is stimulated downstream of Ptch1. Moreover, the Shh-induced upregulation of Gli2 transcription prevents Gli activity levels from adapting in a different cell type, NIH3T3 fibroblasts, despite the upregulation of Ptch1. Multiple mechanisms therefore contribute to the intracellular dynamics of Shh signalling, resulting in different signalling dynamics in different cell types. ",

PTCH1 normally functions by repressing the activity of the Smoothened (SMO) receptor. Inactivating PTCH1 mutations result in constitutive Hedgehog pathway activity through uncontrolled SMO signaling. Targeting this pathway with vismodegib, a novel SMO inhibitor, results in impressive tumor regression in patients harboring genetic defects in this pathway. However, a secondary mutation in SMO has been reported in medulloblastoma patients following relapse on vismodegib to date. This mutation preserves pathway activity, but appears to confer resistance by interfering with drug binding. Here we report for the first time on the molecular mechanisms of resistance to vismodegib in two BCC cases. The first case, showing progression after 2 months of continuous vismodegib (primary resistance), exhibited the new SMO G497W mutation. The second case, showing a complete clinical response after 5 months of treatment and a subsequent progression after 11 months on vismodegib (secondary resistance), exhibited a PTCH1 nonsense mutation in both the pre- and the post-treatment specimens, and the SMO D473Y mutation in the post-treatment specimens only. In silico analysis demonstrated that SMO(G497W) undergoes a conformational rearrangement resulting in a partial obstruction of the protein drug entry site, whereas the SMO D473Y mutation induces a direct effect on the binding site geometry leading to a total disruption of a stabilizing hydrogen bond network. Thus, the G497W and D473Y SMO mutations may represent two different mechanisms leading to primary and secondary resistance to vismodegib, respectively.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Patched1 (PTCH1) is a human tumour suppressor that acts as an HH (Hedgehog) receptor protein and is important for embryonic patterning. PTCH1 mediates its effects through SMO (Smoothened) and represses the expression of HH target genes such as the transcription factor GLI1 (glioma 1) as well as PTCH1. Up-regulation of these genes has been observed in several cancer forms, including basal cell carcinoma, digestive track tumours and small cell lung cancer. The fact that PTCH1 down-regulates its own expression via 'negative feedback' is an important feature in HH signalling, as it keeps the balance between HH and PTCH1 activities that are essential for normal development. In the present study, we provide evidence that a novel mechanism allowing PTCH1 to maintain this balance may also exist. We show that gene activation by GLI1, the transcriptional effector of the pathway, can be down-regulated by PTCH1 without involvement of the canonical cascade of HH signalling events. Specifically, the SMO antagonist cyclopamine has no appreciable effects in blocking this PTCH1-mediated inhibition. Moreover, the negative GLI1 regulator SUFU (Suppressor of Fused) was also found to be dispensable. Additionally, deletion mapping of PTCH1 has revealed that the domains encompassed by amino acids 180-786 and 1058-1210 are of highest significance in inhibiting GLI1 gene activation. This contrasts with the importance of the PTCH1 C-terminal domain for HH signalling.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Dysexpression of microRNAs has been found in many tumors, including lung cancer. The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays an important role during normal development, and the abnormal regulation of its members has also been related to many tumors. However, little is known about the relationship between microRNA and the Hh pathway. In this paper, we report microRNA-212 (miR-212) playing a role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and targeting PTCH1, a receptor of the Hh pathway. We found that miR-212 was up-regulated when cells were treated with 4Ã-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). We ectopically expressed miR-212 in NSCLC cell lines to examine the influence of miR-212 overexpression. The results showed that overexpression of miR-212 in NSCLC cells promoted cell cycle progression and cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The promoting effects of miR-212 on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were partially reversed by the miR-212 inhibitor anti-miR-212. These results suggested that miR-212 might have tumor-promoting properties. Potential targets of miR-212 were predicted, and we showed tumor suppressor PTCH1 was a functional target of miR-212. PTCH1 may be responsible for the effect of miR-212 on cell proliferation. Altogether, our results indicated that miR-212 was involved in tumorigenesis, and the oncogenic activity of miR-212 in NSCLC cells was due, in part, to suppression of PTCH1.",

As the detailed preneoplastic changes of MB remain obscure, we immunohistochemically clarified the derived cell, early events of MBs, and the cerebellar developmental processes of Ptch1(+/-) (Ptch1) mice, an animal model of human MB of the Shh subgroup. In Ptch1 mice, the earliest proliferative lesions were detected at PND10 as focal thickened areas of outer layer of the EGL. This area was composed of GCP-like cells with atypia and nuclei disarrangement. In the latter cerebellar developmental period, GCP-like cell foci were detected at high incidence in the outermost area of the cerebellum. Their localization and morphological similarities indicated that the foci were derived from GCPs in the EGL. There were two types of the foci. A Ki-67-positive focus was found in Ptch1 mice only. This type resembled the GCPs in the outer layer of EGL characterized by having proliferating activity and a lack of neuronal differentiation. Another type of focus, Ki-67-negative, was observed in both genotypes and exhibited many of the same features of mature internal granule cells, suggesting that the focus had no preneoplastic potential. Due to morphological, immunohistochemical characteristics, our results indicate that the focal thickened area of EGL and Ki-67-positive foci are preneoplastic lesions of MB. ",

In the search for other tumor suppressors, interest has focused on the deletion events at the 17p13.3 locus, the most common genetic defect in medulloblastoma. This chromosomal region contains HYPERMETHYLATED IN CANCER 1 (HIC1), a transcriptional repressor that is a frequent target of epigenetic gene silencing in medulloblastoma. Here we use a mouse model of Ptch1 heterozygosity to reveal a critical tumor suppressor function for Hic1 in medulloblastoma. When compared with Ptch1 heterozygous mutants, compound Ptch1/Hic1 heterozygotes display a fourfold increased incidence of medulloblastoma. We show that Hic1 is a direct transcriptional repressor of Atonal Homolog 1 (Atoh1), a proneural transcription factor essential for cerebellar development, and show that ATOH1 expression is required for human medulloblastoma cell growth in vitro. Given that Atoh1 is also a putative target of Hh signaling, we conclude that the Hic1 and Ptch1 tumor suppressors cooperate to silence Atoh1 expression during a critical phase in GCP differentiation in which malignant transformation may lead to medulloblastoma.",

To increase the incidence and reduce the time required for tumor development, allowing for evaluation of modifier effects on medulloblastoma in a short time, we attempted to develop an early induction model of medulloblastoma in ptch1 mice initiated with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). Ptch1 mice and their wild-type littermates received a single intraperitoneal injection of ENU (10, 50 or 100 mg/kg) on postnatal day 1 (d1) or 4 (d4), and histopathological assessment of brains was conducted at 12 weeks of age. The width of the external granular layer (EGL), a possible origin of medulloblastoma, after injection of 100 mg ENU on d1 or d4 was measured in up to 21-day-old mice. Cerebellar size was apparently reduced at the 50 mg dose and higher regardless of genotype. Microscopically, early lesions of medulloblastomas occurred with a high incidence only in ptch1 mice receiving 10 mg on d1 or d4, but a significant increase was not observed in other groups. Persistent EGL cells and misalignment of Purkinje cells were increased dose-dependently. Although EGL was strikingly decreased after ENU injection, strong recovery was observed in mice of the d1-treated group. In summary, neonatal treatment with ENU is available for the induction of medulloblastoma in ptch1 mice, and 10 mg of ENU administered on d1 appeared to be an appropriate dose to induce medulloblastoma.",

Ptch1(+/-) mice are predisposed to developing medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma, while Sufu(+/-) mice develop a skin phenotype characterized by basaloid epidermal proliferations. Here, we have studied tumor development in Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) mice to determine the effect of compound heterozygosity on the onset, incidence, and spectrum of tumors. We found significantly more (2.3-fold) basaloid proliferations in Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) compared to Sufu(+/-) female, but not male, mice. For medulloblastoma, the cumulative 1-yr incidence was 1.5-fold higher in Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) compared to Ptch1(+/-) female mice but this strong trend was not statistically significant. Together this suggests a weak genetic interaction of the two tumor suppressor genes. We noted a few rhabdomyosarcomas and pancreatic cysts in the Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) mice, but the numbers were not significantly different from the single heterozygous mice. Hydrocephalus developed in approximately 20% of the Ptch1(+/-) and Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) but not in Sufu(+/-) mice. Interestingly, most of the medulloblastomas from the Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) mice had lost expression of the remaining Ptch1 wild-type allele but not the Sufu wild-type allele. On the contrary, Sufu as well as Gli1 and Gli2 expression was upregulated in the medulloblastomas compared to adult cerebellum in Ptch1(+/-) and Sufu(+/-)Ptch1(+/-) mice.

The aim of the study was to describe a patient whose Merkel cell carcinoma demonstrated a SUFU genomic alteration.;The Hh signaling pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of several tumors, including nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome that is associated with an alteration of the patched-1 (PTCH1) gene. Targeted molecular therapy against smoothened (SMO) with vismodegib has been shown to be an effective therapeutic intervention for patients with PTCH-1 mutation. The reported patient was presented with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. Analysis of his tumor, using a next-generation sequencing-based assay, demonstrated a genomic aberration of SUFU protein, a component of the Hh signaling pathway that acts downstream to SMO and, therefore, is unlikely to be responsive to vismodegib. Of interest, arsenic trioxide or bromo and extra C-terminal inhibitors impact signals downstream to SUFU, making this aberration conceivably druggable. His tumor has initially been managed with chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide) and subsequent radiation therapy is planned.;The pathogenesis of Merkel cell carcinoma is multifactorial, and related to ultraviolet radiation exposure, immunosuppression, and Merkel cell polyomavirus. We report a patient with a mutation in SUFU, a potentially actionable component of the Hh signaling pathway.",

It is generally considered a sporadic tumour, most likely to affect fair-skinned individuals exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This chapter focusses on the approach to recognising the relatively few individuals in whom a high-risk hereditary susceptibility may be present. Gorlin syndrome is the main consideration and the gene most commonly mutated is PTCH1, a key regulator of the Hedgehog developmental pathway. Recently, loss of function of another gene in the same pathway, SUFU, has been found to explain a subset of families. Understanding the pathogenesis of familial BCCs has advanced the understanding of the biology of sporadic tumours and led to targeted therapy trials. The management of familial BCCs remains a challenge due to significant unmet needs for non-surgical treatments and a high burden of disease for the individual. Together with the prospect of advances in gene discovery and translation, these challenges highlight the need for ongoing review of at-risk and affected individuals by a multidisciplinary team. ",

        "Doc_abstract":"The human PTCH2 gene is highly similar to PTCH1, a tumour suppressor gene frequently mutated in basal cell carcinoma and several other tumour types. PTCH1 is a transmembrane protein believed to inhibit another transmembrane protein SMO (Smoothened), which mediates HH (Hedgehog) signalling. In this study, we analysed the biological properties of several PTCH2 splice variants. An mRNA form that lacked the last exon was abundantly expressed in all tissues examined, in contrast with the one that included it. Moreover, a transcript lacking exon 9, which is a part of a conserved sterol-sensing domain, was identified in intestine, prostate and cerebellum. In ovary, spleen, testis, cerebellum and skin, an mRNA lacking both exons 9 and 10 could also be observed. The different PTCH2 isoforms localized in the cytoplasm were capable of internalizing the N-terminal fragment of Sonic HH (Shh-N). Additionally, the PTCH2 gene was found to be a target of HH signalling. PTCH2 promoter regulation assays demonstrated that only one of the PTCH2 variants could inhibit the activity of SHH-N, whereas none was capable of inhibiting the activated form of SMO (SMO-M2) and this contrasts with PTCH1. Despite the fact that the PTCH2 isoforms lacked the ability to inhibit SMO-M2 activity, all PTCH2 variants as well as PTCH1, on co-transfection with Smo, were able to change Smo localization from being largely dispersed in the cytoplasm to the juxtanuclear region. Furthermore, the PTCH2 isoforms and PTCH1 co-localized in doubly transfected cells and an interaction between them was confirmed using immunoprecipitation assays. Using Ptch1-/- mouse cells, it was shown that the PTCH2 variants and PTCH1 differentially act to reconstitute not only the SHH but also the Desert HH-dependent transcriptional response. We conclude that in spite of their structural similarities, the PTCH2 isoforms have distinct functional properties when compared with PTCH1.",

Patients with basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin syndrome) are highly susceptible to developing many BCCs as a result of a constitutive inactivating mutation in one allele of PATCHED 1, which encodes a tumor suppressor that is a major inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling. Dysregulated Hedgehog signaling is a common feature of both hereditary and sporadic BCCs. Recently, we showed remarkable anti-BCC chemopreventive efficacy of tazarotene, a retinoid with retinoic acid receptor (RAR) beta/gamma specificity, in Ptch1+/- mice when treatment was commenced before carcinogenic insults. In this study, we assessed whether the effect of tazarotene against BCC carcinogenesis is sustained after its withdrawal and whether tazarotene is effective against preexisting microscopic BCC lesions. We found that BCCs did not reappear for at least 5 months after topical drug treatment was stopped and that already developed, microscopic BCCs were susceptible to tazarotene inhibition. In vitro, tazarotene inhibited a murine BCC keratinocyte cell line, ASZ001, suggesting that its effect in vivo is by direct action on the actual tumor cells. Down-regulation of Gli1, a target gene of Hedgehog signaling and up-regulation of CRABPII, a target gene of retinoid signaling, were observed with tazarotene treatment. Finally, we investigated the effects of topical applications of other retinoid-related compounds on BCC tumorigenesis in vivo. Tazarotene was the most effective of the preparations studied, and its effect most likely was mediated by RARgamma activation. Furthermore, inhibition of basal RAR signaling in the skin promoted BCC carcinogenesis, suggesting that endogenous RAR signaling restrains BCC growth.",

Embryonal carcinomas (ECs) represent the stem cell compartment of GCTs and are the malignant counterpart to embryonic stem (ES) cells. GCTs and EC cells are useful to investigate differentiation therapy and chemotherapy response. This study explored mechanistic interactions between all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), which induces differentiation of EC and ES cells, and the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, a regulator of self-renewal and proliferation. RA was found to induce mRNA and protein expression of Patched 1 (Ptch1), the Hh ligand receptor and negative regulator of this pathway. PTCH1 is also a target gene of Hh signaling through Smoothened (Smo) activation. Yet, this observed RA-mediated Ptch1 induction was independent of Smo. It occurred despite co-treatment with RA and Smo inhibitors. Retinoid induction of Ptch1 also occurred in other RA-responsive cancer cell lines and in normal ES cells. Notably, this enhanced Ptch1 expression was preceded by induction of the homeobox transcription factor Meis1, a direct RA target. Direct interaction between Meis1 and Ptch1 was confirmed using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. To establish the translational relevance of this work, Ptch1 expression was shown to be deregulated in human ECs relative to mature teratoma and the normal seminiferous tubule. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism through which RA can inhibit the Hh pathway via Ptch1 induction. Engaging this pathway is a new way to repress the Hh pathway that can be translated into the cancer clinic.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), also known as Gorlin syndrome, is a hereditary condition characterized by a wide range of developmental abnormalities and a predisposition to neoplasms. The estimated prevalence varies from 1/57,000 to 1/256,000, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1. Main clinical manifestations include multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), odontogenic keratocysts of the jaws, hyperkeratosis of palms and soles, skeletal abnormalities, intracranial ectopic calcifications, and facial dysmorphism (macrocephaly, cleft lip/palate and severe eye anomalies). Intellectual deficit is present in up to 5% of cases. BCCs (varying clinically from flesh-colored papules to ulcerating plaques and in diameter from 1 to 10 mm) are most commonly located on the face, back and chest. The number of BBCs varies from a few to several thousand. Recurrent jaw cysts occur in 90% of patients. Skeletal abnormalities (affecting the shape of the ribs, vertebral column bones, and the skull) are frequent. Ocular, genitourinary and cardiovascular disorders may occur. About 5-10% of NBCCS patients develop the brain malignancy medulloblastoma, which may be a potential cause of early death. NBCCS is caused by mutations in the PTCH1 gene and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance and variable expressivity. Clinical diagnosis relies on specific criteria. Gene mutation analysis confirms the diagnosis. Genetic counseling is mandatory. Antenatal diagnosis is feasible by means of ultrasound scans and analysis of DNA extracted from fetal cells (obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling). Main differential diagnoses include Bazex syndrome, trichoepithelioma papulosum multiplex and Torre's syndrome (Muir-Torre's syndrome). Management requires a multidisciplinary approach. Keratocysts are treated by surgical removal. Surgery for BBCs is indicated when the number of lesions is limited; other treatments include laser ablation, photodynamic therapy and topical chemotherapy. Radiotherapy should be avoided. Vitamin A analogs may play a preventive role against development of new BCCs. Life expectancy in NBCCS is not significantly altered but morbidity from complications can be substantial. Regular follow-up by a multi-specialist team (dermatologist, neurologist and odontologist) should be offered. Patients with NBCCS should strictly avoid an excessive sun exposure.",

A subset of 36.7% of 60 tested CLL samples responded to all 3 SMOOTHENED (SMO) inhibitors, whereas 40% were completely resistant. Responsiveness correlated with elevated GLI1 and PTCH1 transcript levels and the presence of trisomy 12, whereas no other karyotype correlated with responsiveness. All trisomy 12 CLLs displayed constitutive HH pathway activation driven by autocrine DESERT HH (DHH) ligand secretion, which could be blocked by the HH-blocking Ab 5E1. Cocultures with DHH-expressing BM stromal cells reduced sensitivity of CLLs to SMO-inhibitor treatment by activation of noncanonical ERK phosphorylation directly downstream of the PTCH1 receptor without involvement of SMO and could be overcome by the HH-blocking Ab 5E1 or a combination of SMO and ERK inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that the HH-signaling pathway is an interesting therapeutic target for a subset of patients with CLL, characterized by high GLI1 and PTCH1 transcript levels, and all patients with trisomy 12 and indicate HH-blocking Abs to be favorable over SMO inhibitors in overcoming stroma-mediated protective effects.",

Here, we investigated endocrine signaling in a murine model of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin, the most common cancer. BCCs were generated by the activation of Hh signaling resulting from the specific deletion of the Ptch1 gene in the developing epidermis. Subsequently, a severe growth deficiency was observed in the murine BCC model, and we identified a deficiency of circulating IGF1 (Igf1). We demonstrate that Hh pathway activation in murine BCC induces IGF binding proteins, thereby regulating Igf1 sequestration into the skin and skewing Igf endocrine signaling. Significantly, these results show that Hh-induced tumors can have endocrine effects on normal tissues that in turn can greatly impact the host.

Here, exploiting Ptch1 heterozygous knockout mice, susceptible to spontaneous and radiation-induced medulloblastoma, we show that exposure of paternal germ cells to 1 Gy X-rays, at the spermatogonial stage, increased by a considerable 1.4-fold the offspring susceptibility to medulloblastoma induced by neonatal irradiation. This effect gained further biological significance thanks to a number of supporting data on the immunohistochemical characterization of the target tissue and preneoplastic lesions (PNLs). These results altogether pointed to increased proliferation of cerebellar granule cell precursors and PNLs cells, which favoured the development of frank tumours. The LOH analysis of tumor DNA showed Ptch1 biallelic loss in all tumor samples, suggesting that mechanisms other than interstitial deletions, typical of radiation-induced medulloblastoma, did not account for the observed increased cancer risk. This data was supported by comet analysis showing no differences in DNA damage induction and repair in cerebellar cells as a function of paternal irradiation. Finally, we provide biological plausibility to our results offering evidence of a possible epigenetic mechanism of inheritance based on radiation-induced changes of the microRNA profile of paternal sperm.

        "Doc_abstract":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a very common head and neck cancer in southern china. Despite advances in surgical and chemotherapeutic approaches, its prognosis is still not promising. Hedgehog signaling pathway was reported to be involved in a number of cancers including head and neck. However, it remains unclear regarding the role of this pathway in NPC. By real-time PCR, we found Ptch1, Smo, and Gli-1 were expressed in all human nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues and cell lines. Compared with nasopharyngeal normal epithelial tissues, the mRNA expression level of Gli-1 was higher in carcinoma and nasopharyngitis (NPI) epithelial tissues. While compared with nasopharyngitis epithelia, the mRNA expression level of Ptch1 was lower in carcinoma epithelia and normal epithelia. The expressions of Smo mRNA were not significantly different among these epithelial tissues. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that the expression level of Gli-1 was higher in NPC than NPI. Thus, our data indicated that aberrant activation of hedgehog pathway in NPC. Furthermore, blocking the pathway with cyclopamine inhibited the proliferation of NPC epithelia cell lines. In addition, blockade of the pathway in three NPC cell lines with cyclopamine-induced tumor cell apoptosis. The transcription of hedgehog target genes also is inhibited by cyclopamine. These data suggested that hedgehog pathway may sustain nasopharyngeal tumor growth. Our data demonstrated that hedgehog signaling pathway was involved in NPC pathogenesis and might be a novel therapeutic target for NPC. ",

In OVCAR 432 cells treatment with sequential combination of 5-FU and BA increased the Sub-G1 cell population to 51.3% and growth inhibition rate of > 72%. However, exposure to BA before 5-FU treatment caused a decrease in rate of inhibition to < 35%. Treatment with combination of 5 Î¼M of 5-FU and 1 Î¼M of BA for 48 h, led to an induction of apoptosis in 79.7% and induced morphological changes in OVCAR 432 cells. The Western blot results showed high concentration of cytochrome c in the cell cytosol after 24 h of 5-FU and BA combination treatment.

Some of the more striking features in the patient's personal history include psychomotor retardation and a family history of suspected GS in the mother as a result of a maxillary cyst. An examination revealed macrocephaly with a prominent forehead and hypertelorism, as well as nevus. A genetic study for GS was requested, in which mutation c.930delC was detected in exon 6 of the PTCH1 gene in heterozygosis.;In GS there is an increase in the likelihood of developing basal cell carcinomas and strict dermatological monitoring is necessary. A clinical neurological follow-up and also magnetic resonance imaging scans are needed for an early diagnosis of intracranial tumours, especially in the case of medulloblastomas. Odontogenic keratocysts, other skin disorders, and cardiac and ovarian fibromas are characteristic, as are skeletal abnormalities, which require regular clinical and neuroimaging controls and treatment if needed, but radiation must be avoided.

Here, we report that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of PTCH1 interacts with and is ubiquitylated on K1413 by the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Itchy homolog (Itch), a Nedd4 family member. Itch induces the ubiquitylation of K1413, the reduction of PTCH1 levels at the plasma membrane, and degradation, activating Gli transcriptional activity in the absence of Hh ligands. Silencing of Itch stabilizes PTCH1 and increases its level of retention at the plasma membrane. Itch is the preferential PTCH1 E3 ligase in the absence of Hh ligands, since of the other seven Nedd4 family members, only WW domain-containing protein 2 (WWP2) showed a minor redundant role. Like Itch depletion, mutation of the ubiquitylation site (K1314R) resulted in the accumulation of PTCH1 at the plasma membrane, prolongation of its half-life, and increased cell death by hyperactivation of caspase-9. Remarkably, Itch is the main determinant of PTCH1 stability under resting conditions but not in response to Sonic Hedgehog. In conclusion, our findings reveal that Itch is a key regulator of ligand-independent Gli activation and noncanonical Hh signaling by the governance of basal PTCH1 internalization and degradation. ",

In this study, we attempted to determine the expression of Bmi-1 stem cell marker and of Shh pathway downstream target genes glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1), protein patched homolog 1 (PTCH1), Cyclin D2, plakoglobin (Î³ catenin), NK2 homeobox 2 (NKX2.2), paired box gene 6 (PAX6), secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), and hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP) in 11 neuroblastoma cell lines and 41 neuroblastoma samples. Also, inhibition of the pathway was performed genetically by GLI1 knockdown siRNA or chemically by cyclopamine. After inhibition, low transcript expression was detected in downstream target genes like PTCH1, in the cell lines.

Ptch1 heterozygous mice mimic the predisposition to BCC and MB development of patients affected by nevoid BCC syndrome that inherit a mutant Patched (Ptch1) allele. To examine the impact of genetic background on development of BCCs and other tumors we used two outbred mouse lines characterized by extremely high, carcinogenesis-susceptible (Car-S), and low, carcinogenesis-resistant (Car-R), susceptibility to skin carcinogenesis. Crosses between Ptch1(neo67/+) mice and Car-S (F1S) or Car-R mice (F1R) were exposed to ionizing radiation. F1SPtch1(neo67/+) mice were highly susceptible to radiation-induced BCCs, whereas F1RPtch1(neo67/+) mice were completely resistant, indicating that tumor penetrance can be modulated by genetic background. Development of microscopic and macroscopic BCC lesions was influenced by Car-S and Car-R genotypes, suggesting a genetic-background effect on both initiation and progression of BCC. Susceptibility was additionally increased in N2 backcross mice (Car-S x F1SPtch1(neo67/+)), showing a contribution from recessive-acting Car-S modifiers. The modifying effects of Car-S-derived susceptibility alleles were tissue specific. In fact, despite higher susceptibility to BCC induction, Car-S-derived lines had lower MB incidence compared with CD1Ptch1(neo67/+) mice. BCC-associated somatic events were not influenced by genetic background, as shown by similar rate of wild-type Ptch1 loss in BCCs from F1SPtch1(neo67/+) (93%) and CD1Ptch1(neo67/+) mice (100%). Finally, microsatellite analysis of BCCs showed Ptch1 loss through interstitial deletion.

It was later shown that Hh signaling is associated with many types of cancer, including skin, leukemia, lung, brain and gastrointestinal cancers. Another important milestone for the Hh research field is the FDA approval for the clinical use of Hh inhibitor Erivedge/Vismodegib for treatment of locally advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinomas. However, recent clinical trials of Hh signaling inhibitors in pancreatic, colon and ovarian cancer all failed, indicating a real need for further understanding of Hh signaling in cancer.

Patched (Ptc) encodes a receptor for Hh ligands and functions as a tumor suppressor. PTCH1 mutations in humans are found in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and irradiated Ptc1(+/-) mice recapitulate this phenotype. However, due to embryonic lethality associated with the Ptc1 null mutation, its normal function in embryonic and adult skin remains unknown. Here we describe the epidermal phenotypes of a spontaneous and viable allele of Ptc1, Ptc1(mes), in which the C-terminal domain (CTD) is truncated. Ptc1(mes/mes) embryos display normal epidermal and hair follicle development. Postnatal Ptc1(mes/mes) skin displays severe basal cell layer hyperplasia and increased proliferation, while stratification of the suprabasal layers is mostly normal. Interestingly, truncation of the Ptc1 CTD did not result in skin tumors. However, long term labeling studies revealed a greater than three-fold increase in label-retaining cells in the interfollicular epidermis of Ptc1(mes/mes) adults, indicating possible expansion of the epidermal stem cell compartment. Increased expression of regulators of epidermal homeostasis, c-Myc and p63, was also observed in Ptc1(mes/mes) adult skin. These results suggest that the CTD of Ptc1 is involved in regulating epidermal homeostasis in mature skin.",

Melanin is a natural skin protective factor against UV radiation. Skin cancers associated with long-term exposure to UV radiation are: basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). The high risk of BCC development is related to acute and repeated exposure to UV causing sunburn. Molecular studies of BBC demonstrated disorders in sonic hedgehog (SHH) cell signaling regulation pathway, associated with the suppressor protein patched homolog 1 gene (PTCH1) mutations. The risk of the BCC development is related to the polymorphism of melanokortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R). Tumor P53 gene mutations observed in BCC cells has been classified as secondary genetic changes. In SCC cells UV-induced mutations were mostly related to P53 gene. Increased expression of cyclooxigenase- 2 gene (COX-2) plays a significant role in the development of SCC. Other pathogenetic factors include intensification of the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±), interleukin-1 Î± (IL-1Î±), IL-1Î² and IL-6). Currently, the role of UVB has been recognized in the pathogenesis of CMM. In CMM cells the following gene mutations were noted: cyclindependent kinase inhibitor 2A INK4A (p16INK4A), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), Ras, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and proto-oncogene B-Raf (BRAF).

We demonstrate here that Hh-binding to Ptch1 stimulates activation of Erk1/2. This activation is insensitive to the small molecule Smo antagonists and occurs in a cell line that does not express Smo. Specifically, the C-terminus of Ptch1 harbours motifs encoding Class I and II SH3-binding sites. SH3-domain binding activity was verified using GST-c-src(SH3), -Grb2(SH3) and -p85beta(SH3) fusion-proteins. Ectopically expressed Grb2 or p85beta could also be co-immunoprecipitated with the Ptch1 C-terminus. Addition of Shh to serum-starved human mammary epithelial cells and Shh Light II fibroblasts stimulated phosphorylation of Erk1/2. Erk1/2 activation was observed in cells where Smo activity had been inhibited using cyclopamine and in the breast epithelial cell line, MCF10A, that does not express Smo.

Evidence for a more direct role of Hh signaling on the growth and evolution of colorectal cancer cell clones has been lacking. Here, we report a loss-of-function mutation of PTCH1, a tumor suppressor in the Hh pathway, in a colorectal cancer that exhibits transcriptional upregulation of the downstream Hh gene GLI1.

Binding of Shh to Ptc1 results in activation of Smoothened (Smo), which in turn stimulates expression of downstream target genes including Ptc1 and Gli1. Gli1 is a member of a family of DNA-binding zinc-finger proteins, including Gli2 and Gli3, that function in transcription control. Here, we report that inactivation of both Gli1 alleles in Ptc1+/- mice significantly reduces spontaneous medulloblastoma formation. Therefore, Gli1 is not only a marker of pathway activation but also plays a functional role in medulloblastoma formation. Interestingly, Gli2 levels were elevated in medulloblastoma cells but not in normal granule neuron precursors during cerebellar development in mice lacking Gli1. In cultured fibroblasts, Gli1 was more potent than Gli2 at inducing cell transformation.

Here, we provide evidence to indicate that hedgehog signaling activation occurs frequently in HCC. We detect expression of Shh, PTCH1 and Gli1 in 115 cases of HCC and in 44 liver tissues adjacent to the tumor. Expression of Shh is detectable in about 60% of HCCs examined. Consistent with this, hedgehog target genes PTCH1 and Gli1 are expressed in over 50% of the tumors, suggesting that the hedgehog pathway is frequently activated in HCCs. Of five cell lines screened, we found Hep3B, Huh7 and PLC/PRF/5 cells with detectable hedgehog target genes. Specific inhibition of hedgehog signaling in these three cell lines by smoothened (SMO) antagonist, KAAD-cyclopamine, or with Shh neutralizing antibodies decreases expression of hedgehog target genes, inhibits cell growth and results in apoptosis. In contrast, no effects are observed after these treatments in HCC36 and HepG2 cells, which do not have detectable hedgehog signaling.

However, the biallelic Pro1315Leu (C3944T) polymorphism of PTCH1 was significantly associated with breast cancer in 41 Bavarian patients compared to 85 healthy controls. We investigated whether this variant influences susceptibility for breast cancer in 611 breast cancer patients diagnosed by age 50 years and 1,057 controls matched by age and study region in Germany and in 1,093 breast cancer patients from the United Kingdom. Allele and genotype frequencies were not different between cases and controls. However, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed an effect modification of oral contraceptive use (OC) on breast cancer risk by Leu-carrier status. Compared to women who have Pro/Pro and never used OC, Pro/Pro OC users had an increased odds ratio for breast cancer of 1.7. The odds ratio was also 1.7 for Leu-carriers who never used OC, but this was attenuated among Leu-carriers who ever used OC by 20%. The gene-environmental interaction was confirmed in case-only analysis of the German and British studies, yielding an interaction odds ratio of 0.7 for premenopausal women (p = 0.06). Longer duration of pill use was associated with a significantly greater risk reduction (p for trend = 0.015).

Transcriptome analysis has identified four major medulloblastoma subgroups. One of them, the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) subgroup, is caused by aberrant Hedgehog signal transduction due to mutations in the Patched1 (PTCH1) receptor or downstream effectors. Mice carrying a Patched-1 null allele (Ptch1â/+) are a good model to study the alterations underlying medulloblastoma development as a consequence of aberrant Hedgehog pathway activity.;Transcriptome analysis of human medulloblastomas shows that SERPINE2, also called Protease Nexin-1 (PN-1) is overexpressed in most medulloblastomas, in particular in the SHH and WNT subgroups. As siRNA-mediated lowering of SERPINE2/PN-1 in human medulloblastoma DAOY cells reduces cell proliferation, we analyzed its potential involvement in medulloblastoma development using the Ptch1â/+ mouse model. In Ptch1â/+ mice, medulloblastomas arise as a consequence of aberrant Hedgehog pathway activity. Genetic reduction of Serpine2/Pn-1 interferes with medulloblastoma development in Ptch1â/+ mice, as ~60% of the pre-neoplastic lesions (PNLs) fail to develop into medulloblastomas and remain as small cerebellar nodules. In particular the transcription factor Atoh1, whose expression is essential for development of SHH subgroup medulloblastomas is lost. Comparative molecular analysis reveals the distinct nature of the PNLs in young Ptch1â/+Pn-1Î/+ mice. The remaining wild-type Ptch1 allele escapes transcriptional silencing in most cases and the aberrant Hedgehog pathway activity is normalized. Furthermore, cell proliferation and the expression of the cell-cycle regulators Mycn and Cdk6 are significantly reduced in PNLs of Ptch1â/+Pn-1Î/+ mice.;Our analysis provides genetic evidence that aberrant Serpine2/Pn-1 is required for proliferation of human and mouse medulloblastoma cells.

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and northern blot analyses showed that whole ovarian Ihh and Dhh transcripts decreased 4-24 h after hCG versus 0-48 h after pregnant mares serum gonadotrophin treatment in mice, whereas mouse Ptch1 and Smo transcripts were expressed throughout the gonadotropin treatments. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that the expression of the Hh-patched signaling system with Ihh mRNA abundance in granulosa cells was greater, whereas Smo and Ptch1 mRNA abundance was less in theca cells of small versus large follicles of cattle. In cultured rat and bovine theca-interstitial cells, qRT-PCR analyses revealed that the abundance of Gli1 and Ptch1 mRNAs were increased (P<0.05) with sonic hedgehog (SHH) treatment. Additional studies using cultured bovine theca cells indicated that SHH induces proliferation and androstenedione production. IGF1 decreased Ihh mRNA abundance in bovine granulosa cells. The expression and regulation of Ihh transcripts in granulosa cells and Ptch1 mRNA in theca cells suggest a potential paracrine role of this system in bovine follicular development.

Here, we report endocytic sorting signals for the receptor Patched1 (Ptch1), comprising two 'PPXY' motifs, that direct it to degradation in lysosomes. These signals are recognized by two HECT-domain ubiquitin E3 ligases, Smurf1 and Smurf2, which are induced by Shh and become enriched in Caveolin-1 lipid rafts in association with Ptch1. Smurf-mediated endocytic turnover of Ptch1 is essential for its clearance from the primary cilium and pathway activation. Removal of both Smurfs completely abolishes the ability of Shh to sustain the proliferation of postnatal granule cell precursors in the cerebellum. These findings reveal a novel step in the Shh pathway activation as part of the Ptch1 negative feedback loop that precisely controls the signaling output in response to Shh gradient signal. ",

The mechanism behind Ptch1-dependent Smo inhibition remains unresolved. We now show that by mixing Ptch1-transfected and Ptch1 small interfering RNA-transfected cells with Gli reporter cells, Ptch1 is capable of non-cell autonomous repression of Smo. The magnitude of this non-cell autonomous repression of Smo activity was comparable to the fusion of Ptch1-transfected cell lines and Gli reporter cell lines, suggesting that it is the predominant mode of action. CHOD-PAP analysis of medium conditioned by Ptch1-transfected cells showed an elevated 3beta-hydroxysteroid content, which we hypothesized to mediate the Smo inhibition. Indeed, the inhibition of 3beta-hydroxysteroid synthesis impaired Ptch1 action on Smo, whereas adding the 3beta-hydroxysteroid (pro-)vitamin D3 to the medium effectively inhibited Gli activity. Vitamin D3 bound to Smo with high affinity in a cyclopamine-sensitive manner. Treating zebrafish embryos with vitamin D3 mimicked the smo(-/-) phenotype, confirming the inhibitory action in vivo. Hh activates its signalling cascade by inhibiting Ptch1-dependent secretion of the 3beta-hydroxysteroid (pro-)vitamin D3. This action not only explains the seemingly contradictory cause of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), but also establishes Hh as a unique morphogen, because binding of Hh on one cell is capable of activating Hh-dependent signalling cascades on other cells.",

However, the role of Hh signaling in pediatric liver tumors remains to be elucidated. In this study, we show that Hh signaling is activated in hepatoblastoma (HB), the most common liver tumor in childhood, with most occurrences before the age of 3 years. The Hh target genes glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) and Patched (PTCH1) showed increased transcript levels in 65% and 30% of HB samples, respectively, compared with normal liver tissues. Most interestingly, the gene encoding the hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP) is transcriptionally silenced by cytosine-phospho-guanosine (CpG) island promoter hypermethylation in 26% of HB cases and treatment with the DNA-demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine partially restored HHIP expression. Blocking Hh signaling with the antagonist cyclopamine had a strong inhibitory effect on cell proliferation of HB cell lines with an activated pathway. We further demonstrate that this decrease in cell viability is caused by a massive induction of apoptosis, as shown by morphological changes and phosphatidylserine membrane asymmetry. In cyclopamine-exposed HB cells, caspase 3 and poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase proteins were specifically activated by their proteolytic cleavage.;This study demonstrates, for the first time, the frequent occurrence of GLI1 and PTCH1 overexpression and HHIP promoter methylation in early childhood HB, thus indicating a key role for Hh signaling activation in the malignant transformation of embryonal liver cells.",

Activation of GLIs must be tightly regulated as they modulate target genes which control tissue patterning, stem cell maintenance, and differentiation during development. However, dysregulation or mutations in HH signaling leads to genomic instability (GI) and various cancers, for example, germline mutation in PTCH1 lead to Gorlin syndrome, a condition where patients develop numerous basal cell carcinomas and rarely rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Activating mutations in SMO have also been recognized in sporadic cases of medulloblastoma and SMO is overexpressed in many other cancers. Recently, studies in several human cancers have shown that GLI1 expression is independent from HH ligand and canonical intracellular signaling through PTCH and SMO. In fact, this aberrantly regulated GLI1 has been linked to several non-canonical oncogenic growth signals such as Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), avian myelocytomatosis virus oncogene cellular homolog (C-MYC), transforming growth factor Î² (TGFÎ²), wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) and Î²-catenin. Recent studies from our lab and other independent studies demonstrate that aberrantly expressed GLI1 influences the integrity of several DNA damage response and repair signals, and if altered, these networks can contribute to GI and impact tumor response to chemo- and radiation therapies. Furthermore, the ineffectiveness of SMO inhibitors in clinical studies argues for the development of GLI1-specific inhibitors in order to develop effective therapeutic modalities to treat these tumors. In this review, we focus on summarizing current understanding of the molecular, biochemical and cellular basis for aberrant GLI1 expression and discuss GLI1-mediated HH signaling on DNA damage responses, carcinogenesis and chemoresistance.

In the presence of IFNalpha, we observed increased apoptosis in a BCC cell line ASZ001, in which PTC is null, and therefore with constitutive activation of the sonic hedgehog pathway. We demonstrate that SMO agonist Ag-1.4 mediates activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) phosphorylation, which is abrogated by IFNalpha in sonic hedgehog responsive C3H10T1/2 cells. In transient transfection experiments, we demonstrate that IFNalpha inhibits Erk phosphorylation and serum response element activation induced by expression of SMO, Gli1, PDGFRalpha and activated Raf, but not activated mitogen-activated Erk-regulating kinase (Mek), suggesting that IFNalpha targets mainly on Mek function. We further show that IFNalpha induces expression of Fas in BCC cells through interfering with Mek function. The role of the Fas-L/Fas signaling axis in IFNalpha-mediated apoptosis is demonstrated by the fact that addition of Fas-L neutralizing antibodies, just as caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK, effectively prevents IFNalpha-mediated apoptosis.

We demonstrate here that expression of constitutively active c-src (c-src(Act)) in mammary epithelial cells overcomes the block to mammary epithelial morphogenesis in mes mice. Specifically, MMTV-directed expression of c-src(Act) rescued blocked ductal morphogenesis in mes mice, albeit only after animals were more than 15 weeks of age. The overall morphology resembled wild type mice expressing c-src(Act) although 40% of mes/MMTV-c-src(Act) mice exhibited terminal end buds at 24 weeks of age.

However, cyclopamine reduced viability of cancer epithelial cell lines, including MDA-MB-435, but did not specifically affect fibroblasts or epithelial cells from benign breast, including MCF10AT. Treatment with sonic hedgehog ligand diminished the cyclopamine-induced reduction in GLI-dependent promoter activity in MCF10AT and MDA-MB-435 and viability of MDA-MB-435. These results demonstrate modulation of GLI-mediated transcription in both cancer and benign-derived epithelial cells by cyclopamine and sonic hedgehog, and further suggest that hedgehog signaling contributes to the survival of only the cancer epithelial cells. Determination as to whether the increase in GLI1 and SHH expression in breast cancer indicates a significant increase in hedgehog signaling will require further evaluation.",

While the sonic hedgehog (Shh) transcript is localized to the tumor tissue, expression of Gli1 and PTCH1 is observed both in the tumor and in the stroma. We discovered that 4 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, which overexpress Shh, have genomic amplification of the Shh gene. Treatment of esophageal cancer cells with smoothened antagonist, KAAD-cyclopamine, or the neutralizing antibodies of Shh reduces cell growth and induces apoptosis. Overexpression of Gli1 under the CMV promoter renders these cells resistant to the treatments. Thus, our results indicate that elevated expression of Shh and its target genes is quite common in esophageal cancers.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition can be promoted by the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. Patched1 (PTCH1), a negative regulatory factor of the Hh signalling pathway, was down-regulated during liver fibrosis and associated with its hypermethylation status. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are reported to play a critical role in the control of various HSCs functions. However, miRNA-mediated epigenetic regulations in EMT during liver fibrosis are seldom studied. In this study, Salvianolic acid B (Sal B) suppressed the activation of HSCs in CCl4 -treated mice and mouse primary HSCs, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation, type I collagen and alpha-smooth muscle actin. We demonstrated that the antifibrotic effects caused by Sal B were, at least in part, via inhibition of EMT and the Hh pathway. In particular, up-regulation of PTCH1 was associated with decreased DNA methylation level after Sal B treatment. Accordingly, DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) was attenuated by Sal B in vivo and in vitro. The knockdown of DNMT1 in Sal B-treated HSCs enhanced PTCH1 expression and its demethylation level. Interestingly, increased miR-152 in Sal B-treated cells was responsible for the hypomethylation of PTCH1 by Sal B. As confirmed by the luciferase activity assay, DNMT1 was a direct target of miR-152. Further studies showed that the miR-152 inhibitor reversed Sal B-mediated PTCH1 up-regulation and DNMT1 down-regulation. Collectively, miR-152 induced by Sal B, contributed to DNMT1 down-regulation and epigenetically regulated PTCH1, resulting in the inhibition of EMT in liver fibrosis.",

Although significant progresses have been made on the understanding of individual signaling components of this pathway, the transcriptional regulation of these components is not as well understood. We have recently characterized a novel KrÃ¼ppel-associated box (KRAB) domain containing zinc finger transcription factor ZFP932 (formerly known as ZNF431) and showed that it transcriptionally regulates several components of the Hh pathway. ZFP932 is part of the largest KRAB-domain zinc finger transcription factor family in the mammalian genome. However, the in vivo functions for the majority of these transcription factors as well as their downstream targets are not fully understood. ZFP932 is a nuclear KRAB-domain zinc finger transcriptional repressor that recruits HDACs to target promoters. Using the embryonic limb mesenchymal cell line MPLB, we uncovered many potential targets for ZFP932. Among them, Patched1 (Ptch1) was found to be a direct transcriptional target of ZFP932. Promoter analyses using reporter assays as well as electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed three ZFP932 binding sites in the Ptch1 proximal promoter which are bound by ZFP932 in vivo as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Consistently, overexpression of ZFP932 either in MPLB cells or in Xenopus and mouse embryos strongly repressed Ptch1 expression. Conversely, shRNA knockdown of Zfp932 in MPLB cells elevated Ptch1 expression. In addition to regulating Ptch1 transcription, we demonstrated that ZFP932 also regulates hedgehog signaling as Hh pathway readouts are reduced in ZFP932 overexpression and elevated in ZFP932 knockdown MPLB cells. Moreover, perturbation of ZFP932 expression in C3H10T1/2 cells affected Hh-induced osteoblast differentiation. Together, these results implicate ZFP932 in Hh signaling by transcriptionally regulating Hh signal component expression.",

Response to the Hh ligands is mediated by the receptor Patched-1 (Ptch1), a 12-pass transmembrane glycoprotein. Despite its essential role in Hh signaling and its activity as a tumor suppressor, Ptch1 remains largely uncharacterized. We demonstrate here that Ptch1 binds to itself to form oligomeric structures. Oligomerization is mediated by two distinct, structurally disordered, intracellular domains spanning amino acids 584-734 (\"middle loop\") and 1162-1432 (C terminus). However, oligomerization is not required for Ptch1-dependent regulation of the canonical Hh pathway operating through Smo. Expression of a mutant protein that deletes both regions represses the Hh pathway and responds to the addition of Hh ligand independent of its inability to bind other factors such as Smurf2. Additionally, deletion of the cytoplasmic middle loop domain generates a Ptch1 mutant that, despite binding to Hh ligand, constitutively suppresses Hh signaling and increases the length of primary cilia. Constitutive activity because of deletion of this region is reversed by further deletion of specific sequences in the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. These data reveal an interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of Ptch1 and that these domains modulate Ptch1 activity but are not essential for regulation of the Hh pathway. ",

Bufalin could downregulate the downstream target molecules of MMP-2, MMP-9, Î²-catenin and VEGF in liver cancer cells by influencing the Gli1 and Gli3 expression of Hh signaling pathway, and upregulate the E-cadherin expression of liver cancer cells by influencing the Gli3 expression of Hh signaling pathway.

Paradoxically, mes suppresses canonical Hh signaling and binds to Hh ligands with an affinity similar to wild-type mouse Ptch1 (mPtch1). We characterized the distinct activities of the mes variant of mPtch1 mediating Hh signaling through both canonical and non-canonical pathways. We demonstrated that mPtch1 bound c-src in an Hh-regulated manner. Stimulation with Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) of primary mammary mesenchymal cells from wild-type and mes animals activated Erk1/2. Although Shh activated c-src in wild-type cells, c-src was constitutively activated in mes mesenchymal cells. Transient assays showed that wild-type mPtch1, mes, or mPtch1 lacking the C terminus repressed Hh signaling in Ptch1-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts and that repression was reversed by Shh, revealing that the C terminus was dispensable for mPtch1-dependent regulation of canonical Hh signaling.

Interplay of several signaling cascades, such as Notch, Wnt, and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathways, control cell proliferation during neuronal differentiation. However, it remains unclear whether the Hippo pathway coordinates with other signaling cascades in regulating neuronal differentiation. Here, we used P19 cells, a mouse embryonic carcinoma cell line, as a model to study roles of YAP, a core component of the Hippo pathway, in neuronal differentiation. P19 cells can be induced to differentiate into neurons by expressing a neural bHLH transcription factor gene Ascl1. Our results showed that YAP promoted cell proliferation and inhibited neuronal differentiation. Expression of Yap activated Shh but not Wnt or Notch signaling activity during neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, expression of Yap increased the expression of Patched homolog 1 (Ptch1), a downstream target of the Shh signaling. Knockdown of Gli2, a transcription factor of the Shh pathway, promoted neuronal differentiation even when Yap was over-expressed. We further demonstrated that over-expression of Yap inhibited neuronal differentiation in primary mouse cortical progenitors and Gli2 knockdown rescued the differentiation defect in Yap over-expressing cells.

Two biological events culminating from photodamage are mutations in the genes critical to the control of cell division, differentiation and invasion and immunosuppression. DNA photodamage, if unrepaired prior to cell division, can result in the incorporation of an incorrect nucleotide into newly synthesised DNA. Mutations in critical genes contribute to carcinogenesis. Photodamage to proteins such as those involved in DNA repair or proteins or lipids involved in cellular signalling can interfere with this repair process and contribute to mutagenesis. Mutations in key genes, including TP53, BRM, PTCH1, and HRAS, contribute to skin carcinogenesis. UV also damages immunity. Photodamage to DNA and signalling lipids as well as other molecular changes are detrimental to the key cells that regulate immunity. Photodamaged dendritic cells and altered responses by mast cells lead to the activation of T and B regulatory cells that suppress immunity to the protein products of UV-mutated genes. This stops the immune response from its protective function of destroying mutated cells, enabling the transformed cells to progress to skin cancer. UV appears to play a pivotal role at each of these steps, and therefore, signs of photodamage point to the development of skin cancer.",

Together, these cancers represent over 1.5 million cases and are the cause of about 1.25 million deaths annually. This group of cancers encompasses diseases with marked disparities in etiology, geographic distribution, histopathological features and frequency. Based on histological origin, squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (ESCC), which arises through a dysplasia-carcinoma sequence within the squamous mucosa, is a completely different cancer than junction, stomach and duodenal cancers, which develop within glandular epithelia through cascades involving inflammation, metaplasia, dysplasia and carcinoma. At the frontline between these two histological domains, cancers of the esophago-gastric junction constitute a mixed group of glandular tumors including distal esophageal adenocarcinomas and cancers arising within the most proximal part of the stomach - the cardia. Most of UGIT cancers are sporadic, although familial susceptibility genes have been identified for stomach and rare cases of ESCC. We have used the COSMIC database (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/) to identify genes commonly mutated in UGIT cancers. Regardless of etiology and histopathology, three genes are mutated in at least 5% of UGIT cancers: TP53, CDKN2a and PIK3CA. Another three genes, NFE2L2, PTCH1 and NOTCH1, are mutated in ESCC only. Conversely, genes of the RAS family and of the CDH1/APC/CTNNB1 pathway are mutated only in non-squamous cancers, with differences in mutated genes according to topography. We review the potential functional significance of these observations for understanding mechanisms of UGIT carcinogenesis. ",

High-level expression of PTCH1 and Gli1 was detected in both NB samples and S-type NB cell lines.

The Hh pathway was overexpressed in cancer tissues compared with non-cancer tissues and correlated closely with histologic differentiation and portal venous invasion of HCC. To elucidate the relationship between Hh signaling and HCC progression, we performed a further study in vitro. First, the expression levels of the signaling were detected in a subset of hepatoma cell lines and SMMC-7721 cells selected with high level of Hh signaling expression. Next, we employed KAAD-cyclopamine (a specific inhibitor of Hedgehog pathway) to block the Hh pathway in SMMC-7721 cells and assessed the changes of their biological behaviors. The results showed that the blockade of Hh signaling pathway by KAAD-cyclopamine induced reduction of DNA synthesis leading to marked cell growth inhibition and also caused significant attenuation in invasiveness and motility of HCC cells.

There are approximately 15 cases diagnosed in the Czech Republic each year. The recent World Health Organization classification recognizes several histopathological subtypes of medulloblastoma: classical, desmoplastic/ânodular with its extensive-nodularity variant, and anaplastic/âlarge-cell variant. Further molecular analysis identified four basic subgroups of medulloblastoma: WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4. The subgroup of SHH meduloblastoma is associated with somatic mutations of SHH, PTCH1, SUFU, SMO and TP53, while the most common mutations found in infants up to three years of age were PTCH1 and SUFU. The majority of medulloblastomas are sporadic diseases, whereas only about 5-â10% of all cases occur in connection with hereditary genetic syndromes.;We present a case of a 21-months old girl diagnosed with a localized posterior fossa tumor. The histopathological examination revealed a desmoplastic/ânodular medulloblastoma. The treatment comprised a radical exstirpation of the tumor followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. With the use of array-CGH, a partial biallelic deletion of the SUFU gene (locus 10q24.32) was detected in the tumor DNA, whereas a monoallelic deletion was found in the peripheral lymphocyte DNA of the patient. These findings were confirmed by an independent qPCR method. Monoallelic germline deletion of SUFU was also identified in the patients mother, who was a healthy carrier. Pedigree of the family suggested a transition of the germline deletion of SUFU, since another brain tumors (including one case diagnosed before the age of three years) were identified in previous generations.;Germline mutations in SUFU gene are believed to predispose to infant desmoplastic/ânodular medulloblastomas, basal cell carcinomas and meningiomas. The susceptibility gene shows autosomal dominant inheritance with an incomplete penetrance. There is no evidence-based surveillance strategy suggested for the carriers of germline SUFU mutations/âdeletions so far. Our recommendation is based both on a family history of our patient and similar cases described in the literature. Since the germinal mutations in SUFU are responsible for up to 50% of all desmoplastic medulloblastomas in children under three years of age, genetic testing of SUFU should be encouraged in this population of patients.",

Activation of the hedgehog pathway is associated with poorly differentiated and more aggressive tumors. The sonic hedgehog (Shh) transcript is localized to the cancer tissue, whereas expression of Gli1 and PTCH1 is observed both in the cancer and in the surrounding stroma. Treatment of gastric cancer cells with KAAD-cyclopamine, a hedgehog signaling inhibitor, decreases expression of Gli1 and PTCH1, resulting in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. Overexpression of Gli1 under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter renders these cells resistant to cyclopamine-induced apoptosis. Thus, our analysis of in vivo tissues indicates that the hedgehog pathway is frequently activated in advanced gastric adenocarcinomas; our in vitro studies suggest that hedgehog signaling contributes to gastric cancer cell growth.

Depending on the challenge and the context, constitutively expressed COX-1 or the transiently induced COX-2 isoform are of relevance. Moreover, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of skin is a prominent example of epithelial neoplasia that consistently overexpresses COX-2 in the parenchyme and the mesenchyme of premalignant and malignant lesions, while COX-1 expression remains unaltered. Pharmacological, clinical, and experimental animal studies as well as a few epidemiological studies document the importance of PG signaling in non-melanoma skin cancer including SCC and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in humans and mice. Increased levels of PGE(2) and PGF(2Î±) in premalignant and/or malignant epithelial skin cancers are due to the constitutive upregulation of enzymes involved in PG biosynthesis, such as COX-2, and downregulation of the tumor suppressor gene 15-hydroxy-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), which is involved in the inactivation of PG, thus counteracting the activities of COX. Most remarkably, genetic studies show that mice which are deficient in COX-2 or COX-1 are protected from the development of SCC when applying the multi-stage chemical carcinogenesis protocol. Conversely, the forced overexpression of COX-2 in the proliferative basal compartment of the stratified skin epidermis results in spontaneous hyperplasia and dysplasia in transgenic mice and furthermore a sensitization for cancer development by conferring an auto-promoted skin phenotype. In multi-stage carcinogenesis, it also becomes clear that aberrant COX-2 overexpression and activity are causally involved in tumor promotion and tumor progression rather than initiation. In contrast, using as inducer of carcinogenesis the complete carcinogen UV B light, depletion of COX-2 but not of COX-1 makes mouse skin resistant for SCC, indicating that here, only COX-2 is essential. Depending on the type of challenge, COX-2-dependent signaling contributes to the pre-invasive growth of the skin epidermis by a delayed onset of terminal differentiation, or stimulation of hyperproliferation and survival. With respect to BCC, the genetic ablation of COX-2 but also of COX-1 leads to a strongly reduced tumor burden in the skin of Patched (Ptch)1(+/-) mice, which due to the deletion of a Ptch1 allele, spontaneously develop BCC resembling human familial basal cell nevus syndrome and sporadic BCC. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and the COX-2-selective inhibitors (COXibs) exhibit impressive efficacy inhibiting tumor burden in various mouse models of SCC and BCC. Most importantly, in humans the interruption of COX-2 signaling is an effective strategy to treat and chemo-prevent non-melanoma skin cancer in individuals who are at high risk for the disease. However, any potential beneficial effect of this medicine has to be balanced against the adverse effects that are known to be associated with these drugs in a subset of patients.",

Here, we show that BOC is upregulated in medulloblastomas and induces GCP proliferation. Conversely, Boc inactivation reduces proliferation and progression of early medulloblastomas to advanced tumors. Mechanistically, we find that Boc, through elevated Shh signaling, promotes high levels of DNA damage, an effect mediated by CyclinD1. High DNA damage in the presence of Boc increases the incidence of Ptch1 loss of heterozygosity, an important event in the progression from early to advanced medulloblastoma.

Further studies showed that PVT1 knockdown suppressed HSC activation was through inhibiting EMT process and Hh pathway. Patched1 (PTCH1), a negative regulator factor of Hh pathway, was enhanced by PVT1 knockdown. PTCH1 demethylation caused by miR-152 was responsible for the effects of PVT1 knockdown on PTCH1 expression. Notably, miR-152 inhibitor reversed the effects of PVT1 knockdown on HSC activation. Luciferase reporter assays and pull-down assays showed a direct interaction between miR-152 and PVT1. Collectively, we demonstrate that PVT1 epigenetically down-regulates PTCH1 expression via competitively binding miR-152, contributing to EMT process in liver fibrosis.",

In addition, activation of the pathway in somatic cells contributes to cancer development in several tissues. Suppressor of fused is a negative regulator of Hh signaling. Targeted disruption of the murine suppressor of fused gene (Sufu) led to a phenotype that included neural tube defects and lethality at mid-gestation (9.0-10.5 dpc). This phenotype resembled that caused by loss of patched (Ptch1), another negative regulator of the Hh pathway. Consistent with this finding, Ptch1 and Sufu mutants displayed excess Hh signaling and resultant altered dorsoventral patterning of the neural tube. Sufu mutants also had abnormal cardiac looping, indicating a defect in the determination of left-right asymmetry. Marked expansion of nodal expression in 7.5 dpc embryos and variable degrees of node dysmorphology in 7.75 dpc embryos suggested that the pathogenesis of the cardiac developmental abnormalities was related to node development. Other mutants of the Hh pathway, such as Shh, Smo and Shh/Ihh compound mutants, also have laterality defects. In contrast to Ptch1 heterozygous mice, Sufu heterozygotes had no developmental defects and no apparent tumor predisposition. The resemblance of Sufu homozygotes to Ptch1 homozygotes is consistent with mouse Sufu being a conserved negative modulator of Hh signaling.",

Nevertheless, how these signaling molecules may interact to mediate gut colonization by ENCCs and contribute to a primary etiology for HSCR are not known. Here, we report our pathway-based epistasis analysis of data generated by a genome-wide association study on HSCR disease, which indicates that specific genotype constellations of Patched (PTCH1) (which encodes a receptor for Hedgehog) and delta-like 3 (DLL3) (which encodes a receptor for Notch) SNPs confer higher risk to HSCR. Importantly, deletion of Ptch1 in mouse ENCCs induced robust Dll1 expression and activation of the Notch pathway, leading to premature gliogenesis and reduction of ENCC progenitors in mutant bowels. Dll1 integrated Hedgehog and Notch pathways to coordinate neuronal and glial cell differentiation during enteric nervous system development. In addition, Hedgehog-mediated gliogenesis was found to be highly conserved, such that Hedgehog was consistently able to promote gliogenesis of human neural crest-related precursors. Collectively, we defined PTCH1 and DLL3 as HSCR susceptibility genes and suggest that Hedgehog/Notch-induced premature gliogenesis may represent a new disease mechanism for HSCR.",

Fem1a is a homolog of fem-1, which controls cell fate decisions in the sex determination pathway of Caenorhabditis elegans, a pathway with homology to mammalian hedgehog signaling. We show that Fem1a expression is activated during myocyte differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, and this expression is largely confined to the terminally differentiating pool, not to the satellite-cell-like quiescent reserve cell pool. We find that the human homolog, FEM1A, is downregulated in all of 8 different human RMS cell lines, including those derived from embryonal and alveolar RMS. Using mouse genetic models of RMS development, we further show that Fem1a is consistently downregulated in primary RMS from Ptch1+/- mice, from p53-/- mice, from p53+/-; Ptch1+/- mice, and from HGF/SF-Ink4a/Arf-/- mice.

        "Doc_abstract":"Exposition of the skin with solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) is the main cause of skin cancer development. The consistently increasing incidences of melanocytic and nonmelanocytic skin tumors are believed to be at least in part associated with recreational sun exposure. Epidemiological data indicate that excessive or cumulative sunlight exposition takes place years and decades before the resulting malignancies arise. The most important defense mechanisms that protect human skin against UV radiation involve melanin synthesis and active repair mechanisms. DNA is the major target of direct or indirect UV-induced cellular damage. Low pigmentation capacity in white Caucasians and rare congenital defects in DNA repair are mainly responsible for protection failures. The important function of nucleotide excision DNA repair (NER) to protect against skin cancer becomes obvious by the rare genetic disease xeroderma pigmentosum, in which diverse NER genes are mutated. In animal models, it has been demonstrated that UVB is more effective to induce skin cancer than UVA. UV-induced DNA photoproducts are able to cause specific mutations (UV-signature) in susceptible genes for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). In SCC development, UV-signature mutations in the p513 tumor suppressor gene are the most common event, as precancerous lesions reveal approximately 80% and SCCs > 90% UV-specific p53 mutations. Mutations in Hedgehog pathway related genes, especially PTCH1, are well known to represent the most significant pathogenic event in BCC. However, specific UV-induced mutations can be found only in approximately 50% of sporadic BCCs. Thus, cumulative UVB radiation can not be considered to be the single etiologic risk factor for BCC development. During the last decades, experimental animal models, including genetically engineered mice, the Xiphophorus hybrid fish, the south american oppossum and human skin xenografts, have further elucidated the important role of the DNA repair system in the multi-step process of UV-induced melanomagenesis. An increasing body of evidence now indicates that nucleotide excision repair is not the only DNA repair pathway that is involved in UV-induced tumorigenesis of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. An interesting new perspective in DNA damage and repair research lies in the participation of mammalian mismatch repair (MMR) in UV damage correction. As MMR enzyme hMSH2 displays a p53 target gene, is induced by UVB radiation and is involved in NER pathways, studies have now been initiated to elucidate the physiological and pathophysiological role of MMR in malignant melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer development.",

This highlight focuses on three recently published articles on the mechanism of resistance and possible therapeutic intervention, including RNA treatment with stem cells. We showed a crucial role of the developmental Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway in the acquisition and maintenance of TMZ resistance. SHH signaling caused TMZ resistance in GBM cells through an increase in the multiple drug resistance gene (MDR1). The SHH receptor, Patched-1 (PTCH1), negatively regulate SHH signaling. In GBM, miR-9 suppressed PTCH1 levels, resulting in the activation of SHH pathway. Thus, SHH signaling is independent of the ligand in resistant GBM cells. MiR-9 was also increased in chemoresistance CD133+ GBM cells. A potential method to reverse resistance was tested by delivering the anti-miR in bone marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs). The anti-miR-9 was transferred into the resistant GBM cells through exosomes and gap junctional intercellular communication. We also review on-going clinical trials with inhibitor of SHH signaling, and also discuss drug delivery by cell therapy for GBM.

Chemical and mechanical signaling has been implicated in the maintenance of pluripotency of hiPSCs, as well as their differentiation pathways toward various lineages. Primary cilia have been shown to play a critical role in mechanochemical signaling across a wide spectrum of cell types. The functions of primary cilia in hiPSCs and their characteristic changes during the reprogramming process remain largely vague. This work focused on understanding how reprogramming affects the mechanical characteristics of primary cilia. Using immunofluorescence imaging assays, we validated the presence of primary cilia on reprogrammed cells. These reprogrammed cells had high expression levels of pluripotency markers, Nanog and Cripto, shown by quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. We also found high expression of hedgehog signaling proteins Patched1 (Ptch1), Smoothened (Smo), Gli1, and Gli2 in reprogrammed cells. Stimulation of the hedgehog pathway resulted in the concerted movement of Ptch1 out of the cilia and Smo into the cilia, implying that the cilia on iPSCs contain functioning hedgehog machinery. The mean length of primary cilia in reprogrammed cells was shorter than those of parental human fibroblasts. Morphometric analyses revealed that reprogramming resulted in an increase in the curvature of primary cilia from â¼0.015 to 0.064âÎ¼m(-1), indicating an underlying approximately fourfold decrease in their rigidity, and a decrease in length of primary cilia from â¼2.38 to â¼1.45âÎ¼m.

These two domains are associated respectively with Foxa2 and Gata3, two transcription factors that play key roles in specifying them. Gata3 ChIP-seq experiments and RNA-seq assays on Gata3-knockdown cells revealed that Gata3 up-regulates the genes that are enriched in the Shh-Ptch1+ domain. Important Gata3 targets include Slit2 and Slit3, which are involved in the process of axon guidance, as well as Slc18a1, Th and Qdpr, which are associated with neurotransmitter synthesis and release.

RT-PCR analyses show developmentally regulated expression of sonic (Shh), indian (Ihh) and desert (Dhh) HH in the ovary. Expression is detected in whole ovary, granulosa cells, and corpora lutea. The mRNAs for the two receptors, patched homolog 1 and 2 (Ptch1, Ptch2), and the signal transducer, smoothened (Smo), are also expressed. Immunohistochemistry using an antibody that detects all three HH ligands demonstrated HH protein primarily in granulosa cells of follicles from primary to antral stages of development. Follicles also stained for PTCH1 and SMO in both granulosa and theca cells. Treatment of cultured preantral follicles and granulosa cells with recombinant SHH increased growth and proliferation while treatment with the HH pathway inhibitor, cyclopamine, had no effect. Therefore, activation of HH signaling can increase cell proliferation and follicle growth but is not essential for these processes in vitro. Treatment of granulosa cells with SHH increased levels of mRNA for Gli1, a transcriptional target of HH signaling, while cyclopamine decreased expression. SHH had no effect on production of progesterone by cultured granulosa cells, while cyclopamine increased progesterone production. The results demonstrate a functional HH pathway in the follicle and identify granulosa cells as at least one of the potential targets of HH signaling.",

For this purpose, the effect of EGCG/TF was investigated in liver lesions of different groups at pre-, continuous and post initiation stages of carcinogenesis. Comparatively increased body weights were evident due to EGCG/TF treatment than carcinogen control mice. Both EGCG and TF could restrict the development of hepatocellular carcinoma at 30th week of carcinogen application showing potential chemoprevention in continuous treated group (mild dysplasia) followed by pretreated (moderate dysplasia) and therapeutic efficacy in posttreated group (mild dysplasia). This restriction was associated with significantly reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, decreased prevalence of hepatocyte progenitor cell (AFP) and stem cell population (CD44) irrespective of EGCG/TF treatments. The EGCG/TF could modulate the Wnt pathway by reducing Î²-catenin and phospho-Î²-catenin-Y-654 expressions along with up-regulation of sFRP1 (secreted frizzled-related protein 1) and adenomatosis polyposis coli during the restriction. In case of the Hh pathway, EGCG/TF could also reduce expressions of glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (Gli1) and SMO (smoothened homolog) along with up-regulation of PTCH1 (patched homolog 1). As a result, in Wnt/Hh regulatory pathways decreased expressions of Î²-catenin/Gli1 target genes like CyclinD1, cMyc and EGFR/phospho-EGFR-Y-1173 and up-regulation of E-cadherin were seen during the restriction. Thus, the restriction of liver carcinogenesis by EGCG/TF was due to reduction in hepatocyte progenitor cell/stem cell population along with modulation of Wnt/Hh and other regulatory pathways. ",

To dissect the mechanisms through which Hh proteins promote angiogenesis, we analyzed processes inherent to vessel formation in endothelial cells. We found that none of the Hh ligands were able to induce Gli-target genes in human umbilical vein (HUVeC) or human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HMVeC), suggesting that endothelial cells do not respond to Hh through the canonical pathway. However, our results show that the three Hh proteins promote endothelial cell tubulogenesis in 3D cultures in a SMo- and Gi protein-dependent manner. Consistent with the required cytoskeletal re-arrangement for tubulogenesis, Shh, Ihh and Dhh all stimulated the small GTPase RhoA and the formation of actin stress fibers. This effect, which was mediated by SMO, Gi proteins and Rac1, defines a new non-canonical Hh pathway. In addition to regulating the actin cytoskeleton, the Hh ligands promoted survival through inhibition of the pro-apoptotic effect of PTCH1 in a SMO-independent manner. Altogether, our results support the existence of Gli-independent Hh responses in endothelial cells that regulate tubulogenesis and apoptosis. The identification of novel non-canonical responses elicited by Hh proteins in endothelial cells highlights the complexity of the Hh signaling pathway and reveals striking differences in ligand strength for transcriptional and non-transcriptional responses",

The role of ESR2 [estrogen receptor (ER)-Î²] in promoting Med growth was comprehensively examined in three in vivo models and human cell lines. In a novel Med ERÎ²-null knockout model developed by crossing Esr2(-/-) mice with cerebellar granule cell precursor specific Ptch1 conditional knockout mice, the tumor growth rate was significantly decreased in males and females. The absence of Esr2 resulted in increased apoptosis, decreased B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), and IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) expression, and decreased levels of active MAPKs (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (AKT). Treatment of Med in Ptch1(+/-) Trp53(-/-) mice with the antiestrogen chemotherapeutic drug Faslodex significantly increased symptom-free survival, which was associated with increased apoptosis and decreased BCL2 and IGF1R expression and signaling. Similar effects were also observed in nude mice bearing D283Med xenografts. In vitro studies in human D283Med cells metabolically stressed by glutamine withdrawal found that 17Î²-estradiol and the ERÎ² selective agonist 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile dose dependently protected Med cells from caspase-3-dependent cell death. Those effects were associated with increased phosphorylation of IGF1R, long-term increases in ERK1/2 and AKT signaling, and increased expression of IGF-1, IGF1R, and BCL2. Results of pharmacological experiments revealed that the cytoprotective actions of estradiol were dependent on ERÎ² and IGF1R receptor tyrosine kinase activity and independent of ERÎ± and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (G protein coupled receptor 30). The presented results demonstrate that estrogen promotes Med growth through ERÎ²-mediated increases in IGF1R expression and activity, which induce cytoprotective mechanisms that decrease apoptosis.

Shh signaling pathway modulation was also suggested in the healthy skin surrounding the wound bed, as evidenced by an increase in the number of GFP+ and Î²-Gal+Â cells in males at day 4. Gene expression analysis of the wounds confirmed increase in Ptch1 and showed the upregulation of a downstream transcription factor Gli3, involved in the vascular effect of the Shh pathway, implicating the pathway in the effect of MAA beads.

Sonic hedgehog (SHH), Indian hedgehog (IHH) and Desert hedgehog (DHH) bind to PTCH1/PTCH or PTCH2 receptor to release Smoothened (SMO) signal transducer from Patched-dependent suppression. SMO then activates STK36 serine/threonine kinase to stabilize GLI family members and to phosphorylate SUFU for nuclear accumulation of GLI. Hedgehog signaling activation leads to GLI-dependent transcriptional activation of target genes, such as GLI1, PTCH1, CCND2, FOXL1, JAG2 and SFRP1. GLI1-dependent positive feedback loop combined with PTCH1-dependent negative feedback loop gives rise to transient proliferation of Hedgehog target cells. Iguana homologs (DZIP1 and DZIP1L) and Costal-2 homologs (KIF7 and KIF27) are identified by comparative integromics. SHH-dependent parietal cell proliferation is implicated in gastric mucosal repair during chronic Helicobacter pylori infection. BMP-RUNX3 signaling induces IHH expression in surface differentiated epithelial cells of stomach and intestine. Hedgehog signals from epithelial cells then induces FOXL1-mediated BMP4 upregulation in mesenchymal cells. Hedgehog signaling is frequently activated in esophageal cancer, gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer due to transcriptional upregulation of Hedgehog ligands and epigenetic silencing of HHIP1/HHIP gene, encoding the Hedgehog inhibitor. However, Hedgehog signaling is rarely activated in colorectal cancer due to negative regulation by the canonical WNT signaling pathway. Hedgehog signaling molecules or targets, such as SHH, IHH, HHIP1, PTCH1 and GLI1, are applied as biomarkers for cancer diagnostics, prognostics and therapeutics. Small-molecule inhibitors for SMO or STK36 are suitable to be used for treatment of Hedgehog-dependent cancer.",

PTCH1 germline mutations cause Gorlin syndrome, a disorder characterized by developmental abnormalities and tumor susceptibility. The autosomal dominant inheritance, and the evidence for PTCH1 haploinsufficiency, suggests that fine-tuning systems of protein patched homolog 1 (PTC1) levels exist to properly regulate the pathway. Given the role of 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) in protein expression, our aim was to thoroughly explore cis-regulatory elements in the 5'UTR of PTCH1 transcript 1b. The (CGG)n polymorphism was the main potential regulatory element studied so far but with inconsistent results and no clear association between repeat number and disease risk. Using luciferase reporter constructs in human cell lines here we show that the number of CGG repeats has no strong impact on gene expression, both at mRNA and protein levels. We observed variability in the length of 5'UTR and changes in abundance of the associated transcripts after pathway activation. We show that upstream AUG codons (uAUGs) present only in longer 5'UTRs could negatively regulate the amount of PTC1 isoform L (PTC1-L). The existence of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) observed using different approaches and mapped in the region comprising the CGG repeats, would counteract the effect of the uAUGs and enable synthesis of PTC1-L under stressful conditions, such as during hypoxia. Higher relative translation efficiency of PTCH1b mRNA in HEK 293T cultured hypoxia was observed by polysomal profiling and Western blot analyses. All our results point to an exceptionally complex and so far unexplored role of 5'UTR PTCH1b cis-element features in the regulation of the Hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway. ",

Aberrant HH signaling within GNPs is thought to give rise to medulloblastoma (MB) - the most commonly-observed form of malignant pediatric brain tumor. Evidence in both invertebrates and vertebrates indicates that cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) antagonizes HH signalling. Receptors specific for the neuropeptide pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP, gene name ADCYAP1) are expressed in GNPs. PACAP has been shown to protect GNPs from apoptosis in vitro, and to interact with HH signaling to regulate GNP proliferation. PACAP/ptch1 double mutant mice exhibit an increased incidence of MB compared to ptch1 mice, indicating that PACAP may regulate HH pathway-mediated MB pathogenesis.;Primary MB tumorsphere cultures were prepared from thirteen ptch1+/-/p53+/- double mutant mice and treated with the smoothened (SMO) agonist purmorphamine, the SMO antagonist SANT-1, the neuropeptide PACAP, the PKA activator forskolin, and the PKA inhibitor H89. Gene expression of gli1 and [3H]-thymidine incorporation were assessed to determine drug effects on HH pathway activity and proliferation, respectively. PKA activity was determined in cell extracts by Western blotting using a phospho-PKA substrate antibody.;Primary tumor cells cultured for 1-week under serum-free conditions grew as tumorspheres and were found to express PAC1 receptor transcripts. Gli1 gene expression was significantly reduced by SANT-1, PACAP and forskolin, but was unaffected by purmorphamine. The attenuation of gli1 gene expression by PACAP was reversed by the PKA inhibitor H89, which also blocked PKA activation. Treatment of tumorsphere cultures with PACAP, forskolin, and SANT-1 for 24 or 48 hours reduced proliferation.;Primary tumorspheres derived from ptch1+/-/p53+/- mice exhibit constitutive HH pathway activity. PACAP antagonizes HH signalling in these cells in a manner blocked by the PKA antagonist H89. PACAP and pharmacological activation of PKA also inhibited proliferation. Our data suggests that regulation of HH signaling by PACAP/PKA signaling may provide an alternative to SMO inhibition for the treatment of MB.",

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by chronic synovitis and pannus formation associated with activation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). We investigated whether Shh signaling plays a role in the proliferation of FLS in RA. Expression of Shh signaling related components (Shh, Ptch1, Smo, and Gli1) in RA synovial tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in FLS by IHC, immunofluorescence (IF), quantitative RT-PCR, and western blotting. Expression of Shh, Smo, and Gli1 in RA synovial tissue was higher than that in control tissue (P < 0.05). Cyclopamine (a specific inhibitor of Shh signaling) decreased mRNA expression of Shh, Ptch1, Smo, and Gli1 in cultured RA FLS, Shh, and Smo protein expression, and significantly decreased FLS proliferation. Flow cytometry analysis suggested that cyclopamine treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest of FLS in G1 phase. Our data show that Shh signaling is activated in synovium of RA patients in vivo and in cultured FLS form RA patients in vitro, suggesting a role in the proliferation of FLS in RA.

We detected the effect of sonic hedgehog (Shh) and cyclopamine on the in vitro maturation of mouse oocytes and embryo development. The results showed that the presence of Shh or cyclopamine resulted in similar oocyte maturation to control groups. Shh did not improve early embryonic development. However, the supplement of cyclopamine depressed early embryo development. The mRNA of shh, ptch1, smo and gli1 were less detected in the denuded oocytes. The expression levels of ptch1 ascended from the uncleaved zygote to blastocyst stage. Smo or gli1 were expressed on a higher level at the two-cell or four-cell stage in early embryonic development separately.

        "Doc_abstract":"Intellectual disability in Down syndrome (DS) appears to be related to severe proliferation impairment during brain development. Recent evidence shows that it is not only cellular proliferation that is heavily compromised in DS, but also cell fate specification and dendritic maturation. The amyloid precursor protein (APP), a gene that is triplicated in DS, plays a key role in normal brain development by influencing neural precursor cell proliferation, cell fate specification, and neuronal maturation. APP influences these processes via two separate domains, the APP intracellular domain (AICD) and the soluble secreted APP. We recently found that the proliferation impairment of neuronal precursors (NPCs) from the Ts65Dn mouse model for DS was caused by derangement of the Shh pathway due to overexpression of patched1(Ptch1), its inhibitory regulator. Ptch1 overexpression was related to increased levels within the APP/AICD system. The overall goal of this study was to determine whether APP contributes to neurogenesis impairment in DS by influencing in addition to proliferation, cell fate specification, and neurite development. We found that normalization of APP expression restored the reduced neuronogenesis, the increased astrogliogenesis, and the reduced neurite length of trisomic NPCs, indicating that APP overexpression underpins all aspects of neurogenesis impairment. Moreover, we found that two different domains of APP impair neuronal differentiation and maturation in trisomic NPCs. The APP/AICD system regulates neuronogenesis and neurite length through the Shh pathway, whereas the APP/secreted AP system promotes astrogliogenesis through an IL-6-associated signaling cascade. These results provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying brain development alterations in DS. ",

Recent studies (Kerr et al., Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2012; 53, 3316-30) showed that conditionally activating Hh signals promotes murine lens epithelial cell proliferation and disrupts fibre differentiation. In this study we examined the expression of the Hh pathway and the requirement for the Smoothened gene in murine lens development. Expression of Hh pathway components in developing lens was examined by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and in situ hybridisation. The requirement of Smo in lens development was determined by conditional loss-of-function mutations, using LeCre and MLR10 Cre transgenic mice. The phenotype of mutant mice was examined by immunofluorescence for various markers of cell cycle, lens and cornea differentiation. Hh pathway components (Ptch1, Smo, Gli2, Gli3) were detected in lens epithelium from E12.5. Gli2 was particularly localised to mitotic nuclei and, at E13.5, Gli3 exhibited a shift from cytosol to nucleus, suggesting distinct roles for these transcription factors. Conditional deletion of Smo, from â¼E12.5 (MLR10 Cre) did not affect ocular development, whereas deletion from â¼E9.5 (LeCre) resulted in lens and corneal defects from E14.5. Mutant lenses were smaller and showed normal expression of p57Kip2, c-Maf, E-cadherin and Pax6, reduced expression of FoxE3 and Ptch1 and decreased nuclear Hes1. There was normal G1-S phase but decreased G2-M phase transition at E16.5 and epithelial cell death from E14.5-E16.5. Mutant corneas were thicker due to aberrant migration of Nrp2+ cells from the extraocular mesenchyme, resulting in delayed corneal endothelial but normal epithelial differentiation. These results indicate the Hh pathway is required during a discrete period (E9.5-E12.5) in lens development to regulate lens epithelial cell proliferation, survival and FoxE3 expression. Defective corneal development occurs secondary to defects in lens and appears to be due to defective migration of peri-ocular Nrp2+ neural crest/mesenchymal cells. ",

Analysis of Disp1 null mutant embryos has demonstrated that Disp1 plays a key role in hedgehog signaling in the early mouse embryo. Here we have used a hypomorphic allele in Disp1(Disp1(Delta)(2)), to extend our knowledge of Disp1 function in Hh-mediated patterning of the mammalian embryo. Through genetic combinations with null alleles of patched 1 (Ptch1), sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Indian hedgehog (Ihh), we demonstrate that Disp1 genetically interacts with Hh signaling components. As Disp1 activity is decreased we see a progressive increase in the severity of hedgehog-dependent phenotypes, which is further enhanced by reducing hedgehog ligand levels. Analysis of neural tube patterning demonstrates a progressive loss of ventral cell identities that most likely reflects decreased Shh signaling as Disp1 levels are attenuated. Conversely, increasing available Shh ligand by decreasing Ptch1 dosage leads to the restoration of ventral cell types in Disp1(Delta2/Delta2) mutants. Together, these studies suggest that Disp1 actively regulates the levels of hedgehog ligand that are available to the hedgehog target field. Further, they provide additional support for the dose-dependent action of Shh signaling in patterning the embryo. Finally, in-vitro studies on Disp1 null mutant fibroblasts indicate that Disp1 is not essential for membrane targeting or release of lipid-modified Shh ligand.",

To understand the regulatory processes of miRNAs on genes, integrative computer-aided approaches are essential, especially in the light of complex human diseases as cancer.;Here, we present miRTrail, an integrative tool that allows for performing comprehensive analyses of interactions of genes and miRNAs based on expression profiles. The integrated analysis of mRNA and miRNA data should generate more robust and reliable results on deregulated pathogenic processes and may also offer novel insights into the regulatory interactions between miRNAs and genes. Our web-server excels in carrying out gene sets analysis, analysis of miRNA sets as well as the combination of both in a systems biology approach. To this end, miRTrail integrates information on 20.000 genes, almost 1.000 miRNAs, and roughly 280.000 putative interactions, for Homo sapiens and accordingly for Mus musculus and Danio rerio. The well-established, classical Chi-squared test is one of the central techniques of our tool for the joint consideration of miRNAs and their targets. For interactively visualizing obtained results, it relies on the network analyzers and viewers BiNA or Cytoscape-web, also enabling direct access to relevant literature. We demonstrated the potential of miRTrail by applying our tool to mRNA and miRNA data of malignant melanoma. MiRTrail identified several deregulated miRNAs that target deregulated mRNAs including miRNAs hsa-miR-23b and hsa-miR-223, which target the highest numbers of deregulated mRNAs and regulate the pathway \"basal cell carcinoma\". In addition, both miRNAs target genes like PTCH1 and RASA1 that are involved in many oncogenic processes.;The application on melanoma samples demonstrates that the miRTrail platform may open avenues for investigating the regulatory interactions between genes and miRNAs for a wide range of human diseases. Moreover, miRTrail cannot only be applied to microarray based expression profiles, but also to NGS-based transcriptomic data.

In this model, MAA beads improved vascularization in healthy mice of both sexes compared to control poly(methyl methacrylate) (MM) beads, with a stronger effect seen in males than females. MAA-induced vessels were perfusable, as evidenced from the CLARITY-processed images. In Shh-Cre-eGFP/Ptch1-LacZ non-diabetic transgenic mice, the increased vessel formation was accompanied by a higher density of cells expressing GFP (Shh) and Î²-Gal (patched 1, Ptch1) suggesting MAA enhanced the activation of the Shh pathway. Ptch1 is the Shh receptor and a target of the pathway. MAA beads also modulated the inflammatory cell infiltrate in CD1 mice: more neutrophils and more macrophages were noted with MAA relative to MM beads at days 1 and 7, respectively. In addition, MAA beads biased macrophages towards a MHCII-CD206+ (\"M2\") polarization state.

Later, components of hedgehog signalling were analysed in the bone marrow of both control and pesticide-treated aplastic groups of animals. The results depicted pancytopenic feature of peripheral blood, developmental anomaly of neutrophils, depression of primitive stem and progenitor population along with Shh, Ptch1, Smo and Gli1 expression in aplasia group.

We analyzed gene expression, cell viability, apoptosis, and tumorigenic capability before and after cyclopamine treatment in CD133 high-expressing and CD133 low-expressing cell lines. All medulloblastoma and PNET cell lines displayed an inhibitory effect on the expression of SHH pathway genes, on viability, and on tumorigenic potential after treatment.

Defects in ciliary assembly or function lead to a series of developmental disorders and diseases commonly referred to as ciliopathies. Still, little is known about the formation and function of primary cilia in the mammalian testis. Here, we characterized primary cilia in adult human testis and report a constitutive expression of cilia in peritubular myoid cells and a dynamic expression of cilia in differentiating Leydig cells. Primary cilia are generally absent from cells of mature seminiferous epithelium, but present in Sertoli cell-only tubules in Klinefelter syndrome testis. Peritubular cells in atrophic testis produce overly long cilia. Furthermore cultures of growth-arrested immature mouse Leydig cells express primary cilia that are enriched in components of Hedgehog signalling, including Smoothened, Patched-1, and GLI2, which are involved in regulating Leydig cell differentiation. Stimulation of Hedgehog signalling increases the localization of Smoothened to the cilium, which is followed by transactivation of the Hedgehog target genes, Gli1 and Ptch1. Our findings provide new information on the spatiotemporal formation of primary cilia in the testis and show that primary cilia in immature Leydig cells mediate Hedgehog signalling. ",

First, we built an expression vector in which the Oct3/4 promoter drives the monocistronic transcription of Venus and a puromycin-resistant gene via the foot-and-mouth disease virus self-cleaving peptide T2A. Then, a genetically-engineered mESC line with the stable integration of this vector was isolated and cultured in the presence or absence of puromycin. The cultures were subsequently subjected to Illumina expression microarray analysis. We identified approximately 4600 probes with statistically significant differential expression. The genes involved in nucleic acid synthesis were overrepresented in the probe set associated with mESCs maintained in the presence of puromycin. In contrast, the genes involved in cell differentiation were overrepresented in the probe set associated with mESCs maintained in the absence of puromycin. Therefore, it is suggested with these data that the transcriptional activity of Oct3/4 fluctuates in mESCs and that Oct3/4 plays an essential role in sustaining the basal transcriptional activities required for cell duplication in populations with equal differentiation potential. Heterogeneity in the transcriptional activity of Oct3/4 was dynamic. Interestingly, we found that genes involved in the hedgehog signaling pathway showed unique expression profiles in mESCs and validated this observation by RT-PCR analysis. The expression of Gli2, Ptch1 and Smo was consistently detected in other types of pluripotent stem cells examined in this study. Furthermore, the Gli2 protein was heterogeneously detected in mESC nuclei by immunofluorescence microscopy and this result correlated with the detection of the Oct3/4 protein. Finally, forced activation of Gli2 in mESCs increased their proliferation rate. Collectively, it is suggested with these results that Gli2 may play a novel role in the self-renewal of pluripotent stem cells.",

Hedgehog signaling is a highly conserved pathway regulating morphogenesis in early development and tumorigenesis postnatally. Recently, advanced molecular biology has revealed that components of hedgehog signaling such as PTCH1, SMO, and GLI specifically translocate within the primary cilium upon the ligand binding of the hedgehog protein, and transduce the biological growth signal from the cell surface to the nucleus. Haploinsufficiency of the components in the primary cilium would inhibit the hedgehog pathway, resulting in developmental anomalies like ventral neural tube defects.

Levels of the hedgehog target genes Gli1 and Ptch1 in wildtype mice were upregulated in fracture calluses throughout the repair process. Forced activation of the hedgehog pathway in ubiquitous fashion resulted in increased matrix deposition in the fracture callus. Interestingly, inhibition in chondrocytes did not alter the fracture repair phenotype, while activation of hedgehog in osteoblasts was a requirement for normal fracture repair. In vitro, transcript levels of Gli1 and Ptch1 were elevated during osteoblastogenesis. Activation of hedgehog signaling positively affected osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization as detected using alkaline phosphatase and Von Kossa staining and Alp and Col1 expression.

Mouse and human keratocysts expressed similar markers, leading to tooth misalignment, bone remodeling, and craniofacial abnormalities. We detected Hh target gene expression in epithelial cells lining keratocysts from both species, implicating deregulated Hh signaling in their development. Most mouse keratocysts arose from rests of Malassez--quiescent, residual embryonic epithelial cells that remain embedded in the periodontal ligament surrounding mature teeth. In Gli2-expressing mice, these rests were stimulated to proliferate, stratify, and form a differentiated squamous epithelium. The frequent development of keratocysts in Gli2-expressing mice supports the idea that GLI transcription factor activity mediates pathological responses to deregulated Hh signaling in humans. Moreover, Gli2-mediated reactivation of quiescent epithelial rests to form keratocysts indicates that these cells retain the capacity to function as progenitor cells on activation by an appropriate developmental signal.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Cilia are highly conserved organelles, which serve critical roles in development and physiology. Motile cilia are expressed in a limited range of tissues, where they principally regulate local extracellular fluid dynamics. In contrast, primary cilia are expressed by many vertebrate cell types during interphase, and are intimately involved in the cell cycle and signal transduction. Notably, primary cilia are essential for vertebrate hedgehog pathway activity. Improved detection of motile cilia may assist in the diagnosis of some pathologic entities such as Rathke's cleft cysts, whereas characterizing primary cilia in neoplastic tissues may implicate cilia-dependent signaling pathways as critical for tumorigenesis. We show that immunohistochemistry for the nuclear transcription factor FOXJ1, a master regulator of motile ciliogenesis, robustly labels the motile ciliated epithelium of Rathke's cleft cysts. FOXJ1 expression discriminates Rathke's cleft cysts from entities in the sellar/suprasellar region with overlapping histologic features such as craniopharyngiomas. Co-immunohistochemistry for FOXJ1 and markers that highlight motile cilia such as acetylated tubulin (TUBA4A) and the small GTPase ARL13B further enhance the ability to identify diagnostic epithelial cells. In addition to highlighting motile cilia, ARL13B immunohistochemistry also robustly highlights primary cilia in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. Primary cilia are present throughout the neoplastic epithelium of adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma, but are limited to basally oriented cells near the fibrovascular stroma in papillary craniopharyngioma. Consistent with this differing pattern of primary ciliation, adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas express significantly higher levels of SHH, and downstream targets such as PTCH1 and GLI2, compared with papillary craniopharyngiomas. In conclusion, motile ciliated epithelium can be readily identified using immunohistochemistry for FOXJ1, TUBA4A, and ARL13B, facilitating the diagnosis of Rathke's cleft cysts. Primary cilia can be identified by ARL13B immunohistochemistry in routine pathology specimens.

Several recent observations suggest the involvement of sonic hedgehog (SHH) in postnatal neovascularization. We identified a novel role for SHH in tumor-associated angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that patched homolog 1 (PTCH1), both a receptor for and transcriptional target of hedgehog signaling, was expressed in a small fraction of endothelial cells within pancreatic cancer, but not in normal pancreatic tissue. When endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) isolated from human peripheral blood were cultured with supernatant from SHH-transfected 293 cells or pancreatic cancer cells, mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stromal cell-derived factor-1 and angiopoietin-1 were significantly increased, whereas no such induction was observed in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) and human dermal microvascular endothelial cell (HMVEC). HUVEC tube formation was stimulated when cocultured with EPC, and preconditioning EPC with supernatant from KP-1 N pancreatic cancer cells highly expressing SHH significantly enhanced the effect. The effect was partially attenuated by specific inhibition of SHH with cyclopamine or a neutralizing antibody. These findings suggest that tumor-derived SHH can induce angiogenesis, and this is mediated by its effects on EPC specifically. Targeting SHH would be a novel therapeutic approach that can inhibit not only proliferation of cancer cells but also EPC-mediated angiogenesis.",

The BA treatment caused a massive induction of apoptosis mediated by the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, which could be inhibited by the broad-range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk. Exposure of hedgehog-activated RMS-13 cells to BA resulted in a strong decrease in GLI1, GLI2, PTCH1, and IGF2 expression as well as hedgehog-responsive luciferase activity. Intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg BA per kg per day significantly retarded growth of RMS-13 xenografts in association with markedly higher counts of apoptotic cells and down-regulation of GLI1 expression compared with control tumours, while leaving microvascular density, cell proliferation, and myogenic differentiation unaffected.;Our data show that induction of apoptosis and inhibition of hedgehog signalling are important features of the anti-tumourigenic effect of BA in RMS and advices this compound for the use in a multimodal therapy of this highly aggressive paediatric tumour.",

To date, the vast majority of these effects are described in cell-culture systems, while in vivo validation and assessment of biological consequences within an organism remain uncertain. Here, we describe the neonatal mouse cerebellum as an accurate in vivo model to detect, quantify, and mechanistically dissect radiation-bystander responses. DNA double-strand breaks and apoptotic cell death were induced in bystander cerebellum in vivo. Accompanying these genetic events, we report bystander-related tumor induction in cerebellum of radiosensitive Patched-1 (Ptch1) heterozygous mice after x-ray exposure of the remainder of the body. We further show that genetic damage is a critical component of in vivo oncogenic bystander responses, and provide evidence supporting the role of gap-junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in transmission of bystander signals in the central nervous system (CNS). These results represent the first proof-of-principle that bystander effects are factual in vivo events with carcinogenic potential, and implicate the need for re-evaluation of approaches currently used to estimate radiation-associated health risks.",

Inactivation of one Ptch1 allele in the mouse results in the development of medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the latter being a malignant tumor of skeletal muscle origin. To identify genes involved in the pathogenesis of Ptch1-associated RMS, we have monitored the expression of 588 genes in RMS and normal skeletal muscle (SM) of heterozygous Ptch1neo67/+ mice using cDNA array technology. RMS displayed increased transcript levels of several genes such as transforming growth factor-beta1 (Tgfb1), insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2), villin 2 (Vil2), integrin beta1 (Itgb1), Sloan-Kettering viral oncogene homolog (Ski), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (Igfbp3), as well as numerous genes coding for structural components of myogenic cells such as myosin light polypeptide 4 (Myl4), myosin light polypeptide 6 (Myl6), and vimentin (Vim). Detailed promoter analysis revealed a putative Gli binding site in the second promoter region (P2) of the murine Tgfb1 gene. However, using reporter assay we show that the P2 promoter is not responsive to hedgehog signaling. We furthermore describe that Tgfb1 expression could not be activated in C2C12 myoblasts in the presence of murine Shh-N peptide and that Tgfb1 is equally expressed in both wild-type and Ptch1-deficient mouse embryos. In line with this, TGFB1 was strongly expressed in human RMS cell lines independently of the GLI1 expression status. In summary, our results suggest that aberrant expression of Tgfb1 may be involved in RMS development in a way that is independent of hedgehog signaling.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Neurogenesis impairment starting from early developmental stages is a key determinant of intellectual disability in Down syndrome (DS). Previous evidence provided a causal relationship between neurogenesis impairment and malfunctioning of the mitogenic Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway. In particular, excessive levels of AICD (amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain), a cleavage product of the trisomic gene APP (amyloid precursor protein) up-regulate transcription of Ptch1 (Patched1), the Shh receptor that keeps the pathway repressed. Since AICD results from APP cleavage by Î³-secretase, the goal of the current study was to establish whether treatment with a Î³-secretase inhibitor normalizes AICD levels and restores neurogenesis in trisomic neural precursor cells. We found that treatment with a selective Î³-secretase inhibitor (ELND006; ELN) restores proliferation in neurospheres derived from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. This effect was accompanied by reduction of AICD and Ptch1 levels and was prevented by inhibition of the Shh pathway with cyclopamine. Treatment of Ts65Dn mice with ELN in the postnatal period P3-P15 restored neurogenesis in the SVZ and hippocampus, hippocampal granule cell number and synapse development, indicating a positive impact of treatment on brain development. In addition, in the hippocampus of treated Ts65Dn mice there was a reduction in the expression levels of various genes that are transcriptionally regulated by AICD, including APP, its origin substrate. Inhibitors of Î³-secretase are currently envisaged as tools for the cure of Alzheimer's disease because they lower Î²amyloid levels. Current results provide novel evidence that Î³-secretase inhibitors may represent a strategy for the rescue of neurogenesis defects in DS. ",

Eyelid closure requires shape change and migration of epithelial cells at the tip of the developing eyelids, and is dictated by numerous signaling pathways. Here we evaluated gene expression in epithelial cells isolated from the tip (leading edge, LE) and inner surface epithelium (IE) of the eyelid from E15.5 mouse fetuses by laser capture microdissection (LCM). We showed that the LE and IE cells are different at E15.5, such that IE had higher expression of muscle specific genes, while LE acquired epithelium identities. Despite their distinct destinies, these cells were overall similar in expression of signaling components for the \"eyelid closure pathways\". However, while the LE cells had more abundant expression of Fgfr2, Erbb2, Shh, Ptch1 and 2, Smo and Gli2, and Jag1 and Notch1, the IE cells had more abundant expression of Bmp5 and Bmpr1a. In addition, the LE cells had more abundant expression of adenomatosis polyposis coli down-regulated 1 (Apcdd1), but the IE cells had high expression of Dkk2. Our results suggest that the functionally distinct LE and IE cells have also differential expression of signaling molecules that may contribute to the cell-specific responses to morphogenetic signals. The expression pattern suggests that the EGF, Shh and NOTCH pathways are preferentially active in LE cells, the BMP pathways are effective in IE cells, and the Wnt pathway may be repressed in LE and IE cells via different mechanisms.

Then we examined these three SNPs in 171 HCC samples and 162 normal liver samples. However, statistic analysis showed none of these SNPs was statistically significant for association with HCC.

Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is expressed by RGCs, and we showed previously that it is required for the specification of astrocyte lineage cells at the optic disc. To study the role of RGC-derived Shh on astrocyte development at later developmental stages, we generated mice with a conditional ablation of Shh in the peripheral retina and analyzed gene expression and glial cell development in the optic nerve. Astrocyte development was initiated in the optic nerves of these mutant mice; however, the expression of Hedgehog (Hh) target genes, Gli1 and Ptch1 and cell cycle genes, Ccnd1 and Cdc25b in the optic nerves were downregulated. Astrocyte proliferation was markedly reduced. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells were fewer in the optic nerves of mutant mice, possibly as a consequence of reduced secretion of growth factors by astrocytes. At a later developmental stage, optic nerve axons displayed signs of Wallerian degeneration, including reduction of astrocyte processes, degenerating glial cells and formation of distended axons. We also demonstrate that the Hh pathway can be activated in optic nerve-derived astrocytes in vitro, but fails to induce cell cycle gene expression and proliferation. RGC-derived Shh signalling isthus necessary in vivo for maintenance of astrocyte proliferation, affecting both axo-glial and normal glial cell development in the optic nerve.",

First, we localised interleukin (IL)-18 by immunohistochemistry to the marginal cell layer of Rathke's pouch that is assumed to embody a stem/progenitor cell compartment of the postnatal pituitary gland. A cloned anterior pituitary-derived cell line from the bovine anterior pituitary gland was established from single cell clone by the limiting dilution method and was designated as bovine anterior pituitary-derived cell line (BAPC)-1. BAPC-1 cells constantly expressed mRNAs for IL-18 and IL-18 receptor, and grew steadily and rapidly in the medium containing epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. The cell line also expressed the mRNAs for the stem/progenitor cell- related factors such as Nanog, Oct-4, Ptch1, Nestin, Notch1, Hes1, Lrp and Fzd4, and the mRNAs for embryonic pituitary-related factors, such as Lhx3, PitX1 and Pit-1. The nuclei of BAPC-1 were immunostained positively for Pit-1, Hes1 and beta-catenin antibodies. Furthermore, BAPC-1 cells expressed mRNAs for cytokine such as IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-7, IL-12 and IL-15. Stimulation of BAPC-1 cells with IL-18 increased expression of mRNAs for IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta and IL-8. At day 6 in culture, BAPC-1 cells also express growth hormone mRNA.

Despite the development of potent Hh pathway antagonists, medulloblastoma drug resistance is still an unresolved issue that requires the identification of novel drug targets. Following up on our observation that histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) expression was increased in Hh-driven medulloblastoma, we found that this enzyme is essential for full Hh pathway activation. Intriguingly, these stimulatory effects of HDAC6 are partly integrated downstream of primary cilia, a known HDAC6-regulated structure. In addition, HDAC6 is also required for the complete repression of basal Hh target gene expression. These contrasting effects are mediated by HDAC6's impact on Gli2 mRNA and GLI3 protein expression. As a result of this complex interaction with Hh signaling, global transcriptome analysis revealed that HDAC6 regulates only a subset of Smoothened- and Gli-driven genes, including all well-established Hh targets such as Ptch1 or Gli1. Importantly, medulloblastoma cell survival was severely compromised by HDAC6 inhibition in vitro and pharmacologic HDAC6 blockade strongly reduced tumor growth in an in vivo allograft model. In summary, our data describe an important role for HDAC6 in regulating the mammalian Hh pathway and encourage further studies focusing on HDAC6 as a novel drug target in medulloblastoma.",

In this study, we established an animal model of neural tube defects (NTDs) using MTX to investigate the role of apoptosis and proliferation in NTDs caused by folate deficiency. Differential gene expressions were studied by microarray and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in the NTD animal model. Results showed that 30.8% of NTDs were caused by using MTX in treatment regimens. Microarray indicated that 166 genes were significantly different between the control and NTD mice, including four apoptosis-related genes (Endog, Trp53, Casp3, Bax) and three proliferation-related genes (Ptch1, Pla2g4a, Foxg1). Levels of Endog, Trp53, Casp3, Bax (fold change>1.5) were upregulated but Ptch1, Pla2g4a, Foxg1 (fold change<0.67) were downregulated (P<0.05). These results were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

All individuals with DS exhibit some degree of brain structural changes and cognitive impairment; mouse models such as Ts65Dn have been instrumental in understanding the underlying mechanisms. Several phenotypes of DS might arise from a reduced response of trisomic cells to the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) growth factor. If all trisomic cells show a similar reduced response to SHH, then up-regulation of the pathway in trisomic cells might ameliorate multiple DS phenotypes. We crossed Ptch1tm1Mps/+ mice, in which the canonical SHH pathway is expected to be up-regulated in every SHH-responsive cell due to the loss of function of one allele of the pathway suppressor, Ptch1, to the Ts65Dn DS model and assessed the progeny for possible rescue of multiple DS-related phenotypes. Down-regulation of Ptch produced several previously unreported effects on development by itself, complicating interpretation of some phenotypes, and a number of structural or behavioral effects of trisomy were not compensated by SHH signaling. However, a deficit in a nest-building task was partially restored in Ts;Ptch+/- mice, as were the structural anomalies of the cerebellum seen in Ts65Dn mice.

Several membrane-embedded proteins such as Boc, Cdo, and Gas1 bind Shh and promote signaling. In addition, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) have also been implicated in the initiation of Shh responses. However, the attributes of HSPGs that function as co-receptors for Shh have not yet been defined. Here, we identify HSPGs containing a glypican 5 core protein and 2-O-sulfo-iduronic acid residues at the nonreducing ends of the glycans as co-receptors for Shh. These HSPG co-receptors are expressed by cerebellar granule cell precursors and promote Shh binding and signaling. At the subcellular level, these HSPG co-receptors are located adjacent to the primary cilia that act as Shh signaling organelles.

We showed that silencing of miRNA-10b by baculoviral decoy vectors in a glioma cell line resembling the mesenchymal subtype of GBM reduces its growth, invasion and angiogenesis while promoting apoptosis in vitro.

We demonstrated that the pleiotropic nature of miRNA-10b was due to its suppression of multiple tumor suppressors, including TP53, FOXO3, CYLD, PAX6, PTCH1, HOXD10 and NOTCH1. In particular, siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments identified TP53, PAX6, NOTCH1 and HOXD10 as invasion regulatory genes in our mesenchymal subtype-like glioma cells. By interrogating the REMBRANDT, we noted that dysregulation of many direct targets of miRNA-10b was associated with significantly poorer patient survival.

This is because in their absence, Gas1, an Hh-binding protein not present in Drosophila, mediates Hh signaling. Consistently, only CGNPs lacking all three molecules-Boc, Cdon, and Gas1-have a complete loss of Hh-dependent proliferation. In a complementary manner, we find that a mutated Hh ligand that binds Patched1 but not Boc, Cdon, or Gas1 cannot activate Hh signaling. Together, this demonstrates an absolute requirement for Boc, Cdon, and Gas1 in Hh signaling and reveals a distinct requirement for ligand-binding components that distinguishes the vertebrate and invertebrate Hh receptor systems.",

We found that mRNA levels of the Hedgehog pathway effector Gli1 were significantly associated with BclII expression in medulloblastoma and that Gli1 and BclII are both present in regions of decreased apoptosis in nodular medulloblastoma. Transient overexpression of Gli1 and Gli2 in medulloblastoma cultures induced a BclII transcriptional reporter and increased BclII protein levels, whereas stable overexpression of Gli1 was associated with increased BclII mRNA. The Hedgehog antagonist cyclopamine blocked expression of the Hh pathway targets PTCH1 and Gli1, lowered BclII levels, and increased apoptosis in DAOY and UW228 medulloblastoma cells. Apoptotic induction caused by cyclopamine could be rescued in part by enforced expression of Gli1 or BclII.

Real-time PCR showed that ATO decreased the expression of Hedgehog target genes, including PTCH1, GLI1, and GLI2, in human osteosarcoma cell lines. WST-1 assay and colony formation assay revealed that ATO prevented osteosarcoma growth. These findings show that ATO prevents GLI transcription and osteosarcoma growth in vitro. Flow cytometric analysis showed that ATO promoted apoptotic cell death. Comet assay showed that ATO treatment increased accumulation of DNA damage. Western blot analysis showed that ATO treatment increased the expression of Î³H2AX, cleaved PARP, and cleaved caspase-3. In addition, ATO treatment decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. These findings suggest that ATO treatment promoted apoptotic cell death caused by accumulation of DNA damage. In contrast, Sonic Hedgehog treatment decreased the expression of Î³H2AX induced by cisplatin treatment. ATO re-induced the accumulation of DNA damage attenuated by Sonic Hedgehog treatment. These findings suggest that ATO inhibits the activation of Hedgehog signaling and promotes apoptotic cell death in osteosarcoma cells by accumulation of DNA damage.

Recent work has shown that prostate cancer cells can acquire steroidogenic activity as they progress to a therapeutic-resistant state. However, benign prostate stromal cells (PrSCs) also have steroidogenic potential though they are often overlooked as a source of intratumoral androgens. Here, we present preliminary studies showing that the steroidogenic activity of primary human PrSCs is significantly increased by exposure to a Hedgehog agonist (SAG) or by transduction of PrSCs with lentiviruses that expresses active Gli2 (Gli2ÎN), a transcription factor that is triggered by Hh signaling. Comparative gene expression profiling on Chips, that was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR, revealed that hedgehog agonist treatment induced in these cells expressions of hedgehog target genes (Gli1, Ptch1, and SCUBE1) plus a specific cadre of genes involved in cholesterol/steroid biosynthesis, metabolism, and transport. Genes involved downstream in steroid hormone generation, including CYP17A1 and CYP19A1 were also induced. Both the hedgehog agonist and the Gli2-expressing lentivirus significantly increased the output of testosterone (T) from PrSCs that were supplemented with dihydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an adrenal precursor of T. Finally, knockdown of Gli2 by siRNA suppressed the ability of SAG to induce this response.

Therefore, we hypothesized that Hedgehog signaling may be altered in human GIST and controls KIT expression. Quantitative RT-PCR, microarrays, and next generation sequencing were used to describe Hedgehog/PC-related genes in purified human ICC and GIST. Genetic and pharmacologic approaches were employed to investigate the effects of GLI manipulation on KIT expression and GIST cell viability. We report that Hedgehog pathway and PC components are expressed in ICC and GIST and subject to dysregulation during GIST oncogenesis, irrespective of KIT/PDGFRA mutation status. Using genomic profiling, 10.2% of 186 GIST studied had potentially deleterious genomic alterations in 5 Hedgehog-related genes analyzed, including in the PTCH1 tumor suppressor (1.6%). Expression of the predominantly repressive GLI isoform, GLI3, was inversely correlated with KIT mRNA levels in GIST cells and non-KIT/non-PDGFRA mutant GIST. Overexpression of the 83-kDa repressive form of GLI3 or small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the activating isoforms GLI1/2 reduced KIT mRNA. Treatment with GLI1/2 inhibitors, including arsenic trioxide, significantly increased GLI3 binding to the KIT promoter, decreased KIT expression, and reduced viability in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant GIST cells.

In the mesoderm of the cloacal region, the over-expression of the constitutively active form of mouse Gli2 has been shown to: not induce cloacal partitioning along the D-V axis; induce expression of Ptch1, Gli2, bmp4, wnt5a, and hoxd-13, which have been previously shown to play a role in hindgut patterning; increase cell proliferation; and reduce apoptosis. Interestingly, p63 expression in the cloacal endoderm is also up-regulated, suggesting an interaction between the Shh and p63 pathways.

In addition to mental retardation, individuals with DS exhibit a large range of variable traits, including co-occurring congenital malformations. It is now clear that neurogenesis impairment underlies the typically reduced brain size and, hence, mental retardation in individuals with DS. The small body size and the constellation of congenital malformations in children with DS suggest that proliferation defects may involve peripheral tissues, in addition to the brain. The goal of the current study was to establish whether a generalized impairment of cell proliferation is a key feature of the trisomic condition. We used the Ts65Dn mouse, a widely used DS model, and examined proliferation in tissues with different embryological origin by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine immunohistochemistry. We found that 2-day-old (P2) Ts65Dn mice had notably fewer proliferating cells in the heart and liver, and in all proliferating niches of the skin and intestine. A reduced proliferation rate was still present in the intestine at P15. In all tissues, Ts65Dn mice had a similar number of apoptotic cells as euploid mice, indicating no unbalance in cell death. In the skin, liver and intestine of trisomic mice, we found a higher expression of patched1 (Ptch1), a receptor that represses the mitogenic sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway. This suggests that Ptch1-dependent inhibition of Shh signaling may underlie proliferation impairment in trisomic peripheral tissues. In agreement with the widespread reduction in proliferation, neonate trisomic mice had a reduced body weight and this defect was still present at 30 days of age.

To verify the role of FGF10 during eyelid closure, explant culture of Fgf10-null eyelid anlagen was performed, by which it was examined whether or not exogenous FGF10 could rescue the expression of activin betaB and transforming growth factor alpha, known to be required for eyelid closure. We found that the expression of these genes was markedly induced while that of Shh or Ptch1, Ptch2 was not. We also observed the distribution of filamentous actin (F-actin) after FGF10 application in the mutant eyelid explant, finding that the FGF10 protein induced F-actin accumulation. We further examined filopodia of the eyelid leading edge cells, finding the length of the filopodia was significantly reduced in the mutant. These results verify that FGF10 promotes eyelid closure through activating activin and TGFalpha-EGFR signaling.",

Coinciding with the period of cyclin D1-only expression, Ccnd1(-/-) mice showed reduced proliferation of GNPs and impaired growth of the cerebellum. Interestingly, removal of cyclin D1 was sufficient to drastically reduce the incidence of medulloblastoma in Ptch1(+/-) mice, despite the fact that these tumors showed upregulation of both cyclins D1 and D2. We showed that cyclin D1 has an earlier role in tumorigenesis: in the absence of cyclin D1, the incidence and overall volume of ;preneoplastic' lesions were significantly decreased.

This article is intended to review this intriguing entity and to summarize the findings of recent studies related to the nature of OKCs and their clinical and therapeutic implications. Recent advances in genetic and molecular research, i.e., PTCH1 mutations and involvement of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, have led to increased knowledge of OKC pathogenesis which hints at potential new treatment options, although the question of whether the OKC is a cyst or a cystic neoplasm is yet to be answered with certainty.

Recognizing that Hedgehog signaling is required for early esophageal development, we sought to determine if the Hedgehog pathway is reactivated in Barrett's esophagus, and if genes downstream of the pathway could promote columnar differentiation of esophageal epithelium.;Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze clinical specimens, human esophageal cell lines, and mouse esophagi. Human esophageal squamous epithelial (HET-1A) and adenocarcinoma (OE33) cells were subjected to acid treatment and used in transfection experiments. Swiss Webster mice were used in a surgical model of bile reflux injury. An in vivo transplant culture system was created using esophageal epithelium from Sonic hedgehog transgenic mice.;Marked up-regulation of Hedgehog ligand expression, which can be induced by acid or bile exposure, occurs frequently in Barrett's epithelium and is associated with stromal expression of the Hedgehog target genes PTCH1 and BMP4. BMP4 signaling induces expression of SOX9, an intestinal crypt transcription factor, which is highly expressed in Barrett's epithelium. We further show that expression of Deleted in Malignant Brain Tumors 1, the human homologue of the columnar cell factor Hensin, occurs in Barrett's epithelium and is induced by SOX9. Finally, transgenic expression of Sonic hedgehog in mouse esophageal epithelium induces expression of stromal Bmp4, epithelial Sox9, and columnar cytokeratins.;Epithelial Hedgehog ligand expression may contribute to the initiation of Barrett's esophagus through induction of stromal BMP4, which triggers reprogramming of esophageal epithelium in favor of a columnar phenotype.",

Mutated genes were correlated with clinical outcomes using Kaplan-Meier methods (PFS, OS) and logistic regression (chemo-response). RB1 protein expression was detected by either western blotting of cultured cell lysates or immunohistochemistry of tumor specimens.;In all, 39 patients had ES-SCLC; 15 patients had either primary refractory/resistant disease and 21 patients had sensitive disease. The two most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (86%) and RB1 (58%); other frequently mutated genes (>10% patients) were involved in epigenetic regulation as well as the mTOR pathway. We identified a number of low-frequency, targetable mutations, including RICTOR, FGFR1, KIT, PTCH1 and RET. Using multivariate analysis, RB1 was the only significant factor (P = 0.038) in predicting response to first-line chemotherapy, with an odds ratio of 5.58 comparing mutant RB1 with wild-type. Patients with mutant RB1 had both better OS (11.7 versus 9.1 months P = 0.04) and PFS (11.2 versus 8.6 months, P = 0.06) compared with patients with wild-type RB1. Interestingly, â¼25% of SCLC cell lines and tumor specimens expressed RB1 protein, possibly representing the subgroup with wild-type RB1.;We found that SCLC tumors harboring no mutation in RB1 had a poor response to chemotherapy.",

Here we investigate the role of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in hypoxia induced pancreatic cancer EMT and invasion.;Pancreatic cancer cells were cultured under controlled hypoxia conditions (3% O2) or normoxic conditions. HIF-1Î± siRNA, cyclopamine (a SMO antagonist) and GLI1 siRNA were used to inhibit HIF-1Î± transcription or Hh signaling activation. The effect of hypoxia and Hh signaling on cancer cell EMT and invasion were evaluated by Quantitative real-time PCR analysis, Western blot analysis and invasion assay.;Here, we show that non-canonical Hh signaling is required as an important role to switch on hypoxia-induced EMT and invasion in pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, our data demonstrate hypoxia induces EMT process as well as invasion, and activates the non-canonical Hh pathway without affecting sonic hedgehog homolog (SHH) expression. Moreover, these effects are reversible upon HIF-1Î± siRNA interference with unchanged SHH and patched1 (PTCH1) level. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that hypoxia induced invasion and EMT process are effectively inhibited by Smoothened (SMO) antagonist cyclopamine and GLI1 siRNA. In addition, GLI1 interference inhibited EMT progress with significantly suppressed vimentin expression, whereas inhibition of SMO through cyclopamine could not reduce vimentin level. This data indicate that hypoxia could trigger other factors (such as TGF-Î², KRAS or RTK) bypassing SMO to activate GLI1 directly.;Our findings suggest that Hh signaling modulates hypoxia induced pancreatic cancer EMT and invasion in a ligand-independent manner.

We evaluated the Nanostring nCounterâ¢ platform for multi-marker, gene expression-based detection and classification of DTCs in the BM of breast cancer patients. Candidate genes exhibiting tumor cell-specific expression were identified from microarray datasets and validated by qRT-PCR analysis in non-malignant human BM and identical samples spiked with predefined numbers of molecularly diverse breast tumor cell lines. Thirty-eight validated transcripts were designed for the nCounterâ¢ platform and a subset of these transcripts was technically validated against qRT-PCR measurements using identical spiked BM controls. Bilateral iliac crest BM aspirates were collected and analyzed from twenty breast cancer patients, prior to neoadjuvant therapy, using the full 38-gene nCounterâ¢ code set. Tumor cell-specific gene expression by nCounterâ¢ was detected with a sensitivity of one cancer cell per 1 Ã 10(6) nucleated BM cells after optimization. Measurements were quantitative, log linear over a 20-fold range, and correlated with qRT-PCR measurements. Using the nCounterâ¢ 38-gene panel, 6 of 8 patients (75 %) who developed metastatic disease had detectable expression of at least one transcript. Notably, three of these patients had detectable expression of ERBB2 in their BM, despite the fact that their corresponding primary tumors were HER2/ERBB2 negative and therefore did not receive trastuzumab therapy. Four of these patients also expressed the PTCH1 receptor, a newly recognized therapeutic target based on hedgehog signaling pathway inhibition. The presumptive detection and classification of DTCs in the BM of breast cancer patients, based on sensitive and quantitative multi-marker detection of gene expression using the nCounterâ¢ platform, provide an opportunity to both predict early distant recurrence and, more importantly, identify opportunities for preventing the spread of disease based on the expression of unique, therapeutically actionable gene targets.

The current study examined events during the first 2 wk of life in Amhr2(cre/+)SmoM2 mice to gain insight into the cause of anovulation. Expression of transcriptional targets of HH signaling, Gli1, Ptch1, and Hhip, which are used as measures of pathway activity, were elevated during the first several days of life in Amhr2(cre/+)SmoM2 mice compared to controls but were similar to controls in older mice. Microarray analysis showed that genes with increased expression in 2-day-old mutants compared to controls were enriched for the processes of vascular and tube development and steroidogenesis. The density of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-labeled endothelial tubes was increased in the cortex of newborn ovaries of mutant mice. Costaining of preovulatory follicles for PECAM and smooth muscle actin showed that muscle-type vascular support cells are deficient in theca of mutant mice. Expression of genes for steroidogenic enzymes that are normally expressed in the fetal adrenal gland were elevated in newborn ovaries of mutant mice. In summary, overactivation of HH signaling during early life alters gene expression and vascular development and this is associated with the lifelong development of anovulatory follicles in which the thecal vasculature fails to mature appropriately.",

Many genes are known to be involved in the etiology of this disorder; however, our understanding of cleft lip pathogenesis remains incomplete. In the present study, we uncovered a role for sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling during lip fusion. Mice carrying compound mutations in hedgehog acyltransferase (Hhat) and patched1 (Ptch1) exhibited perturbations in the SHH gradient during frontonasal development, which led to hypoplastic nasal process outgrowth, epithelial seam persistence, and cleft lip. Further investigation revealed that enhanced SHH signaling restricts canonical WNT signaling in the lambdoidal region by promoting expression of genes encoding WNT inhibitors. Moreover, reduction of canonical WNT signaling perturbed p63/interferon regulatory factor 6 (p63/IRF6) signaling, resulting in increased proliferation and decreased cell death, which was followed by persistence of the epithelial seam and cleft lip. Consistent with our results, mutations in genes that disrupt SHH and WNT signaling have been identified in both mice and humans with cleft lip. Collectively, our data illustrate that altered SHH signaling contributes to the etiology and pathogenesis of cleft lip through antagonistic interactions with other gene regulatory networks, including the canonical WNT and p63/IRF6 signaling pathways.

Identifying and understanding the genetic events that drive these tumours is critical for the development of more effective diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies. Recently, our group and others described distinct molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma on the basis of transcriptional and copy number profiles. Here we use whole-exome hybrid capture and deep sequencing to identify somatic mutations across the coding regions of 92 primary medulloblastoma/normal pairs. Overall, medulloblastomas have low mutation rates consistent with other paediatric tumours, with a median of 0.35 non-silent mutations per megabase. We identified twelve genes mutated at statistically significant frequencies, including previously known mutated genes in medulloblastoma such as CTNNB1, PTCH1, MLL2, SMARCA4 and TP53. Recurrent somatic mutations were newly identified in an RNA helicase gene, DDX3X, often concurrent with CTNNB1 mutations, and in the nuclear co-repressor (N-CoR) complex genes GPS2, BCOR and LDB1. We show that mutant DDX3X potentiates transactivation of a TCF promoter and enhances cell viability in combination with mutant, but not wild-type, Î²-catenin. Together, our study reveals the alteration of WNT, hedgehog, histone methyltransferase and now N-CoR pathways across medulloblastomas and within specific subtypes of this disease, and nominates the RNA helicase DDX3X as a component of pathogenic Î²-catenin signalling in medulloblastoma.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The development of long bones requires a sophisticated spatial organization of cellular signalling, proliferation, and differentiation programs. How such spatial organization emerges on the growing long bone domain is still unresolved. Based on the reported biochemical interactions we developed a regulatory model for the core signalling factors IHH, PTCH1, and PTHrP and included two cell types, proliferating/resting chondrocytes and (pre-)hypertrophic chondrocytes. We show that the reported IHH-PTCH1 interaction gives rise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing kinetics, and that inclusion of PTHrP is important to achieve robust patterning when coupling patterning and tissue dynamics. The model reproduces relevant spatiotemporal gene expression patterns, as well as a number of relevant mutant phenotypes. In summary, we propose that a ligand-receptor based Turing mechanism may control the emergence of patterns during long bone development, with PTHrP as an important mediator to confer patterning robustness when the sensitive Turing system is coupled to the dynamics of a growing and differentiating tissue. We have previously shown that ligand-receptor based Turing mechanisms can also result from BMP-receptor, SHH-receptor, and GDNF-receptor interactions, and that these reproduce the wildtype and mutant patterns during digit formation in limbs and branching morphogenesis in lung and kidneys. Receptor-ligand interactions may thus constitute a general mechanism to generate Turing patterns in nature. ",

They are found in most mammalian species, but their number and arrangement are species-specific. Nine palatal rugae are found in the mouse secondary palate. Previous studies have shown that epithelial Shh signaling in the palatal ridge plays an important role during rugae development. Moreover, Wnt family members, including LEF1, play a functional role in orofacial morphogenesis. To explore the function of Shh during rugae development, we utilized the maternal transfer of 5E1 (anti-Shh antibody) to mouse embryos. 5E1 induced abnormal rugae patterning characterized by a spotted shape of palatal ridge rather than a stripe. The expression patterns of Shh and Shh-related genes, Sostdc1, Lef1 and Ptch1, were disrupted following 5E1 injection. Moreover, rugae-specific cell proliferation and inter-rugae-specific apoptosis were affected by inhibition of Shh signaling. We hypothesize that the altered gene expression patterns and the change in molecular events caused by the inhibition of Shh signaling may have induced abnormal rugae patterning. Furthermore, we propose a reaction-diffusion model generated by Wnt, Shh and Sostdc1 signaling. In this study, we show that Sostdc1, a secreted inhibitor of the Wnt pathway, is a downstream target of Shh and hypothesize that the interaction of Wnt, Shh and Sostdc1 is a pivotal mechanism controlling the spatial patterning of palatal rugae.",

Somatic mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes occur frequently in WHO grades II and III gliomas and WHO grade IV secondary glioblastomas. Hh pathway activation in WHO grades II and III gliomas suggests that it might also be operational in glioblastomas that developed from lower-grade lesions. To evaluate this possibility and to better define the molecular and histopathological glioma subtypes that are Hh-responsive, IDH genes were sequenced in adult glioma specimens assayed for an operant Hh pathway. The proportions of grades II-IV specimens with IDH mutations correlated with the proportions that expressed elevated levels of the Hh gene target PTCH1. Indices of an operational Hh pathway were measured in all primary cultures and xenografts derived from IDH-mutant glioma specimens, including IDH-mutant glioblastomas. In contrast, the Hh pathway was not operational in glioblastomas that lacked IDH mutation or history of antecedent lower-grade disease. IDH mutation is not required for an operant pathway however, as significant Hh pathway modulation was also measured in grade III gliomas with wild-type IDH sequences. These results indicate that the Hh pathway is operational in grades II and III gliomas and glioblastomas with molecular or histopathological evidence for evolvement from lower-grade gliomas. Lastly, these findings suggest that gliomas sharing this molecularly defined route of progression arise in Hh-responsive cell types.",

The current standard of care is visual inspection by physicians and/or dermatologists, followed by skin biopsy and pathologic confirmation. We have investigated the use of in vivo fluorescence imaging using fluorocoxib A as a molecular probe for early detection and assessment of skin tumors in mouse models of NMSC. Fluorocoxib A targets the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme that is preferentially expressed by inflamed and tumor tissue, and therefore has potential to be an effective broadly active molecular biomarker for cancer detection. We tested the sensitivity of fluorocoxib A in a BCC allograft SCID hairless mouse model using a wide-field fluorescence imaging system. Subcutaneous allografts comprised of 1000 BCC cells were detectable above background. These BCC allograft mice were imaged over time and a linear correlation (R(2) = 0.8) between tumor volume and fluorocoxib A signal levels was observed. We also tested fluorocoxib A in a genetically engineered spontaneous BCC mouse model (Ptch1(+/-) K14-Cre-ER2 p53(fl/fl)), where sequential imaging of the same animals over time demonstrated that early, microscopic lesions (100 Î¼m size) developed into visible macroscopic tumor masses over 11 to 17 days. Overall, for macroscopic tumors, the sensitivity was 88% and the specificity was 100%. For microscopic tumors, the sensitivity was 85% and specificity was 56%. These results demonstrate the potential of fluorocoxib A as an in vivo imaging agent for early detection, margin delineation and guided biopsies of NMSCs. ",

Two major isoforms of human SUFU are known, a full-length (SUFU-FL) and a carboxy-terminal truncated (SUFU- ÎC) variant. Even though SUFU- ÎC is expressed at an equivalent level as SUFU-FL in certain tissues, the function of SUFU-ÎC and its impact on HH signal transduction is still unclear. In two cell lines from rhabdomyosarcoma, a tumor type associated with deregulated HH signaling, SUFU-ÎC mRNA was expressed at comparable levels as SUFU-FL mRNA, but at the protein level only low amounts of SUFU-ÎC were detectable. Heterologous expression provided support to the notion that the SUFU-ÎC protein is less stable compared to SUFU-FL. Despite this, biochemical analysis revealed that SUFU-ÎC could repress GLI2 and GLI1ÎN, but not GLI1FL, transcriptional activity to the same extent as SUFU-FL. Moreover, under conditions of activated HH signaling SUFU-ÎC was more effective than SUFU-FL in inhibiting GLI1ÎN. Importantly, co-expression with GLI1FL indicated that SUFU-ÎC but not SUFU-FL reduced the protein levels of GLI1FL. Additionally, confocal microscopy revealed a co-localization of GLI1FL with SUFU-ÎC but not SUFU-FL in aggregate structures. Moreover, specific siRNA mediated knock-down of SUFU-ÎC resulted in up-regulation of the protein levels of GLI1FL and the HH signaling target genes PTCH1 and HHIP. Our results are therefore suggesting the presence of novel regulatory controls in the HH signaling pathway, which are elicited by the distinct mechanism of action of the two alternative spliced SUFU proteins.",

Previous studies have shown that Shh signaling plays critical roles in palate development and regulates expression of several members of the forkhead-box (Fox) family transcription factors, including Foxf1 and Foxf2, in the facial primordia. Although cleft palate has been reported in mice deficient in Foxf2, whether Foxf2 plays an intrinsic role in and how Foxf2 regulates palate development remain to be elucidated. Using Cre/loxP-mediated tissue-specific gene inactivation in mice, we show that Foxf2 is required in the neural crest-derived palatal mesenchyme for normal palatogenesis. We found that Foxf2 mutant embryos exhibit altered patterns of expression of Shh, Ptch1, and Shox2 in the developing palatal shelves. Through RNA-seq analysis, we identified over 150 genes whose expression was significantly up- or down-regulated in the palatal mesenchyme in Foxf2-/- mutant embryos in comparison with control littermates. Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the Foxf2 mutant embryos exhibit strikingly corresponding patterns of ectopic Fgf18 expression in the palatal mesenchyme and concomitant loss of Shh expression in the palatal epithelium in specific subdomains of the palatal shelves that correlate with where Foxf2, but not Foxf1, is expressed during normal palatogenesis. Furthermore, tissue specific inactivation of both Foxf1 and Foxf2 in the early neural crest cells resulted in ectopic activation of Fgf18 expression throughout the palatal mesenchyme and dramatic loss of Shh expression throughout the palatal epithelium. Addition of exogenous Fgf18 protein to cultured palatal explants inhibited Shh expression in the palatal epithelium. Together, these data reveal a novel Shh-Foxf-Fgf18-Shh circuit in the palate development molecular network, in which Foxf1 and Foxf2 regulate palatal shelf growth downstream of Shh signaling, at least in part, by repressing Fgf18 expression in the palatal mesenchyme to ensure maintenance of Shh expression in the palatal epithelium.
