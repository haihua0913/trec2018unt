        "Doc_abstract":"ABL1 amplification, due to a cryptic episomal translocation NUP214/ABL1, is a novel finding in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here we report on the incidence and clinical features of this genetic defect in a series of 30 consecutive adult T-cell ALL patients. Multiple copies of the ABL1 gene were detected in two patients (6.6%), one with the karyotype 46,XY,t(1;3)(p36;p21),del(6)(q23)/46,XY and the other without analyzable metaphases. Metaphase/interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detected multiple uncountable signals corresponding to ABL1 in mitotic cells and nuclei from both patients. In one patient, no signals corresponded with the 9p21 chromosomal region, which contains the p16INK4a gene, and in the other one signal was observed. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated that in these patients ABL1 gene expression was 14- and 18-fold greater than in normal controls, and returned to normal levels only when complete remission was achieved. We reached the following conclusions: (1) FISH is the only technique that promptly identifies T-cell ALL patients with ABL1 amplification, (2) quick identification with FISH is fundamental in the clinic because this T-cell ALL subset is imatinib sensitive but may become resistant due to development of additional mutations, and (3) ABL1 quantitative RT-PCR may be easily applied to monitor minimal residual disease.",

In K562 leukemia cells, overexpression of miR-30a reduced ABL1 and BCR-ABL1 protein expression, decreased proliferation, and arrested cell cycle progression between G1 and S.

The P190 form of BCR-ABL is rarely observed in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) but is present in 50% of Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In contrast, the P210 form is observed both in CML and 50% of Ph-positive ALL. Methylation of the proximal promoter of the ABL1 gene has been shown to be a nearly universal event associated with clinical progression of CML. This raises the question of whether methylation of the ABL1 promoter is an epigenetic modification also associated with Ph-positive ALL. To study this issue, we used methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing to determine the methylation status of the ABL1 promoter in 18 Ph-positive ALL samples. We report here that gene-specific ABL1 promoter methylation is associated mainly with the P210 form of BCR-ABL and not the P190 form. While six out of the seven P210-positive ALL samples had ABL1 promoter methylation, none of the 11 P190-positive ALL samples demonstrated ABL1 promoter methylation. In addition, we estimated the extent and relative abundance of ABL1 promoter methylation in several Ph-positive ALL samples and compared it to the methylation pattern in chronic, accelerated and blastic crisis phases of CML. We put forth a model that correlates the different types of leukemias with the different levels of ABL1 promoter methylation.",

Ligand-independent activation occurs as a consequence of point mutations or insertions/deletions within functionally relevant regulatory domains (JAK2) or the creation of TK fusion proteins by balanced reciprocal translocations, insertions or episomal amplification (ABL1 and JAK2). Specific abnormalities are correlated with clinical phenotype, although some are broad and encompass several World Health Organization-defined entities. TKs are excellent drug targets as exemplified by the activity of imatinib in BCR-ABL1-positive disease, particularly chronic myeloid leukemia. Resistance to imatinib is seen in a minority of cases and is often associated with the appearance of secondary point mutations within the TK domain of BCR-ABL1. These mutations are highly variable in their sensitivity to increased doses of imatinib or alternative TK inhibitors such as nilotinib or dasatinib.

The main BCR-ABL1 breakpoints result in P190 BCR-ABL1 or P210 BCR-ABL1 fusion proteins. The latter is found in almost all cases of CML and in one third of the cases of t(9;22)-positive adult B-ALL. P190 BCR-ABL1 is found in the remaining two thirds of t(9;22)-positive adult B-ALL cases but only exceptionally in CML. We describe here the first case of t(9;22)(q34;q11) associated with t(10;11)(p13;q14) in acute monocytic leukemia. The recurrent t(10;11)(p13;q14) translocation, usually found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and T-ALL, merges PICALM to MLLT10. RT-PCR enabled identification of PICALM-MLLT10 and BCR-ABL1 e1-a2 fusion transcripts; in the context of chronic and acute myeloid leukemia, the latter usually has a monocytic presentation. We also identified overexpression of HOXA9, a gene essential to myeloid differentiation that is expressed in PICALM-MLLT10 and MLL-rearranged acute leukemias. This case fits with and extends a recently proposed multistage AML model in which constitutive activation of tyrosine kinases by mutations (BCR-ABL1) are associated with deregulation of transcription factors central to myeloid differentiation (HOXA9 secondary to PICALM-MLLT10).",

In chronic myeloid leukemia, changes in the methylation status of the CpG-rich islands at several sites in the proximal ABL1 promoter (Pa) on the Philadelphia (Ph)-chromosome have been observed. It remains unclear if the Pa methylation precedes the translocation event (t9;22) that generates the Ph-chromosome or if Pa methylation is a stochastic event in a progenitor cell which will later acquire other mutations, namely t9;22. The present study was conducted to answer two questions: What is the methylation status of Pa in patients with Ph-negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPD)? Can the study of methylation in patients with Ph-negative MPD shed light on the initial events associated with the translocation? To probe CpG methylation, we used two methodologies; site-methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme assay and methylation-specific PCR analysis following modification of genomic DNA by bisulfite. Results showed that 22 of the 97 patients with Ph-negative MPD expressed BCR-ABL transcripts. Seven of the 97 patients possessed methylated Pa, but only 2 of them expressed BCR-ABL transcripts. In some of the patients, Pa methylation was a dynamic event. In conclusion, aberrant methylation in Ph-negative MPD could be an initial event triggering the occurrence of the t9;22 translocation and its clinical expression. These findings may shed light on the pathogenesis and progression of MPD.",

We examined the functional effects of fusion proteins and the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in mouse pre-B cells and xenografts of human Ph-like ALL.;Ph-like ALL increased in frequency from 10% among children with standard-risk ALL to 27% among young adults with ALL and was associated with a poor outcome.

Expression of ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, JAK2, and PDGFRB fusions resulted in cytokine-independent proliferation and activation of phosphorylated STAT5. Cell lines and human leukemic cells expressing ABL1, ABL2, CSF1R, and PDGFRB fusions were sensitive in vitro to dasatinib, EPOR and JAK2 rearrangements were sensitive to ruxolitinib, and the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion was sensitive to crizotinib.;Ph-like ALL was found to be characterized by a range of genomic alterations that activate a limited number of signaling pathways, all of which may be amenable to inhibition with approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

There is a constant search out of new potential therapeutic molecule to combat this disorder. In most cases, patients with FA develop haematological malignancies with acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Identifying drugs which can efficiently block the pathways of both these disorders can be an ideal and novel strategy to treat FA. The curcumin, a natural compound obtained from turmeric is an interesting therapeutic molecule as it has been reported in the literature to combat both FA as well as leukemia. However, its complete mechanism is not elucidated. Herein, a systems biology approach for elucidating the therapeutic potential of curcumin against FA and leukemia is investigated by analyzing the computational molecular interactions of curcumin ligand with FANC G of FA and seven other key disease targets of leukemia. The proteins namely DOT1L, farnesyl transferase (FDPS), histone decetylase (EP3000), Polo-like kinase (PLK-2), aurora-like kinase (AUKRB), tyrosine kinase (ABL1), and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) were chosen as disease targets for leukemia and modeled structure of FANC G protein as the disease target for FA. The docking investigations showed that curcumin had a very high binding affinity of -8.1 kcal/mol with FANC G protein. The key disease targets of leukemia namely tyrosine kinase (ABL1), aurora-like kinase (AUKRB), and polo-like kinase (PLK-2) showed that they had the comparable binding affinities of -9.7 k cal/mol, -8.7 k cal/mol, and -8.6 k cal/mol, respectively with curcumin. Further, the percentage similarity scores obtained from PAM50 using EMBOSS MATCHER was shown to provide a clue to understand the structural relationships to an extent and to predict the binding affinity. This investigation shows that curcumin effectively interacts with the disease targets of both FA and leukemia.",

Unexpectedly, B cell precursor leukemia cells harboring a BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangement do not depend on antigen receptor mediated survival signals. Genes involved in the signaling cascade of the antigen receptor are silenced and in most cases, the dominant tumor clone does not carry a functional IGH gene rearrangement. However, upon inhibition of the BCR-ABL1 kinase activity by STI571, only leukemia cells expressing an antigen receptor are able to survive. Since resistance to STI571 is frequent in the therapy of BCR-ABL1(+) B cell precursor leukemia, antigen receptor signaling may represent a mechanism through which these cells can temporarily evade STI571-induced apoptosis.

This work was also of major importance to support the idea that cytogenetic changes were drivers of leukemogenesis. John Goldman originally made seminal contributions to the use of autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation from the late 1970s onwards. Then, in collaboration with Brian Druker, he led efforts to develop ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the late 1990s. He also led the global efforts to develop and harmonize methodology for molecular monitoring, and was an indefatigable organizer of international conferences. These conferences brought together clinicians and scientists, and accelerated the adoption of new therapies. The abundance of praise, tributes and testimonies expressed by many serve to illustrate the indelible impressions these two passionate and affable scholars made on so many people's lives.

The association of primary imatinib resistance with higher transcript levels of the drug metabolism gene PTGS1 was confirmed in a separate data set of 68 newly diagnosed, imatinib-treated CML (P = .008). In contrast, up to 11 different genes were identified in a multivariate model that optimally discriminated secondary imatinib resistance lacking ABL1 kinase domain mutation from imatinib-responsive cases, likely related to the more complex pathogenesis of secondary resistance.;Gene expression profiling of CML at diagnosis for PTGS1 may be useful in predicting imatinib response and in selecting alternate therapy.",

Among them, the MLL/AFF1 (AF4/FMR2 family, member 1) fusion, associated with rearrangements between bands 4q21 and 11q23 is a recurrent event in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Gene expression profiling (GEP) was performed for four adult patients with ALL. Their signatures were compared to those of ALL patients with a fusion gene involving c-abl oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase (ABL1). The comparison of MLL-AFF1 cases with the ABL1 group identified 477 genes being differentially expressed at the statistically significant level of p<0.05, with 296 and 181 genes up- and down-regulated, respectively, in the MLL-AFF1 cases. Three GEP studies on t(4;11)(q21;q23) focusing on the age group of the patients have been reported in the literature. Different expression profiles based on the levels of the homeobox A (HOXA) signature were identified. Although comparison between studies is difficult because of differences in the microarrays and the control samples used, our results and those from the literature suggest that cells carrying t(4;11)(q21;q23) use different pathways to lead to leukemogenesis. Therefore, t(4;11)-associated ALL could represent different biological entities.",

Only a small number of RCSD1-ABL1 positive cases of B-ALL have been described in the literature, and the full spectrum of clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic, and molecular features associated with this genetic abnormality has not been defined. We describe extensive genetic characterization of a case of B-ALL with RCSD1-ABL1 fusion, by using conventional cytogenetic analysis, Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) studies, and Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA). The use of CMA resulted in detection of an approximately 70 kb deletion at 7p12.2, which caused a disruption of the IKZF1 gene. Deletions and mutations of IKZF1 are recurring abnormalities in B-ALL and are associated with a poor prognosis. Our findings highlight the association of the deletion of IKZF1 gene with the t(1;9)(q24;q34) and illustrate the importance of comprehensive cytogenetic and molecular evaluation for accurate prediction of prognosis in patients with B-cell ALL.

We used real-time PCR and ABL1 kinase domain sequencing on sequential samples from 11 patients with Philadelphia-positive leukemias who received dasatinib. We were able to detect pre-existing mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 in four patients, particularly in patients with high BCR-ABL1 transcript levels. Most mutations disappeared with dasatinib, however, in five patients a clone with T315I appeared during dasatinib treatment. We conclude that sensitive molecular monitoring with real-time PCR for BCR-ABL1 transcripts and mutation screening of the ABL1 kinase domain of patients with Philadelphia-positive leukemias are valuable for patient management, however, mutation findings should be interpreted with caution, as mutant clones not always behave in vivo as predicted by in vitro assays.",

These include PDGFRB, JAK2, NTRK3, ABL2, and ABL1, each of which encodes for proteins with tyrosine kinase activity. To date, ETV6/ABL1 transcripts have been detected in only four patients with a leukemic disorder. Here, we describe one adult with chronic myeloid leukemia and a child with T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia with ETV6/ABL1. Molecular cytogenetic analysis confirmed that formation of an ETV6/ABL1 fusion in these patients required at least three chromosomal breaks and showed that each of these translocations is the result of a complex chromosomal rearrangement. Molecular analysis showed the presence of two fusion transcripts in both patients as the result of alternative splicing, questioning the suggested role of these transcripts in the lineage specificity.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization and array-based comparative genomic hybridization were performed to characterize the rearrangement. ETV6/ABL1 fusion was demonstrated to result from insertion of a duplicated 300 to 1300 kb region of 9q34 that contained the distal portion of the ABL1 gene, into the ETV6 locus on 12p13. With this insertion, an 1150 to 1750 kb region of 12p13 that contained the distal portion of the ETV6 gene as well the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKN) 1B gene was lost. Furthermore, the cells displayed a del(9)(p21.1 approximately p23), typically associated with loss of CDKN2A and CDKN2B. The ALL-VG cell line may serve as a tool for the study of ETV6/ABL1.",

This was done in order to determine if kinase inhibitor-induced myocyte damage was a consequence of inhibiting ABL1 (on-target effects), or due to a lack of kinase selectivity (off-target effects) since previous studies have come up with conflicting conclusions about whether imatinib-induced cardiotoxicity results directly from inhibition of ABL1. The most specific and least potent inhibitors, imatinib and nilotinib, induced the least myocyte damage, while the least specific and most potent inhibitors, ponatinib and dasatinib, induced the most damage. Inhibitor-induced myocyte damage also correlated with clinically observed cardiovascular toxicity. Growth inhibition of the erythroleukemic K562 human cell line with a constitutively active BCR-ABL1 kinase was negatively correlated with inhibitor-induced myocyte damage, which suggests that inhibition of ABL1 causes myocyte damage. Myocyte damage was also negatively correlated with inhibitor dissociation binding constants and with inhibition of enzymatic ABL1 kinase activity. Myocyte damage was also positively correlated with two measures of inhibitor selectivity, which suggests that a lack of inhibitor selectivity is responsible for myocyte damage. In conclusion, myocyte damage, and thus the cardiovascular toxicity of the BCR-ABL1-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, is due to direct inhibition of ABL1 and/or their lack of inhibitor selectivity.",

Newer generation TKIs were initiated at a ≥ 50% dose reduction from the standard pretransplantation dosing to limit the toxicities and avoid therapy interruptions. TKIs were started a median of 100 days (range, 28-238 days) after transplantation and were administered for a median of 16 months (range, 8 days to 105 months). Eight patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events. With a median follow-up of 3.6 years (range, 4 months to 8.7 years), the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 61%. All 3 patients who developed a relapse underwent successful salvage treatment and remained disease-free.

This assay is based on the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in multiplex format. In a retrospective comparative clinical study performed in a reference laboratory, RNA was extracted from 48 CML patient blood samples with various BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratios and RT-qPCR was performed using either MAScIR assay or the RT-qPCR simplex reference assay used in routine clinical testing. The comparative clinical results showed high qualitative and quantitative concordance (correlation coefficient >0.95) between MAScIR and the reference assays. The present study illustrates the utility of MAScIR assay as a sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective quantitative device to monitor the BCR-ABL1 ratios by RT-qPCR on whole blood of diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia patients.

With a structure-based drug design approach we have discovered a novel inhibitor CHMFL-074, that potently inhibits both the native and a variety of clinically emerged mutants of BCR-ABL kinase. The X-ray crystal structure of CHMFL-074 in complex with ABL1 kinase (PDB ID: 5HU9) revealed a typical type II binding mode (DFG-out) but relatively rare hinge binding. Kinome wide selectivity profiling demonstrated that CHMFL-074 bore a high selectivity (S score(1) = 0.03) and potently inhibited ABL1 kinase (IC50: 24 nM) and PDGFR α/β (IC50: 71 nM and 88 nM). CHMFL-074 displayed strong anti-proliferative efficacy against BCR-ABL-driven CML cell lines such as K562 (GI50: 56 nM), MEG-01 (GI50: 18 nM) and KU812 (GI50: 57 nM). CHMFL-074 arrested cell cycle into the G0/G1 phase and induced apoptosis in the Ph+ CML cell lines. In addition, it potently inhibited the CML patient primary cell's proliferation but did not affect the normal bone marrow cells. In the CML cell K562 inoculated xenograft mouse model, oral administration of 100 mg/kg/d of CHMFL-074 achieved a tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 65% without exhibiting apparent toxicity. As a potential drug candidate for fighting CML, CHMFL-074 is under extensive preclinical safety evaluation now.",

To avoid these outcomes, several approaches are being tested in the frontline setting, including the use of higher imatinib doses or second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as nilotinib or dasatinib, the latter of which is approved only for managing patients who have imatinib therapy failure.

The single nucleotide mutation related to subtype M2 AML was detected. Meanwhile, real-time fluorescent quantitation RT-PCR was used to detect the AML1/ETO fusion gene and its correlation with prognosis after treatment. Among 96 patients, AML1-ETO fusion gene was positive in 52 cases, the positive rate was 54.17 %. The complete relief (CR) rate of AML1-ETO fusion gene positive patients was 84.62 %, and the CR rate of AML1/ETO fusion gene negative patients was 77.27 %; the CR rate of AML1-ETO positive patients was higher than that of patients without the fusion gene, however there was no statistical difference. In the analysis of recurrent gene mutation in AML-M2 patients, IDH2, ASXL1, TET2, JAK1 and JAK2 gene expressions were not significantly different before treatment and after CR, however, IDHI, JAK3, ABL1 and BCR gene expressions were significantly different. In the study of transcriptome in AML-M2 patients, high-throughput sequencing could effectively detect the difference of the gene expression before treatment and after CR.

The alternative, downstream ABL promoter (Pa), which is usually retained in this chimeric oncogene, was reported to be methylated in many CML patients, but there has been controversy as to whether this methylation is a frequent change in bone marrow (BM) in early chronic phase (CP) or only past this stage. Also, the relevance of Pa promoter methylation to BCR-ABL expression in CML is unclear. We examined methylation of the ABL Pa promoter in uncultured BM samples and in colonies derived from their hematopoietic precursor cells by bisulfite and PCR-based assays (combined bisulfite restriction analysis and methylation-specific PCR). BM from seven CP CML patients at diagnosis had about 20-60% of the copies of the ABL Pa promoter methylated. No Pa methylation was detected in normal BMs or colonies derived from them. In contrast, most colonies from CP CML patients had Pa methylation. Surprisingly, 18-49% of the CML-derived colonies with this methylation reproducibly had no detectable BCR-ABL RNA on nested reverse transcription-PCR. Furthermore, the percentage of BCR-ABL RNA-positive colonies was almost same among the colonies not displaying Pa methylation as among the colonies in which this methylation was found. We conclude that ABL Pa methylation is often an early marker of CML in hematopoietic precursors and in total mononuclear BM cells but that it is not associated with an increased frequency of BCR-ABL RNA-positive cells. This methylation might be emblematic of cancer-associated hypermethylation elsewhere in the genome with the consequent silencing of tumor suppressor genes seen in many malignancies.",

All three showed >90% mutant transcript. The first resulted from the insertion of 79 nucleotides into the ABL1 exon 8-9 junction. The inserted sequence contained a sequence from regions of intron 8, located 120 bp apart: the 35-nucleotide sequence previously described, and an additional 44-nucleotide segment downstream from 35INS. The combined 79-nucleotide insertion splice mutant showed the same protein change as 35INS (p C475YfsX11). The second splice mutation comprised an 84-nucleotide sequence from intron 7 inserted into the ABL1 exon7-8 junction, also causing a frameshift and protein truncation (p A424EfsX18). The third splice derived from a 231-nucleotide sequence from intron 4 retained in the ABL1 exon 4-5 junction adding 40 intron-encoded amino acids and leading to a frameshift and early termination (p E275LfsX41).;These findings, when combined with the data on 35INS, support the concept that loss of the C-terminus of BCR-ABL1 is associated with significant resistance to kinase inhibitors; this mechanism appears to be a major source of resistance to kinase inhibitors.",

To determine the frequency of compound mutations among chronic myeloid leukemia patients on ABL1 TKI therapy, in the present study, we examined a collection of patient samples (N = 47) with clear evidence of 2 BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations by direct sequencing. Using a cloning and sequencing method, we found that 70% (33/47) of double mutations detected by direct sequencing were compound mutations. Sequential, branching, and parallel routes to compound mutations were common. In addition, our approach revealed individual and compound mutations not detectable by direct sequencing. The frequency of clones harboring compound mutations with more than 2 missense mutations was low (10%), whereas the likelihood of silent mutations increased disproportionately with the total number of mutations per clone, suggesting a limited tolerance for BCR-ABL1 kinase domain missense mutations.

In this study, we describe the cytogenetic and molecular features of five CML patients with cryptic BCR-ABL1 fusion genes using karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism array techniques.

CML is clinically characterized by three distinct phases: chronic, accelerated, and blast phase. Blast crisis is characterized by the rapid expansion of a population of differentiation arrested blast cells (myeloid or lymphoid cells population), with secondary chromosomal abnormalities present. We report a case of myeloid blast crisis of CML resistant to imatinib mesylate and chemotherapy. By use of cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and comparative genomic hybridization methods, we identified a cluster of BCR-ABL amplification on inverted duplication of the Ph chromosome with t(3;21)(q26;q22) and increased genomic levels of the RUNX1 gene (previously AML1). The t(3;21)(q26;q22) is a recurrent chromosomal abnormality in some cases of CML blast phase and in treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia.

Our study indicated that the progenitor of CML was BCR-ABL dependent through the amplification of Ph chromosome as a mechanism of resistance to imatinib therapy.

The Philadelphia translocation, producing a BCR‑ABL hybrid oncogene, is the most common mechanism of CML development. However, in the present study, b3a2, b2a2 and ela2 fusion junctions of the breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-V-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL) gene were not detected in patients diagnosed with CML three and four years previously. RNA-Seq technology, with an average coverage of ~30‑fold, was used to detect gene fusion events in a patient with a 6-year history of CML, identified to be in the chronic phase of the disease. Using deFuse and TopHat‑fusion programs with improved filtering methods, we identified two reliable gene fusions in a blood sample obtained from the CML patient, including extremely low expression levels of the classic BCR‑ABL1 gene fusion. In addition, a novel gene fusion involving the ring finger protein 213 (RNF213)-solute carrier family 26, member 11 (SLC26A11) was identified and validated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Further bioinformatic analysis revealed that specific domains of SLC26A11 were damaged, which may affect the function of sulfate transportation of the normal gene. The present study demonstrated that, in specific cases, alternative gene fusions, besides BCR‑ABL, may be associated with the development of CML.",

Recent years have seen a shift from microarray analysis and candidate gene sequencing to next-generation sequencing. Together, these approaches have shown that many ALL subtypes are characterized by constellations of structural rearrangements, submicroscopic DNA copy number alterations, and sequence mutations, several of which have clear implications for risk stratification and targeted therapeutic intervention. Mutations in genes regulating lymphoid development are a hallmark of ALL, and alterations of the lymphoid transcription factor gene IKZF1 (IKAROS) are associated with a high risk of treatment failure in B-ALL. Approximately 20% of B-ALL cases harbor genetic alterations that activate kinase signaling that may be amenable to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including rearrangements of the cytokine receptor gene CRLF2; rearrangements of ABL1, JAK2, and PDGFRB; and mutations of JAK1 and JAK2. Whole-genome sequencing has also identified novel targets of mutation in aggressive T-lineage ALL, including hematopoietic regulators (ETV6 and RUNX1), tyrosine kinases, and epigenetic regulators. Challenges for the future are to comprehensively identify and experimentally validate all genetic alterations driving leukemogenesis and treatment failure in childhood and adult ALL and to implement genomic profiling into the clinical setting to guide risk stratification and targeted therapy.",

Single copy (sc) products ranging in length from 62 to 2,304 nucleotides [Rogan et al., 2001; Knoll and Rogan, 2004] from ABL1 (chromosome 9q34), TEKT3 (17p12), PMP22 (17p12), and HOXB1 (17q21) were conjugated to spectrally distinct polystyrene microspheres. These conjugated probes were used in multiplex hybridization to detect homologous target sequences in biotinylated genomic DNA extracted from fixed cell pellets obtained for cytogenetic studies. Hybridized targets were bound to phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin; then the spectral emissions of both target and conjugated microsphere were codetected by flow cytometry. Prior amplification of locus-specific target DNA was not required because sc probes provide adequate specificity and sensitivity for accurate copy number determination. Copy number differences were distinguishable by comparing the mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) of test probes with a biallelic reference probe in genomic DNA of patient samples and abnormal cell lines. Concerted 5' ABL1 deletions in patient samples with a chromosome 9;22 translocation and chronic myelogenous leukemia were confirmed by comparison of the mean fluorescence intensities of ABL1 test probes with a HOXB1 reference probe. The relative intensities of the ABL1 probes were reduced to 0.59+/-0.02 fold in three different deletion patients and increased 1.42+/-0.01 fold in three trisomic 9 cell lines. TEKT3 and PMP22 probes detected proportionate copy number increases in five patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 1a disease and chromosome 17p12 duplications. Thus, the assay is capable of distinguishing one allele and three alleles from a biallelic reference sequence, regardless of chromosomal context.",

It accounts for approximately 15% of newly diagnosed cases of leukemia in adults.;CML is characterized by a balanced genetic translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), involving a fusion of the Abelson gene (ABL1) from chromosome 9q34 with the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22q11.2. This rearrangement is known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The molecular consequence of this translocation is the generation of a BCR-ABL1 fusion oncogene, which in turn translates into a BCR-ABL oncoprotein. Frontline therapy: Three tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for first-line treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase (CML-CP). Clinical trials with 2nd generation TKIs reported significantly deeper and faster responses; their impact on long-term survival remains to be determined. Salvage therapy: For patients who fail frontline therapy, second-line options include second and third generation TKIs. Although second and third generation TKIs are potent and selective TKIs, they exhibit unique pharmacological profiles and response patterns relative to different patient and disease characteristics, such as patients' comorbidities, disease stage, and BCR-ABL1 mutational status. Patients who develop the T315I \"gatekeeper\" mutation display resistance to all currently available TKIs except ponatinib. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains an important therapeutic option for patients with CML-CP who have failed at least two TKIs, and for all patients in advanced phase disease.",

In hematological cancers, the relevance of ongoing DNA damage and the mechanisms by which apoptosis is suppressed are largely unknown. We found pervasive DNA damage in hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma, lymphoma and leukemia, which leads to activation of a p53-independent, proapoptotic network centered on nuclear relocalization of ABL1 kinase. Although nuclear ABL1 triggers cell death through its interaction with the Hippo pathway coactivator YAP1 in normal cells, we show that low YAP1 levels prevent nuclear ABL1-induced apoptosis in these hematologic malignancies. YAP1 is under the control of a serine-threonine kinase, STK4. Notably, genetic inactivation of STK4 restores YAP1 levels, triggering cell death in vitro and in vivo. Our data therefore identify a new synthetic-lethal strategy to selectively target cancer cells presenting with endogenous DNA damage and low YAP1 levels. ",

JAK2 mutations, such as the common V617F substitution and the less common exon 12 mutations, are frequently detected in such tumor cells and have been incorporated into the diagnostic criteria published by the World Health Organization since 2008. However, the mechanism by which these mutations contribute to MPN development is poorly understood. We examined gene expression profiles of MPN patients focusing on genes in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway using low-density real-time PCR arrays. We identified the following 2 upregulated genes in MPN patients: a known target of the JAK-STAT axis, SOCS3, and a potentially novel target, SPI1, encoding PU.1. Induction of PU.1 expression by JAK2 V617F in JAK2-wildtype K562 cells and its downregulation by JAK2 siRNA transfection in JAK2 V617F-positive HEL cells supported this possibility. We also found that the ABL1 kinase inhibitor imatinib was very effective in suppressing PU.1 expression in BCR-ABL1-positive K562 cells but not in HEL cells. This suggests that PU.1 expression is regulated by both JAK2 and ABL1. The contribution of the two kinases in driving PU.1 expression was dominant for JAK2 and ABL1 in HEL and K562 cells, respectively. Therefore, PU.1 may be a common transcription factor upregulated in MPN. PU.1 is a transcription factor required for myeloid differentiation and is implicated in erythroid leukemia. Therefore, expression of PU.1 downstream of activated JAK2 may explain why JAK2 mutations are frequently observed in MPN patients.",

An improved topologic fit to the ABL1 protein-binding surface contributes to its increased potency over imatinib. This higher selectivity in vitro translated to an improved tolerability in vivo. In fact, nilotinib therapy in the frontline phase III ENESTnd (Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials-Newly Diagnosed Patients) study was associated with an improved toxicity profile compared with that of imatinib.

We performed genome-wide analyses of copy number aberrations in 12 T-LBL and 7 precursor B-cell LBL pediatric cases using high-resolution SNP-based array CGH. Similar to what previously has been found in T-ALL, T-LBL exhibited recurrent deletions of the CDKN2A locus, occurring in 92% of the cases. Additionally, we detected deletions of RB1 (16%), duplications of MYB (16%), and an amplification of ABL1 in one case. These results show that, similar to T-ALL, the genomic alterations in T-LBL predominantly target genes involved in cell cycle progression. The majority of precursor B-cell LBL was characterized by high-hyperdiploidy (71%), and showed high resemblance with high-hyperdiploid precursor B-cell ALL. Taken together, our data suggest that pediatric LBL and ALL exhibit similar genomic abnormalities within confined immunophenotypic and cytogenetic subgroups, but that the representations of these subgroups differs between the two entities.",

More than 95 % of BCR-ABL1 transcripts in CML are either e13a2 or e14a2 (major breakpoint cluster region or M-bcr), whereas rare BCR-ABL1 transcripts are occasionally observed, accounting for less than 1 % of CML cases. Among these, a very rare fusion transcript joining the first 6 exons of BCR to exon 2 of ABL1 (e6a2) has been reported in various hematological malignancies characterized by an aggressive clinical course. We report a new case of blast crisis (BC) CML with an e6a2 fusion transcript characterized by many eosinophil precursors with abnormal granules. Moreover, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed genomic deletions of 1.3 megabases and 342 kilobases on der(9) of chromosome 9 and 22 sequences, respectively. The fusion transcript was quantified at diagnosis and during follow-up using digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) technology. The patient was treated with Dasatinib (140 mg/day), resulting in a 3-log reduction of the e6a2 transcript molecular burden from the third month after treatment. In this twentieth e6a2 case, characterized by marked eosinophilic dysplasia, deletions on der(9), and responsive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapy, we demonstrate that for molecular response monitoring of rare fusion transcripts associated with CML, ddPCR is a very useful technology.",

In contrast to the more common oncogenic ABL1 fusion BCR-ABL1, NUP214-ABL1 localizes to the nuclear pore complexes and has attenuated transforming properties in hematopoietic cells and in mouse bone marrow transplant models. We have performed a thorough biochemical comparative analysis of NUP214-ABL1 and BCR-ABL1 and show that, despite their common tyrosine kinase domain, the two fusion proteins differ in many critical catalytic properties. NUP214-ABL1 has lower in vitro tyrosine kinase activity, which is in agreement with the absence of phosphorylation on its activation loop. NUP214-ABL1 was more sensitive to imatinib (Glivec) than BCR-ABL1 in vitro and in cells, indicating a different activation state and conformation of the two ABL1 fusion kinases. Using a peptide array, we identified differences in the spectrum and efficiency of substrate peptide phosphorylation and a differential involvement of Src kinases in downstream signaling. These results clearly indicate that different fusion partners of the same kinase can determine not only localization, but also critical functional properties of the enzyme such as inhibitor sensitivity and substrate preference, with subsequent differences in downstream signaling effectors and likely consequences in disease pathogenesis.",

Here, we describe a novel multiplex assay system based on the proven TaqMan and Armored RNA technologies and optimized for sensitive detection of three BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts and ABL1 in a single reaction. Analytical experiments confirmed the absence of significant competition between the simultaneous amplification reactions and established the sensitivity, linearity and precision of the assay. Comparative studies with 115 clinical specimens resulted in high qualitative and quantitative agreement with independent singleplex laboratory-developed tests routinely used in clinical testing. Direct comparison with a reference laboratory calibrated to the international scale (IS) demonstrated minimal analytical bias between methods and an overall accuracy and precision within the performance range required for quantitative measurement of BCR-ABL1 on the IS. We conclude that detection of e1a2, b2a2, b3a2 and ABL1 can be achieved in a multiplex assay format compatible with IS reporting. Further clinical validation of the assay could improve the operational efficiency of clinical laboratories, increase their adherence to current recommendations for b2a2/b3a2 reporting on the IS and provide for the first time an opportunity to standardize e1a2-monitoring results.",

The predictive power of these genes was validated by transcript profiling in diagnostic bone marrow samples from Ph+ ALL patients using a quantitative real-time PCR array. Gene expression was correlated with cytogenetic and molecular characteristics, including presence of ABL1 mutations and IKZF1 deletion. A total of 43 de novo Ph+ ALL patients treated uniformly with tyrosine kinase inhibitors combined with chemotherapy were selected to validate 46 identified genes. A 9-gene signature was established to distinguish optimal responders from patients with persistent residual disease and early molecular recurrence. The signature was subsequently validated with 87% predictive accuracy in an independent validation set of patients. When initially optimal responders relapsed, their gene expression patterns also shifted. Optimal responders showed upregulation of genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis pathways, whereas poor responders had higher expression of genes that facilitate tumor cell survival in hypoxic conditions as well as development of drug resistance. This unique 9-gene signature may better enable stratification of patients to proper therapeutic regimens and provides new insights into mechanisms of Ph+ ALL response to therapy.",

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is associated with constitutive ABL kinase activation resulting from fusion between parts of the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) and ABL1 genes. Similarly, fusion of the ETV6 (Tel) and ARG genes drives some forms of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of CML by inhibiting ABL, and while it also inhibits ARG, there is currently no structure of ARG in complex with dasatinib. Here, the co-crystal structure of the mouse ARG catalytic domain with dasatinib at 2.5 Å resolution is reported. Dasatinib-bound ARG is found in the DFG-in conformation although it is nonphosphorylated on the activation-loop tyrosine. In this structure the glycine-rich P-loop is found in a relatively open conformation compared with other known ABL family-inhibitor complex structures. ",

The prognostic significance of such additional chromosomal abnormalities has been controversial. Translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) CCND1-IGH is typically associated with mantle cell lymphoma or a subset of plasma cell myeloma and is exceedingly rare in myeloid neoplasm. Here we report a unique case describing a patient found at diagnosis of chronic phase CML to have both the Philadelphia chromosome as well as t(11;14)-a rare cytogenetic combination. The patient was treated with imatinib with appropriate hematologic response but persistent disease by FISH and RT-PCR. She was switched to dasatinib and eventually achieved cytogenetic remission in both translocations, but still with persistent RT-PCR evidence of BCR-ABL1 fusion. As cyclin D1 is a regulatory subunit of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 and is required for the cells to progress through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, overexpression of cyclin D1 will likely promote cells into cell cycle. This may further augment proliferation in addition to upregulated ABL1 kinase activity in the index case. It may also contribute to the resistance to imatinib, as imatinib only targets on BCR-ABL fusion. Therefore, the addition of t(11;14)(q13;q32) may have significant implication in patient management.",

The BCR-ABL1 breakpoint was sequenced after isolation by nested short-range PCR of DNA from blood, marrow, and cells on slides, obtained either at diagnosis or during treatment, or from artificial mixtures.

The limit of detection of DNA qPCR depended on the amount of DNA assayed, being 10(-5.8) when 5 μg was assayed and 10(-7.0) when 80 μg was assayed.

Imatinib also has efficacy against various pathogens, including pathogenic mycobacteria, where it decreases bacterial load in mice, albeit at doses below those used for treating cancer. We report that imatinib at such low doses unexpectedly induces differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors in the bone marrow, augments myelopoiesis but not lymphopoiesis, and increases numbers of myeloid cells in blood and spleen. Whereas progenitor differentiation relies on partial inhibition of c-Kit by imatinib, lineage commitment depends upon inhibition of other PTKs. Thus, imatinib mimics \"emergency hematopoiesis,\" a physiological innate immune response to infection. Increasing neutrophil numbers by adoptive transfer sufficed to reduce mycobacterial load, and imatinib reduced bacterial load of Franciscella spp., which do not utilize imatinib-sensitive PTKs for pathogenesis. Thus, potentiation of the immune response by imatinib at low doses may facilitate clearance of diverse microbial pathogens. ",

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib, have markedly altered the treatment of CML. However, tyrosine kinase inhibitors are associated with side effects on bone metabolism, in adult and pediatric patients. Vitamin D3 is involved in the complex cycle of bone remodeling, therefore the present study aimed to investigate the influence of imatinib on vitamin D3 metabolism in the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line, using commercially available enzyme assays. Imatinib was shown to significantly reduce the production of calcidiol and calcitriol. Based on interaction studies of imatinib with the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inhibitors VID400 and ketoconazole, it is proposed that imatinib may interfere with the vitamin D3 cascade due to its metabolism by CYP27B1, which is involved in vitamin D3 metabolism.",

Inspired by the chemical structure of S (-)-oleocanthal, a natural secoiridoid from extra-virgin olive oil with documented anticancer activity against c-Met-dependent malignancies, the research presented herein reports on the discovery of the novel olive-derived homovanillyl sinapate (HVS) as a promising c-Met inhibitor. HVS was distinguished for its remarkable potency against wild-type c-Met and its oncogenic variant in cell-free assays and confirmed by in silico docking studies. Furthermore, HVS substantially impaired the c-Met-mediated growth across a broad spectrum of breast cancer cells, while similar treatment doses had no effect on the non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell growth. In addition, HVS caused a dose-dependent inhibition of HGF-induced, but not epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced, cell scattering in addition to HGF-mediated migration, invasion, and 3-dimensional (3D) proliferation of tumor cell spheroids. HVS treatment effects were mediated via inhibition of ligand-mediated c-Met activation and its downstream mitogenic signaling and blocking molecular mediators involved in cellular motility across different cellular contexts. An interesting feature of HVS is its good selectivity for c-Met and Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL1) when profiled against a panel of kinases. Docking studies revealed interactions likely to impart high dual affinity for both ABL1 and c-Met kinases. HVS markedly reduced tumor growth, showed excellent pharmacodynamics, and suppressed cell proliferation and microvessel density in an orthotopic model of triple negative breast cancer. Collectively, the present findings suggested that the oleocanthal-based HVS is a promising c-Met inhibitor lead entity with excellent therapeutic potential to control malignancies with aberrant c-Met activity.

An extensive search for molecules to block the aberrant BCR-ABL1 protein resulted in the development of IM as an orally bioavailable agent with remarkable efficacy in producing hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular remissions. However, follow-up of patients treated with IM has demonstrated that some patients can develop resistance to IM with progression of their leukemia. Multiple mechanisms of resistance have been identified. The dominant mechanism appears to be mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1, which result in altered affinity of IM for the BCR-ABL1 protein. Recently, small-molecule, combined SRC and ABL1 inhibitors have been developed and entered into clinical trials. These inhibitors appear effective in inhibiting most of the mutant BCR-ABL1 molecules that are resistant to IM.

Analysis of CML patients resistant to BCR-ABL suppression by Imatinib mesylate coupled with the crystallographic structure of ABL complexed to this inhibitor have shown how structural mutations in ABL can circumvent an otherwise potent anticancer drug.

The first case was a 27 years old man with CML. Molecular studies (RT-PCR) revealed the rearrangement in the major-BCR region and expression of chimeric BCR/ABL mRNA of b3a2 configuration. By classical cytogenetic studies (G-banding) karyotype 46,XY was found in short-term cultivated bone marrow cells and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulated peripheral lymphocytes. FISH studies revealed the BCR/ABL fusion signals on both chromosomes 9 and green BCR signals on both chromosomes 22 in all mitoses studied. Detection of the alleles of ABL1 intragenic STR locus by fluorescence PCR followed by fragmentation analysis in the patient and his parents provided no information about transmission of the ABL gene. Quantitative assessment of BCR/ABL transcript level by RT-PCR showed 60 and 70% BCR/ABL positivity in two peripheral blood samples at 6,5 and 10,5 months after diagnosis, respectively, which does not correspond to the expression from two identical BCR/ABL hybrid genes. Therefore, the possible mechanism of the origin of two BCR/ABL fusion signals present on both chromosomes 9 could not be resolved and remains speculative. The second case was a 53 years old male with diagnosis of chronic phase of CML, with first sign of acceleration one month after diagnosis and death because of sepsis in blastic phase within four months. The cytogenetic findings were identical to those in case No. 1., i.e. karyotype 46, XY by G-banding, two BCR/ABL fusion signals on both chromosomes 9 and RT-PCR molecular studies proved b3a2 breakpoints. It is generally accepted that prognosis of the patients with fused BCR/ABL gene located on chromosome 9 is poor. The presence of two fused genes could be anticipated as two Ph chromosomes in accelerated and blastic phases of the disease. However, in our study, quantitative findings of BCR/ABL transcripts did not corresponded to the expression of two BCR/ABL genes originating from duplication.

We retrospectively collected BCR-ABL1 transcript data at different time points, events, and survival data of patients with CML treated at the Division of Hematology, San Luigi Hospital, University of Turin, Turin, Italy. Of 71 patients diagnosed from January 2005 to March 2015 in our center and treated with front-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib), we selected those who had undergone a molecular evaluation at 3 months. The event-free survival (EFS) by the median follow-up time was the primary endpoint. The data from 50 patients with CML chronic phase were analyzed. Overall, 34 of the 50 patients (68%) had a transcript ≤ 10% at 3 months. Of those in the > 10% group, 63% had experienced an event compared with 12% in the ≤ 10% group by the median follow-up point (P < .001). The halving time threshold for discriminating between EFS was 17 days. None of the patients with a transcript > 10% at 3 months had a halving time of ≤ 17 days. Patients with BCR-ABL1 ≤ 10% and a halving time of ≤ 17 days had significantly better EFS than that of patients with BCR-ABL1 ≤ 10% and a halving time > 17 days and of patients with BCR-ABL1 > 10% (96% group 1 vs. 60% group 2 vs. 27% group 3; P < .001). Irrespective of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor used, the prognosis was significantly superior for patients with BCR-ABL1 ≤ 10% and halving time of ≤ 17 days.

Dual color, dual fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH) patterns are instrumental in identifying the genesis of these CT, but their prognostic implications remain controversial. The most common mechanism is a two-step process in which a standard two-way translocation (9;22) is followed by subsequent rearrangements involving other chromosomes. The second common mechanism is the one-step process wherein breakage occurs simultaneously on different chromosomes leading to CT. The typical D-FISH pattern seen with the one-step mechanism is 1F2G2R, while the pattern for the two-step mechanism can be variable (2F1G1R, 1F1G1R, 1F1G2R, 1F2G1R, etc.).

The transposon-based Sleeping Beauty system presented offers several advantages over lentiviral transduction including the absence of biosafety issues, faster generation of transgenic cell lines, and greater efficacy in introducing large gene constructs. Nevertheless, both methods can mediate multiple insertions in the genome. Here we show that multiple BCR-ABL1 insertions result in elevated IC50 levels for individual TKIs, thus overestimating the actual resistance of mutant subclones. We have therefore established flow-sorting-based fractionation of BCR-ABL1-transformed Ba/F3 cells facilitating efficient enrichment of cells carrying single-site insertions, as demonstrated by FISH-analysis. Fractions of unselected Ba/F3 cells not only showed a greater number of BCR-ABL1 hybridization signals, but also revealed higher IC50 values for the TKIs tested.

Using cancer cell line profiling data sets, we constructed a functional classification across 107 cancer cell models, based on their common and unique target addiction signatures. The pan-cancer addiction correlations could not be explained by the tissue of origin, and only correlated in part with molecular and genomic signatures of the heterogeneous cancer cells. The TAS-based cancer cell classification was also shown to be robust to drug response data resampling, as well as predictive of the transcriptomic patterns in an independent set of cancer cells that shared similar addiction signatures with the 107 cancers. The critical protein targets identified by the integrated approach were also shown to have clinically relevant mutation frequencies in patients with various cancer subtypes, including not only well-established pan-cancer genes, such as PTEN tumor suppressor, but also a number of targets that are less frequently mutated in specific cancer types, including ABL1 oncoprotein in acute myeloid leukemia. An application to leukemia patient primary cell models demonstrated how the target deconvolution approach offers functional insights into patient-specific addiction patterns, such as those indicative of their receptor-type tyrosine-protein kinase FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) status and co-addiction partners, which may lead to clinically actionable, personalized drug treatment developments.

        "Doc_abstract":"The recent advent of whole exon (exome)-capture technology, coupled with second-generation sequencers, has made it possible to readily detect genomic alterations that affect encoded proteins in cancer cells. Such target resequencing of the cancer genome, however, fails to detect most clinically-relevant gene fusions, given that such oncogenic fusion genes are often generated through intron-to-intron ligation. To develop a resequencing platform that simultaneously captures point mutations, insertions-deletions (indels), and gene fusions in the cancer genome, we chose cDNA as the input for target capture and extensive resequencing, and we describe the versatility of such a cDNA-capture system. As a test case, we constructed a custom target-capture system for 913 cancer-related genes, and we purified cDNA fragments for the target gene set from five cell lines of CML. Our target gene set included Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL1), but it did not include breakpoint cluster region (BCR); however, the sequence output faithfully detected reads spanning the fusion points of these two genes in all cell lines, confirming the ability of cDNA capture to detect gene fusions. Furthermore, computational analysis of the sequence dataset successfully identified non-synonymous mutations and indels, including those of tumor protein p53 (TP53). Our data might thus support the feasibility of a cDNA-capture system coupled with massively parallel sequencing as a simple platform for the detection of a variety of anomalies in protein-coding genes among hundreds of cancer specimens.",

        "Doc_abstract":"To screen candidate molecules that might be useful as diagnostic biomarkers or for development of novel molecular-targeting therapies, we previously carried out gene-expression profile analysis of 101 lung carcinomas and detected an elevated expression of FGFR1OP (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 oncogene partner) in the majority of lung cancers. Immunohistochemical staining using tumor tissue microarrays consisting of 372 archived non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens revealed positive staining of FGFR1OP in 334 (89.8%) of 372 NSCLCs. We also found that the high level of FGFR1OP expression was significantly associated with shorter tumor-specific survival times (P < 0.0001 by log-rank test). Moreover, multivariate analysis determined that FGFR1OP was an independent prognostic factor for surgically treated NSCLC patients (P < 0.0001). Treatment of lung cancer cells, in which endogenous FGFR1OP was overexpressed, using FGFR1OP siRNA, suppressed its expression and resulted in inhibition of the cell growth. Furthermore, induction of FGFR1OP increased the cellular motility and growth-promoting activity of mammalian cells. To investigate its function, we searched for FGFR1OP-interacting proteins in lung cancer cells and identified ABL1 (Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1) and WRNIP1 (Werner helicase interacting protein 1), which was known to be involved in cell cycle progression. FGFR1OP significantly reduced ABL1-dependent phosphorylation of WRNIP1 and resulted in the promotion of cell cycle progression. Because our data imply that FGFR1OP is likely to play a significant role in lung cancer growth and progression, FGFR1OP should be useful as a prognostic biomarker and probably as a therapeutic target for lung cancer.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) occurs due to t(9,22) (q34;q11) and molecularly BCR/ABL gene fusion. About 15-18% Philadelphia positive CML patients have gene deletions around the translocation breakpoints on 9q34.1. The microRNAs (miRNAs), namely miR-219-2 and miR-199b, centromeric to the ABL1 gene are frequently lost in CML patients. We have designed a study to determine miR-219-2 and miR-199b expression levels which would help to understand the prognosis of imatinib therapy. A total of 150 CML patients were analyzed to identify 9q deletion. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using BCR/ABL dual color, dual fusion probe to study the signal pattern and BAC probes for miR-199b and miR-219-2 (RP11-339B21 and RP11-395P17) to study the miRNA deletions. The expression level of miRNA was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). FISH analysis revealed 9q34.1 deletion in 34 (23%) CML patients. The deletions were not detected using BAC probes for miRNAs in 9q deleted patients. The expression analysis showed down-regulation of miR-199b and miR-219-2 in the 9q deleted patients (34 CML) as compared to a pool of patients without deletion. However, miR-199b (9q34.11) was significantly (p=0.001) down-regulated compared to miR-219-2. The follow-up study showed that the miR-199b was found to be strongly associated with imatinib resistance, as 44.11% patients showed resistance to imatinib therapy. Hence, the deletion in 9q34.1 region (ABL) plays an important role in disease pathogenesis. Eventually, miRNAs can provide new therapeutic strategies and can be used as a prognostic indicator.",

Protein tyrosine kinase abnormalities, including translocations or mutations involving ABL1, JAK2, MPL, KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and FGFR1, have been used as the basis for classifying myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Two new entities - refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia and refractory cytopenia of childhood have been added to the group of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and 'refractory anemia with excess blasts-1' has been redefined to emphasize the prognostic significance of increased blasts in the peripheral blood. A list of cytogenetic abnormalities has been introduced as presumptive evidence of MDS in cases with refractory cytopenia but without morphologic evidence of dysplasia. The subgroup 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with recurrent genetic abnormalities' has been expanded to include more molecular genetic aberrations. The entity 'AML with multilineage dysplasia' specified in the 2001 WHO classification has been renamed 'AML with myelodysplasia-related changes' to include not only cases with significant multilineage dysplasia but also patients with a history of MDS or myelodysplasia-related cytogenetic abnormalities. The term 'therapy-related myeloid neoplasms' is used to cover the spectrum of disorders previously known as t-AML, t-MDS, or t-MDS/MPN occurring as complications of cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. In this review, we summarize many of these important changes and discuss some of the diagnostic challenges that remain.",
