        "Doc_abstract":"Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a prognostic factor for patients with stage IV melanoma. To gain insights into the biology underlying this prognostic factor, we analyzed total serum LDH, serum LDH isoenzymes, and serum lactate in up to 49 patients with metastatic melanoma. Our data demonstrate that high serum LDH is associated with a significant increase in LDH isoenzymes 3 and 4, and a decrease in LDH isoenzymes 1 and 2. Since LDH isoenzymes play a role in both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), we subsequently determined using tissue microarray (TMA) analysis that the levels of proteins associated with mitochondrial function, lactate metabolism, and regulators of glycolysis were all elevated in advanced melanomas compared with nevic melanocytes. To investigate whether in advanced melanoma, the glycolysis and OXPHOS pathways might be linked, we determined expression of the monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) 1 and 4. Analysis of a nevus-to-melanoma progression TMA revealed that MCT4, and to a lesser extend MCT1, were elevated with progression to advanced melanoma. Further analysis of human melanoma specimens using the Seahorse XF24 extracellular flux analyzer indicated that metastatic melanoma tumors derived a large fraction of energy from OXPHOS. Taken together, these findings suggest that in stage IV melanomas with normal serum LDH, glycolysis and OXPHOS may provide metabolic symbiosis within the same tumor, whereas in stage IV melanomas with high serum LDH glycolysis is the principle source of energy.",

The association of LDH and the OS of melanoma was estimated by hazard ratio (HR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI).;A total of 13 eligible studies with 4036 patients met the inclusion criteria.

LDH was defined as the most important serum parameter in disseminated melanoma. The aim of the present study was to compare the prognostic values of serum 5-S-Cysteinyldopa, S-100B and LDH concentrations in Stage III-IV melanoma patients. Serum samples were taken from 179 Stage III-IV melanoma patients at diagnosis. Serum 5-S-CD concentrations were determined by HPLC, S-100B protein by immunoluminometric assay while LDH by UV kinetic method. The mean/median concentrations of LDH, S-100B protein and 5-S-CD in Stage III patients ranged around the normal level. In Stage IV, the markers ranked as S100B = 5-S-CD > LDH for sensitivity, S-100B > LDH > 5-S-CD for specificity and LDH = S100B = 5-S-CD for positive predictive value, respectively. Furthermore, mean marker concentrations of patients with progressive disease differed significantly from nonprogresssive cases (when staging categories have been disregarded). Survival analysis indicated, that the initially elevated LDH and S-100B level in Stage IV disease predicts comparably short survival. Results of our study suggest that these serum marker values correlate well with Stages and disease progression. In Stage IV melanoma, the markers had appropriate sensitivity, high specificity as well as important positive predictive value. Among the studied serum markers S-100B protein and LDH proved to be similarly reliable in respect to the clinical outcome.",

The prognostic impact of serum YKL-40 in metastatic melanoma was evaluated.;YKL-40 was measured in serial serum samples from 110 patients with metastatic melanoma obtained immediately before and during treatment and from 245 healthy subjects.;Patients had higher serum YKL-40 values than healthy subjects (P < 0.001).

Several serum biomarkers appear to hold significant potential both as prognostic indicators and as targets for future therapeutic agents. The application of these markers in clinical practice possibly holds the key to significant advances in melanoma. This review summarizes the principal characteristics of serum markers of melanoma.

Lactate dehydrogenase was compared to the acute phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP), which we observed to reflect the course of melanoma metastasis in a previous report. In this prospective study, we measured LDH and CRP in the serum of 91 consecutive melanoma patients progressing into AJCC stage IV in comparison to 125 patients staying in AJCC stages I, II or III. Comparing distributions of the parameters by median values and quartiles by Mann-Whitney test, LDH was not significantly elevated in patients entering AJCC stage IV melanoma (P=0.785), whereas CRP was (P<0.001). Analysing the sensitivity and the specificity jointly by the areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (ROC-AUC), LDH did not discriminate between the defined groups of patients (AUC=0.491; 95% confidence interval, 0.410, 0.581), whereas CRP did (AUC=0.933; 95% confidence interval, 0.900, 0.966; P<0.001). Upon logistic regression analysis to calculate the ROC-AUC values upon the predictive probabilities, LDH provided no additional information to CRP. Choosing a cutoff point of 3.0 mg l(-1), CRP yielded a sensitivity of 0.769 together with a specificity of 0.904 in diagnosing AJCC stage IV entry.

Median survival in the melanoma-specific GPA classes was 3.1, 3.7, 7.5, and 12.7 months. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and serum lactatdehydrogenase (LDH) level significantly predicted survival.;In order to select the right patient to the right treatment and avoid overtreatment and suboptimal resource utilization in patients with very limited survival, improved prognostic tools are needed. The melanoma-specific GPA does not include extracranial disease extent or surrogate markers such as LDH. We suggest that a combination of KPS <70 and elevated LDH might better predict short survival than any of the GPA scores. This hypothesis should be confirmed in larger studies.",

A multivariate prognostic model was developed using the Cox regression model fitted to the data of 113 consecutive metastatic patients treated with ipilimumab (3 mg/kg, q3w) at Veneto Institute of Oncology (IOV). External validation was obtained using the data of 69 and 34 patients treated at European Oncology Institute (IEO) and University of Torino (UT), respectively.;Median survival was 8.3, 4.9 and 7.1 months from first ipilimumab administration at IOV, IEO and UT, respectively. Both higher baseline levels of LDH (Hazard Ratio [HR] v=1.36, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.16-1.58, P<.001) and neutrophils (HR=1.76, 95% CI 1.41-2.10, P<.001) were associated with worse prognosis. Model performance was satisfactory both upon internal validation (Dxy=0.42) and external validation (Dxy=0.40). Serum LDH and neutrophil count discriminated patients who lived more (low neutrophils and low LDH) or less (high LDH or neutrophils) than 24 months.;Serum LDH and neutrophil count were significant independent prognostic factors. This externally validated prognostic nomogram, could help clinicians to identify the patients who would benefit most from ipilimumab and consequently to improve resource allocation.

Follow-up examinations were performed every 3 months and blood samples were drawn to determine the levels of these tumor markers.;Metastasis occurred in 41 of the 296 patients during a median follow-up period of 19 months (range, 1-33 months). The sensitivity to detect new metastases was 29% for protein S-100beta, 22% for MIA, 2% for LDH, 17% for AP, and 24% for RT-PCR. The diagnostic accuracy was best for MIA (86%) and S-100beta (84%), whereas AP (79%), LDH (77%), and RT-PCR (72%) demonstrated lower values. Elevated values of S-100beta and MIA during follow-up examinations were associated with decreased survival rates in the further course of the disease, but pathologic findings of the other tumor markers showed no prognostic impact.;To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of currently available tumor markers in the follow-up of high-risk melanoma patients. Protein S-100beta and MIA demonstrated a higher sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of newly occurring metastasis compared with to the tumor markers AP, LDH, and RT-PCR diagnostics.

In this paper, a review of the serum biomarkers for melanoma will be detailed and will be discussed from the point of view of their practical usefulness. The expression of biomarkers can be detected intracellularly or on the cell membrane of melanoma cells or noncancer cells in association with the melanoma. Some of these molecules can then be released extracellularly and be found in body fluids such as the serum. Actually, with the emergence of new targeted therapies for cancer and the increasing range of therapeutic options, the challenge for the clinician is to assess the unique risk/response ratio and the prognosis for each patient. New serum biomarkers of melanoma progression and metastatic disease are still awaited in order to provide efficient rationale for followup and treatment choices. LDH as well as S100B levels have been correlated with poor prognosis in AJCC stage III/IV melanoma patients. However, the poor sensitivity and specificity of those markers and many other molecules are serious limitations for their routine use in both early (AJCC stage I and II) and advanced stages of melanoma (AJCC stage III and IV).

Cancer cells have metabolic flexibility in choosing either oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) or glycolysis for ATP generation depending upon the nutrient availability in tumor microenvironment. In this study, we investigated the involvement of respiratory complex I and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in melanoma progression. We show that inhibition of complex I by metformin promotes melanoma growth in mice via elevating lactate and VEGF levels. In contrast, it leads to the growth arrest in vitro because of enhanced extracellular acidification as a result of increased glycolysis. Inhibition of LDH or lactate generation causes decrease in glycolysis with concomitant growth arrest both in vitro and in vivo. Blocking lactate generation in metformin-treated melanoma cells results in diminished cell proliferation and tumor progression in mice. Interestingly, inhibition of either LDH or complex I alone does not induce apoptosis, whereas inhibiting both together causes depletion in cellular ATP pool resulting in metabolic catastrophe induced apoptosis. Overall, our study suggests that LDH and complex I play distinct roles in regulating glycolysis and cell proliferation. Inhibition of these two augments synthetic lethality in melanoma. ",

In vivo, highly restricted expression patterns in melanocytic tumors were identified. We therefore quantitated serum levels of MIA protein by means of a nonradioactive ELISA and investigated whether MIA provides a clinically useful parameter in patients with malignant melanomas. Here, we report enhanced MIA serum levels in 13 and 23% of patients with stage I and II disease, respectively, and in 100% with stage III or IV disease. Compared with S-100 and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 serum levels in these patients, MIA was the most sensitive marker. Response to therapy in stage IV disease correlated with changes in MIA serum levels. Measuring repeatedly sera of 350 patients with a history of stage I or II melanoma during follow-up, we detected 32 patients developing positive MIA values. At the time of serum analysis, 15 of them had developed metastases, and one presented with metastatic disease 6 months later. In contrast, none of the patients with normal MIA serum levels developed metastases during the follow-up period of 6-12 months. In conclusion, MIA represents a novel serum marker for systemic malignant melanoma revealing the highest sensitivity and specificity among currently available markers. Useful clinical applications include staging of primary melanomas, detection of progression from localized to metastatic disease during follow-up, and monitoring therapy of advanced melanomas.",

The patient was enrolled in a clinical trial (CheckMate 066) and achieved a partial response, followed by a durable complete response with nivolumab treatment. The patient's LDH levels were documented in each cycle and dropped markedly within 2 months, when partial response to treatment was already evident. LDH levels remained low for the rest of follow-up, consistent with the ongoing complete response to treatment. The patient experienced only mild immune-related adverse events (grade 1-2), which included vitiligo and rash. This exceptional response suggests that patients with high LDH levels at baseline should be considered for nivolumab treatment. LDH levels, however, should not serve as a predictive marker of response to nivolumab. Moreover, this case suggests the need to identify patients who will achieve the greatest benefit from nivolumab monotherapy.",

In current study, we have evaluated whether LDH(R1) as DNA vaccine delivery carrier can augment the efficacy of DNA vaccine immunization in vivo. Firstly, we found that LDH(R1) was efficient in combining DNA and formed LDH(R1)/DNA complex with an average diameter of about 80-120 nm. Its high transfection efficiency in vivo delivered with a GFP expression plasmid was also observed. After delivery of pcDNA(3)-OVA/LDH(R1) complex by intradermal immunization in C57BL/6 mice, the LDH(R1) induced an enhanced serum antibody response much greater than naked DNA vaccine. Using B16-OVA melanoma as tumor model, we demonstrated that pcDNA(3)-OVA/LDH(R1) complex enhanced immune priming and protection from tumor challenge in vivo. Furthermore, we showed that LDH(R1) induced dramatically more effective CTL activation and skewed T helper polarization to Th1. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that this LDH(R1)/DNA plasmid complex should be a new and promising way in vaccination against tumor.",

Currently, there is no optimal serum marker for early detection of relapse available. The goal of the study was to assess the utility of melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) serum marker in the follow up and primary diagnosis of stage III melanoma patients. One hundred and thirty-eight melanoma patients in stage III at time of primary diagnosis were analyzed at time of primary diagnosis and during periodical routine follow up both for serum MIA using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and for serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Results were correlated with the positivity of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) and the number of lymph node metastases in the completion lymph node dissection at time of primary diagnosis. During follow up, the overall survival time was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method in terms of elevated MIA (>12 ng/mL) values. Regarding SLN status, significant differences of MIA values (P = 0.024) and LDH (P = 0.007) were found, both within the normal cut-off. Having lymph node metastases in the completion lymph node dissection, significantly higher MIA values (12.55 ng/mL [±0.48], P < 0.0001) were found. In patients with three or more tumor-positive nodes, MIA values were significantly higher when compared to patients with one or two affected nodes (P = 0.024). In the routine follow-up, stage III patients with an MIA value of more than 12 ng/mL had a five times higher risk for developing recurrences (P < 0.0001). Patients with relapsing disease had a significantly (P < 0.0001) higher mean MIA value (13.76 ng/mL) compared to patients without relapse (7.52 ng/mL). The MIA serum marker can be helpful in patients undergoing lymph node dissection. Furthermore, during follow up, patients showing relapsing diseases can have an elevated MIA value.",

In the hybrid cells, under conditions of growth arrest in medium with low serum, ribosomal protein S6 was rapidly phosphorylated in response to insulin or serum. The phosphorylation of the S6 protein increased over a wide range of insulin concentrations, suggesting that insulin stimulated the phosphorylation by interacting with both high- and low-affinity receptors. In contrast, in growth-arrested melanoma cells, an intermediate level of S6 phosphorylation was observed. Insulin caused only a marginal increase and serum caused a small but consistent increase in the level of S6 phosphorylation in the melanoma cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that both cell lines arrested growth to a similar degree in the G1 phase of the cell cycle; thus, the higher baseline level of S6 phosphorylation observed in the melanoma cells was not attributable to less complete growth arrest of these cells in medium with low serum. The S6 phosphorylation results correlate well with previous results suggesting that the hybrid cells, but not the parental melanoma cells, can become growth-limited for processes regulated by insulin.",

All the patients with hypercalcaemia and/or an increased level of PTH-rP had stage IV melanoma. These findings suggest that hypercalcaemia is much more common than previously reported in patients with advanced stage melanoma and that an increased serum level of PTH-rP is one of the causative factors in hypercalcaemia in melanoma.

The aim of this work was to discover serum biomarkers in patients diagnosed with primary melanoma that identify those at a high risk of developing metastasis during the follow-up period. Proteomic and mass spectrophotometry analysis was performed on serum obtained from patients who developed metastasis during the first years after surgery for primary tumors and compared with that from patients who remained disease-free for more than 10 years after surgery. Five proteins were selected for validation as prognostic factors in 348 melanoma patients and 100 controls by ELISA: serum amyloid A and clusterin; immune system proteins; the cell adhesion molecules plakoglobin and vitronectin and the antimicrobial protein dermcidin. Compared to healthy controls, melanoma patients have high serum levels of these proteins at the moment of melanoma diagnosis, although the specific values were not related to the histopathological stage of the tumors. However, an analysis based on classification together with multivariate statistics showed that tumor stage, vitronectin and dermcidin levels were associated with the metastatic progression of patients with early-stage melanoma. Although melanoma patients have increased serum dermcidin levels, the REPTree classifier showed that levels of dermcidin <2.98 μg/ml predict metastasis in AJCC stage II patients. These data suggest that vitronectin and dermcidin are potent biomarkers of prognosis, which may help to improve the personalized medical care of melanoma patients and their survival. ",

We have previously demonstrated that the protein melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) is involved in the metastasis of and immunosuppression in malignant melanoma. Recently, we further established MIA as a therapeutic target to inhibit metastatic spread in malignant melanoma. We could show that an inhibition of MIA by a synthetic peptide decreased both the number of metastases as well as immunosuppression in a murine model of malignant melanoma. To control recurrence after surgical resection of a primary lesion, it is paramount to have diagnostic tools available that can detect a relapse due to the strong metastatic potential of melanoma. This follow-up is maintained with periodic re-examinations. Due to high cost and the associated radiation exposure, radiology examinations are avoided if possible. The analysis of prognostic markers in patient serum is therefore attractive. In this review, we focus on the quantitative analysis of the MIA protein as a prognostic tool because it has proven to be a useful serum marker for documenting disease progression of malignant melanoma. The MIA quantification assay itself is readily performed using an ELISA kit and common laboratory equipment. Because analysing MIA serum levels in combination with other established markers such as S100B improves their prognostic value, we feel that the quantification of MIA in the serum, among other markers, should be performed as a general standard of care in patients at risk of developing metastatic melanoma.

The level of antityrosinase antibodies in patients with metastatic melanoma was significantly higher than the level in healthy subjects, but insignificantly higher than the level in patients with no evidence of disease. Patients with melanoma and MAH (melanoma-associated hypopigmentation; vitiligo-like) had the same level of antityrosinase antibodies as the controls or the patients with metastatic melanoma. This observation reflected the possible absorption of antityrosinase antibodies by melanoma antigens, and pointed to the participation of the antibodies in the destruction of normal melanocytes in patients with melanoma, as part of the immune reaction towards this disease. The most interesting observation was the high level of antityrosinase antibodies in patients with vitiligo in comparison with the low level in patients with melanoma, patients with MAH, and patients with NED. Although the cutaneous manifestations of vitiligo and MAH are similar and result from destruction of melanocytes by specific antibodies, the two situations are immunologically different. The serum level of free antityrosinase antibodies could not serve as marker for the state of the disease or disease progression or relapse, as no significant difference could be detected between the levels in patients without evidence of disease to those with metastatic melanoma; nor could the levels of antityrosinase antibodies differentiate between the different sites of the primary lesion.

Of these parameters, interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been implicated in advanced stage disease and tumour recurrence. However, there is limited information available about the significance of IL-6 in metastatic malignant melanoma (MMM). In this study, we evaluated the possible relationship between serum IL-6 level and overall survival. This retrospective study included 125 patients with MMM. Pretreatment serum IL-6 levels were determined using a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed and compared using the log-rank test. Cox proportional analysis was performed to assess the predictors of overall survival, which was calculated from the beginning of biochemotherapy until death. In order to establish the possible relationship between IL-6 level and overall survival, patients were divided into two groups according to a cut-off of 5 pg/ml, corresponding to the first quartile obtained by descriptive statistics of the pretreatment IL-6 level in all patients. Thirty-five patients were in the low IL-6 group and 76 patients were in the high IL-6 group. Based on this stratification, overall survival was shown to be affected by IL-6 serum level: it was higher (24.6 months) in the low IL-6 group when compared with the high IL-6 group (9.7 months) (P=0.0006). Furthermore, Cox multivariate analysis including standard melanoma prognostic factors showed that IL-6, as a variable, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and tumour burden were significant prognostic factors for overall survival. On the basis of this evidence, the pretreatment serum IL-6 level is a predictive factor of overall survival in MMM.",

In the present study, serum protein S100 was investigated as a tumour marker for screening for melanoma metastasis in patients attending regular follow-up examinations. During the period from September 1997 to December 1998, serum protein S100 levels were measured by an immunoluminometric assay in 411 consecutive high risk melanoma patients (666 samples) and in 120 control subjects. Melanoma patients with resected primary tumours with a tumour thickness of 1.5 mm or more with resected metastasis were included in the study. Overall, 41 of the 411 patients developed metastasis during the period of observation. According to the distribution of protein S100 levels, the following different cut-off values were examined: 0.08 microg/l (95 percentile of the control group) and 0.13 microg/l (95 percentile of the group of melanoma patients without metastasis). The test efficiency for protein S100 as a diagnostic test for the detection of metastasis was highest for the cut-off value of 0.13 microg/l. In eight of the 41 patients (19.5%), elevation of protein S100 was the first sign of recurrence. Of the 41 patients with metastatic disease, 13 had elevated protein S100, giving a sensitivity of 0.32. The specificity for the detection of metastasis was 0.96. In eight of the 14 patients (57%) who developed distant metastasis, elevated S100 values were the first sign of tumour progression. In conclusion, determination of serum protein S100 levels enables earlier detection of distant metastasis in patients at high risk for metastasis.

This study aimed to analyse the impact of S100B, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the type of treatment on survival in advanced patients receiving systemic treatment.;We analysed overall survival of 499 patients from the university department of dermatology in Tuebingen, Germany, with unresectable melanoma at the time point of initiation of first-line systemic therapy. Only patients who started treatment between the years 2000 and 2010 were included. Disease-specific survival was calculated by bivariate Kaplan Meier survival probabilities and multivariate Cox hazard regression analysis.;In univariate analysis LDH, S100B, the site of distant metastasis (soft tissue vs. lung vs. other visceral), the presence of brain metastases and the type of treatment (monochemotherapy, polychemotherapy, immunotherapy or biochemotherapy) were associated with overall survival (all p<0.001). In multivariate analysis LDH (Hazard ratio [HR] 1.6 [1.3-2.1]; p<0.001), S100B (HR 1.6 [1.2-2.1]; p<0.001) and the presence of brain metastases (HR 1.5 [1.1-1.9]; p = 0.009), but not the type of treatment had significant independent impact. Among those factors normal S100B was the best indicator of long-term survival, which was 12.3% after 5 years for this subgroup.;Serum S100B is a prognostic marker predicting survival at the time of initiation of first-line treatment in unresectable melanoma patients.

Melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) has been investigated as a serum marker for cutaneous melanomas. Although the prognosis for melanoma based on stage is generally good, the disease identified at later stages is associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. The value of MIA testing in early-stage melanoma was the goal of this study. Five thousand three hundred and thirty-four MIA serum values from 1079 consecutive melanoma patients in stages I and II were obtained during routine follow-up at scheduled intervals. Sensitivity and specificity of MIA were calculated. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve and Somers' Dxy rank correlation were assessed. Metastasis occurred in 137 patients with a sensitivity of MIA testing of 67.6% in stage I and 65.6% in stage II patients. The specificity was 76.9% for stage I and 66.7% for stage II patients. The most reliable normal upper limit for MIA was redefined at 12.0 ng/ml, when compared with 8.8 and 15.0 ng/ml. Multivariate analysis revealed significantly more frequent false-positive values in elderly women and in men with an increased Breslow thickness.MIA adapted with a new cut-off level is then a useful serum marker even in the follow-up of not yet relapsed early-stage melanoma patients. In older women and in men with an increased tumor thickness, the higher rate of false-positive values should be considered before starting further diagnostics. Additional prospective studies to clarify the clinical combination with other serum markers seem promising.",

Nonrelapsers had higher mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) levels than relapsers (49 v 46 nmol/L; P = .3; not statistically significant). In the cohort (prospective) study, higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) levels were associated with lower Breslow thickness at diagnosis (P = .002) and were independently protective of relapse and death: the hazard ratio for relapse-free survival (RFS) was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.96; P = .01) for a 20 nmol/L increase in serum level. There was evidence of interaction between the vitamin D receptor (VDR) BsmI genotype and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) levels on RFS.;Results from the retrospective study were consistent with a role for vitamin D in melanoma outcome. The cohort study tests this hypothesis, providing evidence that higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) levels, at diagnosis, are associated with both thinner tumors and better survival from melanoma, independent of Breslow thickness. Patients with melanoma, and those at high risk of melanoma, should seek to ensure vitamin D sufficiency. Additional studies are needed to establish optimal serum levels for patients with melanoma.",

The objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic and prognostic values of p-proteasome with three other melanoma serological markers: S100B protein, melanoma inhibitory activity protein (MIA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the plasma of 121 stage I-IV melanoma patients. Laboratory analyses were performed by standardized ELISA (p-proteasome, MIA), immunoluminometric assay (S100B) and colorimetry (LDH). We found that all markers were relevant for discriminating metastatic from nonmetastatic patients but p-proteasome displayed the highest diagnostic accuracy. P-proteasome and S100B were the most sensitive (58.1%) and p-proteasome and MIA the most specific (98.7 and 100%) in detecting metastatic disease. P-proteasome and S100B had the highest area under receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.811 (95% CI: 0.725-0.897) and 0.822 (95% CI: 0.738-0.906), respectively. These two markers were the best in detecting patients with lymph node metastases. S100B, MIA and LDH diagnostic accuracy was increased when these markers were combined with p-proteasome. As shown with univariate analysis, shorter progression-free and overall survival rates were significantly associated with elevated plasma levels of each markers. The multivariate Cox regression analysis identified p-proteasome as the only independent predictor of a poorer progression-free survival (p = 0.030). In conclusion, this comparative study established that p-proteasome quantification in combination with other melanoma biomarkers is an attractive approach for the biological follow-up of melanoma patients.",

Enzymes are known to be autoantigens in various autoimmune disorders; thus, after the detection of antityrosinase antibodies in patients with vitiligo and melanoma, tyrosinase was defined as an autoantigen in these conditions. In some patients with melanoma the disease is associated with the appearance of \"vitiligo-like\" white patches on the skin, called melanoma-associated hypopigmentation (MAH). In this article, the authors summarize the recent data related to antityrosinase antibodies and expand on their role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo, melanoma, and MAH. In addition, the beneficial clinical applications of antityrosinase antibodies are presented.;An enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay to detect the antityrosinase antibodies in the serum of patients and healthy volunteers was established using mushroom tyrosinase. Employing this method, antityrosinase antibodies were analyzed in a diverse group of patients with melanoma and vitiligo and in mice immunized with tyrosinase.;In patients with melanoma, those with metastatic disease had a higher titer of antityrosinase antibodies compared with healthy subjects, whereas patients with MAH and those with no evidence of disease had similar titers to the control group. The titer of antityrosinase antibodies in patients with metastatic melanoma treated by vaccination with antiidiotypic antibodies mimicking the high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW MAA) initially increased after the vaccination and then decreased. High titers of antityrosinase antibodies were detected in patients with diffuse vitiligo compared with patients with localized disease and with the healthy control group. Mice immunized with tyrosinase generated a high titer of antityrosinase antibodies and after the inoculation of melanoma cells developed a lower number of lung metastases compared with an unvaccinated control group.;The appearance of antityrosinase autoantibodies in the serum of patients with metastatic melanoma and diffuse vitiligo is characterized by these two pathologies. The changes in the serum level of these autoantibodies in patients with melanoma after immunization with another antigen (HMW MAA) may have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

The most widely accepted criteria for the prognostic evaluation of melanoma are histopathological and clinical parameters, and the identification of additional simple, serological tumour markers is thus of paramount importance. Manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) belongs to a family of metalloproteins that catalyse the metabolization of oxygen radicals in order to protect these cells from radical damage. In patients with epithelial ovarian carcinomas, serum MnSOD levels have been shown to be elevated in accordance with the progression of their clinical disease. Recently, an overexpression of MnSOD was shown to suppress the malignant phenotype of human malignant melanoma cells. Therefore, we determined serum MnSOD concentrations in 33 patients with malignant melanoma at different clinical stages. Whereas MnSOD serum levels in normal subjects (n = 11) and in dermatological patients with type I allergies (n = 10) or chronic non-allergic urticaria (n = 7) were below 200 ng/ml, the MnSOD serum concentrations in melanoma patients were statistically elevated in all clinical stages compared with normal (p < 0.005).

The heterogeneity and complexity of melanoma result in the difficulty to find biomarkers and targets for early detection and treatment. Here, we investigated metastasis-associated proteins by comparing the proteomic profiles of primary cutaneous melanomas to their matched lymph node metastases, which minimizes heterogeneity among samples from different patients. Results of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by proteomic analysis revealed eight differentially expressed proteins. Among them, seven proteins (α-enolase, cofilin-1, LDH, m-β-actin, Nm23, GRP78, and MDA-9) showed increased and one (annexin A2) showed decreased expression in metastatic lymph node tissues than in primary melanomas. MDA-9 and GRP78 were the most highly expressed proteins in lymph node metastases, which was validated by immunohistochemical staining. Moreover, exosomes from serum samples of metastatic melanoma patients contained higher levels of MDA-9 and GRP78 than those of patients without metastases, indicating the potential of MDA-9 and GRP78 to be biomarkers for early detection of metastasis. Further, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown confirmed a functional role for MDA-9 and GRP78 to promote cell invasion in the A375 cells. Finally, we showed that GRP78 co-localized with MDA-9 in 293T cells. Taken together, our findings support MDA-9, co-expressed with GRP78, as a melanoma protein associated with lymph node metastasis. Investigating how MDA-9 and GRP78 interact to contribute to melanoma metastasis and disease progression could reveal new potential avenues of targeted therapy and/or useful biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis.

As lymph node metastasis usually represents the first major step in melanoma progression, we were trying to identify a potential role of primary tumor-derived EGF in the mediation of melanoma lymph node metastases. Stable EGF knockdown (EGFkd) in EGF-high (M24met) and EGF-low (A375) expressing melanoma cells was generated. Only in EGF-high melanoma cells, EGFkd led to a significant reduction of lymph node metastasis and primary tumor lymphangiogenesis in vivo, as well as impairment of tumor cell migration in vitro. Moreover, EGF-induced sprouting of lymphatic but not of blood endothelial cells was abolished using supernatants of M24met EGFkd cells. In addition, M24met EGFkd tumors showed reduced vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) expression levels. Similarly, in human primary melanomas, a direct correlation between EGF/VEGF-C and EGF/Prox-1 expression levels was found. Finally, melanoma patients with lymph node micrometastases undergoing sentinel node biopsy were found to have significantly elevated EGF serum levels as compared with sentinel lymph node-negative patients.

The changes were validated with a prognostic factors analysis involving 17,600 melanoma patients from prospective databases. This major collaborative study of predicting melanoma outcome was conducted specifically for this project, and the results were used to finalize the criteria for this evidence-based staging system. In fact, this was the largest prognostic factors analysis of prospectively followed melanoma patients ever conducted. Important results that shaped the staging criteria involved both the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) criteria and stage grouping for all four stages of melanoma. Major changes in the staging include: (1) melanoma thickness and ulceration are the dominant predictors of survival in patients with localized melanoma (Stages I and II); deeper level of invasion (ie, IV and V) was independently associated with reduced survival only in patients with thin or T1 melanomas. (2) The number of metastatic lymph nodes and the tumor burden were the most dominant predictors of survival in patients with Stage III melanoma; patients with metastatic nodes detected by palpation had a shorter survival compared with patients whose nodal metastases were first detected by sentinel node excision of clinically occult or \"microscopic\" metastases. (3) The site of distant metastases (nonvisceral versus lung versus all other visceral metastatic sites) and the presence of elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were the dominant predictors of outcome in patients with Stage IV or distant metastases. (4) An upstaging was implemented for all patients with Stage I, II, and III disease when a primary melanoma is ulcerated by histopathological criteria. (5) Satellite metastases around a primary melanoma and in-transit metastases were merged into a single staging entity that is grouped into Stage III disease. (6) A new convention was implemented for defining clinical and pathological staging so as to take into account the new staging information gained from lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy.",

Immunohistochemical detection of S100B protein is an acknowledged method for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma, and it has been suggested that rising serum levels of S100B protein are associated with the survival rate of patients with malignant melanoma. In the present study serum levels of S100B protein and urinary concentrations of 5-S-cysteinyldopa and 6-hydroxy-5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid were measured in 91 patients with histopathologically verified malignant melanoma. At the time of sampling 13 patients were in clinical stage I, 13 in stage II and 65 in stage III. The urinary levels of the melanin metabolites were determined by automated high performance liquid chromatography, and the serum levels of S100B protein by an immunoradiometric assay with two monoclonal antibodies. The overall survival rate was most strongly associated with the serum levels of S100B protein (P < 0.001), but there was also a significant correlation to urinary levels of 5-S-cysteinyldopa (P < 0.001). A corresponding association with urinary levels of 6-hydroxy-5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid was found in only a very few patients with extremely high urinary concentrations. A statistically significant increase in relative hazard was found for S100B protein levels exceeding 0.6 microgram/l (P < 0.001), and predictably for patients in clinical stage III (P < 0.001). An analysis of S100B protein levels in patients in clinical stage III showed a significant correlation to survival (P = 0.005).

Fifty-two patients with cutaneous melanoma were investigated. Serum samples were obtained on first admission before adjuvant and metastatic treatment were provided and at follow-up. Both serum M30 and M65 levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The median age of patients at diagnosis was 54 years, range 16-88 years; 30 patients were men. Over half of the patients (58%) were in the metastatic stage and most (63%) had M1c. The baseline serum M65 levels were significantly higher in patients with melanoma than in the control group (P < 0.001). For the serum M30 levels, no difference was found (P = 0.76).

The objective of this study was to determine the value of circulating serum VEGF and its possible mechanisms of angiogenesis by circulating VEGF, MMP-3, and Bcl-2 in patients with melanoma. Fifty-one patients with cutaneous melanoma pathologically verified at different stages, and eighteen healthy controls were investigated. Serum VEGF, MMP-3, and Bcl-2 levels were quantitatively analyzed by ELISA. The serum VEGF (P = 0.034) and Bcl-2 (P = 0.005) levels were significantly higher in patients with melanoma than in the control group. However, there was no significant difference in the serum MMP-3 level between melanoma patients and controls (P = 0.51). The serum levels of VEGF were significantly influenced only by Breslow thickness (P = 0.045) and mitosis (0.039) and were not positively correlated with the stage of the disease. Among serum parameters, a significant relationship was found only between serum levels of VEGF and MMP-3 (r = 0.32, P = 0.023). In conclusion, our study demonstrates increased concentrations of VEGF and Bcl-2, but not MMP-3, in serum of melanoma patients regardless of the stage of the disease. VEGF may be a potential endothelial cell growth and survival factor. The mechanism of VEGF regulation of angiogenesis may be in part due to enhanced proliferation and survival of endothelial cells by differential expression of antiapoptotic genes and in part by activation of MMPs.",

Interferon alpha (IFN-α) has been tested as adjuvant immunotherapy in high-risk melanoma patients in a number of studies, but its beneficial role is controversial. Although IFN-α treatment can prolong relapse-free survival, the effect on overall survival is not significant. However, a small subset of patients benefits from the treatment, signifying the need for biomarkers able to identify a responding subgroup. Here we evaluated whether serum osteopontin (OPN) could function as a biomarker identifying patients with poor prognosis that might benefit from IFN-α. The choice of osteopontin was based on the knowledge about the dual role of this protein in cancer and immune response, an apparent association between OPN and IFN signaling and a prognostic value of OPN in multiple other tumor types. Serum samples from 275 high-risk melanoma patients enrolled in the Nordic Adjuvant IFN Melanoma trial were analyzed for circulating OPN concentrations and OPN promoter polymorphisms in position -443. The potential relation between serum OPN levels, the genotypes and survival in non-treated patients and patients receiving adjuvant IFN-α was investigated. Although slightly better survival was observed in the treated patients that had high levels of OPN, the difference was not statistically significant.

Further experiments performed to analyze the influence of culturing the target cells in presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS), showed that the activity of sera was removed, at various degrees for different sera, by absorption with free FBS, with FBS coupled to Sepharose 4B, and with normal leukocytes cultured overnight with 10% FBS.

S100beta was measured using a commercially available immunoassay, and LDH was analysed conventionally. All markers were measured in blood samples before interleukin-2-based immunotherapy in 85 patients with metastatic melanoma. LDH, S100beta, tyrosinase, number of metastatic sites, location of metastatic sites and performance status were all significant factors for survival in univariate analyses. In multivariate analysis, tyrosinase [hazard ratio (HR)=1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-2.6; P=0.04] and LDH (HR=2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5; P=0.02) were both independent prognostic factors for survival. A combination variable of tyrosinase and LDH remained independently associated with survival (P=0.04) after adjusting for the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IV classification in a multivariate analysis involving both models. It can be concluded that tyrosinase mRNA and elevated LDH are independent prognostic factors for poor survival in this group of 85 patients. Additional studies are needed before the prognostic value of tyrosinase mRNA in metastatic melanoma can be firmly established. Further evaluation of the combined measurement of tyrosinase mRNA and LDH is warranted.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive and prognostic value of circulating HGF in terms of treatment outcome and survival compared with a widely established serum marker, protein S-100B, in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. HGF and S-100B were measured in serum samples of 101 patients with metastatic melanoma (American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IV) before and after treatment and 50 patients with stage I/II melanoma. HGF and S-100B correlated significantly with the stage of disease (P=0.032 and P<0.001, respectively). In stage IV melanoma patients, baseline serum levels of HGF and S-100B were significantly associated with treatment response (P=0.012 and 0.006, respectively). Furthermore, the Cox regression analysis confirmed that serum levels of HGF and S-100B proved to have a significant prognostic impact on progression-free survival (hazard ratio=1.39 and 1.29, respectively) and overall survival (hazard ratio=1.27 and 1.29, respectively) in advanced metastatic melanoma patients.

Angiogenin, which is a protein capable of promoting angiogenesis, was found to be markedly elevated among a sub-group of patients with progressive disease (PD) and thus was subjected to further analysis. The mean serum angiogenin level was 270 ng/ml and the median 236 ng/ml (STD 163 ng/ml). Concentrations were significantly higher among men than in women (P = 0.031), whereas patient's age, site of the primary tumour, Clark's or Breslow's classifications were not associated with angiogenin levels. Patients with only lymph node metastases had markedly lower angiogenin levels than those with metastases at other sites (P = 0.05). High angiogenin levels were significantly (P = 0.015; Kruskal-Wallis) associated with poor treatment response with chemoimmunotherapy. Treatment-related survival (TRS) was shorter (10 months) in patients with above-median values than in those with below-median levels (19 months, P = NS).

Staging of malignant melanoma is determined according to the level of invasion (Clark level) and vertical thickness (Breslow scale). Besides operative therapy, which is the only effective treatment for malignant melanoma, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and biologic therapy also are of great importance. In recent years, immunologic strategies including tumor vaccine and adjuvant therapy with interferon-alfa have been attempted to improve survival of patients with more advanced malignant melanoma. A recent melanoma research has focused on target therapy such as immunotherapy (vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, dendritic cells) and gene therapy. Genetic immunization has become an attractive strategy for the development of melanoma vaccines, because a number of antigens recognized by cellular components of the immune system have been identified at the molecular level. Numerous chemotherapeutic agents have shown activity in the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma, such as dacarbazine (dimethyl triazene imidazole carboxamide); other agents have been used, however, with less success. However, a very modest effect was recorded in advanced malignant melanoma. There are many experimental trials using combined therapy for malignant melanoma, including chemotherapy (dimethyl triazene imidazole carboxamide) and biologic therapy (interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IFN-alfa). The results obtained open particularly interesting prospects in the field of malignant melanoma with high relevance for its development and progression.

The serum marker S100B is used for prognostic estimates at later stages of the disease, but analyses are marred by false positives and inadequate sensitivity in predicting relapsing disorder.;To investigate SOX10 as a potential biomarker for melanoma and vitiligo.;In this study we have applied proximity ligation assay (PLA) to detect the transcription factor SOX10 as a possible serum marker for melanoma. We studied a cohort of 110 melanoma patients. We further investigated a second cohort of 85 patients with vitiligo, which is a disease that also affects melanocytes.;The specificity of the SOX10 assay in serum was high, with only 1% of healthy blood donors being positive. In contrast, elevated serum SOX10 was found with high frequency among vitiligo and melanoma patients. In patients with metastases, lack of SOX10 detection was associated with treatment benefit. In two responding patients, a change from SOX10 positivity to undetectable levels was seen before the response was evident clinically.;We show for the first time that SOX10 represents a promising new serum melanoma marker for detection of early stage disease, complementing the established S100B marker. Our findings imply that SOX10 can be used to monitor responses to treatment and to assess if the treatment is of benefit at stages earlier than what is possible radiologically.",

In comparison to the blood parameters, two serum proteins have demonstrated their usefulness in the follow-up of melanoma patients: protein S-100B, a member of the S100 protein family, and \"Melanoma-inhibitory activity\" (MIA), a recently described 11 kd soluble protein. We analysed the serum levels of S-100B and MIA in non-melanoma control patients and in melanoma patients in different stages of disease (stage I-IV) to report on the sensitivity and specificity of both tumor markers.;The serum concentration of S-100B was evaluated by a luminoimmunometric assay (LIA) in 670 blood samples of 87 melanoma patients and, as controls, in 169 blood samples of patients with different skin diseases apart from melanoma. MIA serum levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) in 791 serial blood samples of 87 melanoma patients and in 158 blood samples of control patients. A cut-off of 0.12 microgram/l (S-100B) and 6.5 micrograms/l (MIA) served as upper normal values in the melanoma group as recommended by the producing industrial companies. In the control patient group, we additionally used the cut-off value of 0.2 microgram/l for S-100B and 8.5 micrograms/l for MIA, respectively.;In stage I/II 37.5%, in stage III 50% and in stage IV 80% of the blood samples were S-100B positive (> or = 0.12 microgram/l) prior to treatment. Post treatment (after complete surgery) S-100B was below the cut-off value in stage I/II 83.9%, in stage III 82% and in stage IV 85.7%, respectively. For MIA we found in stage I/II 0%, stage III 53.8% and in stage IV 68.3% of the blood samples positive (> or = 6.5 micrograms/l) prior to treatment. Post treatment: stage I/II 88.3%, stage III 90.3% and stage IV 93.1% were below the cut-off value. In the control group we found 85.8% and 89.9% of the blood samples beneath the cut-off values for S-100B and MIA, respectively.;We were able to identify the majority of patients with advanced metastatic melanoma by analysing the serum levels of S-100B and MIA. The specificity of both tumor markers was within acceptable limits. However, the available data suggest that a slightly higher cut-off value might be of clinical value.",

In this study, we measured serum levels of 5-S-CD in 2648 samples taken from 218 patients in order to evaluate the usefulness of this parameter in following melanoma progression and prognosis. 5-S-CD levels were significantly elevated above the upper limit of the normal range (10 nmol/l) in stage IV melanoma patients. The sensitivity of elevated serum 5-S-CD levels in detecting distant metastasis was 73%, while the specificity was 98% and the positive predictive value 94%. The sensitivity was improved to 77% when cases of amelanotic melanoma were excluded. Patients without metastases had elevated 5-S-CD values in 5% of the 1480 serum samples. Changes in serum 5-S-CD levels were followed during disease progression until the end stage in 49 patients. In 33% of the patients, elevation of serum 5-S-CD levels preceded clinical detection of visceral metastases, and in 37% elevation of 5-S-CD levels occurred at the same time as visceral metastasis. Patients with elevated 5-S-CD levels before or after surgical treatment had significantly shorter survival times than those with normal levels. These results show that the level of 5-S-CD in the serum is a sensitive and specific marker in predicting distant metastases. Elevated serum levels of 5-S-CD, before or after surgical treatment, is associated with a poor prognosis.",

After intravenous injection into C57B16-mice subcutaneously transplanted with B16 melanoma, the organ distribution of the respective benzamides were investigated at 1 and 6 hr. n-octanol/phosphate buffer partition coefficients. The wholebody retention, erythrocyte and serum protein bound fractions of radioiodinated benzamides were measured.;While structural changes in the amide substituents of N-(2-dialkylaminoalkyl)-4-iodobenzamides 2-7 resulted in no improvement in organ distribution compared with BZA, the 3-iodo-4-methoxyphenyl form of IMBA showed high melanoma uptake with significantly higher melanoma/nontarget tissue ratios. Compared with BZA the average ratio improved after 1 hr by a factor of eight and was still four times better after 6 hr. BZA and IMBA exhibit almost identical n-octanol/ phosphate buffer partition coefficients, however, IMBA has a faster urinary excretion facilitated by a lower affinity to erythrocytes and serum proteins; this could explain the improved tissue partinioning observed. Scintigraphy of patients with melanoma metastases confirmed the promising characteristics derived from the animal studies.;Due to rapid background clearance and high melanoma affinity, IMBA showed high tumor contrast already at 4 hr after injection which makes it a promising new radiopharmaceutical for the scintigraphic detection of melanoma metastases.",

Univariate analysis revealed a correlation of sMICB serum concentration with advanced stages of disease (P = 0.009). Only a slight increase in sMICB serum level (P = 0.057) could be observed in regard to the tumor burden. Patients undergoing current treatment with cytostatics (n = 18) revealed a strong increase in sMICB serum level (P < 0.0005), whereas treatment with IFN-α alone or combined with cytostatics (n = 19) showed no change in serum sMICB concentration. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, elevated sMICB serum levels were associated with a poor overall and a progression-free survival.

Using subtraction hybridization, cDNAs were identified that display enhanced expression in terminally differentiated and growth arrested human melanoma cells (Jiang and Fisher, 1993; Jiang et al., 1994a). A specific melanoma differentiation-associated (mda) cDNA, mda-6, is described whose expression inversely correlates with melanoma progression and growth. mda-6 is identical to WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 that encodes the M(r) 21,000 protein (p21) that is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Actively growing normal melanocyte, SV40-immortalized human melanocyte and dysplastic nevus cell lines synthesize elevated levels of mda-6 mRNA; whereas, actively proliferating radial and early vertical growth phase primary melanomas as well as metastatic human melanoma cells produce reduced levels of mda-6 mRNA. Treatment of primary and metastatic human melanoma cells with IFN-beta + MEZ results in growth inhibition and an increase in mda-6 expression. mda-6 expression also increases when human melanoma cells are grown to high saturation densities or when grown in serum-free medium. Using anti-p53 and anti-p21 antibodies, an inverse correlation is found between p53 and p21 protein levels during growth arrest and differentiation. Induction of growth arrest and terminal differentiation in H0-1 human melanoma cells by IFN-beta + MEZ results in a temporal decrease in wild-type p53 protein levels with a corresponding increase in p21 levels. In the Matrigel-assisted melanoma progression model, mda-6 expression decreases in early vertical growth phase primary human melanoma cells selected for autonomous or enhanced tumor formation in nude mice. In metastatic human melanoma cells displaying a loss of metastatic potential resulting from introduction of a normal human chromosome 6, mda-6 mRNA levels increase. Taken together, these studies indicate that mda-6 (p21) may function as a negative regulator of melanoma growth, progression and metastasis.",

The first study evaluated the levels of Vitamin D at time of melanoma diagnosis and the second one analyzed the association between VDR genetic variants and risk of having a high nevus number, the strongest phenotypic risk factor for melanoma.;The levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in 81 melanoma patients at diagnosis were measured.

We have recently reported that mRNA for IL-10 was present in most metastatic melanoma tissues. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether melanoma metastases produce IL-10 protein. Single-cell suspensions were prepared by enzymatic dissociation of 28 lymph node metastases and 7 s.c. metastases and cryopreserved. Of these 35 samples, 30 produced IL-10 after a 24-h incubation (median, 125.1 pg/ml). IL-10 production was slightly diminished after 25 Gy irradiation but almost completely abrogated after modification with the hapten dinitrophenyl. After 7 or 14 days in tissue culture, melanoma cells continued to produce IL-10 but only at about 10% of the levels of freshly dissociated tissues. Moreover, of eight melanoma cell lines established from these cultures, only one produced IL-10 protein. To determine whether IL-10 was produced by melanoma cells or tumor-associated leukocytes, single-cell suspensions were fractionated with anti-CD45 antibody-conjugated magnetic beads. In four of five samples, IL-10 production was increased by depletion of leukocytes, suggesting that the primary source was the melanoma cells themselves. This was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of cytospin preparations and frozen tissue sections. Finally, 10 of 55 patients with clinically evident metastases showed elevations of circulating IL-10; three patients who had been melanoma-free developed high serum IL-10 levels, concurrent with the appearance of distant metastases. These data indicate that production of IL-10 is characteristic of metastatic melanomas and raise the possibility that this cytokine allows tumors to avoid or to modulate immunological attack.",

IL-6 was measured by ELISA in serum samples from 103 patients with metastatic melanoma obtained before IL-2-based immunotherapy. Patients with metastatic melanoma had higher serum IL-6 than healthy individuals (median 3.4 ng/l, range 0.3-93 ng/l vs. median 1.4 ng/l, range 0.25-22.5 ng/l, P<0.0001). Pretreatment serum IL-6 was elevated in 43% of the patients. Patients with elevated pretreatment serum IL-6 had shorter overall survival (OS) compared with patients with normal serum IL-6 (P<0.0002). The median OS was 10.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 8.86-13.46] in patients with normal serum IL-6 compared with 4.5 months (95% CI: 3.04-7.39) in patients with elevated serum IL-6.

Expression of cyt-MAA and HMW-MAA was evaluated by flow cytometry in NB cell lines, patients' neuroblasts ((FI)-NB), and short-term cultures of these latter cells (cNB). LGALS3BP gene expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR on (FI)-NB, cNB, and primary tumor specimens. Soluble HMW-MAA and cyt-MAA were tested by ELISA. Cyt-MAA and HMW-MAA were expressed in NB cell lines, cNB, and (FI)-NB samples. LGALS3BP gene expression was higher in primary tumors and cNB than in (FI)-NB samples. Soluble cyt-MAA, but not HMW-MAA, was detected in NB cell lines and cNBs supernatants. NB patients' serum levels of both antigens were higher than those of the healthy children. High cyt-MAA serum levels at diagnosis associated with higher incidence of relapse, independently from other known risk factors. In conclusion, both HMW-MAA and cyt-MAA antigens, and LGALS3BP gene, were expressed by NB cell lines and patients' neuroblasts, and both antigens' serum levels were increased in NB patients. Elevated serum levels of cyt-MAA at diagnosis correlated with relapse, supporting that cyt-MAA may serve as early serological biomarker to individuate patients at higher risk of relapse that may require a more careful follow-up, after being validated in a larger cohort of patients at different time-points during follow-up.

The idea of skin screening remains appealing for this common, visible malignancy which is eminently treatable when detected early. Efforts should be focused on populations at particularly high risk of developing melanoma and on those at high risk of death from melanoma once diagnosed. Persons in kindreds of familial melanoma, and persons who have atypical mole syndrome, those who have a prior diagnosis of melanoma, or those who have diagnosed atypical nevi are all reasonable candidates for routine screening, based on lower-level evidence in the absence of randomized clinical trials targeting these groups.

From 11 patients with metastatic MM observed between 1991 and 1995, serum samples were collected before and after each cycle of immunotherapy or immunochemotherapy. Samples were analyzed for 5-S-CD by automated high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Cycles of immunochemotherapy consisted of human interleukin 2 and IFN-alpha (four patients) or of human interleukin 2, IFN-alpha, and dacarbazine (seven patients). Serum value of 5-S-CD in our normal controls was 1.9 +/- 0.6 ng/ml. All patients with metastatic MM showed 5-S-CD serum levels above the upper normal limit of 3.2 ng/ml (10 nM) and ranged from 2.3-fold (4.3 +/- 3.9 ng/ml) of the normal control values in early stages of metastases to more than 50-fold (94.3 +/- 220.3 ng/ml) of the normal control values in advanced stages of the disease. In 28 of 41 (68%) immunochemotherapeutical cycles, a decrease of 5-S-CD was seen during therapy, and in 13 cycles (31.7%), an increase was seen. Patients with more than 68% decreasing cycles (defined as responders; n = 5) showed significantly longer survival times (P = 0.008) than patients with less than 68% decreasing cycles (nonresponders; n = 6). High levels of 5-S-CD were also observed in metastasizing amelanotic melanoma.

A direct miRNA assay on plasma (RT-qPCR-DP) was developed to improve cf-miRNA assay logistics, eliminate RNA extraction, and reduce specimen amount required. RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) melanoma tissues (n = 108) and assessed by RT-qPCR. Plasma (10 μl; n = 264) was procured from AJCC Stage III/IV patients in phase III clinical trials. A RT-qPCR-DP was performed to detect cf-miR-210.

In serial bloods within individual patients, cf-miR-210 < 3 months prior to disease recurrence significantly increased compared to baseline levels (p = 0.012). ROC curve analysis demonstrated that patients with elevated cf-miR-210 were more likely to have disease recurrence. Moreover, cf-miR-210 increase significantly correlated with poorer prognosis (p < 0.001).

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) play key roles in this step. The present study was conducted to investigate the levels of MMP-3 and TIMP-1 in serum of patients with malignant melanoma and the relationship to tumor progression and known prognostic parameters. Seventy patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma were investigated. Serum samples were obtained on first admission before any adjuvant and metastatic treatment was given or follow-up of patients. Serum TIMP-1 and MMP-3 levels were determined by the solid-phase sandwich ELISA (Oncogene Science Inc.) method. The elevation of serum MMP-3 and TIMP-1 levels between the patients with malignant melanoma and healthy controls were not significantly different (p > 0.05). The serum levels of MMP-3 were significantly different in males and females (p = 0.001) and serum TIMP levels were influenced by age (p = 0.047). Except for the ulceration status of the tumor, serum levels of MMP-3 and TIMP-1 were not related to the known prognostic factors such as tumor histology, localization, stage of the disease, Breslow thickness, Clark invasion, mitosis, TIL, and regression of tumor (p > 0.05). In patients with ulceration positive, the serum levels of MMP-3 were higher (p = 0.04) and TIMP-1 were lower (p = 0.008) than those in patients without ulceration. No significant relationship was found between serum levels of MMP-3 and TIMP-1. In conclusion, these results suggest that neither of the serum levels of MMP-3 and TIMP-1 could be a good indicator of invasion and metastasis nor can be recommended as a tumor marker in the management of melanoma patients owing to lack of sensitivity and specificity. However, much research still continues in this field and exciting new knowledge will ultimately emerge.",

We report the results of a prospective single institution study evaluating O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status as a potential predictive and/or prognostic marker among patients treated with dacarbazine (DTIC) 800-1000 mg/m(2) monotherapy administered as a 3-weekly schedule for advanced malignant melanomas. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee. Surgical biopsies from metastatic or loco-regional deposits obtained prior to DTIC treatment were snap-frozen immediately upon removal and stored in liquid nitrogen up to processing. Median time from enrolment to end of follow-up was 67 months. MGMT expression levels evaluated by qRT-PCR correlated significantly to DTIC benefit (CR/PR/SD; p=0.005), time to progression (TTP) (p=0.005) and overall survival (OS) (p=0.003). MGMT expression also correlated to Breslow thickness in the primary tumour (p=0.014). While MGMT promoter hypermethylation correlated to MGMT expression, MGMT promoter hypermethylation did not correlate to treatment benefit, TTP or OS, suggesting that other factors may be critical in determining MGMT expression levels in melanomas. In a Cox proportional regression analysis, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, p<0.001), MGMT expression (p=0.022) and p16(INK4a) expression (p=0.037) independently predicted OS, while TTP correlated to DTIC benefit after 6 weeks only (p=0.001). Our data reveal MGMT expression levels to be associated with disease stabilisation and prognosis in patients receiving DTIC monotherapy for advanced melanoma. The role of MGMT expression as a predictor to DTIC sensitivity versus a general prognostic factor in advanced melanomas warrants further evaluation.",

The anti-alphaGal immunoglobulin M-dependent activation of complement causes hyperacute rejection of organ transplants from discordant species by human recipients. It has been shown in vitro that human tumour cells transduced with the gene that synthesizes alphaGal become sensitive to human serum. A prerequisite for anti-alphaGal antibody-based therapeutic strategies is that patients with cancer have adequate serum levels of anti-alphaGal immunoglobulins and complement. The objective of this work was to measure the levels and function of anti-alphaGal immunoglobulins and complement in the serum of patients with metastatic melanoma and healthy volunteers. Serum complement levels were assayed by radial immunodiffusion. Anti-alphaGal immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M titres were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Disaccharide sugar blocking was used to investigate antibody specificity. The functional integrity of anti-alphaGal antibodies and complement was investigated in cell lysis assays. It was found that the levels of the complement components C1q, C3 and C4 and the function of the classical complement pathway were normal in metastatic melanoma patients. Anti-alphaGal antibody titres were as variable in metastatic melanoma patients as in healthy controls, and the lysis of alphaGal-expressing cells correlated with anti-alphaGal immunoglobulin M titre (P < 0.0001). Anti-alphaGal antibody titres, complement levels and overall cytolytic function in the serum of patients with metastatic melanoma were indistinguishable from those of healthy controls. There is thus nothing intrinsic to the disease that will limit anti-alphaGal-based therapeutic strategies for enhanced antigen presentation or induced cell lysis, including the mimicry of hyperacute rejection.",

Each of the viruses grew quickly to high titers in cancer cells expressing ICAM-1 and intratumoral injection of preformed subcutaneous SK-Mel-28 xenografts in mice with CVA13, CVA15 and CVA18 resulted in significant tumor volume reduction.As preexisting immunity could potentially hinder oncolytic virotherapy, sera from stage IV melanoma patients and normal controls were tested for levels of protective antibody against the panel of oncolytic Coxsackieviruses. Serum neutralization assays revealed that 3 of 21 subjects possessed low levels of anti-CVA21 antibodies, while protective antibodies for CVA13, CVA15 and CVA18 were not detected in any sample. Serum from individuals who were seropositive for CVA21 failed to exhibit cross-neutralization of CVA13, CVA15 and CVA18.

The disialoganglioside GD3, detected by mAb R-24, was found to be strongly expressed on most melanoma cell surfaces, but weakly on normal melanocytes and some astrocytomas as determined by serological methods. Epithelial cell types, fibroblasts and cells of hematopoietic origin did not react. Frozen sections of primary and metastatic malignant melanoma stained positive in 60/62 cases by immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase. In vitro studies with seven antibodies to seven melanoma cell surface antigens revealed blocking of melanoma cell growth by monoclonal anti-GD3-antibody R-24 only. GD3-expression varies greatly in human malignant melanoma cells. Six melanoma cell lines, expressing high levels of GD3 on the cell surface, as determined by quantitative absorption studies, showed growth inhibition in the presence of R-24 antibody. Four melanoma cell lines, however, with low GD3-expression and seven GD3-negative non-melanoma cells types remained unaffected by mAbR-24. In addition, this monoclonal anti-GD3-antibody efficiently blocked T-cell cytotoxicity for autologous malignant melanoma cells in culture. Cytotoxicity of autologous cloned T-lymphocytes, cytotoxic for the autologous melanoma cell line and crossreactive with a hypernephroma line was specifically blocked by mAbR-24 on the level of the GD3-expressing target. In an ongoing phase I clinical study, the toxicity of mAbR-24 was evaluated. So far two patients tolerated antibody infusions without adverse reactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The high expression level of TDP-43 was associated with poor patient survival. By silencing TDP-43, we saw significant inhibition of cell proliferation and metastasis in A375 and WM451 cells. TDP-43 knockdown could suppress glucose transporter type-4 (GLUT4) expression and reduce glucose uptake.

The antigen is also expressed by tumor cells in vivo. Melanoma and nevus cells, but not normal melanocytes, were specifically stained by the immunoperoxidase procedure. The proteoglycan antigen, purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody that specifically detects this antigen, was used to immunize rabbits. The resulting serum was tested by sequential immunoprecipitation and found to react with the same population of molecules detected by the anti-proteoglycan monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, the reactivity patterns of the rabbit serum and of the monoclonal antibodies with a variety of tumor and normal cells were the same. Based on the these data, we conclude that the entire proteoglycan molecule is a melanoma-associated antigen. The monoclonal antibodies and immunoglobulin from the rabbit serum were tested in a double determinant immunoassay for the detection of antigen in a total of 339 sera from patients with various diseases. Elevated levels of circulating proteoglycan antigen were found in 76% of patients with a high metastatic melanoma tumor burden compared to 2% of healthy donors. A fraction (22%) of patients with light tumor burden or nonmelanoma neoplastic disease also had elevated levels of circulating proteoglycan antigen.

MIC-1 is also expressed at higher levels in melanomas; however, its role in tumorigenesis is unknown. This report identifies a novel function for MIC-1 in cancer. MIC-1 was overexpressed in approximately 67% of advanced melanomas, accompanied by fivefold to six-fold higher levels of secreted protein in serum of melanoma patients compared with normal individuals. Constitutively active mutant (V600E)B-Raf in melanoma regulated downstream MIC-1 expression. Indeed, small-interfering RNA-mediated targeting of MIC-1 or (V600E)B-Raf reduced expression and secretion by three-fold to fivefold. This decrease in MIC-1 levels reduced melanoma tumorigenesis by approximately threefold, but did not alter cultured cell growth, suggesting a unique function other than growth control. Instead, inhibition of MIC-1 was found to mechanistically retard melanoma tumor vascular development, subsequently affecting tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis. This role in melanoma angiogenesis was confirmed by comparing MIC-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) function in chick chorioallantoic membrane and matrigel plug assays. Similar to VEGF in melanomas, MIC-1 stimulated directional vessel development, acting as a potent angiogenic factor. Thus, MIC-1 is secreted from melanoma cells together with VEGF to promote vascular development mediated by (V600E)B-Raf signaling.",

ICAM-1 expression in primary lesions was significantly associated with their thickness. Furthermore, ICAM-1 expression in primary lesions was associated with a reduction in the disease-free interval and with survival. At variance with the information in the literature, the association with clinical parameters of the disease did not reach the level of statistical significance. This discrepancy is likely to reflect the inclusion in the present study of a small number of primary lesions with a thickness < 1.5 mm. At variance with recently published data, the level of serum ICAM-1 in 75 patients with malignant melanoma was found to be nonsignificantly different from that in 47 age- and sex-matched controls. The level of serum ICAM-1 was significantly increased only in patients with stage III melanoma with lesions and in those with stage IV melanoma. Two novel and clinically relevant findings of the present investigation are (a) the significantly higher serum ICAM-1 level in patients with liver metastases than in those with metastases in other anatomic sites and (b) the progressive increase of ICAM-1 level in serial blood samples from patients with disease progression.

Serum L-dopa and L-tyrosine were determined by high performance liquid chromatography and S100B by an immunoluminometric assay. In stage III patients with elevated marker concentration, lymph node dissection decreased the S100B level (from 0.27 to < 0.13 microg/l, P=0.008), but not the L-dopa/L-tyrosine ratio. Chemotherapy decreased the L-dopa/L-tyrosine ratio by 38% (P =0.04) and the S100B level by 45% (P = 0.02) in stage IV responders. During follow-up, patients with marker levels within normal limits (n=19) had stable disease, except for two stage II patients. In patients with progressive disease (n=20), an increase in one or both markers was observed. Stage IV patients with high L-Dopa/L-Tyrosine ratio (above 20 x 10-5) at inclusion had shorter survival (3 months), while patients with low levels had longer survival (15 months). Levels of S100B had no impact on survival, as all stage IV patients (with levels below or above 0.38 microg/l) had the same survival (5 months). The serum L-dopa/L-tyrosine ratio may be influenced by successful therapy and levels at inclusion may correlate with prognosis in stage IV patients. Levels of these two markers in other biological fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid and tumour exudates may be useful diagnostically and prognostically in difficult cases.",

The patients developed high levels of cytotoxic (CTX) and complement-fixing (CF) antibodies to the UCLA-SO-M14 (M14) cells, one of the three melanoma cell lines in the MCV. Significant rises in CTX and CF antibodies occurred one month post-immunotherapy. While the level of CTX antibodies was maintained for 11 months thereafter, the titer of CF antibodies was sustained for seven months, then gradually declined. When the sera were absorbed with lymphoblastoid (ML14) cells which are autologous to the M14 cells, two residual peaks of CTX antibodies, one and four months postimmunotherapy and two peaks of CF antibodies, one and seven months postimmunotherapy, emerged. Two sera that exhibited high levels of CTX and CF antibodies one month postimmunotherapy were absorbed with ML14 cells and human fetal brain tissue. The reactivity of one serum in both the CDAC and MCF assays were abolished, whereas the reactivity of the other serum was not significantly diminished in either assay. These data indicate that the stage II post-surgical melanoma patients developed a humoral immune response to at least two distinct tumor antigens on the membrane of the M14 cells. One of these antigens appeared to be of fetal origin (OFA), the other M14-associated (TAA). Both antigens, OFA and TAA, were involved in complement-dependent antibody cytotoxic and complement fixation reactions in vitro.",

In this study we demonstrate that compared to melanocytes, metastatic melanoma cells have elevated levels of OXPHOS. Furthermore, treating metastatic melanoma cells with the drug, Elesclomol, which induces cancer cell apoptosis through oxidative stress, we document by way of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) that proteins participating in OXPHOS are downregulated. We also provide evidence that melanoma cells with high levels of glycolysis are more resistant to Elesclomol. We further show that Elesclomol upregulates hypoxia inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α), and that prolonged exposure of melanoma cells to this drug leads to selection of melanoma cells with high levels of glycolysis.

In order to appreciate a patient's individual prognosis, an attempt is made to find new tumor markers that parallel the disease progression. Objective. To identify if melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) protein could represent a tool for selecting high risk early stages melanoma patients. Method. Between 2008 and 2013, 155 patients with CMM were treated in our clinic. 84 of them were classified into stages I and II, according to TNM 2009. MIA serum concentration was measured in all patients and 50 healthy donors. A cut-off value of 9.4 ng/ml was established using the ROC curve. Results. All patients were followed up by periodic investigations every 6 months. We have noticed that 66% of patients with MIA serum values at diagnosis greater than 9.4 ng/mL have relapsed, while only 5% of patients with MIA serum concentration below the estimated threshold, recurred during the follow-up period (P = 0.000). The death risk was 12 times higher in pathological MIA group of patients (P = 0.0001). Conclusions. Our data suggest that MIA is an independent prognostic factor for patients with localized CMM. ",

Intracellular melanin contents were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay and cytotoxicity of the compounds were examined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. p-Coumaric acid showed inhibitory effect on melanogenesis, but ferulic acid increased melanin content, and sinapic acid had almost no effect on melanogenesis. Treatment with ferulic acid resulted in a 2 to 3 fold elevation in the production of melanin. Correlatively, cell viability decreased in a dose-dependent manner when treated with ferulic acid. However, ferulic acid did not affect the LDH release from the cells. Treatment with sinapic acid resulted in a 50~60% elevation in the release of LDH when treated with a 200 μg/mL concentration and showed neither cytostasis nor increase of melanin synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, p-coumaric acid inhibits melanogenesis, ferulic acid induces melanogenesis, and sinapic acid exerts cytotoxic effects in B16/F10 murine melanoma cells.

Forty-two chemokine, cytokine, angiogenic, and growth factors were measured in the sera of 20 BRAF inhibitor-treated and four combination BRAF and MEK inhibitor-treated metastatic melanoma patients using a multiplex chemokine assay. The changes were correlated with Ki-67 and CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor biopsies taken at the same time points, as well as clinical outcome, including response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Serum levels of IFN-γ, CCL4, and TNF-α were significantly increased, whereas CXCL8 significantly decreased from pretreatment (PRE) to early during treatment (EDT) serum samples. The decrease in serum CXCL8 levels from PRE to EDT significantly correlated with decreases in markers of melanoma proliferation (Ki-67) and increases in cytotoxic tumor-infiltrating T cells in corresponding tumor biopsies. In addition, a greater fold reduction in CXCL8 serum levels from PRE to EDT serum samples was associated with decreased overall survival. These results suggest that BRAF inhibition causes decreased CXCL8 secretion from melanoma cells and induce an immune response against the tumor associated with increased IFN-γ, CCL4, and TNF-α. Further studies are needed to determine if CXCL8 is predictive of response and to confirm the functions of these chemokine and cytokine in BRAF-mutant melanoma under BRAF inhibition. ",

Factors such as age, sex, anatomic location, and satellite/in-transit lesions are important in localized melanoma. Factors currently being investigated are tumor vascularity, vascular invasion, mitotic rate, tumor regression, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. For metastatic melanoma, the most important prognostic factors are site of metastases and the presence of elevated serum lactic dehydrogenase. The value of these prognostic factors to clinicians caring for melanoma patients is discussed.;A better understanding of prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma has evolved over the last decade, allowing oncologists to provide appropriate treatment for their patients. Many of the prognostic factors are interrelated. In the near future, it is expected that several molecular genetic factors will provide more insight into the prognosis of patients with melanoma.",

The most frequent S-100B protein expression pattern of the melanoma tissue was found to be diffuse staining observed in around half of the cases (52.5%) followed by heterogeneous (30.5%) and focal patterns (17%), being independent of the stage as well as the lymph node involvement. In stage I-II patients, the various staining patterns did not correlate with the serum concentration of the S-100B protein, while in stage III patients with heterogenous or diffuse S-100B staining patterns in tumor tissue, the serum marker concentration was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in patients with focal staining. Furthermore, S-100B staining of the melanoma tissue also differed (low/negative, medium and strong staining), and serum marker concentrations corresponded to the pattern of the staining intensity. In stage I-II, only strong staining was associated with elevated serum S-100B concentrations while in stage III medium and strong staining was found to be associated with significantly higher serum marker concentrations compared to patients with tumors with low/negative staining (p < 0.05).;In malignant melanoma characterized by focal and/or low S-100B staining in the tumor tissue determined by immunohistochemistry, S-100B monitoring in the serum may not suffice to detect disease progression.",

Melanoma associated antigen expression and secretion was identical to that of M14 cells grown in parallel in serum supplemented medium. Spent synthetic media was found to be an enriched serum free source for the initial isolation of 100 kilodalton secreted glycoprotein MAA. M14 melanoma cells grown in synthetic media were also shown to be adaptable to the double agar clonogenic assay facilitating the examination of clonal heterogeneity in functional studies of MAA in melanoma tumor biology. Recent investigations from this laboratory have focused on characterizing human melanoma associated antigens (MAA) found either as secreted or cell surface associated glycoproteins in human melanoma cell lines. In these studies, monoclonal and polyclonal antiserums to melanoma cell components have been developed to specifically identify these MAAs immunochemically and provide a means to study the structural biochemistry of these determinants. At this time we have identified two antigens on which our research efforts are targeted: 1) a 100,000 dalton secreted glycoprotein (100K) common to melanoma, sarcoma and neuroblastoma tumor cell lines, and 2) a 250,000 dalton-high molecular weight component glycoprotein-proteoglycan complex which is thus far restricted to melanoma cells. The ultimate goal of our efforts is two-fold. Initially, we hope to develop schemes to isolate these melanoma associated antigens in sufficient quantities to obtain detailed structural information on these molecules, and secondly, we wish to implicate these glycoproteins in functional aspects of the biology of metastatic human melanoma in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

METHODS: A total of 176 patients were randomised to receive CT (cisplatin, dacarbazine, optional carmustine) or bioCT (the same CT followed by subcutaneous IL-2 plus intramuscular alpha-IFN-2b). Pretreatment total leucocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophyls, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), erytrosedimentation rate (ESR), and fibrinogen were analyzed. Some clinical parameters (performance status, age, sex, and disease site) were also considered. As we found a positive trend for bio-CT with no statistical significance in OR (25.3% vs 20.2%) and OS (11 Mo vs 9.5 Mo), all analyses are stratified by treatment arm. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, higher value of lymphocytes percentage (P <.0001), lower value of total leucocytes (P=.005), CRP (P=.003), LHD (P <.0001), ESR (P <.027), fibrinogen (P <.0001), and no liver disease were strongly related to a better survival. In a multivariate analysis, using the Cox proportional hazards model, only fibrinogen (P=.004), LDH (P=.009) and liver disease (P=.04) were found to have an independent role on clinical outcome in metastatic melanoma patients. CONCLUSION: Liver disease and higher LDH and fibrinogen levels had an important impact on survival in MM patients. In particular, fibrinogen has been recently reconsidered both for its determinant role in the host hemostatic system, and for its capability to provide protection against NK and LAK-cell-induced lysis. These observations could have some important implications for therapeutic approaches, in particular when immunological strategies are used.",

The control group included 122 sex-matched and age-matched healthy-blood donors of the same ethnicity. VDR gene polymorphisms FokI, EcoRV, TaqI, and ApaI were genotyped by real-time PCR. In 60 patients, the total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were evaluated in serum samples by direct chemiluminescence. Associations among parameters were considered to be significant if the P value was less than 0.05. Significant differences in the frequencies of VDR genotypes were observed between cases and the control group for FokI and TaqI polymorphisms (P<0.0001; P=0.005, respectively). Heterozygous Ff as well as mutant FF genotypes of the FokI polymorphism were associated with increased melanoma risk compared with the wild-type form [odds ratio (OR)=3.035, P=0.003; OR=9.276, P<0.0001, respectively]. A significantly increased melanoma risk was observed for the heterozygous Tt (OR=2.302, P=0.011) and the mutated variant tt (OR=3.697, P=0.003) of the TaqI polymorphism in comparison with the wild-type genotype. None of the polymorphisms studied was associated with clinicopathological characteristics and vitamin D serum level. Our results suggest that FokI and TaqI polymorphisms in the VDR gene may be considered as potential biomarkers for melanoma susceptibility.

Although the frequencies of CD20+ melanoma cells within the tumor lesions were initially about 2% and the bulk of tumor cells did not express CD20, rituximab treatment produced lasting remission of treated tumor lesions in the long-term. Remission was accompanied by a decline of the melanoma serum marker S-100 to physiological levels. Detailed in-depth-analyses revealed a switch of serum cytokines from a T helper-2 to a pro-inflammatory T helper-1 cell profile.

By the restricted expression in nontransformed tissues as opposed to expression in roughly 50% of a variety of carcinoma lines of different origins, a possible correlation between hC4.4 A and tumor progression emerged. This was explored in more detail in melanoma by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. As shown before, normal human skin weakly expresses hC4.4 A. Melanocytes and nevi are negative, but up to 60% of primary malignant melanoma and 100% of lymph node and skin metastases of melanoma are hC4.4 A positive. Signal intensity in both polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization varied considerably between individual samples, which is indicative for regulated expression of hC4.4 A. To test the hypothesis, melanoma lines were incubated with human serum. Whereas expression of hC4.4 was not influenced by heat-inactivated human serum, all melanoma lines responded to noninactivated human serum with upregulation of hC4.4 A expression. Regulated expression with highest level expression on metastases is a feature that hC4.4 A shares with the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor. This feature points towards functional activity of hC4.4 A in tumor progression.",

Here, we explored the impact of selective BRAFi on the hosts' immune system.;Clinical data, whole blood counts (WBC) and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 277 vemurafenib- and 65 dabrafenib-treated melanoma patients were evaluated. The frequency and phenotype of lymphocyte subpopulations were determined by flow cytometry while T cell cytokine secretion was measured by multiplex assays.;Progression-free survival (PFS) as well as overall survival (OS) were similar in patients treated with either BRAFi. High pretreatment LDH was associated with shorter PFS and OS in both groups. During therapy, peripheral lymphocytes decreased by 24.3% (median, P < 0.0001) in vemurafenib-treated patients but remained unchanged in dabrafenib-treated patients (+1.2%, P = 0.717). Differentiation of peripheral lymphocytes of vemurafenib-treated patients showed a significant decrease in CD4(+) T cells (P < 0.05). Within CD4(+) T cells obtained during treatment, an increase in CCR7(+)CD45RA(+) (naïve) and a decrease in CCR7(+)CD45RA(-) (central memory) populations were found (P < 0.01 for both). Furthermore, secretion of interferon-γ and interleukin-9 by CD4(+) T cells was significantly lower in samples obtained during vemurafenib treatment compared with baseline samples.;While both compounds have comparable clinical efficacy, vemurafenib but not dabrafenib decreases patients peripheral lymphocyte counts and alters CD4(+) T cell phenotype and function. Thus, selective BRAFi can significantly affect patients' peripheral lymphocyte populations. Fully understanding these effects could be critical for successfully implementing combinatorial therapies of BRAFi with immunomodulatory agents.",

Total serum sialic acid and acute phase proteins are valuable adjuncts in the management of malignancies, including melanoma. The aim of the paper was to asses the level of total sialic acid (TSA), total sialic acid to total protein (TP) ratio (TSA/TP) and the level of alfa-antitrypsin (AAT) and ceruloplasmin (CER) in patients with choroidal melanoma. The concentrations of TSA, TP, AAT and CER were evaluated in 61 patients with choroidal melanoma and 84 healthy controls. 36 patients had larger tumors and 25 patients had smaller melanomas. 36 patients were treated with brachytherapy. The mean concentration of TSA in all intraocular melanoma patients was 84.86 +/- 19.37 mg/dl and was significantly higher than in control group 53.63 +/- 8.47 mg/dl (p < 0.001). TSA level was significantly higher in patients with large tumors than in those with smaller choroidal melanomas. There were not differences between groups of patients treated with brachy-therapy and those not treated. TSA/TP in melanoma patients was 11.88 +/- 2.97 and it was higher than in control group 7.32 +/- 1.21 (p < 0.001). AAT level was 236.56 +/- 141.53 mg/dl in the group of melanoma patients and in the control group was 226.42 +/- 46.74 mg/dl but the differences were not statistically significant. The concentration of CER in the study group was 28.25 +/- 11.01 mg/dl and in the control group it was 29.56 + 6.33 mg/dl but the differences were not statistically significant.

Just prior to re-staging examinations, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and the conventional parameter lactate dehydrogenase were determined in 74 patients with stage IV malignant melanoma according to the criteria of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. We found all tested serum parameters to be significantly elevated in progressive disease. Calculating sensitivities and specificities by logistic regression analysis, the highest sensitivities, according to the established thresholds, were found for interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein with 86% and 76%, respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase had the highest specificity with 94%. Calculating Somers' D rank correlation and the area under the \"Receiver Operating Characteristic\" curve, all three parameters showed high ability to driscriminate progressive from non-progressive disease. By multiple logistic regression, lactate dehydrogenase was identified to be the most statistically significant marker for progressive disease.

Up to 16 cell-surface antigens were recognized by these antisera, and 5 of the melanoma cell lines had a similar profile of cell-surface antigens.

The first vaccine we tested in this way was prepared from autologous melanoma cell lines, and the results of our trial are the basis of this report.

In two of these patients, the antibodies had specificity for shared melanoma antigens. In six patients, the antibodies were directed solely against antigens related to the fetal calf serum (FCS) used in growing cells for serological testing and vaccine preparation.

One of these hormones, melatonin among other functions, shows oncostatic properties against some malignant tumors. Our investigations confirmed the oncostatic effect of this compound based on (a) the measurements of melatonin in the serum of melanoma patients, (b) 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activity in the pineal of patients with malignant tumors, and (c) the detection of neuromelanin pigment in pineal bodies related to malignancy. Using a radioimmunoassay we have found that blood melatonin content is 4-5-fold increased in patients with the active phase of malignant melanoma. In healthy control subjects of both sexes (n = 6) between the ages 30-35 years at 10:00 a.m. serum melatonin varies between 0.47-0.65 nmol/l serum or 1.44-2.14 pg/mg serum protein. In contrast, in melanoma patients (n = 16) serum melatonin ranges from 2.07 to 6.20 nmol/l serum or 9.70-20.86 pg/mg serum protein. In another study in normal subjects (n = 24) serum melatonin level shows variations between 0.40 and 0.57 nmol/l serum or 1.75 and 2.32 pg/mg serum protein. Melanoma patients (n = 100) generally had an increased serum melatonin level ranging between 1.55 and 2.18 nmol/l serum or between 9.37 and 14.86 pg/mg serum protein. Twenty-four melanoma patients were tested several times during the duration of the disease and showed that surgical removal of the tumor resulted in a reduction of the serum melatonin level in 5 cases, remission was associated with an increase in 17 cases and in 2 cases treatment caused no change. Measurement of 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activity in post mortem pineal glands revealed that it was significantly greater in cancer patients (n = 110) as compared to other diseases (n = 30); carcinoma of the esophagus, 12.75 +/- 2.38 nmol/h/mg protein; stomach, 9.74 +/- 1.62; colon, 14.84 +/- 3.97; lung, 9.28 +/- 1.58; kidney, 7.35 +/- 0.96; prostate, 6.02 +/- 0.93; soft palate, 0.62 +/- 0.18; leukemias, 10.96 +/- 2.80; lymphomas, 10.96 +/- 2.80; glioblastoma multiforme, 11.87 +/- 3.15; multiple myeloma, 1.46 +/- 0.42 and cardiovascular disease, 0.95 +/- 0.21.

In a Western immunoblot analysis, the 53 kDa protein exhibited a strong positive reaction to the commercial p53 antibody.

E-cadherin expression is downregulated, facilitating the release of contacts with keratinocytes, while N-cadherin expression is increased, potentially contributing to more migration. Proteolytic cleavage of the cadherin extracellular domain, a process called ectodomain shedding, is one way to decrease cadherin cell surface expression. In addition, the released ectodomain could actively contribute to a more invasive phenotype. To examine if melanoma progression correlates with increased cadherin ectodomain shedding, we tested the presence of N- and E-cadherin extracellular domains in different melanoma cell lines and the presence of E-cadherin in sera of patients. Shedding occurs and is regulated in several melanoma cell lines expressing these cadherins. No correlation could be found between cadherin shedding and invasive capacity of the cell lines. However, we did find a significant increase in serum E-cadherin levels of melanoma patients with advanced disease correlating with increased S100 tumor marker values, suggesting that increased cadherin shedding may contribute to melanoma progression.",

The objective of this study was to calculate a meaningful receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for MIA based on a large patient collective and to find an appropriate threshold value. MIA tumor marker levels of 503 outpatients suffering from uveal melanoma were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fifty-four patients had confirmed metastases and 449 patients showed no overt metastatic disease at the time the blood sample was taken. ROC analysis was performed and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Metastatic patients showed significantly higher MIA levels (median 11.69 ng/ml) than patients in the group without overt metastatic disease (median 6.97 ng/ml) (the Mann-Whitney test, P<0.001). The AUC was 0.84 (95% confidence interval: 0.76-0.91). The ROC resulting from our study can be applied for test comparison by means of AUC. The AUC value of 0.84 for MIA demonstrates the accurate performance of the test. On the basis of this ROC curve, we propose a MIA threshold value for uveal melanoma patients of 8.3 ng/ml (with a corresponding sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 77%, positive predictive value of 0.30 and negative predictive value of 0.97).

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 27 HC and 35 MM patients were stimulated in vitro with IL-2, IL-12, and their combination for functional and phenotypic analysis. IL-2, IL-12, and primarily their combination, significantly induced NK cell activity, CD107a degranulation marker, and perforin expression in NK cells and their subsets in HC and MM patients. Furthermore, the combination of IL-2 and IL-12 was significantly more efficient than IL-12 alone in the augmentation of NK cell cytotoxicity and CD107a expression. Also, IL-2 and IL-12 reciprocally upregulated each other's receptors, IL-2Rα and IL-12Rβ1/β2, on NK cells and their subsets in MM and HCs. In addition, the priming of NK cells with IL-2 before IL-12 treatment led to an increase in the expression of both IL-12 receptors. In contrast to IL-12, IL-2 increased activating NKG2D and DNAM-1, as well as inhibitory CD158a and CD158b KIRs. In addition, the cytokines investigated exerted a more potent effect on the increase in NK cell activity and the expression of various NK cell receptors in MM patients with normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels. Therefore, serum LDH could represent a predictor of response to cytokine immunotherapy in MM patients. The optimization of combined IL-2/IL-12 therapy is needed to enhance NK cell functions in MM patients stratified by their LDH levels.",

We have observed an inverse relationship between IL-6 production of three B16-derived murine melanoma cell lines (NP133, HFH18, and HFH(M)) and the tumorigenicity of these melanoma cells in syngeneic mice. To further test the effect of IL-6 on melanoma growth, a non-IL-6-producing murine B16-derived melanoma cell line (HFH18) was transfected with a murine IL-6 expression vector, resulting in stable transfectants (HFH18/IL-6(+)) that expressed significant amounts of IL-6 mRNA and secreted high levels of bioactive IL-6. Syngeneic C57BL/6 mice inoculated subcutaneously with HFH18/IL-6(+) cells developed tumors that reached a final mean diameter of less than half the size of tumors that developed in mice inoculated with either HFH18 parental or HFH18 cells transfected with the IL-6 cDNA in the non-coding 3'-5' orientation (HFH18/IL-6(-) cells). In addition, mice bearing IL-6-producing HFH18/IL-6(+) tumors survived twice as long as mice bearing HFH18 parental or HFH18/IL-6(-) tumors. The specificity of melanoma growth inhibition by IL-6 was confirmed by the reversal of the slow-growing phenotype of HFH18/IL-6(+) cells by local peritumoral administration of neutralizing alpha-murine IL-6 antibody. IL-6-producing melanoma cells exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on distant parental tumors in a dose-dependent manner. The growth of HFH18/IL-6(+) melanomas was also decreased in nude mice, suggesting that melanoma-derived IL-6 may mediate this anti-tumor effect independently of a normal host B- and T-cell immune response. Thus, melanoma-derived IL-6 exerts a significant inhibitory effect on cutaneous melanoma growth and progression.

The melanoma-specific antibodies detected by both of these techniques show a remarkable correlation with the stage of disease. Study of serums from 63 melanoma patients showed that both the incidence and titer of antibodies to the tumor antigens of malignant melanoma were found to be higher in patients with localized melanoma than in those with widespread metastatic disease. Furthermore, study of serial serum specimens on melanoma patients revealed a drop in antibody titer to undetectable levels with advancing metastatic disease. Additional evidence for the importance of immunological factors in this disease came from studies of delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity in melanoma patients. All patients with localized melanoma were capable of being sensitized to DNCB, whereas all patients who could not manifest delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity to this chemical had widespread metastatic disease. Eight melanoma patients were treated with immunotherapy using BCG as an immunological adjuvant. This therapy produced a rising titer of antimelanoma antibody and temporary tumor regression in five patients. However, only one of these patients has had a complete regression and remains free of disease at two years following treatment. There was a good correlation between the patient's immunological competence and his response to immunotherapy. All patients who could be sensitized to DNCB or tuberculin and developed a fourfold rise in antibody titer had some response to immunotherapy, whereas anergic patients failed to respond to this therapy.

Diagnostic delay is frequent and patients commonly have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. Surgical excision is advocated for treatment of stage I disease; however, the most appropriate re-excision margins, including the level of amputation where required, have not been determined. Early diagnosis and excision of the tumour is the only treatment known to increase survival. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, isolated limb perfusion, and routine elective lymph node dissection have been used, but no survival benefit has been demonstrated.",

Transcript levels of p53 modifying genes as well as p53 target genes were investigated after ultraviolet irradiation, interferon-α-2b, and chemotherapy (cisplatin or dacarbazine) by quantitative reverse-transcription-PCR. Transcript sequence analysis identified three aberrations in three of six melanomas. Four of six melanomas showed high-constitutive p53 protein levels. p53 transcripts remained stable in four of six melanomas. All p53-expressing melanomas displayed high p53 protein stability. Constitutively, and after ultraviolet irradiation, mouse double min-2 expression was reduced in melanomas. We detected high homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 level in melanomas-expressing mutant p53. Most experimental conditions resulted in lower expression of p21, GADD45A, and PUMA, and a higher expression of CDC2 in melanomas.

Heterogeneity of familial melanoma risk was assessed among the families (comprising 7,666 first-degree relatives) of 1,149 cutaneous melanoma cases diagnosed in Queensland, Australia, between 1982 and 1987. The measure of familial melanoma risk was based on the number of cases of melanoma in the family in excess of those predicted from the age-, sex-, and birth cohort-specific cumulative incidences of melanoma among all relatives in the sample. Probands over-reported melanoma occurrence among their relatives, with a false positive reporting rate of 44.5% (216 false reports out of 485). Only medically verified cases among relatives were included in the analysis. There was statistically significant heterogeneity in family risk, with 53 (4.7%) of the total 1,116 unrelated families containing significantly more melanoma cases than expected considering the size of the family, and the age, sex, and birth cohort distributions of family members. In univariate analyses, members of the high-risk families were significantly more likely to have poor ability to tan, a propensity to sunburn, fair skin color, red hair, and many melanocytic nevi. When all variables were included simultaneously in a multiple logistic regression model, only the associations with tanning ability, skin color, and number of nevi remained significant.

This was due to a serum suppressor factor that inhibited the induction of cytotoxic activity in LAK precursors. The level of cytotoxicity in these patients increased to baseline levels after surgery and the serum suppressor factor disappeared in six of the seven patients in whom it was present before surgery. Thus induction of LAK cytotoxicity requires IL-2, decreases with advancing stages of disease, and is inhibited by a serum suppressor factor related to tumor growth.",

Daily, each mouse was given i.p. injections of 200,000 NIH reference units (hereafter called units) of interferon or of one of the control substances. The second experiment was similar to the first, except that bovine serum albumin was an additional control. In both experiments, the average tumor volume in interferon-treated mice was statistically significantly smaller than that of each control group. Mouse interferon preparations also inhibited the multiplication of B16 malignant melanoma cells in culture. This inhibition was statistically significant from interferon levels as low as 5 to as high as 5000 units/ml. The degree of inhibition markedly increased from 5 up to 500 units, the inhibition reaching its maximum at this concentration. The inhibitory effect of interferon was abrogated by anti-murine interferon serum produced in a rabbit.

NSE appears thus to be the marker of choice in the early stages, where its increase points to disease progression. In patients in stages III and IV the prevalence of abnormal values was 34% for NSE and 55% for S-100 (p = < 0.05).

Overall, the goals of cancer staging are to characterize the status of cancer at a specific moment in time, risk stratify, facilitate prognostication, and inform clinical decision making. The revisions to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) melanoma staging system over time reflect changes in our understanding of the biology of the disease. Since the 1st edition, where tumor thickness was defined anatomically by its relationship to the reticular or papillary dermis (Clark level) as well as tumor thickness (Breslow thickness), there have been significant strides in our use of clinicopathological variables to stratify low- versus high-risk patients. Management of the regional nodal basin has also changed dramatically over time, impacted by techniques such as lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and changes in pathological evaluation of the regional lymph nodes. Additionally, stratification of distant metastases has evolved as survival outcomes have been shown to vary based upon anatomic site of metastases and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. The variables in use in the current (7th edition) AJCC staging system are surrogate markers of biology with validated impact of survival outcomes. Going forward, it is likely that these and additional clinicopathological factors will be integrated with molecular and other correlates of melanoma tumor biology to further refine and personalize melanoma staging.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation of c-kit and the impact of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 was examined in the three uveal melanoma cell lines OCM-1, OCM-3, and 92-1.;Eighty-four of 134 paraffin-embedded samples and six of eight fresh-frozen samples expressed c-kit. c-Kit was strongly expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured uveal melanoma cells compared with cutaneous melanoma cells. Moreover, in contrast to cutaneous melanoma cell lines c-kit maintained a high phosphorylation level in serum-depleted uveal melanoma cells. No activation-related mutations in exon 11 of the KIT gene were found. On the contrary, expression of the stem cell growth factor (c-kit ligand) was detected in all three uveal melanoma cell lines, suggesting the presence of autocrine (paracrine) stimulation pathways. Treatment of uveal melanoma cell lines with STI571, which blocks c-kit autophosphorylation, resulted in cell death. The IC(50) of the inhibitory effects on c-kit phosphorylation and cell proliferation was of equal size and less than 2.5 microM.;The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.",

Cell membrane extension and migration of melanoma cells were inhibited by SIRT1 inhibitors or SIRT1 knockdown, whereas SIRT1 activators enhanced elongation of protrusion and cellular motility. In B16F1 cells, growth factor stimulation induced lamellipodium extension, a characteristic feature at the leading edge of migrating cells, and SIRT1 was found in the lamellipodium. SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM) or SIRT1 small interfering RNAs suppressed the lamellipodium extension by serum or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The lamellipodium formation by dominant-active Rac1 was also inhibited by NAM, a SIRT1 inhibitor. NAM inhibited the accumulation of phosphorylated Akt at the submembrane by serum or PDGF. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we found that NAM impaired PDGF-dependent increase in the phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate level at the leading edge. NAM inhibited the abdominal metastasis of transplanted B16F1 melanoma cells in C57BL6/J mice and improved survival.

In the present study, we evaluated the role of AC-regulated sphingolipid signaling in melanoma. We found that AC expression is markedly elevated in normal human melanocytes and proliferative melanoma cell lines, compared with other skin cells (keratinocytes and fibroblasts) and non-melanoma cancer cells. High AC expression was also observed in biopsies from human subjects with Stage II melanoma. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that the subcellular localization of AC differs between melanocytes (where it is found in both cytosol and nucleus) and melanoma cells (where it is primarily localized to cytosol). In addition to having high AC levels, melanoma cells generate lower amounts of ceramides than normal melanocytes do. This down-regulation in ceramide production appears to result from suppression of the de novo biosynthesis pathway. To test whether AC might contribute to melanoma cell proliferation, we blocked AC activity using a new potent (IC50 = 12 nM) and stable inhibitor. AC inhibition increased cellular ceramide levels, decreased sphingosine 1-phosphate levels, and acted synergistically with several, albeit not all, antitumoral agents. The results suggest that AC-controlled sphingolipid metabolism may play an important role in the control of melanoma proliferation.",

The clinical significance of serum methylated ER-alpha was assessed among AJCC stage IV melanoma patients receiving biochemotherapy with tamoxifen.

Therefore, we studied whether the levels of CD44 and HA associate with disease progression and survival of cutaneous melanoma. A series of 292 clinical stage I cutaneous melanomas was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using an anti-CD44H antibody (clone 2C5). HA was demonstrated histochemically using a biotinylated HA-specific affinity probe (bHABC). The reduced staining levels of CD44 and HA were associated with each other and indicators of progressive disease. Reduced CD44 and HA level, high tumor thickness, high pT category, high Clark's level, bleeding, and male gender predicted short univariate recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). In Cox's multivariate analysis (N: = 251), the decreased level of CD44, high tumor thickness, and bleeding predicted independently short RFS. High tumor thickness and bleeding were associated with short OS. We conclude that the reduced cell surface CD44 and HA levels associate with poor prognosis in clinical stage I cutaneous melanoma. The notion that the decreased level of CD44 independently predicts short RFS suggests that reduced cell surface CD44 enhances the spreading potential in localized cutaneous melanoma and that quantification of CD44 offers a prognostic tool for its clinical evaluation.",

Regarding tumor burden, in contrary to the detected IL-6 levels, we found that median sEGF-R levels were significantly (P = 0.045) lower in patients with high tumor burden (163 fm/ml) than in those with low tumor burden (193.8 fm/ml). An inverse correlation between IL-6 levels and sEGF-R was observed (r =-0.33; P = 0.040). No relationship between sEGF-R and time to progression or overall survival was observed while circulating IL-6 was found as a predictive factor of survival.

To date, systemic chemotherapy for melanoma metastases appears to be of only limited benefit, since tumoricidal drug levels can hardly be achieved in a way to overcome primary or secondary drug resistance of melanoma cells. With respect to topographically defined patterns of metastasis, therapeutic approaches introducing regional chemotherapy have recently promised improved palliation in the management of advanced solid tumors including melanoma. Among these approaches, isolated limb perfusion has become a well-established procedure in the treatment of melanoma which has metastasized to the extremities. The adjuvant setting of this technique is currently under investigation, and suggests a beneficial outcome in perfused high-risk patients. Intraarterial infusion techniques with or without regional venous drug hemofiltration might provide high cytotoxic tissue levels at the target region, thus subsequently leading to enhanced cell kill rates evidenced in terms of clinical responses. Angioocclusive approaches using persistent (chemoembolization) or transient (microspheres, liposomes) blocking techniques with subsequent reduction of the arterial/arteriolar blood flow may optimize the pharmacological advantage of regional drug delivery. In addition to cytoreductive surgery and systemic chemotherapy, the above-mentioned approaches of regional chemotherapy offer a new perspective in the palliative management of metastatic melanoma.",

Moreover, high percentages of PTEN methylation were associated with low PTEN transcription levels.

Although the p16INK4a locus is the most prominent susceptibility locus for familial melanomas, the low frequency of p16 mutations in sporadic melanomas suggests additional alterations in other cell cycle regulatory genes. Here we used primary melanoma tumors to reveal early cell cycle alterations that could be masked in advanced metastatic lesions due to their inherently high genetic instability. Unexpectedly, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27KIP1 and/or p21Waf-1/SDI-1 were found to be expressed in 13 of 18 (72%) of the primary melanomas with a Breslow thickness greater than 0.076 mm. In general, p27 and/or p21 staining in the primary tumors correlated with low Ki-67 index. Importantly, most of the p21- and p27-positive tumors expressed high levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin E. In proliferating cells p27 is predominantly associated with cyclin D-CDK4 complexes, but does not inhibit the kinase activity, whereas in quiescent cells p27 is found associated with inactive CDK2 complexes. p27 was also expressed at high levels in proliferating primary melanomas in culture, and found to be associated with active cyclin E-CDK2 complexes containing high levels of cyclin E. It is thus likely that accumulation of cyclin E overcomes the potent inhibitory activity of p27 and p21 in CDK2 complexes. Of the primary melanomas with no indication of invasiveness, only three of 15 (20%) were positive for p27 and/or p21. We propose that high levels of p27 and p21 may confer upon melanoma tumors their characteristic resistance to conventional therapies. In turn, high levels of cyclins E and D1 may contribute to unlimited proliferation in primary melanomas that express the tumor suppressor p16INK4. J Invest Dermatol 113:1039-1046 1999",

In melanoma, miRNAs are globally up-regulated, and alterations of miRNA-processing enzymes have already been identified. However, mis-regulation of miRNA transport has not been analyzed in melanoma yet. We hypothesized that alterations in miRNA transport disrupt miRNA processing. Therefore, we investigated whether the pre-miRNA transporter Exportin-5 (XPO5) was involved in altered miRNA maturation and functional consequences in melanoma. We found that XPO5 is significantly over-expressed in melanoma compared with melanocytes. We showed enhanced XPO5 mRNA stability in melanoma cell lines which likely contributes to up-regulated XPO5 protein expression. In addition, we identified MEK signaling as a regulator of XPO5 expression in melanoma. Knockdown of XPO5 expression in melanoma cells led to decreased mature miRNA levels and drastic functional changes. Our data revealed that aberrant XPO5 expression is important for the maturation of miRNAs and the malignant behavior of melanoma cells. We suggest that the high abundance of XPO5 in melanoma leads to enhanced survival, proliferation and metastasis and thereby supports the aggressiveness of melanoma.",

However, the role of TRIM16 in melanoma is currently unknown. TRIM16 protein levels were markedly reduced in human melanoma cell lines, compared with normal human epidermal melanocytes due to both DNA methylation and reduced protein stability. TRIM16 knockdown strongly increased cell migration in normal human epidermal melanocytes, while TRIM16 overexpression reduced cell migration and proliferation of melanoma cells in an interferon beta 1 (IFNβ1)-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed TRIM16 directly bound the IFNβ1 gene promoter. Low level TRIM16 expression in 91 melanoma patient samples, strongly correlated with lymph node metastasis, and, predicted poor patient prognosis in a separate cohort of 170 melanoma patients with lymph node metastasis. The BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, increased TRIM16 protein levels in melanoma cells in vitro, and induced growth arrest in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells in a TRIM16-dependent manner. High levels of TRIM16 in melanoma tissues from patients treated with Vemurafenib correlated with clinical response. Our data, for the first time, demonstrates TRIM16 is a marker of cell migration and metastasis, and a novel treatment target in melanoma. ",

The serum-mediated suppression was not restricted by major histocompatibility complex and was time-dependent. Addition of 10% human serum from the patients with metastatic melanoma [HS-Pt(m)] to the culture of PBMC with rIL-2 at the same time or 1 day after incubation significantly inhibited LAK activity. However, addition of 10% HS-Pt(m) 2 or 3 days after incubation did not inhibit LAK activity. Incubation of PBMC for 2 h with a high dose (10(4) U/ml) of rIL-2 in the presence of 10% HS-Pt(m), followed by incubation in the absence of either rIL-2 or HS-Pt(m), did not affect LAK cell activity. These results suggest that HS-Pt(m) inhibits the early stage of LAK cell differentiation, rather than the binding of rIL-2 to PBMC or a later stage in the differentiation. In contrast to PBMC, monocyte-depleted peripheral blood lymphocytes exhibited comparable levels of LAK activity when cultured with rIL-2 either in 10% fetal calf serum, 10% human serum from healthy donors or 10% HS-Pt(m). Addition of purified autologous monocytes to the culture of monocyte-depleted peripheral blood lymphocytes with rIL-2 suppressed LAK cell induction when 10% HS-Pt(m) was present. Thus serum-mediated suppression of LAK cell induction is largely dependent on the presence of monocytes, which may produce a secondary inhibitor that acts on lymphocytes. Addition of indomethacin to the culture did not reverse this monocyte-dependent serum-mediated suppression in a majority of cases, suggesting that prostaglandin E2 does not have a major role in the suppression.",

We report here the use of an in situ binding technique to demonstrate specific MSH receptors in surgical specimens of human melanoma. The distribution and binding properties of specific MSH binding sites were determined by autoradiography and image analysis after incubation of frozen tumor tissue sections with a biologically active, radiolabeled analogue of alpha-MSH, [125I]iodo-Nle4, D-Phe7-alpha-MSH ([125I]NDP-MSH). In melanoma specimens from 11 patients, 3 showed high levels of specific binding, 5 showed low levels, and in 3 patients specific binding of [125I]NDP-MSH was not detectable. Specific MSH binding sites were present in melanoma cells, but not in adjacent connective or inflammatory tissues. Melanotropins, including alpha-MSH, NDP-MSH, and ACTH, inhibited [125I]NDP-MSH binding in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas unrelated peptides (somatostatin and substance P) did not. The apparent affinity of alpha-MSH for this binding site was in the nanomolar range (EC50 = 2 X 10(-9) M for inhibition of [125I]NDP-MSH binding in situ), similar to that recently described for the murine melanoma receptor. In one patient, analysis of multiple intratumor samples and tumors excised on three separate occasions revealed high levels of specific MSH binding in all samples.

While melanoma cells are the original source of the melanin, keratinocytes and melanophages also contribute to the tumor colour because they contain melanin obtained from melanoma cells. However, little is known of the origin of darkly pigmented melanoma cells or of the molecular pathways regulating their melanin production. Here we discuss observations that dark melanoma cells emerge from within populations of melanoma in situ and that, in addition to producing abundant dark pigment, they appear to be undergoing autophagy. Moreover, autophagy appears to be a common trait of invasive melanoma cells in the dermis. The underlying cause of this phenomenon may stem from aberrant production of glycosylation structures known as beta1,6-branched oligosaccharides. Our studies of dark cutaneous melanomas were prompted by analyses of experimental mouse macrophage-melanoma hybrids fused in the laboratory. Like melanoma cells in cutaneous malignant melanoma, experimental hybrids also displayed abundant dark pigment and autophagy, and had high levels of beta1,6-branched oligosaccharides. Whether or not darkly pigmented malignant melanoma cells originate from fusion with macrophages in vivo remains to be determined. In any event, pigmentation in melanoma, long considered as a secondary aspect of the malignancy, may be a visible warning that the cells have gained competence for invasion and metastasis.",

The probability of survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and prognostic factors were evaluated by multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards model). The 10-year survival rate for melanoma decreased with increasing Breslow thickness (Pfor trend<0.0001) and with age (Pfor trend<0.0001) whereas survival increased with increasing levels of TILs (Pfor trend=0.0001). The 10-year survival rate for melanoma divided into TILs intensity as scanty, moderate, and marked was 88.0, 92.2, and 97.0%, respectively. In the multivariate Cox model, the presence of high levels of TILs in primary invasive melanomas was associated with a lower risk of melanoma death (hazard ratio 0.32; 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.82) after controlling for sex, age, Breslow thickness, histological type, mitotic rate, and ulceration. After including lymph node status in the multivariate analysis, the protective effect of marked TILs on melanoma mortality remained (hazard ratio 0.37; 95% confidence interval 0.15-0.94). The results of this study suggest that the immune microenvironment affects melanoma survival. ",

Tumor cells as they become more metastatic, gradually lose their dependence on both adhesion and serum. Thus, in the process of tumor progression cells undergo series of changes that allow them to adapt to different tissue milieu. This implies that during this process, points on the integrin pathway may become constitutively activated. In the present study we investigated the possible role of FAK, being one of the key members of the integrin-signaling pathway, in the multistep progression towards a malignant phenotype in human melanoma. In our study we show that in melanoma cells there is neither an increase in the amount of FAK nor in its phosphorylation capacity, but rather in its levels of constitutive activation. Indeed, in all melanoma cells tested and not in nevus and neuroblastoma cells, we observed various degrees of constitutive activation of FAK. Our results also suggest that FAK constitutive activation is regulated at least in part by the cytoskeleton, implying that steps along the integrin signaling pathway involving FAK could be among the oncogenic mechanisms that operate in melanoma and may account for the highly aggressive, anchorage independent phenotype of this tumor.",

Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that many melanoma cells exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic expression of CAP2, whereas no normal melanocytes showed detectable immunostaining for CAP2. A high level of CAP2 expression was seen in 14 of 50 melanomas and was significantly correlated with greater tumor thickness and nodular melanoma subtypes. In addition, a high level of CAP2 expression was associated with poor overall survival in univariate and multivariate analyses. For 13 patients, samples of primary and metastatic melanoma tissue were available: four patients exhibited higher levels of CAP2 expression in metastatic tumor compared to the primary site, whereas no patient showed lower levels of CAP2 expression in metastatic melanomas.

The mean level of IL-6 in the redness group (2.41 pg/L) was significantly higher than in the group without redness (1.25 pg/L). IL-8 was detected in all 27 melanoma patients in the two groups. The serum level was less than 5 pg/L in only 1 patient (6.7%) in the redness group, and in 6 patients (50%) in the group without redness, a statistically significant difference.;The Brenner sign appears to reflect a more advanced disease and herald a poor prognosis according to its correlation with the IL-8 and IL-6 blood level. However, in view of the biphasic effect of IL-8 level on tumor progression, and IL-6's ability to inhibit early stage melanoma, redness in melanoma patients could be a sign of a better prognosis of the melanoma.",

How amoeboid migration is regulated by extracellular signals and sustained over time by transcriptional changes is not fully understood. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is well known to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and contribute to metastasis, but melanocytes are neural crest derivatives that have undergone EMT during embryonic development. Surprisingly, we find that in melanoma, TGF-β promotes amoeboid features such as cell rounding, membrane blebbing, high levels of contractility, and increased invasion. Using genome-wide transcriptomics, we find that amoeboid melanoma cells are enriched in a TGF-β-driven signature. We observe that downstream of TGF-β, SMAD2 and its adaptor CITED1 control amoeboid behavior by regulating the expression of key genes that activate contractile forces. Moreover, CITED1 is highly upregulated during melanoma progression, and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis. CITED1 is coupled to a contractile-rounded, amoeboid phenotype in a panel of 16 melanoma cell lines, in mouse melanoma xenografts, and in 47 human melanoma patients. Its expression is also enriched in the invasive fronts of lesions. Functionally, we show how the TGF-β-SMAD2-CITED1 axis promotes different steps associated with progression: melanoma detachment from keratinocytes, 2D and 3D migration, attachment to endothelial cells, and in vivo lung metastatic initial colonization and outgrowth. We propose a novel mechanism by which TGF-β-induced transcription sustains actomyosin force in melanoma cells and thereby promotes melanoma progression independently of EMT.",

In a univariate statistical analysis, gender, bone metastasis, and lactate dehydrogenase and S100B levels in serum samples were found to be significant prognostic markers (P<0.05).

Although advancement of the time of diagnosis was a likely factor in the increase in melanoma incidence, the maintenance of new higher incidence levels and the increase in the incidence of thick lesions indicated that earlier diagnosis did not explain most of the increase.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the expression level of IL-8 in human melanoma cells is influenced by the organ microenvironment. A375P cells, a low metastatic human melanoma, and A375SM cells, a highly metastatic variant, were injected into the subcutis (s.c.), spleen (to produce liver metastases), and lateral tail vein (to produce lung metastases) of athymic nude mice. Northern blot and immunohistochemical analyses determined that s.c. tumors, lung lesions, and liver lesions expressed high, intermediate, and low IL-8, mRNA, and protein, respectively. This differential regulation of IL-8 was not due to the size or density of the lesions or to selection of subpopulations of cells. We based this conclusion on the results of three experiments: (a) melanoma cell lines established in culture from in vivo-growing tumors exhibited similar levels of IL-8 mRNA transcripts; (b) in a crossover experiment, the level of IL-8 mRNA was always high in A375 tumors reestablished in the skin and low in the tumors reestablished in the liver, regardless of whether the melanoma cells had been first harvested from s.c. or liver tumors; and (c) A375 melanoma cells cocultured with human keratinocytes produced high levels of IL-8 protein, whereas A375 cells cocultured with highly differentiated human hepatoma cells produced decreased levels. When A375P cells were then incubated with cytokines associated with keratinocytes (IL-1 and interferon beta) or hepatocytes (transforming growth factor alpha or beta), IL-1 enhanced the production of IL-8 protein, whereas TGF-beta decreased its production.

Such anti-angiogenic therapy is based on the assumption that a tumor cannot grow beyond the limits of diffusion (about 1-2 mm) of oxygen and nutrients from capillaries, unless angiogenesis takes place. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in angiogenesis, regulating vasopermeability as well as the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. In several types of cancer (colon carcinoma, soft tissue sarcomas and gastric cancer), serum VEGF levels are a marker for disease stage and an indicator of metastasis. VEGF levels are significantly elevated in uveal melanoma patients with metastatic disease compared to patients without metastases. Anti-angiogenic therapy, such as bevacizumab, is currently used for the treatment of metastases of several malignancies. Anti-angiogenic therapy has not yet been tested for the treatment of primary uveal melanoma or related metastatic disease. Clinicians, however, have a broad experience with anti-angiogenic agents in patients with uveal melanoma by treating the complications of radiation therapy. We will discuss tumor angiogenic processes and related molecular pathways in uveal melanoma.

Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-PCR confirmed the prominent expression of Ang-2 by tumor-associated endothelial cells but identified Ang-2 also as a secreted product of melanoma cells themselves. Corresponding cellular experiments revealed that human melanoma-isolated tumor cells were Tie2 positive and that Ang-2 acted as an autocrine regulator of melanoma cell migration and invasion.;The experiments establish sAng-2 as a biomarker of melanoma progression and metastasis correlating with tumor load and overall survival. The identification of an autocrine angiopoietin/Tie loop controlling melanoma migration and invasion warrants further functional experiments and validate the angiopoietin/Tie system as a promising therapeutic target for human melanomas.",

Some pieces of the melanoma genetic puzzle have been identified, but are not yet useful for the practical identification of patients at high risk for melanoma. Early detection is still the key for improving melanoma mortality. The most useful signs for melanoma detection are the impression of overall irregularity as compared to common nevi, the \"ugly duckling sign\" and a recent change. However, a subgroup of biologically aggressive melanoma will probably remain out of reach of early detection, due to their very rapid growth.

We investigated Fas expression and function in 53 cutaneous melanocytic lesions and 13 melanoma cell lines grown in vitro. Immunohistochemical analysis of Fas expression in cutaneous melanocytic lesions showed moderate to high levels of Fas in common benign melanocytic naevi, but low to undetectable levels in atypical naevi, primary (superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma) and cutaneous melanoma metastases. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of Fas expression in melanoma cell lines revealed undetectable or low levels of cell surface Fas expression in five of the 13 melanoma cell lines. Analysis of Fas signalling by quantification of cell death following exposure to recombinant FasL showed that a reduction in Fas expression results in resistance to FasL-mediated cell death. Furthermore, two of the 13 melanoma cell lines were found to be resistant to FasL-mediated cell death despite conserved Fas expression. Thus seven of the 13 melanoma cell lines were found to have impaired Fas signalling.

Adaptive host immunity to MAAs has shown some level of control on melanoma progression. To date, there has been no definitive report correlating the level of differentiated MAAs gene expression in melanomas with overall disease outcome. Metastasis of melanoma to distant visceral organ sites usually indicates a survival of less than 1 year; however, a subset of patients who undergo cytoreductive surgery of distant metastases survive for a longer period. We hypothesized that the gene expression level of differentiation MAAs in metastatic melanoma (AJCC stage IV) lesions would be predictive of survival. We focused on three known differentiation MAAs: tyrosinase (TYR), TYR-related protein 2 (TRP-2), and melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1); all three of them are known to induce immune responses in melanoma patients and are frequently expressed in melanomas. A quantitative reverse-transcriptase RealTime PCR (qRT) assay was developed for these MAAs to assess mRNA expression in metastatic melanoma tumors obtained from cytoreductive surgery of AJCC stage IV melanoma patients (n = 35). Patients were followed up for over 60 months. There was a variation in mRNA copy levels for individual MAAs in melanoma tumors. Elevated MAA mRNA copy levels of TYR and TRP-2 significantly (P < 0.03 and < 0.009, respectively) correlated with improved overall survival. Patients having at least one MAA expressed in their tumors had a significantly (P = 0.01) better overall survival (median 16 months). These studies demonstrate that levels of differentiated MAA mRNA expression of advanced-stage metastatic melanomas can be used as molecular predictive factors of disease outcome. The studies also imply that an assessment of melanoma tumor MAAs may provide a stratification factor targeted for active-specific immunotherapy.",

A high percentage of antibody-producing B cells was detected, but antibody reactivity was generally lost during culture expansion. Two cultures, however, remained stable for antibody productivity and one was used to develop a stable hybrid line with mouse myeloma. The monoclonal antibody (designated 3-207) derived from patient VS has dual specificity for GM2 and GD2, despite the fact that only GM2 antibody could be detected in the patient's serum. Monoclonal antibody 3-207 shows high-titered reactivity with a range of melanoma, astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, and leukemia cell lines, cells with prominent cell surface expression of GM2 and GD2. The cell surface reactivity of monoclonal antibody 3-207 was not abolished by treatment of target cells with neuraminidase, as the enzyme converted GD2 to GM2, which was still detected by monoclonal antibody 3-207.",

Metastatic melanoma is associated with poor prognosis, as the current treatments do not have a significant impact on prolonging survival or decreasing mortality. We have identified a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, macrophage inhibitory cytokine (MIC)-1, which is highly expressed in melanoma cells. Of 53 melanoma cell lines that were examined for relative MIC-1 expression by western blot analysis, 35 (66%) showed significantly higher levels of MIC-1 compared to normal melanocytes. Primary melanoma biopsies (15 of 22) were found to contain cells expressing low levels of MIC-1 as determined by immunohistochemistry. In contrast, all metastatic melanoma biopsies examined (16 of 16) had strong expression of MIC-1. Expression of MIC-1 was found to be dependent on the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and is a transcriptional target of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor. Knockdown of MIC-1 expression using stable short-hairpin RNA in three melanoma cell lines showed a significant decrease in tumorigenicity (P<0.0001). These results indicate that MIC-1 may function to promote development of more aggressive melanoma tumors. MIC-1 may be suitable for development as a serum diagnostic and is a possible target for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.",

Prognoses for melanoma patients are currently based on statistical parameters. For estimating the risk for a possible progression and for overall survival, Breslow tumour thickness and the invasion level (Clark level) are the most established markers for melanomas at the time of the primary diagnosis. In thicker melanomas (>1 mm) the additional information about the status of the sentinel lymph-node (SLN) might be helpful. Nevertheless new prognostic parameters are needed, that will allow us to formulate more precise prognoses for the individual cases. The metallo-thionein family is a class of intracellular low-molecular-weight, cysteine-rich proteins with a high affinity for heavy-metal ions. They are involved in many (patho-) physiological processes and presumably play an important role in the carcinogenesis. In the last decades overexpression of immunohistochemically labelled metallothioneins (MTs) on paraffin-embedded tissues turned out as a highly significant prognostic marker in different tumours. This review summarizes the results of those studies, in which MT-overexpression was able to show a very high significance for progression and survival in melanoma patients. In contrast to most other progression markers, MT-overexpression is independent from tumour-thickness, and is highly specific even in thin (low risk) melanoma patients. Nowadays, in high risk melanoma patients sentinel lymph-node (SLN-) biopsy is performed, a surgical technique with predictive value for progression, the benefit of this procedure for the individual overall survival still remains unclear. In a study comparing SLN and MT-overexpression the results corroborate the validity of MT-overexpression in primary melanoma as a useful additional prognostic marker, accuracy is comparable although to some degree supplementary to the results of SLN biopsy.",

BM aspirates and peripheral blood (PB) plasma from 56 patients and BM aspirates from 29 healthy volunteers were collected. S100B was measured using an immune radiometric assay, which is a two-site sandwich assay based on monoclonal antibodies recognizing the beta-subunit. In the control population, the median S100B level in BM plasma was 9.0 microg/l (26 women and three men), an unexpectedly high value compared with the median S100B level in PB<0.05 microg/l. S100B levels in BM seems to be sex dependent. Median S100B levels in samples taken from male melanoma patients was 26.7 microg/l in contrast to 9.3 microg/l in female patients (Mann-Whitney P<0.002). The elevated BM S100B in melanoma patients could not be explained by presence of melanoma cells in the BM, as the values also were increased to the same extent in patients with no detectable BM metastases. In attempts to identify the source of S100B in BM, cytospins from five patients with high S100B values were stained, but none of the BM cells stained positive. S100B levels in PB were dependent on the stage of melanoma disease and there was a significant shorter survival time in the group of patients with elevated S100B compared with the group with normal S100B values, (log rank test: P=0.04). In BM taken from melanoma patients, however, there were no association between S100B levels and survival. The median S100B level in BM aspirates from healthy female volunteers and BM samples from female melanoma patients were 8.1 and 9.3 microg/l both manifold higher than the cut-off value for S100B in PB (0.2 microg/l). The median S100B in the samples taken from male melanoma patients was nearly three times higher than in the female patients. Unlike S100B in PB, S100B in BM demonstrated no prognostic value. The explanation for the unexpected high S100B in BM remains elusive.",

Intermittent exposure to the sun, as in recreational exposure, may be a more potent cause of melanoma than more continuous exposure. Primary prevention offers the best prospects for a substantial reduction in mortality from malignant melanoma. However, there is little evidence available to judge the effectiveness of primary prevention of melanoma through reduction of exposure to the sun. Education for reducing exposure to the sun is common in high-risk populations but has never been evaluated adequately. Mortality from melanoma could also possibly be reduced by earlier diagnosis through education or screening of high-risk groups.

Therefore, knowledge of patient characteristics and behaviour associated with a high tumour thickness is essential for the development and improvement of melanoma prevention campaigns.;The present study aimed to identify sociodemographic, clinical and behavioural factors associated with high tumour thickness according to Breslow.;The study population consisted of 217 patients with histologically proven primary invasive cutaneous melanomas seen at the Department of Dermatology and Allergology at the Ludwig-Maximilian-University Munich, Germany, between January 1999 and January 2001. Personal interviews were conducted by two physicians to obtain information on sociodemographic characteristics and on patients' knowledge of melanoma symptoms, sun behaviour, delay in diagnosis and related factors. Multivariate linear and logistic regression analysis with stepwise variable selection was used to identify risk groups with a high tumour thickness. To assess possible effect modifications, interaction terms were included in the regression analysis.;The median tumour thickness was 0.8 mm (interquartile range 0.5-1.6). Fifty-seven patients (26%) had tumour thickness >1.5 mm. In a multivariate linear regression analysis, patients living alone and patients with a low educational level showed a significantly greater tumour thickness. The relation of melanoma knowledge to tumour thickness was modified by the melanoma subtype: whereas lack of melanoma knowledge led to an increased tumour thickness for the subtypes superficial spreading melanoma, lentigo maligna melanoma and unspecified malignant melanoma, no significant effect was estimated for the subtypes nodular melanoma (NM) and acrolentiginous melanoma (ALM). Sex, age, self-detection of melanoma, patient delay and professional delay were not significantly associated with the tumour thickness in multivariate linear regression. Similar results were found in multivariate logistic regression.;An increased tumour thickness was found in subjects living alone and having a low educational level. These subjects should be targeted in future prevention campaigns in a more focused way. Further efforts are necessary to improve knowledge and earlier detection of melanoma subtypes NM and ALM.",

The expression of COX-2 was determined immunohistochemically in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of 33 early Clark I/II melanomas and 58 naevi. Mean COX-2 expression in melanomas was significantly stronger than in naevi (P approximately 10(-13)). A simple diagnostic algorithm using threshold values of the COX-2 expression level allows for differentiation between early melanomas and naevi with high sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) (for Se between 91 and 100%, Sp values change between 96.5 and 51.7%). Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were, respectively, 0.97+/-0.02 and 0.86+/-0.04 for the COX-2 expression in central and border regions of the lesions. For all the melanomas (not only the early ones),the respective areas under the ROC curve values were 0.98+/-0.01 and 0.97+/-0.02.

Overall survival was analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier estimator and compared with log-rank analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify prognostic factors significant for survival.;The median overall survival of the entire cohort was 5.0 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4 months-5 months). Significant prognostic factors in the univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis were Karnofsky performance status (≥70% vs <70%; P < .001), number of BM-MM (single vs multiple; P < .001), pretreatment levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (normal vs elevated; P < .001) and S-100 (normal vs elevated; P < .001), prognostic groups according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (class I vs class II vs class III; P = .0485), and treatment choice (for the cohort with single BM-MM only) (stereotactic radiotherapy or neurosurgical metastasectomy vs others; P = .036). Cox proportional hazards models revealed pretreatment elevated level of serum LDH (hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-2.0 [P = .00013]) and number of BM-MM (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-2.0 [P = .00011]) to be independent prognostic variables in the entire cohort, whereas in patients with a single BM-MM, treatment choice (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9 [P = .0061]) was identified as a unique prognostic factor.;The overall survival of patients with BM-MM primarily depends on the number of metastases and pretreatment level of LDH.

The present studies have shown that these blocking factors against melanoma LDA can be detected in patients with primary melanoma, and that the levels of this activity show an inverse correlation with the levels of LDA in the sera of melanoma patients. The appearance of melanoma LDA after surgery for localized melanoma was shown in approximately a third of the patients, and this pattern was shown to result from the disappearance of the LDA blocking activity after surgical removal of the melanoma. Assays were designed specifically to measure the melanoma LDA blocking factors by plasmapheresis. It is not yet known whether the melanoma LDA blocking activity has correlation with tumour growth in melanoma patients. The potential value of measuring this activity to assess response to therapy was shown by studies designed to remove the blocking factors by plasmapheresis. It is not yet known whether the melanoma LDA blocking activity has biological significance in regard to tumour growth, but these studies appear to indicate that measurement of these factors in the sera of melanoma patients may provide a useful in vitro monitor of tumour growth in melanoma patients.",

In a panel of 12 cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma of the superficial spreading type, cells in florid melanoma in situ (MIS) and invasive cells in the dermis appeared to be undergoing autophagy. Autophagosomes were detected through immunohistochemistry using the marker LC3B (microtubule-associated light chain 3B), and by electron microscopy. Some autophagosomes contained melanized melanosomes, accounting for the phenomenon of 'coarse melanin' in malignant melanoma. Autophagosomes also contained the Golgi 58k protein, a structural component of the Golgi apparatus, and beta1,6-branched oligosaccharides, indicating that at least some of the autophagosomal proteins were glycosylated with these structures. The findings suggest that autophagy could be a constitutive metabolic state for invasive and metastatic melanoma cells. Interestingly, a similar phenotype was also expressed by tumor-associated melanophages. The findings are consistent with previous reports that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress drives melanoma progression, since ER stress is known to trigger autophagy. The results suggest that therapies inhibiting autophagy may be effective for the treatment of malignant melanoma by depriving cells of an important energy source.",

Early relapse detection and monitoring of therapy response are crucial for efficient treatment of advanced melanoma. Thus, there is a need for blood-based biomarkers in melanoma management. Serum-derived U2 small nuclear RNA fragments (RNU2-1f) were previously shown to be blood-based biomarkers for gastrointestinal and gynecologic malignancies. Here we examined whether RNU2-1f may also serve as diagnostic biomarker in advanced melanoma.;Circulating RNU2-1f levels were quantified by comparative reverse transcription PCR in a training cohort of patients with metastatic melanoma (n=33, thereof regionally metastasized to skin and lymph nodes, n=23, and distantly metastasized, n=10) vs. patients with benign naevi (n=16) vs. healthy controls (n=39). RESULTS were validated in an independent patient cohort with distant metastasis (n=16) vs. controls (n=18).;Circulating RNU2-1f levels in the training cohort were significantly increased in serum of regionally and distantly metastatic patients, compared with patients with benign naevi or healthy controls (p<0.0001) and allowed accurate detection of regional (AUC 0.80) as well as distant (AUC 0.84) metastasis. In the validation cohort, increased RNU2-1f levels were confirmed and enabled highly specific detection of distant metastasis (sensitivity 81%, specificity 100%, AUC 0.94).;This is the first report to suggest a blood-based snRNA serving as a diagnostic biomarker for melanoma metastasis. Our data provide a rationale for further defining clinical utility of circulating RNU2-1f in metastasis detection in the management of melanoma patients at risk of relapse and/or with advanced disease.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Concerns regarding the hepatotoxicity of adenovirus for cancer gene therapy have led to attempts to engineer viruses for tissue-specific gene expression and tissue-specific replication. The Tyrex2 (a tandem murine melanocyte-specific enhancer) system was used to express luciferase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), and the essential adenoviral gene E1A. In nonmelanoma cell lines, the CMV promoter/enhancer (CMV p/e) was 969 times stronger than the Tyrex2 construct, whereas in melanoma cells it was only 2.6 times stronger. An adenovirus with Tyrex2 regulating PNP (Ad2Tyr2-PNP) was tested for cytotoxicity. In melanoma cells, treatment with Ad2Tyr2-PNP plus the prodrug 6-methylpurine deoxyriboside (6-MPDR) resulted in 90% cytotoxicity by day 4. In non-melanoma cell lines, only the CMV p/e resulted in significant cytotoxicity. We compared the intrinsic E1A promoter/enhancer (E1A p/e) system with the melanoma-specific constructs and found that the Tyrex2 system achieved higher levels of luciferase than the E1A p/e in all melanoma lines tested. In non-melanoma cell lines, the E1A p/e is 12.4 times stronger than the Tyrex2 construct. Tyrex2 was then used to regulate adenoviral E1A expression to construct a melanoma-specific replicating adenovirus. We were unable to achieve selective replication. As E1A is a known transactivator of the adenovirus major late promoter (MLP), we studied the ability of the MLP to express a transgene in the context of tissue-selective E1A expression. We were able to demonstrate high levels of luciferase activity with this construct; however, selectivity was lost. Melanoma-specific adenovirus expression was achieved with the Tyrex2 construct, and this led to melanoma-specific cytotoxicity by the potent PNP suicide gene. Selective melanoma-specific replication was not successful. The MLP may be a useful promoter in the context of a tissue-specific replicating adenovirus.",

We have studied the effects of a chemical conjugate of pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) and the antibody 9.2.27, which recognizes the high molecular weight melanoma associated antigen (HMW-MAA) expressed in most malignant melanomas and melanoma cell lines. We demonstrate that the 9.2.27PE immunotoxin (IT) induces cell death in malignant melanoma cells through protein synthesis inhibition followed by some morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis, like rounding up of cells, chromatin condensation and inactivation of PARP. Unlike previous results with the 425.3PE IT in breast cancer cells, we detected no depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane after 9.2.27PE IT treatment. This is likely due to the lack of strong activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. The lack of depolarization suggests that cytochrome c, a molecule that triggers activation of caspase-3, was retained within the mitochondria. In addition, the protein level of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 did not decrease in contrast to other antiapoptotic molecules belonging to the inhibitor of apoptosis and the Bcl-2 family. This suggests that Bcl-2 may play a role in maintaining the mitochondrial membrane integrity in the 9.2.27PE-treated cells. Nevertheless, 9.2.27PE IT efficiently killed malignant melanoma cells that can be ascribed to inhibition of protein synthesis followed by some morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis.",

The detected expression levels were correlated with each other, with clinicopathologic data, and with melanoma survival.;The loss of AP-2 expression was significantly associated with low p21 expression (P=.007), high tumor thickness (P=.001), high Clark's level (P=.046), high tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) category (P=.006), recurrent disease (P=.001), and male sex (P=.03). Tumor thickness, Clark's level, TNM category, bleeding, AP-2 index, and sex were all important predictors of both recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) of melanoma in this order. In Cox's multivariate analysis, high tumor thickness (P=.0001), low AP-2 index (P=.0153), and bleeding (P=.0143) predicted poor RFS. Poor OS was predicted by high tumor thickness (P=.0008) and bleeding (P=.0092).;The loss of AP-2 expression seems to be associated with malignant transformation and tumor progression in cutaneous malignant melanoma.

One hundred and seventeen primary melanomas and 18 metastatic tissue samples were analysed for immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67, Bcl-2 and p53. The staining results were correlated with disease progression and clinical outcome. The patient population comprised patients diagnosed with melanoma between 1988 and 1991. The clinical follow-up period for disease recurrence was 4.6 years (median; range, 0.2-7.5 years) and the follow-up period for overall survival was 10.0 years (median; range, 8.6-15.6 years). Ki-67 expression was not a prognostic factor in primary melanoma. High Bcl-2 expression was associated with such adverse prognostic factors as male gender, old age of the patient and tumour ulceration. High Bcl-2 expression was also associated with an adverse prognosis in intermediate-thickness (1.01-4.0 mm) melanomas (n=52) for disease-free (P=0.09) and overall (P=0.08) survival. In multivariate analysis, tumour thickness was the strongest prognostic factor for disease-free survival (P<0.01). High p53 expression indicated a poorer prognosis (P=0.05). In metastatic melanoma, the expression levels of Bcl-2 and p53 were lower than those in their primary counterparts (P=0.08 for each). Ki-67 expression showed no remarkable changes. It can be concluded that high p53 expression in tumour cells is associated with a poorer prognosis in primary melanoma, and high Bcl-2 expression in tumour cells is an adverse prognostic marker in intermediate-thickness primary melanoma.",

In this study, the potential impact of RGS1 as a molecular prognostic marker for melanoma was assessed using immunohistochemical analysis of a melanoma tissue microarray containing primary cutaneous melanomas from 301 patients. High RGS1 expression was significantly correlated with increased tumor thickness (P=0.0083), mitotic rate (P=0.04), and presence of vascular involvement (P<0.02).

In order to study the biology of this disease, the activity of the c-myc oncogene was studied in tumours from 24 patients with subungual melanoma using the technique of flow cytometry. High levels of oncoprotein were found in all tumours and exceeded that documented in other varieties of cutaneous melanoma. Survival analysis revealed that stratification of patients according to oncogene activity provided a useful prognostic marker with shorter disease free interval (log rank test, chi 2 = 6.6, P = 0.01) and overall survival (log rank test, chi 2 = 3.6, P = 0.07) in tumours with high oncoprotein levels. This is the first study to investigate oncogene expression in subungual disease and supports its potential application as a prognostic marker.",

Enhanced survival in these family members could be influenced by their knowledge of melanoma risk and by simple behaviors to decrease their risk or detect melanoma in its early, most curable, stage. Yet, there is minimal exploration on communication of risk or risk-modifying behaviors in melanoma at-risk families. In this study, we describe perceived intrafamily communication of melanoma risk. Using a qualitative descriptive approach, we examined in-depth interviews with 22 members of 8 families having 2 or more cases of melanoma. We identified 4 major themes: (1) awareness and understanding of risk, (2) families facilitate and hinder communication, (3) promoting melanoma prevention and detection in the family, and (4) an obligation to tell others. We discuss these findings in the context of extant knowledge of cancer risk communication in families at high risk for other cancers, impediments to cancer risk communication, remaining gaps in knowledge of this phenomenon, suggestions for hypothesis-driven research, and clinical implications that are applicable to these and other at-risk families.",

The four major types of malignant melanoma are lentigo maligna melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma, superficial spreading melanoma, and nodular melanoma. Lentigo maligna melanoma has irregular margins and usually occurs on sunlight-exposed skin in elderly patients. Acral lentiginous melanoma occurs on the hands and feet; it often demonstrates massive invasion when the vertical growth phase occurs. Among Caucasians, superficial spreading melanoma, which affects the trunk and extremities, is the most common malignant melanoma. These lesions are often variegated in color. Nodular melanomas are deeply pigmented and enlarge rapidly. For microstaging of malignant melanoma, determining Clark's level of tumor invasion or Breslow's thickness (from the top of the granular cell layer of the epidermis to the deepest extension of the tumor) is useful for assessment of prognosis. Establishing a definite diagnosis of malignant melanoma is feasible through clinicopathologic correlation.

AdCMVIFN-beta was injected either intravenously or directly into the intraocular melanomas. The effect of gene transfer on liver metastases was ascertained by histopathologic analysis of the livers and by measuring serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which are two enzymes associated with liver metastases in patients with uveal melanoma.;Mice treated with two intratumoral injections of AdCMVIFN-beta had a 68% reduction in metastatic liver lesions (P = 0.016) and a 51% reduction in liver enzyme levels compared with control mice (P = 0.02). However, the antimetastatic effect of AdCMVIFN-beta was not directly attributable to the adenovirus vector or virus-mediated cytolysis of tumor cells. Intravenous treatment with AdCMVIFN-beta resulted in an 86% reduction in the number of metastatic foci in the liver (P = 0.014) and a 61% reduction of serum AST levels compared with mice treated with AdCMVLacZ (P = 0.015). AdCMVIFN-beta treatment produced a sharp increase in the NK cell activity that was demonstrable in vivo and in vivo.

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition melanoma staging, implemented in 2010, replaced the level of invasion with the mitotic rate for T1 substaging, on the basis of prognostic modeling, not prediction of occult lymph node metastasis. Previously, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was recommended for T1b patients, whereas current guidelines suggest SLNB for select high-risk T1 melanomas. We investigated the effect of this staging change on the performance and outcomes of SLNB for T1 melanoma. Using 2004-2010 data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Registry, we identified 32 527 cases of T1 melanoma and compared pre-2010 (N=27 170) with 2010 (N=5357) data. We used χ-tests, t-tests, and logistic regression models for analysis. After implementation of the 2010 AJCC staging system, SLNB for T1 patients increased from 12.1% (2004) to 14.4% (2010), despite a decrease for T1b melanomas (40.9 to 33.3%; both P values<0.001), and there was no change in SLNB for melanomas that were 0.7 mm or thicker (38.3 and 39.3%). T-stage, thickness, level, ulceration, age, and geographic region were correlated with SLNB performance (all P values<0.001). For T1 patients, overall SLN positivity rates were 6.1% pre-2010 and 7.8% in 2010 (P=0.12), while nearly doubling for T1a patients (3.6 to 6.6%, P=0.03). SLN-positive patients had diminished cancer-specific survival (P<0.001). SLNB for T1b melanomas decreased after AJCC T1 reclassification, without changing for melanomas that were 0.7 mm or thicker. SLN positivity rates increased for T1a melanomas, and SLN status was prognostic for T1 patients. Improved strategies to identify high-risk T1 melanoma patients most likely to benefit from SLN surgery and to minimize clinical practice variation would be valuable. ",

The process of angiogenesis is tightly controlled by positive and negative regulators. Since many of these factors can be measured in the serum of patients, their use as tumour markers has been suggested. The angiopoietins 1 and 2 have been demonstrated to be secreted by various tumour cells. By binding to the Tie-2 receptor on endothelial cells, they regulate angiogenesis. Whereas angiopoietin-1 maintains quiescence of vessels, angiopoietin-2 increases angiogenesis by destabilising vessels and sensitising them to the effect of growth factors of the VEGF family. Since both angiopoietins compete for the same Tie-2 receptor and cause opposite effects concerning angiogenesis, the ratio between these two ligands is crucial. Therefore, we have measured serum levels of both angiopoietins in the serum of 148 melanoma patients at different stages of disease. Whereas angiopoietin-1 levels did not change during disease progression, angiopoietin-2 levels were significantly higher in advanced stage disease. Compared to the established tumour-marker S100B, angiopoietin-2 levels or the ratio between both angiopoietins did not show increased sensitivity for the early detection of advanced stages of malignant melanoma. In conclusion, the ratio between both angiopoietins is significantly altered in late stage melanoma patients, shifting the balance to favour angiogenesis.",

Given the prevalence of PTEN and BRAF mutations in melanoma, we first examined translation initiation, as measured by phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (p-4E-BP1), in metastatic melanoma tissues and cell lines. We then tested the association between amounts of total and p-4E-BP1 and patient survival.;Seven human metastatic melanoma cells lines and 72 metastatic melanoma patients with accessible metastatic tumor tissues and extended follow-up information were studied. Expression of 4E-BP1 transcript, total 4E-BP1 protein, and p-4E-BP1 was examined. The relationship between 4E-BP1 transcript and protein expression was assessed in a subset of patient tumors (n = 41). The association between total and p-4E-BP1 levels and survival was examined in the larger cohort of patients (n = 72).;4E-BP1 was hyperphosphorylated in 4 of 7 melanoma cell lines harboring both BRAF and PTEN mutations compared with untransformed melanocytes or RAS/RAF/PTEN wild-type melanoma cells. 4E-BP1 transcript correlated with 4E-BP1 total protein levels as measured by the semiquantitative reverse-phase protein array (P = 0.012). High levels of p-4E-BP1 were associated with worse overall and post-recurrence survival (P = 0.02 and 0.0003, respectively).;Our data show that translation initiation is a common event in human metastatic melanoma and correlates with worse prognosis. Therefore, effective inhibition of the pathways responsible for 4E-BP1 phosphorylation should be considered to improve the treatment outcome of metastatic melanoma patients.",

To this end we have prepared and tested a new alpha-emitting radioimmunoconjugate (RIC) against malignant melanoma. The melanoma antibody 9.2.27 is specific for most melanoma cell lines. This antibody was labelled with an a emitter, bismuth-213 (213Bi), and a positron emitter, terbium-152 (152Tb), which is an analogue of the alpha-emitting radioisotope terbium-149. The chelators cDTPAa (a cyclic anhydride of diethylenetriamine pentacetic acid) and CHX-A\" (a 2-(p-SCN-Bz)-cyclohexyl-DTPA ligand) were used in order to obtain high labelling yields for both isotopes with either chelator. The labelling efficiency with 213Bi was found to be 96% and 92% with cDTPAa and CHX-A\", respectively. With 152Tb it was 93% and 89%, respectively. Serum stability studies showed 20% leaching with 213Bi over a period of 2.5 half-lives. For 152Tb the leaching was 13%. There was no difference in the melanoma cell binding of the labelled and unlabelled antibodies. DNA synthesis data were compared for both isotopes with either chelator. Based on these results, the therapeutic activity ratio for 213Bi a particles and 152Tb positrons for the same endpoint was calculated to be 120. The stability of the bismuth and terbium RICs, together with the outstanding cytotoxicity of the alpha emitter, provides the basis for a new approach to the potential control of micrometastatic melanoma.",

From 1973 to 1999, there were 7,785 cases of invasive melanoma identified through the Utah Cancer Registry. These were linked to the Utah Population Database, resulting in 2,659 subjects with family-history information from which a familiality score could be calculated. Cases scored in the top ninth percentile were assigned as high familial risk, and the remaining 91% were considered low familial risk.;Multivariate logistic-regression analysis found no association between sex, Breslow depth, Clark level, or survival and the familial status. Age at first diagnosis of invasive melanoma was slightly lower in the high-familial-risk group (57 v 60 years; P = .03). High-familial-risk subjects had more melanomas diagnosed at age 30 or younger (12% v 6%; P < .001).

After purification and partial sequencing of the peptide, a fragment of the MIA cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR. This cDNA fragment was used to screen phage libraries and subsequently fully encoding human and murine MIA cDNA and genomic DNA clones were obtained. The MIA gene spans a region of approximately 2 kb and is divided into 4 exons. Mapping the MIA gene revealed that the human gene is located on chromosome 19 and the murine gene on chromosome 7. The MIA open reading frame spans 131 (human) or 130 (murine) amino acids. The first 24 (human) or 23 (murine) amino acids represent a signal sequence directing the secretion of MIA into the extracellular compartment. The mature, secreted MIA consists of 107 amino acids and its MW is approximately 11 kDa. Preliminary structural data suggests that MIA is a small globular protein stabilized by two intramolecular disulfide bonds. Expression studies of protein und mRNA levels indicate that MIA is expressed specifically by malignant melanoma cells and chondrocytes. This points to a highly restricted expression pattern which is controlled by the MIA promoter. In addition, MIA provides a clinically useful parameter in patients with malignant melanoma. Enhanced values were measured in the serum of all patients with metastatic melanoma (stage III and IV). In vitro and in vivo experiments using recombinant MIA protein revealed that MIA specifically inhibits attachment of melanoma cells to fibronectin and laminin. Further analysis indicated a direct binding between MIA and the matrix proteins. This finding provides an explanation for the capability of MIA to inhibit proliferation of melanoma cells in vitro. Our studies suggest a putative function of MIA in regulated detachment of melanoma cells from the extracellular matrix which is an important step in metastasis.",

Several lines of evidence support the view that p16INK4a and p19ARF exert the tumor-suppressor activities of this locus, although their relative importance in specific cancer types such as melanoma has been less rigorously documented on the genetic level. Here, we exploit a well-defined mouse model of RAS-induced melanomas to examine the impact of germline p16INK4a or p19ARF nullizygosity on melanoma formation. We demonstrate that loss of either Ink4a/Arf product can cooperate with RAS activation to produce clinically indistinguishable melanomas. In line with the common phenotypic end point, we further show that RAS+ p16INK4a-/- melanomas sustain somatic inactivation of p19ARF-p53 and, correspondingly, that RAS+ p19ARF-/- melanomas experience high-frequency loss of p16INK4a.

In order to understand the basis for this difference, the levels of the sialyltransferase that converts GM3 to GD3 (CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid:GM3 sialyltransferase or GD3 synthase, EC 2.4.99.8) were analyzed in melanoma and other cell lines. Enzyme levels were determined in vitro using membrane preparations and measuring the addition of [14C]-N-acetylneuraminic acid from CMP-[14C]-N-acetylneuraminic acid to GM3 in the presence of Triton CF-54. Sialyltransferase levels in 44 human cancer cell lines (including melanoma, neuroblastoma, astrocytoma, various carcinomas, and leukemias) and cultures of normal melanocytes and kidney epithelial cells were compared, and the products were identified by thin layer chromatography and fluorography. Melanoma cell lines exhibited the highest levels of incorporation and GD3 was found to be the major product. GM3 was also formed, apparently from endogenous lactosylceramide. Very low levels of GD3 synthase were found in normal melanocytes. Neuroblastoma and some astrocytoma cell lines also had significant levels of GD3 synthase. Some other cell lines incorporated high levels of radioactivity but the products did not correspond to GD3 and the major product was usually GM3. In general the levels of GD3 synthase correlated with the expression of GD3 in the various cell types. These results point to higher levels of GD3 synthase being directly responsible for the enhanced expression of GD3 in melanoma.",

Here, we describe the first case of paraneoplastic SSc secondary to a primarily diagnosed melanoma. Two months after diagnosis of metastatic melanoma, a 40-year-old female presented with high serum titers of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), but no symptoms of autoimmune disease. Five months later, the onset of Raynaud's phenomenon together with highly positive Jo-1 antibodies was observed. The following clinical course of scleroderma was correlated to melanoma remission and progression. Finally, the patient developed severe pulmonary fibrosis, massive pleural effusion, severe thoracic scleroderma and necrosis of the fingertips, simultaneously with a progression of melanoma to disseminated lymph node metastases and a small brain metastasis. This rare case of SSc concurrent with melanoma suggests that besides other possible mechanisms, paraneoplastic etiology can be responsible for the association between SSc and cancer.",

Polyunsaturated fatty acids were also increased in the latter group. The results indicate that in melanoma cells and in a percentage of normal melanocytes from melanoma patients, an imbalance in the antioxidant system can be detected that can lead to endogenous generation of reactive oxygen species and to cellular incapability of coping with exogenous peroxidative attacks.

A possible approach to more effective therapy is induction of p53-dependent apoptosis. This approach is promising, since the wild-type p53 is expressed in most melanomas. An attempt was made to estimate the functional activity of p53 in several malignant melanoma cell lines. Most lines were characterized by a high protein level and nuclear localization of p53. All cell lines expressing the wild-type p53 showed stabilization of p53, its translocation into the nucleus, and activation of several target genes in response to DNA-damaging agents, suggesting that p53 was functionally active. A high-molecular-weight protein localized in the cytoplasm and mimicking a p53 epitope was found in several cell lines. It was shown that the DO-1 epitope of this protein does not derive from p53, ruling out cytoplasmic retention of p53 in melanoma cell lines. A mechanism of camptothecin-induced stabilization of p53 by decreasing the level of the HDM2 mRNA was described for melanoma cells but not for normal melanocytes, which suggested a differential effect of camptothecin on tumor-derived and primary cells.",

In this study, the serum L-dopa/L-tyrosine ratio was compared with serum S100B as a reference marker. A total of 89 melanoma patients were sampled and staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification. Of these, 19 stage III and 28 stage IV patients were evaluated for disease progression at 1.5 years and 6 months post-sampling, respectively. Serum L-dopa and L-tyrosine were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (normal value for ratio < 16 x 10(-5)) and S100B using the LIA-mat Sangtec 100 assay (normal value < 0.10 microg/l). Non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance, Dunn's and Spearman) were used for the statistical analysis. The median serum L-dopa/L-tyrosine ratio was 16.0 x 10(-5) (range 2.7-545.1 x 10-5 and the median S100B level was 0.15 microg/l (range < 0.10-13.8 microg/l), with a sensitivity of 51% for the ratio and 66% for S100B. There was a 47% discordance and no correlation between the two markers (r = 0.149). The ratio was higher in stage IV than in other stages (P < 0.05), as was the S100B level (P < 0.0001). Both markers were higher in patients with evolutive disease (n = 23) than in stable patients (n = 24), with values of 20.8 x 10(-5) versus 13.1 x 10(-5) for the ratio (P < 0.05) and 0.89 microg/l versus 0.16 microg/l for S100B (P < 0.001); for the ratio, this difference was more pronounced in stage III than in stage IV patients. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the markers to predict disease progression were 78% and 67%, respectively, for the ratio, and 74% and 83%, respectively, for S100B (using an ROC cut-off of 0.38 microg/l).

SOX9 is methylated and lowly expressed in the highly proliferative group. SOX9 overexpression results in decreased proliferation but increased invasion in vitro. In a B16 mouse model, sox9 overexpression increases the number of lung metastases. Transcriptional analysis of SOX9-overexpressing melanoma cells reveals enrichment in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways. Survival analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas melanoma dataset shows that metastatic patients with high expression levels of SOX9 have significantly worse survival rates.

Patients with early tumor progression had lower expression levels of MIA than patients with late progression, and the expression level of MIA was inversely related to time to progression.

Lymphocyte migration from blood into peripheral tissues is mainly regulated by vascular endothelium. However, the blood vessels and mechanisms governing the recruitment of TILs in melanoma tumors remain poorly understood. Here, we show that high endothelial venules (HEVs), specialized blood vessels for lymphocyte extravasation into lymphoid tissues, are frequently found in melanoma tumors and are associated with high levels of lymphocyte infiltration. The analysis of 225 primary melanomas revealed that lymphocytes specifically infiltrated HEV-rich areas of melanoma tumors and that the density of MECA-79+ HEVs was variable among patients and strongly correlated with CD3+, CD8+ and CD20+ TIL densities. Inflammatory (CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11) and lymphoid (CCL21, CCL19 and CXCL13) chemokines as well as TH1 and naïve T-cell genes were overexpressed in melanoma samples with high densities of tumor HEVs. Mature dendritic cells (mDCs) were frequently found around tumor HEVs and densities of HEVs and DC-LAMP+ mDCs within tumor stroma were strongly correlated. DCs which maintain HEVs in lymph nodes, may thus also contribute to the regulation of HEVs in melanomas. Finally, we found significantly higher densities of tumor HEVs in melanomas with tumor regression, low Clark level of invasion and thin Breslow thickness (all p < 0.001). The strong association between tumor HEVs, TILs, mDCs and clinical parameters of melanoma, supports a critical role for HEVs in limiting malignant melanoma development through both naïve and effector T-lymphocyte recruitment and activation.",

The new system identifies significant prognostic variables in patients with melanoma and validates them in an analysis of 17,600 patients, making it possible to precisely determine the patient's chance for survival In light of physicians' ability to determine with more precision which patients are at high risk for melanoma recurrence, they face the dilemma of which, if any, surgical adjuvant therapy to choose. Alpha-interferon is the only agent approved for adjuvant therapy of melanoma in the United States, but its questionable benefits and substantial side effects make it hard to justify recommending it to patients. Discussion of trials of high- and low-dose interferon is presented here. The author's group has conducted trials of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF [Leukine]) as surgical adjuvant treatment of patients at high-risk for melanoma recurrence. One of the most important activities of GM-CSF is its ability to activate macrophages and cause them to become cytotoxic for human melanoma cells, at doses low enough to avoid the toxicity associated with other cytokines. The author presents promising trial results, discusses GM-CSF in other malignancies, and includes discussion of tumor vaccines, biochemotherapy, and other agents being studied as adjuvant therapy of melanoma. It is hoped that these newer approaches will result in therapies that are more effective and less toxic than interferon.",

Vaccine injection site biopsies and additional blood samples were obtained 2 days after the 1st and 4th vaccines.;Among 20 treated patients, 18 completed 4 vaccinations. Minimal treatment-related toxicity was observed. One patient developed vitiligo and patches of white hair during the treatment and follow-up period. Vaccine site biopsies demonstrated complex inflammatory infiltrates, including significant increases in eosinophils and PD-1+ lymphocytes from cycle 1 to cycle 4 (P < 0.05). Serum GM-CSF concentrations increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner 48 h after vaccination (P = 0.0086), accompanied by increased numbers of activated circulating monocytes (P < 0.0001) and decreased percentages of myeloid-derived suppressor cells among monocytes (CD14+ , CD11b+ , HLA-DR low or negative; P = 0.002). Cyclophosphamide did not affect numbers of circulating Tregs. No significant changes in anti-melanoma immunity were observed in peripheral T cells by interferon-gamma ELIPSOT, or immunoglobulins by serum Western blotting.;Melanoma GVAX was safe and tolerable in the adjuvant setting. Pharmacodynamic testing revealed complex vaccine site immune infiltrates and an immune-reactive profile in circulating monocytic cell subsets.

For comparison, a highly metastatic melanoma cell line (Queen's) that constitutively expresses high tPA production, was transfected with a cDNA coding for human plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). Unlike non-transfected controls, transfected D5.1G4 melanoma cells expressed high levels of tPA and produced extensive pulmonary metastases following intravenous injection. By contrast, PAI-1 transfected Queen's melanoma cells expressed low tPA activity and displayed significantly reduced metastatic potential compared with nontransfected controls. Moreover, PAI-1 transfected Queen's melanoma cells did not metastasize from the eye while nontransfected parental cells produced extensive spontaneous metastases. Expression of tPA activity in transfected and nontransfected cell lines was completely blocked by an anti-tPA antibody. This antibody significantly inhibited the organ localization and frequency of lung metastases of both Queen's and tPA-transfected D5.1G4 melanomas.

Cells with high basal tyrosinase activity had high levels of newly synthesized tyrosinase. Cells with low tyrosinase activity synthesized less tyrosinase and degraded the enzyme at a faster rate than cells with high tyrosinase activity. Melanotropin (melanocyte stimulating hormone), dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate, and isobutylmethylxanthine caused an increase in the abundance of newly synthesized tyrosinase that was directly proportional to the increase in enzyme activity.

In the present study, patients registered from 1997 to 2001 (group C) were investigated and the data were compared with findings obtained by the subsequent follow-up of groups A and B.;The numbers of melanoma patients registered were: 545 in group A (1987-1991), 699 in group B (1992-1996), and 821 in group C (1997-2001). Because the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) TNM and stage classifications for malignant melanoma were changed substantially in 2002, analyses in the present investigation were performed according to the new classifications. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to draw survival curves, and the log-rank test was used to assess the significance of differences in survival. In addition, the numbers of patients with various kinds of skin malignancies, including not only malignant melanoma but also basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, mycosis fungoides, actinic keratosis, Bowen's disease, and Paget's disease, registered at approximately 100 medical institutions in Japan from 1987 to 2001, were also investigated and data were tabulated.;The nationwide survey of Japanese patients with malignant skin tumors from 1987 to 2001 showed that the most prevalent skin tumor was basal cell carcinoma, which increased year by year, followed by squamous cell carcinoma, and then by malignant melanoma. The following results were obtained from the data for melanoma patients registered at major institutions from 1987 to 2001. (1) The overall 10-year survival rates for melanoma patients in each chronological group were ranked as: group C > B > A, although only the difference between groups C and A was statistically significant. (2) The male-to-female ratio ranged from 1: 0.97 to 1: 1.14, and the survival rate of female patients was higher than that of male patients (the 140-month survival rate was 70.6% in females and 60% in males). (3) Assessment of the age distribution showed that the number of patients increased rapidly from ages 40-49 years and reached a peak at around 60 years in all three groups. (4) The sole of the foot was the most common site of melanoma in both males and females, while melanomas on the lower limbs were also prevalent in females. (5) Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) was the most common type in all three groups, accounting for nearly 50% of the patients in each group. The number of patients with superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) increased steadily over time and exceeded the number of patients with nodular melanoma (NM) in group C. The prognosis of NM was the worst, while that of SSM was the most favorable. (6) The proportion of stage I patients was larger in group C than in groups A and B, but no significant difference among the groups was observed in the proportions of stage II, III, and IV patients. For patients in stage III, the overall survival rate was higher in group C than that in group A or B, while there was no apparent difference in survival between the groups for patients in stage I or II. For patients in stage IV, the survival rate in group C was slightly lower than that in group A or B. (7) In group C, the overall survival rates for substages III A, B, and C were ranked as III A > III B > III C. (8) The overall survival rates for stage IV M1a, M1b, and M1c were ranked as M1a > M1b > M1c. In group C, the overall survival rate of stage IV patients with a normal serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level was higher than that of patients with elevated LDH values. (9) Evaluation of the effects of some therapeutic procedures (prophylactic lymph node dissection and chemotherapy with and without interferon-beta) on the survivals of patients with melanoma was inconclusive and suggested the need for more studies in this area.;In Japan, the number of patients with malignant skin tumors has increased year by year. The prognosis of patients with advanced malignant melanoma remains extremely poor, but that of patients in stage III has shown an improvement."},

In order to improve the probability of establishing melanoma cell lines, we compared two FCS-free media with the original FCS medium. Ten melanoma-invaded lymph nodes were tested for their ability to grow in three different culture media: RPMI with FCS; RPMI with human serum (HS); serum-free X-vivo 15 (X15). For each medium, we compared the following criteria: percentage of lines obtained; period of establishment; cell morphology; expression of melanoma-associated antigens and surface molecules. More cell lines were obtained with HS and X15 media compared to FCS medium (7/10, 5/10 and 4/10, respectively). The time period to establish a stable line was similar for the three media. No morphological differences were observed in cells derived from the same tumor sample in the different media. With the X15 medium, cells generally expressed lower levels of melanocytic differentiation antigens and surface molecules. The growth of melanoma cell lines in FCS-free culture media appears possible and advantageous, with an increased probability of obtaining autologous tumor cell lines.

Moreover, a long-term production and accumulation of inflammatory factors lead to a local and systemic immunosuppression associated with cancer progression. However, the correlation between inflammatory mediators, immunosuppressive cells and the clinical outcome of malignant melanoma patients was poorly investigated. In this study, we performed a complex analysis of various inflammatory factors, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the peripheral blood of patients suffering from malignant melanoma of different stages. We demonstrated that levels of serum IL-1β, IFN-γ and CXCL10 were significantly increased in advanced melanoma patients. In addition, these factors were found to be associated with an increased frequency of MDSCs and Tregs as compared to age- and gender-matched healthy donors. Importantly, advanced melanoma patients with signs of progression displayed markedly elevated concentrations of IL-1β and CXCL10 as compared to patients with stable disease. Moreover, an enrichment of circulating monocytic (Mo)-MDSCs significantly correlated with a decreased progression free survival of these patients. Our data highlight a complex association between circulating inflammatory mediators, Mo-MDSCs and the clinical outcome as well as suggest that their levels in patients with advanced melanoma are of important prognostic value allowing the identification of those with high risk of disease progression.

In contrast, the 100 K MAA, which is present in spent medium of cultured human melanoma, carcinoma and fetal melanocytes but not of adult normal cells, was found in normal human serum in nanogram quantities. This serum form of the 100 K MAA was also found in pooled sera of higher apes but not of lower species. The cell-derived form of the 100 K MAA, present in spent culture medium, had a similar phylogenetic distribution. The molecule was produced by cultured brain glia from gorilla, but not by melanoma cells from miniature swine or dog. The 100 K MAA from gorilla glia had a mol. wt identical to the molecule produced by human melanoma cells.

The 100 K MAA was dissociated from albumin in normal human serum by treatment with SDS and fractionation by gel sieving. Under these conditions 100 K MAA from serum co-migrated with similarly treated 100 K from melanoma cells.

However, the clinical significance of high MIF expression in melanoma has not been reported.;MIF expression was depleted in human melanoma cell lines using siRNA-mediated gene knockdown and effects monitored using in vitro assays of proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, clonogenicity and Akt signalling. In silico analyses of expression microarray data were used to correlate MIF expression levels in melanoma tumours with overall patient survival using a univariate Cox regression model.;Knockdown of MIF significantly decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis and decreased anchorage-independent growth. Effects were associated with reduced numbers of cells entering S phase concomitant with decreased cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression, increased p27 expression and decreased Akt phosphorylation. Analysis of clinical outcome data showed that MIF expression levels in primary melanoma were not associated with outcome (HR = 1.091, p = 0.892) whereas higher levels of MIF in metastatic lesions were significantly associated with faster disease progression (HR = 2.946, p = 0.003 and HR = 4.600, p = 0.004, respectively in two independent studies).;Our in vitro analyses show that MIF functions upstream of the PI3K/Akt pathway in human melanoma cell lines. Moreover, depletion of MIF inhibited melanoma proliferation, viability and clonogenic capacity.

These findings support the clinical significance of MIF signalling in melanoma and provide a strong rationale for both targeting and monitoring MIF expression in clinical melanoma.",

Selected lymphangiogenic clones were then grafted into severe combined immunodeficient mice, where they induced lymphangiogenesis and metastasized into sentinel nodes, whereas non-lymphangiogenic clones from the same patient did not metastasize.

Screening of a set of independently isolated melanoma cell lines from other patients confirmed this association between expression of high levels of MET and of VEGF-C and PDGF-C. Hence, we provide a model to screen for the lymphangiogenic potential of tumor cells.

PGC1α is a transcriptional coactivator that promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, protects against oxidative stress and reprograms melanoma metabolism to influence drug sensitivity and survival. Here, we provide data indicating that PGC1α suppresses melanoma metastasis, acting through a pathway distinct from that of its bioenergetic functions. Elevated PGC1α expression inversely correlates with vertical growth in human melanoma specimens. PGC1α silencing makes poorly metastatic melanoma cells highly invasive and, conversely, PGC1α reconstitution suppresses metastasis. Within populations of melanoma cells, there is a marked heterogeneity in PGC1α levels, which predicts their inherent high or low metastatic capacity. Mechanistically, PGC1α directly increases transcription of ID2, which in turn binds to and inactivates the transcription factor TCF4. Inactive TCF4 causes downregulation of metastasis-related genes, including integrins that are known to influence invasion and metastasis. Inhibition of BRAF",

Other high-risk susceptibility genes are being sought actively. Genetic epidemiologic studies suggest that penetrance of each of the two identified genes is altered by other factors, either genetic or environmental. Epidemiologic studies have also identified other major host factors important in the development of melanoma. In European, North American, and Australian populations, the presence of clinically identified dysplastic nevi confers greatly increased risk of melanoma. A new measure of sun exposure, based on individual residential history, confers substantially increased risk of melanoma.

Interferon-alpha has an approximately 16% response rate in metastatic melanoma. In the randomised trials to date, no combination of chemotherapeutic or hormonal agent with interferon-alpha has proven to be superior to dacarbazine, the reference agent for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. The role of interferon-alpha-2b in the adjuvant therapy of localised melanoma at high risk for relapse has recently been established, with the results of 2 large randomised trials conducted by the US Intergroup, one showing improvement in both relapse-free survival and overall survival, and the other in relapse-free survival only.

Median survival times for dogs with oral melanoma treated with surgery are approximately 17 to 18, 5 to 6, and 3 months with stage I, II, and III disease, respectively. Significant negative prognostic factors include stage, size, evidence of metastasis, and a variety of histologic criteria. Standardized treatments such as surgery, coarse-fractionation radiation therapy, and chemotherapy have afforded minimal to modest stage-dependent clinical benefits and death is usually due to systemic metastasis.

The need for routine clinical biomarkers to follow disease progression and treatment efficacy is high. The aim of the present study was to build a protein sequence database in metastatic melanoma, searching for novel, relevant biomarkers. Ten lymph node metastases (South-Swedish Malignant Melanoma Biobank) were subjected to global protein expression analysis using two proteomics approaches (with/without orthogonal fractionation). Fractionation produced higher numbers of protein identifications (4284). Combining both methods, 5326 unique proteins were identified (2641 proteins overlapping). Deep mining proteomics may contribute to the discovery of novel biomarkers for metastatic melanoma, for example dividing the samples into two metastatic melanoma \"genomic subtypes\", (\"pigmentation\" and \"high immune\") revealed several proteins showing differential levels of expression. In conclusion, the present study provides an initial version of a metastatic melanoma protein sequence database producing a total of more than 5000 unique protein identifications.

Local targeted alpha therapy (TAT) via intralesional injections of activities in the range 12.5-200 microCi shows a very high level of inhibition of tumorigenesis and regression of tumours. Results show that isolated cancer cells and preangiogenic cell clusters can be eliminated by local TAT, and that intralesional injections of 100 microCi of AIC are sufficient to cause complete regression of melanomas with volumes up to 300 mm3 without any observed side effects. Systemic TAT was less effective, with all tumours experiencing growth delay and limited inhibition of tumour growth.

It is estimated that 68, 130 cases of invasive malignant melanoma and at least 48,000 cases of melanoma in-situ will be diagnosed in the US this year. Melanoma is also one of the few remaining cancers with increasing US incidence. In the 1930s, the lifetime risk of an American developing invasive malignant melanoma was 1 in 1,500. Currently, that risk is 1 in 59. Deaths from malignant melanoma are also increasing. The mortality rate from malignant melanoma has risen about 2% annually since 1960. This year, it is estimated that 8,700 Americans will die from this cancer. The identification of individuals at high risk for malignant melanoma is important for the development of focused and efficient prevention efforts. Acute sun exposure resulting in sunburn remains a significant risk factor for the development of melanoma, but numerous other potential risk factors have been cited. Included among these are atypical mole syndrome/dysplastic nevus syndrome, blistering sunburns, immunosuppression, prior therapy with psoralen with ultraviolet A light (UVA) light, UV exposure at tanning salons, elevated socioeconomic status, and history of melanoma in a first-degree relative. With a better understanding of the reasons for the increasing rate of this cancer, and with enhanced early detection approaches, we may be able to decrease the incidence and mortality of malignant melanoma.",

Local tumor control of uveal melanoma is excellent, yet this malignancy is associated with relatively high mortality secondary to metastasis. Various clinical, histopathological, cytogenetic features and gene expression features help in estimating the prognosis of uveal melanoma. The clinical features associated with poor prognosis in patients with uveal melanoma include older age at presentation, male gender, larger tumor basal diameter and thickness, ciliary body location, diffuse tumor configuration, association with ocular/oculodermal melanocytosis, extraocular tumor extension, and advanced tumor staging by American Joint Committee on Cancer classification. Histopathological features suggestive of poor prognosis include epithelioid cell type, high mitotic activity, higher values of mean diameter of ten largest nucleoli, higher microvascular density, extravascular matrix patterns, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, tumor-infiltrating macrophages, higher expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, and higher expression of human leukocyte antigen Class I and II. Monosomy 3, 1p loss, 6q loss, and 8q and those classified as Class II by gene expression are predictive of poor prognosis of uveal melanoma.

By monitoring sCEACAM1 in serum samples obtained prior to and after vaccination, we show that sCEACAM1 correlates with disease state, overall survival, and S100B. The trend of change in sCEACAM1 following vaccination (increase/decrease) inversely correlates with overall survival. DTH skin test is used to evaluate patients' anti-melanoma immune response and to predict response to vaccination.

To test the hypothesis that an MGSA autocrine loop is responsible for the partial freedom from growth control observed in nevocytes and melanoma cells, MGSA growth response and MGSA mRNA/protein levels were examined in these cells compared with normal melanocytes. As a single agent, or in combination with other factors, MGSA stimulated the growth of normal human epidermal melanocytes as well as other growth promoters for melanocytes. Nevocytes were not as responsive to exogenous MGSA as melanocytes. MGSA mRNA was minimal or not detected in cultured normal melanocytes, although the protein was present when the cells were cultured in the presence of serum/growth factors and absent when serum/growth factors were omitted. In contrast, MGSA mRNA was constitutively expressed in the absence of exogenous growth factors in cultures established from benign intradermal and dysplastic nevi and melanoma lesions in different stages of tumor progression. Nevus cultures contained immunoreactive MGSA protein in the presence of serum but were negative or only faintly positive in the absence of serum. Melanoma cell lines were positive for MGSA protein in both the presence and the absence of serum.

Vulvar melanomas are mostly located at the labia minora.

There is no typical histopathological pattern, but mostly melanomas of this site are of the mucosal-lentiginous type. As treatment modalities, most investigators propose a complete excision for melanomas thinner than 1 mm, and for thicker melanomas a wide excision. Recent investigations have shown that hemivulvectomies or vulvectomies do not show a better survival. The question of a prophylactic ipsilateral lymph node dissection is not answered yet. The survival rates depend on the tumor thickness and/or the infiltration level. The importance of an early diagnosis should be stressed in vulvar melanomas, especially through an accurate inspection of the vulva at the time of a genital examination.

After 6 - 10 days the cell numbers in chambers from immunized hosts slowly increased in spite of a high level of cytotoxicity in ther serum of the animals. The same pattern was seen after previous immunization with hamster lymphocytes, indicating that the antibodies were directed against a common antigen for melanoma cells and lymphocytes in hamsters.

Here we show that melanoma cells exhibit an oxidative stress phenotype compared with normal melanocytes, as evidenced by increased total cellular ROS, KEAP1/NRF2 pathway activity, protein damage, and elevated oxidized glutathione. Our overall objective was to test whether augmenting this high oxidative stress level in melanoma cells would inhibit their dependence on oncogenic PI3K/AKT/mTOR-mediated survival. We report that NexrutineR augmented the constitutively elevated oxidative stress markers in melanoma cells, which was abrogated by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) pre-treatment. NexrutineR disrupted growth homeostasis by inhibiting proliferation, survival, and colony formation in melanoma cells without affecting melanocyte cell viability. Increased oxidative stress in melanoma cells inhibited PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway through disruption of mTORC1 formation and phosphorylation of downstream targets p70S6K, 4EBP1 and rpS6. NAC pre-treatment reversed inhibition of mTORC1 targets, demonstrating a ROS-dependent mechanism. Overall, our results illustrate the importance of disruption of the intrinsically high oxidative stress in melanoma cells to selectively inhibit their survival mediated by PI3K/AKT/mTOR. ",

Interferon (IFN) is commonly used in patients with melanoma who remain at high risk for relapse following surgery; however, the optimal scheduling and dose are not agreed upon. Pegylation of IFN involves conjugation with polyethylene glycol. Following subcutaneous injection of pegIFN, the rate of absorption, renal and cellular clearance, and immunogenicity are reduced. As a result of the extended serum half-life, once-weekly administration is feasible, compared with the daily and/or thrice weekly dosing of IFN. When compared with observation alone in patients with resected stage III melanoma, pegIFN demonstrated a significant increase in relapse-free survival, with a marginal impact on overall survival. The most common adverse events were as expected with IFN and included fatigue, increased liver enzymes, pyrexia, headache, anorexia, myalgia, nausea, chills, depression, and injection site reactions. A large Phase 3 study is underway to further assess outcome and toxicity differences between pegIFN weekly and low-dose IFN thrice weekly.;PegIFN is a modified version of the previously approved interferon indicated for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma. Although the safety profile remains similar between the pegylated and non-pegylated forms, once-weekly administration is feasible secondary to an extended serum half-life and may have improved convenience for the patient.",

These findings and new information about antigen recognition by human T-cells have made it possible to explore the use of peptide epitopes targeted at T-cells as melanoma vaccines. Preliminary results are encouraging and suggest that it may soon be possible to use well defined vaccines, selected on the basis of the antigenic phenotype of the patient's melanoma and their HLA status. Equally exciting advances have been made preparing and using recombinant viral vectors containing genes that code for melanoma antigens. Experimental studies on the use of naked DNA as vaccines are also proceeding. Several fundamental obstacles preventing the effective use of T-cell epitope vaccines remain. These include selection of HLA and tumour antigen loss variants by the immune system, and conditioning of an ineffective immune response by the growing tumour. These aspects suggest that the development of effective vaccine therapy in the future may require a combination of strategies designed to stimulate HLA-restricted and -non-restricted effector cells, and judicious use of cytokines to obtain an effective immune response.",

In the present study we investigated whether AVPs carrying cyclic peptides with an RGD integrin binding motif (RGD-AVPs) are suitable for the specific and efficient transduction of human melanoma cells.;Plasmid DNA was complexed with low molecular weight non-linear polyethyleneimine and packaged into anionic liposomes.

Efficient transduction was clearly dependent on the presence of the cyclic RGD ligand and was selective for melanoma cells. The specificity of the vector system could be further enhanced by using the melanocyte-specific tyrosinase promoter to drive transgene expression.;Our findings suggest that the AVP technology is a useful approach for generating highly efficient and specific non-viral vectors for melanoma targeting, in particular in a setting of combined transductional and transcriptional targeting.",

Tumour resistance to CENU is known to be mainly due to a DNA repair protein, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). The poor remission rate of melanoma with CENUs is attributed to the fact that metastases contain high MGMT levels. Previously, we have shown that O6-benzyl-N2-acetylguanosine (BNAG), an MGMT inhibitor, can be combined with cystemustine by intravenous administration, and increases the antitumour effect of cystemustine in resistant human melanoma. In the work presented here, we investigated the in vitro pharmacological effect of this combination on the DNA of human melanoma cells (M3Dau cells). A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) assay was used to measure DNA damage in a fragment (2.7 kb) of the hprt gene.

This topic is timely, given the lengthy list of immune checkpoint inhibitors and vaccine formulations in development for melanoma.;The discovery of immune checkpoint proteins like CTLA-4, PD-1 and CD40 and the development of antibodies and small molecules that either inhibit or promote their activity has lent a huge impetus to the immunotherapy of melanoma. The development of vaccines that include agonists of various immune signaling like the MAGE-3 ASCI has also revived the field of cancer vaccines. Melanoma is the 'poster child' for immunotherapy of cancer, since a recent randomized phase III trial showed a survival benefit for immunotherapy.;The burgeoning field of immunotherapy for melanoma has important implications for clinicians, and for the novel paradigms of treatment and response assessment that immunotherapies will promote. The unique side-effect profile for immune checkpoint inhibitors will be a challenge but new skills for dealing with them in community based practice will be learned.

Interestingly, a melanoma-secreted form of CEACAM1 (sCEACAM1) has recently emerged as a potential tumor biomarker. Here we add novel evidences supporting the prognostic role of serum CEACAM1 by using a mice xenograft model of human melanoma and showing a correlation between serum CEACAM1 and tumor burden. Moreover, we demonstrate that serum CEACAM1 is elevated over time in progressive melanoma patients who fail to respond to immunotherapy as opposed to responders and stable disease patients, thus proving a correlation between sCEACAM1, response to treatment, and clinical deterioration.

The surface molecules which mediate these processes therefore play an important role in regulating melanoma dissemination and their level of expression may alter during the course of tumor progression. Human melanocyte strains and melanoma cell lines have been characterised with regard to levels of cell surface receptors of the integrin family. Increased amounts of at least two integrins, VLA-4 (alpha 4 beta 1) and VnR (alpha v beta 3), appeared to correlate with progression in this tumor, type. A novel VnR composed of an alpha v beta 1 association has been observed in one melanoma cell line and there is the possibility that heterogeneity of integrin composition could affect biological behavior of these tumors. CD44, a cell surface glycoprotein which functions as the major receptor for hyaluronate, is another molecule whose expression increases in transformed cells of the melanocytic lineage. Iterative sorting on the FACS for stable variants, of both human and murine melanomas, expressing low and high levels of CD44 established that lack of expression of this molecule correlated with impaired ability to form pulmonary tumor nodules subsequent to i.v. injection into appropriate recipient mice. These findings illustrate that an understanding of the regulation of melanoma adhesion receptors could provide insights into the process of tumor spread.",

Currently, its mechanism of action is uncharacterized. Low-dose IFN-alpha exerts anti-angiogenic effects when used in the treatment of life-threatening hemangiomas of infancy, suggesting anti-angiogenesis as a mechanism of action. IFN-alpha may exert its anti-tumor effect in the setting of advanced malignancy by inhibiting the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a pro-angiogenic substance. We hypothesized that IFN-alpha would decrease the release of VEGF by melanoma tumors. We studied the effect of IFN-alpha on VEGF production in nine human melanoma cell lines. We also examined VEGF levels in 49 patients with advanced malignancies who received low-dose IFN-alpha and interleukin-12 (IL-12) on an NCI-sponsored phase I trial. Human melanoma cell lines produced varying amounts of VEGF in vitro (60-1500 pg/mL at 48 h). Certain melanoma cell lines such as 18105 MEL secreted low levels of VEGF (152 pg/mL) after 48 h of culture, whereas other lines secreted very high levels (FO-1 3,802 pg/mL). Treatment of melanoma cells with IFN-alpha (2000 U/mL) decreased VEGF secretion by 40-60% in VEGF-high cell lines; however, this effect was not demonstrated in VEGF-low cell lines. In cancer patients, pretreatment VEGF plasma levels varied from 471 to 4200 pg/mL. A decrease in VEGF plasma levels after treatment directly correlated with the number of treatment cycles administered (Pearson correlation, p = 0.04). In summary, IFN-alpha inhibits VEGF secretion by melanoma cell lines in vitro and may have similar actions in malignancies that respond to IFN-alpha treatment.",

A minority of thick human primary melanomas had high DUSP6 expression and the same poor melanoma-specific survival as the majority of thick primaries with low DUSP6 levels.

Risk also varies with pigmentation, family history of melanoma, and the presence of benign and of dysplastic nevi. The following methods of control of melanoma in such populations are discussed: the most effective methods depend on early diagnosis; primary prevention appears difficult and requires evaluation; identification of very high-risk subjects on the basis of family history and dysplastic nevi will affect only a very small proportion of melanomas; the use of simpler methods to identify high-risk subjects is explored. In Japan, melanoma is comparatively rare, but increasing as rapidly as elsewhere.

Because melanoma is typically refractory to available anticancer therapy, exploration of preventive strategies has become a priority. In this review, the rationale for chemoprevention, a new and potentially powerful approach to controlling melanoma, is discussed. Chemoprevention success is based on the principles that ultraviolet-induced melanoma is a multistep process, and that molecular events and pathways associated with these steps can be targeted. Early studies using genetically engineered mice have begun to identify a number of relevant molecular pathways in melanoma. For example, Ras signaling pathways comprise all melanoma-related alterations in N-Ras, B-RAF, MAPK/ERK, and Rho proteins, and thus provide a host of potential molecular targets for melanoma chemoprevention. Among the available prospects, the statins, which inhibit Ras and Rho, have shown much promise as chemoprevention agents. However, thorough evaluation of chemoprevention candidates will require the identification of surrogate biomarkers for risk and molecular targets for intervention, as well as high-risk groups in which to focus clinical studies. We anticipate that melanoma chemoprevention research will progress in step with advances in genomics, proteomics, and preclinical mouse modeling, and ultimately provide us with powerful weapons in our struggle to control this escalating, often fatal disease.",

Although a number of targeted therapies are available, they are effective only in a subset of patients and the emergence of drug resistance often reduces durable responses. Thus there is an urgent need to identify new therapeutic targets and develop more potent pharmacological agents for melanoma treatment. Herein we report that SHP2 levels are frequently elevated in melanoma, and high SHP2 expression is significantly associated with more metastatic phenotype and poorer prognosis. We show that SHP2 promotes melanoma cell viability, motility, and anchorage-independent growth, through activation of both ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways. We demonstrate that SHP2 inhibitor 11a-1 effectively blocks SHP2-mediated ERK1/2 and AKT activation and attenuates melanoma cell viability, migration and colony formation. Most importantly, SHP2 inhibitor 11a-1 suppresses xenografted melanoma tumor growth, as a result of reduced tumor cell proliferation and enhanced tumor cell apoptosis. Taken together, our data reveal SHP2 as a novel target for melanoma and suggest SHP2 inhibitors as potential novel therapeutic agents for melanoma treatment.",

It acts through binding to high-affinity receptors of the melanocortin-1 subtype, exclusively expressed in cells of the melanocytic lineage. Elevated levels of immunoreactive alpha-melanotropin were previously reported in melanoma cell lines, tumours and plasma from patients with melanoma. Here, we show that this high ectopic production of melanotropin is restricted to melanoma and non-pituitary tumours with the same neuroectodermic origin. The occurrence of a melanotropin-specific autocrine loop was further investigated in human melanoma cells. Immunoreactive alpha-melanotropin was spontaneously released from a melanoma cell line (HBL) expressing melanotropin receptors on the cell surface. This release was significantly increased in the presence of melanotropin-related peptides such as corticotropin-(4-10)-peptide and beta-melanotropin, competing for binding to the melanotropin receptor and was directly correlated to the displacement potential of these peptides. Both spontaneous and induced releases of immunoreactive alpha-melanotropin could be blocked at low temperatures, suggesting the involvement of intracellular protein movement in the release mechanism. The release of immunoreactive alpha-melanotropin was not significant in melanoma cells expressing very low levels of melanotropin receptors (IGR3) or in non-melanoma cells (SCC1). However, upon expression of the melanocortin-1 receptor cDNA into IGR3 cells, spontaneous and competition-induced releases of immunoreactive alpha-melanotropin were both increased and also blocked at low temperatures. This observation further underlines a role for the melanotropin receptor in the release of immunoreactive alpha-melanotropin. These experiments indicate that an autocrine loop between the melanocortin-1 receptor and immunoreactive alpha-melanotropin may be functional in human melanoma cells.",

Out of 2,184 melanoma cases, 684 (31.3%) had a high nevus count (>50). High nevus counts were associated with favorable prognostic factors such as lower Breslow thickness, less ulceration and lower mitotic rate, despite adjustment for age. Nevus count was not predictive of sentinel node status. The crude 5- and 10-year melanoma-specific survival rate was higher in melanomas cases with a high nevus count compared to those with a low nevus count (91.2 vs. 86.4% and 87.2 vs. 79%, respectively). The difference in survival remained significant after adjusting for all known melanoma prognostic factors (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.43, confidence interval [CI] = 0.21-0.89).

We found an important down-regulation of the protein in the melanoma cell line. Stable transfection of these cells with the cDNA coding for MARCKS led to the selection of several clones expressing variable levels of the protein. Proliferation experiments performed with four of these clones revealed that cell growth was reduced by 35-40% when compared with control cells. Upon serum starvation, cell proliferation was almost abolished when the expression level of MARCKS was high, whereas it was only partially reduced in the controls. MARCKS overexpression induced a higher percentage of cells in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle upon serum starvation, as well as the inhibition of colony formation in soft agar. Finally, the expression of the CDK inhibitor p27 was increased in the cells presenting a high level of MARCKS protein.

Superficial spreading melanomas usually are detected during the initial radial growth phase, when simple excision usually effects a cure. Nodular melanomas extend vertically from inception and often are not detected until they have penetrated to relatively deep levels. Because the possibility of recurrence is higher with deeper tumors, lymph node dissection may also be necessary. Fortunately, superficial spreading melanomas are considerably more common than the nodular type. Therefore, increased efforts at earlier detection and diagnosis of melanoma will be rewarded by increased cure rates.",

The melanoma nature of the cells growing in MoAb 225.28S coated dishes is indicated by the specific reactivity with anti-HMW-MAA MoAb, by its detection in spent culture medium and by morphological criteria. The specificity of the procedure is proven by the lack of growth of cells seeded in fetal calf serum (FCS) coated dishes, as well as of cells lacking the HMW-MAA in MoAb 225.28S coated dishes. The adherence of melanoma cells to plastic dishes is influenced by the concentration of the plastic bound MoAb 225.28S and by the incubation time. Melanoma cells isolated by adherence to MoAb 225.28S coated plates do not display any detectable change in their growth curve and colony forming ability.

The correlation between osteopontin expression and several histologic markers for melanoma was assessed by using the Chi-square test and the Le directional test. The impact of osteopontin expression on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) of patients with melanoma was examined using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses.

Four of 10 patients with multiple primaries treated with adjuvant BCG or BCG-tumor cell vaccine developed subsequent melanomas suggesting that immunotherapy with BCG will not prevent the development of a new primary melanoma. Survival in patients with Stage I and II multiple primary melanomas was improved compared to Stage I and Stage II patients with a single primary.

In adult melanoma, some chromosomal regions in 1p, 6q, 9p, 10q, and 11q are frequently deleted. Microsatellite instability (MSI), which reflects impaired DNA repair, has been found at low levels in adult melanoma and melanocytic nevi. To investigate the molecular changes in pediatric melanoma, a screening for loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite instability was performed and compared with changes found in adult melanoma. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 10 adult melanomas, 9 melanocytic nevi, and 8 pediatric melanomas were microdissected and the DNA was extracted. Loss of heterozygosity and microsatellite instability were evaluated using 13 microsatellite repeat polymorphisms located in 1p36, 1q32, 2p12, 2p22-25, 2q33-37, 9p21, 10q23.3, 11q23, 13q14, 17p13, and 17q21. The overall frequency of loss of heterozygosity was 0.09 for nevi, 0.30 for adult melanoma, and 0.43 for pediatric melanoma (nevi vs. adult melanoma, P = 0.0082; nevi vs. pediatric melanoma, P = 0.0092). Pediatric melanoma has more loss of heterozygosity (44%) in 11q23 than adult melanoma (7%, P = 0.046). The microsatellite instability overall frequency was greater in pediatric melanoma (0.24) than nevi (0.05, P = 0.0031) and adult melanoma (0.09, P = 0.0195). Our findings suggest that pediatric melanoma has a different abnormal pattern than adult melanoma. Pediatric melanoma has more microsatellite instability than adult melanoma. 11q23 could contain genes related to the early age onset of melanoma. The high frequency of microsatellite instability is coincidental with the finding of higher levels of microsatellite instability in pediatric brain tumors and could play a role in the pathogenesis of pediatric melanoma.",

The significance and practical value of this procedure for the diagnosis of tumor dissemination in melanoma patients are unclear. The conflicting results may at least partially be related to very low amounts of circulating tumor cells and to our observation that melanoma cells only transiently persist in the peripheral blood. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relevance of detection of extracellular melanoma-specific mRNA in serum and plasma samples in comparison to blood cell samples from patients with disseminated disease (stage IV). We therefore compared the presence of specific mRNA for tyrosinase, gp100, and MART-1 by RT-PCR amplification of specific cDNA from serum, plasma, and whole blood samples of 10 melanoma patients. Melanoma-specific mRNA was detectable in whole blood samples of all ten patients tested indicating the presence of circulating melanoma cells. In addition, tyrosinase mRNA could be detected in the serum and/or plasma of 6 of 10 melanoma patients whereas gp100 and MART-1 specific transcripts were not detectable in any of the samples tested. The presence and integrity of amplifiable RNA was shown in all serum and plasma samples of patients and controls by RT-PCR-specific amplification of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBDG) mRNA. We conclude that tyrosinase mRNA but not gp100 and MART-1 mRNA can be amplified from serum and/or plasma in a subset of melanoma patients showing circulating melanoma cells. Therefore, extracellular-directed assays appear to be less sensitive and efficacious in detecting melanoma-specific transcripts compared to cellular-based assays.",

In this report, we present data, which document that the DEAD-box helicase DDX11, which is required for sister chromatid cohesion, is a crucial gatekeeper for melanoma cell survival.;Performing immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analysis, we determined expression of DDX11 in melanoma tissues and cell lines. Following transfection of melanoma cells with a DDX11-specific siRNA, we conducted a qPCR analysis to determine downregulation of DDX11 in the transfected melanoma cells. In subsequent studies, which focused upon an analysis of fluorescently labeled as well as Giesma-stained chromosome spreads, a proliferation analysis and apoptosis assays, we determined the impact of suppressing DDX11 expression on melanoma cells representing advanced melanoma.;The findings of the study presented herein document that DDX11 is upregulated with progression from noninvasive to invasive melanoma, and that it is expressed at high levels in advanced melanoma. Furthermore, and equally important, we demonstrate that blocking the expression of DDX11 leads not only to inhibition of melanoma cell proliferation and severe defects in chromosome segregation, but also drives melanoma cells rapidly into massive apoptosis.;To date, little is known as to whether helicases play a role in melanoma development and specifically, in the progression from early to advanced melanoma. In this report, we show that the helicase DDX11 is expressed at high levels in primary and metastatic melanoma, and that interfering with its expression leads to severe chromosome segregation defects, telomere shortening, and massive melanoma cell apoptosis. These findings suggest that DDX11 could be an important candidate for molecular targeted therapy for advanced melanoma.",

Furthermore, the cell line was characterized by cytogenetic analysis, electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry and Northern blotting for HLA and c-myc-mRNA analysis. Cytogenetic analysis revealed numerical abnormalities of chromosome 8 and structural abnormalities of chromosome 6. By electron microscopy, different stages of melanosome development were observed. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated expression of the melanoma-associated antigen gp 100. Expression analysis of HLA antigens revealed a very low level of, in particular, the HLA-B locus products, which could be induced by interferon-alpha or -gamma treatment. Likewise, Northern-blot experiments revealed decreased levels of HLA-B mRNA as compared with HLA-A. In addition, high levels of c-myc expression were observed.

Recently, we identified GLI2, a mediator of the hedgehog pathway, as a transcriptional target of TGF-beta signaling.;We used real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting to determine GLI2 expression in human melanoma cell lines and subsequently classified them as GLI2high or as GLI2low according to their relative GLI2 mRNA and protein expression levels. GLI2 expression was reduced in a GLI2high cell line with lentiviral expression of short hairpin RNA targeting GLI2. We assessed the role of GLI2 in melanoma cell invasiveness in Matrigel assays. We measured secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 by gelatin zymography and expression of E-cadherin by western blotting and RT-PCR. The role of GLI2 in development of bone metastases was determined following intracardiac injection of melanoma cells in immunocompromised mice (n = 5-13). Human melanoma samples (n = 79) at various stages of disease progression were analyzed for GLI2 and E-cadherin expression by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, or RT-PCR. All statistical tests were two-sided.;Among melanoma cell lines, increased GLI2 expression was associated with loss of E-cadherin expression and with increased capacity to invade Matrigel and to form bone metastases in mice (mean osteolytic tumor area: GLI2high vs GLI2low, 2.81 vs 0.93 mm(2), difference = 1.88 mm(2), 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16 to 2.60, P < .001). Reduction of GLI2 expression in melanoma cells that had expressed high levels of GLI2 substantially inhibited both basal and TGF-beta-induced cell migration, invasion (mean number of Matrigel invading cells: shGLI2 vs shCtrl (control), 52.6 vs 100, difference = 47.4, 95% CI = 37.0 to 57.8, P = .024; for shGLI2 + TGF-beta vs shCtrl + TGF-beta, 31.0 vs 161.9, difference = -130.9, 95% CI = -96.2 to -165.5, P = .002), and MMP secretion in vitro and the development of experimental bone metastases in mice.

In contrast, melanoma-associated fibroblasts within the reticular dermis express Col(I) mRNA at a level that is comparable to its expression in uninvolved dermis and reduced amount of collagen protein can be observed. To determine the significance of Col(I) expression in melanoma, we pharmacologically inhibited its transcription in a porcine cutaneous melanoma model by oral administration of halofuginone. When administered before melanoma development, it reduced melanoma incidence and diminished the transition from microinvasive toward deeply invasive growth by limiting the development of a tumor vasculature. Whereas invasive melanoma growth has been correlated with increased blood vessel density previously, our data for the first time demonstrate that the proangiogenic effect of Col(I) expression by fibroblasts and vascular cells precedes the development of invasive melanomas in a de novo tumor model.",

The role of hnRNP K in cancer is relatively understudied. However, several cellular functions strongly indicate that hnRNP K is involved in tumorigenesis. Oncogenes c-Src, c-myc, and eIF4E are regulated by hnRNP K. We have shown an increased cytoplasmic hnRNP K in pancreatic cancer. In the present study, we investigated the altered expression of hnRNP K protein and its correlation with p-ERK in melanoma using human melanoma cell lines and tissue microarray.;The protein levels of hnRNP K and p-ERK in 8 human melanoma cell lines and a melanoma progression tissue microarray containing 80 melanoma, 23 dysplastic nevi, and 14 benign nevi specimens were analyzed using Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis. hnRNP K was knocked down by siRNA, and its effect on melanoma cells was assessed.;We showed a higher hnRNP K protein level in both melanoma cell lines and melanoma tissue specimens, which correlated with a higher c-myc expression. An increase in the cytoplasmic hnRNP K and eIF4E protein levels in melanoma cells is also seen. p-ERK level was also higher in dysplastic nevi and melanoma tissues, but did not correlate with hnRNP K protein level. We then demonstrated that knocking down of hnRNP K by siRNA inhibited melanoma cell growth and colony formation, as well as c-myc expression.;hnRNP K expression correlated with melanoma and may play a role in melanoma tumorigenesis.",

In 2002 a further increase occurred, to 1842 new registrations and 235 deaths from melanoma. It is likely that 328 of the 1842 new cases of melanoma in 2002 were directly attributable to severe sunburn. A reduction of 10% in the number of people getting severely sunburnt could prevent 28 melanoma cases per year. If 2% of melanoma deaths occur in high-risk individuals, approximately 4 deaths per year could be prevented by surveillance of high-risk groups. Thin melanoma has a very good prognosis: a 10% shift in the depth distribution into the thinnest depth category would result in about 29 deaths from melanoma prevented each year.;The best avenues for reducing the burden of melanoma in New Zealand are prevention of excessive sun exposure and early diagnosis.

        "Doc_abstract":"Malignant melanoma is the most invasive and deadly form of skin cancer with no effective therapy to treat advanced disease, leading to poor survival rates. Akt3 signaling plays an important role in deregulating apoptosis in approximately 70% of melanomas. Thus, targeting Akt3 signaling in melanoma patients has significant therapeutic potential for inhibiting melanomas, but no Akt3-specific chemotherapeutic agent exists. Unfortunately, nonspecific Akt inhibitors can cause systemic toxicity or increase metastasis. Identifying and targeting the Akt3 substrate that deregulates apoptosis might circumvent these complications but would require demonstration of its functional importance in disrupting normal apoptosis. In this study, PRAS40 was identified as an Akt3 substrate that deregulated apoptosis to promote melanoma tumorigenesis. Levels of phosphorylated PRAS40 (pPRAS40) increased during melanoma tumor progression paralleling increasing Akt3 activity. Majority of melanomas from patients with elevated Akt activity also had correspondingly higher levels of pPRAS40. Targeting PRAS40 or upstream Akt3 similarly reduced anchorage-independent growth in culture and inhibited tumor development in mice. Mechanistically, decreased pPRAS40 increased tumor cell apoptosis as well as sensitivity of melanoma cells to apoptosis-inducing agents, thereby decreasing chemoresistance. Collectively, these studies provide a solid mechanistic basis for targeting PRAS40 to inhibit the Akt3 signaling cascade and thereby retard melanoma development.",

The antigen, detected by autologous serum S150, was found to be broadly represented on melanoma, glioma, renal cell carcinoma, neuroblastoma and head and neck carcinoma cell lines. S150 did not react with bladder or colon carcinoma, fetal fibroblasts, pooled platelets, lymphocytes and red blood cells, autologous cultured lymphocytes or fetal calf serum. To further characterize the antigen, spent tissue culture media, obtained from autologous melanoma cell line, Y-Mel 84:420, was separated by an isoelectric focusing column. Unabsorbed control serum S150 was noted to have a maximum titer of 1:2040 against autologous melanoma cells as measured by protein A hemadsorption. Following isoelectric focusing the greatest decrease in autologous antibody titer (30-fold) occurred with fractions having a pI between 2 and 3. Further resolution of the antigen was accomplished with high-pressure ion-exchange chromatography. One of these fractions showed a significantly higher concentration of antigen and was distinctly resolved from bulk serum albumin. Subsequent Western blot analysis, with autologous antibody, of the isolated antigen-containing fraction, confirmed the presence of a single 66 kDa band. Exposure of the antigen, purified by high-pressure ion-exchange chromatography, to neuraminidase ablated recognition by autologous antibody and suggests that sialic acid is present on the protein and may be part of the antigenic epitope. Binding of antigen, obtained following DEAE anion exchange chromatography, was noted to lectins derived from Triticum vulgaris, Dolichos biflorus and Lycopersicon esculentum. Preparative purification of the antigen was accomplished by anion exchange followed by lectin affinity chromatography with a Dolichos biflorus column. Antigen obtained following lectin affinity chromatography subjected to SDS-PAGE and silver stain revealed a single band at 66 kDa. We conclude that a melanoma-associated antigen detected by autologous antibody in spent tissue culture media is an unusually acidic glycoprotein (pI 2-3).",

Eighteen of 22 (82%) of patients treated for microscopic residual disease have been free of local recurrence to date.

Nine achieved a complete remission (39%) of tumor in the irradiated volume and three are alive and free of disease at up to 56 months following irradiation treatment. Three major complications of irradiation have been seen in the 54 patients treated.

We previously showed that melanoma cells with high ALDH activity (ALDH(high)) are endowed with higher self-renewal and tumorigenic abilities than the population with low activity (ALDH(low)), suggesting that ALDH might be a good marker to select for melanoma CSC/TIC.

Mutations in B-RAF are frequent in melanoma and are known to regulate the invasive phenotype. In this study, we sought to determine the molecular mechanisms controlling melanoma invasion. We found that mutant B-RAF signaling regulates a cadherin switch. In melanoma cells expressing mutant B-RAF we observed high levels of N-cadherin and low levels of E-cadherin. Depletion of mutant B-RAF, by small interfering RNA, caused a decrease in the levels of N-cadherin and an increase in the levels of E-cadherin. Mechanistically, we found that this cadherin switch required the activity of Rac1 and its GEF, Tiam1, both of which show suppressed activity in the presence of mutant B-RAF. Consistent with the work of others, we found that depletion of mutant B-RAF decreased the invasive capacity of the melanoma cells. However, simultaneous depletion of B-RAF and Rac or Tiam1 resulted in invasive capacity similar to that of control cells. Taken together, our results suggest that mutant B-RAF signaling downregulates Tiam1/Rac activity resulting in an increase in N-cadherin levels and a decrease in E-cadherin levels and ultimately enhanced invasion.

In our studies both MSH and insulin stimulated the colony-forming ability and the proliferative capacity of S-91 murine melanoma cells grown in soft agar with either serum-supplemented or serum-less medium. Unless insulin and/or MSH were present, Cloudman S-91 melanoma cells failed to clone in soft agar.

The concurrent treatment of S91 melanoma cells with both MSH and insulin resulted in a greater increase in the total number of colonies formed than caused by treatment with either hormone alone.

Primary melanoma cell lines were obtained from a series of patients with either eye or skin melanoma. The ability of tumor cells to stimulate T cells in the absence of exogenous growth factors was assessed in mixed-lymphocyte tumor cell cultures in which allogeneic lymphocytes were stimulated with irradiated ocular or skin melanoma cells. Expression of HLA class I and class II on tumor cells, in the presence or absence of IFN-gamma, was determined by flow cytometry. The ability of tumor cells to inhibit T-cell proliferation was determined by adding various concentrations of irradiated tumor cells to standard mixed-lymphocyte cultures. Our results indicate that primary skin melanoma cells induce vigorous proliferation of allo-antigen-specific T cells. By contrast, ocular melanoma cells failed to induce significant T-cell proliferation. The failure of ocular melanoma cells to stimulate lymphocyte proliferation was not due to low levels of either class I or class II on tumor cells since tumor cells treated with IFN-gamma expressed high levels of class I and class II but still failed to induce lymphocyte proliferation. Ocular melanoma cells inhibited lymphocyte proliferation, as shown by experiments in which a small number of tumor cells prevented proliferation of T cells in mixed-lymphocyte cultures. Inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation required cell-to-cell contact, and supernatants from tumor cell cultures did not prevent lymphocyte proliferation. Moreover, the ability of ocular melanoma cells to inhibit T-cell proliferation was lost when tumor cells migrated from the eye and formed hepatic metastases. We conclude that there is a fundamental difference in the immunogenicity of ocular and skin melanoma cells. Ocular melanomas, but not primary skin melanomas, are poorly immunogenic tumors that inhibit T-cell proliferation. Our results imply that the immunogenicity of melanoma cells is altered when they develop within the unique ocular micro-environment.",

Screening bias in countries with high levels of sun exposure is also an issue. Now that progress is being made in the genetic subclassification of melanoma tumours, it is apparent that melanomas have different somatic changes according to body sites/histological subtypes and that UV exposure may be relevant for some but not all types of melanomas. Melanoma behaviour also points to non-sun-related risk factors, and complex gene-environment interactions are likely. As UV exposure is the only environmental factor ever linked to melanoma, it is still prudent to avoid excessive sun exposure and sunburn especially in poor tanners. However, the impact of strict sun avoidance, which should not be recommended, may take years to be apparent as vitamin D deficiency is a now a common health issue in Caucasian populations, with a significant impact on health in general.

Tumor cells obtain oxygen and nutriment through VM channels in the early, rapid-growth stage when blood vessels are insufficient. VM channels are characterized by tubular structures with tumor cells. Autophagy is a catabolic process, by which the cell digests damaged components or organelles of its own cytoplasm in response to nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, and the presence of non-functional protein aggregates. In fact, autophagy plays an important role in normal cell growth, development, and homeostasis. However, it is still controversial whether autophagy is also involved in cell death or cell survival in malignancy. In the present study, we therefore investigated the expression levels of two autophagy-related proteins, microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain 3 (LC3) and beclin-1, with respect to melanoma metastasis and vasculogenic mimicry. Melanoma is characterized by rapid growth, high-metastasis rate, and unpredictable behavior. A total of 70 human melanoma tissues were analyzed, showing that VM was present in 31 melanoma specimens (44.3%). Melanoma cells displayed high levels of autophagy when VM was present. Real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical analyses showed that the expression levels of beclin-1 and LC3 mRNAs and proteins were both higher in the VM-positive melanoma than those in the VM-negative melanoma (p<0.05). Moreover, the expression of LC3, rather than beclin-1, was strongly associated with metastasis and poor clinical prognosis of human melanoma. Therefore, the enhanced autophagic activity may be related to VM and metastasis of melanoma.",

The Guideline for the Management of Melanoma has been developed in an attempt to improve management through the process of locating the best available evidence on which to base decisions. It is expected to help to improve the quality of care. 2. Melanoma remains a common cancer in South Africa. Despite the achievement of earlier diagnosis, it would appear from current statistics that at least 850 people continue to die of melanoma each year. Many of these deaths occur at a younger age than for other solid tumours, so the number of years of life lost due to melanoma exceeds that of many other cancers. It is seen as imperative to maximise effective management of melanoma. 3. Prevention of melanoma has not yet been achieved, and there are no conclusive data to show that current promotion of sun avoidance has substantially altered its incidence. 4. Early detection is an important factor in melanoma management, with diagnosis based mainly on changes in colour, diameter, elevation and border (irregularity of outline) of a skin lesion, asymmetry of a lesion, or a lesion different from other naevi. People at high risk of melanoma should be offered a surveillance programme.;1. All clinicians should be trained in the recognition of early melanoma. 2. If there is doubt about a lesion, the patient should be referred for specialist opinion (if readily available) or a biopsy should be undertaken. Biopsy of a pigmented lesion should be done only on the basis of suspicion of melanoma. Excision with a 2 mm margin is adequate. 3. Prophylactic excision of benign naevi is not recommended. In general, elective lymph node dissection is not indicated. 4. People with high-risk primary melanoma, lymph node involvement and melanoma in unusual sites (e.g. mucosal and disseminated melanoma) should be managed with support from a melanoma centre.;Melanoma management involves many medical specialties.

Melanocytes are pigment-producing cells of the epidermis, precursors for melanoma, and express high levels of Plexin C1, which is lost in melanoma in vitro and in vivo. To determine if Plexin C1 is a tumor suppressor for melanoma, we introduced Plexin C1 into a primary human melanoma cell line, and phenotypes including migration, apoptosis, proliferation and tumor growth in mice were analyzed. Complimentary studies in which Plexin C1 was silenced in human melanocytes were performed. Plexin C1 significantly inhibited migration and proliferation in melanoma, whereas in melanocytes, loss of Plexin C1 increased migration and proliferation. In mouse xenografts, Plexin C1 delayed tumor growth of melanoma at early time points, but tumors eventually escaped the suppressive effects of Plexin C1, due to Plexin C1-dependent activation of the pro-survival protein Akt. R-Ras activation stimulates melanoma migration. Plexin C1 lowered R-Ras activity in melanoma and melanocytes, consistent with inhibitory effects of Plexin C1 on migration of melanocytes and melanoma. To determine if R-Ras is expressed in melanocytic lesions in vivo, staining of tissue microarrays of nevi and melanoma were performed. R-Ras expression was highly limited in melanocytic lesions, being essentially confined to primary melanoma, and almost completely absent in nevi and metastatic melanoma. These data suggest that loss of Plexin C1 in melanoma may promote early steps in melanoma progression through suppression of migration and proliferation, but pro-survival effects of Plexin C1 ultimately abrogate the tumor suppressive effects of Plexin C1. In primary melanoma, loss of Plexin C1 may function in early steps of melanoma progression by releasing inhibition of R-Ras activation, and stimulating migration.",

        "Doc_abstract":"According to recent findings that beside cancers traditionally considered as hormone-dependent, several other tumor types show different behavior in the two sexes, indicating the possible role of endocrine factors in the course of these diseases. The possibility that endocrine factors may influence the clinical course of human malignant melanoma is suggested by the higher survival rate in premenopausal vs. postmenopausal women or men of any ages. However, investigations on the sex hormone receptor status of human cutaneous melanomas and experiments attempting to support the epidemiological results yielded conflicting results. In our human melanoma cell lines we failed to detect steroid receptors at protein level, while quantitative PCR demonstrated that their mRNA expression level was orders of magnitude lower compared to the positive control cell lines. Sex hormones did not influence the in vitro features of the human melanoma cells considerably. On the other hand, glucocorticoid receptor was present both at mRNA and protein level, although dexamethasone was effective in vitro only at high doses. Our previous experiments showed that intrasplenic injection of human melanoma cells resulted in a significantly higher number of liver colonies in male than in female SCID mice. We now show that this difference evolves during the first day. After injection into the tail vein we did not observe gender-dependent difference in the efficiency of pulmonary colonization. Examining the pattern of metastasis formation after intracardiac injection, we have found differences between the two sexes in the incidence or number of colonies only in the case of the liver but not in other organs. We concluded that the observed phenomenon is specific to the liver; therefore we investigated the effects of 2-methoxyestradiol, an endogenous metabolite of estradiol produced mainly in the liver, with an estrogen receptor-independent antitumor activity. 2ME2 effectively inhibited melanoma cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis and an arrest in the G2/M phase. The mechanism of action involved microtubules, mitochondrial damage and caspase activation as well. In SCID mice, 2ME2 was effective in reducing primary tumor weight and the number of liver colonies after intrasplenic injection of human melanoma cells, and causing significantly higher rate of apoptotic cells in the colonies.",

Here we report that a high proportion (68%) of melanoma cell lines are either partially (40%) or severely (28%) compromised for the G2 phase decatenation checkpoint that normally functions to ensure that the sister chromatids are able to separate correctly during mitosis. The consequence of this loss of checkpoint function is a severely reduced ability to partition the replicated genome in mitosis and thereby increase genomic instability. We also demonstrate that decatenation is dependent on both TopoIIα and β isoforms. The high incidence of decatenation checkpoint defect is likely to be a major contributor to the high level of genomic instability found in melanomas. ",

Neither grade III/IV toxicities, nor clinically significant changes in blood and biochemical parameters were noted after an induction course of 10 XPV subcutaneous immunizations.

Overexpression of Nck1 in fibroblasts has been shown to be oncogenic. Through the years this concept has been challenged and the consensus is now that overexpression of either Nck cooperates with strong oncogenes to transform cells. Therefore, variations in Nck expression levels in transformed cells could endorse cancer progression.;Expression of Nck1 and Nck2 proteins in various cancer cell lines at different stages of progression were analyzed by western blots. We created human primary melanoma cell lines overexpressing GFP-Nck2 and investigated their ability to proliferate along with metastatic characteristics such as migration and invasion. By western blot analysis, we compared levels of proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine as well as cadherins and integrins in human melanoma cells overexpressing or not Nck2. Finally, in mice we assessed tumor growth rate of human melanoma cells expressing increasing levels of Nck2.;We found that expression of Nck2 is consistently increased in various metastatic cancer cell lines compared with primary counterparts. Particularly, we observed significant higher levels of Nck2 protein and mRNA, as opposed to no change in Nck1, in human metastatic melanoma cell lines compared with non-metastatic melanoma and normal melanocytes. We demonstrated the involvement of Nck2 in proliferation, migration and invasion in human melanoma cells. Moreover, we discovered that Nck2 overexpression in human primary melanoma cells correlates with higher levels of proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, assembly of Nck2-dependent pY-proteins-containing molecular complexes and downregulation of cadherins and integrins. Importantly, we uncovered that injection of Nck2-overexpressing human primary melanoma cells into mice increases melanoma-derived tumor growth rate.;Collectively, our data indicate that Nck2 effectively influences human melanoma phenotype progression. At the molecular level, we propose that Nck2 in human primary melanoma promotes the formation of molecular complexes regulating proliferation and actin cytoskeleton dynamics by modulating kinases or phosphatases activities that results in increased levels of proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. This study provides new insights regarding cancer progression that could impact on the therapeutic strategies targeting cancer.",

The overall age-standardized incidence rate was 24.4 per 100,000 per annum (27.5 for men and 22.2 for women). There was no change in the incidence rate over the study period. Most melanomas in both sexes (74% of women and 71% of men) were < 1.5 mm Breslow thickness. Results of this study indicate a high incidence rate of melanoma in white South Africans, comparable with that in Australia, which demands urgent preventive health measures.",

However, the concentrations of NO that melanoma cells are exposed to in vivo have been unknown. To provide cell kinetic data for use in predicting those concentrations, synthesis and consumption of NO was examined in A375 melanoma cells. Nitric oxide synthesis was undetectable. The rate of intracellular NO consumption was determined by continuous monitoring of NO concentrations following injection of NO solutions in a closed chamber. After correcting for autoxidation and consumption from media-generated O(2)(-), the rate constant obtained for cellular consumption was 7.1±1.1 s(-1). This information was combined with previous data on macrophage NO kinetics to develop a mathematical model to predict NO levels in cutaneous melanomas. Synthesis of NO by macrophages in the stroma was found to give a maximum concentration at the tumor periphery of 0.2 μM. Because of the high rates of cellular consumption, the elevation in NO concentration is predicted to be very localized, approximately 90% of the concentration decay occurring within 30 μm of the tumor edge. High NO concentrations at the periphery of a melanoma may contribute to metastasis by stimulating cell proliferation, inhibiting apoptosis, or acting as a lymphangiogenic factor.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Metastatic malignant melanoma has a wide spectrum of histopathologic patterns and often lacks melanin pigment. Without a known primary tumor, the diagnosis of metastatic malignant melanoma relies on a combination of morphology and immunohistochemical profile. Infrequently, commonly used markers for melanoma (S100, HMB45, Melan-A and Tyrosinase A) are negative. These cases pose critical diagnostic challenges. Recent studies show that Microphthalmia Transcription Factor (MITF) has high sensitivity (88-100%) and specificity for metastatic melanoma. We are reporting here three cases of high grade tumors that were studied by a comprehensive immunohistochemical panel including cytokeratins, S100, HMB-45, Melan A, Tyrosinase, and MITF. All three tumors were also analyzed for the presence of BRAF mutations. All three metastatic tumors were negative for S100, Melan A, HMB-45 and Tyrosinase but positive for MITF. Subsequent to the diagnoses, previously existing or concurrent primary melanomas were identified in 2 of the 3 cases. Interestingly, S100, Melan A, and HMB-45 were positive in the primary tumors. No BRAF (V600E) mutations were identified in the three metastatic melanomas and CD 117 (c-kit) was positive in one of the cases. In summary, our experience shows that MITF can be a valuable adjunct in the diagnosis of metastatic tumors that are suspicious for melanoma but negative for other melanoma markers. ",

At present, disseminated, macrometastatic melanoma is incurable in the majority of cases. Single agent chemotherapy has modest effects and results in disease remission in a minority of patients, usually of short duration, Combination chemotherapy, or the combination of chemotherapeutic drugs and cytokines, results in increased response rates and occasionally remissions of prolonged duration. So far, no regimen has demonstrated improved survival compared to single agent therapy in disseminated melanoma. New insights into the mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs may lead to development of predictive tests that can identify individuals with tumors sensitive to a specific agent, as well as to the development of strategies to circumvent drug resistance. It has recently been shown that adjuvant therapy of high-risk melanoma with large doses of interferon-alpha 2b significantly prolongs relapse-free and overall survival, at the price of considerable toxicity. Ongoing studies aim to define the optimum dose and duration of adjuvant interferon therapy. Recent advances in molecular biology and immunology may lead to the development of new treatment modalities, such as improved vaccines and other biologic therapies, which may benefit patients with malignant melanoma.",

With regard to genetic factors, the discovery of two types of genes was a great advance in further understanding the biology of the melanocyte. CDKN2A (p16) is the prototype of the high-penetrance, low-prevalence gene related to melanoma. This gene has been studied in some families in which several members have been diagnosed with melanoma. In the general population with non-familial melanoma, low-penetrance, high-prevalence genes such as MC1R seem to be more interesting. Studies on the MC1R gene have not only shown its importance in skin and hair pigmentation, but also in the development of melanoma. Functional studies on CDKN2A and MC1R have led us to new and important conclusions. The analysis of data from studies on families, twins and control cases, with the collaboration of several countries, will lead us to new discoveries.

Both incidences and deaths associated with melanoma are increasing in Caucasian populations. While exposure to ultraviolet radiation through sun-exposure is the major risk factor; the host factors including skin type and number of moles are critical in predisposition. The CDKN2A is a high penetrance melanoma susceptibility gene as carriers of the mutations are predisposed to the disease within familial settings. The gene is also somatically altered to varying degrees in sporadic melanoma. The CDK4 gene due to occurrence of activation mutations in a few families worldwide represents another melanoma susceptibility locus. The variants within the melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) gene, which encodes a melanocyte specific surface receptor with a key role in pigmentation, are associated with high risk phenotypes and increased risk of melanoma. Melanoma tumors are characterized by activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway through either autocrine growth factor stimulation or oncogenic mutations in the B-RAF or N-RAS genes. Somatic mutations in the B-RAF gene are complemented by those in the N-RAS gene and represent the major genetic alterations. The mutations in the B-RAF gene in melanoma due to occurrence in melanocytic nevi represent early events that additionally require loss of cell cycle inhibitors like CDKN2A for melanoma progression and development. The sequence of events points to the cooperative collaboration between different genetic pathways in tumor development that can be and are being used as targets for developing specific therapeutic agents.",

Mutated ras genes have been isolated from human melanoma cell lines, but subsequent studies indicated that ras gene mutations may be a rare event in melanocytic lesions. Recently, a study reported a high frequency of ras mutations correlated with increasing invasion level. To address this inconsistency in the published data, we analyzed 50 primary melanomas to correlate invasion level, tumor thickness, histologic typing, and body localization with point mutations around codons 12/13/61 of the three ras genes. After micro-dissection of paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, ras gene mutations were analyzed by direct sequencing of tumor DNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Only two melanomas exhibited ras gene mutations, one sample containing a transition from A to G at position 2 of N-ras codon 61 and the other exhibiting a transversion from C to A at position 1 and a transition from A to G at position 2 of N-ras codon 61. Both tumors were classified as Clark level IV, with a tumor thickness of 2.5 and 1.2 mm, respectively. Both were typed as superficial spreading melanoma and localized to intermittently sun-exposed body sites. The low frequency of ras mutations in malignant melanoma and the lack of ras mutations in melanoma samples from constantly sun-exposed body sites argue against the hypothesis of ras mutations as a marker of progression in malignant melanoma and the suggestion that ras mutations occur predominantly in melanomas from constantly sun-exposed body sites.",

By contrast, the nonclassical human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-G class I molecule displays immunotolerant properties and can be ectopically expressed by tumor cells, thereby allowing their escape from immunosurveillance. We describe here that a melanoma cell line, named Fon, established from an HLA-G-positive melanoma biopsy, spontaneously expressed high levels of the HLA-G1 membrane-bound isoform. Exosomes released by Fon cells were purified and analyzed both for their density on sucrose gradient and their protein composition by Western blotting and flow cytometry. Besides the expression of well-described proteins such as Lamp-2, notably, these melanoma-derived exosomes bore HLA-G1. In addition, exosomes harboring HLA-G1 were secreted by the HLA-G-negative M8 melanoma cells transfected with the HLA-G1 cDNA. Thus, the presence of tolerogenic HLA-G molecules on melanoma-derived exosomes may provide a novel way for tumors to modulate host's immune response.",

In this report, using zymography, we compared the basal secretion levels of active matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 to levels in response to various extracellular matrix proteins, cytokines, and growth factors in normal human melanocyte cells and melanoma cell lines from different stages of neoplastic progression. Basal matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity was only detected in vertical growth phase and metastatic melanoma cell lines, suggesting that matrix metalloproteinase-9 is a candidate biomarker for identifying vertical growth phase and metastatic melanomas. Most melanoma cell lines and cultured normal melanocytes produced high levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2. In addition, both tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta are strong inducers of active matrix metalloproteinase-9 in vertical growth phase melanoma cell lines, indicating a possible role of these cytokines in the switch from radial growth phase to vertical growth phase. We propose that these proinflammatory cytokines promote melanoma invasion in part through upregulating matrix metalloproteinase-9. Both these cytokines are released from keratinocytes in the epidermis by ultraviolet radiation. Thus, our study suggests that the microenvironment of melanoma cells is an important feature in melanoma progression, and ultraviolet-radiation-induced cytokines might promote the progression of melanoma through the release or activation of matrix metalloproteinases.",

No consensus was reached for tumours thicker than 3.0 mm. The conclusion of the histopathological report should state the histological type of melanoma, the thickness, the level of invasion, the presence of ulceration, regression, microsatellitosis and completeness of removal. In melanomas between 1.5 mm and 4 mm, elective lymph node dissection may be considered, but its value has not been proven. Clinically suspicious regional lymph nodes require a therapeutical lymph node dissection, solitary lymph node removal is inappropriate. Prophylactic (adjuvant) regional perfusion in primary melanoma should only be performed in the context of a clinical trial. Regional perfusion is the treatment of choice for satellitosis and/or in-transit metastases of the extremities without evidence of distant metastases. If radiotherapy is indicated, high fractionation doses are required. There is no standard therapy for distant metastases.

In this study, we investigated the effects of BAY 87-2243, a small molecule that inhibits the first OXPHOS enzyme (complex I), in melanoma in vitro and in vivo.;BAY 87-2243 decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption and induced partial depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential. This was associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, lowering of total cellular ATP levels, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and reduced cell viability. The latter was rescued by the antioxidant vitamin E and high extracellular glucose levels (25 mM), indicating the involvement of ROS-induced cell death and a dependence on glycolysis for cell survival upon BAY 87-2243 treatment. BAY 87-2243 significantly reduced tumor growth in various BRAF mutant melanoma mouse xenografts and patient-derived melanoma mouse models. Furthermore, we provide evidence that inhibition of mutated BRAF using the specific small molecule inhibitor vemurafenib increased the OXPHOS dependency of BRAF mutant melanoma cells. As a consequence, the combination of both inhibitors augmented the anti-tumor effect of BAY 87-2243 in a BRAF mutant melanoma mouse xenograft model.;Taken together, our results suggest that complex I inhibition has potential clinical applications as a single agent in melanoma and also might be efficacious in combination with BRAF inhibitors in the treatment of patients with BRAF mutant melanoma.",

Normal melanocytes were found to secrete both IFN-alpha and IFN-beta after virus induction. In contrast, although all but one of the melanoma lines tested were capable of secreting IFN-beta, none were capable of IFN-alpha secretion. This phenomenon was not due to defects in either translation of IFN-alpha mRNA or secretion of IFN-alpha proteins, since transfection of melanoma lines with a constitutive IFN-alpha 2b expression vector resulted in the secretion of high levels of IFN. On further examination, this inability to express natural IFN-alpha appeared to be due to a defect in activation of the IFN-alpha promoters, since constructs containing the IFN-alpha promotor were completely unresponsive to viral infection in melanoma cells but inducible in melanocytes. These results show that there is a specific disruption of IFN-alpha gene activation rather than IFN-beta in melanoma lines and suggest that this is due to disruption of a trans-acting IFN-alpha gene transcription factor.

There is no therapy for advanced-stage melanoma and its metastasis because of their high resistance to various anticancer therapies. Human skin is an important metabolic organ in which occurs photoinduced synthesis of vitamin D3 from 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC). 7-DHC, the precursor of cholesterol biosynthesis, is highly reactive and easily modifiable to produce 7-DHC-derived compounds. The intracellular levels of 7-DHC or its derivatives can have deleterious effects on cellular functionality and viability. In this study we evaluated the effects on melanoma cell lines of 7-DHC as such and for this aim we used much care to minimize 7-DHC modifications. We found that from 12 to 72 h of treatment 82-86% of 7-DHC entered the cells, and the levels of 7-DHC-derived compounds were not significant. Simultaneously, reactive oxygen species production was significantly increased already after 2h. After 24 h and up to 72 h, 7-DHC-treated melanoma cells showed a reduction in cell growth and viability. The cytotoxic effect of 7-DHC was associated with an increase in Bax levels, decrease in Bcl-2/Bax ratio, reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential, increase in apoptosis-inducing factor levels, unchanged caspase-3 activity, and absence of cleavage of PARP-1. These findings could explain the mechanism through which 7-DHC exerts its cytotoxic effects.

In this study, we compared DmtDNA4977 levels in blood leukocytes from 206 melanoma patients and 219 healthy controls. Overall, melanoma cases had significantly higher levels of DmtDNA4977 than healthy controls (median: 0.60 vs 0.20, P = 0.008). The difference was evident among individuals who were older than 47 yrs, women, and had pigmentation risk factors (e.g., blond or red hair, blue eye, fair skin, light, or none tanning ability after prolonged sun exposure, and freckling in the sun as a child). The difference was also evident among those who had at least one lifetime sunburn with blistering and had no reported use of a sunlamp. Interestingly, among controls, DmtDNA4977 levels differed by phenotypic index and reported use of a sunlamp.

        "Doc_abstract":"Metastatic cutaneous melanoma is highly resistant to cytotoxic drugs, and this contributes to poor prognosis. In vivo studies on the chemosensitivity of metastatic melanoma are rare and hampered by poor response rates to systemic chemotherapeutics. Patients who undergo isolated limb infusion (ILI) with cytotoxic drugs show high response rates and are, therefore, a good cohort for studying chemosensitivity in vivo. We used tumors from patients who underwent ILI to study the role of melanoma tumor-suppressor genes and oncogenes on melanoma chemosensitivity. Prospectively acquired tumors from 30 patients who subsequently underwent ILI with melphalan and actinomycin-D for metastatic melanoma were investigated for mRNA expression levels of p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), and MITFm. The mutation status of B-RAF, N-RAS, and PTEN were also determined. A high percentage of tumors had activating mutations in either B-RAF (15/30) or N-RAS (10/30) and only two tumors carried altered PTEN. High expression of p16(INK4a) and absence of an activating B-RAF mutation independently predicted response to treatment. Further, inducible expression of p16(INK4a) sensitized a melanoma cell line to death induced by melphalan or actinomycin-D. This study shows that high expression of p16(INK4a) or the absence of activated B-RAF correlates with in vivo response of melanoma to cytotoxic drugs.",

We have analyzed here p53 mutations in melanoma cell lines and studied its stabilization, DNA-binding activity, and target gene activation by UVC. p53 was mutated in three of seven melanoma cell lines. However, high levels of p53 were detected in all cell lines, including melanoma cells with wild-type p53, with the exception of one line with a truncated form. Upon UV induction, p53 accumulated in lines with wild-type p53, and p53 target genes p21Cip1/Waf1, GADD45, and mdm2 were induced, but the induction of p21Cip1/Waf1 was significantly delayed as compared with the increase in p53 DNA-binding activity. However, despite p53 target gene induction, p53 DNA-binding activity was absent in one melanoma line with wild-type p53, and p53 target genes were induced also in cells with mutant p53. In response to UV, DNA replication ceased in all cell lines, and apoptosis ensued in four lines independently of p53 but correlated with high induction of GADD45. The results suggest that in melanoma, several p53 regulatory steps are dislodged; its basal expression is high, its activation in response to UV damage is diminished, and the regulation of its target genes p21Cip1/Waf1 and GADD45 are dissociated from p53 regulation.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Here, we report the molecular regulation of interleukin (IL)-8 expression in human melanoma cells. The inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) up-regulated IL-8 expression, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, in three metastatic melanoma variants, SBC-2 (nonmetastatic), A375P (low metastatic), and A375SM (high metastatic), by increased transcription of the IL-8 gene, leading to increased levels of IL-8 mRNA and protein production. Furthermore, we report that IFN-alpha and IFN-beta did not inhibit steady-state IL-8 production. However, IFN-alpha and IFN-beta inhibited IL-1beta or TNF-alpha-mediated up-regulation of IL-8 mRNA. In addition, IFN-beta demonstrated a more potent inhibitory effect at a lower concentration than did IFN-alpha. Both pretreatment and simultaneous treatment of melanoma cells with IFN-alpha or IFN-beta inhibited the IL-1beta and TNF-alpha up-regulation of IL-8 mRNA levels. This inhibition was at the transcriptional levels and was unaffected by a protein synthesis inhibitor, suggesting that this did not require de novo protein synthesis. Further, modulation of IL-8 levels by IL-1beta, alone or in combination with IFN-beta, affected the proliferation of melanoma cells. In summary, our data suggest that the up-regulation of IL-8 expression in melanoma cells is regulated at the transcriptional level and is rapidly and specifically inhibited by IFN-alpha or IFN-beta, independent of de novo protein synthesis, perhaps due to a transient modification of a preexisting factor(s).",

The peak of incidence lies in the fifth and sixth life decade. Five types of the tumor are known: lentigo maligna melanoma, superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, acrolentiginous melanoma and non-classifiable melanoma. For estimation of prognosis and choice of adequate mode of therapy histopathological examinations with regard to the level of invasion according to Clark and Chung, histomorphometric evaluation of the depth of invasion suggested by Breslow and the pronostic index of Schmoeckel and Braun-Falco are useful. The operative therapy of choice is the extensive tumor excision. In case of extended local invasion radical vulvectomy is indicated, in certain cases combined with inguinal, sometimes even pelvic lymphonodectomy. In inoperable cases radiotherapy may be tried, but success seems to be poor. Polychemotherapy may induce remissions, but hardly a prolongation of survival. New therapy trials are dealing with immunmodulation, mostly using different substances of biological response modifiers. The prognosis of malignant melanoma of the vulva must be considered to be poorer than that of melanomas in other sites of the body, local recurrence is frequent, the five year survival rate being 30-35%. Whether pregnancy does have an effect on melanoma growth is still unknown. Early stages of melanoma disease may be treated without interrupting pregnancy, whereas advanced stages require termination of pregnancy, followed by specific tumor therapy.",

Moreover, several human ABC proteins are responsible for drug exclusion in compound-treated tumor cells, providing cellular mechanisms for the development of multidrug resistance and, therefore, playing an important role in malignant transformation. As only limited information exists on the role of ABC transporters in melanoma, the aim of the study was to generate a complete expression profile of ABC transporters in this tumor entity. Using a TaqMan low-density array for 47 human ABC transporters, mRNA expression analysis was performed from normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEM P2 and NHEM P3), nine different cell lines originating from primary melanoma (Mel Ei, Mel Juso, Mel Ho and Mel Wei), and metastases of malignant melanoma (Mel Im, Mel Ju, SK Mel 28, HTZ 19 and HMB2). Cell line-specific expression levels were compared with gene expression in pooled RNA from a variety of other human tissues. High expression levels were detected in pooled tissue RNA as well as in cells of melanocytic origin for ABCA5, ABCB2, ABCB6, ABCD3, ABCD4, ABCF1, ABCF2 and ABCF3, whereas ABCB5 revealed a melanocyte-specific high transcript level. In relation to normal melanocytes, ABCB3, ABCB6, ABCC2, ABCC4, ABCE1 and ABCF2 were significantly increased in melanoma cell lines, whereas ABCA7, ABCA12, ABCB2, ABCB4, ABCB5 and ABCD1 showed lower expression levels. In summary, we present here for the first time an ABC-transporter mRNA expression profile in melanoma in comparison to normal melanocytes. The differentially regulated ABC transporters detected by our approach may be candidate genes involved in melanoma tumorigenesis, progression and therapy resistance and could therefore be of great importance to identify novel options for melanoma therapy.",

Microstaging was done according to the depth of invasion, as determined by Clark's levels as well as by direct measurement. This was related to treatment and to clinical course. There was a correlation between the depth of invasion by Clark's levels and the incidence of lymph node metastases in patients with Stage I melanoma who had elective node dissection. The incidence of nodal metastases was 4% for Level II, 7% FOR Level III, 25% for Level IV, and 70% for Level V. There was a correlation between Clark's level of invasion and survival aftter surgery. The 5-year cure rate was 100% for Level II, 88% for Level III, 60% for Level IV, and 15% for Level V melanoma. The presence of nodal metastases augured a much worse prognosis than Clark's level per se. In patients with Level IV melanoma, the 5-year cure rate was 82% in patients with negative nodes and 27% in those with nodal metastases after elective node dissection. Microstaging primary melanoma according to Clark's levels serves as a useful standard with which to compare surgical results. In this series of extremity melanomas there was no difference between local recurrence and lymphadenectomy for Level II melanoma. For Level III and Level IV melanoma, wide excision and lymphadenectomy gave higher cure rates than wide excision only, both at 5 and 9 years after surgery. The results were significant only for patients with Level III, however. Use of the measured depth of invasion added significant clinicopathologic information. The incidence of nodal metastases at elective node dissection was 5 to 9% for melanoma showing 0.6 to 2.0 mm of invasion, 22% for melanoma measuring 2.1 to 3.0 mm, and 39% for melanoma invading beyond 3.0 mm. The 5-year cure rate was 100% for melanoma measuring less than 1.0 mm, 83% for melanoma invading 1.1 to 2.0 mm, 58% for lesions measuring 2.1 to 3.0 mm, and 55% for melanoma invading over 3.0 mm.

Although stringently controlled prospective studies have yet to demonstrate the validity of these factors for the determination of optimal surgical treatment in individual cases, newer statistical methods of multivariate analysis have made possible assessment of the relative importance of each of these histologic characteristics. The most important and reproducible factor for predicting survival is maximum tumor thickness. Consensus also supports ulceration as another important, independent prognostic indicator, whereas growth pattern and level of invasion derive most of their prognostic value from a secondary correlation with tumor thickness.

We previously demonstrated that a high endogenous interleukin-6 (IL-6) level is significantly correlated with a high tumour burden and resistance to biochemotherapy in metastatic malignant melanoma patients. However, little is known about the origin of IL-6 and the pattern of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) expression. In this report, we studied the expression of IL-6R and intracellular IL-6 using flow cytometry in tumour cells provided by fine-needle aspiration of lymph nodes and palpable metastatic lesions from 14 patients refractory to biochemotherapy and six responder patients. Moreover, we established the relationship between these parameters and the serum IL-6 level. Our results demonstrated that, following treatment, the percentage of HMB45-positive (HMB45+) cells expressing functional IL-6R, intracellular IL-6 or both IL-6R and IL-6 significantly decreased in patients refractory to biochemotherapy. In contrast, in responder patients the percentage of HMB45+ cells expressing IL-6R increased and those expressing IL-6 remained stable. Regarding the serum IL-6 level, an 11-fold increase was observed in the patients refractory to biochemotherapy, but only a 1.8-fold increase in the responder patients. In conclusion, in metastatic malignant melanoma patients with a poor prognosis, the endogenous production of IL-6 is concomitant with a decrease in functional IL-6R and intracellular IL-6 expression, suggesting the involvement of an IL-6/IL-6R complex.",

Given that the 5-year survival rates for individuals with melanoma are determined primarily by the depth and extent of spread, distress that interferes with seeking treatment has the potential to be life-threatening.;The current study was designed to identify levels of distress present in individuals seeking treatment at a large, Midwestern, multidisciplinary melanoma clinic. It also focused on determining the quality of life, level of anxiety, and coping strategies used by individuals with melanoma before treatment. Given that the course of treatment and outcome for patients with stage IV disease is vastly different from that of patients with stages I to III disease, they were excluded from the study.;Results indicated that most individuals who are presenting to a melanoma clinic do not report a clinically significant level of distress. However, there is some variability in this, with 29% of patients reporting moderate to high levels of distress. Moreover, analyses suggest that distressed individuals are more likely to use maladaptive coping strategies, such as escape-avoidance coping, and to have poorer quality of life.;Although most individuals do not present with significant levels of distress, a significant minority are distressed and rely more heavily on coping strategies that do not benefit them.

However, the specific biological functions of ADAM-9 are still unclear. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of ADAM-9 in melanoma in vivo and in melanoma cell lines in vitro. In melanoma ADAM-9 protein expression appeared to be restricted to the melanoma cells within the invading front. Interestingly, ADAM-9 protein was detected in the melanoma cells and in peritumoral stromal fibroblasts, while it was absent in fibroblasts distal to the tumor site. RNA analysis of melanoma cell lines with different invasive abilities showed ADAM-9 expression in varying amounts in all cell lines, independent of their invasive and metastatic capacities. In MV3 melanoma cells, ADAM-9 expression did not depend on homotypic cell-cell contact and on cell-matrix interaction when the cells were cultured on planar extracellular matrix components. However, we observed downregulation of ADAM-9 mRNA expression upon culture of melanoma cells within 3-dimensional lattices composed of fibrillar type I collagen, whereas culture within gels consisting of the polysaccharide alginate did not alter transcript levels. These results identified fibrillar collagen type I as a key factor in ADAM-9 regulation by cell-matrix interactions. Interestingly, we also observed a 3-fold downregulation of ADAM-9 transcript levels upon treatment with interleukin (IL)-1alpha, a proinflammatory cytokine known to induce expression of other ADAM and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family members. In summary, our data suggest a novel role of fibrillar collagen and of soluble factors for the regulation of ADAM-9 expression in vitro.",

Finally, the inhibition of melanoma cell migration via down-regulation of cathepsin L appears to be independent of cystatin C expression.;This study shows that cathepsin L facilitates high metastatic B16 melanoma cell invasion and migration.

Recently, the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab has demonstrated clinical efficacy, being the first agent to significantly prolong the overall survival of inoperable stage III/IV melanoma patients. A major aim of patient immune monitoring is the identification of biomarkers that predict clinical outcome. We studied circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in ipilimumab-treated patients to detect alterations in the myeloid cell compartment and possible correlations with clinical outcome. Lin(-) CD14(+) HLA-DR(-) monocytic MDSC were enriched in peripheral blood of melanoma patients compared to healthy donors (HD). Tumor resection did not significantly alter MDSC frequencies. During ipilimumab treatment, MDSC frequencies did not change significantly compared to baseline levels. We observed high inter-patient differences. MDSC frequencies in ipilimumab-treated patients were independent of baseline serum lactate dehydrogenase levels but tended to increase in patients with severe metastatic disease (M1c) compared to patients with metastases in skin or lymph nodes only (M1a), who had frequencies comparable to HD. Interestingly, clinical responders to ipilimumab therapy showed significantly less lin(-) CD14(+) HLA-DR(-) cells as compared to non-responders. The data suggest that the frequency of monocytic MDSC may be used as predictive marker of response, as low frequencies identify patients more likely benefitting from ipilimumab treatment.

Targeted HFt-MSH-PEG NPs accumulated persistently at the level of primary melanoma and with high selectivity with respect to other organs. Melanoma localization of untargeted HFt-PEG NPs, which lack the α-MSH moiety, was less pronounced. Furthermore, HFt-MSH-PEG NPs accumulated to a significantly lower extent and with a different distribution in a diverse type of tumor (TS/A adenocarcinoma), which does not express α-MSH receptors. Finally, in a spontaneous lung metastasis model, HFt-MSH-PEG NPs localized at the metastasis level as well.

As to immunotherapy targeting metastatic melanoma, HLA-A2+ patients were mainly enrolled in the study in Western countries. However, HLA-A24+ melanoma patients-oriented immunotherapy has not been fully investigated. In the present study, we investigated the effect of dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy on metastatic melanoma patients with HLA-A2 or A24 genotype. METHODS: Nine cases of metastatic melanoma were enrolled into a phase I study of monocyte-derived dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy. HLA-genotype analysis revealed 4 cases of HLA-A*0201, 1 of A*0206 and 4 of A*2402. Enriched monocytes were obtained using OptiPreptrade mark from leukapheresis products, and then incubated with GM-CSF and IL-4 in a closed serum-free system. After pulsing with a cocktail of 5 melanoma-associated synthetic peptides (gp100, tyrosinase, MAGE-2, MAGE-3 and MART-1 or MAGE-1) restricted to HLA-A2 or A24 and KLH, cells were cryopreserved until used. Finally, thawed DCs were washed and injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the inguinal region in a dose-escalation manner. RESULTS: The mean percentage of DCs rated as lin-HLA-DR+ in melanoma patients was 46.4 +/- 15.6 %. Most of DCs expressed high level of co-stimulatory molecules and type1 phenotype (CD11c+HLA-DR+), while a moderate number of mature DCs with CD83 and CCR7 positive were contained in DC products. DC injections were well tolerated except for transient liver dysfunction (elevation of transaminases, Grade I-II). All 6 evaluable cases except for early PD showed positive immunological responses to more than 2 melanoma peptides in an ELISPOT assay. Two representative responders demonstrated strong HLA-class I protein expression in the tumor and very high scores of ELISPOT that might correlate to the regression of metastatic tumors. Clinical response through DC injections was as follows : 1CR, 1 PR, 1SD and 6 PD. All 59 DC injections in the phase I study were tolerable in terms of safety, however, the maximal tolerable dose of DCs was not determined. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that peptide cocktail-treated DC-based immunotherapy had the potential for utilizing as one of therapeutic tools against metastatic melanoma in Japan.",

We showed that at the molecular pathway level, the formation of nevi largely resembles transition from normal skin to primary melanoma. Using a combination of bioinformatic machine learning algorithms, we identified 44 characteristic signaling and metabolic pathways connected with the formation of nevi, development of primary melanoma, and its metastases. We created a model describing formation and progression of melanoma at the level of molecular pathway activation. We discovered six novel associations between activation of metabolic molecular pathways and progression of melanoma: for allopregnanolone biosynthesis, L-carnitine biosynthesis, zymosterol biosynthesis (inhibited in melanoma), fructose 2, 6-bisphosphate synthesis and dephosphorylation, resolvin D biosynthesis (activated in melanoma), D-myo-inositol hexakisphosphate biosynthesis (activated in primary, inhibited in metastatic melanoma). Finally, we discovered fourteen tightly coordinated functional clusters of molecular pathways. This study helps to decode molecular mechanisms underlying the development of melanoma. ",

Immunohistochemistry data further showed that the positive immunoreactivity of RAB22A was detected in 66% (95/144) melanoma tissues, but not in benign nevi. Moreover, high expression of RAB22A was significantly associated with advanced clinical stage in melanoma. Furthermore, patients with high RAB22A expression had shorter overall survival compared those with low expression of RAB22A. In-vitro study showed that RAB22A was also upregulated in melanoma cell lines WM35, A375, WM451, and SK-MEL-1, when compared with the normal melanocyte HM cells. Knockdown of RAB22A significantly reduced the proliferation, migration and invasion of melanoma A375 cells, while overexpression of RAB22A significantly promoted these malignant phenotypes. In addition, RAB22A was found to be a target of miR-203, a tumor suppressive miRNA in melanoma. Besides, miR-203 was downregulated in melanoma tissues and cell lines, when compared with benign nevi and HM cells, respectively.

The results of these latter studies in 51 patients with Stage III (distantly metastatic) melanoma and in five patients with earlier stages of disease indicate that: (1) when the interval from primary therapy to recurrence is greater than one year and when liver, bone and brain are not involved, partial or total clinical regression may be noted in up to 25% of patients with metastatic disease receiving immunochemotherapy; (2) when total regression does occur, the effect usually lasts from one to three years; (3) cytoreductive (debulking) surgery, when possible, in cutaneous, nodal retroperitoneal, and visceral regions may enhance the response to specific active immunochemotherapy, although some debulked patients had less tumor burden and this factor alone may lead to an improved prognosis in patients undergoing any subsequent treatment; (4) when circulating inhibitory factors are modified through preimmunization chemotherapy, an enhanced host response may be seen; and (5) Cancer Serum Indices (CSI) may be useful in predicting recurrence and in following tumor load and response to therapy.

Critical biological features of metastasis include acquisition of migratory competence, growth factor independence, and invasive potential. In an attempt to identify genes that contribute to melanoma pathogenesis, a genome-wide search using bacterial artificial chromosome array comparative genomic hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays in a series of 64 metastatic melanoma samples and 20 melanoma cell lines identified increased copy numbers of Gab2 located on 11q14.1. Gab2 is an adaptor protein that potentiates the activation of the Ras-Erk and PI3K-Akt pathways and has recently been implicated in human cancer; however, its role in melanoma has not been explored. In this study, we found that Gab2 was either amplified (approximately 11%) and/or overexpressed (approximately 50%) in melanoma. Gab2 protein expression correlated with clinical melanoma progression, and higher levels of expression were seen in metastatic melanomas compared with primary melanoma and melanocytic nevi. We found that overexpression of Gab2 potentiates, whereas silencing of Gab2 reduces, migration and invasion of melanoma cells. Gab2 mediated the hyperactivation of Akt signaling in the absence of growth factors, whereas inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway decreased Gab2-mediated tumor cell migration and invasive potential. Gab2 overexpression resulted in enhanced tumor growth and metastatic potential in vivo. These studies demonstrate a previously undefined role for Gab2 in melanoma tumor progression and metastasis.",

Melan-A, tyrosinase and gp100 expression was frequently reduced in melanoma cell cultures, compared to that in foreskin melanocytes, whereas MAGE-1 and MAGE-3 expression showed variable degree of upregulation, compared to that in foreskin melanocytes. The expression of all tested MAA demonstrated high interindividual variability. We further show that cell cultures derived from the same tissue sample are oligoclonal in nature, by demonstrating the presence of up to three cell populations bearing distinct MAA profile. Analysing samples derived from the same patient but each at a different time point, we show that MAA expression profile changes over time either in positive (increase) or in negative (decrease) direction. Finally, we demonstrate that brain metastasis-derived cell cultures significantly overexpress Melan-A and MAGE-3, compared to primary tumours and other metastatic sites (P-value range: 0.05-0.001).

A melanoma disease model was developed in order to predict the evolution of patients from diagnosis until death. The model was applied to a large cohort of 8016 melanoma patients recorded by the Belgian Cancer Registry for incidence years 2009-2011. DALYs were calculated for each American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, considering stage at diagnosis on the one hand and time spent in localised, node metastatic and visceral metastatic stages on the other. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were performed to explore uncertainty.;Our analyses resulted in 3.67 DALYs per melanoma, 90.81 per 100,000 inhabitants, or 32.67 per death due to melanoma. The total YLL accounted for 80.4% of the total DALY. Stages I, II, III and IV patients at diagnosis generated, respectively, 27.8%, 32.7%, 26.2% and 13.3% of the total YLL. For the time spent in each stage, localised melanomas, node metastatic melanomas, and distant metastatic accounted, respectively, for 34.8%, 52.6% and 12.6% of the total YLD. Parametric uncertainty was very limited, but the influence of using pre-2010 Global Burden of Disease approaches was substantial.;The total DALY for melanoma was consistent with the previous studies. Our results in terms of proportions of DALY/YLL/YLD per stage could be extrapolated to other high-income countries.

To elucidate the role of HLA class II expression in the immunopathogenesis of melanoma, the authors compared HLA class II+ melanoma cells to autologous B cells with respect to their ability to stimulate primary (naïve) histoincompatible lymphocytes and T-cell clones (antigen experienced). Using primary lymphocytes (peripheral blood lymphocytes [PBLs]), melanoma cells were nonstimulatory when compared to autologous B cells. To determine whether this was caused by defective antigen processing, the authors used alloreactive T-cell clones, which require alloantigen presentation by a histocompatible stimulator cell but not costimulation. Melanoma cells stimulated the alloreactive T-cell clones in two of three clones tested, indicating that they processed and presented alloantigen. To determine whether the failure of melanoma cells to stimulate primary lymphocytes was caused by their inability to costimulate the T cells, the authors transduced the melanoma cells with B7.1 and achieved stable expression in more than 95% of the cells. The transduced cells were highly stimulatory, eliciting a 17- to 25-fold increase in proliferation by the peripheral blood lymphocytes compared with controls. Indeed, B7-expressing melanoma cells were more stimulatory than autologous B cells, which elicited an 11- to 15-fold increase compared with controls. These data indicate that melanoma cells fail to stimulate primary lymphocytes because they do not deliver costimulatory signals. Engineering HLA class II+ melanoma cells to express high levels of B7.1 may provide a way to elicit primary T-cell responses to melanoma-associated antigens.",

In side-by-side experiments, we show that melanoma cells, either allogeneic or autologous, induced the growth of high avidity Melan-A-reactive CTLs from all donors, whereas essentially low avidity T cells were induced by peptide-pulsed PBLs. We also show that at least two cytokines, interleukin-6 and interleukin-2, were required to promote the growth of high avidity CTLs. Once sorted by tetramer labeling or cloning, the specificity and reactivity to tumor cells of peptide-specific T cells induced by allogeneic melanoma cells were confirmed. We then describe a relatively simple and efficient procedure that allowed us to obtain systematically high amounts (in the range of billion) of high avidity Melan-A/ MART-1-specific T cells from the PBLs of HLA-A2 melanoma patients and healthy donors in 3 months. Because this antigen is expressed by most melanoma tumors, this procedure should be useful for checking the efficiency of adoptive immunotherapy of melanoma tumors and using functionally well-defined Melan-A/MART-1-specific CTLs in a large group of patients.",

By contrast, little is known regarding addiction to glutamine. Using five melanoma lines and two normal cell types, addition of aminooxyacetate (AOA), an inhibitor of glutamate-dependent transaminase regulating glutaminolytic pathway, two lines underwent low levels of apoptosis (>30%), while the other three lines were resistant, as were normal cells to AOA. However, three resistant lines (but not normal cells), became sensitized to undergoing apoptosis when TRAIL was combined with AOA. TRAIL by itself had minimal effects on all cell lines and normal cells, and did not augment AOA-induced killing in the two sensitive melanoma lines. AOA plus TRAIL induced a caspase-dependent apoptotic response. AOA did not influence TRAIL DR4 or DR5 cell surface death receptor levels, but AOA enhanced pro-apoptotic protein levels of Noxa, while reducing pro-survival protein Mcl-1. To verify AOA was targeting glutamine pathway, depletion of glutamine produced similar results, because absence of glutamine sensitized three melanoma lines, but not fibroblasts to killing by TRAIL. Glutamine depletion also led to Noxa induction. These results indicate some lines are addicted to glutamine, and treatment with AOA or glutamine depletion sensitizes melanoma to TRAIL-mediated killing, while sparing normal cells. Future studies are indicated to translate these discoveries to metastatic melanoma as there is currently no treatment available to prolong survival.",

In the present study we investigated the involvement of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) in uveal melanoma migration, invasion and adhesion, the hallmarks of aggressive behavior of cancer cells. We demonstrate that exposure to hypoxia increased migration, invasion and adhesion of uveal melanoma cells in in vitro assays. The \"silencing\" of HIF-1alpha, the oxygen-regulated subunit of HIF-1, using RNA interference technology resulted in a marked decrease of the uveal melanoma cell migration, invasion and adhesion. GeneChip microarray analysis revealed that a number of genes which regulate cancer invasion and metabolism such as CXCR4, angiopoietin-related protein, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) are also activated by hypoxia in a HIF-1-dependent manner in Mum2B uveal melanoma cells. We further demonstrate that serum deprivation resulted in HIF-1 and CXCR4 activation, suggesting specific metabolic regulation of HIF-1 in these cells. Microarray analysis of serum-deprived cells identified among the upregulated genes a number of cancer invasion-related genes, some of them being known HIF-1-regulated targets. Taken together, these results suggest that the involvement of HIF-1 in uveal melanoma tumorigenesis is significant and complex, and that metabolic regulation of HIF-1 activation in Mum2B uveal melanoma cells has its specificities.",

MGSA has been purified from acetic acid extracts of lyophilized conditioned medium by gel filtration, reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and preparative electrophoresis, resulting in a greater than 400,000-fold purification. MGSA bioactivity resides in acid- and heat-stable polypeptides of high and low molecular weight (24-28 kd and less than 14-16 kd). However, the majority of the activity is reproducibly associated with the approximately 16-kd moiety eluting from RP-HPLC at approximately 35% acetonitrile. Reduction with dithiothreitol or B-mercaptoethanol results in a loss of biological activity but does not convert the 24-28-kd moieties to the less than 14-16-kd forms of MGSA. 125I-MGSA that has been purified by preparative electrophoresis (16 kd) specifically binds to Hs0294 melanoma cells and retains 100% of the growth-stimulatory activity. The 16-kd MGSA stimulates the proliferation of Hs0294 cells at concentrations of 0.3-30 pM. The electrophoretic mobility of MGSA is also unaltered by the preparative electrophoresis procedure, further demonstrating that this procedure does not alter the biochemical integrity of the growth factor. Purified MGSA does not enable anchorage-independent growth of normal rat kidney (NRK) cells and is therefore different from the previously described transforming growth factors. The amino acid composition of MGSA differs from that of other previously described growth factors.

They were characterized for Aldh1a1 activity, stem cell markers and migration and invasion in vitro. Their tumorigenicity in vivo was analyzed using xenografts and lung metastasis assays as well as in vivo imaging.;Depletion of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 (Aldh1a1) impairs the pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic advantage of melanoma cells lacking AhR expression (sh-AhR). Thus, Aldh1a1 knockdown in sh-AhR cells (sh-AhR + sh-Aldh1a1) diminished their migration and invasion potentials and blocked tumor growth and metastasis to the lungs in immunocompetent AhR+/+ recipient mice. However, Aldh1a1 downmodulation in AhR-expressing B16F10 cells did not significantly affect tumor growth in vivo. Aldh1a1 knockdown reduced the high levels of CD133(+)/CD29(+)/CD44(+) cells, melanosphere size and the expression of the pluripotency marker Sox2 in sh-AhR cells. Interestingly, Sox2 increased Aldh1a1 expression in sh-AhR but not in sh-AhR + sh-Aldh1a1 cells, suggesting that Aldh1a1 and Sox2 may be co-regulated in melanoma cells.

Gene expression was used to determine class 1 and class 2 signatures in the primary tumors. Short hairpin RNA was used to downregulate the expressions of the EMT factors; then, growth and transwell invasion assays were performed.;ZEB1, Twist1, and Snail1 were expressed in all five uveal melanoma lines, with ZEB1 having the highest protein levels. ZEB1 mRNA was significantly elevated in highly metastatic class 2 primary tumors for which survival data were not available, whereas a high gene expression of Twist1 was associated with a worse prognosis in a separate tumor cohort analyzed by expression profiling. The genetic downregulation of ZEB1 in OCM1, OMM1, and 92.1 resulted in a more than 50% reduction in invasion, but only suppressed growth in OMM1 cells.

In recent years, a substantial number of reports on individual miRNAs or miRNA patterns have been published providing strong evidence that miRNAs might play an important role in malignant melanoma and might help to better understand the molecular mechanisms of melanoma development and progression. A major preliminary finding was that melanoma-associated miRNAs are often located in genomic regions with frequent gains and losses in tumours. Detailed studies of different groups thereafter identified miRNAs with differential expression in benign melanocytes compared with melanoma cell lines or in benign melanocytic lesions compared with melanomas. Among these were let-7a and b, miR-23a and b, miR-148, miR-155, miR-182, miR-200c, miR-211, miR214, and miR-221 and 222. Some of these miRNAs target well-known melanoma-associated genes like the NRAS oncogene, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT or AP-2 transcription factors (TFAP2). Although we are still far from a complete understanding of the role of miRNA-target gene interactions in malignant melanoma, these findings further underscore the notion of a direct involvement of miRNAs in melanoma biology. Very recently, a prognostic signature of six miRNAs has been identified consisting of miRNAs miR-150, miR-342-3p, miR-455-3p, miR-145, miR-155, and miR-497. High expression of these miRNAs was shown to be associated with improved long-term survival of metastatic patients.",

B16 melanoma cells under continuous culture conditions show a phenotypic drift from melanotic to amelanotic and re-melanotic stages. We have investigated the regulation of gamma-GT in B16 melanoma cells under such different pigmentary conditions. High levels of gamma-GT messenger RNA (mRNA) and activity were detected in pigmented B16 melanoma cells, whereas in amelanotic B16 melanoma cells the levels were very low. Treatment with lactic acid, a known inhibitor of tyrosinase gene expression, also led to the down-regulation of gamma-GT mRNA and activity. Thus our results indicate that gamma-GT regulation depends on the pigmentation status in pigment cells. We have also assessed the levels of gamma-GT in normal murine melanocytes (melan-a cells). It was seen that melan-a cells express very low levels of gamma-GT. As gamma-GT is known to be regulated in a tissue-specific manner, and is expressed from as many as six promoters giving rise to six different types of mRNAs each having unique 5' ends, we have further investigated the type of gamma-GT mRNA expressed in B16 melanoma and melan-a cells.

The paradox of increasing incidence and decreasing mortality rates is discussed, also from the view of the histopathologist. Melanoma patients are at increased risk for subsequent skin carcinoma (basalioma/spinalioma) and vice versa. This may be explained by the common risk factor: sun exposure.

It is controversial whether worldwide increases in melanoma incidence represent a true epidemic but at the same time that dramatic increase in incidence occur in setting of relatively stable mortality trends, observed in Croatia also. The majority of authors accept that main risk factors for melanoma relate to environmental exposure and genetics with epidemiologic studies linking sun exposure to melanoma development. Data were obtained from Croatian cancer register for patients diagnosed between 1999 and 2008, for malignant melanoma of the skin (ICD-10 code C43) at national level and from 2003 to 2008, at the County level (Primorsko-goranska County). Melanoma incidence nearly doubled in males from 8.75 to 13.4/10(5) per year, fold in females from 9.1 at the start of observation to the end of 12.0/10(5) per year in Croatia. Melanoma incidence rates were much more higher for Primorsko-goranska County with range from 10.1 to 17.5/10(5) per year. The greatest increase of melanoma incidence rates was in males 60 years and over year group at diagnosis. National comparison of variation in cancer incidence by region and age can provide basis for public health prevention. It requires the integration of information on risk factors, incidence that could help to reduce regional inequalities in incidence and reduce the future cancer incidence.",

CD271-expressing melanoma cells in murine xenografts give rise to metastatic tumor. However, a comprehensive clinical investigation of its role in different stages of melanomagenesis has not been well studied. We studied CD271 expression with immunohistochemistry in 11 cases of banal melanocytic nevus, 9 cases of primary cutaneous melanoma, 10 cases of primary mucosal melanoma, 5 cases of metastatic melanoma in regional lymph nodes, and 11 cases of metastatic melanoma in the brain. In addition, 9 cases of metastatic, high-grade adenocarcinomas from breast and lung to the brain were studied as controls. The staining was scored based on the number of positive cells and analyzed by student t-test. All banal melanocytic nevi showed negative to equivocal staining. Primary cutaneous melanomas showed variable patterns, mucosal melanomas were mostly negative, and metastases to lymph nodes ranged from negative to moderate positivity. In contrast, all 11 cases of metastatic melanoma to the brain showed moderate (4 cases) to strong positivity (7 cases). Metastases from lung and breast origin were used as controls and showed negative to weakly positive staining in all but one case. Statistically, CD271 has significantly increased expression in metastatic melanoma to the brain when compared to the other groups studied (P < 0.05). The findings suggest that CD271 expression is specifically increased in metastatic melanoma to the brain. Further prospective study for the role of CD271 in prediction of melanoma brain metastasis as well as prognosis assessment will be of great clinical significance. ",

Some of the signet-ring cells exhibited cytoplasmatic periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positivity. Immunohistochemistry showed positive reaction of the tumor cells for S-100, HMB-45 protein and vimentin, confirming their melanocytic differentiation. Tumor cells were negative for cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).

The validity of case-reported family history of melanoma was assessed in the course of a family and twin study of melanoma in Queensland, Australia, conducted among the families of 2,118 melanoma cases diagnosed in Queensland between 1982 and 1990. A total of 913 melanoma cases made 1,267 reports of melanoma among their first-degree relatives. A total of 1,040 of these reports were checked, first through relatives themselves and then, if the relative also said they had had melanoma, through the relative's medical records. Medical confirmation of melanoma as the diagnosis was obtained for 623 reports (59.9%; 95% confidence interval 56.9-62.9): a false-positive reporting rate by cases of 40.1%. The level of false-positive reporting was lower for cases under 70 years of age, for women, for cases whose own diagnosis of melanoma was more than 5 years earlier, and for cases with three or more relatives with melanoma. Media campaigns in Queensland aimed at increasing skin cancer awareness, and confusion between melanoma and other more common actinic neoplasma (basal and squamous cell carcinomas), may partly explain the high false-positive reporting rate observed here. For this reason, It is difficult to generalize these findings to northern hemisphere populations where skin cancer is not such an important public health issue.",

However, sometimes, discrimination between dysplastic nevi and early melanomas is difficult, even for experienced pathologists. Besides histology, the silencing of tumor suppressor genes aids in the diagnosis of melanoma. We have shown previously that tumor suppressor in lung cancer 1 (TSLC1) is a tumor suppressor gene, and its silencing through aberrant promoter methylation is associated with the generation of cutaneous melanoma. To examine TSLC1 expression in melanocytic skin lesions to determine whether it can serve as a diagnostic marker in histologically questionable lesions. Cytoplasmic localization of the expression of the TSLC1 gene was detected by immunohistochemistry; the levels of TSLC1 mRNA and protein were detected by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR and western blot, respectively. Using immunohistochemistry, the average TSLC1 expression levels in cutaneous melanomas decreased approximately 3.6-fold (n=20) as compared with dysplastic nevi (n=30) and 3.7-fold as compared with normal skin (n=25). The average expression levels of TSLC1 mRNA and protein in dysplastic nevi lesions and normal skin were significantly higher than the levels in cutaneous melanomas. No significant changes in TSLC1 mRNA and protein expressions were found between normal skin and dysplastic nevi. Our results show that a loss of TSLC1 frequently occurs in cutaneous melanoma, and indicate that it could serve as a diagnostic marker for cutaneous melanoma in histologically questionable lesions.",

In recent years, the advent of genomic technologies has brought the promise of identification of germline DNA alterations that may associate with CM outcomes and hence represent novel biomarkers for clinical utilization. This review attempts to summarize the current state of knowledge of germline genetic factors studied for their impact on melanoma clinical outcomes.

After density gradient centrifugation, the interphase was incubated with the 9.2.27 antibody. Positive cells were labeled with magnetic microbeads and enriched by immunomagnetic cell sorting. Cells were stained using an alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase assay and examined by light microscopy.

The treated tumor cells also became immunogenic and were rejected in 70% of syngeneic C57BL/6 recipients, whereas these tumor cells produced progressively growing tumors in 100% of irradiated (550 R) or nude mice. In contrast to the effects of N-methyl-N'-nitronitrosoguanidine treatment, no influence of H-2 antigen expression or tumorigenicity was found when BL6 melanoma cells were treated with 5-azacytidine, phorbol myristate acetate, 5-bromodeoxyuridine, theophylline, or 6-thioguanine. H-2 antigen expression and the tumorigenic properties of 48 individual clones derived from BL6T2 melanoma line and 15 clones from the original BL6 melanoma were investigated. No H-2 antigens were found on the cell surface of the parental BL6 clones, whereas all tum- clones from the BL6T2 line expressed high levels of H-2 antigens. Although four of six tested tum+ clones had high levels of H-2b antigen expression similar to that of tum- clones, they were nonimmunogenic. These data indicate that an increase in major histocompatibility complex antigen expression is essential but not sufficient for the immunogenicity of tumor cells. This conclusion was also supported by the results of interferon treatment of BL6 melanoma cells: this induced an increase in the expression of beta 2-microglobulin and Class 1 H-2b antigens but not an increase in their immunogenicity. Detection of tumor-associated transplantation antigens on the melanoma cells also appeared to be dependent on the level of expression of H-2 antigens. Although tum+ clones grew in normal mice, immune mice were able to prevent the growth of tum+ clones with high levels of H-2 antigens. However, immune mice only partially inhibited the growth of the parental BL6 melanoma or tum+ clones which have low expression of H-2 antigens.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Transplant-related malignancies are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in the organ-recipient population, and most often develop de novo in the immunosuppressed recipient or as recurrent malignancy after transplantation. The least common scenario, and a rare event, is a recipient malignancy derived from the donor organ. Melanoma is one of the most often reported and lethal donor-derived malignancies with a high transmission rate. Donor transmission of melanoma might be related to the biology of melanoma, with regard to tumour dormancy, late recurrence, circulating tumour cells, and the destiny of some micrometastases. Melanoma-cell dormancy explains the late recurrence that can occur after the initial treatment of melanoma, and may be relevant to our understanding and management of some melanoma micrometastasis in the sentinel node. The high incidence of circulating tumour cells in early melanoma should be considered in the context of the transmission of melanoma by apparent disease-free organ donors following removal of a primary melanoma up to 32 years before. This scenario suggests that melanoma cells can remain dormant at distant sites for decades (and possibly forever) in immunocompetent patients, only to reactivate after transplantation into an immunosuppressed recipient. Potential organ donors should be carefully screened for a history of melanoma, and excluded. The current recommendation for treatment of donor-related melanoma includes withdrawal of immunosuppression, graft rejection, and explantation of the allograft after rejection has been established. In non-renal transplant patients with life-sustaining organs, withdrawal of immunosuppression and graft rejection is not feasible, and reduction of immunosuppression or urgent retransplantation are the only possible salvage strategies. The transmission of malignancy by organ donation could be considered \"nature's own experiment\", but raises questions that our current understanding of the biology of melanoma cannot answer.",

Several clinical factors (number of invaded lymph nodes and/or presence of distant metastases) and histopathology (depth of tumor and presence of ulceration) are available to the clinician for determining prognosis and suggesting appropriate therapeutic management. However, these factors are often insufficient, especially in early forms of melanoma. Much research has focused on the identification of effective prognostic markers in serum. The only serum marker, which has been incorporated into the current AJCC classification for clinical use is lactate dehydrogenase dosage, a historical marker, restricted to the prognosis of metastatic disease. The recent development of technologies for proteome analysis offers new perspectives in this field.

In total, 700 individuals (136 patients with a positive family history and 164 with at least two primary melanomas as the high-risk groups; 200 with single primary melanomas; and 200 healthy individuals as the control groups) were Sanger sequenced for CDKN2A exon 1α, 1β, and 2.

We found the disease-associated mutations p.R24P (8×), p.N71T (1×), p.G101W (1×), and p.V126D (1×) in the group with affected relatives and p.R24P (2×) in the group with several primary melanomas. Furthermore, we discovered four mutations of unknown significance, two of which were novel: p.A34V and c.151-4 G>C, respectively. Computational effect prediction suggested p.A34V as conferring a high risk for melanoma, whereas c.151-4 G>C, although being predicted as a splice site mutation by MutationTaster, could not functionally be confirmed to alter splicing. Moreover, computational effect prediction confirmed accumulation of high-penetrance mutations in high-risk groups, whereas mutations of unknown significance were distributed across all groups. p.R24P is the most common high-risk mutation in Austria.

Here, using B16F0 melanoma cells stably expressing CCL21 under the control of cytomegalovirus and ubiquitin promoters, we showed that CCL21-activated immune responses depend on the amount of melanoma-derived chemokine, which, in turn, depends on the strength of the promoter. We showed that ubiquitin promoter-driven expression of CCL21 enabled massive infiltration of tumors with CD4(+)CD25(-), CD8(+) T lymphocytes, and CD11c(+) dendritic cells, and consequent activation of cellular and humoral immune responses sufficient for complete rejection of CCL21-positive melanomas within 3 weeks in all tumor-inoculated mice. Mice that rejected CCL21-positive tumors acquired protective immunity against melanoma, which was transferable to naive mice via splenocytes and central memory T cells. Moreover, melanoma-derived CCL21 facilitated immune-mediated remission of preestablished, distant wild-type melanomas. Overall, these results suggest that elevated levels of tumor-derived CCL21 are required for the activation of strong melanoma-specific immune responses and generation of protective immunologic memory. They also open new perspectives for the development of novel vaccination strategies against melanoma, which use intratumoral delivery of the optimized CCL21-encoding vectors in conjunction with DNA-based vaccines.",

This trend is suspected to be due to better detection and removal of thin, biological early melanomas. However, to date, no prospective evidence exists to clearly demonstrate the efficacy of prevention and early detection in decreasing melanoma mortlity. Nonetheless, many studies suggest that both self-assessment of risk factors or clinician examination can identify a proportion of patients at highest risk for melanoma who may benefit from behavior modification (primary prevention) and routine screening (secondary prevention). Compromising these goals is the fact that neither the clinical or histologic diagnosis of melanoma is 100% accurate. Clinical diagnosis of melanoma, based on evaluation of a skin lesion's color and shape, correlates best with the experience of the clinician. Ancillary technologies have been developed to improve clinical accuracy of suspicious skin lesions but a subset of melanomas exist that do not fall in the spectrum of the 'ABCDE' guidelines commonly used for melanoma identification. Similarly, at the histologic level (the 'gold standard' of diagnosis), overlap exists between benign and malignant melanocytic proliferations leading to both over and underdiagnosis of melanoma. A better understanding of melanoma's pathogenesis has identified disease-related biomarkers that may more reliably differentiate a melanocytic nevus from melanoma. In this paper, we review current and novel, potentially more accurate, biomarkers and supplementary technologies that can be used for the prevention, screening and diagnosis of melanoma.",

Similarly, the sTG level of the patients with nodal metastases increased between weeks 2 and 16 after the first vaccine treatment; by week 24, it had returned to pretreatment level in patients who survived more than 56 weeks but remained significantly elevated (p(2) < 0.01) in patients who survived less than 56 weeks. The sTG level increased between weeks 2 and 16 in all vaccine recipients and returned to prevaccine level by week 24 in all who showed measurable regression of in-transit melanoma (7 of 17 patients) or improved overall survival (53 of 70 patients). The data suggest that sTG level could be a potential tool for assessing the response to immunotherapy in melanoma patients by week 24.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the status of microRNA-21 expression in human cutaneous malignant melanoma and determine its clinical significance. TaqMan(®) real-time RT-PCR assay was performed to examine the expression of microRNA-21 in 10 cases of dysplastic nevi, 86 cases of primary cutaneous melanomas, 10 cases of melanoma metastases. The correlation of microRNA-21 expression with clinicopathological factors or prognosis of patients with cutaneous melanoma was statistically analyzed. Additionally, the effects of microRNA-21 expression on growth, apoptosis and chemo- or radiosensitivity of melanoma cells were also investigated by transfection of microRNA-21 inhibitor. We firstly showed that increased levels of microRNA-21 expression were shown from dysplastic nevi to primary cutaneous melanomas to melanoma metastases. Moreover, high miR-21 expression was found to be correlated with Breslow thickness and advanced clinical stage. Patients with high microRNA-21 expression showed shorter 5-year disease-free or overall survival than those with low microRNA-21 expression. Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis showed that the status of microRNA-21 expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival of patients. Antisense-mediated microRNA-21 inhibition could significantly suppress growth, increase apoptosis and enhance chemo- or radiosensitivity of human cutaneous melanoma cells by inducing the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Thus, the status of microRNA-21 might be an independent prognostic factor for patients with cutaneous melanoma, and microRNA-21 has the potential of being a novel molecular target for the treatment of human cutaneous melanoma.",

Several studies have shown that young people often have amelanotic tumors resembling pyogenic granuloma. This correlates with a histopathological high number of nodular melanomas in this age group. A reason might be a delay in the clinical diagnosis of malignant melanoma in children and young adults. Clinical and histopathological examples of melanoma in young people are demonstrated.

        "Doc_abstract":"Melanoma is a cancer with rising incidence and new therapeutics are needed. For this, it is necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms of melanoma development and progression. Melanoma differs from other cancers by its ability to produce the pigment melanin via melanogenesis; this biosynthesis is essentially regulated by microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). MITF regulates various processes such as cell cycling and differentiation. MITF shows an ambivalent role, since high levels inhibit cell proliferation and low levels promote invasion. Hence, well-balanced MITF homeostasis is important for the progression and spread of melanoma. Therefore, it is difficult to use MITF itself for targeted therapy, but elucidating its complex regulation may lead to a promising melanoma-cell specific therapy.;We systematically analyzed the regulation of MITF with a novel established transcription factor based gene regulatory network model. Starting from comparative transcriptomics analysis using data from cells originating from nine different tumors and a melanoma cell dataset, we predicted the transcriptional regulators of MITF employing ChIP binding information from a comprehensive set of databases. The most striking regulators were experimentally validated by functional assays and an MITF-promoter reporter assay. Finally, we analyzed the impact of the expression of the identified regulators on clinically relevant parameters of melanoma, i.e. the thickness of primary tumors and patient overall survival.;Our model predictions identified SOX10 and SOX5 as regulators of MITF. We experimentally confirmed the role of the already well-known regulator SOX10. Additionally, we found that SOX5 knockdown led to MITF up-regulation in melanoma cells, while double knockdown with SOX10 showed a rescue effect; both effects were validated by reporter assays. Regarding clinical samples, SOX5 expression was distinctively up-regulated in metastatic compared to primary melanoma. In contrast, survival analysis of melanoma patients with predominantly metastatic disease revealed that low SOX5 levels were associated with a poor prognosis.;MITF regulation by SOX5 has been shown only in murine cells, but not yet in human melanoma cells. SOX5 has a strong inhibitory effect on MITF expression and seems to have a decisive clinical impact on melanoma during tumor progression.",

Upon IFN treatment, the relationship is obliterated and (2'-5')oligoadenylate synthetase levels increase throughout all phases of the cell cycle.

L-Tyrosine oxidation product(s) increased the frequency of micronuclei in melanoma cells; 0.1 mM phenylthiourea (PTU), an inhibitor of L-tyrosine oxidation by tyrosinase, lowered the micronucleus production to the control levels. The culture of melanoma cells with high L-tyrosine in the culture medium resulted in a positive response to an ELISA-based apoptotic test. For comparison the effect of L-tyrosine on micronuclei production in human amelanotic melanoma cells was also investigated; the micronucleus production in the presence of 1 mM L-tyrosine in the culture medium was lower than that found with melanotic melanoma cells of the same cell line. The data suggest that melanin synthesis intermediates arising from L-tyrosine oxidation may cause micronuclei production in Carl-1 human melanoma cells; the addition of PTU in the presence of L-tyrosine decreased the frequency of micronuclei to about the control values thus the inhibition of melanogenesis may have some clinical implication in melanotic melanoma.",

Expression of MAAs such as MART-1 and gp100 is modulated by the MAPK signaling pathway, which is often deregulated in melanoma. The protein BRAF, a member of the MAPK pathway, is mutated in over 60% of melanomas providing an opportunity for the identification and approval by the FDA of a small molecule MAPK signaling inhibitor PLX4032 that functions to inactivate mutant BRAF(V600E). To this end, we characterized five patient derived primary melanoma cell lines with respect to treatment with PLX4032. Cells were treated with 5μM PLX4032 and harvested. Western blotting analysis, RT-PCR and in vitro transwell migration and invasion assays were utilized to determine treatment effects. PLX4032 treatment modulated phosphorylation of signaling proteins belonging to the MAPK pathway including BRAF, MEK, and ERK and abrogated cell phenotypic characteristics such as migration and invasion. Most significantly, PLX4032 led to an up regulation of many MAA proteins in three of the four BRAF mutated cell lines, as determined at the protein and RNA level. Interestingly, MAGE-A1 protein and mRNA levels were reduced upon PLX4032 treatment in two of the primary lines. Taken together, our findings suggest that the BRAF(V600E) inhibitor PLX4032 has therapeutic potential over and above its known target and in combination with specific melanoma targeting vaccine strategies may have further clinical utility.

A paraneoplastic autoimmune manifestation of this disease is melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR). MAR has been associated with prolonged survival and may be an early marker of tumor progression. By screening a retina and a melanoma cDNA phage library by SEREX using sera of patients suffering from melanoma and, in some cases, clinical symptoms of MAR, we identified 20 new antigens (HD-MM-28-47), of which 14 clones had high homology to well-known genes. Six of these genes had previously been associated with retina: rhodopsin, visual arrestin, MEK1, SRPX, BBS1 and galectin-3. Individual clones were recognized by up to 43% of patients' sera, while sera of healthy volunteers were negative except in 2 cases. The expression profile of the antigens identified on the basis of homologous EST database entries in healthy tissues was ubiquitous to differential. Using RT-PCR, we found frequent expression of preselected antigens in melanoma cell lines. For rhodopsin, this could be quantified by quantitative PCR. Retinal proteins were recognized by serum antibodies of melanoma patients but not healthy controls. The role of these antigens in MAR awaits further investigation.

SKI is upregulated in human malignant melanoma tumors in a disease-progression manner and its overexpression promotes proliferation and migration of melanoma cells in vitro. The mechanisms by which SKI antagonizes TGF-beta signaling in vivo have not been fully elucidated. Here we show that human melanoma cells in which endogenous SKI expression was knocked down by RNAi produced minimal orthotopic tumor xenograft nodules that displayed low mitotic rate and prominent apoptosis. These minute tumors exhibited critical signatures of active TGF-beta signaling including high levels of nuclear Smad3 and p21(Waf-1), which are not found in the parental melanomas. To understand how SKI promotes tumor growth we used gain- and loss-of-function approaches and found that simultaneously to blocking the TGF-beta-growth inhibitory pathway, SKI promotes the switch of Smad3 from tumor suppression to oncogenesis by favoring phosphorylations of the Smad3 linker region in melanoma cells but not in normal human melanocytes. In this context, SKI is required for preventing TGF-beta-mediated downregulation of the oncogenic protein c-MYC, and for inducing the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, a mediator of tumor growth and angiogenesis. Together, the results indicate that SKI exploits multiple regulatory levels of the TGF-beta pathway and its deficiency restores TGF-beta tumor suppressor and apoptotic activities in spite of the likely presence of oncogenic mutations in melanoma tumors.",

A mild neuraminidase treatment, which removes sialic acid residues from the cell surface glycoproteins, reduces the EPM of both groups of melanoma cells yielding an electrophoretically uniform population. This shows that the differences in the EPM between the subpopulations of pigmented melanoma cells stem from the different content of sialic acid residues on the cell surface. The relationship between the different EPM melanoma cell subpopulations was, therefore, examined during tumor growth, development, and formation of metastases. The relative content of cells having high electrophoretic mobility, the \"fast moving\" cells, increases as the tumors grow larger. However, tumors of the same diameter contain nearly the same fraction of \"fast moving\" cells despite their age. The proportion of the \"fast moving\" cells is significantly higher in the central part than in the outermost layer of pigmented melanoma tumors. These data suggest that the development of \"fast moving\" cells is promoted by some size-dependent changes in the intratumor environment. In vivo selection of melanoma cells for their ability to colonize lungs renders tumors that reveal elevated metastatic potential and contain a significantly higher fraction of cells possessing high electrophoretic mobility than the parent tumor. Moreover, the metastatic nodules contain a remarkably elevated fraction of the \"fast moving\" cells. The reported correlation between the \"fast moving\" cell fraction and the metastatic potential suggests that the relative content of cells having high electrophoretic mobility may determine the metastaticity of pigmented hamster melanoma.",

Treatment of melanoma-bearing mice with 50, 100, and 200 muCi of (212)Pb[DOTA]-Re(Arg(11))CCMSH extended their mean survival to 22, 28, and 49.8 days, respectively, compared with the 14.6-day mean survival of the placebo control group. Forty-five percent of the mice receiving 200 muCi doses survived the study disease-free.;Treatment of B16/F1 murine melanoma-bearing mice with (212)Pb[DOTA]-Re(Arg(11))CCMSH significantly decreased tumor growth rates resulting in extended mean survival times, and in many cases, complete remission of disease.

The gene product, p53 protein, is normally present in very small amounts in noncancerous tissues. Missense mutations lead to accumulation of mutant p53 in the cells, which makes it detectable immunohistochemically in many cancers. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 14 primary invasive melanomas, 3 cutaneous melanoma metastases, and 10 predominantly intradermal melanocytic nevi were reacted with a panel of three anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (PAb240, PAb1801, and DO7) and a mAb against Ki-67 (MIB-1), a marker of cellular proliferation. p53 was not detected in morphologically normal epidermal melanocytes or nevus cells. A single primary invasive melanoma, having a very high index of proliferation (Ki-67 expression in > 50% of cells), had diffuse nuclear labeling with all three anti-p53 mAbs used.

The results were related to simultaneously performed microcytotoxicity (MC) tests, HL-A typing, plasma membrane fluorescence and B:T cell ratios in the peripheral blood. Furthermore, lymphocytes from six melanoma patients were tested in CMC and ADCC assays against autologous tumour cells. The following results were obtained. (1) A large number of healthy controls possessed lymphocytes which readily lysed M1 target cells in CMC and MC assays. (2) CMC activity of lymphocytes from melanoma patients was generally lower than that of control lymphocytes and decreased further with progression of the disease. (3) CLL lymphocytes were virtually non-toxic for M1 cells, even at high aggressor:target cell ratios. (4) ADCC assays with a heterologous rabbit-anti-M1 serum showed generally higher isotope release than CMC assays; this was particularly pronounced in the melanoma group and in the group of patients with other tumours. (5) No tumour-specific blocking factor could be detected in melanoma sera, as judged by the capacity of the sera to block CMC activity. (6) No obvious correlation was found between the results obtained in short-term CMC and long-term MC assays. (7) T lymphocytes, as determined by E-rosette formation, were significantly diminished in melanoma patients. (8) The HL-A type of lymphocytes from normal donors and melanoma patients did not appear to be related to high or low activity in CMC and MC assays.

The general level of awareness of melanoma in the community was good (74%).

Females were more knowledgeable than males (odds ratio 1.74, 95% CI 1.26-2.22), but continued to sunbathe. Teenagers and young adults tended to be relatively ignorant of melanoma, and were less likely to protect themselves against sunburn while sunbathing than other age groups. Teenagers, young adults, and males need to be targeted more effectively in future publicity campaigns.

Moreover, the studies elucidated some differences in cytotoxic effects between CEINs used as raw and purified materials composing of the carbon surface with acidic groups. Experiments showed that HTB-140 cells are more sensitive to prone early apoptotic events due to raw CEINs as compared to B16-F10 or HDF cells, respectively.

        "Doc_abstract":"Extracutaneous malignant melanomas are rare tumors with vexing clinical presentation and grim prognosis. Only 4%-5% of all primary melanomas do not arise from the skin. These tumors are almost uniformly fatal, even in 2006. Although a fairly good number of these lesions were reported in the literature, the lack of a side-by-side analysis of these studies has resulted in tentative conclusions that merely offer a first glimpse at the clinicopathologic diversity of these lesions. To remedy this issue, this article took an aim at presenting a literature review concerning extracutaneous malignant melanomas. It also reports several cases of extracutaneous melanomas, which I came across in my 15 years of surgical and molecular pathology practice. The study raises several notions. Extracutaneous malignant melanomas are rare but extremely aggressive lesions with a grim outcome. They include ocular, metastatic, anorectal, mucosal, nail beds, conjunctival, vaginal, urogenital, orbital, esophageal, and leptomeningial malignant melanomas. The development of these lesions lacks an association with sun damage, family history, or precursor nevi. These lesions cause considerable diagnostic consternation and their distinction from other types of tumors (such as undifferentiated carcinomas, high-grade sarcomas, and lymphomas) is critical both from a diagnostic and prognostic point of view. In the proper clinical, histological, and cytological context, immunopositivity for S100 protein, HMB45, and vimentin allows the distinction of these malignant melanomas from other histologically similar malignancies. To conclude, extracutaneous melanoma should be considered while undifferentiated neoplasms, especially those displaying prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, and the coexistence of epithelioid and spindle cells. Special staining and immunohistochemistry should be resorted to establish the diagnosis.",

In situ hybridization studies with a probe to the template RNA component of telomerase confirmed that expression was almost exclusively confined to tumor cells and not infiltrating lymphocytes.

Age, sex, anatomic site, stage, level of invasion, regional lymph node metastasis, surgical margin involvement, and treatment modality were also analyzed. In the 33 invasive melanoma cases, invasion depth correlated significantly with prognosis in univariate and multivariate analyses. High-intensity nestin staining was observed in 14 of the 33 cases and a high proportion of nestin-positive cells was observed in 16 cases. In stage III oral melanoma cases, nestin expression was not significantly associated with disease progression. However, in stage IV cases, both the intensity and the proportion of nestin expression were significantly associated with disease progression (P=0.022 and 0.005, respectively).

Immunoreactivity for CYP27B1 was significantly lower in the vertical growth phase and metastatic melanomas (0.6 and 0.5 arbitrary units, respectively) in comparison with nevi and radial growth phase tumors (1.2 and 1.1 arbitrary units, respectively); and expression was reduced in more advanced lesions (Clark levels III-V, Breslow thickness ≥2.1 mm; 0.8 and 0.7 arbitrary units, respectively). There was an inverse correlation between CYP27B1 and Ki-67 expression. Furthermore, CYP27B1 expression was reduced in primary melanomas that created metastases in comparison with non-metastasizing melanomas. Reduced CYP27B1 expression in radial growth phase was related to shorter overall survival (810 versus 982 versus 1151 days in melanomas with absent, low, and high CYP27B1 immunoreactivity), and low CYP27B1 expression in radial growth phase and vertical growth phase was related to shorter disease-free survival (114 versus 339 versus 737 days and 129 versus 307 versus 737 days, respectively, in melanomas with absent, low, and high CYP27B1). Also, CYP27B1 expression was inversely related to melanin in melanoma cells in vivo and melanoma cells cultured in vitro.

A durable impact on both relapse-free and overall survival was seen only with the regimen utilizing high-dose IFN-α2b tested in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and intergroup trials E1684, E1690, and E1694 as adjuvant therapy for high-risk surgically resected melanoma (stage IIB or III). Adjuvant pegylated IFN-α2b has also been evaluated at maximally tolerable doses compared with the observation group in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer trial 18991 and has shown relapse-free survival benefits in patients with microscopic nodal disease.",

Thirty-one patients (22 men, nine women) with high-risk malignant melanoma received eight 6-week cycles of rIL-2 and rIFN-alpha. Serum samples of all patients were screened for the presence of antibodies against IFN-alpha by a solid enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Specimens testing positive in the EIA were assessed for their ability to neutralize the antiviral effects of IFN-alpha in vitro in an antibody-neutralizing bioassay (ANB). Furthermore, serum levels of neopterin, beta 2-microglobulin, soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), anticardiolipin and antithyroglobulin were evaluated. Of 31 patients, 11 (36%) developed binding antibodies; three (27%) of them had antibodies with neutralizing capacities (range, 350-28,000 INU/ml). Of male patients, 8 (36%) of 22 versus 1 (11%) of nine female patients developed antibodies. Statistical analysis (unpaired t test) revealed that all patients with antibody titers showed significant (p < 0.04) lower serum levels of beta 2-microglobulin and reproducible decreases in sIL-2R levels, whereby those with neutralizing antibodies showed significantly (p < 0.0001) lower values than did those with binding antibodies. Elevations of anticardiolipin (17 of 31) and antithyroglobulin (one of 31) were not correlated to the presence of IFN antibodies. Our results show the in vivo significance of antibodies against rIFN-alpha, especially of those with neutralizing capacities. Monitoring of antibody formation as well as immunoparameters like beta 2-microglobulin in clinical trials can contribute to identifying patients who, if necessary, might benefit from alternative IFN treatment, for instance, by using natural IFNs.",

Our aim was to correlate plasma TGF-β1 levels and systemic oxidative stress biomarkers in patients with melanoma, with or without disease metastasis, to understand their participation in melanoma progression. Thirty patients were recruited for melanoma surveillance, together with 30 healthy volunteers. Patients were divided into two groups: Non-metastasis, comprising patients with tumor removal and no metastatic episode for 3 years; and Metastasis, comprising patients with a metastatic episode. The plasmatic cytokines TGF-β1, IL-1 β, and TNF-α were analyzed by ELISA. For oxidative stress, the following assays were performed: malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) levels, total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP) and thiol in plasma, and lipid peroxidation, SOD and catalase activity and GSH in erythrocytes. Patients with a metastatic episode had less circulating TGF-β1 and increased TRAP, thiol, AOPP and lipid peroxidation levels. MDA was increased in both melanoma groups, while catalase, GSH, and IL-1β was decreased in Non-metastasis patients. Significant negative correlations were observed between TGF-β1 levels and systemic MDA, and TGF-β1 levels and systemic AOPP, while a positive correlation was observed between TGF-β1 levels and erythrocyte GSH. Lower levels of TGF-β1 were related to increased oxidative stress in Metastasis patients, reinforcing new evidence that in melanoma TGF-β1 acts as a tumor suppressor, inhibiting tumor relapse. These findings provide new knowledge concerning this cancer pathophysiology, extending the possibilities of investigating new therapies based on this evidence. ",

The levels of NK activity of the patients and their relatives were found to be significantly correlated, suggesting that the NK activity in these families may have been genetically (or environmentally) determined. Several genetic markers were examined in the patients and their relatives for association with the disease state and NK activity. No association with HLA antigens or ABO blood groups was detected, but there was a low incidence of the Rhesus negative phenotype in the patients (the Rh phenotype had previously been associated with high NK activity).

The transcription factors PAX3 and FOXD3 have essential roles in melanoblasts and melanoma. In this study, we define a regulatory pathway where FOXD3 promotes the expression of PAX3. Both factors are expressed in melanoma cells and there is a positive correlation between the transcript levels of PAX3 and FOXD3. The PAX3 gene contains two FOX binding motifs within highly conserved enhancer regulatory elements that are essential for neural crest development. FOXD3 binds to both of these motifs in vitro but only one of these sites is preferentially utilized in melanoma cells. Overexpression of FOXD3 upregulates PAX3 levels while inhibition of FOXD3 function does not alter PAX3 protein levels, supporting that FOXD3 is sufficient but not necessary to drive PAX3 expression in melanoma cells. Here, we identify a molecular pathway where FOXD3 upregulates PAX3 expression and therefore contributes to melanoma progression.",

Therefore, reliably detection methods and meaningful tumor markers are required. Expression of the human endogenous retrovirus (HERV)-K(HML-2) was found elevated in melanomas and it was shown that HERV-K supports the in vitro transition of melanoma cells from adherent to a more malignant, nonadherent phenotype. Furthermore, the detection of HERV-K-specific antibodies in melanoma patients was found to correlate with reduced survival. However, the reason for HERV-K expression in melanomas still remains unclear and its use as a tumor marker needs further investigation. Therefore, the tumor-specific transcriptional regulation of HERV-K expression in melanoma was studied in detail. Human melanoma cell lines were investigated for HERV-K expression using real-time PCR. Five cell lines showed very high levels of HERV-K mRNA as a result of increased promoter activity. This promoter activity was directly silenced by DNA methylation in reporter gene experiments. Higher levels of long terminal repeat (LTR) methylation in cells not expressing HERV-K compared with cells expressing HERV-K were found using methylation-sensitive PCR and bisulfite sequencing. Treatment of cell lines with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine resulted in increased levels of HERV-K expression in cells previously not expressing HERV-K and it was shown that this increase is not the result of transcription factor activation. These results demonstrate that increased HERV-K expression in melanomas may be due to increased promoter activity and demethylation of the 5'LTR.",

Its value in the immunohistochemical diagnosis of tumours of melanocytic origin is well established. More recently, a potential role has been proposed for the serum concentration of this protein as a marker of metastatic melanoma disease activity. In the present study, the concentration of serum S-100 protein was measured in 97 patients with histologically proven malignant melanoma who were attending a dermatology and/or oncology department for the follow-up of their disease. Serum S-100 was also measured in 48 control subjects without malignant melanoma. The clinical stage of the patients was classified according to the criteria of the American Joint Committee on Cancer into stages I-IV. The median (range) serum S-100 protein concentration was significantly higher in stage I (0.11 (0.1-0.21) microgram/L, P < 0.001), stage II (0.11 (0.05-0.22) microgram/L, P < 0.001), stage III (0.24 (0.07-0.41) microgram/L, P < 0.0001) and stage IV (0.39 (0.06-15.0) microgram/L, P < 0.0001) compared with the control group (0.1 (0.05-0.15) microgram/L). At a threshold value of 0.2 microgram/L, the sensitivity and specificity for detection of advanced disease were 82% and 91%, respectively. Thus serum S-100 protein may be a valuable prognostic marker for malignant melanoma and for monitoring therapy. Serum S-100 protein concentration was also compared with the Breslow thickness of the tumours. There was a significant correlation between these variables (n = 72, rs = 0.32, P < 0.01). Combining a serum S-100 threshold value of > 0.22 microgram/L and a Breslow thickness of > 4 mm improved the sensitivity and specificity for the presence of secondary spread to 91% and 95%, respectively. Therefore, a combination of both baseline serum S-100 protein and Breslow thickness may provide a better indication of the prognosis at diagnosis.",

Inhibition of melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein mRNA and protein expression were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. Cell viability and apoptosis were quantitated by colorimetric viability assays and by annexin V staining, respectively. Oligonucleotide M706 was identified as the most efficient antisense sequence which downregulated melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein mRNA and protein levels in G361 cells by 68 and 78%, respectively. The specificity of target downregulation was confirmed using scrambled sequence control oligonucleotides that only marginally decreased melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein expression. Whereas downregulation of melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein moderately inhibited cell growth by 26%, in combination with cisplatin, this resulted in a supra-additive effect with almost 57% reduction in G361 cell viability compared with cisplatin alone (17%) (P<0.05). Cell death was mainly due to apoptosis as demonstrated by a 3- to 4-fold increase in annexin V-positive cells and typical morphological changes compared with controls.

Of these patients, 75 with a history of stage I (localized) melanoma and three patients with stage II (history of controlled regionally metastatic melanoma) underwent removal of multiple skin lesions on a prophylactic basis. Of the removed lesions, 28% showed hyperplasia, atypia, dysplasia, or melanoma. Nine unsuspected in situ, or level I melanomas, and three unsuspected invasive melanomas were removed from these 75 melanoma patients while excising lesions prophylactically during the 4-year interval. It is estimated that four to six additional melanomas were prevented by excision of precursor lesions. During the same 4-year interval, an additional 112 of approximately 1000 patients without a previous history of melanoma underwent prophylactic lesion removals. In 31% of the 112 patients, there was a history of melanoma in a first-degree relative. In 22% of the removed lesions there was hyperplasia, atypia, or dysplasia. Three cases of melanoma in situ were detected and it is estimated that an additional three to five cases of melanoma were prevented. Atypical findings occurred in 71, or 63%, of the patients biopsied, which represented 7% of the approximately 1000 patients screened. During the 4-year interval, an average of 17.7 lesions were removed from each of the 190 melanoma and nonmelanoma patients undergoing prophylactic skin lesion excision. This was accomplished in one to four sessions per patient. This average reflects only those patients who underwent one excision or more and does not include those patients treated without operation. When including the nonoperated patients screened during this interval, the average number of lesions removed was 2.7 per patient. Death from new melanomas was prevented during the 14-year period of this study as evidenced by the fact that no patient died or developed metastatic disease from a cutaneous melanoma that was not apparent or known about at the time of first examination.",

The low pH treatment resulted in an increase in antibody titer in eight of ten serum samples. The antibody activity in membrane immunofluorescence was quantitatively inhibited by the filtered antigen fraction and purified FA, suggesting the presence of anti-FA antibodies in the treated serum, which possibly were complexed with FA in the untreated sample. As determined by competitive inhibition in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the filtrate (antigen fraction) contained an antigen that was immunologically similar to FA.

Coimmunoprecipitation experiments assessed the association of Pgp with the adhesion molecule CD44 in multidrug resistant (MDR) melanoma cells, compared with parental ones. In MDR cells, the two proteins colocalized in the plasma membrane as visualized by confocal microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy on ultrathin cryosections. MDR melanoma cells displayed a more invasive phenotype compared with parental cells, as demonstrated by quantitative transwell chamber invasion assay. This was accomplished by a different migration strategy adopted by resistant cells (\"chain collective\") previously described in tumor cells with high metastatic capacity. The Pgp molecule, after stimulation with specific antibodies, appeared to cooperate with CD44, through the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) proteins. This activation led to an increase of metalloproteinase (MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9) mRNAs, and proteolytic activities, which are associated with an increased invasive behavior.

In a case-control study, melanoma cases (n = 202) and controls (n = 202) matched for age and gender filled in a questionnaire about melanoma risk factors. After filling in the questionnaire, all participants were interviewed and examined by a dermatologist in order to compare self-assessment with physician-assessment. The number of naevi, skin phototype and ultraviolet damage to the skin were identified as independent risk factors for melanoma on both self-assessment and physician-assessment. Receiver operating characteristics analysis showed no statistically significant difference between the accuracy of the self-assessment-based model and the model based on physician-assessment. While excluding 90% of the controls, the self-assessment-based high-risk group included 39% (95% confidence interval 31-48%) of the melanoma patients and the physician-assessment-based high-risk group included 42% (95% confidence interval 33-52%) of the melanoma patients.

Melanomas arise during melanoblast differentiation into melanocytes and from young proliferating melanocytes through somatic mutagenesis and epigenetic regulations. In the present study, we used several human melanoma cell lines from the sequential phases of melanoma development (radial growth phase, vertical growth phase and metastatic phase) to compare: (i) the frequency and efficiency of the induction of cell death via apoptosis and necroptosis; (ii) the presence of neural and cancer stem cell biomarkers as well as death receptors, DR5 and FAS, in both adherent and spheroid cultures of melanoma cells; (iii) anti-apoptotic effects of the endogenous production of cytokines and (iv) the ability of melanoma cells to perform neural trans-differentiation. We demonstrated that programed necrosis or necroptosis, could be induced in two metastatic melanoma lines, FEMX and OM431, while the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis was prevalent in a vast majority of melanoma lines. All melanoma lines used in the current study expressed substantial levels of pluripotency markers, SOX2 and NANOG. There was a trend for increasing expression of Nestin, an early neuroprogenitor marker, during melanoma progression. Most of the melanoma lines, including WM35, FEMX and A375, can grow as a spheroid culture in serum-free media with supplements. It was possible to induce neural trans-differentiation of 1205Lu and OM431 melanoma cells in serum-free media supplemented with insulin. This was confirmed by the expression of neuronal markers, doublecortin and β3-Tubulin, by significant growth of neurites and by the negative regulation of this process by a dominant-negative Rac1N17. These results suggest a relative plasticity of differentiated melanoma cells and a possibility for their neural trans-differentiation without the necessity for preliminary dedifferentiation. ",

Nevertheless, in metastatic melanoma, the nature of cancer stem cells is under debate and their contribution to metastasis formation remains unknown. Using an experimental metastasis model, we discovered that high levels of the WNT receptor, FZD7, correlated with enhanced metastatic potentials of melanoma cell lines. Knocking down of FZD7 in a panel of four melanoma cell lines led to a significant reduction in lung metastases in animal models, arguing that FZD7 plays a causal role during metastasis formation. Notably, limiting dilution analyses revealed that FZD7 is essential for the tumor initiation of melanoma cells and FZD7 knockdown impeded the early expansion of metastatic melanoma cells shortly after seeding, in accordance with the view that tumor initiating ability of cancer cells is required for metastasis formation. FZD7 activated JNK in melanoma cell lines in vitro and the expression of a dominant negative JNK suppressed metastasis formation in vivo, suggesting that FZD7 may promote metastatic growth of melanoma cells via activation of JNK. Taken together, our findings uncovered a signaling pathway that regulates the tumor initiation of melanoma cells and contributes to metastasis formation in melanoma. ",

However, it is not known which factors contribute to the immunologic host reaction against malignant melanoma. Because epidermal cells and, in particular, normal as well as transformed keratinocytes recently have been demonstrated to release various immunomodulating cytokines, the capacity of melanoma cells to produce interleukin-1 (IL-1) was examined. Accordingly, supernatants derived from different melanoma cell lines contained significant levels of IL-1 activity. Upon high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) gel filtration, melanoma cell-derived IL-1 (MEL-IL-1) exhibited molecular weight heterogeneity, and HPLC chromatofocusing revealed major activity at pH 5.0 and minor activity at pH 7.0. A monoclonal antibody directed against monocyte-derived IL-1 blocked MEL-IL-1 activity significantly and was able to precipitate four species of biosynthetically radiolabeled MEL-IL-1 (25, 17, 6, and 4 kilodaltons), suggesting that MEL-IL-1 is identical to monocyte-derived IL-1. This was also confirmed by Northern blot analysis detecting IL-1 alpha specific mRNA in melanoma cells by hybridization with a cDNA fragment encoding for IL-1 alpha. Thus, melanoma cells, like other epidermal cells, exhibit the capacity to release the immunomodulating cytokine IL-1 and, therefore, probably have the potency to influence host defense mechanisms directed against malignant melanoma.",

Although dasatinib targets SRC kinase, neither expression nor phosphorylation of SRC appears to predict response to dasatinib. Identification of predictive biomarkers for dasatinib may facilitate selection of melanoma patients who are more likely to respond to dasatinib. We correlated the anti-proliferative effects of dasatinib in 8 melanoma cell lines with expression of a previously identified 6-gene biomarker panel. We examined the relationship between response to dasatinib and expression of each gene at both the mRNA and protein level. Dasatinib inhibited growth in 3 of the 8 cell lines tested. mRNA expression of the panel of 6 biomarkers did not correlate with response, whilst elevated protein expression of ANXA1, CAV-1 and EphA2 correlated significantly with response to dasatinib in the panel of cell lines. Expression of ANXA1, CAV-1 and EphA2 were analysed in 124 melanoma samples by immunohistochemistry. ANXA1 protein was detected in 81 % (97/120) of tumours, CAV-1 in 44 % (54/122) of tumours and EphA2 in 74 % (90/121) of tumours. Thirty one % (35/113) of tumours tested expressed all three markers and 19 % (21/112) had moderate or strong expression of ANXA1, CAV-1 and EphA2.

However, the low titer and incidence of autologous antibody to melanoma have hampered further evaluation. By utilizing acid dissociation and ultrafiltration of serum, we have been able to augment the detectable autologous immune response to melanoma in the majority of patients studied. In autologous system Y-Mel 84:420, serum S150 demonstrated a rise in titer from 1:32 in native sera to 1:262,044 after dissociation. The antigen detected by S150 was found to be broadly represented on melanoma, glioma, renal cell carcinoma, neuroblastoma, and head and neck carcinoma cell lines. It did not react with bladder or colon carcinoma, fetal fibroblasts, pooled platelets, lymphocytes and red blood cells, or autologous cultured lymphocytes. Using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, S150 detects a 66,000-mol wt antigen in spent tissue culture media and serum ultrafiltrate. In cell lysate two bands between 20,000 and 30,000 mol wt are detected by S150. The 66,000-mol wt antigen is sensitive to trypsin digestion and but is resistant to pepsin and heat inactivation. Exposure of spent media to trypsin results in the development of a 24,000-mol wt band that appears to correspond to the antigen detected in the cell lysate. The difference between the antigens detected in the cell lysate as compared with spent media and serum ultrafiltrate may be due to degradation during cell lysis.

The almost mutually exclusive proliferative and invasive phenotypes are defined by distinct gene expression signatures, which are themselves controlled by the level of functional MITF protein present in the cell. Recently, new signaling pathways and transcription factors that regulate MITF expression have been defined, and high throughput genomics have identified novel MITF target genes. MITF acts both as a transcription activator to promote expression of genes involved in cell cycle, but also as a transcriptional repressor of genes involved in invasion. A novel human germline mutation in MITF has been identified that blocks its sumoylation, thereby altering its transcriptional properties and conferring an increased risk of melanoma.

Ten patients (66.6%) died of their disease, one is alive with disease, and four are alive without evidence of disease. For the living patients the duration of follow-up was 20 to 118 months (mean 63.6 months). Of those who died, survival ranged from 3 to 76 months (mean 25.1 months).

The main risk factors for melanoma (i.e. exposure to sunlight, naevus count, phototype, and family history of melanoma) may not wholly explain the epidemiological trends observed for this cancer. The light-at-night theory postulates that increasing use of artificial light-at-night may contribute to the increasing breast cancer incidence through suppressed secretion of melatonin (a hormone produced in the dark and inhibited by light, which regulates circadian rhythms). Here, we postulate that this theory may also apply to melanoma and that it may explain a part of this cancer burden. Consistent with our hypothesis is evidence from experimental studies suggesting a lightening effect of melatonin on frog skin and mammal hair during seasonal changes, its antioxidant and anti-carcinogenic effects in skin melanocytes, as well as the expression of melatonin receptors in melanocytes. Also, epidemiological data suggest lower melatonin concentrations in melanoma patients compared with controls; a potential therapeutic effect of melatonin in patients with metastatic disease; a higher prevalence of melanoma in pilots and aircrews, with increased risks with higher time zones travelled; and increased melanoma risks in office workers exposed to fluorescent lighting. Moreover, melanoma incidence and seasonal patterns are consistent with a reduction of melatonin secretion with intensity of exposure to light, although it remains difficult to distinguish the effect of melatonin disruption from that of sun exposure on the basis of ecological studies. Finally, the reported associations between hormonal factors and melanoma are consistent with melatonin inhibition increasing the risk of melanoma by increasing circulating oestrogen levels. Despite the existing suggestive evidence, the light-at-night hypothesis has never been directly tested for melanoma. Very few studies examined the potential associations between melanoma risk and shift work or melatonin concentrations, and we found no studies reporting on the relationship between melanoma and number of sleeping hours, use of melatonin supplements, blindness, night-time city light levels, bedroom light levels, or clock genes polymorphisms. Therefore, since several observations support our hypothesis and very little research has been undertaken on this subject, we strongly encourage analytic epidemiological studies to test the light-at-night theory for melanoma causation.",

The serine/threonine kinase B-RAF is mutated in 50% to 70% of melanomas and protects melanoma cells from anoikis, a form of apoptosis induced by lack of adhesion or adhesion to an inappropriate matrix. Mutant B-RAF down-regulates two BH3-only proapoptotic proteins, Bim(EL) and Bad. BH3-only proteins act, at least in part, by sequestering prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins and preventing them from inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Several Bcl-2 proteins are up-regulated in melanoma; however, the mechanisms of up-regulation and their role in melanoma resistance to anoikis remain unclear. Using RNA interference, we show that depletion of Mcl-1 renders mutant B-RAF melanoma cells sensitive to anoikis. By contrast, minor effects were observed following depletion of either Bcl-2 or Bcl-(XL). Mcl-1 expression is enhanced in melanoma cell lines compared with melanocytes and up-regulated by the B-RAF-MEK-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway through control of Mcl-1 protein turnover. Similar to B-RAF knockdown cells, adhesion to fibronectin protected Mcl-1 knockdown cells from apoptosis. Finally, expression of Bad, which does not sequester Mcl-1, further augmented apoptosis in nonadherent Mcl-1 knockdown cells. Together, these data support the notion that BH3 mimetic compounds that target Mcl-1 may be effective for the treatment of melanoma in combinatorial strategies with agents that disrupt fibronectin-integrin signaling.",

Furthermore, the reduced nuclear ING3 expression was significantly correlated with a poorer disease-specific 5-year survival of patients with primary melanoma, especially for the high-risk melanomas (thickness >or=2.0 mm) with the survival rate reducing from 93% for patients with strong nuclear ING3 staining in their tumor biopsies to 44% for those with negative-to-moderate nuclear ING3 staining (P=0.004).

The oncofetal antigen GPC3 is a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored membrane protein and may be secreted. It is a novel tumor marker for human HCC: GPC3 protein was present in sera from 40-50% of HCC patients, but was not detected in sera from patients with liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis, or in sera from healthy individuals. alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) and PIVKA-II (protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II), are well known major tumor markers for HCC. Generally, AFP shows high positivity for HCC but also high false-positivity in detection assays. Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) is a recently described marker of HCC. Detection of AFP-L3 shows a much higher specificity than AFP, but a lower sensitivity. On the other hand, detection of PIVKA-II shows a lower false-positivity, but is not always sensitive enough to detect low levels secreted by small HCCs. There was no correlation between the three tumor markers, AFP, PIVKA-II, and GPC3 in terms of their presence in HCC cells. All three tumor markers showed similar positivity in patients with HCC, detecting 80% of patients with the disease. GPC3 is also a novel tumor marker for the diagnosis of human melanoma, especially in the early stages of the disease. Expression of GPC3 mRNA and protein was evident in tumor cells from >80% of patients with melanoma and melanocytic nevus, which is a common benign lesion. GPC3 protein was detected in sera from 40% (36/91) of melanoma patients, but not in sera from those with large congenital melanocytic nevus, or from healthy donors. Surprisingly, we detected serum GPC3 even in patients with stage 0, in situ melanoma. The positive detection rate of serum GPC3 at stage 0, I, and II (44.4%, 40.0%, 47.6%, respectively) was significantly higher than that of 5-S-cysteinyldopa, a well known tumor marker for melanoma (0.0%, 8.0%, and 10.0%, respectively). Interestingly, GPC3 was highly immunogenic in mice and elicited effective anti-tumor immunity with no evidence of autoimmunity. Thus, GPC3 is useful for diagnosis of HCC and melanoma and may also have a role in immunotherapy or tumor prevention. However, studies in humans are warranted.",

Up-regulated expression of sodium pump alpha sub-units has previously been demonstrated when comparing metastatic to non-metastatic melanomas. Our previous data revealed that impairing sodium pump alpha1 activity by means of selective ligands, that are cardiotonic steroids, markedly impairs cell migration and kills apoptosis-resistant cancer cells. The objective of this study was to determine the expression levels of sodium pump alpha sub-units in melanoma clinical samples and cell lines and also to characterize the role of alpha1 sub-units in melanoma cell biology. Quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to determine the expression levels of sodium pump alpha sub-units. In vitro cytotoxicity of various cardenolides and of an anti-alpha1 siRNA was evaluated by means of MTT assay, quantitative videomicroscopy and through apoptosis assays. The in vivo activity of a novel cardenolide UNBS1450 was evaluated in a melanoma brain metastasis model. Our data show that all investigated human melanoma cell lines expressed high levels of the alpha1 sub-unit, and 33% of human melanomas displayed significant alpha1 sub-unit expression in correlation with the Breslow index. Furthermore, cardenolides (notably UNBS1450; currently in Phase I clinical trials) displayed marked anti-tumour effects against melanomas in vitro. This activity was closely paralleled by decreases in cMyc expression and by increases in apoptotic features.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA), an unsupervised multivariate data analysis method, is used to detect possible outliers, while Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structure (OPLS), a supervised multivariate data analysis method, is employed to evaluate important metabolites responsible for discriminating the control and the melanoma groups. Both PCA and OPLS results reveal that the melanoma group can be well separated from its control group.

Interestingly, the three lines with high levels of baseline pathway activity (OCM1, OCM3, and OCM8) had their growth reduced by pharmacologic Notch blockade using the γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) MRK003. In contrast, two uveal melanoma lines (Mel285 and Mel290) with very low expression of Notch targets were insensitive to the GSI. Constitutively active forms of Notch1 and Notch2 promoted growth of uveal melanoma cultures and were able to rescue the inhibitory effects of GSI. MRK003 treatment also inhibited anchorage-independent clonogenic growth and cell invasion and reduced phosphorylation levels of STAT3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2. Suppression of canonical Notch activity using short hairpin RNA targeting Notch2 or CBF1 was also able to reduce tumor growth and invasion.

In a parallel fashion, the field of melanoma is shifting with the utilization of targeted therapy to treat BRAF-mutated melanoma. We reviewed published literature in PubMed on GIST and melanoma, with a focus on both past and current clinical trials. The data presented centers on imatinib, vemurafenib, and most recently dabrafenib, targeting KIT and BRAF mutations and their outcomes in GIST and melanoma. The BRAF(V600E) melanoma mutation, like the KIT exon 11 mutation in GIST, has the highest response to therapy. High response rates with inhibition of KIT in GIST have not been recapitulated in KIT-mutated melanoma. Median time to resistance to targeted agents occurs in ~7 months with BRAF inhibitors and 2 years for imatinib in GIST. In GIST, the development of secondary mutations leads to resistance; however, there have been no similar gatekeeper mutations found in melanoma. Although surgery remains an important component of the treatment of early GIST and melanoma, surgeons will need to continue to define the thresholds and timing for operation in the setting of metastatic disease with improved targeted therapies.

In WT/WT melanoma cells displaying high levels of phospho-ErbB3, knockdown of NRG1 reduced cell viability and was associated with decreased phosphorylation of ErbB3, its coreceptor ErbB2, and its downstream target, AKT. Similar effects were observed by targeting ErbB3 with either siRNAs or the neutralizing ErbB3 monoclonal antibodies huHER3-8 and NG33. In addition, pertuzumab-mediated inhibition of ErbB2 heterodimerization decreased AKT phosphorylation, cell growth in vitro, and xenograft growth in vivo. Pertuzumab also potentiated the effects of MEK inhibitor on WT/WT melanoma growth in vitro and in vivo. These findings demonstrate that targeting ErbB3-ErbB2 signaling in a cohort of WT/WT melanomas leads to tumor growth reduction.

Although the first English-language report of melanoma in 1820 contained a description of a melanoma-prone family, seminal studies by investigators at the National Cancer Institute and the University of Pennsylvania identified dysplastic nevi (DN) as an important melanoma precursor, suggested an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance for both melanoma and DN, and proposed that a melanoma-susceptibility gene (CMM1) was located on chromosome 1p36. This gene assignment has not yet been confirmed by independent investigators. A second melanoma gene, designated CMM2, has been mapped to chromosome 9p21. This gene assignment has been confirmed independently, and the cell cycle regulator p16INK4a has been proposed as a candidate gene; germline mutations in this gene have been identified in about half of melanoma-prone families. Germline mutations in the cyclin-dependent kinase gene CDK4 (chromosome 12q14) have recently been described in two melanoma kindreds; this finding likely represents a third melanoma gene. A heritable determinant for total nevus number has been suggested, as has the presence of a major gene responsible for total nevus density in melanoma-prone families. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance for DN has been proposed, and evidence suggests that DN may be a pleiotropic manifestation of the 1p36 familial melanoma gene. Several studies have shown a surprisingly high prevalence of DN on the skin of family members of probands with DN. In light of the extensive evidence documenting that persons with DN (both sporadic and familial) have an increased prospective risk for melanoma, these family studies suggest that relatives of persons with DN should be examined for DN and for melanoma. Overall, genetic determinants have a major role in the pathogenesis of normal nevi, DN, and melanoma. Elucidating the molecular basis of these genetic events promises to enhance melanoma risk reduction strategies and thereby reduce melanoma-associated mortality.",

Tumor-specific mutations or epigenetic modifications have predominantly been detected in tissue specimens. The purpose of this study was to investigate methylation of five different genes involved in tumor suppression and DNA repair (suppressors of cytokine signaling 1 and 2 (SOCS1, SOCS2)), Ras-association domain family protein 1A (RASSF1a), D-type p16(INK4a) cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKN), and O6-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT)) in the serum of 100 patients using methylation-specific PCR. In all, 41 melanoma patients (stage I = 18; stage II = 10; stage III/IV = 13), 13 healthy controls without nevi, and 10 individuals with more than 15 nevi of >5 mm in size were investigated. For comparison, sera from patients with other skin tumors (nine basal cell cancers, five Kaposi's sarcoma), different metastasized cancers (five breast cancers, five colon cancers), and several chronic inflammatory diseases (n = 12) were also analyzed. In addition, we examined if methylation was involved in silencing transcription of these genes in 12 melanoma specimens. SOCS1, SOCS2, RASSF1a, CDKN2a, and MGMT were methylated in 75, 43, 64, 75, and 64% of melanoma samples, respectively. Of the 41 melanoma patients, 83% had one hypermethylated gene, while 66, 51, and 41% had two, three, or four hypermethylated genes, respectively. Also, 20% of these patients showed hypermethylation for all genes, while only 17% showed no methylation. Importantly, the methylation profile of the selected genes from melanoma patients was distinct from the other analyzed tumors. Transcription of SOCS1, SOCS2, CDKN2a, and RASSF1a genes was significantly reduced in fresh melanoma samples, while MGMT showed a 12-fold upregulation at the messenger ribonucleic acid level (P < 0.001). Our findings suggest that epigenetic silencing of the studied tumor suppressor genes is a common and probably important mechanism for melanoma formation. This convenient method using a simple blood sample may contribute to classification of melanoma and awaits clinical validation.",

The purpose of this study was to determine if BRAF mutations occur in canine oral malignant melanomas. The canine BRAF gene was first cloned from normal canine testicular cDNA, and a novel previously unreported splice variant involving exon 5 was identified during this process. To screen canine melanoma samples for BRAF mutation in codon 599, cDNA and genomic DNA were isolated from canine malignant melanoma cell lines and primary tumor samples respectively, all from cases seen at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at the University of California, Davis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for exon 15 using primers based at the 5' end of exon 15 and the 5' end of intron 15 and the resultant products were directly sequenced. No mutations in codon 599 or exon 15 were identified in any of the 17 samples evaluated. However, all of the melanoma cell lines expressed BRAF and demonstrated high levels of basal ERK phosphorylation suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway is present. Therefore, similar to the case with human mucosal melanomas, canine oral malignant melanomas do not possess codon 599 BRAF mutations commonly identified in human cutaneous melanomas. This finding supports the notion that melanomas arising from non-sun-exposed sites exhibit distinct mechanisms of molecular transformation.",

Antigen-loss variants can often result, as these antigens are not critical for tumor cell survival. Exploration of functionally relevant targets has been limited. The melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein (ML-IAP; livin) is overexpressed in melanoma, contributing to disease progression and treatment resistance. Improved understanding of the significance of ML-IAP immune responses in patients has possible therapeutic applications. We found ML-IAP frequently expressed in melanoma metastases by immunohistochemistry. To assess spontaneous immunity to ML-IAP, an overlapping peptide library representing full-length protein was utilized to screen cellular responses in stage I-IV patients and healthy controls by ELISPOT. A broad array of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cellular responses against ML-IAP was observed with novel class I and class II epitopes identified. Specific HLA-A*0201 epitopes were analyzed further for frequency of reactivity. The generation of specific CD4(+) and cytotoxic T cells revealed potent functional capability including cytokine responsiveness to melanoma cell lines and tumor cell killing. In addition, recombinant ML-IAP protein used in an ELISA demonstrated high titer antibody responses in a subset of patients. Several melanoma patients who received CTLA-4 blockade with ipilimumab developed augmented humoral immune responses to ML-IAP as a function of treatment which was associated with beneficial clinical outcomes. High frequency immune responses in melanoma patients, associations with favorable treatment outcomes, and its essential role in melanoma pathogenesis support the development of ML-IAP as a disease marker and therapeutic target.",

Lifetime job histories, sun exposure and other host factors were obtained from personal interviews with each individual. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between melanoma risk and occupational activity levels, measured as total metabolic equivalent hours, with adjustment for occupational sun exposure, recreational sun exposure and host factors. Risk estimates were elevated above one for each occupational activity quintile compared with those with sedentary jobs. However, the pattern of risk ratios was irregular and statistical significance was reached only by the highest quintile (odds ratio: 1.59, 95% confidence interval: 1.02-2.47) and the second lowest quintile (odds ratio: 1.62, 95% confidence interval: 1.10-2.39).

This is based on several observations.1.Spontaneous remissions occur occasionally.2.In about 5% of melanomas no primary tumour is found. The genetic aberrations of these tumours closely resemble those of cutaneous melanomas, and therefore are suggestive of spontaneous regressions of the primary tumours.3.Both primary tumours and metastases often have brisk lymphocytic infiltrates, a phenomenon that is correlated with better outcome.4.Studies of isolates of these tumour-infiltrating T lymphocytes have revealed that a proportion of these cells recognise melanoma antigens.5.Melanomas respond to immunotherapy. These observations have led to over 30 years of research on immunotherapy for melanoma; many of these efforts have failed, with only a few exceptions: interleukin-2 (IL-2) and to a lesser degree interferon-a (IFN-〈). Recently, new developments in immunotherapy have revolutionised this treatment modality. Anti-CTLA4 has received approval from the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of stage IV melanomas based on the improvement in overall survival in phase III trials, and more recently blockade of PD1/PDL1 interactions has shown objective clinical responses in a stage IV melanoma in early-phase clinical trials. In addition, several independent single-institution phase I/II trials using adoptive cell therapy have shown a consistently high response rate, including durable complete remissions in a substantial percentage of treated patients. Now, for the first time, immunotherapy has moved beyond the treatment of melanoma as both CTLA4 and PD1 blockade have been shown to induce objective responses in other tumour types as well. This chapter will discuss the mechanism of action, clinical efficacy and side effects of IL-2, the novel treatments consisting of the immune checkpoint blockade drugs anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 and adoptive cell therapy.

There is no satisfactory treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma that have an estimated 5-year survival of 6%. The potential of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) for the treatment of metastatic melanoma was recognized very early by RIT pioneers when murine melanoma was successfully treated by DeNardo, and later when Larson reported a shrinkage of tumor in a patient with metastatic melanoma treated with 131I-labeled Fab' fragments of a mAb against high-molecular-weight melanoma-associated antigen. Despite successes in the 1980s, RIT of melanoma did not develop into a clinical modality. The reasons for this are complex. In recent years, RIT has made an impression, as evidenced by the recent approval of Zevalin and Bexxar (anti-CD20 mAbs labeled with 90Y and 131I, respectively). Now there is a \"window of opportunity\" for RIT to become an effective therapy for metastatic melanoma. Surface antigen GD3 has been evaluated in patients as a potential target for melanoma RIT; pretargeting the administration of antibodies and intralesional administration of an antibody labeled with potent alpha-emitter 213-Bismuth have shown promise in clinical studies. Melanin, the pigment that gives melanoma its name, has emerged as a novel antigen for delivery of radioactivity to the tumors by antimelanin antibody. Simultaneously, radiolabeled metal-cyclized alpha-MSH peptide analogs and melanin-binding peptides are being developed as targeting molecules for melanoma. Overall, we are hopeful that targeted radionuclide therapy of metastatic melanoma will become a reality within the next few years.",

The importance of immunohistochemistry in diagnosis of the primary tumor and in early identification of metastases in lymphatic nodes is enormous; however melanoma phenotype is frequently variable and thus several markers must be employed simultaneously. The purposes of this study are to describe changes of phenotype of malignant melanoma in vitro and in vivo and to investigate whether changes of environmental factors mimicking natural conditions affect the phenotype of melanoma cells and can revert the typical in vitro loss of diagnostic markers. The influence of microenvironment was studied by means of immunocytochemistry on co-cultures of melanoma cells with melanoma-associated fibroblast and/or in conditioned media. The markers typical for melanoma (HMB45, Melan-A, Tyrosinase) were lost in malignant cells isolated from malignant effusion; however, tumor metastases shared identical phenotype with primary tumor (all markers positive). The melanoma cell lines also exerted reduced phenotype in vitro. The only constantly present diagnostic marker observed in our experiment was S100 protein and, in lesser extent, also Nestin. The phenotype loss was reverted under the influence of melanoma-associated fibroblast and/or both types of conditioned media. Loss of some markers of melanoma cell phenotype is not only of diagnostic significance, but it can presumably also contribute to biological behavior of melanoma. The presented study shows how the conditions of cultivation of melanoma cells can influence their phenotype.

The cause of the hypercalcemia was thought to be secondary to parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) as plasma levels were found to be elevated. The patient underwent two tumor biopsies: at diagnosis (when calcium levels were normal) and upon development of hypercalcemia and cachexia. PTHrP expression was higher in melanoma cells when hypercalcemia had occurred than prior to its onset. Metabolic characterization of melanoma cells revealed that, with development of hypercalcemia, there was high expression of monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), which is the main importer of lactate and ketone bodies into cells. MCT1 is associated with high mitochondrial metabolism. Beta-galactosidase (β-GAL), a marker of senescence, had reduced expression in melanoma cells upon development of hypercalcemia compared to pre-hypercalcemia. In conclusion, PTHrP expression in melanoma is associated with cachexia, increased cancer cell lactate and ketone body import, high mitochondrial metabolism, and reduced senescence. Further studies are required to determine if PTHrP regulates cachexia, lactate and ketone body import, mitochondrial metabolism, and senescence in cancer cells. ",

Large, multi-institutional studies have confirmed that in experienced hands it is an accurate, reliable technique to identify tumor in the draining lymph nodes. The complications of the procedure are low, and it is generally well tolerated. The presence of melanoma in the sentinel lymph node is the most important predictive factor in patients with intermediate thickness melanomas. In patients with thin melanomas (<1 mm), the incidence of a positive SLN is low. The choice to perform a SLN biopsy in these patients must be weighed with risk factors such as Clark level, ulceration, sex and mitotic rate. In patients with thick melanomas (>4 mm), most studies have supported the prognostic value of SLN status. Patients with desmoplastic melanomas have a high risk of local recurrence, but low risk of SLN metastasis if the pathology demonstrates a pure desmoplastic form. Younger patients have a higher incidence of positive lymph nodes, yet an overall more favorable prognosis compared to older patients.

However, the impact of TIGIT on melanoma specific CTLs in the effector phase remains still unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that melanoma cells control anti-melanoma CTL responses via the TIGIT-CD155 interaction in the effector phase. TIGIT is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells, and CD155 is one of the cognate ligands expressed on the tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells. First, we confirmed that CD155 was constitutively expressed on melanoma cells. We then demonstrated that CD155 on melanoma cells suppressed cytokine release from melanoma-specific CTLs via interaction with TIGIT. Overexpression of CD155 enhanced, and its downregulation attenuated the suppressive effect. This suggested that anti-melanoma CTL responses are controlled not only by an imbalance in CD226 (an activating molecule binds to CD155) and TIGIT expression on T cells but also by the expression levels of CD155 on melanoma cells. In addition, co-blockade of TIGIT and PD-1 signals synergistically elicited a response of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) on autologous melanoma cells. These results suggest that the CD155-TIGIT interaction should be blocked for enhancement of anti-melanoma immune responses.Journal of Investigative Dermatology accepted article preview online, 12 October 2015. doi:10.1038/jid.2015.404.",

Fifty-five percent of patients are still alive, and 45% had died-all but 3 patients from melanoma. Patients with stage IIC disease demonstrated a similar unfavorable course of disease as patients with stage IIIC disease (2-year relapse-free survival 18% and 26%). We identified two groups of patients with different cumulative interferon dose-levels (> or =90% and <90% of the projected dose, according to the protocol), who demonstrated at least transient differences, both in terms of relapse-free and overall survival; the predictive impact was statistically independent upon the Cox regression analysis.;Our clinical data are consistent with the published ECOG and Intergroup data dealing with highdose interferon in high-risk melanoma patients. The data suggest a dose-dependency on the treatment effect and, therefore, support further prospective trials comparing different dose-distribution patterns in high-dose interferon.",

The incidence of TIH in 751 patients with melanoma was 1.1%. All patients had liver and bone metastases at the time of hypercalcaemia. All patients had osteolytic lesions, most often multiple. The median survival was 30 days (range 4-136 days). After rehydration, the mean (+/- SEM) corrected calcium was 3.42 +/- 0.17 mmol/l. Parathyroid hormone levels were adequately suppressed and vitamin D concentrations were normal. Serum osteocalcin, a marker of bone formation, was low, except in the two patients with renal insufficiency, whereas fasting urinary calcium and hydroxyproline were increased, indicating inhibition of bone formation and stimulation of bone resorption. Increased parathyroid hormone-related protein secretion was noted in only one patient. Three of four patients became normocalcaemic after bisphosphonate therapy for a median duration of 2 weeks.

To evaluate whether serum IL-6 is a useful disease marker in metastatic malignant melanoma (MMM), we studied the time course of endogenous IL-6 secretion in 41 patients treated with cisplatinum, IL-2, and IFN-alpha. Furthermore, the relationship of endogenous IL-6 concentrations to the tumor burden and/or the clinical response was also evaluated. The baseline serum IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients with MMM than in the control group (P = 0.002). When tumor burden was taken into consideration, we found that IL-6 levels were higher in patients with high tumor burden than in patients with low tumor burden. During treatment in the whole patient population, a higher serum IL-6 level was observed in nonresponding as compared to responding patients at days 7 (P = 0.0005), 21 (P = 0.002), and 35 (P = 0.009). The follow-up of serum IL-6 in patients with MMM according to the tumor burden and clinical response demonstrated that: (a) IL-6 levels were significantly higher at days 7 and 21 in patients with high tumor burden as compared to those with low tumor burden; and (b) IL-6 levels remain significantly higher in nonresponding patients as compared to responding patients regardless of the tumor burden. From these results, we can conclude that endogenous IL-6 may play a role in the failure of IL-2 therapy in such patients, since the very early IL-6 increase is correlated with the tumor mass and nonresponse to biochemotherapy. Therefore, it seems that the early detection of endogenous IL-6 may represent valuable information for monitoring the response to biochemotherapy in patients with MMM.",

However, their heterogeneous expression in neoplastic lesions limits the eligibility of patients for cancer-testis antigen-directed vaccination, and low levels of cancer-testis antigens' expression may impair immune recognition of malignant cells. Because of the primary clinical relevance of cancer-testis antigens' expression in neoplastic tissues, 68 unrelated or sequential metastatic lesions from 56 patients were used to characterize the molecular mechanisms regulating the presence and levels of expression of different cancer-testis antigens of the MAGE family (i.e., MAGE2, 3 and 4) in cutaneous melanoma. Polymerase chain reaction-based methylation analyses showed that methylation status of specific cytosine-guanine dinucleotides in the promoters of investigated cancer-testis antigens correlated with their heterogeneous expression within unrelated metastatic melanoma lesions, and with their homogeneous expression among sequential metastases from three patients with melanoma. Unlike methylated promoters, unmethylated promoters of MAGE2, 3 and 4 genes drove the expression of reporter gene-enhanced green fluorescent protein after transient transfection of cancer-testis antigen-positive Mel 142 melanoma cells. Furthermore, de novo expression of MAGE3 gene induced by the treatment of Mel 195 melanoma cells with the DNA hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine was associated with a 6%-12% demethylation of selected cytosine-guanine dinucleotides in its promoter. Finally, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine induced a 16-fold increase of MAGE3 expression in Mel 313 melanoma cells expressing constitutively low levels of the antigen, but did not affect that of Mel 275 melanoma cells expressing high baseline levels of MAGE3. Overall, these findings identify promoter methylation as a shared mechanism directly regulating the expression of therapeutic cancer-testis antigens in metastatic melanomas, and foresee the clinical use of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine to design new chemoimmunotherapeutic strategies in patients with melanoma.",

Here, we show by reverse transcription and PCR expression of IL-8R beta, mRNA transcripts in different melanoma cell lines and in normal human melanocytes. To characterize the role of the IL-8R beta in melanoma cells, antiserum was raised in rabbits against a fusion protein containing the NH2-terminal portion of the receptor. Its specificity was shown by flow cytometry with IL-8R beta-transfected HL60 cells. A specific epitope could be mapped with IL-8R beta mutants to the peptide sequence between ASP-4 and ASP-14 of this receptor. Binding studies with [125I]GRO alpha in IL-8R beta transfectants indicated ligand antagonistic properties of this Ab. Expression of IL-8R beta protein at the cell surface of various melanoma cell lines could be shown by flow cytometry with F(ab')2 fragments of the IL-8R beta antiserum. Moreover, anti-IL-8R beta Ab partially blocked specific binding of [125I]GRO alpha in various melanoma cell lines. Addition of F(ab')2 fragments of the IL-8R beta antiserum or of neutralizing anti-GRO alpha mAb to different melanoma cell lines identified this GRO alpha-IL-8R beta interaction as a major component required for serum-independent melanoma cell growth.",

In this paper we used a large population-based cohort to replicate two published gene signatures for melanoma classification. We assessed the signatures prognostic value and explored their biological significance by correlating them with factors known to be associated with survival (vitamin D) or etiological routes (nevi, sun sensitivity and telomere length). Genomewide microarray gene expressions were profiled in 300 archived tumors (224 primaries, 76 secondaries). The two gene signatures classified up to 96% of our samples and showed strong correlation with melanoma specific survival (P=3 x 10(-4)), Breslow thickness (P=5 x 10(-10)), ulceration (P=9.x10-8) and mitotic rate (P=3 x 10(-7)), adding prognostic value over AJCC stage (adjusted hazard ratio 1.79, 95%CI 1.13-2.83), as previously reported. Furthermore, molecular subtypes were associated with season-adjusted serum vitamin D at diagnosis (P=0.04) and genetically predicted telomere length (P=0.03). Specifically, molecular high-grade tumors were more frequent in patients with lower vitamin D levels whereas high immune tumors came from patients with predicted shorter telomeres.

The direct correlation between serum MIA levels of patients with progressing melanomas and tumor load supports a role for MIA as a melanoma progression factor. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), activating ras mutation, or loss of p53 function on MIA expression and release from melanoma cells. We previously showed that transfection of a mutant constitutively active ras into the melanoma cell line, WM35, induces a phenotypic change from radial to vertical growth, exhibiting increased proliferation and migration. Here, we report that MIA release was elevated in a ras-transfected cell line. In addition, loss of functional p53, using a dominant negative construct, substantially lowered the level of MIA release compared to control. UVR stimulated release of MIA into the extracellular compartment in both the control and ras-transfected cell lines. In addition, MIA mRNA was increased following UVR in all cell lines tested. By inducing either apoptosis or necrosis, we were able to confirm that MIA protein is not released from cells due to cell death alone. We have identified a transcriptional effect of UVR on MIA expression and have shown that release of MIA protein is dependent upon functional p53. We propose that UVR-induced production and release of MIA may promote the detachment of radial and vertical growth phase melanomas from basement membrane or matrix proteins, serving as a unique progression mechanism for melanoma.",

The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of COX-2 as a melanoma prognostic marker and to establish an optimum algorithm for analysis of COX-2 expression levels in lesions of interest. Expression of COX-2 was detected immunohistochemically in standard sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 85 primary melanomas, 36 lymph node metastases, and five skin metastases including 39 cases of paired primary and metastatic lesions obtained from the same patient. Enhanced expression of COX-2 in primary melanomas is an indicator of poorer prognosis. A significant correlation was found between high expression of COX-2 in primary lesions and shorter survival. The enhancement of COX-2 expression is also positively correlated with other prognostic factors such as tumor thickness and infiltration level, ulceration, high mitotic index, more invasive histologic type, vertical growth phase, and lymph node metastasis. On the whole, the results suggest that intratumoral expression of COX-2 is a strong negative prognostic marker for patients with melanoma. Moreover, our work shows that a simple and objective immunohistochemical scoring algorithm involving the determination of only a percentage fraction of positively stained cells is sufficient to obtain the prognostic information.

We found moderate or strong hyperphosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 in 78/107 melanomas (73%). In contrast, only 3/67 benign nevi (4%) were moderately positive, and none were strongly positive. These data indicate that mTOR activation is very strongly associated with malignant, compared to benign, melanocytic lesions. Next, we tested six melanoma-derived cell lines for evidence of mTOR dysregulation. Five of the six lines showed persistent phosphorylation of S6 after 18 hours of serum deprivation, and four had S6 phosphorylation after 30 minutes of amino-acid withdrawal, indicating inappropriate mTOR activation. The proliferation of three melanoma-derived lines was blocked by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, indicating that mTOR activation is a growth-promoting factor in melanoma-derived cells. mTOR is directly activated by the small guanosine triphosphatase Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb), in a farnesylation-dependent manner. Therefore, to investigate the mechanism of mTOR activation, we used the farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-277, which partially blocked the growth of three of the six melanoma cell lines. Together, these data implicate activation of mTOR in the pathogenesis of melanoma, and suggest that Rheb and mTOR may be targets for melanoma therapy.",

Conjugates of chlorambucil with procainamide (1), diethylaminoethylamine (2) and 2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-ethylamine (3), as well as 4-(bis(2-chloroethyl)amino)- (6,7) and 4-(N,N-diethyltriazeno)-substituted (8-10) benzamides, were synthesized. Cell uptake studies with B16 melanoma cells revealed high uptake of radioiodinated 1 and 2, while radiolabelled chlorambucil was found to lack this characteristic. These results were confirmed by biodistribution studies in a mouse melanoma model. Viability measurements revealed that all chlorambucil-benzamide derivatives showed higher toxicity against B16 melanoma and SK-MEL-28 cells than did the parent chlorambucil itself, and that the triazene derivatives were more potent than dacarbazine, which is currently used as a standard cytostatic drug in melanoma therapy. Of all the compounds tested in this series, the triazenes 9 and 10 showed the most promising targeting effect. The toxicity of these compounds against hepatoma cells (MH3924A) and, to a lesser extent, against mouse fibroblast (NIH 3T3) and cervix carcinoma (HeLa) cells was also enhanced, but they were not as toxic as dacarbazine (HeLa). These findings support the concept of a selective, benzamide-mediated in vivo delivery of cytostatics in melanoma cells, leading to enhanced efficacy.",

Here, we report on the expression of CD44v in melanocytes, nevi, primary melanomas, and cutaneous and lymph node metastases. Thirteen nevi, 65 primary melanomas of varying thickness, 39 cutaneous and 15 lymph node metastases, and melanocytes and a panel of melanoma lines were tested for surface expression of the standard form of CD44 and the variant exons v5, v6, v7, v7-v8, and v10 by immunohistology or fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Melanocytes did not express any variant isoform of CD44. However, nevi, as well as primary melanoma and melanoma metastases, stained to a varying degree with anti-CD44v5, anti-CD44v7-v8, and anti-CD44v10. Exons v6 and v7 were not detected on any of these tissue specimens. Compared with nevi, expression of exon v10 was up-regulated in thick primary tumors and skin metastases. Lymph node metastases displayed elevated levels of exon v5. Expression of CD44v in melanoma lines (n = 20) differed, inasmuch as many lines did not express variant isoforms; in particular, exon v10. Interestingly, however, the few CD44v5-positive melanoma lines metastasized in the nu/nu mouse. Because benign as well as malignant growth of melanocytes was accompanied by expression of CD44 variant isoforms, a linkage between expression of CD44 variant isoforms and malignant transformation or tumor progression was excluded. Considering the function of distinct isoforms, one might speculate that expression of exon CD44v5, which was up-regulated in lymph node metastases compared with nevi and primary melanoma, provided a growth stimulus. Exon v10 is present at high density in epidermal cells. The de novo expression of this exon in nevi and the increased expression in thick melanoma and skin metastases would be in line with the assumption of an anchoring advantage in the surrounding epidermal tissue.",

The underlying mechanisms of melanoma brain metastasis development are not well understood. Identification of molecular determinants regulating melanoma brain metastasis would advance the development of prevention and therapy strategies for this disease. Gene expression profiles of cutaneous and brain-metastasizing melanoma variants from three xenograft tumor models established in our laboratory revealed that expression of tight junction component CLDN1 was lower in the brain-metastasizing variants than in cutaneous variants from the same melanoma. The objective of our study was to determine the significance of CLDN1 downregulation/loss in metastatic melanoma and its role in melanoma brain metastasis. An immunohistochemical analysis of human cells of the melanocyte lineage indicated a significant CLDN1 downregulation in metastatic melanomas. Transduction of melanoma brain metastatic cells expressing low levels of CLDN1 with a CLDN1 retrovirus suppressed their metastatic phenotype. CLDN1-overexpressing melanoma cells expressed a lower ability to migrate and adhere to extracellular matrix, reduced tumor aggressiveness in nude mice and, most importantly, eliminated the formation of micrometastases in the brain. In sharp contrast, the ability of the CLDN1-overexpressing cells to form lung micrometastases was not impaired. CLDN1-mediated interactions between these cells and brain endothelial cells constitute the mechanism underlying these results. Taken together, we demonstrated that downregulation or loss of CLDN1 supports the formation of melanoma brain metastasis, and that CLDN1 expression could be a useful prognostic predictor for melanoma patients with a high risk of brain metastasis.

We show here that a rise in intracellular-free calcium ion (Ca2+), induced by Ca2+-ionophore A23187, exerted a deleterious effect on glycolysis and viability of B16 melanoma cells. Ca2+-ionophore caused a dose-dependent detachment of phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11), one of the key enzymes of glycolysis, from cytoskeleton. It also induced a decrease in the levels of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the two stimulatory signal molecules of glycolysis. All these changes occurred at lower concentrations of the drug than those required to induce a reduction in viability of melanoma cells. We also found that low concentrations of Ca2+-ionophore induced an increase in adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), which most probably resulted from the increase in mitochondrial-bound hexokinase, which reflects a defence mechanism. This mechanism can no longer operate at high concentrations of the Ca2+-ionophore, which causes a decrease in mitochondrial and cytosolic hexokinase, leading to a drastic fall in ATP and melanoma cell death. The present results suggest that drugs which are capable of inducing accumulation of intracellular-free Ca2+ in melanoma cells would cause a reduction in energy-producing systems, leading to melanoma cell death.",

Nevertheless, acquired resistance and nonresponders to therapy require different strategies. An innovative approach is presented here that is based on the combination of innate immune system activation and simultaneous targeting of the oncogene urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). We generated two triphosphate-conjugated siRNAs targeting uPAR (ppp-uPAR) by in vitro transcription. Specific uPAR knockdown and simultaneous activation of the retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) was shown in different human melanoma cells, fibroblasts, and melanocytes. The compounds induced massive apoptosis in melanoma cells, whereas fibroblasts and melanocytes were less sensitive. The effects were less pronounced when the IFN receptor was blocked. Treatment with ppp-uPAR led to accumulation of p53 and induction of RIG-I-dependent proapoptotic signaling. The apoptotic effects induced by ppp-uPAR were maintained in melanoma cell lines that had acquired double resistance to B-RAF and MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibition. Systemic intraperitoneal application of ppp-uPAR in nude mice significantly reduced growth of human melanoma xenografts and elicited a systemic innate immune response with increased serum cytokine levels.

In order to determine whether K(+) channel activity is a general requirement for locomotion, we extended our observations to NIH3T3 fibroblasts and human melanoma cells. Migration of both cell types and its dependence on K(+) channel activity was measured at the single cell level by time lapse photography in the absence and presence of the specific K(+) channel blocker charybdotoxin (CTX). Locomotion of both cell types is inhibited by K(+) channel blockade. CTX slows down migration of fibroblasts and of melanoma cells dose-dependently by up to 61 +/- 11%. These findings suggest that K(+) channel activity is a general prerequisite for migration. To determine whether CTX-induced inhibition of migration of fibroblasts and melanoma cells involves quantitative changes of actin filaments, we indirectly measured filamentous actin by quantitating binding of fluorescently labeled phalloidin. Whereas CTX elicits a decrease of bound phalloidin in fibroblasts there is an increase in melanoma cells. Since migration of tumor cells is required for invading surrounding tissue, we developed an assay to test whether CTX-induced inhibition of migration also impairs invasion of melanoma cells. Melanoma cells were seeded on a layer of high resistance renal epithelial cells (MDCK cells clone C7; transepithelial resistance R(te) >3,000 Omegacm(2)) and R(te) was measured daily. R(te) starts to decrease 2 days after seeding of melanoma cells onto MDCK-C7 cells. By day 7, R(te) has dropped to 24 +/- 1.5% of control. K(+) channel blockade with CTX (10 nmol/l) cannot prevent or delay this drop of R(te). R(te) reaches the same level with or without CTX. These results indicate that the disruption of an epithelial layer, unlike migration of melanoma cells, cannot be modulated by K(+) channel blockade.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Mouse melanoma B16 F1 cells cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with the melanin precursors tyrosine and phenylalanine display increased melanin levels and elevated migration while down-regulating protein kinase C (PKC)zeta to low levels. Although control experiments rule out a direct role by melanin, PKCzeta down-regulation is shown to be a critical determinant of cell migration. Transfection of high-motility cells with either wild-type PKCzeta or its regulatory domain suppresses migration. Known to bind to the regulatory domain of PKCzeta, the proapoptotic protein prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) coimmunoprecipitates with PKCzeta as a 47-kDa protein. Transfection of Par-4 (or its leucine zipper element) further suppresses migration of low-motility cells (which express high levels of PKCzeta), whereas high-motility cells (which express low levels of PKCzeta) are unaffected by Par-4 overexpression. It is proposed that in nonmetastatic cells, the PKCzeta Par-4 complex provides a brake on migration that is released by melanin precursors that initiate PKCzeta down-regulation. Elevation of PKCzeta in melanoma cells, or preventing its down-regulation through the dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine, may therefore control metastatic behavior.",

In contrast to melanoma cells, normal melanocytes, even under optimal growth conditions, express only TGF-beta 1 and MGSA at detectable levels suggesting that production of the other growth factors is a tumor-associated phenomenon. Recent evidence suggests that at least two of the growth factors, bFGF and MGSA, contribute to autocrine growth stimulation of melanoma cells. Whether PDGF, TGF-alpha, IL-1, and TGF-beta act in an autocrine mode is unclear at present. However, these four growth factors are among those secreted by melanoma cells and, therefore, can be expected to interact with normal cells of the tumor stroma in vivo.

Here, we show that, in clonally derived mouse K1735 melanoma variant cell lines with high (M-2) and low (C-23) metastatic potential, elevated expression of alpha7 correlates with reduced cell motility, metastasis, and tumor growth. Both cell lines showed similar beta1 integrin-dependent adhesion to laminin-1 and the E8 laminin fragment. However, the highly metastatic M-2 cells rapidly migrated on laminin, whereas the nonmetastatic C-23 cells were minimally motile. Laminin-binding integrin profiles showed that the M-2 cells expressed moderate amounts of alpha1 and abundant alpha6 but low or undetectable levels of alpha2 and alpha7. By contrast, C-23 cells expressed low or undetectable levels of alpha1, alpha2, and alpha6 but had up-regulated levels of alpha7. Consistent with the protein data, Northern blot analysis showed that levels of alpha7 mRNA were highest in the poorly metastatic variant cells, whereas alpha6 message was not detected; in contrast, alpha6 mRNA was elevated in the highly metastatic cells, whereas alpha7 message was not detected. Forced expression of alpha7 in the M-2 cells suppressed cell motility, tumor growth, and metastasis. Collectively, these results indicate that, during melanoma progression, acquisition of a highly tumorigenic and metastatic melanoma phenotype is associated with loss of the alpha7beta1 laminin receptor.",

Regular Cox PH models were then fit with the markers selected by the Lasso PH.

In addition, several amino acid exchanges cause the oncogenic receptor to be highly active, resulting in a strong tyrosine phosphorylation even without growth factor stimulation. Besides the receptor itself a Xmrk-specific signal transduction seems to be a critical part of the transformation machinery.

As we previously reported, most of the melanoma vaccines failed to show any major impact on the disease, except for the autologous whole cell vaccine. This can be explained by the heterogeneous nature of cutaneous melanoma that expresses various levels of melanoma antigens, peptides and has various genetic profiles among different patients. From an immunological point of view, it is illogic to eliminate the tumor and its specific antigens then apply allogenic type of therapy and expect a tumor response. Therefore, it is more logical is to utilize the tumor site as a source for the tumor-specific antigens. In the meantime, patients with in-transit metastases can give us an excellent opportunity to evaluate the local and systemic effects of intralesional (intratumoral) therapy, and various agents have been utilized with equivocal results. On the other hand, intralesional administration of 2 cytokines seemed to process the tumor antigens and activates thymic-derived lymphocytes (T cells). This can induce an antitumor immune response in vivo, i.e., autoimmunization (auto-vaccination), specific to each patient, and overcome tumor heterogeneity regardless to its antigenic or genetic profiles.

Identification of patients at high risk of metastases may provide indication for a frequent follow-up for early detection of metastases and treatment. The analysis of the gene expression profiles of primary human uveal melanomas showed high expression of SDCBP gene (encoding for syndecan-binding protein-1 or mda-9/syntenin), which appeared higher in patients with recurrence, whereas expression of syndecans was lower and unrelated to progression. Moreover, we found that high expression of SDCBP gene was related to metastatic progression in two additional independent datasets of uveal melanoma patients. More importantly, immunohistochemistry showed that high expression of mda-9/syntenin protein in primary tumors was significantly related to metastatic recurrence in our cohort of patients. Mda-9/syntenin expression was confirmed by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry in cultured uveal melanoma cells or primary tumors. Interestingly, mda-9/syntenin showed both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in cell lines and in a fraction of patients, suggesting its possible involvement in nuclear functions. A pseudo-metastatic model of uveal melanoma to the liver was developed in NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ null mice and the study of mda-9/syntenin expression in primary and metastatic lesions revealed higher mda-9/syntenin in metastases. The inhibition of SDCBP expression by siRNA impaired the ability of uveal melanoma cells to migrate in a wound-healing assay. Moreover, silencing of SDCBP in mda-9/syntenin-high uveal melanoma cells inhibited the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-triggered invasion of matrigel membranes and inhibited the activation of FAK, AKT and Src. Conversely syntenin overexpression in mda-9/syntenin-low uveal melanoma cells mediated opposite effects. These results suggest that mda-9/syntenin is involved in uveal melanoma progression and that it warrants further investigation as a candidate molecular marker of metastases and a potential therapeutic target.",

Twenty-five neoplasms were metallothionein-positive, and 19 were metallothionein-negative.

In the American College of Surgeons Melanoma Survey of 4,545 melanoma patients diagnosed during 1980, the typical melanoma was relatively thin (less than 1.5 millimeters), not ulcerated (except in 9 per cent) and did not invade into the reticular dermis or beyond (level IV or V). The melanomas were most commonly located on the trunk in men and on the lower extremities in women. Eighty-eight per cent of the patients had no clinical evidence of metastases to regional nodes or to distant sites at the time of initial diagnosis. Only a small proportion (1 per cent) of patients in the survey were black and in most of these patients, their melanoma were located on the feet or hands. The treatment of melanoma was surgical in 92.5 per cent of the patients, with the majority of patients undergoing a wide excision of the melanoma as the initial form of treatment. Only one-fifth of the patients underwent elective regional node dissection for suspected micrometastases, and most of these patients had a tumor thickness exceeding 1.5 millimeters or a lesion invading to the reticular dermis (level III, IV or V). While the Breslow Microstaging Method is now recognized as the most important parameter that predicts the clinical course of the patient, this parameter was reported in only 45 per cent of the patients in the survey. The natural history of melanoma is changing, since the disease is increasing in frequency and becoming more curable. Surgical treatment should be tailored to the biologic aggressiveness of each individual patient's melanoma. This can be estimated by integrating such prognostic factors as the melanoma thickness, the presence or absence of ulceration, the level of invasion, the anatomic site and the gender of the patient.",

The results reveal quantitative differences between benign and malignant lesions. Significantly higher cortactin expression is found in melanomas than in nevi (P<0.0001), with levels greater in metastatic than in invasive melanomas (P<0.05). Qualitatively, tumor tissues often show aberrant cortactin localization at the cell periphery, corresponding to its colocalization with filamentous actin in cell cortex of cultured melanoma cells. This suggests an additional level of protein dysregulation. Furthermore, in patients with metastatic disease, high-level cortactin expression correlates with poor disease-specific survival. Our data, in conjunction with outcome data on several other types of human cancers and experimental data from melanoma cell lines, supports a potential role of aberrant cortactin expression in melanoma tumor progression and a rational for targeting key elements of actin-signaling pathway for developmental therapeutics in melanomas.",

Using both microcomplement fixation and indirect immunofluorescence, no significant reactivity was noted in several nonmelanoma cell lines including Hela, human lung adenocarcinoma, human prostatic carcinoma, WI-38 and VA-13 cell lines. These data suggest that common melanoma membrane antigens exist on 7 of 10 cultured human melanoma cell lines as tested by microcomplement fixation and that this assay is more sensitive than immunofluorescence. These common melanoma membrane antigens may eventually be extracted, purified and used for specific immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy.",

Because cell cycle progression is dependent on the transcriptional activity of E2F family members (E2F1-E2F6), most of them regulated by suppressive association with pocket proteins, we characterized E2F-pocket protein DNA binding activity in normal versus malignant human melanocytes. By gel shift analysis, we show that in mitogen-dependent normal melanocytes, external growth factors tightly controlled the levels of growth-promoting free E2F DNA binding activity, composed largely of E2F2 and E2F4, and the growth-suppressive E2F4-p130 complexes. In contrast, in melanoma cells, free E2F DNA binding activity (E2F2 and E2F4, to a lesser extent E2F1, E2F3, and occasionally E2F5), was constitutively maintained at high levels independently of external melanocyte mitogens. E2F1 was the only family member more abundant in the melanoma cells compared with normal melanocytes, and the approximately fivefold increase in DNA binding activity could be accounted for mostly by a similar increase in the levels of the dimerization partner DP1. The continuous high expression of cyclin D1, A2, and E, the persistent cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK2 activities, and the presence of hyperphosphorylated forms of pRb, p107, and p130, suggest that melanoma cells acquired the capacity for autonomous growth through inactivation of all three pocket proteins and release of E2F activity, otherwise tightly regulated in normal melanocytes by external growth factors.",

In this study, we examined the effect of overexpression and inhibition of let-7b and microRNA-199a. Plasmids overexpressing these genes were transfected into B16F10 melanoma cells, and let-7b and microRNA-199a expression were evaluated at the RNA, protein and cellular level. Cyclin D1 expression was significantly higher in cells transfected with let-7b plasmid and let-7b inhibitor compared with control cells (P<0.05). In turn, Met expression in the microRNA-199a plasmid group and microRNA-199a inhibitor group was significantly higher than in the control group (P<0.05). The proliferation rate of B16F10 cells transfected with let-7b or microRNA-199a was lower than that of the control group, particularly until the third day after transfection when the proliferation rate dropped to the lowest value (P<0.05). In addition, the apoptosis rates of the let-7b plasmid group and microRNA-199a plasmid group were significantly higher compared to that of the control group (P<0.05).

Here we use a series of melanoma cell lines that recapitulate the phenotypic characteristics of melanomas at varying stages of malignant progression to evaluate the expression levels of Id1 in this model system and determine the mechanism of Id1 dysregulation in these tumor cells. We find elevated protein levels of Id1 to be present consistently in radial growth phase tumor cells in accordance with our primary tumor data. Id1 transcript levels were also found to be elevated in these radial growth phase melanoma cells without any appreciable evidence of gene amplification and Id1 promoter activity was found to correlate with Id expression levels.

To be included, studies had to be primary research articles with family physicians as the subjects and dermoscopy training and use as the intervention. Four papers met all inclusion criteria and provided level I evidence according to the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care definition.;Among family physicians, dermoscopy has higher sensitivity for melanoma detection than naked-eye examination with generally no decrease in specificity. Dermoscopy also helps to increase family physicians' confidence in their preliminary diagnosis of lesions. When using dermoscopy, compared with naked-eye examination, there is a higher likelihood that a lesion assessed as being malignant is in fact malignant and that a lesion assessed as being benign is in fact benign.;Dermoscopy has been shown to be a useful and fairly inexpensive tool for melanoma detection in family practice.

We recently showed that EphA2 is also upregulated by ultraviolet radiation and is able to induce apoptosis. These findings suggest that EphA2 may have different, even paradoxical, effects on viability depending on the cellular context and that EphA2 mediates a delicate balance between life and death of the cell. To functionally clarify EphA2's role in melanoma, we analyzed a panel of melanoma cell lines and found that EphA2 levels are elevated in a significant fraction of the samples. Specific depletion of EphA2 in high-expressing melanoma cells using short hairpin RNA led to profound reductions in cellular viability, colony formation and migration in vitro and a dramatic loss of tumorigenic potential in vivo. Stable introduction of EphA2 into low-expressing cell lines enhanced proliferation, colony formation and migration, further supporting its pro-malignant phenotype. Interestingly, transient expression of EphA2 and/or Braf(V600E) in non-transformed melanocytes led to significant and additive apoptosis. These results verify that EphA2 is an important oncogene and potentially a common source of 'addiction' for many melanoma cells. Moreover, acute induction of EphA2 may purge genetically susceptible cells, thereby uncovering a more aggressive population that is in fact dependent on the oncogene.",

In contrast, MHC expression in metastatic melanomas drastically decreased compared to VGP melanomas, despite still prevalent DNA copy number gains. Subsequent investigations found that the master transactivator of MHC genes, CIITA, was also significantly downregulated in metastatic melanomas when compared to VGP melanomas. This could be one of the mechanisms accounting for the discrepancy between DNA copy number and expression level in metastatic melanomas, a potentially separate mechanism of gene regulation.

A few years later cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) was also identified as a melanoma susceptibility gene. The technologic advances have allowed the identification of new genes involved in melanoma susceptibility: Breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) associated protein 1 (BAP1), CXC genes, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), protection of telomeres 1 (POT1), ACD and TERF2IP, the latter four being involved in telomere maintenance. Furthermore variants in melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) give a moderately increased risk to develop melanoma. Melanoma genetic counseling is offered to families in order to better understand the disease and the genetic susceptibility of developing it. Genetic counseling often implies genetic testing, although patients can benefit from genetic counseling even when they do not fulfill the criteria for these tests.

Recently, the transcription factor Sox10 has been shown to promote both melanoma initiation and progression. Reducing SOX10 expression levels in human melanoma cells and in a genetic melanoma mouse model, efficiently abolishes tumorigenesis by inducing cell cycle exit and apoptosis. Here, we show that this anti-tumorigenic effect functionally involves SOX9, a factor related to SOX10 and upregulated in melanoma cells upon loss of SOX10. Unlike SOX10, SOX9 is not required for normal melanocyte stem cell function, the formation of hyperplastic lesions, and melanoma initiation. To the contrary, SOX9 overexpression results in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and a gene expression profile shared by melanoma cells with reduced SOX10 expression. Moreover, SOX9 binds to the SOX10 promoter and induces downregulation of SOX10 expression, revealing a feedback loop reinforcing the SOX10 low/SOX9 high ant,m/ii-tumorigenic program. Finally, SOX9 is required in vitro and in vivo for the anti-tumorigenic effect achieved by reducing SOX10 expression. Thus, SOX10 and SOX9 are functionally antagonistic regulators of melanoma development. ",

In this study, we investigated the role of genes involved in DNA repair in a panel of human melanoma cell variants exhibiting low and high levels of resistance to 4 commonly used drugs in melanoma treatment, i.e., vindesine, etoposide, fotemustine and cisplatin. We show that in melanoma cells exhibiting resistance to cisplatin, etoposide and vindesine, the nuclear content of each of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins hMLH1, hMSH2 and hMSH6 was reduced by 30-70%. A decreased expression level of up to 80% of mRNAs encoding hMLH1 and hMSH2 was observed in drug-resistant melanoma cells selected for cisplatin, etoposide and fotemustine, while vindesine-selected cells showed only moderate reduction. In melanoma cells that acquired resistance to fotemustine, the amount of nuclear MMR proteins was nearly unaltered, whereas the activity of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) was considerably enhanced. Activity of N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (MPG) was not significantly altered in any of the drug-resistant melanoma cells. Our data indicate that modulation of both MMR components and MGMT expression level may contribute to the drug-resistant phenotype of melanoma cells.",

We elected to study the germline variant Q472H in the kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), which was identified in 35% of melanoma patients in both a pilot and an independent 1,223 patient cohort. Using patient-derived melanoma cell lines and human samples, we assessed proliferation, invasion, VEGF levels, and angiogenesis by analyzing tumor microvessel density (MVD) using anti-CD34 antibody.;Serum VEGF levels and tumor MVD were significantly higher in Q472H versus KDR wild-type (WD) patients. Primary cultures derived from melanomas harboring the KDR variant were more proliferative and invasive than KDR wild type. Finally, using a VEGFR2 antibody, we showed that KDR Q472H cells were sensitive to targeted inhibition of VEGFR2, an effect that was not observed in KDR WT cells.;Our data support the integration of germline analysis into personalized treatment decision-making and suggest that patients with germline KDR variant might benefit from antiangiogenesis treatment.

Using western blotting, indirect immunofluorescence, and RT-PCR, leptin receptors were found to be expressed by human melanoma cells. In contrast, cultured melanocytes expressed message for the receptor without detectable protein. Melanoma cells responded to treatment with leptin by activating the MAPK pathway and proliferating. Melanoma cells but not melanocytes, also expressed leptin protein, creating a potential autocrine loop. Examination of human melanoma tumors by immunohistochemistry revealed that melanomas and nevi expressed leptin at a high frequency. Melanomas also strongly expressed the leptin receptor, whereas nevi expressed this receptor to a much lesser degree. We conclude that leptin is a melanoma growth factor and that a leptin autocrine-loop may contribute to the uncontrolled proliferation of these cells.",

Melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) has been shown to play an essential role in the progression of malignant melanoma and to influence melanoma-associated molecules and pathways in the early tumor formation steps. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that MIA is a regulator of p54(nrb). Here, we show that p54(nrb) is strongly expressed and localized in the nucleus of both melanoma cell lines and melanoma tissue samples compared with normal human melanocytes or normal skin, respectively. Furthermore, all tested melanoma cell lines revealed strong p54(nrb) promoter activity. Treatment with MIA-specific small interfering RNAs showed an influence of MIA on p54(nrb) expression on both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein level. Knockdown of p54(nrb) protein in melanoma cell lines led to reduced proliferation rates and to a strong decrease in their migratory potential. In addition, attachment to laminin and poly-l-lysine was significantly increased. We could identify Connexin-43 (Cx-43) as a downstream target molecule of p54(nrb) as knockdown of p54(nrb) resulted in enhanced Cx-43 mRNA and protein levels. As a confirmation of these findings, melanoma cell lines showed very low Cx-43 expression levels compared with melanocytes.

Our findings revealed that male gender, advanced disease stage, lymph node involvement, lymphatic invasion, the presence of ulceration, and a high Clark level were significant negative prognostic factors.;In light of the favorable survival results obtained in this study, high-dose interferon treatment as adjuvant therapy for high-risk melanoma is still an efficient treatment and its possible side effects can be prevented by taking the necessary precautions.",

All major pathological types of malignant melanoma occur in South Australia, with a marked preponderance of the superficial spreading type. On the basis of level of invasion and thickness, more than half of the tumours have a good prognosis. The most common reason for excision of melanomas was the observation of a change in the lesion, but some were excised after incidental recognition by a medical practitioner during medical examination for other reasons.",

These doses were preceded by an infusion of cold irrelevant antibody. The average serum T1/2 of the F(ab')2 and the Fab were 11 hr and 2 hr, respectively. Twenty-two percent (22%) of the total injected F(ab')2 dose was excreted in the urine in 20 hr, compared to 55% for the Fab group. Imaging was optimal 6-9 hr postinjection for the Fab patients. No nonspecific uptake in liver, spleen, bone marrow, or lung was observed for either antibody form. Overall, (43/53) 81% of known metastases were seen with visualization of tumors as small as 250 mg and tumor localization as high as 0.03% injected dose/g. Immunoperoxidase staining of freshly-frozen tumor nodules removed 24 hr postinjection confirmed antibody deposition in the tumor. Thirty-six previously unknown (\"occult\") metastatic sites were detected. To date, 12/36 of these sites have been confirmed.

Amentoflavone treatment significantly reduced tumor nodule formation accompanied by reduced lung collagen hydroxyproline, hexosamine, and uronic acid levels. Serum sialic acid and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase levels were also significantly inhibited after amentoflavone treatment. Amentoflavone treatment up-regulated the lung tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-2 expression. The cytokine profile and growth factors such as interleukin-1beta , interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, granulocyte monocyte- colony stimulating factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-2, and tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-1 in the serum of these animals were markedly altered after amentoflavone treatment. This altered level of cytokines after amentoflavone treatment was also accompanied by enhanced natural killer cell antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The study reveals that amentoflavone treatment could alter proinflammatory cytokine production and could inhibit the activation and nuclear translocation of p65, p50, c-Rel subunits of nuclear factor-kappaB, and other transcription factors such as c-fos, activated transcription factor-2, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein in B16F-10 melanoma cells.",

Seventy-seven blood samples of 59 melanoma patients were analyzed for tyrosinase, Melan-A/MART-1, MAGE-3, gp100, and p97 expression by multimarker RT-PCR; 540 serum samples of 352 melanoma patients were analyzed for S-100 protein concentration by LIA.

In a direct comparison, 31 identical samples were analyzed by multimarker RT-PCR and by S-100 LIA. In stage III 18.2% and in stage IV 45% of the samples were positive by multimarker RT-PCR versus 45.5% and 80% by S-100 LIA, respectively.

Compared to the TNM classification used for the previous 15 years, the new classification contains fundamental changes. The classification of the primary tumor is now based on newly defined classes for Breslow's tumor thickness (0 - 1.0 mm; 1.01 - 2.0 mm, 2.01 - 4.0 mm; > 4.0 mm). Histopathologically diagnosed ulceration is the second prognostic factor in primary melanoma and its presence leads to upstaging into the next higher T category. Clark level of invasion is now only relevant for tumors up to 1 mm thick; levels IV and V are also reasons for upstaging. Classification of regional lymph node metastasis distinguishes between microscopic metastasis only as detected with sentinel lymph node biopsy and clinically detectable macroscopic metastasis. Additionally, the number of metastatic nodes and the presence of satellite and in-transit metastasis are prognostic factors for classification of regional lymph node metastasis. In distant metastasis, the kind of organ involvement has a role for classification (only skin and lymph nodes vs. lung vs. other organs) and an elevated LDH value leads to upstaging. A critical analysis of data of the German Central Malignant Melanoma Registry did not confirm the strong role of histopathological ulceration of the primary tumor in all T- and N-stages. Furthermore, there is an inconsistency of the classification as stage IIC displays a significantly worse prognosis as compared to stage IIIA. In spite of these drawbacks the new staging classification should used particularly in clinical trials in order to make data internationally comparable.",

Pairwise univariate statistical comparison was used for the coarse selection of the most significant risk factors. These factors were fed into logistic regression (LR) and alternating decision trees (ADT) prognostic models that were assessed for their usefulness in identification of patients at risk to develop melanoma. Validation of the LR model was done by Hosmer and Lemeshow test, whereas the ADT was validated by 10-fold cross-validation. The achieved sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and AUC for both models were calculated. The melanoma risk score (MRS) based on the outcome of the LR model was presented.;The LR model showed that the following risk factors were associated with melanoma: sunbeds (OR = 4.018; 95% CI 1.724-9.366 for those that sometimes used sunbeds), solar damage of the skin (OR = 8.274; 95% CI 2.661-25.730 for those with severe solar damage), hair color (OR = 3.222; 95% CI 1.984-5.231 for light brown/blond hair), the number of common naevi (over 100 naevi had OR = 3.57; 95% CI 1.427-8.931), the number of dysplastic naevi (from 1 to 10 dysplastic naevi OR was 2.672; 95% CI 1.572-4.540; for more than 10 naevi OR was 6.487; 95%; CI 1.993-21.119), Fitzpatricks phototype and the presence of congenital naevi.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-98 inhibits melanoma cell migration in vitro as well as metastatic tumor size in vivo.

As melanocytes share with the nervous system a common neuroectodermal origin and express all neurotrophins (NTs), we evaluated the expression and function of NTs and their receptors in melanoma.

Moreover, melanoma cells express the low-affinity (p75NTR) and the high-affinity tyrosine kinase NT receptors (Trk). The inhibition of Trk receptors by either K252a or Trk/Fc chimeras prevents proliferation, indicating that autocrine NTs are responsible for this effect. NT-3, NT-4, and nerve growth factor (NGF) induce cell migration, with a stronger effect on metastatic cell lines. Transfection with p75NTR small interfering RNA (p75NTRsiRNA) or treatment with K252a inhibits NT-induced melanoma cell migration, indicating that both the low- and high-affinity NT receptors mediate this effect. All melanoma cell lines express the p75NTR coreceptor sortilin by which proNGF stimulates migration in melanoma cells, but not in cells transfected with p75NTRsiRNA.

This manuscript discusses the design of the WAMHS and the characteristics of the participants.;Participants were recruited through the Western Australian Cancer Registry, which is notified of all incident cancers in the state of Western Australia by law. Once the diagnosing doctor's consent was obtained, all eligible, resident Western Australian, adult cases of melanoma diagnosed between January 2006 and September 2009, were contacted by mail and invited to participate. Clinical, questionnaire-based phenotypic and blood samples for extraction of DNA, RNA and serum were collected from consenting cases. Clinical data consisted of all pathological data recorded by the cancer registry and the questionnaire, administered by telephone interview, covered major risk factors for melanoma, such as sun exposure history and skin type.;The final sample consisted of 1643 consenting cases out of 3420 cancer notifications (48.04%), of which 1455 cases completed one or more components of the study and 1157 completed all components. The WAMHS sample differed to all melanoma notifications only in age, with a bias towards older individuals (P<0.0001). No significant differences were observed in sex, melanoma site, Breslow thickness or Clark's level.;The WAMHS study is novel in its non-family based approach and focus on common (low penetrance) genetic determinants.

Subjects were a population-based sample of melanoma cases diagnosed and registered in Queensland between 1982 and 1990 and their relatives. The analysis included 1,263 cases and relatives with confirmed cutaneous melanoma and 3,111 first-degree relatives without melanoma as controls. Data on lifetime residence and sun exposure, family history and other melanoma risk factors were collected by a mailed questionnaire. Using conditional multiple logistic regression with stratification by family, cumulative sun exposure in childhood and in adulthood after age 20 was significantly associated with melanoma, with estimated relative risks of 1.15 per 5,000 minimal erythemal doses (MEDs) from age 5 to 12 years, and 1.52 per 5 MEDs/day from age 20.

However, microscopically, the tumor showed histopathologic features consistent with a high-grade acral (mucosal) lentiginous melanoma with overt cytomorphologic features of malignancy in addition to showing prominent pigment synthesis resembling animal-type melanoma.

In vitro studies have suggested that the 72 kD type IV collagenase (MMP-2) may be important in melanoma invasion. It has recently been demonstrated that the expression of MMP-2 immunoreactive protein increased with increasing atypia in melanocytic tumours and was associated with later haematogenous metastases in melanoma. This paper investigates the value of MMP-2 as a possible prognostic marker in melanoma. The expression of MMP-2 immunoreactive protein was studied with immunoperoxidase staining in paraffin-embedded sections of 50 cases of primary skin melanoma by using specific, affinity purified antibodies. Positive immunostaining was quantified by counting the percentage of positive cancer cells and was compared with clinical patient characteristics and survival. Sixty-four per cent of the primary melanoma cases displayed positive cytoplasmic immunostaining for MMP-2 in tumour cells. Marked overexpression of MMP-2 protein (> or = 34 per cent of melanoma cells positive) correlated with the 5-year survival of the patients when compared with patients with lower MMP-2 positivity, 55 per cent vs. 85 per cent, respectively (P < 0.05). Male patients displayed positive staining more often than females (75 per cent vs. 54 per cent, respectively). There was no correlation between MMP-2 positivity and Clark level or Breslow classification. A distinct group with unfavourable prognosis was identified. The 10-year survival for MMP-2-positive male melanoma patients was 39 per cent as opposed to 79 per cent with the other melanoma patients (P < 0.05). In the hierarchic Cox regression model for survival, MMP-2 immunoreactive protein was found to be independent of Clark level and Breslow classification. Overexpression of MMP-2 protein indicated a 4.5-fold relative risk of dying from melanoma. It is concluded that MMP-2 immunoreactive protein in melanoma cells is an independent prognostic factor for survival. High MMP-2 expression in male melanoma patients indicates an unfavourable prognosis.",

Approximately one-third of melanoma patients had elevated MIF and MLANA transcripts (p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively) compared with healthy controls. In contrast, healthy controls had uniformly higher levels of TYR and MITF than melanoma patients (p<0.0001). There was a marked shift of leukocytes into the CTC-enriched fractions (a 430% increase in RNA recovery, p<0.001), and no relationship between CTC levels and stage of disease was found. CTCs were captured on microfabricated filters and cultured. Captured melanoma CTCs were large cells, and consisted of 2 subpopulations, based on immunoreactivity. One subpopulation (∼50%) stained for both pan-cytokeratin (KRT) markers and the common leukocyte marker CD-45, whereas the second subpopulation stained for only KRT. Since similar cells are described in many cancers, we also examined blood from colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients. We observed analogous results, with most captured CTCs staining for both CD-45/KRT markers (and for the monocyte differentiation marker CD-14). Our results suggest that immature melanocyte-related cells (expressing TYR and MITF RNA) may circulate in healthy controls, although they are not readily detectable without considerable enrichment. Further, as early-stage melanomas develop, immature melanocyte migration into the blood is somehow curtailed, whereas a significant proportion of patients develop elevated CTC levels (based on MIF and MLANA RNAs). The nature of the captured CTCs is consistent with literature describing leukocyte/macrophage-tumor cell fusion hybrids, and their role in metastatic progression.",

IL-1 family member proteins are known to be expressed constitutively in many melanoma tumor cells, and we hypothesize that these support molecular pathways of inflammation and facilitate tumor growth. To investigate the expression of IL-1α and IL-1β in melanoma patients, and their association with disease progression, immunohistochemical staining was carried out on tissues from 170 patients including benign nevi, primary melanomas, and metastatic melanomas. IL-1β levels were low (or zero) in benign nevi and higher in primary and metastatic melanomas (P < 0.0001). IL-1α was expressed in about 73% of nevi and 55% of metastatic melanomas, with levels significantly higher in primary tumors (P < 0.0001); most (98%) primary melanoma samples were positive for IL-1α. In vitro studies with seven human melanoma cell lines showed that five cell lines expressed IL-1α and IL-1β proteins and mRNA. We identified for the first time several important downstream signaling pathways affected by endogenous IL-1, including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, COX-2, and phosphorylated NF-κB inhibitor (IκB) and stress-activated protein kinase/c-jun-NH(2)-kinase; all of which were decreased by siRNA to IL-1s. Downregulation of IL-1α, IL-1β, or MyD88 substantially increased p21 and p53 levels. Treatment with IL-1 receptor type I neutralizing antibody or IL-1 pathway-specific siRNAs led to growth arrest in IL-1-positive melanoma cells. Furthermore, blocking the IL-1 pathway increased autophagy in IL-1-positive melanoma cells. These results indicate that the endogenous IL-1 system is functional in most human melanoma and interrupting its signaling inhibits the growth of IL-1-positive melanoma cells.",

A review of 313 metastatic melanomas disclosed 49 examples with rhabdoid features, from which 31 had sufficient material for further pathologic and immunohistologic characterization. A control group of 46 nonrhabdoid metastatic melanomas was examined in parallel fashion. In 39% of cases, rhabdoid melanomas manifested relative deletion of S100 protein compared with the control tumors. However, there were no differences in staining with HMB-45. Vimentin immunoreactivity was concentrated in the paranuclear cytoplasm of rhabdoid melanoma cells. However, ultrastructural studies of these cases failed to show corresponding whorls of intermediate filaments and instead demonstrated paracrystalline paranuclear inclusions in profiles of rough endoplasmic reticulum. It is concluded that metastatic rhabdoid melanoma exhibits significant morphologic similarity to other rhabdoid tumors at a light-microscopic level. However, it usually retains enough melanocytic attributes to allow for accurate diagnostic recognition. Probably because patients with metastatic melanoma have an extremely poor prognosis overall, no worsening of biologic behavior was associated with rhabdoid cytomorphologic findings in this tumor type when compared with the control cases.",

Despite genomic differences between cutaneous and uveal melanomas, therapies based on shared biological factors could be effective against both tumor types. High expression of glycoprotein-NMB (GPNMB) in cutaneous melanomas led to the development of CDX-011 (glembatumumab vedotin), a fully human monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of GPNMB conjugated to the cytotoxic microtubule toxin monomethylauristatin E. Ongoing phase II trials suggest that CDX-011 has activity against advanced cutaneous melanomas. To determine the potential role of CDX-011 in uveal melanomas, we studied their GPNMB expression. Paraffin-embedded tissues from 22 uveal melanomas treated by enucleation from 2004-2007 at one institution were evaluated immunohistochemically for expression of GPNMB using biotinylated CDX-011 (unconjugated) antibody. Melanoma cells were evaluated for percentage and intensity of expression. Spectral imaging was used in one case with high melanin content. Clinical data were reviewed. Twelve women and 10 men with a median age of 58.7 years (range: 28-83 years) were included. Eighteen of 21 tumors evaluated immunohistochemically (85.7%) expressed GPNMB in 10-90% of tumor cells with variable intensity (5 tumors, 1+; 11, 2+; and 2, 3+). Eleven of 18 tumors (61.1%) expressed GPNMB in >or=50% of cells. Spectral imaging showed diffuse CDX-011 (unconjugated) reactivity in the remaining case.

Many melanomas exhibit high levels of radioresistance. The direct consequence of gamma-irradiation for most melanoma cells is growth arrest at the G2-M phase of cell cycle. However, radiation-induced signaling pathways may affect numerous additional targets in cancer cells. We show in the present study that gamma-irradiation, as well as alpha-particle exposure, dramatically increases the susceptibility of melanoma cells to recombinant tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis via up-regulation of surface TRAIL-receptor 1/receptor 2 (DR4/DR5) levels and to Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis via up-regulation of surface Fas levels. Additionally, increased dynamin-2 expression after irradiation is critically important in the translocation of death receptor to the cell surface. Moreover, sodium arsenite treatment may up-regulate expression of endogenous TRAIL and induces its translocation to cell surface and further down-regulates cFLIP levels in melanoma cells. We have evaluated the effects of sequential gamma-irradiation and arsenite treatment of melanoma cells for the induction of death signaling. Such treatment results in an efficient TRAIL-mediated apoptosis via a paracrine mechanism. These data highlight the efficacy of combined modality treatment involving radiation and arsenite in clinical management of this often fatal form of skin cancer.",

However, the intratumoral injection of AdRGD causes limited transgene expression in healthy normal tissue, due to unwanted vector spread. Herein, we describe our attempt to overcome this limitation related to the safety of HSVtk/GCV treatment by using AdRGD carrying either melanoma-specific tyrosinase (Tyr) promoter or tumor-specific telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter instead of universal cytomegalovirus promoter. Our in vitro study revealed that Tyr promoter-regulated AdRGD exhibited high transgene expression specificity for melanoma cells, and that TERT promoter-regulated AdRGD could induce efficient gene expression in tumor cells, but was relatively quiescent in normal cells. Anti-B16BL6 melanoma effects in mice injected intratumorally with AdRGD-Tyr/HSVtk or AdRGD-TERT/HSVtk, after which GCV was injected intraperitoneally for 10 days, were comparable to those in mice injected with AdRGD-CMV/HSVtk at 10 times less vector dosage. On the other hand, AdRGD-Tyr/HSVtk and AdRGD-TERT/HSVtk did not induce severe adverse effects even when they were intravenously injected into mice at 10(9) plaque-forming units (PFU), whereas mice injected with AdRGD-CMV/HSVtk at 10(8) PFU exhibited body weight reduction and serum level increase of biochemical enzymes for hepatotoxicity.

Beneficial effects are widely documented concerning the treatment of neoplastic diseases in vivo as well as reductions in viability of cultured cells from melanoma, one of the most aggressive cancers in humans. However, studies of its effects on non-tumor cells in vitro have not focused on viability, except for experiments aiming to protect against oxidotoxicity or other toxicological insults. Furthermore, there is no agreement on the range of effective melatonin concentrations in vitro, and the mechanisms that reduce cell viability have remained unclear. Tumor cell-specific increases in the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) may provide a possible explanation. Our aim was to analyze the potential inhibition of tumor  (B16 melanoma 4A5) and non-tumor cell (3T3 Swiss albino) viability using a wide range of melatonin concentrations (10-11-10-2 M), and to determine whether intracellular ROS enhancement was involved in this process. In the absence of fetal bovine serum (FBS), low melatonin concentrations (10-9-10-5 M) reduced the proliferation of melanoma cells with no effect in fibroblasts, whereas, in the presence of FBS, they had no effect or even increased the proliferation of both fibroblast and melanoma cells. Melatonin concentrations in the upper millimolar range increased ROS levels and reduced the viability of both cell types, but more markedly so in non-tumor cells. Thus, low melatonin concentrations reduce proliferation in this specific melanoma cell line, whereas high concentrations affect the viability of both tumor (B16 4A5 melanoma) and non-tumor (3T3 fibroblasts) cells. Increased ROS levels in both lines indicate a role for ROS production in the reduction of cell viability at high-but not low-melatonin concentrations, although the mechanism of action still remains to be elucidated.",

Multivariate analysis demonstrated that pregnancy at diagnosis was significantly associated with the development of metastatic disease (p = 0.008), when controlling for tumor site, thickness, and Clark level. Pregnancy, however, was not a risk factor for patient mortality. The literature continues to be split on the role of pregnancy in melanoma; however, most recent series show no difference in survival.

We hypothesized that the clinical heterogeneity is explained by genetically distinct types of melanoma with different susceptibility to ultraviolet light.;We compared genome-wide alterations in the number of copies of DNA and mutational status of BRAF and N-RAS in 126 melanomas from four groups in which the degree of exposure to ultraviolet light differs: 30 melanomas from skin with chronic sun-induced damage and 40 melanomas from skin without such damage; 36 melanomas from palms, soles, and subungual (acral) sites; and 20 mucosal melanomas.;We found significant differences in the frequencies of regional changes in the number of copies of DNA and mutation frequencies in BRAF among the four groups of melanomas. Samples could be correctly classified into the four groups with 70 percent accuracy on the basis of the changes in the number of copies of genomic DNA. In two-way comparisons, melanomas arising on skin with signs of chronic sun-induced damage and skin without such signs could be correctly classified with 84 percent accuracy. Acral melanoma could be distinguished from mucosal melanoma with 89 percent accuracy. Eighty-one percent of melanomas on skin without chronic sun-induced damage had mutations in BRAF or N-RAS; the majority of melanomas in the other groups had mutations in neither gene. Melanomas with wild-type BRAF or N-RAS frequently had increases in the number of copies of the genes for cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and cyclin D1 (CCND1), downstream components of the RAS-BRAF pathway.;The genetic alterations identified in melanomas at different sites and with different levels of sun exposure indicate that there are distinct genetic pathways in the development of melanoma and implicate CDK4 and CCND1 as independent oncogenes in melanomas without mutations in BRAF or N-RAS.",

The HER-2 gene product expressed by cultured melanoma cells had the expected molecular weight, but no levels of tyrosine phosphorylation could be detected. Consistently, we were unable to inhibit in vitro growth of melanoma cells with an anti-gp 185HER-2 MAb, in conditions in which the growth of SKBr-3 breast-carcinoma cells was severely impaired. However, immunotoxins to gp 185HER-2 were able to kill gp185HER-2-positive melanoma cells.

Twenty-four patients with eyelid skin melanoma were identified through a search of the tumor registry at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Patients were treated between 1953 and 1994. The follow-up ranged from 3 to 18 years (mean = 9.6 years). Primary treatment in all cases entailed wide local excision of the tumor. Patients in whom regional lymph node metastasis developed underwent parotidectomy or neck dissection, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy or external beam radiation. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the patients. Survival analysis in terms of disease-free survival and recurrence-free survival was performed using age, sex, location of tumor (upper lid, lower lid, or both), histologic type of melanoma, Breslow thickness, and Clark's level as independent variables for survival.;Age, sex, location, and the histologic type of tumor were not significant prognostic indicators for survival in this cohort. Clark's level > or = IV by itself was a statistically significant predictor of decreased survival.

MTf is expressed at very low levels in normal tissues and in high amounts in melanoma cells although its function remains elusive. To understand the function of MTf, we utilized whole-genome microarray analysis to examine the gene expression profile of five models after modulating MTf expression. These models included two new stably transfected MTf hyper-expression models (SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma and LMTK- fibroblasts) and one cell type (SK-Mel-28 melanoma) where MTf was down-regulated by post-transcriptional gene silencing. These findings were compared with alterations in gene expression identified using the MTf-/- mice. In addition, the changes identified from the microarray data were also assessed in a new model of MTf down-regulation in SK-Mel-2 melanoma cells. In the cell line models, MTf hyper-expression led to increased proliferation, whereas MTf down-regulation resulted in decreased proliferation. Across all five models of MTf down- and up-regulation, we identified three genes modulated by MTf. These included ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 5, whose change in expression mirrored MTf down- or up-regulation. In addition, thiamine triphosphatase and transcription factor 4 were inversely expressed relative to MTf levels across all five models. The products of these three genes are involved in membrane transport, thiamine phosphorylation and proliferation/survival, respectively. This study identifies novel molecular targets directly or indirectly regulated by MTf and the potential pathways involved in its function, including modulation of proliferation.",

In this report, focusing our attention on the apoptotic mechanisms activated by terfenadine, we show that this drug can potentially activate distinct intrinsic signaling pathways depending on culture conditions. Serum-deprived conditions enhance the cytotoxic effect of terfenadine and caspase-4 and -2 are activated upstream of caspase-9. Moreover, although we found an increase in ROS levels, the apoptosis was ROS independent. Conversely, terfenadine treatment in complete medium induced ROS-dependent apoptosis. Caspase-4, -2, and -9 were simultaneously activated and p73 and Noxa induction were involved. ROS inhibition prevented p73 and Noxa expression but not p53 and p21 expression, suggesting a role for Noxa in p53-independent apoptosis in melanoma cells. Finally, we found that terfenadine induced autophagy, that can promote apoptosis. These findings demonstrate the great potential of terfenadine to kill melanoma cells through different cellular signaling pathways and could contribute to define new therapeutic strategies in melanoma.",
