Because c-kit expression has been reported in adenoid cystic carcinoma of various anatomic sites, we evaluated BACC for c-kit by immunohistochemical analysis, comparing the findings to similarly stained mimickers. Tested cases included 6 BACCs, 15 low-grade infiltrating ductal carcinomas (LGIDCs) chosen as potential mimickers, and 15 head-neck adenoid cystic carcinomas (HNACCs). All BACCs showed plasma membranous and cytoplasmic staining equal to or greater than that of adjacent benign epithelium. Five BACCs (83%) expressed c-kit in more than 50% of tumor cells. Only 2 of 15 LGIDCs expressed low-intensity, focal c-kit staining. Of the 15 HNACCs, 10 (67%) expressed c-kit. Hormone receptors were consistently negative in BACCs. All BACCs expressed c-kit, whereas LGIDCs infrequently expressed low-intensity c-kit. Immunohistochemical evaluation for c-kit might aid in accurately classifying carcinomas with histologic features overlapping adenoid cystic carcinoma and LGIDC.",

Adenoid cystic carcinoma may be difficult to differentiate from infiltrating duct carcinomas, and in particular from tubular and cribriform carcinomas, especially in core or vacuum-assisted biopsies. We evaluated the prevalence of c-kit, p63, and e-cadherin immunoreactivity in a series of 20 adenoid cystic carcinomas, comparing the results with those obtained in a series of infiltrating tubular carcinomas and infiltrating cribriform carcinomas. The hormone receptor status, proliferation labeling index, and HER/2 immunoreactivity had been previously investigated in all the cases. Three (15%) adenoid cystic carcinomas and all infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas showed estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor immunoreactivity (P < 0.00001 for estrogen and P = 0.00002 for progesterone receptors). Adenoid cystic carcinomas consistently lacked any immunoreactivity for HER/2, whereas three (15%) infiltrating and cribriform carcinomas showed weak and incomplete membrane staining (P = 0.23077). Membranous immunoreactivity for c-kit was found in all except one (predominantly basaloid) adenoid cystic carcinomas (95%), and in none of the infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas (P < 0.00001). Nuclear immunoreactivity for p63 was found in all except three (predominantly basaloid) adenoid cystic carcinomas (85%) and in none of the infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas (P < 0.00001). All infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas and 18/20 (90%) adenoid cystic carcinomas showed immunoreactivity for e-cadherin (P = 0.48718). In summary, adenoid cystic carcinomas showed the following phenotype: estrogen receptor-/progesterone receptor-/c-kit+/p63+ (13 cases, 65%), estrogen receptor-/progesterone receptor/c-kit+/p63- (three cases, 15%), estrogen receptor-/progesterone receptor-/c-kit-/p63+ (one case, 5%), estrogen receptor+/progesterone receptor+/c-kit+/p63+ (two cases, 10%), and estrogen receptor+/progesterone receptor-/c-kit+/p63+ (one case). By contrast, all the infiltrating tubular and cribriform carcinomas showed the estrogen receptor+/progesterone receptor+/c-kit-/p63- phenotype. Our data provide evidence that immunoreactivity for c-kit and/or p63 may be useful in differentiating adenoid cystic carcinomas from other types of breast cancer.",

The diagnosis may be even more challenging in needle core biopsies. Immunohistochemical expression of p63 and c-kit distinguishes adenoid cystic carcinoma from invasive cribriform carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ. A formal comparison of the immunophenotype of adenoid cystic carcinoma to collagenous spherulosis has not been reported. Of concern is the overlap in myoepithelial markers between these two entities. Both may express S100, smooth muscle actin, and p63. This overlap may cause diagnostic confusion yet is under-emphasized in the literature. The expression profile of newer myoepithelial markers has not been studied in this setting. We evaluated smooth muscle actin, p63, calponin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, as well as c-kit, in nine cases of cribriform pattern adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast in comparison to 12 cases of collagenous spherulosis. Both entities strongly expressed p63 and smooth muscle actin; in adenoid cystic carcinoma, the basaloid myoepithelial-like tumor cells expressed these markers, but the ductular epithelial cells did not. Neither calponin nor smooth muscle myosin heavy chain was expressed in adenoid cystic carcinoma but both were strongly expressed in collagenous spherulosis. Whereas the ductular epithelial cells of adenoid cystic carcinoma were positive for c-kit in all cases, collagenous spherulosis was negative for c-kit. Positive p63 expression by a cribriform breast lesion is not sufficiently specific to confirm a diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma. A broader panel that includes calponin or smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and c-kit is required to exclude collagenous spherulosis in settings in which the distinctive morphologic features that separate these entities are not conspicuously present. Reliance on p63 or smooth muscle actin alone poses a potential diagnostic pitfall in evaluating cribriform breast lesions.",

Patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma and c-kit positive tumours were eligible. Fourteen patients were screened and 10 patients (71%) with c-kit positive tumours entered the study. Treatment was begun at a dose of Imatinib of 400mg/day. Dose escalation was allowed in the absence of toxicity. The dose was increased to 600mg/d in three patients and 800mg/d in one patient. Three patients required dose reduction to 300mg/d, due to grade 3 toxicity. No grade 4 toxicity was seen. No objective responses were seen.

        "Doc_abstract":"Recent biological studies have classified breast carcinomas into HER2-overexpressing, estrogen receptor-positive/luminal, basal- and normal-like groups. According to this new biological classification, the objectives of our study were to assess the clinical, morphologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast in order to classify this subtype of breast carcinoma. A total of 18 cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma were identified from the Institut Curie files. Clinical information was available for 16 patients with a median follow-up of 6.5 years. Morphologically, all tumors were graded according to the system defined by Kleer and Oberman (histologic and nuclear grade). Immunophenotype was assessed with anti-ER, PR, HER-2, KIT, basal (CK5/6) and luminal cytokeratins (CK8/18) and p63 antibodies. One out of 18 tumors was nuclear grade 1 (16%), nine were nuclear grade 2 (50%) and eight were nuclear grade 3 (44%). All cases were estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER-2 negative. Epithelial cells were strongly positive around glandular lumina with one or both cytokeratins, identifying the coexistence of CK5/6+ cells, CK5/6 and CK8/18+ cells, CK8/18+ cells and p63+ cells. All cases (100%) were also KIT positive. In all, 15 patients were treated by surgery. Nine of them received adjuvant radiotherapy. Follow-up was available for 16 patients. In all, 14 patients were alive. Two of them, initially treated by surgery only, presented a local recurrence. Two patients died (one of them treated by radiation therapy only died from her disease). Our study shows that adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast is a special, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER-2 negative and highly KIT-positive, basal-like breast carcinoma, associated with an excellent prognosis. This highly specific immunophenotype could be useful to differentiate adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast from other subtypes of breast carcinoma such as cribriform carcinoma.",

These special histologic subtypes are characteristically negative for ER, PR, and HER2 (triple negative), and include adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma, and polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma. Approximately 75% of triple-negative breast carcinomas belong to the basal-like subtype by gene expression profiling. Immunohistochemical panels that include basal-like markers such as EGFR, CK5/6, p-cadherin, p63, and c-kit provide useful surrogates to gene expression arrays for classification of triple-negative breast cancers into the basal-like subtype. The purpose of this study was to explore the expression of these markers in salivary gland-like tumors of the breast.;Excisional specimens from 10 untreated invasive triple-negative mammary carcinomas with salivary gland-like morphologies were evaluated for the immunohistochemical expression of EGFR, CK5/6, p-cadherin, p63, and c-kit using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue and the L-SAB detection method.;On the basis of morphology, 5 carcinomas were classified as adenoid cystic, 3 as mucoepidermoid, and 2 as polymorphous low grade. All of the adenoid cystic carcinomas, mucoepidermoid carcinomas, and polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinomas showed strong and diffuse expression of CK5/6, p-cadherin, and p63. EGFR was expressed weakly in adenoid cystic carcinomas and polymorphous low grade, whereas mucoepidermoid carcinomas had a stronger expression.

KIT protein expression was noted in 90% of ACCs. An association between the presence of at least 50% KIT positive neoplastic cells and Grade 3 ACC or a solid growth pattern was observed (P < .05). KIT expression in normal or nonneoplastic salivary gland tissue was absent.

The most significant aspect of this treatment approach is the proof that head and neck cancers are suitable for targeted therapies as has been shown in other malignancies. Unfortunately, there are other rare histologic types of head and neck cancer such as adenocarcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma. The latter has traditionally been considered to be chemotherapy resistant and surgical resection with or without adjuvant radiation therapy has been the rule as far as treatment is concerned. The course of adenoid cystic carcinoma ranges from indolent to aggressive; however, most patients succumb to the disease as a result of distant metastases. This clinical scenario poses a challenge to oncologists. Several conventional chemotherapy regimens and novel targeted agents have been tried in this rare histologic subtype without success.;In this case report, we present a 59-year-old Caucasian female with refractory adenoid cystic carcinoma of the maxilla metastatic to the lung that responded to sorafenib, a novel multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which targets angiogenesis, Raf kinase pathway, platelet-derived growth factor Ret, and c-Kit.;This case illustrates the possibility that this chemoresistant tumor may need the inhibition or blocking of several oncogenic pathways.

In contrast, polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) has a much lower risk of recurrence and rarely metastasizes. The histologic patterns of these two neoplasms can be similar. Expression of c-kit, a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, has recently been reported to be expressed in ACC but not PLGA. Expression of galectin-3, a nonintegrin beta-galactosidase-binding lectin, has been reported to be significant in PLGA and decreased in ACC.Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from 9 ACC and 14 PLGA were immunostained for c-kit and galectin-3. Cases were scored as 1+ (5-25% positive), 2+ (26-50% positive), or 3+ (>50% positive). C-kit was expressed by 100% of ACC (3+: 7 cases; 2+: 1 case; 1+: 1 case) and by 57% of PLGA (2+: 2 cases; 1+: 6 cases). In all but one ACC, c-kit expression was confined to the inner cell layer. C-kit expression was also noted in the intercalated duct epithelium of the salivary glands and the acinar cells of the lacrimal gland. Galectin-3 was expressed in 8 of 9 cases of ACC and 14 of 14 cases of PLGA. The results of this, the first study to compare c-kit and galectin-3 expression in ACC and PLGA, suggest that c-kit expression characterizes ACC, but not PLGA. Galectin-3 immunohistochemistry does not have a role in the differentiation of ACC and PLGA. C-kit immunostaining may be a valuable adjunctive tool for this differential diagnosis, particularly in the setting of a limited biopsy.

Because stem cell factor (SCF) is c-Kit's sole ligand, we analyzed its expression in the tumor cells and their environment. Immunohistochemistry revealed its presence in c-Kit-positive tumor cells, suggesting an activation of autocrine signaling. We observed a significant induction of ERK1/2 in the cells. SCF staining was also found in other types of non-cancerous cells adjacent to tumors within salivary glands, including stromal fibroblasts, neutrophils, peripheral nerve, skeletal muscle, vascular endothelial cells, mucous acinar cells, and intercalated ducts. Quantitative PCR showed that the top quartile of c-Kit mRNA expression distinguished ACCs from normal salivary tissues and was cross-correlated with short-term poor prognosis. Expression levels of SCF and c-Kit were highly correlated in the cases with perineural invasion. These observations suggest that c-Kit is potentially activated by receptor dimerization upon stimulation by SCF in ACC, and that the highest quartile of c-Kit mRNA expression could be a predictor of poor prognosis.

Little is known about them in terms of molecular/biochemical characterization and conventional treatments are ineffective. On cryopreserved material, we analyzed the expression/activation status of TRK-A, HER-2/neu, and KIT receptors by means of immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis experiments, and the presence of their cognate ligands by means of Western blot analysis and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in 9 SDCs, 12 ACCs, and 8 normal glands. The amplification status of HER-2/neu was also investigated by means of fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis on fixed material. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-deregulated profile of the SDCs was characterized by the overexpression of activated TRK-A in the presence of its ligand, and the overexpression of HER-2/neu sustained by gene amplification. The RTK signature of the ACCs was represented by the overexpression of activated KIT and TRK-A and their cognate ligands, and the overexpression of activated HER-2/neu, in the absence of gene amplification, possibly sustained by epidermal growth factor receptor heterodimerization. In conclusion, SDCs and ACCs, although sharing TRK-A autocrine loop activation, have different pathologically activated RTK-deregulated profiles that may be potential targets for pharmacological RTK inhibitors.",

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a valuable technique in the diagnosis of GIST and may allow for preoperative therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Because of the morphologic diversity of these tumors, routine diagnosis of GIST often relies on C-Kit immunohistochemical staining in addition to morphologic findings. However, up to 15% of GISTs are C-Kit negative. Antibodies with increased sensitivity and specificity for detection of C-Kit-negative GIST cases may be of value, especially because some of these cases may also benefit from TKI therapy.;Immunohistochemical staining for DOG-1, C-Kit (CD117) and protein kinase C theta (PKCθ) was performed on FNA cell-block preparations representing 30 GISTs, 17 leiomyosarcomas, 16 melanomas, 16 schwannomas, 11 adenoid cystic carcinomas, and 8 leiomyomas.;DOG-1 was found to have 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in diagnosis of GIST. C-Kit demonstrated 70% sensitivity and 76% specificity, and PKCθ showed 40% sensitivity and 86% specificity.

This study reports an opposite finding: we have found strong evidence that the MAPK pathway is inhibited in a subset of adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) of the salivary glands. ACC tumors consistently overexpress the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) c-Kit, which has been considered a therapeutic target. We performed mutational analysis of the c-Kit gene (KIT in 17 cases of ACC and found that 2 cases of ACC had distinct missense mutations in KIT at both the genomic DNA and messenger RNA levels. These mutations caused G664R and R796G amino acid substitutions in the kinase domains. Surprisingly, the mutations were functionally inactive in cultured cells. We observed a significant reduction of MAPK (ERK1/2) activity in tumor cells, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. We performed further mutational analysis of the downstream effectors in the c-Kit pathway in the genes HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and PTEN. This analysis revealed that two ACC tumors without KIT mutations had missense mutations in either KRAS or BRAF, causing S17N K-Ras and V590I B-Raf mutants, respectively. Our functional analysis showed that proteins with these mutations were also inactive in cultured cells. This is the first time that MAPK activity from the RTK signaling has been shown to be inhibited by gene mutations during tumor development. Because ACC seems to proliferate despite inactivation of the c-Kit signaling pathway, we suggest that selective inhibition of c-Kit is probably not a suitable treatment strategy for ACC.",

There were recurrent gains at 7p15.2, 17q21-25, and 22q11-13, and recurrent losses at 1p35, 6q22-25, 8q12-13, 9p21, 12q12-13, and 17p11-13. The minimal region of gain at 7p15.2 contained the HOXA cluster. The minimal common regions of deletions contained the CDKN2A/CDKN2B, TP53, and LIMA1 tumor suppressor genes. The recurrent deletion at 8q12.3-13.1 contained no straightforward tumor suppressor gene, but the MIRN124A2 microRNA gene, whose product regulates MMP2 and CDK6. Among unique CNAs, gains harbored CCND1, KIT/PDGFRA/KDR, MDM2, and JAK2. The CNAs involving CCND1, MDM2, KIT, CDKN2A/2B, and TP53 were validated by FISH and/or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Although most tumors overexpressed cyclin D1 compared with surrounding glands, the only case to overexpress MDM2 had the corresponding CNA. In conclusion, our report suggests that ACC is characterized by a relatively low level of structural complexity. Array CGH and immunohistochemical data implicate MDM2 as the oncogene targeted at 12q15.

        "Doc_abstract":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) in the skin is very rare; only about 60 cases have been reported. Herein presented is a case of pigmented ACC arising from epidermis of the ear skin. An 85-year-old man presented black tumor of the right ear. Dermatologists' diagnosis was basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Large biopsy was obtained. The biopsy showed proliferation of atypical basaloid cells arranged in a cribriform pattern. The tumor cells were continuous with epidermis, as if it arose from the epidermis. Focal areas show melanin deposition in the tumor cells. Mucin stains showed that the tumor cells and tubular lumens contained acidic mucin. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin (CK) AE1/3, CK34BE12, CK5/6, CK7, CK14, p63, alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA), S100 protein, p53, Ki-67 (labeling 85%), KIT, PDGFRA and CD56. The tumor cells were negative for CK CAM5.2, CK8, CK18, CK19, CK20, EMA, desmin, CEA, HMB45, CD10, CD34, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin, synaptophysin, CDX2, MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC6. HMB-positive and S100-positive melanocytes were seen in a very few areas. Since characteristic cribriform pattern was recognized in the tumor and the tumor showed epithelial markers, myoepithelial markers (CD14, p63, ASMA, S100 protein) and KIT, the pathological diagnosis of ACC was made. No distant and lymph node metastasis is now seen. The patient will be treated by complete resection. The present cutaneous ACC was unique in that the ACC arose from the epidermis, had melanin pigment, and occurred in ear skin.",

A surgically resected specimen revealed that the tumor was comprised of three different components: HGA and solid-type ACC in the central portion and lower-grade ACC in the periphery. The tumor was discriminated from a dedifferentiated carcinoma or hybrid tumor. Autopsy specimens also demonstrated both solid-type ACC and HGA components in the lung and spleen.

We also compared the expression of KIT and CD5 in 20 thymic carcinomas with their expression in 20 resected pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas that were spreading directly into the mediastinum.;Of the 50 thymomas, only 2 (4%) showed positive immunoreactivity for KIT (type A thymoma, 1; type B3 thymoma, 1), whereas 16 of the 20 thymic carcinomas (80%) showed positive immunoreactivity. Testing was positive for CD5 in 14 of the 20 thymic carcinomas (70%). In the pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas, in contrast, the immunohistochemical expression of KIT and CD5 was found in only 4 of 20 carcinomas (20%) and 3 of 20 carcinomas (15%), respectively. Furthermore, of the 40 specimens examined (either thymic or lung carcinoma) all 13 that were positive for both KIT and CD5 were thymic carcinomas, and 13 of the 16 that were negative for both were lung carcinomas.;KIT expression is a useful immunohistochemical marker for the diagnosis of thymic carcinoma, and its examination in combination with CD5 immunohistochemistry would greatly help in the differential diagnosis of primary thymic carcinoma from pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma. Further investigations at a genetic level should be encouraged, not only to define the role of KIT in the oncogenesis of thymic epithelial tumors, but also to establish target-based therapy.",

The median age was 61 years (range: 32 to 72 y) with a male predominance (male to female ratio of 1.75:1). The most commonly involved sites were sinonasal (4/11) and submandibular (4/11). Lymph nodes were pathologically positive in 4/7 (57.1%) cases. Distant metastases to the lung (n=2) and soft tissue of the shoulder (n=1) were observed. Five of 9 patients (55.6%) died, all within 5 years with a median overall survival of 12 months. Histologically, ACC with high-grade transformation was distinguished from conventional ACC by nuclear enlargement and irregularity, higher mitotic counts, and the loss of the biphasic ductal-myoepithelial differentiation. Useful supportive criteria were prominent comedonecrosis and fibrocellular desmoplasia. The most common morphologies for the high-grade component were poorly differentiated cribriform adenocarcinoma and solid undifferentiated carcinoma. Micropapillary and squamoid patterns were occasionally present. Ki-67 and p53 labeling indices were elevated in the high-grade components, though c-kit and cyclin-D1 were not.

In this study we investigated c-kit expression in anaplastic and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma compared to differentiated carcinoma and adenoma and the presence of c-kit mutations. In total, 224 thyroid tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Mutation analysis of exon 9, 11, 13, and 17 of the c-kit gene was performed in anaplastic and poorly differentiated carcinoma. c-Kit expression was negative in all anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, while c-kit expression of poorly differentiated carcinoma showed a high variability with a more intense staining in tumors showing obvious differentiated malignant follicular tumor areas. Differentiated carcinoma showed a slight, but not significantly stronger c-kit expression than poorly differentiated carcinoma. All tumors revealed wild type sequences of c-kit gene in exons 9, 11, 13, and 17.

Over 90% of ACC tumors are c-kit-positive, and these primary cultures proved to be of short-term usefulness in assessing chemosensitivity. Interaction was determined over a wide range of drug combinations using a statistical three-dimensional analysis model. Both ACC short-term cultures and HNSCC cell lines were demonstrated to have a response ranging from additive to synergistic when imatinib and cisplatin were combined. The interaction of imatinib on cisplatin-induced DNA cross-linking was further investigated using the comet-X assay. In contrast, significant antagonism was observed when imatinib and gemcitabine were combined. Since gemcitabine is activated by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), the effect of imatinib on this enzyme was investigated. A dose-dependent inhibition of dCK was observed, highlighting this kinase as a possible additional secondary molecular target for imatinib.

Sixty-six cases of primary colorectal neuroendocrine carcinoma were collected from 13 institutions, including 36 small cell carcinomas and 30 moderately differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas. Immunohistochemical studies using a polyclonal antibody against c-kit protein (CD117) demonstrated a strong and diffuse cytoplasmic staining in 15 cases (23%), which were relatively equally distributed in the small cell and moderately differentiated subgroups. As controls, 25 conventional colorectal adenocarcinomas, 26 colorectal adenomas and 19 colorectal carcinoid tumors were all negative, whereas 15 gastrointestinal stromal tumors were all positive, for kit expression. In contrast to gastrointestinal stromal tumors, kit-overexpressing neuroendocrine carcinomas showed no mutations in the juxtamembrane domain (exon 11) of the c-kit gene as determined by mutational analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis with the log-rank test revealed that the patients with kit-positive tumors did not differ significantly in survival from those with kit-negative tumors (P = 0.77). These results indicate that c-kit overexpression observed in a subset of colorectal neuroendocrine carcinomas may not be mediated via activating mutations, and does not appear to be an initiating event during tumorigenesis because of lack of c-kit expression in other types of colorectal epithelial neoplasms. More importantly, our observations may have potential therapeutic implications since specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown promise in the management of patients with kit-expressing malignancies.",

Immunostaining was observed in 25% of large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. Focal staining was observed in 9% of squamous cell carcinomas and 17% of adenocarcinomas. None of the pulmonary carcinoid tumors were immunoreactive. Moderately intense immunostaining was present in 50% of localized fibrous tumors.

Lung tumors with neuroendocrine differentiation exhibited a wide spectrum of Kit immunoreactivity, ranging from rare in pulmonary carcinoid tumors to frequent in SCLC. The high frequency of Kit immunostaining in SCLC has important potential therapeutic implications. Demonstration of Kit positivity in some localized fibrous tumors in this study contrasts with absent immunoreactivity in solitary fibrous tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. The paucity of Kit staining in malignant mesothelioma suggests these tumors are unlikely to respond to currently available tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

Although largely characterized as indolent, poor outcomes have been reported in a considerable fraction of cases. As yet, optimum treatment strategies for this cancer have not been developed. This study investigates protein expression of common or potential molecular therapeutic targets and reports on the clinicopathological features of 9 new cases. We evaluated the expression of ERBB2, KIT, androgen receptor, PTEN, EGFR, ERG, and p53 via immunohistochemistry. We also examined EGFR amplification and TMPRSS2-ERG gene rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The mean clinical follow-up was 44 months. We found that basal cell carcinoma behaved aggressively with almost one-half of the cases displaying high-risk pathologic features or local recurrence (44%). One patient died as a result of metastatic disease. The most consistent abnormalities included a loss of PTEN expression (56% of cases) and EGFR overexpression (67% of cases). EGFR overexpression occurred in the absence of gene amplification. The TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement was not detected in any of the tumors studied, nor was ERG protein positivity identified by immunostaining. In addition, ERBB2, KIT, p53, and androgen receptor expressions were either absent or showed only weak, limited reactivity. Our results suggest that there is a high morbidity associated with this tumor, and more intense follow-up and additional treatment may be indicated. Furthermore, targeted therapies directed against the EGFR and PTEN proteins or their constitutive pathways may be promising for future clinical management. ",

Whether these 2 molecules are coexpressed in lung neuroendocrine tumors has not been investigated. Here, we analyzed immunohistochemical results to determine expression and coexpression patterns of c-kit and bcl-2 in the spectrum of lung neuroendocrine tumors. Using a polyclonal antibody against c-kit and a monoclonal antibody against bcl-2, our data demonstrated that all 7 cases (100%) of SCLC included in this study were positive for both c-kit and bcl-2. Among 14 LCNECs, 7 (50%) stained positive for c-kit and 9 (64%) for bcl-2. All cases of high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (SCLCs and LCNECs) that showed positive staining for c-kit coexpressed bcl-2. In contrast, all typical and atypical carcinoids (TC and AC) were negative for c-kit, and only 1 of 16 (6.3%) TCs and 1 of 6 (16.7%) ACs stained positive for bcl-2. These results indicate a progressive increase in the frequency of c-kit and bcl-2 expression and coexpression, from carcinoid tumors (TC and AC) to LCNEC and to SCLC. High grade neuroendocrine carcinomas are more likely to coexpress c-kit and bcl-2 when compared with carcinoid tumors. The high frequency of coexpression of these 2 molecules in high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung suggests that they may be involved in the carcinogenic pathway, given their important roles in carcinogenesis.

This molecular pathway seems somewhat implicated in promoting the neoplastic growth of small cell lung carcinoma. The current pharmacological availability of its selective inhibitor, together with the promising clinical results in the management of CD117-positive neoplasms such as advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors, aroused great interest among oncologists in also adopting this therapeutic strategy in other CD117-positive tumors. We evaluated a series of 27 small cell lung carcinomas, comparing the expression of CD117 of the primary naïve tumor (before first-line chemotherapy) with the expression of the same neoplasm after postchemotherapy relapse. All the patients underwent similar chemotherapeutic regimens (cisplatin/carboplatin plus etoposide). At diagnosis, 21 of 27 cases (78%) showed strong immunoreactivity for CD117. Among these 21 originally positive tumors, CD117 remained overexpressed in 10 after relapse (48%), whereas the other 11 cases became negative. No originally CD117-negative small cell carcinomas displayed immunoreactivity after chemotherapy. CD117 expression was not statistically correlated with overall survival, occurrence of chemoresistance, or clinical response to chemotherapy. We also evaluated CD117 expression in a series of 46 surgically resected non-small cell lung carcinomas (8 squamous cell carcinomas, 10 adenocarcinomas, 5 pleomorphic carcinomas, 10 typical and 3 atypical carcinoids, and 10 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas). Apart from small cell carcinomas, CD117 overexpression was observed in 6 of 10 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, whereas all the other histotypes resulted unstained. We speculate that loss of CD117 expression after chemotherapy in a high proportion of SCLC indicates that in this tumor, Kit unlikely represents the product of a constitutive mutation, as instead shown in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Keeping this finding in mind, oncologists could re-test CD117 expression in relapsing small cell lung carcinomas in order to establish the best candidates for enrollment in ongoing clinical trials with Kit inhibitors. Practically speaking, CD117 may be helpful in discriminating between pulmonary high-grade neuroendocrine tumors and other histotypes, but pathologists should be aware that treated small cell lung carcinomas may remain unstained in a not insignificant number of cases.",

In 25 (3.7%) KIT-negative GIST cases, DOG1 was expressed in 5 (20.0%) and 19 (76.0%) using DOG1.1 and K9 antibodies, respectively. Only 0.9% of GISTs were negative for KIT, DOG1.1, and K9. Most normal human tissues did not reveal KIT and DOG1 expression. DOG1.1 was positive in only 2 of 57 synovial sarcomas and 1 of 61 soft tissue leiomyosarcomas. K9 was positive in 5 of 57 synovial sarcomas, 1 of 14 angiosarcomas, 1 of 61 soft tissue leiomyosarcomas, 3 of 4 adenoid cystic carcinomas of the head and neck, and in myoepithelial cells of 9 of 11 fibroadenomas of the breast. In conclusion, the commercially available K9 is of great utility for the diagnosis of most KIT-negative GISTs, and the combination of both KIT and K9 antibody in a panel of immunohistochemistry can define the diagnosis of GIST in more than 99% of cases.",

The author investigated protein expression of KIT and PDGFRA in 54 Japanese cases of small cell lung carcinoma by immunohistochemistry, and gene mutations of KIT and PDGFRA in 20 Japanese cases of small cell lung carcinoma by the PCR-direct sequencing method. The molecular genetic analysis showed no mutations of KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17) and PDGFRA (exons 12 and 18) genes in all 20 cases. KIT protein expression was recognized in all cases (100%). Membranous KIT expression was strong in 35 cases, moderate in 7 cases and weak in 12 cases. PDGFRA protein expression was noted in 35 cases (65%); the membranous expression was strong in 2 cases, moderate in 16 cases, and weak in 17 cases. The overall median survival was 13 months. There was no significant difference in the survival between KIT strongly positive cases (median, 12 months) and KIT moderately or weakly positive cases (median, 11 months). Likewise, there was no significant difference in the survival between PDGFRA-positive cases (median, 11 months) and PDGFRA-negative cases (median, 12 months). The protein expressions of KIT and PDGFRA did not correlate with gender, smoking, and disease stage. These findings suggest, in Japanese population, that mutations of KIT and PDGFRA were absent in small cell lung carcinoma of Japan, that KIT protein expression is present in 100%, that PDGFRA expression is present in 65%, and that KIT and PDGFRA protein expressions do not correlate with survival, gender, smoking, and disease stage.",

Ovarian carcinomas frequently develop resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Immunohistochemical expression of c-ABL, PDGFR-beta, and c-KIT was evaluated in ovarian carcinomas to determine whether treatment with imatinib mesylate might be feasible.;The expression of c-ABL, c-KIT, and PDGFR-beta in tumors was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of 52 ovarian serous carcinomas, including 21 low-grade (well differentiated) and 31 high-grade (poorly differentiated) tumors. Fourteen normal ovaries were also evaluated.;In normal ovarian surface epithelium, c-ABL was expressed universally. PDGFR-beta was expressed in the majority (93%) of samples of normal ovarian epithelium, whereas the c-KIT protein was undetectable in normal ovarian surface epithelium. Overall, c-ABL was expressed in 71% of serous carcinomas. c-ABL was expressed more frequently in the low-grade serous carcinomas (81%) compared with the high-grade serous carcinomas (65%). PDGFR-beta expression was observed in 81% of serous carcinomas overall and was observed more frequently in higher-grade tumors. c-KIT immunohistochemical staining was absent in low-grade tumors but was present in 26% of high-grade serous carcinomas.;The majority of ovarian serous carcinomas express one or more of the kinases targeted by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, suggesting the potential usefulness of this drug in the treatment of ovarian carcinoma.",

An immuno-histochemical study revealed positive reaction for cytokeratin (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), KIT, PDGFRA, synapto-physin, p53 protein, and CD56, and negative reaction for chromogranin, CD45, CD20, CD3, and CD30. The Ki-67 labeling was 95%. A molecular genetic analysis showed no mutations of KIT and PDGFRA genes.

We examined KIT, EGFR, and c-erbB-2 overexpressions immunohistochemically in 150 cases of surgically resected breast cancer and their correlation with the histological type and grade and mesenchymal and/or myoepithelial immunophenotype of primary tumors. To facilitate the analysis, we constructed a tissue microarray comprising 2-mm diameter tissues cored from the representative tissue block of each tumor. KIT, EGFR, and c-erbB-2 overexpressions were detected in 15 (10%), 12 (8%), and 23 (15%), respectively. The KIT was more frequent in the group comprising comedo-type ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs) of the solid-tubular subtype than in the group of other histological types (P=0.027), and the EGFR was more frequent in IDCs of solid-tubular type than in other histological types (P <0.05). KIT and EGFR overexpressions were correlated with nuclear grade 3 (P=0.0095 and 0.0005) and tended to be concurrent (P=0.005). KIT overexpression was correlated with vimentin and S-100 expression (P=0.003 and P=0.005), and EGFR overexpression was correlated with S100 expression (P=0.0001).

We investigated the expression of KIT and stem cell factor (SCF) in CRC in comparison with premalignant colon lesions and normal colonic mucosa to assess the prognostic and therapeutic relevance of this receptor/ligand system in CRC. Transcript levels of c-kit and the two SCF splicing variants were determined quantitatively by real-time RT-PCR using cDNA obtained from normal, premalignant and malignant snap frozen colon tissue specimens. Immunohistochemistry with specific anti-KIT and anti-SCF antibodies was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections in order to localize the relative protein expression in epithelial compartments. Approximately 10% of patients expressed KIT in their adenoma or primary tumor. The majority of KIT-positive carcinomas co-expressed SCF. Real-time RT-PCR showed expression of c-kit and SCF transcripts in all cDNA specimens examined. A significant association between the co-expression of KIT/SCF and a worse clinical outcome was found. In conclusion, KIT expression was observed in a proportion of premalignant and malignant colonic lesions, while it was virtually absent in normal colon mucosa. Moreover, the majority of KIT-positive carcinomas co-expressed SCF, suggesting the possibility of aberrant signaling by an autocrine loop, as confirmed by the negative prognostic value of this association. Therefore, in the subset of CRC patients with concomitant KIT/SCF expression, the activity of Imatinib mesylate, a selective inhibitor of specific tyrosine kinases including KIT, may be exploited in combination with standard therapy.",

Few studies had investigated c-KIT, but not DOG-1, expression in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). This study aims to investigate expressions of c-KIT and DOG-1 in colorectal mucinous carcinoma and nonmucinous carcinoma using manual tissue microarray technique. In this work, we studied tumor tissue specimens from 150 patients with colorectal mucinous (MA) and nonmucinous adenocarcinoma (NMA). High-density manual tissue microarrays were constructed using modified mechanical pencil tip technique, and immunohistochemistry for c-KIT and DOG-1 was done. We found that aberrant c-KIT expression was detected in 12 cases (8%); 6 cases (4%) showed strong expression. Aberrant DOG-1 expression was detected in 15 cases (10%); among them, only 4 cases (2.7%) showed strong expression. Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma showed a significantly high expression of c-KIT, but not DOG-1, than MA. Aberrant c-KIT and DOG-1 expressions were significantly unrelated but were associated with excessive microscopic abscess formation. Neither c-KIT nor DOG-1 expression showed a significant impact on disease-free survival or overall survival. In conclusion, aberrant c-KIT and DOG-1 expressions in CRC are rare events, either in NMA or MA. Nonmucinous adenocarcinoma showed a significantly higher expression of c-KIT, but not DOG-1, than MA. The expressions of both in CRC are significantly unrelated but are associated with microscopic abscess formation. Neither c-KIT nor DOG-1 expression showed a significant impact on disease-free survival or overall survival.

Gene copy number, mRNA expression levels, and protein expression were assayed using array-based comparative genomic hybridization, real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. For validation, we investigated copy number alterations and mRNA expression in external microarray data sets of 1,600 and 555 primary lung tumors, respectively. Positivity for KIT staining was most common in large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) which also showed the highest KIT mRNA expression levels whereas expression was lowest in squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC). KIT mRNA expression levels were higher in KIT immunopositive samples, but expression was not affected by KIT copy numbers. Copy number gains of KIT were significantly more frequent in SqCC compared with adenocarcinoma in our own series and in the 1,600-sample data set. Immunopositivity for both KIT and KITLG in the same tumor was rare except in LCNEC.

Other types of carcinomas such as adenocarcinoma (AC) and small cell carcinoma (SmCC) can occur in UB carcinomas. Expression of KIT and PDGFRA has not been reported. A 66-year-old man admitted to our hospital because of hematuria. Cystoscopy revealed papillary invasive tumor and a transurethral bladder tumorectomy (TUR-BT) was performed. The TUR-BT showed UC, AC, SmCC, large cell carcinoma (LCC), and pleomorphic carcinoma (PC). The UC component showed plasmacytoid, spindle, nested, clear cell, acantholytic variants. The AC element showed tubular adenocarcinoma and signet-ring cell carcinoma (Sig). Immunohistochemically, all of these subtypes were positive for cytokeratin (CK) AE1/3, CK CAM5.2, CK34BE12, CK5, CK6, CK7, CK8, CK18, CK19, CK20, EMA, CEA, p63, CA19-9, p53 (positive 45%), MUC1, NSE, NCAM, KIT, PDGFRA, and Ki-67 (87%).

Mucin histochemistry revealed mucins in AC element including Sig. A molecular genetic analysis using PCR-direct sequencing method identified no mutations of KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17) and PDGFRA (exons 12 and 18) genes. The carcinoma was highly aggressive and invaded into muscular layer. The nuclear grade was very high, and there were numerous lymphovascular permeations were seen. The surface showed carcinoma in situ involving von-Brunn's nests.

These effects are performed by activation of the SCF receptor, c-kit. Because of the potential use of SCF in patients undergoing chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, the effect of SCF on nonhematopoietic tumors requires investigation. To determine whether human tumor cell lines display c-kit receptors, we performed binding experiments with 125I-SCF on a breast carcinoma cell line (Du4475), a gastric carcinoma cell line (KATO III), a melanoma cell line (HTT144), as well as two small cell lung carcinoma cell lines (H69 and H128). The biologic effect of SCF on tumor cell lines was assessed by its ability to stimulate tritiated thymidine uptake and to enhance colony growth in methylcellulose. The breast carcinoma cell line, Du4475, as well as two small cell lung carcinoma cell lines, H69 and H128, exhibit high-affinity c-kit receptors with approximate binding affinities of 40, 100, and 90 pmol/L, respectively. The number of high-affinity receptors per cell ranged from 700 to 9,500. The gastric carcinoma cell line, as well as the melanoma cell line, showed trace binding of 125I-SCF. In the presence of SCF alone, or in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or interleukin-3, there was less than a 17% increase in the colony growth of Du4475, H69, or H128 cell lines. Postulating that the lack of growth response could be secondary to endogenous SCF production by the tumor cell lines, we used an RNAse protection assay to determine whether the tumor cell lines contain SCF messenger RNA (mRNA). In addition, we tested tumor cell line supernatants for the presence of secreted SCF protein by enzyme immunoassay, and analyzed the tumor cell lines for membrane-bound SCF by indirect immunofluorescence. Our results show that the Du4475, H69, and H128 cell lines, as well as a melanoma cell line (HTT144), have multiple copies of SCF mRNA. Soluble SCF protein was detected in the cell supernatants in the Du4475 and H69 cell lines and SCF was found on the surface of all four cell lines. These data show that some human solid tumor cell lines display high-affinity c-kit receptors and produce SCF, which can be detected on the cell surface. These results suggest the possibility that autocrine production of SCF by c-kit receptor-bearing tumor cells may enhance cell growth in tumor cell lines.",

To our knowledge there are no published studies on c-KIT and squamous cell carcinomas of the vulva (VSCC). Although there are a significant number of other tumor types which express c-KIT, there remains controversy as to its relationship to patient outcome. Thus, we wished to investigate such controversial findings to determine the prognostic importance of c-KIT by evaluating its protein and mRNA expression in VSCCs, correlating these findings with clinicopathological features and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection.;c-KIT expression was scored by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as positive or negative in 139 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cases of vulvar carcinomas arrayed in a tissue microarray (TMA) using the DAKO A4502 rabbit polyclonal c-KIT antibody (diluted 1:100). c-KIT mRNA was evaluated by qRT-PCR in 34 frozen samples from AC Camargo Hospital Biobank (17 tumoral and 17 non-tumoral samples) using TaqMan probes-Applied Biosystems [Hs00174029_m1]. HPV genotyping was assessed in 103 samples using Linear Array® HPV Genotyping Test kit (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). All results obtained were correlated with clinical and pathological data of the patients.;c-KIT protein was positive by immunohistochemistry in 70.5% of the cases and this was associated with a higher global survival (p = 0.007), a higher recurrence-free survival (p < 0.0001), an absence of associated lesions (p = 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0053), and HPV infection (p = 0.034). Furthermore, c-KIT mRNA quantitation revealed higher levels of transcripts in normal samples compared to tumor samples (p = 0,0009).;Our findings indicate that those vulvar tumors staining positively for c-KIT present better prognosis. Thus, positivity of c-KIT as evaluated by IHC may be a good predictor for use of more conservative surgery techniques and lymph node dissection in vulvar cancer. So part of the essence of our study is to see the possibility of translating our current results from the bench to the bedside. This will help provide patients a more appropriate, less mutilating treatment, in order to keep the maximum physical and psychic quality as possible to these women.",

We analyzed 65 archival tissues immunohistologically. EGFR and/or c-kit were expressed in 55% of basal-like tumors. Expression of EGFR and/or c-kit was strongly associated with high histologic grade (P=0.001), high nuclear grade (P=0.017), high mitotic counts (P=0.002), ER negativity (P=0.003), PR negativity (P=0.007), and HER2 negativity (P=0.014). EGFR and/or c-kit positive tumors were more likely to express the BLP (OR 9.1, CI 2.6-32.0, P<0.0005) than the negative tumors.

In this study, CIS and overtly invasive human male germ cell tumours were analysed immunohistochemically for expression of the c-kit proto-oncogene protein product. Testicular tissue samples from 36 patients with various types of testicular germ cell neoplasia and 19 control specimens were stained using an indirect immunoperoxidase method. High expression of c-kit was found in almost all cases of CIS, both when the lesion was the only pathology, and when CIS was adjacent to invasive tumours. The Kit staining was retained in seminomas with variable intensity; the majority of cells in tumour mass exhibited c-kit expression in 61% of the samples while focal expression was observed in 39% of the samples studied. No expression of c-kit was detected in non-seminomas or in normal testicular germ cells. High expression of the proto-oncogene in CIS cells supports the hypothesis of their origin from primordial germ cells.

This study was performed to determine whether data derived from its use were comparable to published S-phase data from the use of thymidine labeling, BRDU, or other methods on breast carcinomas. Primary infiltrating ductal carcinomas (n = 142) and primary lobular carcinomas (n = 6) showed mean and median BRDU labeling of 4.63% and 3%, 1.3% and 1%, respectively, with a range of 0-28%. Benign lesions always had less than 3% BRDU uptake (n = 21). Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status correlated with BRDU labeling (P less than 0.05), with the highest S-phase fractions in ER- and PR-negative tumors. Correlations between BRDU uptake and histologic tumor type or size were observed. Significant correlations between BRDU uptake and lymph node status, patient age, or histologic tumor grade were not observed.

Patients with tumours expressing c-kit tend to exhibit better survival, but a paracrine/autocrine function for the stem cell factor (SCF)/c-kit system in nasopharyngeal carcinomas has not been reported. This study evaluated the expression of c-kit and SCF by immunohistochemical staining of nasopharyngeal epithelium (NPE) and of primary and metastatic NPCs. In addition, c-kit and SCF expression were studied in HONE-1 NPC cells by immunoprecipitation and western blotting. Expression of c-kit and SCF was detected in 75% and 57% of NPE, respectively, and there was 48% co-expression. In primary NPCs, 86% expressed c-kit, 69% had SCF expression, and there was 67% co-expression. In metastatic NPCs, 76% expressed c-kit, 72% expressed SCF and there was 68% co-expression. Co-expression of c-kit and SCF with tyrosine autophosphorylation of p145(c - kit) was demonstrated in HONE-1 NPC cells. In addition, the expression level of c-kit and its autophosphorylation status was not obviously influenced by the transient co-expression of Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). Co-expression of c-kit and SCF is therefore commonly found in nasopharyngeal epithelium and NPCs, and in HONE-1 NPC cells with autoactivation possibly independent of the co-expression of EBNA1 and LMP1. All of these findings suggest that autoactivation of SCF/c-kit signalling may be a potent regulator of the nasopharyngeal epithelial barrier and of immune function at the nasopharyngeal mucosa surface, and may contribute to the carcinogenesis and progression of NPC. Further molecular analysis is required to evaluate the possibility of treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in NPC, analogous to the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours with STI571.",

The author herein reports a very rare case of primary small cell carcinoma of the maxillary sinus with an emphasis on immunohistochemistry and on KIT and PDGFRA. A 64-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of left nasal obstruction. Endoscopy revealed three nasal polyps, and imaging modalities revealed an infiltrative tumor (45 x 45 mm) in the left maxillary sinus with invasion into nasal cavity. Multiple biopsies are taken from the nasal lesions. Histologically, the tumor consists of proliferation of malignant small epithelioid cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, fine chromatin, scant cytoplasm, molded nuclei, and absent nucleoli. Immunohistochemically, the malignant cells were positive for cytokeratin (CK) 18, synaptophysin, CD56, p53, Ki-67 (labeling=95%), bcl-2, KIT, and PDGFRA. However, they were negative for pancytokeratins, high molecular weight CK, CK5/6, CK7, CK 14, CK 19, CK20, vimentin, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin, CD15, CD45, S100 protein, CEA, CA19-9, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilaments, neuroblastoma, CD99, surfactant apoprotein A, melanosome, and TTF-1. The pathologic diagnosis was small cell carcinoma. A molecular genetic analysis using PCR-direct sequencing was performed using paraffin sections, and it showed no mutations of KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17) and PDGFRA (exons 12 and 18) genes. Imaging modalities including CT, MRI and PET did not reveal any tumors, including the lung, other than the maxillary sinus tumor. The present case is the first of small cell carcinoma of the maxillary sinus with a comprehensive immunohistochemical examination and a gene analysis of KIT and PDGFRA.",

Indeed this tyrosine kinase receptor, besides being essential for the survival and proliferation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) and for postnatal spermatogenesis and oogenesis, is also frequently overexpressed or constitutively active due to activating mutations in carcinoma in situ of the testis and in seminomas. In this review, I will summarize available data about the transcriptional mechanisms involved in the control of Kit expression in the germline. Variable mechanisms, involving different germ cell-specific transcription factors, are operating in the various developmental stages: SOX2 and SOHLH1/2 act as direct positive regulators in PGCs and in postnatal spermatogonia, respectively, whereas PLZF suppresses KIT expression in spermatogonial stem cells. DMRT1, acting through indirect mechanisms, suppresses KIT transcription in fetal gonocytes, while activating it in differentiating spermatogonia.",

The assay procedure is simple and based on the one-step IRMA system. There were no problems in reproducibility, dilution test and recovery test. The minimum detectable dose was 0.3 ng/ml. The antigen measured by this kit was immunologically cross-reactive with tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA) and CYFRA 21-1 concentration was closely correlated with TPA concentration in the patient's serum (r = 0.86, p < 0.01). The cut-off value of serum CYFRA 21-1 based on the assay results of this kit was calculated to be 1.6 ng/ml from the receiver operating characteristic curve. Three of 47 healthy subjects (6.4%) and 9 of 30 patients with benign lung diseases (30.0%) showed a concentration over the cut-off value. By contrast, serum CYFRA 21-1 concentration was elevated in 31 of 50 patients with lung cancer (62.0%), 11 of 13 squamous cell carcinoma patients (84.6%), 8 of 12 small cell carcinoma patients (66.7%), 4 of 7 large cell carcinoma patients (57.1%) and 8 of 18 adenocarcinoma patients (44.4%).

Twenty-one of the 25 (84%) primary tumors stained positively for KIT, of which 14 (67%) showed widespread positivity. Five of the 6 lymph nodes (83%) were similarly positive. High mitotic rate and vascular invasion in the primary tumors tended to be associated with prominent staining in the lymph node metastases. No association was found between c-kit expression and outcome. We confirm that the majority of primary MCCs express c-kit and further find that metastases are positive for the KIT receptor as well.

The most common mutation of c-Kit in these disorders is a substitution of the aspartic acid residue in position 816 to a valine (D816V), leading to constitutive activation of the receptor. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of Src family kinases in c-Kit/D816V signaling. Src family kinases are necessary for the phosphorylation of wild-type c-Kit as well as of activation of downstream signaling pathways including receptor ubiquitination and the Ras/Mek/Erk pathway. Our data demonstrate that, unlike wild-type c-Kit, the phosphorylation of c-Kit/D816V is not dependent on Src family kinases. In addition, we found that neither receptor ubiquitination nor Erk activation by c-Kit/D816V required activation of Src family kinases. In vitro kinase assay using synthetic peptides revealed that c-Kit/D816V had an altered substrate specificity resembling Src and Abl tyrosine kinases. We further present evidence that, in contrast to wild-type c-Kit, Src family kinases are dispensable for c-Kit/D816V cell survival, proliferation, and colony formation. Taken together, we demonstrate that the signal transduction pathways mediated by c-Kit/D816V are markedly different from those activated by wild-type c-Kit and that altered substrate specificity of c-Kit circumvents a need for Src family kinases in signaling of growth and survival, thereby contributing to the transforming potential of c-Kit/D816V.",

Significantly, c-kit strongly promoted tumor cell invasiveness by increasing ETV4, which induced MMP7 expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via ERK pathway. In vitro up- or down-regulating c-kit activation in human colorectal cancer HCT-116 cells further consolidated these results. In conclusion, our data suggested that the c-kit signaling obviously promoted proliferation and invasion of CRMAC. Therefore, targeting the c-kit signaling and its downstream molecules might provide the potential strategies for treatment of patients suffering from CRMAC in the future. ",

Therefore, adenotonsillectomy is an efficient method for reducing the number and severity of subsequent infections.;This study aimed to determine the Chlamydophila pneumonia infection by serological tests and performing PCR in the adenoid tissue, in children undergoing adenoid surgery and compare the results with normal children.;This case control study was conducted in the ENT and pediatric wards of Rasoul Akram Hospital in Tehran (2008-2011). We studied 53 patients who had undergone the adenoid surgery (adenoid hypertrophy concomitant with rhino sinusitis) and 31 other patients undergoing elective surgeries in the general surgery ward (like orthopedic surgeries, hernia, etc.) without any infection (like rhinosinusitis), as the control groups. We searched for C. pneumoniae by PCR kits (Chemicon, Germany) in resected adenoid tissues and nasopharyngeal swabs of controls (ethics restrictions in controls). We also looked for specific IgM & IgG antibodies (ELISA, Biochem Immuno Systems, Italy) and compared them between the two groups. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.;Positive PCR results were observed in 13.5% of cases and none of the controls. The condition prevalence was higher in warm seasons (P = 0.05). No correlation was found between positive PCR results and patients' gender. IgM presence was observed in 11% (6.51) of cases and 6.5% (2.31) of controls (P = 0.7). IgG results were not positive in any of the cases (0.51), whereas positive results were seen in 13.3% of the controls (P = 0.007). IgM results showed no significant difference with PCR results (P = 0.7) but IgG results did (P = 0.05).;The results of the study showed a positive correlation between PCR and serology (IgM) results in the case group. Recent C. pneumoniae infection was proved to exist by PCR and serology (IgM) in patients who had undergone adenoidectomy. In contrast to the controls, none of the patients in the study group showed previous immunity. Findings indicate the probable role of C. pneumoniae infection, in inducing adenoid hypertrophy in nearly 13% of cases.",

This study included 72 pancreatic IDC patients who received a pancreatectomy between 1982 and 2002. The expression of c-KIT was analyzed retrospectively by immunohistochemistry. c-KIT was expressed in 78% (56/72) of the pancreatic IDCs. c-KIT expression did not correlate with any clinicopathological factor of pancreatic IDC and c-KIT expression had no significant influence on the survival of the patients. The survival rate of the adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) (+) group was significantly higher than that of the ACT (-) group, but c-KIT expression had no significant effects on the efficacy of the ACT. Multivariate analysis indicated that the pTNM stage, grade and ACT were all significant variables for survival in IDCs overall. As c-KIT was expressed in 78% of the pancreatic IDCs, it suggests that STI571 may be a beneficial agent for chemotherapy against human pancreatic IDCs.",

Our experience has been that a small number of MCCs (12.5%) are positive for KIT by IHC. We also found a higher rate of apparently KIT-positive MCCs (75%) using heat-induced epitope retrieval. Our anecdotal experience with the use of imatinib mesylate has been disappointing. As IHC detection of KIT expression does not correlate with the presence of KIT-activating mutations, protein expression as tested by IHC should not be used to determine if patients would respond to imatinib mesylate.

The rat Mab was biotinylated and attached to Dynabeads via streptavidin and a DNA linker. The anti-epithelial monoclonal mouse antibody Ber-EP4 was used as the primary capture antibody. In order to permit phenotyping of the isolated carcinoma cells the magnetic beads were removed from the carcinoma cells by DN'ase digestion of the DNA linker between the magnetic bead and the secondary antibody. In an ex vivo model system an average recovery of approximately 60% of a human colon carcinoma cell line HCC-2998 seeded in 5.10(6) PBMCs was obtained, and the recovered cells could subsequently be immunologically stained for the surface antigen CD87 (urokinase plasminogen activator receptor). No positive stained cells were found in control experiments with PBMCs without carcinoma cells. Despite a relatively low recovery, the described method will be valuable for the detection of carcinoma cells in cytospin preparations with subsequent phenotyping of the cells for expression of surface antigens. Depending on the chosen antibodies, the method may be useful for the isolation and characterisation of other cell types in various cell suspensions.",

Thus, selective inhibition of LPC growth during preneoplastic injury may prevent or delay the onset of liver cancer.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the c-kit inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM) would suppress LPC growth and, therefore, may exert antitumorigenic effects in the liver.;Expression of IM target proteins was examined in chronically injured rodent and human livers. The effect of IM was examined in vitro using LPC lines and in vivo in mice fed a choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet. Livers were examined following short-term (up to 1 month) or long-term (up to 14 months) feeding of CDE diet and drug treatments.;C-kit was significantly up-regulated in chronic injury and expressed by LPCs. IM was antiproliferative to LPC lines, and knockdown of c-kit reduced this response. IM treatment inhibited the LPCs response and early fibrogenesis induced by a short-term CDE diet. On the longer term, IM treatment reduced the extent of fibrosis and significantly inhibited tumor formation.;Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as IM, may be suited for the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma in the setting of chronic liver injury via antiproliferative effects on c-kit-expressing LPCs.",

The kit distinguishes between homozygotes and heterozygotes for deltaF508, but not for rare mutations. The kit detects from 68 to 92% of defective alleles in Caucasians. We evaluate the kit in a blind study in two independent laboratories. Thirty blood samples and thirty mouthwash samples from CF patients, carriers and unaffected individuals were analysed by the Elucigene CF20 kit. All the samples were previously analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The Elucigene CF20 kit consists of three multiplexes. Each mutiplex contains ARMS specific primers for six to eight mutations and two control reactions. The absence of the upper control fragment indicates that a repeat test is required. We demonstrated a first time amplification rate of 98.3%: of the 60 samples tested, one required a reamplification. Results compared with the reference method demonstrated that in all cases where one or more of the 20 mutations detected by the kit were present in the test set, the kit accurately identified them. Reproducibility was assessed by repeating the analysis of a blood and mouthwash sample five times. Cross reactivity between R117C and R117H, R117P and R117H, R347P and R347H, deltaI507 and deltaF508, G551D and R553X were evaluated. Only a cross reactivity between R347P and R347H was observed.

Our previous study demonstrated that the origin of mature cystic teratoma of the uterus is not related to the parthenogenetic process, but is most likely pluripotential stem cell or primordial germ cell before meiosis I. Further studies are needed to clarify the origin of benign mature cystic teratomas of the ovary in Taiwan. In the present study, we investigated the DNA profiles of 9 mature cystic teratomas of the ovary using short tandem repeat analysis with AmpFLSTR SGM Plus, Profiler PCR amplification kits. The methylation statuses of the HhaI sites in the SNRPN, H19DMR, and KvDMR regions were determined on methylation-sensitive multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis. DNA profiling data from the 9 mature cystic teratomas of the ovary excluded parthenogenetic origin, as most of the 15 short tandem repeat loci were heterozygous on genotyping. There were varying degrees of hypermethylation of SNRPN gene and KvDMR locus in the presence of maternal uniparental disomy in all 9 mature cystic teratomas of the ovary. In light of these results, we further postulated that the origin of these mature cystic teratomas of the ovary is oogonia or primary oocyte before germinal vesicle stage failure of meiosis I. ",

The normal group was fed with standard forage while the rest two groups were fed with 3'-methyl-2-methylamino-azobenzene (DAB) to induce carcinoma for 14 weeks and then fed with standard forage and water. Uscharidin was injected abdominally to the intervention group from the first week to the 14th week. All rats were killed and biopsy specimens were taken from the left and right liver lobes for immunohistochemical staining of c-kit and PCNA on the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 20th, 22nd, and 24th week.;From the 2nd to 14th week after liver infection, c-kit positive cells, mainly oval cells were found in the portal area in the carcinoma-induction group and dotted positive pigmentations in liver lobules. In the 22nd week, a large number of cancerous nodes occurred and nuclei heteromorphism was apparent; the number of positive cell decreased but positive cells could be sparsely observed in cancerous nodes. In the 2nd week of the carcinoma-induction process, PCNA positive cells were oval cells in the portal area. In the 4th week, a lot of hepatic cells were positively stained, especially in the central vein area. In the 6th week, PCNA positive cells could be seen in the lobules of the liver. In the 8th week, the number of PCNA cells decreased comparatively. From the 10th to 14th week, oval cells in the portal area were still over-expressed. From the 16th to 24th week, a large number of cancerous nodes occurred and PCNA was over-expressed in some of them. In necrotic cancerous nodes, the para-cancerous PCNA positive cells were sparsely distributed and their number was less than that of PCNA positive cells of cancerous tissues.;Hepatic stem cells originating from the terminal biliary plexus of the portal area are involved in the development of hepatocarcinoma because c-kit positive cells expressed in cancerous nodes, accompany the whole process of the development. In the middle inflammatory period of carcinoma-induction, the expression of PCNA in hepatic cells peaked, but the index decreased in the late inflammatory period and in the proliferated fibrosis stage. The expression of PCNA is a tortuous process, going up, down, then up again from normal tissues to cancerous tissues. Combined with pathological findings, PCNA can be considered as a warning index for carcinomatous cells.",

Imaging studies disclosed an oval to round superotemporal mass in the right lacrimal fossa without bone erosion. Excisional biopsy revealed a pseudoencapsulated, bosselated tumor with a spindled, hypocellular and heavily PAS-positive stroma constituted by abundant basement membrane material and collagen. Scattered lumens and focal cribriform cellular clusters were present in the peripheries of several of the lobules. Immunohistochemistry showed epithelial membrane antigen+ and cytokeratin (CK) 7+ in many small lumenal structures. The spindled cells were calponin+, CK5/6+, CK14+, and p63+, confirming their myoepithelial nature. The Ki67 proliferation index was 2-3% and upregulation of nuclear p53, a tumor suppressor gene product which may be aberrantly over-expressed in malignancy, was observed in rare cells. Immunohistochemical probes for HMGA2 and PLAG1 oncoproteins, characteristic of pleomorphic adenoma, were stained intensely and less intensely, respectively. MYB and c-KIT (CD117) were negative, thereby strongly arguing against the diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma. In atypical epithelial tumors of the lacrimal gland, genetic probes identifying distinctive gene translocations or their oncoprotein products complement traditional immunohistochemical biomarkers such as cytokeratins and other structural or secretory molecules.

        "Doc_abstract":"Microglandular adenosis (MGA) of the breast is widely known as a benign lesion that can mimic invasive carcinoma. In situ and invasive carcinomas have been described as arising in MGA, but which cases of MGA will progress to carcinoma is unclear. Criteria for distinguishing uncomplicated MGA, MGA with atypia (AMGA), and carcinoma arising in MGA (MGACA) are not standardized. The primary objective of this study was to illustrate the clinical, histopathologic, and immunophenotypical characteristics of MGA, AMGA, and MGACA in an effort to provide criteria for distinguishing the 3 types. We retrospectively identified 108 cases seen at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1983 and 2007 that had a diagnosis of MGA. Of the 108 cases, 65 cases had available material for review. Inclusion criteria were glands of MGA expressing S-100 protein and lacking myoepithelial layer (smooth muscle actin negative). Eleven out of 65 cases qualified to have an MGA component; myoepithelial layer was detected in the remaining 54 cases and were classified as adenosis. Out of the 11 MGA patients, there were 3 patients with uncomplicated MGA, 2 had AMGA, and 6 had MGACA. Staining indices for the cell cycle markers p53 and Ki-67 were used to compare the 3 tumor categories. Additional staining for other tumor markers [estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-kit, CK5/6, and CK18] were performed. Patient demographics, tumor radiologic features, and clinical follow-up data were collected for all cases. Multiple invasive histologic components were identified in each of the MGACA cases. All invasive MGACAs had a duct-forming component. In addition, basal-like component was present in 2 cases, aciniclike in 2, matrix producing in 4, sarcomatoid in 1, and adenoid cystic in 1. All tumors had strong and diffuse CK8/18 and EGFR expression but no estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2 (ie, triple negative), or CK5/6 expression. C-kit was focally expressed in 2 of the MGACAs. Ki-67 and p53 labeling indices was < 3% in all MGAs, 5% to 10% in the AMGAs, and > 30% in MGACAs. In a follow-up ranging from 14 days to 8 years, none of the MGA cases recurred. One of the AMGA cases recurred as invasive carcinoma in a background of AMGA after 8 years following incomplete excision of the lesion. Three out of 6 MGACA cases (50%) required multiple consecutive resections ending up with mastectomy due to involved margins by invasive or in situ carcinoma. Two out of 6 MGACA cases (34%) developed metastasis and died of disease. Our data showed that Ki-67 and p53 expression, in conjunction with the morphologic features, could be a reliable marker to distinguish MGA from AMGA and MGACA. Although 11 tumors were only included in our study, 64% of the tumors were carcinomas arising in MGA. This high incidence of MGACA may not represent the actual frequency of MGAs progressing into carcinoma and is likely due to referral bias in our institution. Nonetheless, the high association of carcinoma with MGA necessitates complete excision of MGA to rule out invasion. Although all the MGACA cases were triple negative and express EGFR (basal-like features), all the cases in our study showed a luminal type of differentiation by CK8/18 expression, indicating that MGACA may not fit well into the current proposed molecular classification of breast cancer.",

In most cases, gain of KIT did not include the immediately flanking noncoding DNA or the flanking genes KDR and PDGFRA. Increased copy number of KIT was not found in the putative precursor lesion, carcinoma in situ (CIS), adjacent to tumor with this change. KIT overexpression was found independent of gain and KIT immunostaining was stronger in selected cases with gain of KIT compared to those without. Taken together with activating mutations of KIT in exon 17 identified in 13% of seminomas, this suggests that the KIT gene product plays a role in the progression of CIS towards seminoma, the further understanding of which may lead to novel less toxic therapeutic approaches.",

The serum levels of CA 19-9 not only reflect the pulmonary condition of CF patients but also respond well to antibiotic therapy. Several lines of evidence suggest that the elevated serum concentration of CA 19-9 is derived from sputum and corresponds with the amount of sputum in the lung. Correlations between CA 19-9 and CA 195 in random and serial specimens from both patients with CF and patients with pancreatic carcinoma suggest that all sera contain heterogeneous, Lewis blood group-related epitopes and the proportions of various epitopes are different among individual patients. When monitored on multiple tumor markers, the pattern of CF is different from that of pancreatic carcinoma although both usually show elevated CA 19-9.

Case 1 was a combined squamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma, and case 2 was a combined squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and small cell carcinoma. Case 1 was a 67-year-old man with complaints of dysphagia. Endoscopic examination revealed an ulcerated tumor in the middle esophagus, and 6 biopsies were obtained. All 6 biopsies revealed a mixture of squamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma. Both elements were positive for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and p53 protein, and had high Ki-67 labeling. The small cell carcinoma element was positive for synaptophysin, CD56, KIT, and platelet-derived growth factor-α (PDGFRA), while the squamous cell carcinoma element was not. Genetically, no mutations of KIT and PDGFRA were recognized. The patient died of systemic carcinomatosis 15 mo after presentation. Case 2 was a 74-year-old man presenting with dysplasia. Endoscopy revealed a polypoid tumor in the distal esophagus. Seven biopsies were taken, and 6 showed a mixture of squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma. The 3 elements were positive for cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen, and p53 protein, and had high Ki-67 labeling. The adenocarcinoma element was positive for mucins. The small cell carcinoma element was positive for CD56, synaptophysin, KIT, and PDGFRA, but the other elements were not. Mutations of KIT and PDGFRA were not recognized. The patient died of systemic carcinomatosis 7 mo after presentation. These combined carcinomas may arise from enterochromaffin cells or totipotential stem cell in the esophagus or transdifferentiation of one element to another.

Taking cytological results as gold standard, it was found that HCII was more sensitive (36.4%) than DR. HPV Chip Kit (18.2%) although specificity was 100% with the latter method. In addition, both these molecular methods had comparable negative and positive predictive values. It was concluded that both HCII and DR. HPV Chip Kit have comparable specificity.

The response of VEGF to endothelial cell mitogenesis and survival, as well as angiogenesis and microvascular permeability, is mainly mediated through its receptor-2, VEGFR2 (kinase domain receptor or fetal liver kinase-1, KDR or Flk-1). This study aimed to detect the expression of VEGFR2 in various forms of thyroid tumors. In addition, the expression of Flk-2 (receptor for Flt-3) and c-Kit (receptor for steel locus factor), which shows strong similarity to Flk-1, was also examined in thyroid tumors.;RT-PCR analyses of c-Kit and immunohistochemical staining of c-Kit, Flk-1, and Flk-2 were performed in archived samples of 18 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 9 follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), 12 follicular adenoma (FA), and 7 nodular goiter (NG) samples. The data were correlated to clinicopathologic features.;By RT-PCR analyses, c-Kit expression was detected in 22% (4/18) of PTC, 22% (2/9) of FTC, 25% (3/12) of FA, and 57% (4/7) of NG samples. However, positive immunostaining signals of c-Kit were only observed in 17% (3/18) of PTC samples, and not in the others. Similarly, Flk-1 expression was only detected by immunohistochemistry in 67% (12/18) of PTC and 43% (3/7) of NG samples, and not in the others. Interestingly, the expression of Flk-2 was found in 89% (16/18) of PTC, 89% (8/9) of FTC, 75% (9/12) of FA, and 29% (2/7) of NG samples. An inverse relationship of thyroid cancer size with Flk-2 expression was found.;Flk-2 expression was detected in various forms of thyroid tumors and increased Flk-2 expression was correlated with thyroid tumors with increased transforming activity, suggesting that Flk-2 is involved in pathogenic development of thyroid malignancy. Similarly, Flk-1 expression was also found in some thyroid tumors, while the expression of c-Kit-mediated pathways may not play a major role in thyroid tumorigenesis.",

We identified 118 patients with high-grade advanced stage OSC from our files. Clinical data, including demographics and overall survival, were collected. Immunohistochemical panel consisting of c-kit, ki-67, p53, and bcl-2 was performed. C-kit was categorized as positive if any cytoplasmic or membranous staining pattern was identified. Correlation between c-kit expression and the other markers was performed. Survival analysis was performed using COX proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier test. Of 118 cases, 25 (21.2%) expressed c-kit. Of 93 c-kit-negative tumors, 87.1% had a high proliferation index. High p53 and bcl-2 expression was identified in 96 (81.4%) and 59 (50%) cases respectively. No significant statistical correlation was identified between c-kit and apoptosis markers. Tumors lacking c-kit expression showed a trend toward having high proliferation index, but this did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.07). Of the seven variables included in the multivariate survival analysis, only c-kit (odds ratio, 2.12; 95% confidence interval, 08-4.17; p = 0.02) and ki-67 (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.1; p = 0.03) showed an independent statistically significant impact on survival.

A total of 72 children were studied: 27 who were healthy, 22 with cystic fibrosis and 23 with non-pancreatic disorders. Oral pancreatic extracts were not discontinued in the children with cystic fibrosis. A small sample of faeces was collected from each subject for elastase 1 concentration and chymotrypsin activity determination. In all of the healthy children and most of those with non-pancreatic disorders (20/23), elastase 1 concentrations were greater than 500 microg/g; in contrast, the vast majority (20/22) of children with cystic fibrosis had very low values (less than 20 microg/g). The differences between children with cystic fibrosis and the other two groups were highly significant (P < 0.001). With a cut-off level of 132 microg/g, the sensitivity and specificity of faecal elastase 1 for the determination of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency were 96% and 100%, respectively. The specificity of faecal chymotrypsin was 96%, but its sensitivity was not calculated since the children with cystic fibrosis continued to take pancreatic extracts during the study.;The determination of faecal elastase 1 concentration is a simple and reliable means of assessing exocrine pancreatic function in children with cystic fibrosis.

Three hundred eight serum samples from 158 patients with aspergillosis sensu lato (s.l.) were analyzed. More specifically, 267 serum samples were derived from patients with Aspergillus disease, including 89 cases of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, 10 of aspergilloma, and 32 of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, while 41 samples were from patients with Aspergillus colonization, including 15 cystic fibrosis (CF) and 12 non-CF patients. For blood donor controls, the Asp-WB specificity was 94%, while the kit displayed a sensitivity for the aspergillosis s.l. diagnosis of 88.6%, with a diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 119 (95% confidence interval [CI], 57 to 251). The DOR values were 185.22 (95% CI,78.79 to 435.45) and 43.74 (95% CI, 15.65 to 122.20) for the diagnosis of Aspergillus disease and Aspergillus colonization, respectively. Among the patients, the sensitivities of the Asp-WB in the diagnosis of Aspergillus colonization were 100% and 41.7% in CF and non-CF patients, respectively.

This study classified BLBCs from patients with breast carcinoma, and addressed the significance of c-Kit expression in these tumours.;Primary breast tumours were stained with antibodies against oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), cytokeratin 5/6 and c-Kit. The association between c-Kit, BLBC and survival was analysed.;A total of 667 patients with breast cancer were followed up for a median of 39 (range 6-72) months. Some 190 tumours (28·5 per cent) were classified as triple-negative for breast cancer (negative for oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2) and 149 (78·4 per cent) had characteristics of BLBC (positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and/or EGFR). c-Kit expression was detected in 111 (16·6 per cent) of 667 tumours. c-Kit-positive tumours were more commonly found among patients with BLBC (42 of 149, 28·2 per cent; P < 0·001) and in patients with nodal metastasis (47 of 216, 21·8 per cent; P = 0·014) than in those without. In patients with BLBC, the prognosis was significantly worse in those with c-Kit expression (P < 0·001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed c-Kit as an independent negative prognostic factor for cancer-specific survival in patients with BLBC (hazard ratio 2·29, 95 per cent confidence interval 1·11 to 4·72).;c-Kit might be a prognostic marker and possible molecular target for therapy in patients with BLBC.",

We identified 207 patients diagnosed with MCC in Finland in 1979-2004 and reviewed the histological diagnoses. Adequate clinical information, tumor tissue and DNA were available from 87 confirmed MCC cases. Presence of MCPyV DNA was assessed using quantitative PCR; p53, KIT, phospho-KIT, stem cell factor (SCF) and PDGFRα expression using immunohistochemistry and presence of mutations in KIT exons 9, 11, 13 and 17 and PDGFRA exons 10, 12, 14 and 18 using DNA sequencing. Most (77.0%) of the 87 tumors contained MCPyV DNA and 37 (42.5%) expressed KIT, whereas PDGFRα, p53, SCF and pKIT expression was less common (31.9, 22.8, 8.6 and 4.8%, respectively). No KIT or PFGFRA mutations were detected, but 10 (12.5%) of the 80 tumors studied harbored common PDGFRA exon 10 S478P substitution. Tumor p53 and KIT expression were associated with absence of MCPyV DNA (p = 0.01 and 0.009, respectively). Tumor p53 expression was associated with unfavorable MCC-specific survival (p = 0.021) and overall survival (p = 0.046), but tumor KIT expression only when stratified by presence of MCPyV DNA.

Our clinical survey showed that cystic oviducts were prevalent at rates of 10% and 15.1% in breeder and commercial hen flocks, respectively. Chlamydial antigens were detected in 20 of 50 pharyngeal swabs (40%) and in 17 of 20 oviduct tissues (85%) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigen detection kits. The isolated pathogen was identified as Chlamydophila psittaci via complement fixation test, PCE-ELISA, and immunofluorescence assay. Avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, and infectious bronchitis virus were excluded after oviduct tissues were inoculated onto the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonating eggs. The nucleotide sequence of the omp1 gene (accession no. EF202608) from the isolate was similar to that of C. psittaci avian type C (accession no. L25436). Typical cystic oviducts were observed in specific-pathogen-free hens inoculated intraperitoneally with the isolate. The high presence of chlamydial antigen is consistent with the cystic oviducts and poor egg production.

While some regions show advances in the control of the disease, others have among the highest incidence in the world. To reverse this situation the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has launched a regional project on cystic echinococcosis control and surveillance. An early concern of the program was the lack of a standardized diagnostic tool to monitor infection in dogs, a key target of control programs. Under this premise, we have developed a new copro-ELISA test after extensive screening of a large panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and polyclonal sera, which performs with high standards of sensitivity (92.6%) and specificity (86.4%) as established by necropsy diagnosis of dogs. The key component of the test, MAbEg9 has a convenient IgG isotype and reacts with a periodate-resistant epitope found in high molecular weight components of the worm. Time-course analysis of experimentally infected dogs showed that even animals with a very low number of parasites could be detected as early as day 20 post infection. The test was formulated in a ready-to-use kit format with proven stability of each component for a minimum of 3 months at room temperature. This characteristic facilitates its standardized use and shipping to other laboratories, which was demonstrated by the identical results obtained by two different laboratories in Peru and our own laboratory when a large number of field samples were analyzed independently in a blind fashion.",

Using a functional cell-based assay, we have identified two novel G-quadruplex ligands that reduce the transcription of a luciferase reporter driven from the G-quadruplex-containing c-KIT promoter. We have further shown that endogenous c-KIT expression in a human gastric carcinoma cell line is also reduced on treatment with these molecules.

In this study, we analyzed the latest lung cancer data in the COSMIC database, in order to find genomic \"hotspots\" that are frequently mutated in human lung cancer genomes. The results revealed that the most frequently mutated lung cancer genes are EGFR, KRAS and TP53. In recent years, EGFR and KRAS lung cancer test kits have been utilized for detecting lung cancer patients, but they presented many disadvantages, as they proved to be of low sensitivity, labor-intensive and time-consuming.

Previously untreated tumors were subjected to global gene expression arrays.;We analyzed 45 thymic tumors [thymoma, n = 38 (type A, n = 8; type B2, n = 22; type B3, n = 8); thymic carcinoma, n = 7]. One thymoma and one thymic carcinoma harbored KRAS mutations (G12A and G12V, respectively), and one thymoma had a G13V HRAS mutation. Three tumors displayed strong KIT staining. Two thymic carcinomas harbored somatic KIT mutations (V560del and H697Y). In cell viability assays, the V560del mutant was associated with similar sensitivities to imatinib and sunitinib, whereas the H697Y mutant displayed greater sensitivity to sunitinib. Genomic profiling revealed distinct differences between type A to B2 thymomas versus type B3 and thymic carcinomas. Moreover, array-based comparative genomic hybridization could readily distinguish squamous cell carcinomas of the thymus versus the lung, which can often present a diagnostic challenge.;Comprehensive genomic analysis suggests that thymic carcinomas are molecularly distinct from thymomas.

Aberrant activation of c-Kit results in dysregulated signaling and is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous cancers. The development of more specific and effective c-Kit therapies is warranted given its essential role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we describe the biological properties of CK6, a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the extracellular region of human c-Kit. CK6 specifically binds c-Kit receptor with high affinity (EC 50 = 0.06 nM) and strongly blocks its interaction with SCF (IC 50 = 0.41 nM) in solid phase assays. Flow cytometry shows CK6 binding to c-Kit on the cell surface of human small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), melanoma, and leukemia tumor cell lines. Furthermore, exposure to CK6 inhibits SCF stimulation of c-Kit tyrosine kinase activity and downstream signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (AKT), in addition to reducing tumor cell line growth in vitro. CK6 treatment significantly decreases human xenograft tumor growth in NCI-H526 SCLC (T/C% = 57) and Malme-3M melanoma (T/C% = 58) models in vivo. The combination of CK6 with standard of care chemotherapy agents, cisplatin and etoposide for SCLC or dacarbazine for melanoma, more potently reduces tumor growth (SCLC T/C% = 24, melanoma T/C% = 38) compared with CK6 or chemotherapy alone. In summary, our results demonstrate that CK6 is a c-Kit antagonist antibody with tumor growth neutralizing properties and are highly suggestive of potential therapeutic application in treating human malignancies harboring c-Kit receptor.

In this study, tissue microarrays with triplicate samples each from 27 mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinomas and 20 papillary renal cell carcinomas were created to simulate experience in renal biopsy specimens. From immunohistochemistry (IHC) data, published in the contemporary literature, a panel consisting of alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), cytokeratin 7 (CK7), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), renal cell carcinoma marker (RCC Ma), CD10, high molecular weight cytokeratin (HMWK), and c-kit was designed to test its utility in differential diagnosis.

This largest study to date on IHC of mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma dispels the specificity of AMACR for papillary renal cell carcinoma among the RCC subtypes. The histogenesis of mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma from the distal nephron continues to be debatable, as our study showed the expression of the proximal convoluted tubule-related marker AMACR among these tumors. Thus, in tumors with predominant compact tubular growth and focal papillary architectures, careful attention to the presence of a low-grade spindle cell population may be helpful in the distinction of mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma, as the key immunohistochemical stains for papillary renal cell carcinoma are also expressed in this subtype of renal cell carcinoma.",

There are two types of breast cyst and women with apocrine breast cyst may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer than women with breast cysts lined by flattened epithelium. The growth inhibitory effect of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) on epithelial cells suggests a potential protective role in breast cancer. TGF-beta is secreted as a high molecular weight complex in a biologically inactive or latent form and activation of TGF-beta is necessary for the exertion of its effects on target cells. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) has been found in breast cyst fluid (BCF) and it may have a protective effect on the development of several carcinomas by activating TGF-beta. As a similar molecule to PSA, PAP may also involve in this mechanism. We investigated the presence of PAP in two groups of BCF using an ELISA kit. PAP was found to be present in BCF but there was not a statistically significant difference between the two cyst groups.

Seventy-seven metaplastic cases were identified (1976-2006); 38 with tumor blocks available underwent pathologic confirmation before EGFR and KIT immunohistochemical analyses. A tissue microarray of malignant glandular and metaplastic elements was constructed and analyzed immunohistochemically for cytokeratin 5/6, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and p63, and by fluorescence in situ hybridization for EGFR and HER-2/neu. DNA isolated from individual elements was assessed for EGFR and KIT activating mutations. All assessable cases were negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and (except one) HER2. The majority were positive for cytokeratin 5/6 (58%), p63 (59%), and EGFR overexpression (66%); 24% were KIT positive. No EGFR or KIT activating mutations were present; 26% of the primary metaplastic breast carcinomas were fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive, displaying high EGFR copy number secondary to aneusomy (22%) and amplification (4%). We report here that metaplastic breast carcinoma is a basal-like breast cancer lacking EGFR and KIT activating mutations but exhibiting high EGFR copy number (primarily via aneusomy), suggesting that EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors should be evaluated in this molecular subset of breast carcinomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Collecting duct carcinoma is a highly aggressive renal epithelial malignancy, although it accounts for less than 1% of the incidence of renal epithelial neoplasms. Differential diagnoses between collecting duct carcinoma, pelvic urothelial carcinoma with marked invasion to the renal parenchyma (invasive urothelial carcinoma), and papillary renal cell carcinoma is often challenging. In our current study, we examined the utility of using commercially available antibodies, in conjunction with lectin histochemistry, for such differential diagnoses. We examined 17 cases of collecting duct carcinoma, 10 cases of invasive urothelial carcinoma and 15 cases of papillary renal cell carcinoma (type 1, 6 cases; type 2, 9 cases) in these evaluations. Our results indicated that Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1, E-cadherin, and c-KIT were frequently positive in collecting duct carcinoma and invasive urothelial carcinoma, in comparison with papillary renal cell carcinoma, which had negative results for CD10 and alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase. We found, however, that collecting duct carcinoma showed positivity for high-molecular-weight cytokeratin and low-molecular-weight cytokeratin at a low frequency compared with invasive urothelial carcinoma, and that these distinctions need further careful evaluation. In addition, high-molecular-weight cytokeratin positivity was not a reliable marker for collecting duct carcinoma. We conclude that Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 reactivity and positivity for E-cadherin and c-KIT are effective in distinguishing collecting duct carcinoma from papillary renal cell carcinoma, and that negative results for alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase and CD10 are potentially useful hallmarks of this distinction also. In contrast, a differential diagnosis for collecting duct carcinoma and invasive urothelial carcinoma will require careful examination of multiple routinely stained specimens, particularly in cases of in situ neoplastic lesions in the pelvic mucosa.",

The aim of this study was to assess the performance of molecular CFTR gene analysis from the French NBS cohort, to evaluate CF incidence, mutation detection rate, and allelic heterogeneity.;During the 8-year period, 5,947,148 newborns were screened for cystic fibrosis. The data were collected by the Association Française pour le Dépistage et la Prévention des Handicaps de l'Enfant. The mutations identified were classified into four groups based on their potential for causing disease, and a diagnostic algorithm was proposed.;Combining the genetic and sweat test results, 1,160 neonates were diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis. The corresponding incidence, including both the meconium ileus (MI) and false-negative cases, was calculated at 1 in 4,726 live births. The CF30 kit, completed with a comprehensive CFTR gene analysis, provides an excellent detection rate of 99.77% for the mutated alleles, enabling the identification of a complete genotype in 99.55% of affected neonates. With more than 200 different mutations characterized, we confirmed the French allelic heterogeneity.;The very good sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value obtained suggest that the four-tiered IRT/DNA/IRT/sweat test procedure may provide an effective strategy for newborn screening for cystic fibrosis.",

We incubated the specimen and the biotinylated detecting antibody simultaneously, and used HPR-conjugated streptavidin to generate a signal for quantification. The assay has a sensitivity of 3.8 ng/mL, and the coefficients of variation (CVs) for both within-day and day-to-day precision were all <10%.

We found no significant difference between females and males; however, age appeared to have an impact on the normal E-selectin value. We found that normal individuals over 60 years old had higher levels of circulating E-selectin (65.8+/-19.5 ng/mL, N=111) compared to those under 60 years old (59.5+/-18.1 ng/mL; P=0.002).

Cancer stem/progenitor cells (or tumor-initiating cells, TICs) are hypothesized to be chemoresistant, and the existence of TICs in ovarian cancer has been previously demonstrated. However, the key signals and molecular events regulating the formation and expansion of ovarian tumor-initiating cells (OTICs) remain elusive. Here, we show that c-Kit is not just a marker of OTICs, but also a critical mediator of the phenotype that can be a viable target for the treatment of ovarian cancer. In contrast to non-OICs, c-Kit was overexpressed in OTICs. Moreover, the use of small interfering RNA to inhibit c-Kit expression markedly attenuated the number and size of OTIC subpopulations, inhibited the expression of stem cell markers and decreased the tumorigenic capabilities of OTICs. Imatinib (Gleevec), a clinical drug that blocks c-Kit kinase activity, also demonstrated its inhibition potency on OTICs. In addition, cisplatin/paclitaxel, which killed non-OTICs, with c-Kit knockdown or imatinib revealed that this was critically required for intervening ovarian cancer progression and recurrence in vitro and in xenograft tumors in vivo. Similar results were obtained with OTICs derived from ovarian carcinoma patients. Studies into the mechanisms suggest an important role for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin and ATP-binding cassette G2 downstream of c-Kit. The tumor-promoting microenvironment, such as hypoxia, could promote OTICs via upregulation of c-Kit expression. These results unravel an integral role for c-Kit in ovarian neoplastic processes and shed light on its mechanisms of action.",

Their stabilization into G-quadruplex structures can find applications in the treatment of leukemias, mastocytosis, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and lung carcinomas which are often associated to c-kit mis-regulation. Also the most common skin cancer in domestic dog, mast cell tumor, is linked to a mutation and/or to an over-expression of c-kit, thus supporting dog as an excellent animal model. In order to assess if the G-quadruplex mediated mechanism of regulation of c-kit expression is conserved among the two species, herein we cloned and sequenced the canine KIT promoter region and we compared it with the human one in terms of sequence and conformational equilibria in physiologically relevant conditions. Our results evidenced a general conserved promotorial sequence between the two species. As experimentally confirmed, this grants that the conformational features of the canine kit1 sequence are substantially shared with the human one.

Infection of E. multilocularis (AE) was diagnosed in two patients by the detection of specific anti-Em2(plus) ELISA and -Em18 Western blot antibodies and finally confirmed by histopathology. The HA-DIA using bovine hydatid antigens showed a high sensitivity in serum samples from CE patients; specific antibodies were found in 29 of 30 CE patients (96.7%). One negative result has been observed in a patient 2.6 years after radical surgery with a subsequent albendazole chemotherapy. The Echinococcosis ELISA(R) (Dialab Diagnostic) was positive in 23 CE cases (76.7%). The correlation between the HA-DIA and the Echinococcosis ELISA(R) was statistically significant. By contrast, Echinococcus granulosus IgG ELISA(R) (Bordier Affinity Products) gave positive results in only 12 of 30 CE patients (40.0%). Sera from two AE patients were high positive in all three methods analysed in our study. In non-endemic areas, due to the between-strains variations and differences in cyst immunogenic activity, related to the natural history of the parasite, a choice of an optimal method for a diagnosis of liver cystic echinococcosis has been discussed.The high diagnostic sensitivity and a faster one-step procedure, in comparison to traditional enzyme immunoassays, make the HA-DIA a very useful method for the diagnosis of CE in non-endemic areas, especially in a case of small or degenerating lesions and sterile echinococcal cysts with a low immunogenicity.

The pathogenesis of TGCT is closely linked to primordial germ cells (PGCs) or gonocytes. The receptor tyrosine kinase (c-KIT) is necessary for migration and survival of PGCs and is expressed in intratubular neoplastic germ cells (IGCNUs) and seminomas. We studied the frequency of c-KIT exon 11 and 17 mutations in 155 unilateral (108 seminomas and 47 non-seminomas) and 22 bilateral (18 seminomas, two embryonal carcinomas, two IGCNU) cases. While no mutations were detected in exon 11, the mutation frequency in exon 17 was significantly higher in bilateral (14/22, 63.6%) compared to unilateral TGCT (10/155, 6.4%) (p < 0.001). Different activating mutations (Y823D, D816V, D816H and N822K) were detected in bilateral TGCT. Y823D mutation was identical in both testes in three cases and quantitative pyrosequencing showed that up to 76% of the cells analysed in tumour samples carried this mutation. One bilateral synchronous seminoma revealed a S821F mutation in one testis and a Y823D mutation contralaterally. To study the role of c-KIT in TGCT progression, we compared its expression in 41 seminomas and adjacent IGCNUs. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that c-KIT expression was significantly reduced in seminomas compared to IGCNUs (p < 0.006) and that there were no significant changes in c-KIT mRNA copy numbers in progressed compared to low-stage seminomas. In summary, our study shows that patients with c-KIT mutations are more prone to develop a bilateral TGCT and suggests that in a portion of bilateral TGCTs, c-KIT mutations occur early during embryonal development, prior to the arrival of PGCs at the genital ridge. Furthermore, our findings show that c-KIT down-regulation occurs during the progression of IGCNU to seminoma.",

Unlike in mammary carcinoma, HER2 positivity in prostatic cancer is usually weak in intensity and focal in distribution.

It has been detected in some human carcinomas, but its expression in primary testicular germ cell tumors is unknown. Immunohistochemistry was used to study MAGEC2 protein in 325 primary testicular germ cell tumors, including 94 mixed germ cell tumors. Seminomatous and non-seminomatous components were separately arranged and evaluated on tissue microarrays. MAGEC2 expression was compared with POU5F1 (OCT3/4), SOX2, SOX17, KIT and TNFRSF8 (CD30). The mouse monoclonal anti-MAGEC2 antibody (clone LX-CT10.5) revealed a nuclear MAGEC2 expression with little or no background staining. MAGEC2 expression was found in 238 of 254 seminomas (94%), but not in embryonal carcinomas (n=89). POU5F1 (OCT3/4) was positive in 97% of seminomas and all embryonal carcinomas. In contrast, KIT was positive in 94% of seminoma but also in 8% of embryonal carcinomas. TNFRSF8 (CD30) and SOX2 were negative in seminoma and positive in embryonal carcinoma (96 and 90%, respectively). SOX17 was positive in 94% of seminoma and negative in embryonal carcinoma. We conclude that MAGEC2 allows a reliable distinction of seminoma from embryonal carcinomas. Therefore, MAGEC2 represents an additional tool for the differential diagnosis of testicular germ cell tumors.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is globally the second most common cause of cancer mortality. The majority of HCC patients are diagnosed at advanced stage disease for which no curative treatments exist. TGF-β has been identified as a potential therapeutic target. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating its functional switch from a tumor suppressor to tumor promoter in HCC and its interactions with other signaling pathways are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate an aberrant molecular network between the TGF-β and c-KIT pathway that mediates the functional switch of TGF-β to a driver of tumor progression in HCC. TGF-β/SMAD2 signaling transcriptionally regulates expression of the c-KIT receptor ligand (stem cell factor [SCF]) with subsequent auto- and paracrine activation of c-KIT/JAK1/STAT3 signaling. SCF induces TGF-β1 ligand expression via STAT3, thereby forming a positive feedback loop between TGF-β/SMAD and SCF/c-KIT signaling. This network neutralizes TGF-β-mediated cell cycle inhibition and induces tumor cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition, migration, and invasion. Disruption of this feedback loop inhibits TGF-β tumor-promoting effects and restores its antiproliferative functions. Consistent with our in vitro data, we demonstrate SCF overexpression and its correlation to SMAD2 and STAT3 activation in human HCC tumors, advanced tumor-node-metastasis stages, and shorter survival.;Canonical TGF-β and c-KIT signaling forms a positive, tumor-promoting feedback loop. Disruption of this loop restores TGF-β tumor suppressor function and provides the rationale for targeting the TGF-β/SCF axis as a novel therapeutic strategy for HCC.",

However, full scanning of CFTR is needed for the diagnosis of patients with cystic fibrosis or CFTR-related disorders (including congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens) bearing rare mutations. Standard strategies for detecting point mutations rely on extensive scanning of the gene by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis or denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, which are time-consuming. Moreover, the haplotyping of IVS8-(TG)m and Tn tracts is still challenging despite several recent improvements. We have optimized both the detection of mutations and the haplotyping of IVS8 polyvariants in developing two methods: i) a rapid and robust direct sequence analysis of all exons/flanking introns of the CFTR gene based on single condition touchdown amplification/sequencing in 96-well plates, and ii) a fluorescent assay that allows haplotyping of IVS8-(TG)mTn even without family linkage study. Combined with search for rare large rearrangements, this strategy detected 87.9% of CFTR defects in congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens patients, a proportion considerably higher than those usually reported. These highly efficient tests, scanning each sample in a few days, greatly improve the genotyping of patients with CFTR-related symptoms and may be particularly important in emergency situations such as fetus with hyperechogenic bowel suggestive of cystic fibrosis.",

This study aims to detect possible CFTR gene mutations in Malays.;We analysed 50 blood samples from healthy Malays with no symptoms of CF. DNA was extracted from blood using commercially available extraction kits (Eppendorf, Germany). Identification of CFTR gene mutation was performed using the CF OLA (Oligonucleotide Ligation Assay) kit (Applied Biosystems, USA). The PCR-ligation products were electrophoresed on eight percent sequagel using an ABI PRISM 377 genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems, USA). Electrophoresis data was analysed using the Genotyper software and a report of the CF genotype for all loci tested was created using the CF Genotyper Template software. Out of 50, one sample (two percent) was detected to have the F508del mutation (3bp deletion at exon 10), which is one of the most common CFTR gene mutations in Caucasians.;The F508del mutation allele was detected in one subject. This indicates that she was a CF carrier.;We report the finding of a carrier of the F508del mutation of the CFTR gene in the Malay population.

At 78 years of age, he was pointed out to have gastric advanced tumor, and the biopsy showed moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. The gastric carcinoma was treated by chemotherapy. At 79 years of age, he was shown to have right lung shadow (2 cm in diameter) and brain shadow (cerebellar vermis) of 1 cm in diameter. Multiple biopsy and cytology of the lung failed to detect carcinoma cells. Biopsy of the brain was performed. The biopsy showed medullary undifferentiated carcinoma.

A pathological diagnosis of metastatic LCNEC form the lung was made. A molecular genetic analysis for KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17) and PDGFRA (exons 12 and 18) genes identified no mutations of the KIT and PDGFRA genes.

The 423 malignant lesions were composed of 367 cases of primary rectal carcinoma, 41 cases of carcinoma in adenoma, 7 cases of neuroendocrine tumor, 3 cases of malignant lymphoma, 2 cases of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and 3 cases of metastatic carcinoma. Of the 367 cases of primary rectal carcinoma, 37 cases were early carcinomas whose invasion was limited up to the submucosa (early rectal carcinoma). The remaining 330 cases were advanced carcinoma invading beyond the proper muscle layer. The histological types were well differentiated adenocarcinoma in 197 cases, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in 129 cases, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in 10 cases, mucinous adenocarcinoma in 24 cases, signet ring cell carcinoma in 6 cases, squamous cell carcinoma in 1 case In the 41 cases of carcinoma in adenoma, the carcinoma was well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, and all cases were early carcinomas without invasion or with little invasions to subserosa.

The study was limited to paraffin-embedded archival material of resected untreated pulmonary carcinomas, including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma. The sections were stained for putative stem cells markers (Musashi-1, Musashi-2, CD34, CD21, KIT, CD133, p63, and OCT-4). Positivity was read as isolated, focal, or diffuse staining. Stem cell markers were detected in all histological types of pulmonary carcinomas. There was a difference in the expression of markers among the histological types. Small cell carcinoma showed diffuse positivity for most of the markers; in contrast to focal or negative staining in other histological groups. An inverse relationship between CD21 and Musashi-1 was observed. No staining for OCT-4 and CD34 was seen in any of the tumor types. Hierarchical clustering based on marker expression separated tumors into two groups, with one group marked by high expression of Musashi-1 and KIT, contained most of the poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas and small cell carcinomas.

ADx-K-ras kit (real-time/double-loop probe PCR) was used to detect somatic tumor gene mutations compared with Sanger DNA sequencing using 583 colorectal and 244 lung cancer paraffin-embedded clinical samples. Genomic DNA was used in both methods; mutation rates at codons 12/13 and frequency of each mutation were detected and compared. The data show that 91.4% colorectal and 59.0% lung carcinoma samples were detected conclusively by DNA sequencing, whereas 100% colorectal and lung samples were detected by ADx-K-ras kit. K-ras gene mutations were detected in 32.9-27.4% colorectal samples using kit and sequencing methods, respectively. Whereas 10.6-8.3% lung cancer samples were positively detected by kit and sequencing methods, respectively. Notably, 172/677 showed mutations and 467/677 showed wild type by both methods; 38 samples showed mutations with kit but wild type with sequencing. Mutations in colorectal samples were as follows: GGT → GAT/codon-12 (35.1%); GGC → GAC/codon-13 (26.6%); GGT → GTT/codon-12 (18.2%); and GGT → GCT/codon-12 (1.6%). Mutations in lung samples were as follows: GGT > GTT/codon-12 (40.9%) and GGT > GCT/codon-12 (4.5%). In conclusion, K-ras mutations involved 32.2% colorectal and 10.6% lung samples among this cohort. ADx-K-ras real-time PCR showed higher detection rates (P < 0.05). The kit method has good clinical applicability as it is simple, fast, less prone to contamination and hence can be used effectively and reliably for clinical screening of somatic tumor gene mutations.",

The patients in the study were followed for up to 12 mo with repeated urine cytological testing, cystoscopy, and bladder biopsy when clinically indicated. Nineteen cases tested positive, and 81 cases tested negative on the BTA stat test. VUC diagnosed three cases as unequivocally positive for TCC, 93 cases as negative, and four cases in which unqualified atypical urothelial cells were noted. TCC was confirmed by cystoscopy and bladder biopsy in three of three cases diagnosed by VUC and in three of 19 cases that tested positive by the BTA stat test. These findings resulted in an 84% false-positive rate for the BTA stat test and no false-positive cases for VUC during the 12-mo follow-up period.

An endoscopy revealed a large polypoid tumor in the bladder, and urine cytology demonstrated malignant cells. A cystectomy was performed. The patient is now alive without metastasis 4 months after the operation. Grossly, a large polypoid tumor (5 x 6 x 5 cm) was present in the bladder. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of high-grade transitional cell carcinoma element (10% in area) and sarcomatoid element (90% in area). There was a gradual transition between the two. The tumor cells were invaded into peribladder tissue (pT3b). Immunohistochemically, the sarcomatoid element was positive for four types of pancytokeratins, high-molecular weight cytokeratin (CK), CK5/6, CK7, CK18, CK19, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), vimentin, p53 protein, p63, Ki-67 (labeling = 92%), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA). It was negative for CK14, CK20, melanosome, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), desmin, S100 protein, myoglobin, alpha-smooth muscle antigen (ASMA), CD34, chromogranin, synaptophysin, CD56, CD68, and KIT. The transitional cell carcinoma element showed similar immunoreactivity except for negative CK5/6, positive CK20, and negative vimentin. A molecular genetic analysis of KIT gene (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17) and PDGFRA (exons 12 and 18) gene with the use of PCR-direct sequencing showed no mutations. The present case is the first report of sarcomatoid carcinoma of the urinary bladder demonstrating extensive immunohistochemistry and mutational status of KIT and PDGFRA genes. The sarcomatoid carcinoma in the present case may be derived from sarcomatous differentiation of high-grade transitional cell carcinoma.",

This study investigates the presence of SCF and c-kit protein in 32 orchiectomy specimens of patients with testicular cancer, in 5 specimens of normal testicular tissue and in three established non-seminomatous germ-cell cancer cell lines (H12.1, H32, 577ML) by an immunohistochemical approach. Out of 9 testicular cancer specimens classified as pure seminomas, 7 (78%) showed a strong immunohistochemical reaction for both SCF and c-kit protein on the surface of the tumour cells. Fourteen non-seminomatous germ-cell tumours composed of embryonal carcinoma were completely negative for both SCF and c-kit proteins and only faint positivity was found in 6 tumours (26%). Differentiated teratomatous structures within the specimens on non-seminomatous tumours showed a strong immunohistochemical reaction for SCF and c-kit protein in 8 of 11 (73%) cases. All three testicular cancer cell lines showed only faint staining reactions for c-kit protein and none for SCF. No secretion of SCF by the three lines in vitro was detected. The addition of high concentrations of SCF (100 ng/ml) to the testicular cancer cell lines in culture conditions without fetal calf serum resulted in a 1.4 to 3-fold growth stimulation compared to cell growth in serum-free medium alone. This effect was not detectable when the cells were cultured in serum-containing media. In the normal testicular tissue the germ-cells displayed a strong immunohistochemical reaction for c-kit protein while SCF positivity was found at the tubular membrane and on the surface of Sertoli cells. The SCF/c-kit system may possess a regulatory function in normal testicular tissue by possibly providing the microenvironment necessary for spermatogenesis. With the development of testicular cancer, this regulatory system seems to be lost, particularly in non-seminomatous germ-cell tumours. A growth-stimulatory effect of high concentrations of SCF on non-seminomatous testicular cancer cell lines can be detected only in culture conditions with serum-free media. The effects achievable by the combination of SCF with other growth factors need to be further studied, as well as the role of the c-kit/SCF regulatory system for normal spermatogenesis and its possible implications for the understanding and treatment of male infertility.",

The purpose of this study is to examine the additional markers that would be useful for differentiating between thymic carcinoma and thymoma type B3. We performed a tissue microarray analysis of surgically resected thymic tumor specimens from 12 cases of thymic carcinoma, 7 cases of type B3 thymoma, and 68 cases of other types of thymoma. Immunostaining using 49 antibodies was scored based on staining intensity and the percentage of cells that stained positive. Seven proteins that were selected by the staining scores, namely, GLUT-1 (167 vs 4), CA-IX (110 vs 15), c-kit (162 vs 44), CD5 (33 vs 0), MUC-1 (54 vs 0), CEA (42 vs 0), and CK18 (110 vs 42), were significantly higher in the thymic carcinomas than in the type B3 thymomas. The staining sensitivity and specificity of the antibodies for thymic carcinoma were GLUT-1, sensitivity 72% and specificity 100%; CA-IX, 58 and 71%; c-kit, 72 and 85%; CD5, 33 and 100%; CK18, 58 and 71%; MUC-1, 25 and 100%; and CEA, 33 and 100%. Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) is the best marker for thymic carcinoma because it had the highest sensitivity and specificity. Positive immunostaining for a combination of three markers, namely, GLUT-1, CD5, and CEA, enabled differentiation of thymic carcinoma with 91.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity.

Several studies have described TNC (ER, PR, HER2) as a surrogate for basal-like breast carcinoma. However, there is sparse literature on triple-negative lobular carcinoma (TNLC), as most of them show hormone receptor expression. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of clinicopathologic parameters of TNLC that has been demonstrated in invasive ductal carcinoma.;Clinicopathologic parameters and immunohistochemical stains for ER, PR, E-cadherin, HER2, MIB1, and fluorescent in situ hybridization for HER2 of 255 ILC cases were retrieved. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis was performed for p53, c-kit, vimentin, p16, cyclinD1, and BCL2 on 78 cases where 12 were TNC cases and 66 were non-TNC cases.;Of the 255 ILC cases, 218 (85.5%) were classic and 37 (14.5%) were pleomorphic. Seventy-seven (30.1%) cases showed axillary lymph node metastasis. There were 14 of the 255 TNC cases (5.49%) that showed higher incidence in the elderly patients. Six of the 37 (16.21%) cases were pleomorphic and 8 of the 218 (3.7%) cases were classic. Positivity for vimentin was seen in 8 of the 12 cases (67.7%), CK 5 in 3 of the 12 (25%) cases, p16 in 11 of the 12 (91.6%) cases, p53 in 8 of the 12 (66.7%) cases, c-kit in 6 of the 12 (50%) cases, and cyclinD1 in 6 of the 12 cases (50%) indicating basal-like phenotype in 3 cases and nonbasal-like phenotype in 9 cases. There was no statistical significance in lymph node metastasis, tumor recurrence, and distant metastasis between TNC and non-TNC.;TNLC showed distinct clinicopathologic features such as more frequently seen in the elderly, pleomorphic, larger tumor size, increased expression of vimentin, CK 5, p16, p53, and c-kit. Not all cases showed basal-like phenotype. TNLC is less frequently seen as compared with TNC in invasive ductal carcinoma.",

Cervical serous, clear cell, and small cell carcinomas differ from the conventional endocervical adenocarcinoma in their clinical characteristics. The data on the role of HPV in their pathogenesis are limited. In this study, we examined the presence of high-risk HPV-DNA in rare types of cervical carcinoma using polymerase chain reaction-based test. In-house cervical serous, clear cell, and small cell carcinoma cases accessioned between 2000 and 2008 were tested for HPV by polymerase chain reaction amplification of DNA extracted from deparaffinized sections using Roche AMPLICOR HPV Amplification Detection and Control Kits. The kit detects all 13 high-risk HPV-DNA genotypes. The positive cut-off point for AMPLICOR HPV Test was A450 = 0.2. We identified 4 serous, 3 clear cell, 1 mixed clear cell and serous, and 5 small cell carcinomas. High-risk HPV-DNA tested positive in 3 out of 4 serous carcinomas, 2 out of 3 cervical clear cell carcinomas, and all 5 cases of small cell carcinoma and the mixed cell type. Our report documents HPV status in a series of archival unusual types of adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. It suggests a robust association between high-risk HPV and these rare subtypes. Despite their unique clinical setting and morphologic appearance, the majority of these tumors likely share a common HPV-mediated carcinogenic pathway. Our observation is particularly significant in cervical cancer prevention as we enter the HPV vaccination era.",

Persistence of fetal spermatogonial characteristics was implicated in the emergence of testicular germ cell tumors. The objective of this study was to analyze the tubular architecture in contralateral testes of patients with NSTGCT. We studied morphologic alterations, expression patterns of markers for the integrity of the germinal epithelium (gap junction proteins connexin 43 and 26), as well as of the embryonic markers c-KIT and placental alkaline phosphatase (PlAP), both established markers to detect carcinoma in situ (CIS). In all samples, tubules showing maturation of germ cells up to spermatozoa were observed. In addition, tubules with alterations in tubular architecture and with impaired spermatogenesis occurred. In tubules showing aberrant spermatogenesis, connexin 43 (Cx43) signal was down-regulated and a shift of signal from gap junctions to the cytoplasm occurred. Concomitantly, Cx26 was found highly up-regulated in tubules with incomplete and aberrant germ cell maturation. All testes exhibited single spermatogonia with positive reaction for c-KIT and a significant positive correlation was found between the mean number of c-KIT positive spermatogonia per tubule and the percentage of tubules presenting severely impaired spermatogenesis. Our data show alterations of the normal architecture of the germinal epithelium and disturbances of spermatogenesis in the contralateral testes of patients with NSTGCT in all cases evaluated. The concomitant occurrence of c-KIT positive spermatogonia and defects in tubular architecture is in line with the hypothesis that patients with NSTGCT suffer from disturbed germ cell development.",

The most well-studied is its association with carcinoma of the uterine cervix. In January 1989, we embarked on a prospective, multivariate study at the University Hospital, Kuala Lumpur to assess the usefulness of serologically assaying SCC-Ag (using the Abbott RIA diagnostic kit) in our patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix. We were also interested to ascertain whether SCC-Ag is a 'general' marker for all histological types of cervical carcinoma or specific for squamous carcinoma. From the time of commencement to June 1990, 35 newly-diagnosed and histologically-proven cases were entered into the study. Of these, 4 were keratinising squamous carcinoma, 18 large cell non-keratinising carcinoma, 3 adenosquamous carcinoma, 7 adenocarcinoma and 3 carcinoma-in-situ. Our preliminary results show that all keratinising squamous carcinoma and 1/3 each of large cell non-keratinising carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma and carcinoma-in-situ had positive pre-therapy serum SCC-Ag levels (i.e greater than 2 ng/ml, 2 ng/ml being an arbitrarily selected 'cut-off' value). In contrast, no adenocarcinoma was serologically positive. In addition, keratinising squamous carcinoma had the highest mean pre-therapy serum SCC-Ag level. The results imply that serum SCC-Ag is related to the (1) presence of squamous and not glandular differentiation and (2) degree of squamous differentiation.",

The recognition of polymeric or fragmented CT by polyclonal antibody was thought to be the causative factor for the hypercalcitoninemia after total thyroidectomy in the patients with PTC. Knowledge of the false positive CT determination makes it important to employ different CT assay kits, especially the new generation of two-site immunoassays using two monoclonal antibodies against distinct epitopes of human CT, although the new generation kits are not clinically available in Japan.",

The number of requests is growing, owing to the increasingly wide range of recognized CFTR gene diseases (cystic fibrosis, congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, disseminated bronchiectasis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and chronic pancreatitis), and the availability of efficient molecular tools for detecting mutations. A growing number of tests capable of simultaneously detecting several frequent CF mutations are being developed, and commercial kits are now available. The most recent kits detect nearly 90% of defective alleles in Caucasians, a rate high enough for carrier screening and for the majority of diagnostic requests. However, because of the wide variety of molecular defects documented in the CFTR gene, only a limited number of laboratories have mastered the entire panoply of necessary techniques, while other laboratories have to refer certain cases to specialized centers with complementary and/or scanning tools at their disposal. A good knowledge of CFTR diseases and their molecular mechanisms, together with expertise in the various techniques, is crucial for interpreting the results. Diagnostic strategies must take into account the indication, the patient's ethnic origin, and the time available in the framework of genetic counseling. This review presents the methods most frequently used for detecting CFTR gene mutations, and discusses the strategies most suited to the different clinical settings.",

Sensitive and accurate quantification of HBV DNA is necessary to monitor patients with chronic hepatitis B who are receiving antiviral therapy to determine treatment response and adapt therapy. We evaluated and compared the clinical performance of two HBV DNA assays based on different technologies: the RealArt HBV PCR Kit (Abbott HBV DNA PCR kit, real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, detection limit: 27 IU/mL) and the VERSANT bDNA 3.0 assay (Bayer, branched DNA signal amplification assay, detection limit: 357 IU/mL). Serum levels of HBV DNA in 173 chronic HBV carriers were determined using both the RealArt HBV PCR Kit and the VERSANT bDNA 3.0 test. Of the 173 samples analyzed for baseline viral load detection, HBV DNA was quantifiable in 147 patients (82.1%) by the RealArt HBV PCR Kit, which was significantly higher than the 92 (53.2%) samples quantified by the VERSANT bDNA 3.0 assay. A total of 86 (49.7%) samples were quantifiable by both assays, whereas 25 (14.5%) were below the detection limit of both assays. The HBV DNA quantification values measured by the RealArt HBV PCR Kit and the VERSANT bDNA 3.0 assay were positively correlated (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r = 0.932, p < 0.001). On average, the results derived from the RealArt HBV PCR Kit were 0.67 log lower than those of the VERSANT bDNA 3.0 assay. HBV DNA concentrations were significantly higher in 63 HBV e antigen (HBeAg)-seropositive patients than in 110 HBeAg-seronegative patients (5.42 +/- 2.34 logs vs. 3.21 +/- 2.27 logs, p < 0.001). The RealArt HBV PCR Kit is more sensitive and has a wider dynamic range than the VERSANT bDNA 3.0 assay in the clinical setting of chronic hepatitis B patients. The sensitivity and wide dynamic range of the PCR assay allow optimal monitoring and timely adaptation of antiviral therapy. Nevertheless, the HBV DNA values measured by the RealArt HBV PCR Kit and the VERSANT bDNA 3.0 assay were significantly correlated.",

However, delineation of high-grade renal cell carcinomas such as collecting duct (Bellini) carcinoma from urothelial cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis is critical, as it conveys important therapeutic implications. We assessed the so far neglected differential diagnostic role of protein gene product 9.5, a neuropeptide involved in intracellular proteolysis, in terms of differentiating invasive urothelial cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis from high-grade renal cell carcinomas infiltrating the renal medullary/sinus region. To this aim, 21 invasive urothelial cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis and 27 high-grade renal cell carcinomas (8 renal cell carcinomas with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation and 5 type 1 and 7 type 2 papillary renal cell carcinomas as well as 7 collecting duct carcinomas) were stained with antibodies directed against protein gene product 9.5, CD10, vimentin, CEA, p63, CK5/6, CK7, CK20, PAX2, PAX8, CD117 (c-Kit), AE1/3, α-methyl CoA racemase, actin, and desmin. Briefly, strong protein gene product 9.5 expression was observed in 6 (86%) of 7 collecting duct carcinomas, 8 (67%) of 12 papillary renal cell carcinomas, and 2 (25%) of 8 renal cell carcinomas with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation. Conversely, none of the 21 urothelial cell carcinomas investigated showed protein gene product 9.5 expression. Our findings suggest that protein gene product 9.5, particularly if used in conjunction with p63 and CK5/6, might be helpful in differentiating high-grade renal cell carcinomas from urothelial cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis, whereas its specificity with respect to the histologic subtyping of renal cell carcinomas seems to be low. However, because of the limited number of study cases enrolled in our investigation, our findings need to be validated in the future.",

Rising squamous cell carcinoma antigen levels preceded the clinical detection of disease in ten patients by a mean of 4.6 months (range 2-7.5 months); in the remaining five, squamous cell carcinoma antigen levels were elevated only when disease recurrence was documented. Although measurement of squamous cell carcinoma antigen levels is not a sensitive screening method for cervical cancer (sensitivity 53.3%), the test has good specificity (94.3%); the majority of patients with false-positive elevations had other genital tract squamous cell neoplasias.

New therapeutic targets are currently under investigation, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as well as KIT. A number of studies have shown protumorigenic potential of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in a variety of human malignancies, but so far it is unknown whether COX-2 is expressed in primary malignancies of the thymus. Using tissue microarrays, the expression of COX-2, microsomal-PGES-1 and -PGES-2 (mPGES-1 and mPGES-2), as well as EGFR was evaluated in different subtypes of thymoma and thymic carcinomas. COX-2 was expressed in all subtypes as determined by immunohistochemistry. Some cases of type B2 and thymic carcinomas had COX-2 staining levels classified as mild to moderate. However, when measuring the optical color intensity, no significant differences could be detected. Concerning the expression levels, a weak correlation between the expression of COX-2, mPGES-1 and mPGES-2 as well as EGFR was found. Furthermore, additional cases of thymomas and thymic carcinomas were analyzed by COX-2 Western immunoblot analysis and were compared to normal thymi. The analysis showed that thymomas and thymic carcinomas had a significantly stronger COX-2 expression than that of the normal thymi (p < 0.04). In summary, COX-2 is expressed in all subtypes of thymomas and thymic carcinomas and thus represents, in addition to EGFR and KIT, a potential therapeutic target. Further studies are needed in order to determine whether a combined therapy using COX-2 inhibitors in addition to the evolving anti-EGFR antibody therapy may be considered as a treatment option.",

The tumor was composed of cells that showed neuroendocrine-type nuclear features with hyperchromasia, nuclear molding, occasional small nucleoli, and a chromatin pattern that was finely granular. The tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 20 (CK20), neuron specific enolase, pancytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and chromogranin A expression. Ki-67, a marker of proliferation, was also positive in>90% of cells. The tumor cells showed intense expression of Bcl-2 oncoprotein and mild to moderate expression of c-KIT. Synaptophysin, neurofilament, CD45, CD56, CD10, S-100, HMB-45, cytokeratin 7, and thyroid transcription factor 1 were negative. This pattern of staining is consistent with a Merkel cell carcinoma.

Many solid tumors express SCF and this leads to mast cell recruitment to tumors and release of mediators linked to tumor angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. Here, we investigate whether FES protein-tyrosine kinase, a downstream effector of KIT signaling in mast cells, is required for migration of mast cells toward SCF-expressing mammary tumors. Using a novel agarose drop assay for chemotaxis of bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) toward SCF, we found that defects in chemotaxis of fes-null BMMCs correlated with disorganized microtubule networks in polarized cells. FES displayed partial colocalization with microtubules in polarized BMMCs and has at least two direct microtubule binding sites within its N-terminal F-BAR and SH2 domains. An oligomerization-disrupting mutation within the Fer/CIP4 homology-Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (F-BAR) domain had no effect on microtubule binding, whereas microtubule binding to the SH2 domain was dependent on the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket. FES involvement in mast cell recruitment to tumors was tested using the AC2M2 mouse mammary carcinoma model. These tumor cells expressed SCF and promoted BMMC recruitment in a KIT- and FES-dependent manner. Engraftment of AC2M2 orthotopic and subcutaneous tumors in control or fes-null mice, revealed a key role for FES in recruitment of mast cells to the tumor periphery. This may contribute to the reduced tumor growth and metastases observed in fes-null mice compared with control mice. Taken together, FES is a potential therapeutic target to limit the progression of tumors with stromal mast cell involvement.",

OSSN ranges from mild, moderate, severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ (CIS) to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Recent findings on cancer stem cells theory indicate that population of stem-like cell as in neoplasia determines its heterogeneity and complexity leading to varying tumor development of metastatic behavior and recurrence. Cancer stem cell markers are not much explored in the cases of OSSN. In the present study, we aim to evaluate the expression of stem cells using stem cell markers mainly p63, ABCG2, c-KIT (CD117) and CD44 in OSSN tissue, which could have prognostic significance. The present study tries for the first time to explore expression of these stem markers in the cases of OSSN. These cases are subdivided into two groups. One group comprises of carcinoma in situ (n = 6) and the second group comprises of invasive carcinoma (n = 6). The mean age at presentation was 52 years; with 53 years for CIS group and 52 years for SCC group. From each group section from the paraffin block were taken for the IHC staining of p63, c-Kit, ABCG2 and CD44. Our experiments show high expression of P63 and CD44 in the cases of CIN and SCC. Both CIS and SCC displayed positive staining with p63, with more than 80% cells staining positive. However minimal expression of c-kit in both CIN and SCC. But surprisingly we got high expression of ABCG2 in cases of carcinoma in situ as compared to that of invasive squamous cell carcinoma. More than 50% of cells showed CD44 positivity in both CIS and SCC groups.

The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers were tabulated. We did not find any randomized controlled trials on target therapies for the thymic malignancies, due to the very small incidence of this tumour, and it seems unlikely that there will be any such trials in the foreseeable future. Three studies on target therapies showed that several cases of thymic malignancies were reported to have partial response (PR) to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as cetuximab and erlotinib, whereas, one study on erlotinib and another on gefitinib showed no activity. Proto-oncogene c-KIT (KIT) mutant thymic carcinomas were noted to benefit from target therapies, implying that systematic sequencing of KIT in thymic carcinoma tumours may be warranted for optimal patient selection. A study that investigated the efficacy of cixutumumab, a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, indicated that relapsed thymomas tended to respond, whereas thymic carcinoma did not. The antiangiogenesis agent belinostat had modest antitumour activity in heavily pretreated thymoma, but no response to thymic carcinoma was found. Several cases with metastatic thymic carcinoma showed that multitargeted kinase inhibitors, such as sunitinib and sorafenib, were effective. We concluded that, as the side-effects of the agents were tolerable in almost all reported cases, target therapies can be an option for patients with heavily pretreated thymoma. ",

The role of the stem cell factor/kit pathway has been investigated in different human tumors especially in chronic myelocytic leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor and an autocrine loop has been assumed in small cell lung carcinoma, and recently in ES and PNET. Our aim is to investigate the c-kit expression in ES and PNET and also to assessed if c-kit has any role in disease process.;We thoroughly searched the archives of the Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cukurova University Turkey, between 2000 and 2004; and found 14 ES and 14 PNET paraffin embedded tissues. We carried out the detection of the c-kit expression by immunohistochemical staining.;The patient's median age was 23.7 +/-14.6 (12 male and 16 female). Five were diagnosed as metastatic disease whereas 23 were diagnosed as non-metastatic disease at admission. The mean follow up period was 38.9 +/- 22.3 months. The main localization of the disease was lower extremity (32.1%), and others were as follows: head and neck 25%, thorax and abdomen 14.3%, pelvic and upper extremity 7.1% (11 were localized skeletal and 17 were extraskeletal). According to treatment modalities, 10 were treated with surgery alone, 11 with surgery and chemotherapy, and 7 with surgery, radiation therapy and also with chemotherapy. The primary tumor was lower than 5 cm in its dimension in 21 patients. While in 5 patients, tumor was more than 5 cm but did not exceed 10 cm, it was >10 cm in 2 patients. The c-kit expression was positive in 7 patients both cytoplasmic and membranously, whereas 8 patients were positive cytoplasmically. In 5 PNET patients, c-kit expression were stained immunohistochemically in over 50% and in 3 of ES patients. There was no significant correlation between c-kit expression and gender, localization, metastatic status, treatment modalities and tumor. Although in survival analysis, patients treated with surgery alone lived longer, while >50% of patients treated with c-kit expression lived for a shorter period.;We suggest that therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor for PNET and ES patients may be an alternative in addition to standard therapy modalities, especially in patients non-responsive to standard therapy.",

The association remained significant after the adjustment for effects of other hepatocellular carcinoma risk factors, including hepatitis B surface antigen carrier status, positivity of serum antibody to hepatitis C virus, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, past liver disease history, and dietary habits. The multivariate-adjusted relative risk of hepatocellular carcinoma for men with testosterone levels in the upper tertile was 4.1 (95% confidence interval = 1.3-13.2) compared with those having levels in the middle or lower tertiles (P = 0.016).

Staining for synaptophysin, chromogranin A, TTF1, c-kit, CD44, and p16 was performed. Analyses for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 5 polymorphic microsatellite markers (D3S1300, D9S171, D11S914, D13S319, and TP53) and X-chromosome inactivation were performed. Of 17 cases with available blocks, 13 (76%) were synaptophysin+, 8 (47%) were chromogranin A+, 8 (47%) were TTF1+, 7 (41%) were c-kit+, and 6 (35%) were CD44+. Strong patchy or strong diffuse p16 staining was seen in all cases.

The basal phenotype, so-named because of an immunohistologic profile that is similar to myoepithelial cells of the breast, has poor outcomes. While the invasive basal phenotype has been described, there is a paucity of literature regarding the existence or recognition of a precursor lesion. We searched our CoPath database for breast carcinomas in the age group of 37 years or less, and this yielded 98 cases from the years 2001 to April 2006. Pathology reports were screened for those cases that were negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors and HER-2/neu (triple negative). A total of 16 cases (16/98, 16%) fulfilled these criteria. Histology was reviewed and immunostains were performed for Cytokeratins 14, 17, and 5/6, vimentin, EGFR, c-kit, smooth muscle actin and p63. All 16 cases had a high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham score 9/9, with geographic necrosis, good circumscription and lymphoid infiltrates. Of the 16 cases, 13 exhibited at least one area of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The DCIS types were solid, flat or micropapillary, high nuclear grade, with comedonecrosis and invariably associated with intense lymphoid inflammatory cell infiltration. Of 16 invasive cases, 14 (88%) were positive for CK14, CK17, CK5/6 and EGFR; 94% were vimentin positive, while half or less of cases were positive for smooth muscle actin, c-kit or p63. All of the DCIS components demonstrated the same immunohistologic profile as the invasive component. A DCIS component of solid, flat or micropapillary type exists in the basal phenotype of breast carcinoma, and it demonstrates the same immunophenotype as the invasive carcinoma, typically positive for CK5/6, CK14, CK17, vimentin and EGFR, but negative for ER/PR and HER-2/neu.",

Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) (Vysis) was performed on all cases with positive or equivocal immunohistochemical results. The Dako A485 showed HER-2 overexpression in 53% of carcinomas, while the HT showed 21% positive (HT 2+ 8%, HT 3+ 13%) and 79% negative (HT 0 67%, HT 1+ 12%). FISH for HER-2 gene amplification on all the HT 1+ and HT 2+ cases was negative, whereas FISH analysis of all HT 3+ cases was positive, with the exception of one case which could not be analysed for technical reasons. When histological subtype was analysed, only grade 3 infiltrating duct carcinomas were FISH-positive, suggesting that histological grading and subtyping may be able to triage carcinomas suitable for HER-2 testing. We suggest that the HT or a similar standardised immunohistochemical study for HER-2 can be used to screen breast carcinomas. We then recommend FISH where the carcinoma is HT 2+.

With attention to the direct connection between the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of tumor cells and the pharmacological effects of specific inhibitors, we systematically assessed the RTK expressions of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung [HGNECs, including SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC)].;Fifty-one LCNEC and 61 SCLC patients who underwent surgical resection were enrolled in this research. As a control group, 202 patients with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 122 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs) were also analyzed. All the tumors were stained with antibodies for 10 RTKs: c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET, and ROS1.;The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. In particular, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20 % of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.;Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs. The exclusive c-Kit positivity observed among HGNECs suggests that c-Kit might be a distinctive RTK in HGNEC.",

Such statistical analysis displayed that some categories of the gene product-based immunophenotyping variables are grouped in the plot identifying three groups: the first group related to carcinoids, the second to small-cell carcinomas, and the third to large-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas.

The general problems in this distinction include histological mimicry of other mesenchymal tumors with GIST, occasional KIT-negativity of GIST, and KIT-positivity of non-GISTs. Up to 5% to 10% gastric GISTs and <2% of intestinal GISTs can be KIT-negative. The identification of these tumors as GISTs is based on knowledge of the spectrum of GIST morphology, and can be supported by molecular diagnosis of KIT and PDGFRA mutations (the latter pertain to gastric tumors). True smooth muscle tumors (rare in GI tract except in esophagus and colon) can be separated from GISTs by the eosinophilic tinctorial quality of tumor cells, positivity for smooth muscle markers, and negativity for KIT. Desmoids can form large GIST-like masses, but are composed of spindled or stellate-shaped cells in a densely collagenous stroma. Negativity for KIT and nuclear positivity for beta-catenin are differentiating features. GI schwannomas, melanoma, and rare primary clear cell sarcoma are S100-positive, usually with characteristic histology. The latter two can be KIT-positive. KIT-positive non-GISTs include some sarcomas, especially angiosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma, extramedullary myeloid tumor, seminoma, and a few carcinomas, notably small cell carcinoma of lung. Spurious KIT-positivity, seen with some polyclonal KIT antibodies, has been a source of confusion leading to probable false-positive results in fibroblastic tumors and occasional other sarcomas, such as leiomyosarcomas. Integration of histological features with carefully standardized immunohistochemistry, supported by KIT and PDGFRA mutation analysis, is the cornerstone of state-of-the art differential diagnosis of GIST. To comprehensively capture all GISTs, KIT immunostains should be performed on all unclassified epithelioid and mesenchymal tumors of the abdomen. This is a US government work.

It has been recently reported that molecular-targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are effective in patients with lung carcinoma. In efforts to improve the prognosis of patients with LCNEC, we analyzed gene expression, gene mutations and immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of known molecular targets in LCNECs, and compared the expression to that of lung adenocarcinomas (ACs). Thirteen patients with primary LCNEC and 14 patients with AC were analyzed. We evaluated IHC expression for c-KIT, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), gene mutations for EGFR, K-ras and c-kit, and gene expression using fluorescence in situ hybridization for EGFR. In cases with LCNEC, the IHC expression of c-KIT, HER2 and VEGF was 76.9, 30.8 and 100%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the IHC expression of c-KIT and HER2 between the LCNEC and AC cases. Two cases of LCNEC had overexpression of HER2, and the frequency of EGFR gene mutations was higher in the the AC group, with only a single EGFR mutation (exon 18) identified in the LCNEC group. Although LCNEC had a higher rate of expression of c-KIT by IHC, no c-kit gene mutations were found.

The primary end-point was response rate (RR) including complete response or partial response (PR); secondary end-points included RR according to Choi criteria, disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS).;Thirty-seven patients (19 adenoid cystic cancers, ACC) were enrolled. Six PRs were recorded. RR was 16% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6-32; 11% in ACC and 22% in non-ACC). Choi criteria could be applied in 30 out of 37 cases with a RR of 50% (95% CI: 31-69%); DCR was 76% (95% CI: 59-88%). Incidence of ≥G3 adverse events was 29.7%. Median PFS and OS for the entire population were 5.9 months and 23.4 months, respectively. Median PFS and OS were 8.9 and 26.4 months for ACC versus 4.2 and 12.3 months for non-ACC patients. All the cases showed expression of PDGFRβ in the stroma and VEGFR2 in endothelial cells; PDGFRα positivity was found in the stroma of four (27%) cases. All except for two cases showed no PDGFRβ, VEGFR2 and PDGFRα expression in the tumour cells. KIT expression was restricted to ACC and a weak RET expression was limited to one adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified (NOS). No BRAF mutation was found. No correlation was observed between the sorafenib activity and the expression of its markers although all six responders (two ACC, one adenocarcinoma, NOS, one salivary duct cancer [SDC], one high-grade mucoepidermoid [HG-MEC] and one poorly-differentiated cancer) are enriched in the stromal component showing a PDGFRβ immunodecoration. In ACCs, immunohistochemistry revealed MYB protein expression in 15/16 cases (94%) and the MYB-NFIB fusion oncogene was observed in 9/14 (64%).;Sorafenib is the first anti-angiogenic agent to demonstrate activity in RMSGC patients, particularly in some histotypes such as HG-MEC, SDC and adenocarcinoma, NOS. The PDGFRβ-positive rich stromal component characterising these histotypes and the lack of correlation between the activity of sorafenib and its targets suggests anti-angiogenic effect as the prevalent mechanism of action of sorafenib in SGCs.",

In this study, the growth inhibition of oral carcinoma cell lines by sulforaphane was determined using aqueous soluble tetrazolium salts, and the growth of various oral cancer cell lines was attenuated. The migration and invasion activities of the cells also decreased, as observed in monolayer scratch assays and transwell invasion experiments.

At the molecular level, the secreted forms of MMP-1 and MMP-2 were down-regulated. The expressions of MMP-1 and MMP-2 did not change when a conventional tumoricidal agent paclitaxel was used.

The limitations of the current main tools, KIT immunohistochemistry and KIT/PDGFRA mutation analysis, include lack of KIT expression and mutations in some GISTs. In this study we examined 1168 GISTs of different sites and histologic subtypes, and 672 other tumors and normal tissues for discovered on GIST-1 (DOG1) clone K9, a newly introduced immunohistochemical marker, a chloride channel protein. All GISTs and selected non-GISTs were independently evaluated for KIT. In the GI tract, Cajal cells and gastric surface epithelia were DOG1-positive. The overall sensitivity of DOG1 and KIT in GISTs was nearly identical: 94.4% and 94.7%, and results in GISTs were generally concordant. Gastric spindle cell GISTs was nearly uniformly positive for both markers, whereas DOG1 performed slightly better in gastric epithelioid GISTs that included PDGFRA mutant GISTs. In the intestinal GISTs, KIT was slightly more sensitive than DOG1. Negativity for both DOG1 and KIT was observed in 2.6% of GISTs of GI tract. KIT or PDGFRA mutations were detected in 11/24 DOG1-negative GISTs supporting the diagnosis of GIST. DOG1 expression was also generally present in extragastrointestinal and metastatic GISTs. DOG1 was highly specific for GIST, but exceptional DOG1-positive other mesenchymal tumors included uterine type retroperitoneal leiomyomas, peritoneal leiomyomatosis, and synovial sarcomas (positive in 5/42, 4/17, and 6/37 cases). Leiomyomas colonized by DOG1-positive Cajal cells should not be confused with GISTs. DOG1 positivity was relatively common in esophageal squamous cell and gastric carcinomas, whereas it was rare in colorectal carcinomas. DOG1 should be added into the diagnostic panel evaluating GI and other abdominal tumors, but limitations in its sensitivity and specificity should be recognized.",

There are other standalone assays developed to detect poly-T alleles, such as heteroduplex analysis, High Resolution Melting (HRM) curve analysis, allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) and Sanger sequencing. In this report, we developed a simple and easy-to-implement multiplex AS-PCR assay using unlabeled standard length primers, which can be used as a reflex or standalone test for CFTR poly-T track analysis.

Steel factor (SF) or Kit ligand is produced as a membrane-bound form (mSF) and a soluble form. Because both primary gynecological tumors and primary leukemic cells from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) have been shown to coexpress c-Kit and SF, we addressed the question of whether mSF could contribute to cell interaction in these cancers. Investigations on primary cervical carcinomas have been hindered by the fact that the cells do not grow in culture. We report herein the establishment of two cervical carcinoma cell lines, CALO and INBL, that reproduce the pattern of SF/c-Kit expression observed in primary tumor samples. In addition, these cells exhibit marked density-dependent growth much in the same way as AML blasts. Using an antisense strategy with phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides that specifically target SF without affecting other surface markers, we provide direct evidence for a role of mSF and c-Kit in cell interaction and cell survival in these gynecological tumor cell lines as well as in primary AML blasts. Finally, our study defines the importance of juxtacrine stimulation, which may be as important, if not more, than autocrine stimulation in cancers.",

To eliminate some of the methodological problems, a new 1-day FISH method was recently introduced. The aim of our study was to evaluate the utility of the Instant Quality FISH with the conventional FISH kit from the same provider (Dako pharmDx) for determination of HER2 status.

FISH signal stability was also tested by the reassessment of the slides after 2 months storage. The accordance regarding HER2 gene amplification status between the 2 FISH kits tested was 100%. There was an excellent correlation between HER2/CEN17 ratios with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.958 and correlation coefficient (R) of 0.959.

An immunohistochemical survey of p63 expression in normal thyroid and in reactive, neoplastic, and inflammatory thyroid disorders was performed. Sections from routinely fixed and processed archival thyroidectomy specimens were pretreated with citric acid, pH 6.0, for antigen retrieval, then incubated overnight with anti-p63 monoclonal antibody 4A4. Slides were stained using a streptavidin-biotin kit and diaminobenzidine as a chromagen, and then were counterstained with hematoxylin. The results showed that p63 expression was negative in normal thyroid tissue, nodular goiters, and oncocytic follicular adenomas. Positivity was rare and weak in follicular adenomas. p63-positive foci were commonly found in Hashimoto's thyroiditis (1 or more foci in 78.8% of cases), but rare in Graves' disease. Twenty-seven of 33 papillary thyroid carcinomas (81.8%) displayed p63-positive foci. Staining was uncommon in follicular carcinomas and rare in medullary carcinomas. One case of insular carcinoma was p63-positive. All squamoid structures were p63-positive; p63-positive structures morphologically consistent with solid cell nests were also identified. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that p63 is commonly expressed in papillary thyroid carcinoma and in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Given the debated association of papillary thyroid carcinoma with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, it is possible that p63 expression may be a potential pathobiologic link between the two disorders. The finding of p63 in benign squamoid nests supports a possible interrelationship between these structures and both Hashimoto's thyroiditis and papillary carcinoma. The high percentage of papillary carcinomas with p63-positive foci appears to distinguish papillary carcinoma from other neoplasms originating in the thyroid.",

We experienced a 56-year-old man with small cell carcinoma that arose in the liver. Abdominal CT scan showed an 8 cm size, low density mass in the segment 4 of the liver and also multiple lymphadenopathies. Chest X-ray showed no abnormal finding, but the chest CT showed a right lower paratracheal lymphadenopathy. The pathological findings showed nests of small round cells with fine granular chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli and scanty cytoplasm. Distinct and strong immunoreactions were seen for CD56 and c-kit, and sparse immunoreaction was seen for synaptophysin. Thyroid transcription factor-1 showed no immunoreaction. The tumor did not decrease in size despite chemotherapy. We report this case along with a review of the relevant literatures.",

The sera of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma have IgA antibodies to a variety of EBV latent and replicated antigens. Recently, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, combining both the EBV early antigen (EA) and nuclear antigen (EBNA-1) became commercially available. The purpose of this study was to assess its clinical application. Serum IgA antibodies to the EBV EA and EBNA-1 were measured by using the ELISA kit in various groups of subjects. Fluorescence antibody (FA) tests against EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) and EA in the IgA and IgG classes were also studied for comparison. The DNA content analysis was also carried out to investigate the association with IgA antibody titres using ELISA. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the ELISA test were 98.1%, 81.8% and 88.7% respectively. It was far better than any FA tests. The IgA antibody titres showed no association with DNA content analysis. Univariate analysis of various factors revealed that IgA antibody titres were statistically correlated to N stage (P = 0.0291) and M status (P = 0.001). However, there was no association with the age, sex, T stage and clinical stage. Multivariate analysis of various factors was found to be statistically significant in patients with T4 (P = 0.0133), N3 (P = 0.0244) or M1 (P = 0.001) respectively. Serial testing of antibody titres in 22 previously untreated patients found a trend of decreasing IgA antibody titres after initial treatment when the tumours disappeared (P = 0.0358). The ELISA kit to identify specific IgA antibodies with the combination of EBV EA and EBNA-1 recombinant antigens has high sensitivity and acceptable specificity and accuracy in the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

We designed a preclinical study to examine the efficacy of sunitinib alone and in combination with cisplatin against human urothelial carcinoma.;The in vitro activities of sunitinib and cisplatin alone and in combination were determined against human urothelial carcinoma cell lines, TCC-SUP and 5637. Antitumor activities were also determined in vivo against murine subcutaneous 5637 xenografts. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to detect VEGFR2 and Kit, and modulation of proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis.;Both cell lines expressed VEGFR2, but did not express Kit. Sunitinib displayed activity against both cell lines in vitro at low micromolar concentrations, which are not attainable in vivo, and was synergistic with cisplatin. Activity was observed for sunitinib at 20 and 40 mg/kg orally once daily for 4 weeks, which attains low nanomolar concentrations in vivo against murine 5637 xenografts.

It has been speculated that AM might be a precursor of malignancy or an indicator of a susceptibility of the breast tissue to develop neoplasia, mainly based on comparing the frequency of AM in breast cancer and non-breast cancer patients [1]. Studies using comparative genomic hybridization have supported this by showing similar molecular alterations in benign and malignant apocrine lesions [2]. Few studies, however, have compared expression of biomarkers involved in tumor progression in AM and progressively more advanced atypical apocrine lesions. The expression of C-KIT, COX2, CD24, and CD44s was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material of 9 AM, 20 apocrine ductal intraepithelial neoplasia (DIN1c-3) and 40 atypical apocrine lesions (not qualifying for DIN1c-3) and compared to expression of the same biomarkers in adjacent normal ductal epithelium. Of the 66 apocrine lesions, 62 (94 %) did not express C-KIT compared to 4/63 (6 %) of the normal glands (Fisher's exact, p < 0.001). COX2 was expressed in a significantly higher proportion of apocrine lesions than of normal glands (49 vs. 14 %, p < 0.001), and the number of apocrine lesions positive for CD24 was found to be higher with increasing aggressiveness of the lesions (Spearman, p < 0.001). In conclusion, benign and non-invasive proliferative apocrine lesions of the breast display immuno-phenotypical characteristics previously ascribed mainly to malignant transformation. This could lend support to the theory that AM is an early step towards malignant transformation, albeit associated with slow progression to carcinoma. ",

This article reviews the role of immunohistochemistry in the differential diagnosis of the three main categories of ovarian tumors, with emphasis on recently developed antibodies. In the surface epithelial stromal category the most common problem is its discernment from metastasis. The use of differential cytokeratins, primarily CK7 and CK20, as well as Cdx-2, beta-catenin, and P504S in differentiating between metastatic adenocarcinoma, particularly of colorectal origin, and primary ovarian carcinoma is discussed. Dpc4 may be useful in distinguishing pancreatic from ovarian mucinous carcinomas, because up to 55% of pancreatic carcinomas lack Dpc4 expression, whereas the differential expression of mucin genes may be helpful in distinguishing between primary ovarian mucinous and metastatic tumors. Urothelial markers (thrombomodulin and uroplakin III) and renal cell carcinoma markers (CD10 and renal cell carcinoma marker) can be helpful in the diagnosis of metastatic urothelial and renal cell tumors to the ovary.

The aim of this study was to determine whether epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) immunoreactivity correlated with outcomes and to identify new biologic markers for potential targeted therapy. Three markers, EGFR, C-kit, and Her2/neu, were selected for evaluation in patients with advanced thymic epithelial tumors treated on E1C97.;Of the 42 patients entered onto E1C97, 34 patients (World Health Organization [WHO] categories: type A = 1, type AB = 1, type B1 = 10, type B2 = 11 type B3 = 8, and type C = 3) had sufficient tissue available for immunohistologic study. Each tumor was assessed to have 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+ immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm or membranes of the neoplastic cells for Her2/neu and EGFR and for the presence or absence of C-kit immunoreactivity.;EGFR immunoreactivity of 2+ or 3+ was associated with more aggressive thymic tumors (WHO types B2 and B3). However, strong EGFR immunoreactivity was not consistently seen with thymic carcinoma. The presence of EGFR within cells was associated with a significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and a trend for overall survival (OS). Twelve patients demonstrated C-kit immunoreactivity; the lack of C-kit immunoreactivity was significantly associated with superior PFS but not OS. Her2/neu immunoreactivity was uniformly negative for all tumors evaluated. There was no association between response and biomarker status.;High EGFR immunoreactivity is seen in more aggressive thymic neoplasms as classified according to the 2004 WHO, but regardless of classification, the presence of EGFR in tumor cells (1+, 2+, and 3+) is associated with improved performance free survival (PFS) and a trend for better OS. In contrast, the absence of C-kit immunoreactivity was associated with improved PFS. These data suggest that EGFR and C-kit may be prognostic, and further studies of these markers in subcategories of thymic malignancies is warranted.",

To determine the transcriptional programs involved in the transition from normal germ cells to GCT, and to further elucidate genetic differences between seminomas and non-seminomatous GCT the global expression profile of 12 neoplastic and 3 normal testicular tissues were investigated by whole genome cDNA microarrays. Transcriptional differences between seminomas and embryonal carcinomas were determined and gene signatures characterizing histological subtypes of GCT were identified. The most significant difference between seminomas and embryonal carcinomas was the expression of spermatogenesis-associated genes (PRAME, MAGEA4, SPAG1, HPX) in seminomas and regulatory genes DNMT3B and SOX2 as well as small molecular weight keratins KRT8, KRT18 in embryonal carcinomas. The expression of several selected genes (CK18, MAGE-A4, SOX2, DNMT3B, CD30, KIT) was studied by immunohistochemistry or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in a large collective of GCT. In summary, our data identified tumor type-specific gene signatures of GCT and provided new insights into genetic pathways driving the transition to seminomas and embryonal carcinomas from their respective precursor lesions.",

However, the down-regulation of c-kit, which is associated with the mechanism of mobilization, was much greater in the PBPC mobilized by SCF and G-CSF.

ITET is a rare tumor comprising about 0.08% of all primary thyroid malignancies. It is a low-grade thyroid carcinoma with squamous cell differentiation whose overall survival rate was found to be 71%. Lymph node metastasis at surgery was found in 40% and hematogenous metastases developed in bones, liver and lungs. This tumor grows within the thyroid gland and invades into the thyroid parenchyma as well as into the extrathyroid structures. It is a well-circumscribed solid tumor with a sharp tumor border, but is not capsulated. After fixation, the cut surface of the tumor is gray-white in color and is a solid tumor with lobulation. Tumor calcification was not detected in our 15 cases. The tumor cells show solid sheets of growth with occasional keratinization without follicular or papillary structures. Lymphocytic infiltration in the stroma is one of the most characteristic features of this tumor. The tumor cells are polygonal epithelial cells with distinct nucleoli and ill-defined cell border. Positive immunoreactivity for CD5 is a key feature to differentiate it from undifferentiated carcinoma, poorly differentiated carcinoma, medullary (C cell) carcinoma and high-grade squamous cell carcinoma (so-called primary squamous cell carcinoma) of the thyroid. Negative immunoreactivity for calcitonin, TTF1 and thyroglobulin, and positive immunoreactivity for p63 and KIT are also helpful for differential diagnosis. Nuclear atypia is mild and mitoses are less frequent, with an intermediate proliferation index (MIB-1 labeling index is usually less than 20%), which are also helpful to differentiate it from high-grade primary squamous cell carcinoma of the thyroid. The tumors in our 15 cases demonstrate 3 histological subtypes: keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma type, non-keratinizing basaloid cell carcinoma (lymphoepithelioma-like) type and neuroendocrine carcinoma type, which correspond to subtypes of the mediastinal thymic carcinomas.",

Sixty-six colorectal tumor specimens, including 10 invasive carcinomas, 6 mucosal carcinomas and 50 adenomas were evaluated. Ten specimens of normal tissue were also included in the study. Telomerase activity was assayed by semiquantitative fluorescence using the TRAP-eze(TM) telomerase detection kit. Analysis of the expression of each telomerase subunit gene was performed by real-time PCR amplification. There was a positive correlation between histological atypia and telomerase activity (rho = 0.700, p < 0.0001), hTERT mRNA expression (rho = 0.603, p < 0.0001), and hTERC expression (rho = 0.290, p < 0.05). There was also a positive correlation between the levels of hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity (r = 0.455, p < 0.01). Significant differences in the levels of hTERT mRNA were shown between normal tissues and the adenomas (p < 0.05) and between the mucosal carcinomas and invasive carcinomas (p < 0.05). The values of hTERC expression in neoplastic tissues were significantly higher than in the normal tissues; however, there were no significant differences between the adenomas and the carcinomas. In summary, although upregulation of hTERC expression is an early event in adenoma development, hTERT mRNA expression is gradually upregulated during the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and may be a rate-limiting determinant of telomerase activity.",

We studied multiple oncogenic and therapeutic related proteins by immunohistochemistry to identify differences in expression between benign and malignant sebaceous proliferations. A total of 27 cases, including 9 sebaceous adenomas, 4 sebaceomas, 8 sebaceous carcinomas, and 6 cases of sebaceous hyperplasia, were examined by immunohistochemistry, with antibodies directed against Ki-67 (MIB-1), bcl-2, p53, p21WAF1, p27Kip1, c-erbB-2 (Her-2/neu), CD117 (c-kit), cyclin D1, MDM2, CD99, MLH-1, and MSH-2. We found that sebaceous adenomas and sebaceomas stained like sebaceous hyperplasia did, whereas carcinomas had statistically significantly increased levels of p53 (50% versus 11%, respectively) and Ki-67 (30% versus 10%). The carcinomas also had significantly reduced levels of bcl-2 (7% versus 56%, respectively) and p21 (16% versus 34%) compared to the adenomas. Thus, a combination of several of these markers may be diagnostically useful in challenging cases. In addition, we found little or no Her-2/neu and CD117 staining, indicating that immunotherapy with Herceptin or Gleevac would likely not be useful for sebaceous carcinomas.

Previous studies of SCF in neuroblastoma have produced conflicting conclusions. To explore the role of SCF in neuroblastoma, we studied five neuroblastoma lines (IMR-5, SK-N-SH, SK-N-BE, AF8, and SJ-N-KP) and the neuroepithelioma line CHP-100. All lines expressed mRNA for c-kit and c-kit protein at low intensity as measured by flow cytometry, and secreted SCF in medium culture as shown by ELISA. Exogenous SCF did not modify 3H thymidine uptake in the neuroblastoma and neuroepithelioma cell lines. After 6 days' culture in the presence of anti-c-kit, the number of viable neuroblastoma cells was significantly lower than the control, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay showed a substantial increase of apoptotic cells: The percentage of positive cells was 1-3% in the control lines, whereas in the presence of anti c-kit it varied from 29% of SK-N-BE to 92% of CHP-100. After 9 days' culture in the presence of anti-c-kit, no viable cells were detectable. These data indicate that SCF is produced by some neuroblastoma cell lines via an autocrine loop to protect them from apoptosis.",

It has been reported that the DCP ratio defined by DCP measured by MU-3 antibody/DCP measured by 19B7 antibody demonstrated differences between hepatocellular carcinoma and vitamin K deficiency. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between the DCP ratio and tumour malignancy, as well as the prognostic significance of the DCP ratio after hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma.;From January 1996 to December 1999, 79 patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent hepatectomy. To detect DCP in the plasma before surgery, we used a new EIA kit, Eitest PIVKA-II kit (Eisai, Tokyo, Japan) with both MU-3 and 19B7 antibody. The DCP ratio was calculated using the formula: DCP ratio = DCP level measured by MU-3 antibody (mAU/ml)/DCP level measured by 19B7 antibody (mAU/ml). Pathologic findings using resected specimens were classified according to the Japanese General Rules for Primary Liver Cancer.;Among DCP-positive patients, the DCP ratio was significantly higher in those with tumour thrombus in the portal vein (vp) or with a moderately or poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma than in those without vp or with a well-differentiated carcinoma (P = 0.0162, 0.0109, respectively). Patients with DCP ratio > 3 had a significantly higher incidence of vp than those with DCP ratio < or = 3 (P = 0.0027). The survival rate was significantly higher in patients with DCP ratio < or = 3 than in those with DCP ratio > 3 (P = 0.0002). This result was the same as in DCP positive cases (P = 0.0027).;The DCP ratio can distinguish DCP produced by hepatoma cells from DCP produced by normal hepatocytes in vitamin K deficiency. The DCP ratio is a useful prognostic indicator that can be assessed before hepatectomy.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC) is a recently recognized form of inherited kidney cancer characterized by a predisposition to develop multiple, bilateral papillary renal tumours. The pattern of inheritance of HPRC is consistent with autosomal dominant transmission with reduced penetrance. HPRC is histologically and genetically distinct from two other causes of inherited renal carcinoma, von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) and the chromosome translocation (3;8). Malignant papillary renal carcinomas are characterized by trisomy of chromosomes 7, 16 and 17, and in men, by loss of the Y chromosome. Inherited and sporadic clear cell renal carcinomas are characterized by inactivation of both copies of the VHL gene by mutation, and/or by hypermethylation. We found that the HPRC gene was located at chromosome 7q31.1-34 in a 27-centimorgan (cM) interval between D7S496 and D7S1837. We identified missense mutations located in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET gene in the germline of affected members of HPRC families and in a subset of sporadic papillary renal carcinomas. Three mutations in the MET gene are located in codons that are homologous to those in c-kit and RET, proto-oncogenes that are targets of naturally-occurring mutations. The results suggest that missense mutations located in the MET proto-oncogene lead to constitutive activation of the MET protein and papillary renal carcinomas.",

The aim of this study was to determine the phenotypic class (ie luminal A/B, ERBB2, basal-like) of secretory breast carcinoma. A series of six secretory breast carcinomas were identified in our files. The ETV6 rearrangement was confirmed in all cases by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Immunophenotype was assessed with anti-ER, PR, ERBB2, KIT, EGFR, E-cadherin, vimentin, PS100, smooth muscle actin, basal (CK5/6 and 14), luminal cytokeratins (CK8/18) and p63 antibodies. In situ and invasive components shared the same immunoprofile and were ER, PR, ERBB2 negative with expression of basal cytokeratins. ETV6 gene alterations were present in both in situ and invasive components, highlighting their genetic similarities. The immunoprofile data (triple-negative with expression of basal markers) showed that secretory breast carcinomas with ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene belong to the phenotypic basal-like spectrum of breast carcinomas. These results support the hypothesis that secretory breast carcinomas have immunohistochemical and genetic features that distinguish them from other basal-like tumors of the breast.",

In this study, p63 expression was examined in benign lung and in neoplasms of pulmonary origin. Eighty sections from routinely fixed and processed archival bronchoscopic biopsy or lobectomy specimens were pretreated with citric acid (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval, then incubated overnight with anti-p63 monoclonal antibody 4A4. Slides were stained using a streptavidin-biotin kit and diaminobenzidine as chromagen, and were counterstained with hematoxylin. In normal lung, p63 intensely stained nuclei of bronchial reserve cells but did not stain ciliated cells, alveolar epithelial cells, or nonepithelial cells. The lower strata of squamous metaplastic bronchial epithelium stained positively. All squamous-cell carcinomas stained positively (n = 30). In some well-differentiated carcinomas, staining was found at the periphery of tumor nests but was negative in central zones showing squamous maturation. Poorly differentiated carcinomas showed very high proportions (80% to 100%) of p63-positive nuclei. All small-cell carcinomas were p63 negative (n = 9). Staining of bronchioloalveolar carcinomas (n = 7) and adenocarcinomas (n = 23) was variable: some tumors showed no detectable staining, others showed heterogeneously positive staining. Adenosquamous carcinomas (n = 5) displayed a unique basalar staining pattern. Carcinoid tumors were almost entirely negative (n = 5). We conclude that p63 is expressed in benign bronchial stem cells, in neoplastic cells with either squamous differentiation or squamous differentiating potential, and in a subpopulation of adenocarcinomas. p63 immunostaining may also aid in some histopathologic distinctions, such as in small biopsies where the differential diagnosis is poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma versus small-cell carcinoma.

We studied 64 cases with immunohistochemistry, using 23 antibodies, to characterize diverse pathological pathways. A basal cytokeratin was identified in 81% of tumors and vimentin was identified in 55%. The mean Ki67 index was 46% (range, 10-90%). Coincident expression of p50 and p65, which suggests an active nuclear factor-kappaB factor, was present in 13% of neoplasms. Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) or c-kit (CD117) was identified in 77% of tumors. Loss of protein tyrosine phosphatase was found in 14%, whereas Akt activation was present in 28%. Several differences were identified between two subtypes of basal breast carcinomas: the pure variant (negative S-100 and actin) was more frequently associated with 'in situ carcinoma' (P=0.019) and pBad overexpression (P=0.098), whereas the myoepithelial variant (positive S-100 or actin) showed more frequent tumor necrosis (P=0.048), vimentin expression (P=0.0001), CD117 expression (P=0.001) and activated caspase-3 (P=0.089). IGF-IR could be as important as EGFR for the growth of these neoplasms. Basal cell carcinoma has at least two subtypes with distinct microscopic and immunohistochemical features.",

We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of these markers in different testicular germ cell tumors, and their utility in the differential diagnosis of morphologically difficult-to-classify components of these tumors. A total of 50 mixed testicular germ cell tumors, 43 also containing difficult-to-classify areas, were studied. In these areas, multiple morphological parameters were noted, and high-grade nuclear details similar to typical embryonal carcinoma were considered 'embryonal carcinoma-like high-grade'. Immunohistochemical staining for OCT3/4, c-kit, CD30, SOX2, and GDF3 was performed and graded in each component as 0, negative; 1+, 1-25%; 2+, 26-50%; and 3+, >50% positive staining cells. The different components identified in these tumors were seminoma (8), embryonal carcinoma (50), yolk sac tumor (40), teratoma (40), choriocarcinoma (3) and intra-tubular germ cell neoplasia, unclassified (35). By immunohistochemistry, the staining patterns were OCT3/4 -3+, all seminomas, embryonal carcinomas and intra-tubular germ cell neoplasia; SOX2 -3+, all embryonal carcinomas and -2 to 3+, 11/14 (79%) primitive neuroectodermal components in immature teratomas; GDF3 -2 to 3+, all yolk sac tumors, seminomas and intra-tubular germ cell neoplasia and 1 to 2+, 40/50 embryonal carcinomas. A total of 34/43 (79%) of difficult-to-classify areas stained 3+ for OCT3/4, CD30, and SOX2, similar to embryonal carcinoma. Among these areas, only 'embryonal carcinoma-like high-grade' nuclear details were significantly associated with such an immunophenotype. Thus, SOX2 is expressed in embryonal carcinoma and primitive neuroectoderm of teratoma, and unlike OCT3/4, not in intra-tubular germ cell neoplasia and seminoma. Therefore, it may be useful in the distinction of seminoma from embryonal carcinoma, and potentially in diagnosing early carcinomatous differentiation in seminoma. GDF3 positivity, in the absence of OCT3/4 and CD30, combined with morphological features, is helpful in the diagnosis of yolk sac tumor. 'Embryonal carcinoma-like high-grade' nuclear details are the most important morphological criterion for the diagnosis of embryonal carcinoma in difficult-to-classify areas.",

In our previous study a population of c-Kit-(CD45/TER119)- liver stem/progenitor cells in mouse fetal liver, was successfully sorted with large amount (10(6)-10(7)) by using immuno-magnetic microbeads. In this study, the sorted liver stem/progenitor cells were used for proteomic study. Proteins of the sorted liver stem/progenitor cells and unsorted fetal liver cells were investigated using two-dimensional electrophoresis. A two-dimensional proteome map of liver stem/progenitor cells was obtained for the first time. Proteins that exhibited significantly upregulation in liver stem/progenitor cells were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting and peptide sequencing. Nineteen protein spots corresponding to 12 different proteins were identified as showing significant upregulation in liver stem/progenitor cells and seem to play important roles in such cells in cell metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and stress. An interesting finding is that most of the upregulated proteins were overexpressed in various cancers (11 of 12, including 6 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) and involved in cancer development as reported in previous studies. Some of the identified proteins were validated by real-time PCR, Western blotting, and immunostaining. Taken together, the data presented provide a significant new protein-level insight into the biology of liver stem/progenitor cells, a key population of cells that might be also involved in liver cancer development.",

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 (IMATINIB MESYLATE; GLEEVEC; GLIVEC) is a case in point as it has shown promise in the treatment of malignancies expressing the BCR/ABL fusion protein. In addition to BCR/ABL, STI571 inhibits the tyrosine kinase moieties of several cell surface receptors including the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors and c-Kit. Previous work demonstrated that c-Kit activation supports migration, invasion and, survival of certain colorectal carcinoma cells including DLD-1. Here we describe that blocking c-Kit with STI571 inhibits these malignant traits not only in DLD-1 cells but also in two early passage colorectal carcinoma cell strains. Specifically, STI571 inhibited anchorage-independent colony formation and cell scattering in semi-solid medium. Furthermore, it enhanced apoptosis susceptibility and abrogated invasion of DLD-1 cells through Matrigel. In addition, STI571 treatment affected the balance of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators on favor of a pro-apoptotic phenotype. Specifically, STI571 treatment of DLD-1 cells was associated with lower levels of Bcl-2 expression accompanied by de novo expression of Bcl-xS. Finally, STI571 acted as a chemosensitizing agent in DLD-1 cells when used in combination with 5-fluorouracil.",

There was a 0IIa+IIc type tumor 2.0 x1.5 cm in size in the gastric angle of the lesser curvature according to the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma (JCGC). Histologically, the lesion extended no deeper than the muscularis mucosae. The cancer stage was so early that no metastasis was expected to occur but a lymph node with metastasis was found in one lymph node along the common anterior hepatic artery (station No.8a). This histological type was a little different from that of a primary tumor. The doctor began to suspect that the lymph node with metastasis might have been from another patient by mistake. Therefore, DNA typing using the AmpFlSTR Identifiler kit was performed in formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues: 2 parts of gastric mucosa without cancer, one part of gastric mucosa with cancer, 4 lymph nodes without metastasis, and the lymph node station No.8a with metastasis. STR typing was successful in 6~14 STR loci and amelogenin gene, and the detected STR type was the same in all samples. Compared with the STR type using DNA from the patient's blood, the lymph node station No.8a was from the same patient. The lymph node with metastasis turned out to be not from another patient.

Although several lung adenocarcinoma cell lines were shown to repress anoikis through the activation of Src, it remains unknown whether Src actually plays a crucial role in anoikis resistance in lung adenocarcinoma tissues. We examined 20 human lung adenocarcinoma tissues with lymphatic permeation and nine cell lines to investigate whether intralymphatic floating carcinoma cells in the tissues, used as an in vivo model of anoikis resistance, actually suppressed anoikis and whether cell lines in suspension culture, an in vitro model of anoikis resistance, survived through Src activation. We observed that the intralymphatic carcinoma cells aggregated tightly to form nests expressing E-cadherin and phosphorylated Src (p-Src). The apoptotic indices of these cells were comparable to those of extracellular matrix adhesive cells in all tissues, indicating that the intralymphatic cells actually evaded anoikis. Next, we found that the nine cell lines in suspension aggregated loosely (five cell lines) or tightly (four cell lines), and all cells resisted anoikis. Upon detachment, four cell lines (LC-KJ, HCC827, H1650, and H1975) formed compact spheroids that expressed E-cadherin and p-Src. The spheroids were similar to intralymphatic tumour nests and were thus considered to be a suitable model of the nests. The spheroids of the four cell lines underwent apoptosis after treatment with the Src/Abl/Kit inhibitor PP1 or Src/Abl inhibitor bosutinib. On the other hand, the Abl/Kit inhibitor imatinib did not affect cell growth or apoptosis in the four types of spheroids. These results indicate that Src, but not Abl or Kit, plays an essential role in the development of anoikis resistance in lung adenocarcinomas.",

Thymic diseases only accounted for 0.057% of biopsies in the Guangzhou area. Thymic tumor and hyperplasia accounted for 74.7% and 18.6% in thymic diseases respectively. Thymic lymphoepithelimoa-like carcinoma (LELC) occurred in 2.7% of thymic tumors. 2. EBV encoded products (EBERs, EBNA-1 and LMP-1) were not detected in 50 thymic disease specimens. 3. Marked proliferation (3+-4+) grade thymomas (0/18 cases) was much lower than that of thymic carcinomas (10/20 cases), and the marked apoptotic (2+-4+) grade was higher in thymomas (15/18) than the thymic carcinomas (13/20). 4. The p53 protein accumulation rate in thymic carcinomas (8/20) was significantly higher than that of thymomas (1/18). The apoptotic grade is significantly related to p53 accumulation in thymic epithelial tumors. 5. The bcl-2 over expression could be detected both in thymomas and thymic carcinomas.;1. Thymic diseases, including thymic LELC, is very rare in Guangzhou and is not closely associated with EBV infection. 2. Thymic carcinomas have a relatively rapid growth rate compared to thymomas. 3. p53 gene mutation may play an important role in the carcinogenesis of thymic carcinoma, and bcl-2 over-expression may also be involved in the evolution of thymic epithelial tumors. 4. Wild type p53 protein may exert an apoptosis-inducing function in thymic epithelial tumors, including thymomas and carcinomas, and a proliferation inhibiting function only in thymomas.",

HER2 gene status determines the eligibility of breast cancer patients for trastuzumab therapy and a large fraction (41-56%) of these patients respond to targeted therapy. Several studies have related the increased expression of HER2 to an increased copy number of chromosome 17, rather than amplification of the HER2 gene. We compared the results of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization in both invasive ductal and invasive lobular carcinomas, to determine the frequency of chromosome 17 aneuploidy associated with discordant results. In total, 390 invasive ductal carcinomas and 180 invasive lobular carcinomas diagnosed from January 2000 to December 2005 were included in the study only if results were available for immunohistochemistry (HercepTest; DAKO, Carpinteria, California) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (PathVysion HER2 DNA Probe Kit; Abbott Laboratories, Des Plaines, Illinois). Tumors classified as invasive ductal carcinomas were graded according to the Bloom-Richardson grading system. Correlation between the results of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed for all categories. Among invasive ductal carcinomas, 29% (115/390) showed chromosome 17 aneuploidy, mostly associated with grade 3/HER2 2+ (45%) or grade 2/HER2 3+ (55%) that were not amplified. Also, 34% (12/35) of invasive lobular carcinomas showed chromosome 17 aneuploidy; approximately one-third of these cases were HER2 2+ (33%) and HER2 3+ (37%) that were not amplified. Discordance between the results of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization in both ductal and lobular carcinomas is largely associated with chromosome 17 aneuploidy. ",

The aim of the present study is to investigate the expression of EGFR, p-AKT, and COX-2 and the mutation of PIK3CA in distal EBD carcinoma and evaluate the association with clinicopathological factors. Ninety cases of distal extrahepatic bile duct (EBD) carcinoma specimens were studied. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) using antibodies against EGFR, p-AKT, and COX-2 was performed on TMA blocks. The PIK3CA mutation was evaluated using the PNAClamp Detection Kit from DNA samples extracted from formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue. EGFR expression of distal EBD carcinomas was 61.9%, 26.2%, 6.0% and 6.0% in the negative, weakly positive, moderately positive, and strongly positive groups, respectively. Positive EGFR expression showed significant relationships with high T stage (p = 0.024). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, EGFR expression was associated with shorter cancer-specific overall survival (p = 0.005). Multivariate analysis also showed that moderate or strong (2+ or 3+) EGFR expression was a significant prognostic factor in distal EBD carcinoma: HR 5.286; p = 0.001. Ninety cases of EBD carcinoma tissue were analysed for hotspot mutations (exon 9 and 20) in the PIK3CA gene. Only one mutation was detected: a missense mutation of H1047 at exon 20. The expression levels of p-AKT and COX-2 showed no association with any clinicopathological parameters, including survival rate. Moderate and strong EGFR expressions demonstrate a direct link to poor prognosis. Although further study is warranted to understand the clinicopathological significance, our finding suggests EGFR is a useful prognostic marker of patients with distal EBD carcinoma. A low prevalence of PIK3CA mutation exists in the distal EBD carcinoma of Korean patients, indicating that mutation screening may not be useful in determining prognosis or in formulating a treatment response to targeted inhibition in Korea.

One hypothesis suggests that the somatic stem cells of the liver, the so-called oval cells, may undergo malignant transformation. Oval cells are derived from the biliary cells of the canal of Hering and are characterized by c-kit-positivity, the transmembrane receptor of stem cell factor. Constitutively activated tyrosine kinases have been identified as major pathogenetic mechanisms in the development of malignant diseases like gastrointestinal stromal tumors (c-kit) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (bcr-abl). The prognosis of these diseases improved enormously since the drug imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of c-kit and bcr-abl, was introduced.

The paraffin-embedded tissues were sliced into 4-microm-thick sections and analyzed for HER2 protein expression levels by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using an automated slide-staining IHC system. Breast carcinoma tissues were included in every staining batch as positive control. In order to detect and quantify amplification of the HER2, the authors performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using PathVysion HER2 DNA Probe Kit. The IHC results were independently recorded by two pathologists using the standard HER2 scoring system for gastric carcinoma. FISH results were interpreted using standard guideline as employed in breast carcinoma. The two-tailed-Fisher's exact test was used to assess the concordance between IHC and FISH results.;HER2 protein overexpression level was identified in 9% (20 in 224 cases) of the gastric tumors; 80% of which were well or moderately differentiated and of the intestinal or mixed type. However HER2-overexpressing tumors comprised only 16% of the intestinal/mixed-type or well/moderately differentiated tumors. There was no signal obtained from 29 specimens from FISH studies. Thus, the overall results of IHC and FISH methods were concordant in 88% (171 out of 195, p < 0.001).;There is a significant concordance rate between IHC and FISH in gastric carcinoma.

A 48-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital complaining of mild paresis of left leg. Brain CT and MRI showed a solitary tumor (2 cm) with features of cavernous hemangioma in the right temporal lobe. Tumorectomy was performed, and it was pathologically undifferentiated carcinoma. An immunohistochemical analysis reveled that the carcinoma cells were positive for four types of pancytokeratin, cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, CK7, CK18, CK19, p63, and Ki-67 (78%). They were negative for high molecular weight CK, CK14, CK20, TTF-1, PE-10, melanosome, S100 protein, EMA, vimentin, CD34, myoglobin, CEA, p53, desmin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, chromogranin, synaptophysin, CD56, neuron-specific enolase, CD68, KIT, and PDGFRA. The positive CK7 and negative CK20 suggested lung origin, and cytokeratin profiles and positive CK5/6 and p63 suggested a squamous differentiation. The pathological diagnosis was undifferentiated carcinoma with squamous differentiation probably of lung origin. Later, systemic CT, MRI and PET were performed, and they detected a small lung tumor (8 mm) in the right apex. The lung biopsy revealed an undifferentiated carcinoma with focal squamous differentiation; the immunohistochemical findings were the same as those of the brain tumor. These findings suggest that occult very small lung carcinoma can metastasize to brain and such a metastasis may mimic cavernous hemangioma radiologically. Pathologic observations using many antibodies are very useful to determine the origin and histological type in solitary brain nodule.",

In rodents, its homologous gene, ADIP, plays an important role in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration, underlying its potential role in promoting metastasis of other cancers.;To investigate the correlation between the expression level of SSX2IP and the clinicopathologic factors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 53 cases were studied by qPCR and statisted. To directly testing SSX2IP's contribution to HCC in animal models, 45 nude mice were enrolled in peritoneal spreading and liver metastasis models. For the migration and invasion assays, cell culture experiments were performed using QCMTM 24-Well Colorimetric Migration Assay Kit and Cell Invasion Assay Kit (Millipore). Moreover we examined the influence of SSX2IP overexpression on the chemosensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to two most common chemotherapy drugs (5-Fu and CDDP) using Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). The chemotherapeutic drugs sensitivity was evaluated by IC50 parameter.;Statistical analysis of clinical cases revealed that the SSX2IP high expression group had inclinations towards larger tumor size, more tumor thrombus and shorter survival period, implying a strong correlation between the expression level of SSX2IP and HCC tumorigenesis. Consistently in abdominal cavity metastasis and liver metastasis models of immune-deficient mice, SSX2IP was able to promote the metastasis of hepatoma cells. At the cytological level, SSX2IP stimulates the wound healing, metastasis and invasion of hepatoma cells, and reduces the sensitivity of hepatoma cells to 5-Fu and CDDP.;Our results showed that SSX2IP promotes the development and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma and contributes to the drug resistance of hepatoma cells, suggesting that SSX2IP is expected to become a new diagnostic and prognostic marker and a new target of the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.",

Further, prolactin amplimer was sequenced.;Preoperative prolactin and carcinoembryonic antigen levels were significantly higher in patients with colorectal carcinoma than in controls (prolactin, P = 0.001; carcinoembryonic antigen, P = 0.0001). Univariate survival analysis showed that Dukes stage, histologic grade, and circulating prolactin were significant prognostic factors for determining overall survival (Dukes stage, P = 0.00001; histologic grade, P = 0.005; prolactin, P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, besides Dukes stage, circulating prolactin emerged as the most significant independent prognostic factor influencing overall survival. Preoperative prolactin levels showed excellent significant correlation with response to therapy and progression of disease. A significant tenfold higher mean concentration of prolactin was observed in tumor-draining venous blood than in peripheral blood (P = 0.0001). Diffuse cytoplasmic staining for prolactin was seen in 51 percent (50/98) of the colorectal carcinomas.

Sequence analysis of the 234-bp prolactin amplimer revealed that the sequence was homologous to exon 5 of pituitary prolactin messenger ribonucleic acid.;These multiple approaches confirmed that prolactin is produced by colorectal carcinoma cells.

Other markers were expressed at various levels in these tumors, but the difference between them was not significant. Eighteen MBC and 8 CAC cases were triple (ER/PR/HER2) negative; 17 MBCs and 7 CACs were basal-like tumors. Several differences were seen in MBCs and CACs, but they were heterogeneous, differentiating multipotentially into mesenchymal, myoepithelial, basal-like phenotypes with \"stem cell-like\" features. Thus, CACs are related to MBCs by immunohistochemical analyses as well as according to morphological findings.",

This marker is determined in the urine of cancer patients and is considered to be particularly specific for ovarian carcinomas. The purpose of our study was to assess the specificity of UGP in a variety of malignancies other than ovarian carcinomas, e.g., breast, colonic, lung, and urogenital tumors (n = 50 each). The tumors were compared with benign lesions of the same organs. Urine samples of 50 healthy donors served as controls. The 450 urine samples were tested in duplicate using the UGP EIA-kit from Ciba Corning Diagnostics. All tumors were staged and histologically classified. For normalization in all samples, creatinine levels were determined. UGP was found in all tested tumors, however, with very low sensitivity of 20% in urogenital tumors, 46% in lung, and 30% or 27% in colon and breast carcinomas, respectively. The specificity of UGP was comprised between 100% (breast) and 88%. Clearly elevated UGP-concentrations were seen in postmenopausal women. A comparison of UGP with the optimal markers for each tumor system showed that UGP is not superior to these markers.

Few studies showed that neither DNA-index nor ploidy is an independent prognostic indicator, and there is no correlation with clinical outcome. The S-phase fraction (SPF) has been shown to be useful prognostic factor in both node-negative and node-positive tumors. The present work was done to find a correlation between sFas, tissue FasL, ploidy and SPF with prognostic factors and survival of breast ductal carcinoma patients. The present study included two groups; a patients group comprised 30 patients with breast ductal carcinoma and a control group that comprised 15 patients with benign breast swellings. Serum sFas was measured using commercially available ELISA kit and tissue FasL expression was studied using avidin-biotine immunohistochemical staining technique. Cell cycle studies were performed using flow cytometry. Serum sFas was significantly higher in breast ductal carcinoma group than in the benign breast swelling control group. A significant negative correlation between serum sFas and overall survival was found. Tissue FasL expression was directly correlated with distant metastasis and poor overall survival.

The relation between the positivity of serum anti-p53 antibodies and p53 abnormal staining of gastric carcinoma tissues was examined. Clinicopathologic characteristics and prognoses of these patients were given attention.;Anti-p53 antibodies were detected in 19.2%(23 of 120) of these patients with gastric carcinoma. Among those who were positive for anti-p53 antibodies, female patients were predominant, the depth of invasion was greater, and liver metastasis was present, as compared with those who were negative for anti-p53 antibodies. Regarding other factors, there were no differences between those who were positive or negative for anti-p53 antibodies. Gastric carcinoma tissues had a 60.9% (14 of 23) positivity rate of p53 staining with anti-p53 antibodies and a 33.0% (32 of 97) negativity rate, and this difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05).

Thus, differentiating a primary cutaneous process from a metastatic breast carcinoma can be nearly impossible. In all, 10-34% of breast carcinomas overexpress HER-2 protein, a membrane-associated protein that functions in cell differentiation, adhesion and motility. As expression of this gene in cutaneous neoplasms has not been well characterized, we sought to determine HER-2 expression in a sample of benign and malignant cutaneous eccrine and apocrine neoplasms and to determine if there is value in using this protein expression in differentiating primary cutaneous from metastatic breast lesions. Totally, 85 primary cutaneous neoplasms and 11 cutaneous metastases from HER-2-positive breast carcinomas were retrieved from archived material at our institute. All cases were evaluated for HER-2 protein expression using the Dako Hercept Test kit. Membranous HER-2 staining was noted in three of the 85 cutaneous adnexal neoplasms: one hidrocystoma and two nodular hidradenomas. Seven of the 11 cutaneous metastases from HER-2-positive breast carcinomas maintained moderate-to-strong HER-2 expression. In conclusion, while 10-34% of breast carcinomas overexpress the HER-2 protein, only 3.5% of cutaneous apocrine and eccrine neoplasms in this study stained with the HER-2 antibody. These HER-2-positive cutaneous neoplasms typically do not pose a diagnostic dilemma in the setting of differentiation from breast metastasis. Additionally, although histologically these breast and cutaneous lesions may have morphologic similarities, the relative lack of HER-2 overexpression suggests that they are different nosologically. Finally, this study suggests that HER-2 protein expression can be a useful tool in differentiating a primary cutaneous appendageal neoplasm from HER-2 expressing metastatic breast carcinoma.",

The neoplastic epithelial cells were reactive with colloidal iron staining; Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, peanut agglutinin, and Ulex europaeus agglutinin I lectins; and cluster of differentiation 10 and c-KIT antigens but not for periodic acid-Schiff or vimentin stain. Neoplastic sarcomatoid cells stained positive for vimentin. Because these histopathologic features are identical to those of human chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, the present case was diagnosed as canine chromophobe renal cell carcinoma.",

Semenogelins, the major protein constituents of semen coagulum, are the most effective markers for semen detection. Recently, it has been demonstrated that semenogelins are also ectopically expressed in small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) and in a minority of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). This finding prompted us to look for semenogelin expression in the serum of lung cancer patients. A set of 13 serum samples (3 from SCLC and 10 from NSCLC patients) was screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using a commercially available kit. Four of the NSCLC cases showed positive results. Ectopic expression of marker proteins in individuals affected by cancer could represent a potential source of forensic pitfalls.",

Animal modeling of this disease has been challenging, with species- and strain-specific differences in organ biology and CFTR function influencing the emergence of disease pathology. Here, we report the phenotype of a CFTR-knockout ferret model of CF. Neonatal CFTR-knockout ferrets demonstrated many of the characteristics of human CF disease, including defective airway chloride transport and submucosal gland fluid secretion; variably penetrant meconium ileus (MI); pancreatic, liver, and vas deferens disease; and a predisposition to lung infection in the early postnatal period. Severe malabsorption by the gastrointestinal (GI) tract was the primary cause of death in CFTR-knockout kits that escaped MI. Elevated liver function tests in CFTR-knockout kits were corrected by oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid, and the addition of an oral proton-pump inhibitor improved weight gain and survival. To overcome the limitations imposed by the severe intestinal phenotype, we cloned 4 gut-corrected transgenic CFTR-knockout kits that expressed ferret CFTR specifically in the intestine. One clone passed feces normally and demonstrated no detectable ferret CFTR expression in the lung or liver. The animals described in this study are likely to be useful tools for dissecting CF disease pathogenesis and developing treatments.",

An 84-year-old man consulted our hospital because of epigastralgia and weakness. Blood test showed anemia and increased CA19-9 (233 U/ml). Endoscopic examination revealed a large Borrmann type III tumor measuring 6x8 cm in the stomach. Biopsies from the tumor revealed typical small cell carcinoma with very scant cytoplasm, hyperchromatic nuclei, absent nucleoli, molded nuclei, and increased nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for pancytokeratin (PCK) WSS, PCK MNF-116, PCK AE1/3, PCK CAM5.2, cytokeratin (CK) 34BE12, CK 5/6, CK7, CK8, CK18, vimentin, EMA, KIT (CD117), CD56, synaptophysin, chromogranin, NSE, CA19-9, CEA, p53 protein, and Ki67 antigen (Ki-67 labeling = 60%). The tumor cells were negative for CK14, CK19, CK20, PDGFRA, CD45, CD45RO, CD3, CD20, CD30, and CD79a. A retrospective genetic analysis using PCR-direct sequencing method in paraffin sections identified no mutations of KIT (exons 9, 11, 13 and 17) and PDGFRA (exons 12 and 18) genes.

The underlying mechanisms were suggested to include cell cycle arrest, cell signaling inhibition and downregulation of the androgen receptor. The present study demonstrated that DIM induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by downregulating the activity of telomerase. The nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line 5‑8F was selected for this purpose. A cell counting kit‑8 assay and flow cytometry were performed to detect apoptosis and proliferation of 5‑8F cells, respectively, which revealed the pro‑apoptotic and anti‑proliferative effects of DIM. Telomerase activity was detected using a telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay, which revealed that the telomerase activity was inhibited by DIM in a dose‑dependent manner. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the mRNA expression levels of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and human telomerase RNA (hTR), and western blot analysis was used to detect the protein expression of hTERT. The results showed that the mRNA and protein expression of hTERT were downregulated in 5‑8F cells following treatment with DIM; however, the mRNA expression of hTR remained unchanged, suggesting that hTERT was the target of DIM. To further identify the target, the length of telomeres was continually measured using a telomere length detection kit, revealing that the telomeres were shortened by DIM in an concentration‑dependent manner. The present study confirmed that DIM had pro‑apoptotic and anti‑proliferative effects in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by regulating telomerase.",

Because of the paucity of reported cases, the clinical behavior, molecular alterations, and potential therapies for this malignancy are not well understood. Eight cases of sarcomatoid carcinoma involving the upper urinary tract were studied. Clinicopathologic characteristics were reviewed. Immunohistochemical expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu, c-kit, and p53 was analyzed in each case. Evaluation for amplification of EGFR and HER2 genes was performed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Each tumor was also examined for gains of chromosomes 3, 7, and 17 and for loss of chromosome 9p21 by UroVysion FISH (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL). The patients we studied were 5 females and 3 males, ranging in age from 56 to 78 years (mean age, 69 years). Presenting symptoms included gross hematuria, flank mass, urinary obstruction, fever, or sepsis. Radical nephroureterectomy was performed on all patients. Tumor size ranged from 2 to 13 cm. Coexisting urothelial carcinoma was present in all 8 cases. Heterologous osteosarcoma was identified in 2 cases. Pathologic stage was pT4 in 5 cases and pT3 in 3 cases. Lymph node metastases were present in 5 patients at the time of surgery. Of 8 patients, 7 died within 2 years after surgery. EGFR immunostaining had moderately to strongly positive results in 6 of 8 cases. Both HER2/neu and c-kit immunostaining had negative results in all cases. p53 immunostaining had positive results in 5 of 8 cases. The EGFR polysomy was demonstrated in 7 of 8 cases. No amplification of HER2/neu was present in any case. UroVysion FISH showed abnormalities typical of urothelial carcinoma in all 8 cases. In conclusion, the prognosis of sarcomatoid carcinoma of the upper urinary tract is extremely poor, most patients died within 2 years (7/8 patients). Gains of chromosome 3, 7, and 17 and loss of chromosome 9p21 were commonly observed in these tumors.

This article reports the results of a study of serum fragment CYFRA 21-1, measured by immunoradiometric assay, as a marker of lung cancer.;One hundred fourteen patients with primary lung cancer, 6 patients with malignant solid tumor, 116 patients with a variety of benign diseases, and 29 normal individuals were entered into the study. Serum CYFRA 21-1 levels were obtained by means of immunoradiometric assay using the CYFRA 21-1 EIA (enzyme immunoassay) kit. In addition, we studied other tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC), and neuron specific enolase (NSE), as a means of lung cancer diagnosis.;The diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity of serum CYFRA 21-1 for the detection of lung cancer were highest among the four markers. The serum CYFRA 21-1 levels were most highly elevated in lung carcinoma patients (in particular UICC Stage IV patients) across different histologic types and attained 85.1% sensitivity when using a threshold of 3.5 ng/mL. The diagnostic sensitivity for detecting lung carcinoma was substantially enhanced by means of combined assays of CYFRA 21-1 with CEA overall for lung cancer, with SCC for squamous cell carcinoma, and with CEA for adenocarcinoma.;These findings suggest that serum assays of CYFRA 21-1 are clinically useful for the diagnosis of lung carcinoma.",

The clinical values of PSA, PSA-ACT, the free PSA to total PSA ratio (F/T ratio), the free PSA to PSA-ACT ratio, PSA density (PSAD), and PSA-ACT density (ACTD) were compared by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.;Biopsy yielded no evidence of malignancy in 198 patients, and prostate carcinoma was confirmed in 83 patients. ROC analysis demonstrated that the area under the curve (AUC) for PSA-ACT was greater than that for total PSA and was equivalent to that for the F/T ratio in both groups of patients (PSA ranges of 4.1-20.0 ng/mL and 4.1-10.0 ng/mL, respectively). The AUC for the ACTD was greater than the AUC for the PSAD and had the highest value of all parameters.;The measurement of PSA-ACT represents an alternative to the use of total and free PSA. The ACTD value is the most useful for discriminating between BPH and prostate carcinoma.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of CD117 in normal, inflammatory, neoplastic, and reactive lesions of the thyroid. Using polyclonal anti-CD117 antibody, we performed immunohistochemical staining on tissue blocks from 230 cases obtained from the archives of the Department of Pathology, Ondokuz Mayis University (Samsun, Turkey), collected between 1990 and 2006. Each slide was evaluated for extent and intensity of staining. Staining extent was expressed as the percentage of stained cells. Staining of <10% of the cells was accepted as negative. Staining intensity was evaluated only in positive cases. By addition of the extent and intensity scores, the combined score was calculated. In our study, the combined CD117 staining scores of neoplastic and inflammatory groups were found to be higher than the reactive and normal groups. Within the neoplastic group, papillary carcinomas differed from follicular adenomas significantly, although papillary carcinomas showed no statistically significant difference compared to follicular carcinomas. Immunohistochemical CD117 positivity was detected in a wide range of neoplastic and inflammatory thyroid diseases. The neoplastic group and, within them, the papillary carcinomas showed a higher ratio of CD117 positivity. Although our results need to be confirmed by other molecular and genetic studies, the high rate of positivity in papillary carcinomas was one of the striking findings, which may result in novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

In a recent study, several cases of cervical cancer metastases with primary manifestation as mucinous or endometrioid ovarian carcinomas were described. In all cases, human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA and diffuse p16 immunostaining were detected in the ovarian tumor tissues. To estimate the frequency of occult metastatic endocervical adenocarcinomas in a series of mucinous or endometrioid ovarian carcinomas, 24 ovarian cancers with mucinous and 50 with endometrioid differentiation from the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynaekologische Onkologie OVAR-3 database were analyzed for HPV and p16 positivity. The p16 immunostaining was performed using the p16 histology kit (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining results were considered positive. Human papillomavirus polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed using 2 consensus primer systems (GP5/GP6 and PGMY09/11) and HPV-16- and HPV-18-specific primers from the L1 and the E6 regions. Six (8%) of 74 tumors were p16-negative, 13 (18%) of 74 showed single positive cells, 28 (38%) of 74 showed focal homogeneous staining, and 27 (36%) of 74 showed complete diffuse staining. In several independent amplifications of different regions of the HPV genome, none of the 73 tumors available for analysis showed the presence of HPV DNA. No ovarian metastases of endocervical adenocarcinomas were found among mucinous and endometrioid adenocarcinomas from a large chemotherapy trial of advanced stage ovarian carcinomas.

The purposes of the present study were to compare the reproducibility and sensitivity between the manual and commercial kit methods and to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency for HCC with the combined analysis of GGT-II, α-L-fucosidase (AFU) and α-fetoprotein (AFP). In patients with various liver diseases (HCC, liver cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis) and normal subjects, GGT-II was detected by manual and commercial polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The levels of AFU and AFP were assayed by colorimetry and a chemiluminescence immunoassay, respectively. The commercial PAGE had equal diagnostic efficiency with traditional manual PAGE and no significant differences were observed in intra- and average-gel reproducibility and GGT-II sensitivities between the manual and commercial PAGE (P>0.05). The incidence of GGT-II detected by commercial PAGE in HCC patients was 84.1% and <8% in benign liver disease. The levels of AFU and AFP in the benign liver diseases and normal subjects were lower than those in HCC. According to the cut-off value obtained by receiver operating characteristic curves, a total of 56.6 and 59.3% of HCC patients (64 out of 113 and 67 out of 113) had AFU >636.5 μmol/l h and AFP >44.0 μg/l, respectively.

Compared with the enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay, the single determinant immuno-PCR technique could allow for as few as 20 cells to be detected and was found to show an approximately 10,000-fold enhancement in sensitivity of the detection limit. The current study clinically evaluated the significance of serum MG7-Ag detection in gastric carcinoma patients.;The sera of patients were immobilized on wells and a specific DNA molecule, which could be amplified by PCR, was employed as a marker. The biotinylated monoclonal antibody against gastric carcinoma was added to bind the antigen immobilized on the wells. After the biotinylated antibody was bound to the antigen, free avidin was used to attach a biotinylated monoclonal antibody and biotinylated DNA molecule. The biotinylated DNA complexed with antigen-antibody-avidin was amplified by PCR and the PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. In the current study this method was used to detect circulating MG7-Ag in the sera of patients with gastric carcinoma and other various malignancies. For comparison, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 50, CA 19-9, and TAG-72 were quantitated by radioimmunoassay and immunoradiometric assay using the relevant commercial kits in the same sera samples from 86 patients with pathologically confirmed gastric carcinoma and 83 patients with relevant benign diseases of the stomach. In addition, the semiquantitative analysis of PCR products among gastric carcinoma patients with or without metastasis was performed to compare the intensity of DNA band amplification.;Using the immuno-PCR assay, positive results were obtained in 164 of 198 patients with gastric carcinoma (82.8%). The rates of positivity in other malignancies were 17.4% for esophageal carcinoma (15 of 86 patients), 44.4% for colonic carcinoma (40 of 90 patients), 0% for liver carcinoma (none of 84 patients), 2.2% for ovarian carcinoma (1 of 45 patients), 0% for uterine carcinoma (none of 27 patients), and 6.1% for lung carcinoma (4 of 66 patients). The positive results obtained from those patients with benign diseases were: 7.7% for peptic ulcer (6 of 78 patients), 5.9% for chronic gastritis (7 of 118 patients), 3.3% for chronic colitis (2 of 60 patients), and 0.8% for healthy blood donors (2 of 236 patients). In addition, the semiquantitative analysis of PCR products showed that the intensity of DNA band amplified from the PCR products of those patients with metastasis was much higher than that of patients without metastasis or those with early stage tumors (1.94 +/- 0.03 vs. 1.28 +/- 0.02). In comparative studies of immuno-PCR and commercial assays for tumor-associated antigens the sensitivity of immuno-PCR was 81.4% and pseudopositivity was lower (8.4% vs. 7.2-12.0% with radioimmunoassay or immunoradiometric assay).;The results of the current study demonstrate that introducing PCR into the indirect determination of tumor-associated antigen in the serum can improve the sensitivity of detection greatly. This novel assay also might be used to monitor the circulating amount of tumor-associated antigen after gastrectomy and provide information regarding recurrence or metastasis, as well as for screening elderly patients who have no indications for endoscopy and those with precancerous conditions. The application of immuno-PCR in the serologic diagnosis of carcinoma has significant advantages including ready application in the clinical setting as well as use as a potential screening tool in mass surveys of high risk populations with gastric carcinoma.

A hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HB8064) was cultured with methanol extract of KY88. We were able to produce a dose-dependent inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. At IC50 and IC100, KY88 induces a DNA ladder pattern, indicating the presence of apoptosis. We also checked the changes of the levels of interleukin (IL)-2, -4 and -6, interferon (INF)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha by ELISA kits. After 24 hours of culture, there was activation of IL-2 and -4 and TNF-alpha. However, significant changes were observed only for IL-4 and TNF-alpha. Therefore, we concluded that KY88 is able to induce apoptosis, which may be regulated through changes in IL-4 and TNF-alpha.",

The mean neopterin levels were lower in the malignant tumour groups than in healthy animals but differences were statistically significant only in carcinoma and sarcoma groups. The decrease of neopterin levels in animals with malignant mammary tumours may suggest their decreased cellular immunity.

In a recent study, p63 was detected in papillary carcinoma, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and in squamoid aggregates and solid cell nests (SCNs), embryonic remnants found sporadically in the fully developed thyroid. In the present study, the relationship between solid cell nests and papillary carcinoma was investigated further. Four-micrometer sections from 88 routinely fixed and processed archival thyroidectomy specimens were pretreated with citric acid pH 6.0 for antigen retrieval, then incubated overnight with anti-p63 monoclonal antibody 4A4. Slides were stained with a streptavidin-biotin kit and diaminobenzidine as chromogen and were counterstained with hematoxylin. Squamoid aggregates or SCNs were noted in 21 specimens. Several morphologic variants of SCNs were found, all of which displayed p63 positivity. These included undifferentiated SCNs and those displaying commitment toward squamoid and ciliated glandular differentiation. Small, morphologically inconspicuous aggregates of p63-positive cells were commonly found in Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Commitment of p63-positive undifferentiated cells toward thyroid follicular epithelial differentiation was occasionally noted. One SCN variant, also associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, was a floretlike arrangement of p63-positive cells with fusiform nuclei. p63 staining was strong and uniform in some SCNs, but in other SCNs it was compartmentalized and homologous to stem cell-staining patterns in normal squamous or bronchial epithelia. Stem cell-like staining, associated with compartmentalized p63 staining or p63-positive undifferentiated cells, was noted in 7 of 27 papillary carcinomas. p63 immunostaining is a highly sensitive means of detecting SCNs. p63 expression patterns in SCNs and a subset of papillary carcinomas are closely homologous to stem cell-associated p63 staining patterns that have been described elsewhere in squamous and bronchial epithelia. We propose a stem-cell-associated model of papillary carcinoma oncogenesis that suggests that (1) p63-positive embryonal remnants rather than mature follicular cells are the cells of origin of a subset of papillary carcinomas; (2) these p63-positive cells are pluripotent and may stay undifferentiated or undergo benign squamoid or glandular maturation, may undergo thyroid follicular epithelial differentiation, may undergo oncogenic change leading to papillary carcinoma, or may trigger an immune reaction, resulting in lymphoid infiltration and Hashimoto's thyroiditis; and (3) Hashimoto's thyroiditis and papillary carcinoma may therefore be linked etiologically, because both disorders may be initiated by the same population of pluripotent p63-positive embryonal stem cell remnants.",

The incidence of sporadic ICC hyperplasia and the so-called seedling leiomyoma (SLM) of the lower oesophagus has not been studied in the KIT era. In a retrospective review of 77 consecutive, routinely processed oesophagogastric resection specimens for distal oesophageal carcinoma, we found foci of ICC hyperplasia in 7 of 77 (9.1%) cases and foci of SLM in 17 of 77 (22%) cases. Two types of ICC hyperplasia were recognized: a non-circumscribed type and a nodular expansile type with peripherally compressed myenteric neural tissues. All cases of ICC hyperplasia were vimentin+/CD34+/CD117+. SLMs were desmin+/vimentin(-)/CD34(-)/CD117(-), similar to smooth muscles of the gut wall. In a prospective study of 32 non-carcinomatous specimens from age-matched patients (mostly autopsy cases), we found SLMs in only one case, but we were unable to detect ICC hyperplasia in any of the cases. We concluded that sporadic KIT-positive spindle-cell hyperplasia and SLMs were unexpectedly common in distal oesophageal specimens harbouring carcinomas.

The ER status in primary and secondary tumours was concordant in 80 patients (79%) and discordant in 21 (21%). Eighteen of these twenty-one patients had ER-positive primary tumours and ER-negative lymph node metastases. This discordance, which may be due to loss of ERs in the metastatic cells or tumour heterogeneity, could explain the well-known failure of endocrine treatment in some of the patients with ER-positive primary tumours. A new monoclonal antibody ID5 (DAKO) against ERs was applied on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from 83 of these 101 primary carcinomas. These analyses and paraffin ER-ICA analyses were compared to prior analyses of the same 83 tumours using the ER-ICA kit on fresh frozen tissue (\"gold standard\", frozen ER-ICA).

In patients with SQC, CYFRA 21-1 and SCC Ag showed significantly higher levels according to the advanced anatomic stages (stage I-IIIa vs. stage IIIb, IV, p < 0.05). There was a good correlation between CYFRA 21-1 and SCC Ag (r = 0.41, p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated from results of both tumor markers and areas under the curves (AUC) were calculated. AUC of CYFRA 21-1 (0.93) were significantly larger than that of SCC Ag (0.77) for the diagnosis of SQC (p < 0.05).

Carnivores such as dogs are usually definitive hosts. Intermediate hosts are typically herbivores such as sheep and cattle. CE can be detected using various imaging techniques such as ultrasonography or radiology. Moreover the primary diagnosis has to be confirmed by serological tests since the clinical signs of the disease are non-specific. This study examined the antigenic band patterns useful for serologic diagnosis of hydatidosis. We also report on the post-operative evolution of patients treated for this disease and also determined the diagnostic performance of Western blot IgG kit. Twenty-five (16 females and 9 males) non-operated patients with hydatid cysts (NOP) and 33 (21 females and 12 males) operated patients with hydatid cysts (OP) were included as study group and 22 healthy individuals (14 females and 8 males) with no known chronic diseases were included as a control group. The ages of the patients and control group individuals were between 16-83 years. Patient and control groups were matched for age and sex. Cyst hydatid IgG antibodies were detected in the sera from all patient groups but no antibodies were found in the sera from the control group using ELISA IgG method. Twenty-three (92%) non-operated patients and 18 (54.5%) operated patients exhibited positive results when Western blot IgG kit was used. The P7 band pattern was detected in the sera from all operated and non-operated patients. Twenty-seven of these positive cases had p7 and (p7+p16/18), (p7+p24/26) or (p7+p16/18+p24/26). No antibodies against p7, p16/18 ve p24/26 band patterns were seen in sera from the control group A statistically significant difference was detected between operated and nonoperated patients for Western blot positivity.(p<0.01). p: 0.018- X2=5,604- OR: 0.176- 95% CI: 0.037- 0.841. The sensitivity, specificity, positive prediction and negative prediction values of Echinococcus granulosus Western blot kit for 25 cases with CE and 22 healthy controls were calculated as 92%, 100%, 100% and 91.7%, respectively. In conclusion, we suggest that monitoring p7 in all non-operated patients may be useful to determine the efficiacy of medical treatment and that monitoring p7 antibodies using serological and Western blot methods in operated patients may be useful for the screening of post-operative evolution in patients with hydatid cyst.",

Concerning immunohistochemistry, most of the cases (17/20) had a strong positive staining. Although sequence alterations were found in four samples, none of these alterations led to amino acid changes in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR comparable to those in non-small cell lung cancer. Thus EGFR-expression in thymic tumours does not rely on mutations in critical functional (activation) domains of the EGFR-gene.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.: A total of 24 cases of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix were evaluated. Cases were stained using the HercepTest kit according to protocol. Results were graded from 0 to 3+, using the standards set for breast lesions. RESULTS.: A total of 17 cases (70.8%) were negative, 3 cases (12.5%) showed 1+ staining, and 4 cases (16.7%) showed 2+ staining. No cases showed 3+ staining. Higher her-2 staining grade correlated strongly with vaginal margin status. A weak positive correlation was seen between her-2 staining and tumor stage. There was no correlation with tumor grade or histological lymph node status. CONCLUSIONS.: A subset of invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix overexpress her-2 protein.

They represent different cells of origin, explaining their specific characteristics, including expression of markers useful for diagnosis. Here, the most frequent variant of testicular GCTs will be discussed, i.e., the type II GCT, referred to as TGCTs, i.e. seminomas and nonseminomas. Various risk factors have been identified. These tumors originate from a transformed primordial germ cell/gonocyte, known as carcinoma in situ (CIS), that is able to generate all differentiation lineages (omnipotent). The c-KIT-stem cell factor pathway is of relevance for development of this cancer. Retention of embryonic characteristics probably explains the unique treatment responsiveness to DNA-damaging agents. OCT3/4, a marker of pluripotency, is the optimal diagnostic marker for seminoma and embryonal carcinoma, and CIS, the latter also in semen, suitable for non-invasive screening. In addition, distinction between seminoma and embryonal carcinoma can be made using SOX17 and SOX2. Micro-satellite instability as well as BRAF mutations have been identified to be related to treatment resistance, possibly leading to improved clinical management.",

It has been shown in animal models that interaction between neoplastic epithelial cells and adjacent stroma can modulate tumor behavior. Carcinoma associated stromal cells can transform normal epithelial cells into neoplastic cells. In breast, columnar cell lesions are non-obligate precursors of low grade ductal carcinoma in situ. Columnar cell lesions can be seen intimately associated with PASH-like-stroma, a lesion we termed as CCPLS. Our aim is to investigate epithelial-stromal interactions in CCPLS and compare them to PASH without columnar cell lesions in breast core needle biopsies. Normal terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU) epithelium was seen in association with columnar cell lesions as well as PASH. Eight (8) cases of each category were examined by a panel of immunostains: CD117 (C-kit), CD34, CD105, bFGF, AR, ER-beta, MIB-1. We observed a markedly decreased expression of c-kit in columnar cell lesions compared to TDLU-epithelium. CD105 showed a quantitative increase in activated vessels in CCPLS compared to PASH. A subset of CCPLS and PASH were androgen receptor positive. A strong nuclear positivity for ER-beta is observed in the epithelium and stroma of all CCPLS cases. We conclude that (1) activated blood vessels predominate in CCPLS; (2) A molecular alteration is signified by c-kit loss in columnar cell lesions; (3) ER-beta and androgen receptor positivity indicate CCPLS are hormonally responsive lesions. Our study suggests an intimate vascular and hormone dependent epithelial-stromal interaction exists in CCPLS lesions.",

However, the parasite spreads unevenly through tissues, forming tissue cysts, and the cystic wall is an obstacle in DNA extraction protocols. Therefore, adequate sampling and effective disruption of the cysts are essential to improve the accuracy of DNA detection by PCR. The aims of this study were to evaluate the suitability of four protocols for DNA extraction from cysts of Sarcocystis spp. present in bovine myocardium samples or after their harvest in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution as well as determine the effects of single or multiple sampling on the accuracy of molecular diagnosis of sarcocystosis in cattle hearts. Cysts and myocardium samples from nine bovine hearts were randomly distributed to four DNA extraction protocols: kit, kit with modification, DNAzol, and cetyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB). Samples were submitted to DNA extraction and PCR as replicates of each heart (simplicate, duplicate, and triplicate), and the probability of a true positive diagnostic was calculated. Among the protocols tested, the kit with modification was determined to be the most suitable for DNA extraction from cysts in PBS solution (92.6 % of DNA detection by PCR); DNAzol resulted in higher DNA detection frequency from bovine myocardium samples (48.1 %). Multiple sampling improved the molecular diagnosis of Sarcocystis spp. infection in cattle hearts, increasing at 22.2 % the rate of true positive diagnostic. ",

The cut-off required to select a fixed proportion of samples (0.5% for the UK protocol) for second-tier mutation analysis varies over time, partly owing to slight differences in calibration of individual lots of assay kit. To investigate this and possible inter-laboratory differences in analytical performance, we developed a monitoring system based on the distribution of measured IRT concentrations in the screened samples. Results were collected fortnightly from five UK screening laboratories in the form of numbers of samples in histogram 'bins' of IRT concentration. These data were converted to cumulative percentages and the IRT concentrations at fixed centiles then approximated by triangulation. The quantile-quantile plot of any subset (by laboratory or by kit lot) of these data using pooled results (all-laboratories all-kit-lots, approximately 270,000 samples) as the reference distribution is analogous to a calibration curve and gives a measure of bias in terms of sensitivity (slope) and baseline (y-intercept). This allows a revised 99.5th centile cut-off for each subset to be calculated directly. A similar approach has allowed inter-laboratory comparison of tandem-mass spectrometric assays for free carnitine (with emphasis on low values) and phenylalanine and has demonstrated that apparently trivial differences in instrumentation and procedures have resulted in marked variation in resultant assay performance.",

The progression of CIN to cervical carcinoma has been associated especially with the genomic integration of oncogenic human papilloma virus (HPV) and gain of the human telomerase RNA gene hTERC (3q26) and MYC (8q24). In this study, cytology specimens of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical carcinoma from 74 Czech women were analyzed using the triple-color Cervical FISH Probe Kit designed for identification of HPV infected cells and copy number aberration of the hTERC and MYC genes. HPV-positivity exhibited 70% of patients with premalignant lesions (CIN I - CIN III, carcinoma in situ), chromosomal changes were found in 53.3% of cases - MYC amplification had 33.3% of women with CIN I - CIN III and 50% with carcinoma in situ. Amplification of hTERC was detected in 16.7% of patient with CIN I, in 50% with CIN II, in 58.3% with CIN III and in 66.7% with carcinoma in situ. Based on HPV-positivity and the occurrence of chromosomal aberrations, patients were divided into high-, intermediate- and low-risk group. Among women with cervical carcinomas, HPV infection was detected in 90.1% of specimens and chromosomal aberrations were found in 87.5% of samples. Amplification of MYC gene was detected in 25% and hTERC gene in 62.5% of patients. According to the histopathological grade of tumors, MYC gene amplification occurred more frequently in specimens of spinocellular carcinoma than adenocarcinoma (p=0.029). We found no association between the frequency of cytogenetic lesions and the incidence of lymphangiogenesis or lymph node metastases in cervical carcinoma patients. Simultaneous hTERC and MYC genes amplification was significantly more frequent in samples of cervical carcinomas than in premalignant lesions (p=0.008).In a cohort of 26 patients with cervical carcinoma we used oligo-based GGH+SNP microarray technique for the high resolution mapping of copy number changes of hTERC and MYC genes. We found that recurrent gain of genetic material in chromosome 3q26 area carrying hTERC gene of size 43.6 Mb between 3q25.1-3qter and duplication of 3q were the most common genomic identifications of amplified gene. In MYC locus array-CGH profiling identified duplication of 8q and trisomy 8 as frequent genomic changes.Our work confirmed that in cervical carcinoma gains of hTERC and MYC genes are specific genomic changes associated with developing of malignant phenotype.

However, cytology has relatively poor sensitivity especially in well differentiated tumors. Cystoscopy is an invasive and relatively expensive method. Therefore, methods improving detection of urothelial carcinoma from urine specimens are employed. Uro Vysion (Vysis) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for improved detection of urothelial carcinoma was evaluated.;Bladder tumor progression is accompanied by increased chromosomal instability and aneuploidy of chromosomes 3, 7, 17 and loss of locus 9p21. A total of 124 patients were analyzed at Dpts. of Urology and Pathology, Faculty Hospital in Brno. Cytologically analyzed urine specimens were tested by FISH and simultaneously cystoscopy was employed including biopsy for histological examination.;FISH analysis was positive in 35 cases, including 5 cases with negative biopsy and cytology. Negative FISH result was detected in 24 cases where the malignant status was determined. The sensitivity of FISH in our series was 58.9% and the specificity 88.1%.;FISH is a relatively simple, speedy and non invasive diagnostic method. It detects the symptoms of malignity on the molecular level, which leads to earlier diagnosis and therapy and, hence, to potential extended survival. FISH makes it possible to take decision in cases of atypical or unclear cytological finding.

Otherwise, the nuclear medicine specialist will not administer a high radioiodine dose because it might be hazardous due to the possibility of thyroid remnant actinic thyroiditis. Considering this, it would be necessary to use two rhTSH kits (one for diagnostic purposes and the other one to administer the 131I dose). In this study, we used an alternative protocol for TRA with the use of one kit of rhTSH in twenty patients diagnosed with low risk papillary thyroid carcinoma. All patients had negative titers of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies. Successful thyroid remnant ablation was confirmed with an undetectable rhTSH stimulated thyroglobulin level (< 1 ng/ml) in all 20 patients between 8 to 12 months after radioiodine administration. The use of this protocol combining scintigraphy with the subsequent administration of a therapeutic dose following the administration of one kit of rhTSH would avoid the need of using 2 kits to perform the ablation and would decrease the costs associated with its use while significantly enhancing the quality of life of patients with thyroid cancer.",

The lack of an animal model for CF-related diabetes (CFRD) has made it difficult to dissect how the onset of pancreatic pathology influences the emergence of CFRD. We evaluated the structure and function of the neonatal CF endocrine pancreas using a new CFTR-knockout ferret model. Although CF kits are born with only mild exocrine pancreas disease, progressive exocrine and endocrine pancreatic loss during the first months of life was associated with pancreatic inflammation, spontaneous hyperglycemia, and glucose intolerance. Interestingly, prior to major exocrine pancreas disease, CF kits demonstrated significant abnormalities in blood glucose and insulin regulation, including diminished first-phase and accentuated peak insulin secretion in response to glucose, elevated peak glucose levels following glucose challenge, and variably elevated insulin and C-peptide levels in the nonfasted state. Although there was no difference in lobular insulin and glucagon expression between genotypes at birth, significant alterations in the frequencies of small and large islets were observed. Newborn cultured CF islets demonstrated dysregulated glucose-dependent insulin secretion in comparison to controls, suggesting intrinsic abnormalities in CF islets. These findings demonstrate that early abnormalities exist in the regulation of insulin secretion by the CF endocrine pancreas.",

To investigate the frequency of PIK3CA mutations in the intraductal proliferative lesions of the breast, which are precursor lesions for invasive carcinoma, we analyzed 125 intraductal proliferative lesions and 108 invasive breast cancer tissues for PIK3CA mutations in this study. Target cells were precisely isolated using a laser capture microdissection (LCM) system. Genomic DNA was extracted with QIAmp DNA Micro Kit. PCR amplification was done for exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA, where 90% of mutations clustered, and the products were directly sequenced. Forty-six missense mutations were identified in total, of which, 14 and 32 mutations clustered in exon 9 and exon 20, respectively. The most common mutations were E542K (6 cases) and E545K (8 cases) in exon 9, and H1047R (29 cases) in exon 20. A novel mutation, G3292T, was also found. Mutations were found less frequently in the ductal intraepithelial neoplasia 1B (DIN1B) and lower grade ductal proliferative lesions (3 of 68; 4.41%) than in ductal carcinoma in situ (14 of 57; 24.56%, P=0.001, Chi-square test) or invasive carcinoma (29 of 108; 26.85%, P=0.000, Chi-square test).

The aim of this study was to test the diagnostic utility of MS-MLPA to evaluate the methylation status of 34 genes in normal colonic mucosa samples and in a well-characterized series of 83 adenocarcinomas and 21 neuroendocrine carcinomas of colon-rectum. Two commercial MS-MLPA kits (SALSA MS-MLPA ME001-C1 Tumor suppressor-1 Kit and SALSA MS-MLPA ME002-B1 Tumor suppressor-2 Kit) were used to perform promoter methylation analysis on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues. MS-MLPA analysis was validated by bisulfite pyrosequencing, bisulfite cycle sequencing, and methylation-specific PCR. MS-MLPA analysis identified a subset of 27 CRCs (26 % of cases) showing high levels of gene methylation involving a mean percentage of 34 % of the promoters examined. These tumors exhibited all the main clinicopathological and genetic features described for CRCs with CpG island Methylator Phenotype-High. High levels of methylation were observed with similar frequency in adenocarcinomas and in neuroendocrine carcinomas (25 % versus 29 %, respectively), but different methylation profiles were observed in the two tumor types. In both groups, tumors with microsatellite instability and widespread methylation represented a homogeneous clinicopathological entity. MS-MLPA assay is an easy and reliable system for epigenetic characterization of tumor tissues and leads to a rapid identification of CRCs with the highest levels of gene methylation. Aberrant gene methylation is a common abnormality in CRC initiation and may be observed in tumors with very different genetic and clinicopathological profiles.",

There is a high rate of recurrence despite first-line chemotherapy. Sarcoma of the uterus, while accounting for a small percent of uterine cancers, is also associated with a high-recurrence rate and poor overall survival. Therefore, the development of novel treatment strategies is paramount. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., East Hanover, NJ) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against abl, c-kit, and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and is approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Preclinical data provides evidence for c-kit and PDGFR expression in ovarian epithelial carcinomas and uterine sarcomas and have led to clinical trials evaluating the use of imatinib in these malignancies. Additionally, inhibition of PDGFR signaling has been proposed as an effective mechanism of chemotherapy by lowering tumor interstitial fluid pressure. Recent data have also suggested benefit with metronomic scheduling of cytotoxic agents at lower doses at more frequent dosing intervals, in combination with other targeted therapies. While activity of this agent remains to be established, further studies of imatinib in gynecologic malignancies are warranted, to demonstrate not only single-agent activity and the enhancement of cytotoxicity of other antineoplastic agents.",

CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells were isolated from cord blood using a CD34+ Progenitor Cell Isolation Kit by magnetic cell sorting system (MACS). CD34+ cells were incubated with rhGM-CSF, rhTNF-alpha and rhSCF for 2 weeks as DC (dendritic cells), and then by PEG-3600 to fuse with an esophageal carcinoma cell line. Selection with MACS marked with HLA-DR MicroBeads generated EC109-DC. Phenotypes and proliferation were analyzed by flow cytometry and cell culture in vitro. The lymphocyte proliferation reaction and CTL cytotoxicity were examined by MTT assay. The EC109-DC cells could proliferate slowly in vitro and highly expressed CD80, CD83 and CD86. The lymphocyte proliferation reaction and specific cytotoxicity against EC109 induced by EC109-DC cells were significantly higher than in control groups (p < 0.05). EC109-DC cells obtained by PEG fusion acquired the immuno-stimulating phenotype and could significantly stimulate the lymphocyte proliferation reaction and CTL activity. The results of this research provide the basis for materials to develop the DC-based vaccine against esophageal carcinoma.",

In a 3 center collaborative study of 288 cases with clinical follow-up information, it could be demonstrated that apart from clinical parameters like high patient's age, male sex and high tumor stage, the application of a 3-tiered grading system incorporating the histological tumor type is of high prognostic relevance. In immunohistochemical and molecular analyses overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), high expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), amplification and gains of EGFR and HER2, absent expression of C-KIT, loss of maspin and of O(6)-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) as well as MGMT promoter methylation turned out to be negative prognostic factors. In mucoepidermoid carcinomas the presence of a translocation t(11;19) was less relevant than recognizing different subtypes (classical type, eosinophilic, clear-cell and squamoid variants). Acinic cell carcinoma with mixed acinar-ductular differentiation as judged by expression of CK7 was characterized by a higher frequency of early relapse.

Although several immune evasion mechanisms by echinococcal cysts have been described, it is unclear whether the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) system plays a role in the susceptibility or resistance to CE in humans. HLA-G molecules are known to exert a suppressive action on dendritic cells maturation and on natural killer (NK) cells functions, therefore hampering T-cell responses and NK cytolysis. HLA-G plays an important role in immune tolerance, is involved in foetus and in allotransplant tolerance, and may be involved in tumoral and viral immune evasion.

This report presents data on these unknown cellular miRNAs cloned from P. aeruginosa isolates from CF patients. Adapting a computational miRNA prediction model that takes advantage of the highly conserved known miRNA hair pin stems regions, the results revealed that the fold structure of the microRNAs had a high homology to the recently reported human bacterial infection response (BiR)-related microRNA, mi-146, associated with the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, which is the primary evolutionarily conserved sensors of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and known to trigger host inflammatory and immune responses.",

This molecular diversity is probably one of the reasons explaining the poor results of most of the clinical trials recently published because we don't know yet how to identify and select the right population of patients who could beneficiate from such or such therapy. However, some very encouraging results obtained with new protocols for adoptive immunotherapy have been published and we also hope that further results will confirm that the subset of KIT-mutated melanomas will beneficiate from an efficient targeted anti-Kit therapy. Besides melanoma, the scoop of the year was the discovery of a defective oncogenic polyomavirus which is very likely to be responsible for Merkel cell carcinoma.",

Results were compared with previous intraoperative touch preparations, frozen sections, hematoxylin and eosin (Perm H&E), and AEl/3-immunostained permanent sections (Perm CK).;Fourteen lymph nodes (19%) in 13 patients tested positive for metastatic carcinoma in Perm H&E, the gold standard. RIHC-CK had the highest sensitivity (92%) of the intraoperative tests, compared with touch preparations (64%) and frozen sections (80%). RIHC-CK showed 94% accuracy, compared with 96% (frozen section) and 93% (touch preparation). The RIHC technique took 8 minutes and was easy to perform and interpret.;Zymed RIHC is a sensitive method for detecting breast cancer metastases in SLNs. The speed, accuracy, and ease of interpretation of the test allow for recognition of micrometastases (<2 mm) that might otherwise be undetectable by current methods of intraoperative evaluation.

Although AI was found to be prognostically significant in univariate analysis, it failed to retain an independent and significant value regarding overall survival in multivariate analysis.;Decreased expression of p27Kip1 and reduction of apoptotic potential were two of the most important factors in predicting a poor prognosis for patients with non-early stage gastric carcinoma. These findings support the hypothesis that decreased p27Kip1 expression, which may reflect a decreased rate of apoptosis, is closely related to the aggressiveness of gastric carcinoma.

In contrast, the molecular features and presence of targetable genetic abnormalities in pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas are largely unknown. Thirty-three cases of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma were tested for approximately 2800 mutations in 50 oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes, including EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, TP53, BRAF, ERBB2, JAK3, AKT1, ATM, MET, KIT, and PIK3CA. ALK immunostaining was performed, and ALK FISH was performed on cases with any degree of staining. Twenty-four of the 33 cases (72%) had at least one genetic abnormality: 19 cases (58%) had TP53 mutations; 10 cases (30%) had KRAS mutations; AKT1, JAK3, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA mutations were observed in 1 case each (3%). Six of the 19 cases (32%) with a mutation in TP53 had simultaneous mutations in KRAS (18%). The cases with alterations in JAK3, BRAF, and NRAS also had mutations in TP53. The case showing a mutation in PIK3CA had a mutation in KRAS. No EGFR mutations were observed. One case had ALK gene rearrangement. ALK rearrangement was observed in a single case of sarcomatoid carcinoma (3%), which has currently available targeted therapy. Four tumors had mutations in genes with experimental molecular-based therapy, including BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, and AKT1.

The so-called P2 promoter involved is located in intron 12 and its activity was found to be mutually exclusive with activity of the classical promoter (P1), which encodes the full-length receptor. The presence of the 1.5 kb transcript could be a putative marker for the early molecular diagnosis of TGCTs. In order to validate the RT-PCR approach, this study shows that not more than 100 transcripts are necessary to obtain positivity in the test used; moreover, samples from TGCTs or CIS-containing tissues can be diluted many-fold before resulting in false-negative findings. This study also shows that within TGCTs, as in TGCT-derived cell lines, expression of the 1.5 kb transcript is differentiation-dependent and positively correlated with expression of the embryonic transcription factor OCT-4/POU5F1. Furthermore, the results indicate that in some non-TGCT cancers and cell lines the 1.5 kb transcript is also expressed, but without concomitant OCT-4/POU5F1 expression. The 1.5 kb transcript is also present in early B cells and derived leukaemias (B-ALL). In spite of similarities in chromosomal location, down-regulation upon differentiation of TGCTs, and PDGF alpha-receptor and c-KIT (the stem cell factor receptor) both being a tyrosine kinase receptor, no correlation was found between activity of the P2 promoter of the PDGF alpha-receptor gene and expression of c-KIT. In conclusion, the 1.5 kb transcript of the PDGF alpha-receptor is expressed in various cells and tissues, including particular blood cells. Although this may hamper the use of this transcript as a marker for malignancies in general, it does not appear to interfere with assays for the early detection of TGCTs.",

We have used a standardized ATP-tumor chemosensitivity assay and immunohistochemistry to determine the cytotoxicity of imatinib mesylate in tumor-derived cells from cutaneous and uveal melanoma, and ovarian carcinoma. Imatinib mesylate was tested at concentrations ranging from 2.0 to 0.0625 micromol/l alone and in combination with a cytotoxic drug (cisplatin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel or treosulfan). Imatinib mesylate showed low inhibition (IndexSUM>300) across the range of concentrations tested in this study, with few tumors exhibiting increasing inhibition with increased drug concentration. The median IC90 values for cutaneous and uveal melanoma and ovarian carcinoma were 13.2 micromol/l (4.0-294.3 micromol/l), 12.0 micromol/l (2.0-285.4 micromol/l) and 7.71 micromol/l (6.51-11.02 micromol/l), respectively. Imatinib mesylate potentiated the effect of different cytotoxics in 9% (5/54) of cases and had a negative effect in 13% (7/54) of cases, with no effect in the remainder. No correlation of effect was noted with c-kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha or platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta expression, assessed by immunohistochemistry. The signaling pathways mediated by activation of c-kit or platelet-derived growth factor receptor may act as antiapoptotic survival signals in some cancers and inhibition of these pathways may potentiate the activity of some cytotoxic drugs by inhibiting the survival signal. Growth inhibition, however, may reduce the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs, which tend to target proliferating cells preferentially, and clinical effects are therefore difficult to predict.",

        "Doc_abstract":"The tests that are currently available for the measurement of overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2) in breast cancer have shown considerable problems in accuracy and interlaboratory reproducibility. Although these problems are partly alleviated by the use of validated, standardised 'kits', there may be considerable cost involved in their use. Prior to testing it may therefore be an advantage to be able to predict from basic pathology data whether a cancer is likely to overexpress HER2. In this study, we have correlated pathology features of cancers with the frequency of HER2 overexpression assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using HercepTest (Dako). In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) has been used to re-test the equivocal cancers and interobserver variation in assessing HER2 overexpression has been examined by a slide circulation scheme. Of the 1536 cancers, 1144 (74.5%) did not overexpress HER2. Unequivocal overexpression (3+ by IHC) was seen in 186 cancers (12%) and an equivocal result (2+ by IHC ) was seen in 206 cancers (13%). Of the 156 IHC 3+ cancers for which complete data was available, 149 (95.5%) were ductal NST and 152 (97%) were histological grade 2 or 3. Only 1 of 124 infiltrating lobular carcinomas (0.8%) showed HER2 overexpression. None of the 49 'special types' of carcinoma showed HER2 overexpression. Re-testing by FISH of a proportion of the IHC 2+ cancers showed that only 25 (23%) of those assessable exhibited HER2 gene amplification, but 46 of the 47 IHC 3+ cancers (98%) were confirmed as showing gene amplification. Circulating slides for the assessment of HER2 score showed a moderate level of agreement between pathologists (kappa 0.4). As a result of this study we would advocate consideration of a triage approach to HER2 testing. Infiltrating lobular and special types of carcinoma may not need to be routinely tested at presentation nor may grade 1 NST carcinomas in which only 1.4% have been shown to overexpress HER2. Testing of these carcinomas may be performed when HER2 status is required to assist in therapeutic or other clinical/prognostic decision-making. The highest yield of HER2 overexpressing carcinomas is seen in the grade 3 NST subgroup in which 24% are positive by IHC.",

CCN2 was assessed for its stimulation of HepG2 cell migration and invasion using commercial kits while flow cytometry was used to determine CCN2 effects on HepG2 cell-cycle.;In situ hybridization analysis showed that TGF-β1 mRNA was mainly detected in connective tissues and vasculature around carcinoma foci. In comparison to normal controls, CCN2 mRNA was enhanced 1.9-fold in carcinoma foci (12.36 ± 6.08 vs 6.42 ± 2.35) or 9.4-fold in the surrounding stroma (60.27 ± 28.71 vs 6.42 ± 2.35), with concomitant expression of CCN2 and TGF-β1 mRNA in those areas. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype related with CCN2 was detected in 12/36 (33.3%) of HCC liver samples at the edges between carcinoma foci and vasculature. Incubation of HepG2 cells with CCN2 (100 ng/mL) resulted in more of the cells transitioning into S phase (23.85 ± 2.35 vs 10.94 ± 0.23), and induced a significant migratory (4.0-fold) and invasive (5.7-fold) effect. TGF-β1-induced cell invasion was abrogated by a neutralizing CCN2 antibody showing that CCN2 is a downstream mediator of TGF-β1-induced hepatoma cell invasion.;These data support a role for CCN2 in the growth and metastasis of HCC and highlight CCN2 as a potential novel therapeutic target.",

A panel of thyroid transcription factor (TTF) 1 and p63 has been shown to be useful in distinguishing SCCs from poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma of the lung (PDSLC) in small biopsies and cytological cell blocks. Because tumor samples frequently are limited to cytological smears, we attempted to detect p63 in destained slides from a spectrum of pulmonary malignancies. Archival alcohol-fixed smears from 60 cases of cytologically diagnosed malignancies in bronchoscopically (n = 59) or fine-needle aspiration-obtained specimens (n = 1) were destained in acid alcohol, postfixed in 10% formalin, subjected to citrate-based antigen retrieval, and immunostained by exposure to anti-p63 monoclonal antibody 4A4, followed by reagents from a streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase kit, and diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. Postfixation in 10% formalin was found to be necessary for immunostaining. Normal ciliated and goblet cells were p63 negative, but reserve cells were p63 positive. All cases of squamous-cell carcinoma were positive for p63. Of 10 tumor samples originally diagnosed as SCC, only 6 samples were p63 negative and 4 samples exhibited positive staining. However, proper interpretation of the immunohistochemical (IHC) staining pattern and careful scrutiny of the cytological features and biopsy specimens in three of four cases led us to reclassify three cases into PDSLC. All adenocarcinomas (ACAs; n = 12), large-cell carcinomas (n = 4), and metastatic ACAs (n = 5) were p63 negative. Positive staining was seen in 9/16 tumors designated as non-SCCs; these tumors were not classified further into distinct histological categories.p63 staining in destained slides may be of value in facilitating the differential diagnosis between PDSLC and SCC. Criteria for conservative interpretation of results are discussed and include examination of reserve cells and ciliated cells on the same slide as internal positive and negative controls.",

Imatinib induces, rapid and sustained clinical benefit by blocking the signaling via c-KIT. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>30%) include edema, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, rash, fatigue and abdominal pain.;Herein, we report a case series of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) occurring secondary to imatinib in two patients treated for GISTs. Both patients were successfully managed with surgical resection of SCC and the discontinuation of the drug. Furthermore, we undertook a comprehensive literature review on this association. Few cases of cutaneous SCC secondary to imatinib therapy were reported in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. However, there was no clinical evidence on causation of imatinib-associated SCC in patients with GIST.;To our knowledge, the present report is the first to describe imatinib-related SCC in patients undergoing treatment for GISTs.

As an antiapoptotic agent, it could also protect epithelial cells from death during ductal lumen formation and during breast involution. In breast carcinomas, Snail transcription factors have been linked to tumor progression and invasiveness. Possible mechanisms include repression of the E-cadherin gene by Snail or Slug. However, it is not clear how this transcriptional activity is implicated in vivo. Other possible mechanisms involve maintenance of a plastic phenotype by Slug that could participate in local invasion of ductal carcinomas, and interference with apoptotic pathways that could contribute to global tumor growth and radioresistance.

Aberrant c-Kit activation protects cells from apoptosis and enhances invasion of colon carcinoma cells. Tandutinib is a novel quinazoline-based inhibitor of the type III receptor tyrosine kinases including c-Kit. We determined the effect of tandutinib on colon cancer growth and identified a mechanism of action. Tandutinib inhibited phosphorylation of c-Kit, Akt, mTOR, and p70S6 kinase. In addition, tandutinib significantly inhibited the proliferation and colony formation ability of colon cancer cell lines but did not affect normal colonic epithelial cells. There were increased levels of activated caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl2 ratio, coupled with a reduction in cyclin D1, suggesting apoptosis. There was also a downregulation of COX-2, VEGF, and interleukin-8 expression, suggesting effects on cancer-promoting genes. In addition, overexpressing constitutively active Akt partially suppressed tandutinib-mediated colon cancer cell growth. In vivo, intraperitoneal administration of tandutinib significantly suppressed growth of colon cancer tumor xenografts. There was a reduction in CD31-positive blood vessels, suggesting that there was an effect on angiogenesis. Tandutinib treatment also inhibited the expression of cancer-promoting genes COX-2 and VEGF and suppressed the activation of Akt/mTOR signaling proteins in the xenograft tissues.

        "Doc_abstract":"Ovarian serous carcinoma (OSC) is the most common ovarian epithelial malignancy. Recently, a dualistic pathway of ovarian serous carcinogenesis has been proposed based on morphologic observations and molecular genetic analysis. In this scheme, low-grade OSC arises in a stepwise fashion from a benign serous cystadenoma through a usual serous borderline tumor through a micropapillary variant of serous borderline tumor. In contrast, the more common high-grade OSC arises de novo from the ovarian surface epithelium or the epithelium of cortical inclusion cysts with an as yet unrecognized precursor lesion. Although the division of OSC into low- and high-grade variants is gaining greater acceptance, and although there is accumulating molecular genetic evidence for this, there is little published information regarding a comparison of protein expression between these two types of OSC. In this study, we have investigated the immunohistochemical expression of a wide range of proteins in cases of low-grade (n = 22) and high-grade (n = 47) OSC. Antibodies used were p53, MIB1, BCL2, WT1, HER-2/neu, C-KIT, osteopontin, and survivin. For all antibodies, except MIB1, cases were scored as 0 (negative or occasional positive cells), 1+ (<10% cells positive), 2+ (10%-25% cells positive), 3+ (26%-50% cells positive), 4+ (51%-75% cells positive) or 5+ (>75% cells positive). For MIB1, the percentage of positive nuclei was calculated. There was a statistically significant higher expression of p53, MIB1, BCL2, HER-2/neu, and C-KIT in high-grade compared with low-grade OSC (P < 0.05). Thirty of 47 (64%) cases of high-grade OSC exhibited 5+ staining with p53 compared with 4 of 22 (18%) low-grade neoplasms. Twelve of 47 (26%) high-grade OSCs exhibited 5+ staining with BCL2 compared with 1 of 22 (5%) low-grade OSCs. The mean MIB1 proliferative index in high-grade OSCs was 55.4% compared with 23.0% in low-grade OSCs. Virtually all cases of both low-grade and high-grade OSCs exhibited diffuse nuclear positivity with WT1 and diffuse cytoplasmic positivity with survivin. Osteopontin expression was variable with no significant difference in expression between low-grade and high-grade OSC. Although expression of both HER-2/neu and C-KIT was significantly higher in high-grade compared with low-grade OSC, only rare cases exhibited strong positivity with these antibodies, which could be of therapeutic value in individual cases, although this would require additional molecular investigations. The significant differences in protein expression between low-grade and high-grade OSC provides further support for a different underlying pathogenesis. In particular, the differences in p53 immunoreactivity are in keeping with the observation that p53 gene mutation is more common in high-grade than low-grade OSC.",

We have evaluated published methods for preparation of 99Tcm-(V)DMSA that are based on the modification of 99Tcm-(III)DMSA commercial kits. The criteria for assessment were achievement of satisfactory radiochemical purity and practical considerations regarding the ease of synthesis. Quantification of the desired product's activity was achieved via thin-layer chromatography (silica gel) with an n-butanol:acetic acid:water solvent system. The developed plates were imaged on a gamma camera and analysed using standard software. The methods investigated were designated as Birmingham, Cambridge and Canterbury: the latter two were very similar. With experience, the methods eventually produced similar radiochemical purities of > 90%. However, the Birmingham method was found to be more satisfactory in terms of its reliability and simplicity of synthesis.",

We attempted to (1) determine that quantitative differences exist in the levels of telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) mRNA expression among different grades of laryngeal epithelial abnormalities classified according to the Ljubljana classification; (2) determine that telomerase reactivation is an important, most probably early event in laryngeal carcinogenesis; and (3) analyze whether the relative quantity of hTERT mRNA can be used as a molecular biomarker in the early detection of precancerous lesions. The relative quantity of hTERT mRNA, expressed as an hTERT index, was analyzed in 140 frozen laryngeal tissue specimens representing different morphological stages of laryngeal carcinogenesis by using a commercially available LightCycler Telo TAGGG hTERT Quantification kit. The presence and relative quantity of hTERT mRNA in laryngeal epithelium increases progressively with the degree of epithelial abnormalities. hTERT mRNA was detectable in 1/15 normal laryngeal epithelia (7%, mean hTERT index 0.02), 3/15 simple hyperplasias (20%, mean hTERT index 0.09), 10/27 abnormal hyperplasias (37%, mean hTERT index 0.18), 9/12 atypical hyperplasias (75%, mean hTERT index 0.74), 8/9 intraepithelial carcinomas (89%, mean hTERT index 1.82), and 53/62 invasive laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas (85%, mean hTERT index 2.51). Statistical analysis revealed two groups of laryngeal epithelial changes with significant differences in the levels of hTERT mRNA expression (P <.0033): (1) normal and reactive hyperplastic laryngeal epithelium (simple and abnormal hyperplasia) and (2) atypical hyperplasia (precancerous lesion), intraepithelial and invasive laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. The results of the present study suggest that telomerase reactivation is an early event in laryngeal carcinogenesis, detectable already at the stage of precancerous laryngeal epithelial changes. Nevertheless, other genetic abnormalities appear to be necessary for progression of these epithelial abnormalities toward invasive laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.",

Therefore, a combination of chemotherapeutics with NF-κB inhibitors could overcome resistance of cancer cells. Oridonin is a diterpenoid isolated from Rabdosia rubescens that can block the NF-κB signaling cascades. In this study, we investigated the synergistic effect of oridonin and cisplatin on human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. Cell apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential loss were examined using Hoechst 33258 and rhodamine-123 staining, followed by flow cytometry, respectively. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins and NF-κB subunits was detected by real-time PCR and western blot. The activity of caspase 3 and 9 was measured using the Caspase Activity Kit. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based kit were used to assess the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB. We found a synergistic antitumor effect between cisplatin and oridonin on HepG2 cells both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the combination of cisplatin and oridonin synergistically induces apoptosis and regulates the expression and activity of several key apoptosis-related proteins. Furthermore, the combination treatment not only downregulates nuclear translocation of p50 and p65, but more significantly, decreases the transcription activity of all NF-κB subunits to a greater degree than either agent alone. Our results suggest that the synergistic effect between both agents is likely to be driven by the inhibition of transcription activity of NF-κB and the resulting increased apoptosis. ",

Currently, there exist clinical assays that identify ER+/luminal and HER2-overexpressing tumors, and we sought to develop a clinical assay for breast basal-like tumors.;To identify an immunohistochemical profile for breast basal-like tumors, we collected a series of known basal-like tumors and tested them for protein patterns that are characteristic of this subtype. Next, we examined the significance of these protein patterns using tissue microarrays and evaluated the prognostic significance of these findings.;Using a panel of 21 basal-like tumors, which was determined using gene expression profiles, we saw that this subtype was typically immunohistochemically negative for estrogen receptor and HER2 but positive for basal cytokeratins, HER1, and/or c-KIT. Using breast carcinoma tissue microarrays representing 930 patients with 17.4-year mean follow-up, basal cytokeratin expression was associated with low disease-specific survival. HER1 expression was observed in 54% of cases positive for basal cytokeratins (versus 11% of negative cases) and was associated with poor survival independent of nodal status and size. c-KIT expression was more common in basal-like tumors than in other breast cancers but did not influence prognosis.;A panel of four antibodies (ER, HER1, HER2, and cytokeratin 5/6) can accurately identify basal-like tumors using standard available clinical tools and shows high specificity. These studies show that many basal-like tumors express HER1, which suggests candidate drugs for evaluation in these patients.",

Accurately diagnosing CNS GCTs might be extremely difficult and requires immunohistochemical verification. This study was to investigate the biological feature of CNS GCTs and diagnostic value of immunohistochemical markers OCT3/4, C-kit, PLAP, and CD30 in CNS GCTs. A retrospective study was performed on 34 patients with CNS germ cell tumors between 1990 and 2014. 34 CNS GCTs account for 9.2% of all primary CNS neoplasms. The sellar region (35.3%) and pineal gland (17.6%) were the most common sites of intracranial GCTs. Hydrocephalus (82.4%) and diplopia (46.9%) were the two most common clinical presentations. The most common histological subtypes were germinoma (67.6%). PLAP, c-kit, OCT3/4 were highly expressed in gernimomas. CD30 and CK AE1/3 stainings were positive in embryonal carcinoma. Yolk sac tumor component showed positive staining for AFP and CK AE1/3. β-HCG staining was positive in choriocarcinoma and STGC. Patients with mature teratomas and germinomas had a better prognosis (a 5-year survival rate) than those with embryonal carcinoma and choriocarcinoma (a 5-year survival rates were 0). Our finding suggest that the incidences of primary CNS GCTs are higher in South China than in the West, but mixed GCTs are uncommon in our study. The judicious use of a panel of selected markers is helpful in diagnosing and predicting the prognosis for CNS GCTs. ",

However the specificity for cancer detection is limited because serum PSA is also elevated in patients with benign prostatic-hyperplasia (BPH) and/or prostatitis. It has been shown recently, that the ratio of free/total PSA in serum is lower in malignant prostatic disorders than in non-malignant ones and therefore might be a parameter to improve screening specificity. In a retrospective study, we tested whether free/total PSA helps to distinguish between BPH and prostatic carcinoma in men with elevated serum PSA.;A total of 266 men have been identified with age-specific elevated serum PSA levels using a conventional PSA determination kit. Subsequently their disease was proven by biopsies. Free and total PSA levels in these serum samples were measured using the DELFIA PSA dual label free/total PSA kit.;The mean free/total PSA of 64 patients with prostate cancer was 0.10 and was significantly (P = 0.001) different from the mean free/total PSA of 202 men who were histologically free of cancer, which was 0.17. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed that using a free/total PSA ratio of 0.18 as a biopsy criterion in men with an elevated PSA serum level, 37% of the negative biopsies could be eliminated while still detecting 94% of all carcinomas.;These results show that the ratio of free/total PSA is a useful determination and can improve specificity of prostate cancer screening.",

Only 5 cases have been reported so far, all being 14 mm or less, and they have yet not been investigated at the molecular level. Here, we report 2 appendiceal gastrointestinal stromal tumors in a 78-year-old woman and a 72-year-old man with a history of endometrial adenocarcinoma and urinary bladder carcinoma, respectively. The first patient had a history of pelvic irradiation. Both gastrointestinal stromal tumors were incidental findings at surgery for appendicitis-like symptoms and on follow-up for bladder carcinoma, respectively. Tumors were 5 and 25 mm and were located in the mid portion and the tip, respectively. The larger gastrointestinal stromal tumor was pedunculated. Both revealed a spindle cell histology with variable stromal hyalinization and occasional skeinoid fibers in 1 case. Immunohistochemistry showed reactivity for CD117 and CD34 and loss of p16 in both. Case 2 overexpressed the catalytic subunit of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase immunohistochemically. Molecular analysis of KIT revealed a missense mutation K558R in case 1 and an in-frame deletion I571_R588 in case 2, both in the juxtamembrane domain (exon 11). Comparative genomic hybridization was successful in case 2 (larger lesion) and revealed no chromosomal imbalance. We suggest that the molecular pathogenesis of appendiceal gastrointestinal stromal tumors beyond initiating KIT mutations might be different from their gastric and intestinal counterparts. The coincidence of loss of p16 and overexpression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase seems to be in contradiction to the small size, the benign nature, and the limited growth potential of appendiceal gastrointestinal stromal tumors.",

For p63, we used a streptavidin-biotin kit, diaminobenzidine as the chromogen, and a hematoxylin counterstain. We used automated immunostaining for TTF-1. The 37 cases included 23 SCLCs, 13 PDSCCs, and 1 carcinoma initially diagnosed as PDSCC. All 23 SCLCs were negative or, rarely, equivocal for p63; 20 (87%) of 23 were TTF-1+; nuclear staining ranged from strong and/or frequent to weak and/or uncommon. All 13 PDSCCs were TTF-1-/p63+ with intense staining of 50% to 100% of tumor cells. One case originally diagnosed as PDSCC was TTF-1+/p63-, suggestive of SCLC; after morphologic reexamination and immunostaining for neuroendocrine markers, it was reclassified as intermediate-type SCLC. TTF-1 immunostaining showed equal or increased sensitivity in alcohol-fixed cytologic cell block samples compared with formalin-fixed biopsy material; in 1 SCLC case, the biopsy specimen was TTF-1-; however, the FNA cell block stained positively. p63 and TTF-1 appear to be useful for differentiating SCLC from lung PDSCC in formalin-fixed and alcohol-fixed, formalin-postfixed material.",

In randomized controlled trials in patients with advanced, predominantly clear-cell, renal cell carcinoma, progression-free survival (PFS) and the objective response rate were significantly greater in pazopanib recipients than in placebo recipients (VEG105192 trial), and pazopanib was noninferior to sunitinib with respect to PFS (COMPARZ study).

Although careful morphologic examination using sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin will allow for the correct diagnosis in the majority of cases, there is sufficient overlap between several entities such that ancillary techniques may be necessary to arrive at the correct diagnosis. In routine diagnostic surgical pathology practice of renal tumors, immunohistochemistry is the foremost ancillary technique. Using an approach based on common histologic patterns (tumors with clear cytoplasm, granular cytoplasm, tubulopapillary architecture, spindle cell morphology, small round-cell morphology, and infiltrating poorly differentiated carcinoma), we will discuss the utility of immunohistochemistry in the differential diagnosis of renal neoplasms. In recent years, needle biopsies from renal masses are being increasingly performed. In these small biopsies, the entire range of cytoarchitectural features that are generally necessary to make a diagnosis may not be fully appreciated. Immunohistochemistry may be helpful in this setting to narrow the differential diagnosis or to arrive at a definitive diagnosis. Finally, the use of immunohistochemistry for the confirmation of metastatic renal cell carcinoma presenting at distant sites will be discussed. Panels of immunohistochemical stains are proposed for different settings, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC) marker, CD10, and vimentin to suggest renal origin of a metastatic tumor, and markers to aid in subclassification of RCC, including parvalbumin and c-kit for chromophobe RCC, and cytokeratin 7 and alpha-methyl-acyl-CoA racemase for papillary RCC.",

We report here on the very different long-term outcome of a synchronous metastatic GIST with complete remission of the primary tumor and progressive liver metastases under TKR-I therapy. In 2003, a 52-year-old patient was diagnosed with gastric GIST and synchronous multiple liver metastases. Therapy with imatinib, 400 mg daily, was started immediately. Fifteen months later, the primary was no longer detectable by endoscopy. In 2006, progression of the liver metastases was observed. Mutation analysis of the initial biopsy specimen from the primary, as well as the biopsy from the three main liver metastases after 3 years of imatinib treatment, revealed the common KIT exon 11 deletion (W557_K558del) in all tumor samples. Two of the metastases had a separate secondary mutation in KIT exon 14 and 17, respectively, while the largest cystic metastatic lesion had no other mutation. Imatinib was then increased to a daily dose of 800 mg, and in April 2007 the treatment was changed to sunitinib. Fifty-two months after initial diagnosis, the patient died of liver failure. At no time point, relapse of the gastric primary tumor was observed.

Before inducing specific differentiation by exogenously added factors, we characterized comprehensive physiological and morphological properties of ES guts. Each ES gut has a hemispherical (or cystic) structure and exhibits spontaneous contractions [mean frequency: 13.5 +/- 8.8 cycles per min (cpm)]. A dense distribution of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) was identified by c-Kit immunoreactivity, and specific subcellular structures of ICC and smooth muscle cells were identified with electron microscopy. ICC frequently formed close contacts with the neighboring smooth muscle cells and occasionally formed gap junctions with other ICC. Widely propagating intracellular Ca(2+) concentration oscillations were generated in the ES gut from the aggregates of c-Kit immunopositive cells. Plateau potentials, possibly pacemaker potentials in ICC, and electrical slow waves were recorded for the first time. These events were nifedipine insensitive, as in the mouse gut. Our present results indicate that the rhythmic pacemaker activity generated in ICC efficiently spreads to smooth muscle cells and drives spontaneous rhythmic contractions of the ES gut.

Materials and Methods: Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were used for the quantification of the cytokines. Sera were collected from 48 untreated patients (36 men and 12 women; mean age: 52.7 ± 9.8 years) and 34 healthy donors (26 men and 8 women; mean age: 53.1 ± 9.0 years). Results: Serum IL-8 level was neither significantly different between HNSCC patients and control individuals nor associated with smoking status, gender, age, tumor location, tumor grade, and stage of the patients (P > 0.05). Regarding IL-7, all control individuals had serum levels below the sensitivity of the kit (3 pg/ml), but nine patients had detectable levels, and that the mean serum IL-7 was significantly higher in the patients compared to the controls (P = 0.008). Conclusions: Serum IL-8 level is not significantly associated with HNSCC. With the sensitivity of the kit we employed, it seems that serum IL-7 levels are specifically elevated in HNSCC patients compared to healthy individuals.

Numerous reports in the literature have pointed out that cell-free DNA in plasma or serum has the clinical potential to be a more specific tumor marker for the diagnosis and prognosis, as well as the early detection, of cancer.;In order to adapt cell-free DNA to a routine clinical laboratory test, we used commercial kits such as the QIAamp blood kit for DNA extraction and the PicoGreen DNA kit for DNA quantification. This was done so our results and the normal reference value established would allow to be compared by other laboratories. We have established the normal reference level of cell-free DNA for females and males from age 20-70 years. We also detected elevated cell-free DNA in all cancers that were tested in this study, including carcinomas, leukemia and lymphoma.;Our study indicates that the elevation of serum cell-free DNA was usually detected in specimens containing elevated tumor markers and is most likely associated with tumor metastases. The electrophoretic pattern of cell-free DNA showed that cell-free DNA from cancer patient is fragmented, containing smaller DNA (100 bp) not found in normal cell-free DNA.;Measuring cell-free DNA may complement currently used tumor markers for the management of cancer patients.",

None of the fresh HCC specimens demonstrated a c-KIT mutation. CK19 positivity was significantly correlated with a positive hepatitis B core antibody, and with poor survival outcome, and tended to correlate with poor histologic differentiation.;These results suggest that: (i) about 10% of HCCs with typical histologic features originate from an intermediate hepatic progenitor cell, such as the canal of Hering and oval cells in the rat, or acquire the characteristics of cholangiocellular epithelium by metaplasia; (ii) HCC with typical histologic features rarely originates from hepatic stem cells, and (iii) patients with CK19-positive HCC have a poor prognosis.",

However, recent studies have suggested that some HCCs emerge from hepatic stem/progenitor cells because stem/progenitor cell markers and cholangiocyte markers are found in these HCCs. At the same time, the expression of stem/progenitor cell markers and cholangiocyte markers may also indicate de-differentiation and transdifferentiation of ordinary HCC cells. This study was performed to help clarify the uncertainty surrounding these HCCs.;Sixty-eight surgically resected HCC lesions no larger than 5 cm were studied immunohistochemically using a hepatocyte marker (Hepatocyte), 2 cholangiocyte markers (cytokeratins CK7 and CK19), a marker for mucin (Muc1), and a hepatic stem/progenitor cell marker (C-kit).;Hepatocyte, CK7, CK19, Muc1 and C-kit were positively stained in 68 cases (100%), 51 cases (75.0%), 15 cases (22.1%), 8 cases (11.8%) and 8 cases (11.8%), respectively. In those cases positive for CK7, CK19, Muc1 and C-kit, the positively stained cells formed small foci within a large area of negatively stained cells. Small-sized positive cells suggesting hepatic/stem cell origin were found rarely.;The positivity of cholangiocyte markers, the stem/progenitor cell marker and mucin production were thought to be due to transdifferentiation of HCC cells rather than malignant transformation of stem/progenitor cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Receptor tyrosine kinases have been extensively studied owing to their frequently abnormal activation in the development and progression of human cancers. Platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) are receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity that regulate several functions in normal cells and are widely expressed in a variety of malignancies. After the demonstration that gastrointestinal stromal tumours without c-Kit mutations harbour PDGFR-alpha-activating mutations and that PDGFR-alpha is also a therapeutic target for imatinib mesylate, the interest for this receptor has increased considerably. Because breast cancer is one of the most frequent neoplasias in women worldwide, and only one study has reported PDGFR-alpha expression in breast carcinomas, the aim of this work was to investigate the potential significance of PDGFR-alpha expression in invasive mammary carcinomas.;We used immunohistochemistry to detect PDGFR-alpha overexpression on a series of 181 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded invasive ductal breast carcinomas and in two breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7 and HS578T. We associated its expression with known prognostic factors and we also performed polymerase chain reaction-single-stranded conformational polymorphism and direct sequencing to screen for PDGFR-alpha mutations.;PDGFR-alpha expression was observed in 39.2% of the breast carcinomas and showed an association with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0079), HER-2 expression (P = 0.0265) and Bcl2 expression (P = 0.0121). A correlation was also found with the expression of platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGF-A; P = 0.0194). The two cell lines tested did not express PDGFR-alpha. Screening for mutations revealed alterations in the PDGFR-alpha gene at the following locations: 2500A-->G, 2529T-->A and 2472C-->T in exon 18 and 1701G-->A in exon 12. We also found an intronic insertion IVS17-50insA at exon 18 in all sequenced cases. None of these genetic alterations was correlated with PDGFR-alpha expression. The cell lines did not reveal any alterations in the PDGFR-alpha gene sequence.;PDGFR-alpha is expressed in invasive breast carcinomas and is associated with biological aggressiveness. The genetic alterations described were not correlated with protein expression, but other mechanisms such as gene amplification or constitutive activation of a signalling pathway inducing this receptor could still sustain PDGFR-alpha as a potential therapeutic target.",

We have investigated MC activities in colon inflammation and cancer in mice either wild-type (WT) or MC-deficient (Kit(W-sh)) reconstituted or not with bone marrow-derived MCs. Colitis was chemically induced with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Tumors were induced by administering azoxymethane (AOM) intraperitoneally before DSS. Following DSS withdrawal, Kit(W-sh) mice showed reduced weight gain and impaired tissue repair compared with their WT littermates or Kit(W-sh) mice reconstituted with bone marrow-derived MCs. MCs were localized in areas of mucosal healing rather than damaged areas where they degraded IL33, an alarmin released by epithelial cells during tissue damage. Kit(W-sh) mice reconstituted with MC deficient for mouse mast cell protease 4 did not restore normal mucosal healing or reduce efficiently inflammation after DSS withdrawal. In contrast with MCs recruited during inflammation-associated wound healing, MCs adjacent to transformed epithelial cells acquired a protumorigenic profile. In AOM- and DSS-treated WT mice, high MC density correlated with high-grade carcinomas. In similarly treated Kit(W-sh) mice, tumors were less extended and displayed lower histologic grade. Our results indicate that the interaction of MCs with epithelial cells is dependent on the inflammatory stage, and on the activation of the tissue repair program. Selective targeting of MCs for prevention or treatment of inflammation-associated colon cancer should be timely pondered to allow tissue repair at premalignant stages or to reduce aggressiveness at the tumor stage.",

Its activity against radioiodine-resistant differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) has been recently demonstrated. Patients, who were given lenvatinib, showed significantly longer median progression free survival than placebo group, 18.3 vs 3.6 months, respectively. This review is focused on lenvatinib safety profile in patients treated due to DTC and medullary thyroid carcinoma. Among the most frequent lenvatinib-related adverse events (AEs) were hypertension, proteinuria, diarrhea, appetite decrease, weight loss, nausea and stomatitis. Although a lot of them were manageable, in 35-68% of patients dose reduction was required. Nevertheless, only 15% of subjects withdrew the drug due to its toxicity.;published results of clinical trials phase II and III investigating both safety and efficacy of lenvatinib in thyroid cancer.;Lenvatinib shows acceptable safety profile in patients with thyroid carcinoma. Treatment-related side effects are usually manageable by dose modifications or by concomitant non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment.

Immunohistochemistry for HER-2/neu overexpression using the HercepTest kit (Dako Corporation, Carpenteria, CA) was employed. Two different antigen-retrieval techniques were used: 1) the standard U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved HercepTest assay and 2) a modified HercepTest, which employed an alkaline citrate buffer, pH 9.0, for antigen retrieval and a 1-hour primary antibody incubation time. The level of HER-2/neu expression was evaluated on a scale from 0 (no staining) to 3+ according to the published guidelines. Fluorescent in situ hybridization for gene amplification was performed on all specimens.;With the standard technique, only one specimen had 2+ staining, and no specimens had 3+ staining. With the modified technique, 10 specimens (26%) had 2+ staining, and 9 specimens (24%) had 3+ staining. There was a significant association between the level of HER-2/neu expression shown with the modified technique and tumor stage (P = 0.03) as well as Gleason grade (P = 0.01). None of the specimens had HER-2/neu gene amplification.;The authors report a simple modification of the HercepTest that resulted in an increased rate of HER-2/neu expression, which was correlated with poor-risk pathologic findings.

The current study attempts to evaluate the diagnostic utility of hKIM-1 in a large series of 480 neoplasms including defined subtypes of renal cell tumors, metastatic RCCs, and nonrenal tumors. Tissue microarray (TMA) sections containing 179 renal cell tumors (73 clear cell RCC, 30 papillary RCC, 16 chromophobe RCC, 15 oncocytoma, and 45 metastatic RCC) were included in this study. In addition, 80 cases of renal cell neoplasm and 221 nonrenal tumors in routine tissue sections were also included. Both TMA and routine sections were incubated with anti-hKIM-1 monoclonal antibody using an EnVision-HRP kit. The results demonstrated that a membranous/cytoplasmic staining pattern for hKIM-1 was observed in 54 of 73 (74%) clear cell RCCs and 28 of 30 (93%) papillary RCCs on TMA sections. Zero of 54 chromophobe RCCs and 4 of 41 (9.75%) oncocytomas were positive for hKIM-1 when combining TMA and routine sections. Similar staining results were observed in 35 of 45 (78%) metastatic RCCs. Data from cDNA microarray expression and Western blot demonstrated similar findings. Fifteen of 16 cases (93.8%) of clear cell carcinoma of the ovary demonstrated positive reactivity for hKIM-1. These data indicate that hKIM-1: (1) is a relatively sensitive and specific marker for papillary, clear cell, and metastatic RCCs, (2) can be used to distinguish clear cell from chromophobe RCC, and (3) may serve as a diagnostic marker for clear cell carcinoma of the ovary.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Improvements in our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer have led to the clinical development of protein kinase inhibitors, which target pivotal molecules involved in intracellular signaling pathways implicated in tumorigenesis and progression. These novel targeted agents have demonstrated activity against a wide range of solid tumors, are generally better tolerated than standard chemotherapeutics, and may revolutionize the management of advanced refractory cancer. The ubiquitous Raf serine/threonine kinases are pivotal molecules within the Raf/mitogen extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which regulates cellular proliferation and survival. Raf kinase isoforms (wild-type Raf-1 or the b-raf V600E oncogene) are overactivated in a variety of solid tumor types, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. In this review, the role of Raf in normal cells and in cancer is discussed, and an overview is given of Raf inhibitors currently in development, focusing on sorafenib tosylate (BAY 43-9006 or sorafenib). Sorafenib is the first oral multi-kinase inhibitor to be developed that targets Raf kinases (Raf-1, wild-type B-Raf, and b-raf V600E), in addition to receptor tyrosine kinases associated with angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR]-2/-3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor [PDGFR]-beta) or tumor progression (Flt-3, c-kit). Preclinical and clinical sorafenib data that led to its recent approval for the treatment of advanced RCC are summarized, along with current thinking on sorafenib's mechanism of effect on the tumor and tumor vasculature in melanoma and RCC.",

The spaces often suggested reticular or microcystic patterns of yolk sac tumor, and the solid and hollow tubular patterns often added to the diagnostic confusion. The tumors occurred in men 21 to 55 years old and on gross examination had the typical appearance of seminoma. On microscopic examination, the spaces ranged from small, closely packed and relatively regular to dilated, more dispersed and somewhat irregular. The hollow tubules appeared to result from central discohesion within nests of tumor. The spaces, particularly when large, often contained occasional tumor cells or inflammatory cells within pale edema fluid. The cytologic appearance of the cells lining the spaces, and in the surrounding tumor, retained the typical features of seminoma cells. Thirteen tumors (46%) either lacked (8 cases) or had very scant (5 cases) lymphocytes in the cystic and tubular areas, and hyaline globules were absent. Thirteen of 13 tumors were immunopositive for OCT-3/4 in the nontypical and typical areas; 9 of 10 were placental alkaline phosphatase positive, and 7 of 10 were c-Kit (CD117) positive. The same 13 cases were negative with cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and alpha-fetoprotein stains. Distinction from yolk sac tumor is aided by the observation that the spaces of yolk sac tumor are often more irregular in their individual shapes and frequently form anastomosing channels. Additionally, the spaces of yolk sac tumor randomly merge with various other yolk sac tumor patterns. The cells lining spaces in yolk sac tumor are often flattened with compressed nuclei and lack the typical prominent nucleoli of seminoma cells. Paucity of lymphocytes and intracystic edema, however, are not differentially helpful, although basophilic fluid favors yolk sac tumor. A panel of immunostains (AE1/AE3, OCT-3/4, and alpha-fetoprotein) is helpful in the differential with yolk sac tumor in especially problematic cases. The edema and paucity of lymphocytes may suggest spermatocytic seminoma, but the varied cell types of that neoplasm are absent.",

Many characteristics of type II GCT can be linked to embryonic stem cells. Intratubular germ cell neoplasia, unclassified (IGCNU) is the precursor of type II GCT and derives from undifferentiated germ cells, gonocytes, which persist in the newborn testis and escape the normal differentiation process. It is suggested that Exon-17-activated mutations of the receptor tyrosine kinase, c-KIT, occur early in germ cell development and that gonocytes with an activated c-KIT receptor are restricted in their differentiation, thereby escaping normal development.

Thyroglobulin antibodies were added to two of the sera. Two commercial kits were used by a large number of the laboratories (11 and 8, respectively). Each kit showed a reasonably low interlaboratory coefficient of variation at concentrations above 25 micrograms/l, but with discrepancy between the methods. The remaining miscellaneous methods (24) showed a variation above 65% in all samples. In all laboratories the addition of thyroglobulin antibodies resulted in false thyroglobulin measurements with either elevated or depressed levels.

The candidate proteins include p53, EGFR, c-KIT, TIMP1 and PI3K-p110α reported to be altered in ESCC tissues as well as another important component of PI3K, PI3K-p85α. Of the six proteins tested, p53, EGFR, c-KIT, TIMP1 and PI3K-p85α were detected with high expression in 43.0%, 36.6%, 55.9%, 70.7% and 57.1% of tumors, respectively.

The native cancerous MUC1 protein was purified from ascites fluid of a patient suffering from small cell lung carcinoma by immunoaffinity chromatography and used as a standard preparation in the assay buffer. The standard curve was constructed following a competitive procedure in the range of 0-200 U/mL. The level of MUC1 in normal and cancerous samples was compared following this procedure and using available CA15-3 EIA (Can Ag), as well as LIAISON CA15-3 commercial kits. The correlation coefficient between the procedure reported in this work (MRP83-CA15-3) and CA15-3 EIA (Can Ag) was 0.68 and was 0.95 with the LIAISON CA15-3 kit.

A 69-year-old man was admitted to our clinic complaining of rectal bleeding and weight loss. Colonoscopy showed an ulcerative bleeding mass located about 8 cm from the anal verge. Abdominal and pelvis CT scans demonstrated a large low-density lesion with extracanalicular growth from the middle rectum, with local lymph-node spread, and without tumour infiltration of other pelvic organs, or evidence of distant intra-abdominal spread. The patient underwent a low anterior resection for rectal cancer together with wide resection of lymph nodes. In immunohistochemical analysis, pankeratin and Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) immunolabeling proved the epithelial nature of the tumor cells. Chromogranin A and Leukocyte Common Antigen (LCA) were negative, whereas CD-56 expression was scanty and Neuron Specific Enolase (NSA) was heavily and diffusely expressed. Ki67 immunoexpression was particularly increased. Interestingly, the intense c-kit immunoreactivity (100%) was a common feature. The above phenotypic and immunohistochemical profile was consistent with an anaplastic carcinoma of the large intestine, with focal neuroendocrine differentiation and diffuse immunoreactivity to c-kit protein.

Carcinoma in situ cells will develop into invasive seminoma/nonseminoma. Gonadoblastoma (GB) is the precursor of invasive GCTs in dysgenetic gonads, predominantly dysgerminoma (DG). In this process, part of the Y chromosome (GBY region) is involved, for which TSPY is a candidate gene. A detailed immunohistochemical survey was performed for the known diagnostic markers, germ cell/placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), c-KIT, and OCT3/4, as well as testis-specific protein on the Y chromosome (TSPY) on a series of GBs, and adjacent invasive DGs. All 5 patients were XY individuals (4 females and 1 male). In contrast to c-KIT, PLAP was positive in all cases. The immature germ cells of GBs were positive for OCT3/4, whereas the mature germ cells were negative for this marker, but positive for TSPY. In every GB, a minor population of germ cells positive for both markers could be identified, similar to most CIS cells and early invasive DG. On progression to an invasive tumor, TSPY can be lost, a process that is also detectable in invasive testicular GCTs compared to CIS. These results indicate that GB is a heterogeneous mix of germ cells, in which the OCT3/4-positive cells have the potential to undergo progression to an invasive tumor. These early invasive stages are initially also positive for TSPY (like CIS), supporting a positive selection mechanism. Therefore, OCT3/4 in combination with TSPY is valuable to identify malignant germ cells in dysgenetic gonads. This could allow better prediction of the risk of progression to a GCT. In addition, the data support the model that GB represents the earliest accessible developmental stage of malignant GCTs.",

One hundred eleven frozen samples of carcinoma and normal breast tissue were analyzed. Tumor and normal tissue morphology were confirmed by frozen sections. Tissue type, tissue treatment (Allprotect vs. no Allprotect), extraction kit, and nucleic acid quantification were analyzed by utilizing a 4 factorial design (SPSS PASW 18 Statistics Software(®)). QIAamp (DNA isolation), AllPrep (DNA, RNA, and Protein isolation), and RNeasy (RNA isolation) kits were assessed and compared. Mean DNA yield and A(260/280) values using QIAamp were 33.2 ng/μL and 1.86, respectively, and using AllPrep were 23.2 ng/μL and 1.94. Mean RNA yield and RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values with RNeasy were 73.4 ng/μL and 8.16, respectively, and with AllPrep were 74.8 ng/μL and 7.92. Allprotect-treated tissues produced higher RIN values of borderline significance (P=0.055). No discernible loss of RNA stability was detected after 6 h incubation of stabilized or nonstabilized tissues at room temperature or 4°C or in 9 freeze-thaw cycles.

Although immunohistochemistry is widely applied, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technology shows its advantage in discriminating tumors in an objective manner. More recently, development of LightCycler technology permits evaluation of gene amplification with a small volume of DNA run in a 20 microL glass capillary. In this study, a series of 87 breast carcinomas were chosen for evaluation of c-erbB-2/neu gene amplification detected by both LightCycler technology and FISH. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in LightCycler capillaries with 10 ng sample DNA. By using LightCycler Relative Quantification Software version 1 (LightCycler, Roche, Mannheim, Germany), the amount of c-erbB-2 DNA was calculated as a ratio of c-erbB-2/reference gene quantity in a sample, and then the ratio was divided by the ratio of c-erbB-2 gene/reference gene quantities of a calibrator DNA (a standard DNA provided in the kit), which was run with each sample reaction in parallel. Dual-color FISH was performed on sections of the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue array samples using the DAKO HER2 FISH pharmDX kit (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Danmark) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry was performed in parallel, with both the NCL-CB11 and HercepTest antibodies. Both the FISH technology and the LightCycler-PCR identified a similar percentage of tumors with c-erbB-2 gene amplification in our present study, 16% (14/87) and 15% (13/87), respectively, whereas immunohistochemistry demonstrated 32% and 34% c-erbB-2 overexpression with the NCL-CB11 and HercepTest antibodies, respectively. In addition, FISH and PCR were highly correlated in detecting tumors mainly with 3+++ c-erbB-2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry, indicating that LightCycler real-time quantification of c-erbB-2 gene may be an alternative to FISH in breast cancer clinical application.",

In some patients, however, the result of postoperative assessment of a permanent section differs from the result obtained intraoperatively. In this study we explored methods of improving the accuracy of intraoperative pathological assessment. Of the patients who underwent surgery for gastric cancer at Takarazuka Municipal Hospital, between April 2000 and July 2001, intraoperative pathological assessment of the resection margin was performed in 34 because it could not be accurately defined preoperatively. The intraoperative assessment consisted of touch smear cytological examination and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and cytokeratin (CK) histological examination. The time required to perform cytological examination and HE and CK immunohistochemistry by this modified method, which uses an ENVISION Kit/HRP, was approximately 20 minutes for each procedure. Touch smear cytological examination gave false positive results in 3 of 34 patients (8.8%). Of the 14 patients preoperatively diagnosed with signet-ring cell carcinoma, intraoperative HE histological analysis yielded a false negative result in one (7.1%). The results of CK histological assessment of these patients were all consistent with those of postoperative examination of permanent sections. Of the 20 patients preoperatively diagnosed with non-signet-ring cell carcinoma, HE analysis yielded a false negative result in one (5%). The results of CK histological assessment of these patients were all consistent with those of postoperative examination of permanent sections. Our modified CK staining method with the ENVISION Kit/HRP allows intraoperative pathological assessment to be performed accurately and rapidly.

Recent studies indicate that OX40/OX40L system mediates the adhesion and infiltration of adult T cell leukemia (ATL). Previously, we detected OX40 expression in breast carcinoma cell lines and tissues. The correlation of expression of OX40 and OX40L and clinical features in breast carcinogenesis, however, has not been well characterized. The expression of OX40 and OX40L in 107 invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCa), 9 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS), and 31 fibroadenomas from breast tissues and its relationship with the clinical features were determined using immunohistochemistry (peroxidase-conjugated polymer method, ChemMate™ Envision™ Detection kit). The positive immunostaining rates for OX40 in IDCa, DCIS and fibroadenomas from breast tissues were 85.0%, 66.7% and 38.7% respectively, showing a significant difference in OX40 expression among IDCa, DCIS and fibroadenoma of breast (z=5.206, P=0.001). Increased staining intensity of OX40 was associated with TNM stages (z=2.112, P=0.017). Meanwhile, a relation of OX40 expression with lymph node metastatic status in IDCa was found (P=0.041). The expression of OX40L did not show any obvious difference among IDCa, DCIS and fibroadenomas from breast tissues. OX40L expression was also not related to histopathological parameters in IDCa except for progesterone receptor (PR) being positive (P=0.005). However, a high coincidental positive rate for OX40 and OX40L was observed in biopsy samples with IDCa (P=0.017, Kappa=0.231). The present results suggest that high OX40 expression may be associated with malignant transformation, progression, invasion and metastasis in breast cancer biology.",

Cholangiocarcinoma [Web page]. emedicine from WebMD, http://www.emedicine.com/med/TOPIC343.HTM , accessed July 22, 2008). Currently, the only treatment option that offers a potential for cure is radical surgical resection. Typically, only 30% of patients qualify for this, while, for the remainder, treatment is only palliative (Chabner BA et al. Harrison's manual of oncology. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2008). Sorafenib is an oral-targeted agent that acts as a multikinase inhibitor and competitively inhibits the Raf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), VEGFR3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, Flt3, and C-KIT receptors (Chabner BA et al. Harrison's manual of oncology. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2008). It has demonstrated effective clinical antitumor activity in both renal cell and inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma gaining Food and Drug Administration approval for the latter carcinoma in November 2007. Its role in advanced cholangiocarcinoma is yet to be defined.;Two female patients with biopsy-proven multifocal moderately differentiated cholangiocarcinoma received single-agent sorafenib at standard doses.;Both patients derived benefit in the form of disease stabilization with negligible cancer-related side effects lasting 4+ months.

        "Doc_abstract":"The typical progression of oral cancer is from hyperplastic epithelial lesions through dysplasia to invasive carcinoma. It is important to investigate malignant oral cancer progression and development in order to determine useful approaches of prevention of dysplastic lesions. The present study aimed to gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanism of oral carcinogenesis by establishing a rat model of oral carcinogenesis using 4‑nitroquinoline 1‑oxide. Subsequently, transcription profile analysis using an integrating microarray was performed. The dynamic gene expression changes of the six stages of rat oral carcinogenesis (normal, mild epithelial dysplasia, moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ and oral squamous cell carcinomas) were analyzed using component plane presentations (CPP)‑self‑organizing map (SOM). Six genes were verified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity assay kit. Numerous differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified during rat oral carcinogenesis. CPP‑SOM determined that these DEGs were primarily enriched during cell cycle, apoptosis, inflammatory response and tricarboxylic acid cycle, indicating the coordinated regulation of molecular networks. In addition, the expression of specific DEGs, such as janus kinase 3, cyclin‑dependent kinase A‑1, B‑cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/lymphoma 2‑like 2, nuclear factor‑κB, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A, cyclin D1 and SDH were identified to have high concordance with the results from microarray data. The current study demonstrated that oral carcinogenesis is a multi‑step and multi‑gene process, with a distinct pattern alteration along a continuum of malignant transformation. In addition, this comprehensive investigation provided a theoretical basis for the understanding of the molecular alterations associated with oral carcinogenesis.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common solid cancers, representing the third cause of cancer-related death among cirrhotic patients. Treatment of advanced HCC has become a very active area of research. Perifosine, a new synthetic alkylphospholipid Akt inhibitor, has shown anti-tumor activity by inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. In this study, the effect of perifosine on the cell proliferation and apoptosis in hepatoma cells has been investigated. Cell growth inhibition was detected by MTT assay, cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry, AnnexinV-FITC apoptosis detection kit was used to detect cell apoptosis, and protein expression was examined by Western blotting analysis. Our present studies showed that Akt phosphorylation was inhibited by perifosine in HepG2 and Bel-7402 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Perifosine inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells and Bel-7402 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and arrested cell cycle progression at the G(2) phase. Apoptosis induction became more effective with increasing perifosine concentration. The caspase cascade and its downstream effectors, Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), were also activated simultaneously upon perifosine treatment. The proapoptotic effect of perifosine was in part depending on regulation of the phosphorylation level of ERK and JNK. Perifosine cotreatment substantially increased cytotoxic effects of cisplatin in HepG2 cells. Down-regulating the expression of Bcl-2 and up-regulating the level of Bax may be the potential mechanism for this synergistic effect. Our findings suggest that the small molecule Akt inhibitor perifosine shows substantial anti-tumor activity in human hepatoma cancer cell lines, and is a good candidate for treatment combinations with classical cytostatic compounds in hepatocellular carcinoma.",

The antibodies spotted are specific for proteins important in various areas of cell signaling such as phosphorylation, cell cycle, apoptosis, nuclear signaling and cytoskeleton proteins. Furthermore, for some of the protein targes, the Panorama Ab Microarray can detect phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the traget protein. We found that treatment of the slides post-spotting is important for the array performance (ratio of signal to background) and its stability. Panorama Ab Microarray was used to analyze changes in protein expression in F9 embryonic carcinoma cells stimulated to differentiate by all-trans retinoic acid. We found that the level of several proteins, among them cell cycle regulators and kineases, was either up- or down-regulated.

In order to elucidate a possible role of signal transduction systems (cAMP-A-kinase, diacyglycerol-C-kinase and Ca(2+)-calmodulin) in the regulation of TA-4 production and secretion by human cervical epidermoid carcinoma cells, the effects of cholera toxin (CT), an activator of adenylate cyclase, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a protein kinase C activator, and Ca2+ ionophore A23187, an activator of Ca2+ modulation on TA-4 production and secretion by CaSki cells were evaluated. TA-4 in the cultured cells and media were measured with a SCC RIA-Kit. The addition of PMA or Ca2+ ionophore to the medium caused increases in the cellular levels of TA-4 and TA-4 levels in the medium in a dose-dependent manner shortly after the addition. Combined treatment with PMA and Ca2+ ionophore did not cause additive increases in TA-4 levels in the cells and medium compared to the treatment with PMA alone or Ca2+ ionophore alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

This glycoprotein is a new, interesting serum marker that reflects the immune reaction of the host against certain viral infections and tumors such as breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most widespread tumors in the world. AFP is currently the most useful marker for HCC, in spite of its poor diagnostic sensitivity. In this study 40 cirrhotic HCC patients were enrolled. The prevalence of viral hepatic infections in this group was 73% for HCV, 8% for HBV, and 8% for both viruses. Thirteen percent of the patients showed non-virus-related liver damage. 90K serum levels were assayed by an ELISA kit and AFP levels by a chemiluminescent enzyme immunometric system. The overall survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, taking into account age, sex, 90K and AFP serum levels. Statistical analysis showed a highly significant influence on overall survival of age below 70 years and 90K serum levels below the cutoff of 14 ng/mL.

A better understanding of the pathogenesis and tumor biology of sporadic renal cell carcinoma has led to the approval of 6 drug regimens: 3 oral multi-targeted tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (sorafenib, sunitinib, and pazopanib), 2 inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (temsirolimus and everolimus), and 1 monoclonal antibody against the vascular endothelial growth factor (bevacizumab). Pazopanib, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets VEGFR-1, -2, and-3; PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β, and c-Kit, was approved for the treatment of mRCC in October 2009, several years after the other drugs in its class. The efficacy and safety of pazopanib in Phase I, II, and III trials will be examined and its role in mRCC treatment will be described. Future studies that may clarify pazopanib's role in mRCC will be discussed. Based on pazopanib's demonstrated efficacy in treatment-naïve and cytokine-refractory patients, along with a seemingly favorable toxicity profile compared with other multi-targeted tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, pazopanib may have a unique niche in the armamentarium of treatment options for mRCC.

None of the normal samples were aneusomic. Gain of chromosomes 3, 7 and 17 constituted the majority of positive cases. Proper destaining and slight decrease in stringency wash conditions enabled reliable detection of signals in archival cases.;Routine ThinPrep slides can be used for multicolor interphase FISH analysis of urine cytology specimens.

Seeking a potential correlation, we investigated tumor cell apoptosis, proliferation, and angiogenesis in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence of colorectal carcinogenesis using an in situ apoptosis detection kit and MIB-1 and anti-CD34 antibodies in 27 adenomas with low dysplasia, 17 adenomas with high dysplasia, and 26 carcinomas in adenoma, as well as assessed p53 and bcl-2 expressions. The results showed that the potential for apoptosis was augmented, paralleling the increment of proliferation, in adenomas with low dysplasia but diminished when adenomas progressed from low dysplasia to high dysplasia and cancer. A gradual increment of microvessel density was observed during the progression with an increase during transition from low dysplasia to high dysplasia and cancer. Correlation coefficient test showed an inverse correlation between apoptotic index and microvessel density when all of the lesions were taken into account. No apparent impact of aberrant p53 on angiogenesis or bcl-2 on apoptosis was observed in this study. These results suggest that the angiogenesis initiates during transition from low dysplasia to high dysplasia and cancer, which may, in turn, contribute to the reduction of tumor cell apoptosis during colorectal carcinogenesis.",

The material was tested, alongside HercepTest kit cell lines (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), by 7 breast cancer centers in the United Kingdom and France with different immunohistochemical assays and markers. The cell lines also were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) by 2 centers using HER-2/neu kits. FISH produced 100% agreement between the 2 centers: SKOV-3 and MDA-MB-453 showed HER-2/neu amplification and BT-20 and MCF-7 did not. Immunohistochemical analysis and a common evaluation method produced 100% agreement that SKOV-3 and MCF-7 showed 3+ and zero HER-2/neu overexpression, respectively. For MDA-MB-453, there was 71% (5/7) concordance of 2+ immunohistochemical staining and 86% (6/7) concordance of zero or 1 + staining for BT-20.

However, intracranial GCTs are often of mixed histologic composition (mixed GCTs), and only germinoma and teratoma are likely to be encountered as pure tumor types. Although GCTs are usually identified using conventional histological techniques, immunohistochemical studies are very useful for delineating these entities, using special markers such as human chorionic gonadotropin, alpha-fetoprotein, human placental alkaline phosphatase, cytokeratin, as well as c-kit and OCT4. Ultrastructural examination is also useful in confirming the identity of these tumors. Genetic alterations specifically encountered in central nervous system GCTs are largely unknown. Patients with Klinefelter syndrome or Down syndrome appear to be predisposed to the development of gonadal as well as intracranial germinomas. Frequent imbalances of chromosomes have been described in intracranial GCTs, including chromosomes 1, 8, 12, 13, 18 and X.

In this study, we obtained MCCs from 21 elderly patients (19 women, 2 men) and analyzed their DNA for mutation of exons of interest in several tumor-suppressor genes or oncogenes known to be frequently mutated in skin cancer: p53 (exons 4-8), Ras (exons 1 and 2), c-Kit (exon 11), and the INK4a-ARF locus (encoding p14 and p16) (exons 1 and 2). Direct sequence analysis revealed p53 mutations (that is, at codons 224, 234, and 294) in three tumors (14%) and p16INK4a mutations (that is, at codon 6) in one (5%). No mutations were detected in Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras, N-Ras, c-Kit, or p14ARF. On the other hand, methylation-specific PCR revealed methylation of p14ARF promoter DNA in eight of 19 analyzable tumor samples (42%) and p16INK4a promoter DNA in one of 19 analyzable tumor samples (5%). Together, these findings suggest that p14ARF silencing may be an important mechanism in MCC tumorigenesis, and thus a potential target for therapeutic intervention in this highly aggressive tumor type.",

We compared COBAS with previously validated PCR TaqMan and High Resolution Melting (HRM) assays on 156 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens of colorectal carcinoma. DNA extraction procedures, using the Qiagen QiAMP kit and the Roche COBAS DNA kit, were also compared. Of the 156 samples, 132 were interpretable using COBAS and TaqMan and 92 using COBAS and HRM. No statistically significant difference was found between COBAS/TaqMan and COBAS/HRM (k = 0.937; p < 0.001 - four discordant cases were found, mostly concerning codon 61 mutations and k = 0.891; p < 0.001 - five discordant cases were found, three regarding codon 61 and two on codon 12/13, respectively). No difference was found between the two DNA extraction methods (t = 1.7185; dol = 39; α = 5 %). The three assays were found suitable to detect accurately KRAS mutations in colon FFPE specimens. COBAS and TaqMan were found to be more robust than HRM, as they yielded fewer non-interpretable results. DNA extraction kits were found to provide equivalent results.

Histopathological and laboratory diagnostics are unspecific in the majority of the cases and the diagnosis is made in accordance with the clinical picture. Here, we report the case of a 69-year old man with progredient pyoderma gangrenosum-like ulcerations under treatment with sunitinib due to hepatocellular carcinoma. A conventional ulcer therapy did not lead to a regression of the lesions. Solely cessation of sunitinib therapy resulted in an improvement of the ulcerations. Sunitinib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets the PDGF-α- and ?β-, VEGF-1-3-, KIT-, FLT3-, CSF-1- and RET-receptor, thereby impairing tumour proliferation, pathological angiogenesis and metastasation. Here, we demonstrate that pyoderma gangrenosum-like ulcers may represent a serious side effect of sunitinib-based anti-cancer treatment.",

The results then were analyzed in comparison with other prognostic variables and a model predicting overall survival (OS) and time to disease progression (TTP) was generated.;Elevated levels of serum IL-10 were found in carcinoma patients compared with healthy controls (19.6 +/- 6.8 pg/mL vs. 9.2 +/- 1.5 pg/mL; P < 0.0001), with those patients with metastatic disease showing significantly higher levels than patients with undisseminated disease (21.9 +/- 6. 7 pg/mL vs. 15.5 +/- 3.6 pg/mL; P = 0.0003). Retrospective analysis of prechemotherapy IL-10 serum levels showed a significant difference between responders and nonresponders (15.8 +/- 2.5 pg/mL vs. 21.6 +/- 7.6 pg/mL; P < 0.0001). Moreover, a further significant increase in IL-10 serum levels was observed in nonresponders at the end of therapy (21.6 +/- 7.6 pg/mL prechemotherapy vs. 31.3 +/- 11.6 pg/mL postchemotherapy; P < 0.0001) whereas no significant differences were observed in responders. Using univariate analysis, both OS and TTP were shown to be affected by the median pathologic levels of IL-10; multivariate analysis related to OS and TTP identified performance status and IL-10 serum level as the relevant prognostic factors, respectively. Finally, stepwise regression analysis identified IL-10 serum level and metastases as the prognostic factors related to both OS and TTP.;The results of the current study show that measurement of pretreatment serum levels of IL-10 is of independent prognostic utility in patients with advanced gastrointestinal carcinoma and may be useful for the detection of disease progression.",

Classical methods of prognostication, as FIGO stage and histopathologic grade, could be improved by applying additional techniques, utilizing molecular biology and immunochemistry. p-53 tumor suppressor gene, the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers has been shown to play an important role in the biology of gynecologic carcinomas. Angiogenesis, a process of formation of new vessels, being connected to tumors progression and metastatic potential was shown to be linked with tumor suppressor genes expression. The aim of the study was to evaluate relationships between intensity of tumor angiogenesis, serum levels of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and tissue p-53 protein expression in endometrial adenocarcinoma. Angiogenic Point's Density (APD) was calculated in hot spots areas using the morphometric appliance. For detection of p53 protein in tumor samples, LSAB + Kit Alkaline Phosphatase (DAKO) was used. VEGF levels were assessed in patient's blood sampled before the operation. Overexpression of p53 protein was found in tumor tissue in 35.2% of cases and mean angiogenic points density was greater in p53 positive cases. Serum levels of VEGF were above the cut off level in 54.5% of patients, in those cases angiogenesis was also elevated. In cases of p53 overexpression, VEGF levels tended to be greater as compared with p53 negative cases. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that angiogenesis was more intensive in p53 positive cases, confirming the hypothesis of tumor suppressor-gene regulation of the process of neovascularization. Serum levels of VEGF were borderline-significantly higher in cases of p53 overexpression, they were also correlated to the angiogenesis. Joint assessment of angiogenesis and tumor suppressor genes expression may contribute to reliable evaluation of the biology of endometrial carcinoma.",

We report here on four cases in which there was an unusual association with other rare neoplasms.;Overall, four of the 300 observed cases (1.3%) showed an unusual association with rare nonepithelial neoplasms: (1) gastric carcinoid and glioblastoma multiforme; (2) Merkel cell tumor and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; (3) medullary thyroid carcinoma, yolk sac tumor of the testis and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST); (4) gastric carcinoid and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).;There cases are of interest not only from an epidemiological point of view, but also offer insight into possible geno-phenotypical implications. The c-kit expression, typical of GISTs but observed also in other epithelial and neuroendocrine tumors, not only broadens the possibility to gain insight into the carcinogenesis of these neoplasms, but also opens the field to possible new therapeutic opportunities using multitargeted molecules. The contemporaneous presence of other lesions, such as the Merkel cell tumor and the squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can be interpreted as an answer by the cell to the same mutagenic stimulus. In other cases, where a possible link is not yet found which could explain the synchronism or metachronism of low incidence neoplasms, it remains possible that the associations are entirely coincidental.

The uterine cervical squamous carcinoma CaSki cells were cultured for 72 h after 3 h exposure to 5.0 microg/ml CDDP. The effects of CDDP exposure on the proliferative activity and apoptosis in cultured CaSki cells were determined by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake and cell counting and by the TUNEL assay, respectively. SCC Ag levels in cultured CaSki cells and culture media were determined with the use of SCC-RIA kit. The expression of SCC Ag-1 mRNA and SCC Ag-2 mRNA in cultured CaSki cells was assessed using semiquantitative RT-PCR with Southern blot analysis. The number of BrdU-positive CaSki cells significantly decreased 6 h after exposure to CDDP, whereas the apoptosis-positive rate of cultured CaSki cells significantly increased 12 h after the CDDP exposure. The number of cultured CaSki cells significantly decreased 72 h after the CDDP exposure. The total SCC Ag protein levels in both cultured CaSki cells and the culture media after the 3-hour CDDP exposure increased in a time-dependent manner during the subsequent incubation for 48 h. Semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed that the expression levels of both SCC Ag-1 and SCC Ag-2 mRNA increased (1.7- and 2.7-fold, respectively) 12 h after the exposure to CDDP relative to those before the subsequent cultures. Exposure of uterine cervical squamous carcinoma CaSki cells to CDDP resulted in a transient increase in SCC Ag protein and mRNA expression in those cells during the initial 12 h after the exposure, being associated with decreased proliferative activity and increased apoptosis of those cells.",

Hoechst 33258 staining and an Annexin V/PI apoptosis kit were used to detect the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. Western blotting was used to investigate the essential mechanism underlying SIN and 5-FU-induced apoptosis.

To correctly classify a tumour process, it is essential not only to define its histological typology and identify its biological character but, at the same time, using immunohistochemistry and diagnostic molecular pathology, to evaluate prognostic and predictive indicators. As regards the prognostic indicators, it is mainly grading and staging as part of the TNM system, the sentinel lymph node assessment, if it is assessed, and other nodes extracted in this context. Histological specimens of invasive carcinomas and skin melanomas are assessed with respect to the depth of the invasion. Endocrine oestrogen and progesterone receptors are assessed in endocrine-dependent breast carcinomas. Predictive pathology uses biomarkers; biomarkers confirm the presence of target molecules following their reaction with the administered small molecule-like drugs, usually protein kinases or antibodies. HER2 gene amplification is estimated using the FISH method and predicts effectiveness of breast cancer therapies. In patients with a colon carcinoma, HER1 oncogene is identified immunohistochemically and the presence of a mutated K-ras is subsequently tested using the RT-PCR technique. CD 117 (c-kit) expression is determined in gastrointestinal stromal tumour and CD 20, 33 and 52 in malignant lymphomas and leukaemias. The most difficult task for a pathologist is defining the primary focus of the tumour in cases where only a fraction of a metastasis is available for examination. Nevertheless, at present, it is feasible to track the tumour differentiation down and, using an antibody battery, particularly against specific cytokeratines and vimentine and including organ-specific markers, to identify the primary source or at least to establish an assumption about the most likely organ affected by the tumour process.",

Thirty-three hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) associated with nonbiliary cirrhosis and 24 ICC without cirrhosis were used as controls. Prominent neutrophilic infiltration was frequent in ICC with cirrhosis (78%) and ICC elements of combined HC-CC (72%). Neutrophilic infiltration-related cytokines (interleukin 8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) were expressed frequently and intensely in carcinoma cells of ICC with cirrhosis (40%, 80%, and 60%, respectively) and in ICC elements of the combined one (13%, 38%, and 63%, respectively). Interleukin 8 was expressed in 18% of ICC without cirrhosis, irrespective of neutrophilic infiltration. Neutrophilic infiltration and expression of G-CSF and GM-CSF were in parallel (P < 0.05). G-CSF and GM-CSF mRNA were detected by RT-PCR in tissue specimens expressing G-CSF and GM-CSF at the protein level.

We performed univariate and multivariate analyses with linear regression models.;The mean age at the first KRL assessment was 12.2 ± 3.8 years. Factors that correlated with decreased antioxidant capacity were mostly related to the severity of pulmonary disease [ forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1), acute exacerbation, and congestion. In multivariate analysis, the correlation between Brasfield score and erythrocyte antioxidant potential remained significant (β = - 0.611, p < 0.001). Among nutritional factors, the ω6/ω3 ratio was significantly correlated to erythrocyte antioxidant potential (β = - 1.213, p = 0.01).;The blood antioxidant capability, measured by the KRL test, appears to be an interesting biomarker to evaluate oxidative stress in CF. This study suggests that the ω6/ω3 ratio should be regarded as a nutritional marker in antioxidant management in CF children.",

Following a diagnosis of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), partial resection of the stomach was performed in January 2003. The tumor was immunohistochemically positive for c-kit and CD34. The tumor size was 6.5 x 5.0 x 4.5 cm with a mitotic index of 25 out of 50 in the high-power field. The pathological diagnosis indicated a high-risk GIST. Treatment with imatinib at a dose of 400 mg/day was started because of liver metastasis of the GIST in January 2004. The liver metastasis was gradually reduced and exhibited cystic change. We considered that there was a complete response without accumulation by FDG-PET in June 2007. An hepatic segmentectomy was performed and imatinib was discontinued in July 2007. Most intratumorale in the specimen underwent hyaline degeneration after pathological examination, but there were viable cells in a portion of the tumor border. Imatinib treatment was resumed because of recurrence in the remnant stomach four months postoperatively owing to imatinib withdrawal. In making a diagnosis at the cell level by FDG-PET, it was difficult to determine the effectiveness of imatinib, and therefore, it is suggested that imatinib treatment must be continued after surgical resection.",

Stimulation of PMN or AM increases LPO of Curosurf and cell wall lipids. In both types of phagocytes, B. cepacia induced the highest LPO levels followed by P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia. PMN, stimulated by live bacteria, induced higher LPO than those stimulated by heat-killed bacteria. B. cepacia stimulated AM to produce more superoxide and NO than did P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia.

The overall frequency of large deletions in patients with CF is estimated to be 1-3%. Using the CFTR Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification Kit (MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, Netherlands) that allows the exact detection of copy numbers from all 27 exons in the CFTR gene, we screened 50 patients with only one identified mutation for large deletions in the CFTR gene. Each detected deletion was confirmed using our real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and deletion-specific PCR reactions using junction fragment primers. We detected large deletions in eight patients (16%). These eight CF alleles belong to four different deletion types (CFTRindel2, CFTRdele14b-17b, CFTRdele17a-17b and CFTRdele 2-9) whereof the last is novel. Comparing detailed clinical data of all these patients with CF and the molecular genetic findings, we were able to elaborate criteria for deletion screenings and possible genotype-phenotype associations.

Newborn infants with CF have raised levels of immuno-reactive trypsinogen (IRT) in their serum. Measurement of IRT in the first week of life has enabled CF to be incorporated into existing newborn screening (NBS) blood spot protocols. However, IRT is not a specific test for CF and NBS therefore requires a further tier of tests to avoid unnecessary referral for diagnostic testing. Following identification of the CFTR gene, DNA analysis for common CF-associated mutations has been increasingly used as a second tier test. The aim of this study was to survey the current practice of CF NBS programmes in Europe.;A questionnaire was sent to 26 regional and national CF NBS programmes in Europe.;All programmes responded. The programmes varied in number of infants screened and in the protocols employed, ranging from sweat testing all infants with a raised first IRT to protocols with up to four tiers of testing. Three different assays for IRT were used; in the majority (24) this was a commercially available kit (Delfia). A number of programmes employed a second IRT measurement in the 4th week of life (as the IRT is more specific at this point). Nineteen programmes used DNA analysis for common CFTR mutations on samples with a raised first IRT. Three programmes used a second IRT measurement on infants with just one recognised mutation to reduce the number of infants referred for sweat testing. Referral to clinical services was prompt and diagnosis was confirmed by sweat testing, even in infants with two recognised mutations in most programmes. Subsequent clinical pathways were less uniform. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a relationship between the age of diagnosis and the timing of the first IRT. More sweat tests were undertaken if the first IRT was earlier and the diagnosis was later.;Annually these programmes screen approximately 1,600,000 newborns for CF and over 400 affected infants are recognised. The findings of this survey will guide the development of European evidence based guidelines and may help new regions or nations in the development and implementation of NBS for cystic fibrosis.",

The results from the participants show a large variation in the precision of the methods used as well as in the comparability of results between methods for the same analyte. In general, the hormones used as tumour markers show better performance than the \"CA-markers\", which are often inadequately standardised and defined. In the case of one CA-marker (CA 72-4/TAG 72-4), the differences between the lowest kit median concentration and highest kit median concentration for one sample pair were 440% and 580%. The corresponding figures for ACTH were 123% and 156% and for CEA 180% and 184%. The classical tumour markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and alpha foetoprotein (AFP) performed markedly better than the CA-markers and PSA with regards to both inter- and intra-method comparability. The inter-laboratory precision for a given kit and marker was acceptable in many cases. The results show that only results from the same kit/method for each tumour marker can be used for cumulative or time-dependent comparison of results - for example pre-operative and post-operative follow up. In the case of prostate specific antigen (PSA), the kits used for free and total PSA must come from the same producer, if the generally accepted ratios are to have any diagnostic value. The need for kit- and laboratory-specific reference ranges and cut-off values for setting diagnostic specificity and sensitivity is highlighted from the EQA-results. The situation for inter-method comparability for the CA-Markers has not improved over the past decade. With the exception of calcitonin for detecting medullary thyroid carcinoma, chorionic gonadotropin in germ-cell tumours in men and thyroglobulin after total thyroidectomy, none of the remaining analytes appear to be suitable for screening purposes.",

The present non-invasive examination methods for the assessment of liver fibrosis also have a problem in the fields of organ specificity and diagnostic performance. Using a fully automated immunoassay system \"HISCL\", an assay system based on the lectin bound sugar reaction which is not an antigen-bound antibody reaction was developed. Measurements using the fully automated immunoassay system \"HISCL\" series and HISCL M2BPGi assay kit facilitated rapid assay (17 minutes) with a small sample volume (10 μL). Serum M2BPGi values can be used in various ways, such as for assessment of the risk and treatment associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, reflecting the liver fibrosis stage.

The aim of this study was to produce lambda (λ) bacteriophage displaying high-affinity nanobody against HER-2 expressing breast carcinoma cells. Bacteriophage λ is a temperate phage with inherent biological safety in mammalian cells. Here we report the construction of a recombinant λ phage that efficiently expresses specific nanobody towards third domain of HER-2 target on SKBR-3 and MCF-7 cell lines in vitro. We constructed recombinant λ phage particles containing a mammalian expression cassette, C-Myc tagged, encoding VHH gene of camelid anti HER-2 third domain epitope using λ ZAP-cytomegalic virus (CMV) vector. The SKBR-3, MCF-7 and human endometrial stem cells were treated by the nanobody displayed recombinant λ phage. The cell growth inhibition assay was performed by MTT Cell Viability Assay Kit. After the fourth round of biopanning there was a significant enrichment in the phage specifically binding to the antigen. The ratio of targeted phage increased approximately 1,000-fold in the fifth round. The nanobody expressed by λ ZAP-CMV-VHH phagemid cloned in λ bioparticles significantly inhibited the proliferation of HER-2 positive SKBR-3 and MCF-7 cells. Recombinant bacteriophage λ ZAP-CMV-VHH-cDNA could be used efficiently for construction of nanobodies to mortify HER-2 positive breast carcinoma cells as a nanomedical therapeutic.",

Apoptosis were detected through acridine orange (AO) and ethylene dibromide (EB) staining and DNA fragmentation assay. The effect of CSE on the cell cycle of HepG2 cells was studied by the propidium iodide staining method. The activation of caspases-3, -8 and -9 was examined by immunoassay kits. The transcription of the Bcl-2 family and p53 was detected by RT-PCR.;Our data revealed that CSE strongly induced HepG2 cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner. CSE-induced cell death was considered to be apoptotic by observing the typical apoptotic morphological change by AO/EB staining and DNA fragmentation assay. The induction of HepG2 cell death was caused by an induction of apoptosis for the sub-G1 proportion increase, the downregulation of Bcl-2, the upregulation of Bax and p53, and the activation of the caspases-3 and -9 pathways.;These results clearly demonstrated that CSE was able to inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 cells and cause apoptosis.

Bacteria were visualized within sections of the OSCC by performing fluorescent in situ hybridization with the universal oligonucleotide probe, EUB338. DNA was extracted from each aseptically macerated tissue specimen using a commercial kit. This was then used as template for PCR with three sets of primers, targeting the 16S rRNA genes of Spirochaetes, Bacteroidetes and the domain Bacteria. PCR products were differentiated by TA cloning and bacterial species were identified by partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene fragments. A total of 70 distinct taxa was detected: 52 different phylotypes isolated from the tumorous tissues, and 37 taxa from within the non-tumorous specimens. Differences between the composition of the microbiotas within the tumorous and non-tumorous mucosae were apparent, possibly indicating selective growth of bacteria within carcinoma tissue. Most taxa isolated from within the tumour tissue represented saccharolytic and aciduric species.

Radiotherapy based on the tumor binding potential of the peptides and the radiotoxic effects of beta- or a-emitting radionuclides is an extension of such applications. Rhenium-188 (T1/2 16.9 hr, beta-max 2.1 MeV) coupled to the analogue RC-160 has been used to establish the feasibility of treating tumors with radiolabeled peptides, and our experience with this approach is summarized. In three different experimental tumor models (human prostate, mammary gland, and small cell lung carcinomas) in nude mice, treatment resulted in significant reduction or elimination of tumor burden. Two routes of administration were used: intra-lesional injection (prostate carcinoma) and intra-cavity injection (mammary and SCLC). Re-188-labeled negative control peptides bound to tumor cells to a low extent and did not exhibit therapeutic benefit. RC-160 by itself did not result in therapeutic benefit. Tumors which did not bind Re-188-RC-160 did not evidence a therapeutic benefit. Uncoupled Re-188 (control) was rapidly excreted via the urinary bladder and did not accumulate in either tumors or normal tissues even following direct injection. Instant radiolabeling kits containing 200 micrograms of RC-160 were labeled with < 3000 MBq of Re-188 in 30 minutes with no need for subsequent purification.

Recently, a monoclonal antibody (mab) against the progesterone receptor-complex became commercially available. The antibody Mi 60-10, developed by Milgrom and co-workers, is murine and principally directed against the progesterone receptor of the rabbit, but it also attacks an \"epitop\" of the human receptor. The Western-Blot analysis shows the antibody having several specific bands against T-47-D cells in the region of 110,000 dalton. To estimate the practical performance of this antibody, 73 primary breastcarcinomas were incubated with both the ER-ICA-Kit and the new \"mab\". The PAP method was used for visualisation. In a frozen section the mab Mi 60-10 proved as successful as the ER-ICA-Kit. However, in contrast to the ER-ICA-Kit, the mab Mi 60-10 is also successful in locating the receptor, also in formalin-fixed samples embedded in paraffin. This is also the case with blocks, which were stored for several years. In aspirated cytological samples the immunocytochemical demonstration of progesterone was just as successful as that of estrogen and comparable with results on the histological section. A satisfactory validity can be obtained today through the development of highly specific monoclonal antibodies against the progesterone receptor complex, with the complete receptor diagnosis of mammary carcinoma both immunocytochemically in frozen sections and additionally, of progesterone receptors in paraffin wax sections. The only current problems involve the exact quantification of the immunocytochemical results.

        "Doc_abstract":"The therapeutic options for patients with metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) have recently increased due to the development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), some of which have achieved remarkable clinical responses in MTC patients. However, the molecular basis for the large variability in TKI responses is unknown. In this exploratory study, we investigated the expression of eight key TKI target proteins (EGFR, KIT, MET, PDGFRB, VEGF (VEGFA), VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4)) by immunohistochemistry in 103 molecularly characterized MTC samples and identified the associated clinical and molecular features. A number of MTC samples exhibited a high expression of VEGFR2 and VEGFR3, which were overexpressed in 57 and 43% of the MTC samples respectively. VEGFR1, PDGFRB, VEGF, KIT, and MET were present in 34-20% of the cases, while EGFR was highly expressed in only 10% of the MTC samples. Some proteins exhibited large differences in expression between sporadic and familial cases, suggesting that different RET mutations may be associated with the immunohistochemical profiles. MTC samples with the C634 RET mutation exhibited a higher expression of VEGFR3 and KIT than the M918T RET-mutated and non-mutated RET tumor samples (P=0.005 and P=0.007 respectively) and a lower expression of VEGFR1 (P=0.04). Non-mutated RET MTC cases exhibited a lower expression of PDGFRB (P=0.04). Overall, this is the first study, to our knowledge, to show that multiple TKI targets are highly expressed in a subset of MTCs, suggesting that molecular stratification of patients may have the potential to improve TKI therapies for MTC.

The aim of this study is to examine expression patterns of stem-cell markers in hepatitis B virus-associated cirrhotic livers and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), and to investigate the stem-like cell capacity of tumorigenicity in these tissues.;Twenty surgically resected HCCs and corresponding adjacent tissues as well as 10 cirrhotic liver tissues were collected and immunohistochemical staining were performed to detect the expression of CD34, Thy-1, CD133, and c-kit. Then the non-cancerous tissues were transplanted into immunodeficient mice and the characteristics of the cells from primary tissue cultures were explored in vitro.;Immunohistochemical analysis characterized different expression patterns of stem-cell markers among these tissues. First, CD34 and Thy-1 expression was identified in proliferating bile ductules and it represented hepatic progenitor cells; CD133 and c-kit-positive cells were observed in the parenchyma of these tissues, and some of them were characterized as intermediate hepatocytes morphologically and spatially. Second, in two groups including three mice transplanted with tissues adjacent to HCC-initiated tumors, CD133 and c-kit expression was detected. Finally, our study also indicated that stem-like cells from tissue could express hepatic-lineage markers and possessed great capacities to proliferate, self-renew, and form clones in vitro.;Our results suggest that the stem-like cells in cirrhotic livers possess the capacity of tumorigenicity and may contain candidates for HCC cancer stem cells.",

Significantly higher values were obtained in HCC than liver cirrhosis. Sensitivity for diagnosis of HCC increased by serial and simultaneous determinations of ferritin and alpha-fetoprotein because high ferritin levels were observed more often in low alpha-fetoprotein-producing HCC and also in HBsAg negative, alcohol related, small-sized HCC.

The mayor problem in the field of CA 19-9 diagnostics is the lack of satisfying comparability between CA 19-9 test kits: external proficiency studies (8) indicate a discrepancy between enzymatic and isotopic tests regarding their correlation. The Cobas Core CA 19-9 EIA II contributes to the standardisation of the CA 19-9 kits and allows the switching over from CA 19-9 IRMA's to EIA's. The test can be performed on the random access immunochemistry analyzer Cobas Core with a total assay time of 75 minutes by using 20 microliters of serum or plasma specimens. The analytical sensitivity was determined to be > 0.3 IU/ml. The 2 recalibrators cover a measuring range from 0 to 400 IU/ml. A high-dose-hook effect was not observed up to a concentration of 400,000 IU/ml. Interferences from the sample caused by heterophilic antibodies are reduced to a minimum.

The proposed device was applied to quantify the immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) in cystic fibrosis (CF) newborn screening. A new ultrasonic procedure was used to extract the IRT from blood spot samples collected on filter papers. After extraction, the IRT reacted immunologically with anti-IRT monoclonal antibodies immobilized on a microfluidic glass chip modified with 3-aminopropyl functionalized silica nanoparticles (APSN-APTES-modified glass chips). The bounded IRT was quantified by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-IRT antibody (anti-IRT-Ab) using 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (ADHP) as enzymatic mediator. The HRP catalyzed the oxidation of nonfluorescent ADHP to highly fluorescent resorufin, which was measured by LIF detector, using excitation lambda at 561nm and emission at 585nm. The detection limits (LODs) calculated for LIF detection and for a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test kit were 0.87 and 4.2ngml(-1), respectively. The within- and between-assay variation coefficients for the LIF detection procedure were below 6.5%. The blood spot samples collected on filter papers were analyzed with the proposed method, and the results were compared with those of the reference ELISA method, demonstrating a potential usefulness for the clinical assessment of IRT during the early neonatal period.

Fifty two fresh samples of SCCHN were examined for p53 overexpression and 23 tumor-free tonsils served as controls. Using the monoclonal antibody Pab 1801 a refined ELISA technique was employed. In contrast to established ELISA procedures tumor tissue was pulverized at -80 degrees C prior to the actual ELISA (ELISA I). Comparative p53 detection was carried out by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and a commercially available ELISA kit (ELISA II). The modified ELISA I revealed p53 overexpression in 48 tumor samples (92%). p53 detection was obtained in 26 cases (50%) with ELISA II and with IHC 39 stained positive for p53 (75%). All of the controls were negative for p53 with ELISA and IHC. The p53 staining in IHC showed a significant correlation with the grading of the tumor. The ELISA results of the p53 overexpression did not show any correlation with tumor size or stage and rate of metastasis or other clinical parameters. This ELISA represents a more sensitive detection method of p53 than any other technique so far.

        "Doc_abstract":"Control of cell growth and differentiation occurs via extracellular signals known as growth factors. Growth factors are high affinity ligands for transmembrane receptors belonging to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). A number of genetic evidences have implicated RTKs in human diseases including developmental disorders and cancer. For instance, germline missense mutations involving the Ret receptor are found in patients affected by multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B (MEN2A and MEN2B) or familial medullary thyroid carcinomas. Somatic mutations in the Kit receptor are found in mastocytomas and in gastrointestinal tumors. Germline and sporadic mutations of the Met receptor have been described in kidney and hepatocellular carcinomas. Overexpression of the HER-2/neu receptor in breast cancer has been associated with tumor progression. The enzymatic activity of RTKs is strictly regulated and is usually inhibited under basal conditions. Receptor activation triggers a biochemical signalling cascade inside the cytoplasm, named signal transduction, which is subverted during the malignant transformation of cells. Signal transduction by RTKs is a multistep process which includes: (i) Ligand binding and receptor dimerization, (ii) receptor phosphorylation on tyrosine residues; (iii) recruitment to the receptor and activation of cytoplasmic signaling molecules that transmit signals to the nucleus. Each of the steps involved in this process can potentially be targeted to block the aberrant properties of tyrosine kinase receptors. By using the MET oncogene as a model this review focuses on the strategies that can be applied to therapeutically target RTKs.",

Using an ELISA kit, the circulating levels of VEGF and MMP-3 in the sera of 45 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and 45 healthy controls were assessed. Mean VEGF levels in the sera of patients with OSCC (122.4 ± 36.1) were significantly higher than those in controls (65.3 ± 23.4); however, no relation was found between VEGF levels and clinicopathologic factors. The serum MMP-3 level in OSCC patients was significantly higher (9.45 ± 4.6 ng/ml, n=45) than that in healthy controls (5.9 ± 3.6 ng/ml, n=45). There was no correlation in serum MMP-3 concentration with clinicopathologic features such as tumor stage, tumor size, nodal status, and histological grade. A significant relationship was found between serum levels of VEGF and MMP3.

The study included 67 patients with primary detection of carcinoma of H&N. The survival of these patients was evaluated in correlation with the disease stage and Cyfra 21-1 levels at initial diagnosis. 38 patients were followed clinically and with serial assays for at least 12 months, or until recurrence was diagnosed. Cyfra 21-1 levels were determined periodically, using an Elisa kit. Patients with Cyfra 21-1 < 1.5 ng ml(-1)had a higher survival rate compared to patients with Cyfra 21-1 > or = 1.5 ng ml(-1)(63% vs. 20%, respectively). The risk ratio of Ln(Cyfra 21-1) is 1.62 (P = 0.028). In a Cox regression model that included the disease stage and Ln(Cyfra 21-1), Ln(Cyfra 21-1) was preferred as the main parameter for predicting patients survival. In 83% of the 12 patients with recurrent or residual disease, Cyfra 21-1 was elevated before or during clinical detection of the recurrence. Cyfra 21-1 was found to be a prognostic marker for carcinoma of H&N, unrelated to the stage of the disease. Elevated levels of Cyfra 21-1 without clinical evidence of disease can be attributed to the marker's mean lead-time as compared to the clinical appearance of the disease.",

The apoptotic cells were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling method, using an Apop Tag in situ detection kit.;The immunoreactivity of survivin significantly increased in the transition from adenoma with low dysplasia to high dysplasia/carcinoma (P < 0.001). Similar changes in protein expression were observed for p53 but not for bcl-2, which was expressed throughout the colorectal tumorigenesis. This transition was associated with a significant decrease in the apoptotic index (AI) and significant increases in the Ki-67 labeling index (LI) and microvessel density (MVD; P < 0.001 for both). The expression of survivin inversely correlated with AI and was positively correlated with Ki-67 LI and MVD (P < 0.001 for both).;These results suggest that, like p53, survivin plays an important role in transition from adenoma with low dysplasia to high dysplasia during human colorectal tumorigenesis.",

We used a standardized quantitative immunocytochemical approach with 37 antibodies, based on high-throughput tissue microarrays and image analysis, and analyzed the results with respect to metastatic status after a mean follow-up of 86 months. Complete data were obtained for 586 patients. The predictive value of the markers was first analyzed individually by univariate analysis (log rank test) in 586 node-negative tumors, according to metastatic status during follow-up. Twenty-seven markers had significant prognostic value. ROC curve analysis (logistic regression) was then used to determine the marker combination that best classified the patients with and without metastases. A 15-marker signature (Bcl2, P16, P21, P27, P53, CD34, CA IX, c-kit, FGF-R1, P38, JAK, pSTAT3, CK9, STAT1 and ER) correctly classified 84.8% of the patients (sensitivity 85.5%, specificity 84.6%). When ER, PR and c-erb B2 were excluded from the analysis, a very similar signature, in which CK8-18 replaced ER, correctly classified 83.6% of the patients (sensitivity 84.5%, specificity 83.4%). These results show that quantitative immunoprofiling, independently of ER, PR and c-erb B2 status, can provide a basal-like signature, can properly predict the metastatic risk of node-negative breast carcinomas at diagnostic time. This may be helpful for selecting patients who do not need aggressive adjuvant chemotherapy, and for developing tailored therapies.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Combined modality therapy is gaining acceptance for treating stage 3 and 4A thymic tumors. Also, specific subsets of stage 2 tumors deserve particular attention. Single-center experiences demonstrate that there are some advantages in selected groups of patients. The overall relatively low complete response rate, however, imposes the search for better systemic therapy to optimize results. In fact, although thymic tumors are responsive to different cytotoxic regimens, none has been demonstrated to be the ideal one. New therapies and strategies should be designed and tested in large-scale multicenter prospective trials. Among the others, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors have shown some clinical response, because EGFR is overexpressed in thymoma. c-KIT is overexpressed in thymic carcinoma. Although in a recent study a clinical response to imatinib has been reported, results of a prospective study in patients who have thymic carcinoma are pending. Clinical responses have been reported also to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib. Other reports have stressed the presence of an up-regulation of COX-2 with a potential separate therapeutic pathway. Other markers, such as the expression of thymidine synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which predict sensitivity to 5-fluoruracil-based chemotherapy, were not correlated with the clinicopathological characteristics in a series of thymomas. These new therapies should be incorporated in a standardized approach that goes from a careful assessment of histology, staging, and lymph node status, and a constructive and nonempiric cooperation between the oncologist, radiotherapist, pathologist, and thoracic surgeon.",

The aspirates were suspended in a buffered saline solution, cytocentrifuged onto glass slides and immunocytochemically stained according to the protocol of commercial kits employing monoclonal antibodies specific for ER and PR. Immunocytochemical staining of malignant cells was evaluated on the basis of the percentage of stained cells; 10% staining was taken as the cutoff value. Fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) from 107 breast carcinomas were analyzed immunocytochemically for ER and 31 of them for PR, also. The overall concordance between ICA and DCC was 88% for ER and 87% for PR. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of ICA on FNAs as compared to conventional DCC were 87%, 90, 97% and 63%, respectively, for ER and 85%, 100%, 100% and 56% for PR. These findings suggest that estrogen immunocytochemical assays and progesterone immunocytochemical assays on FNAs in breast cancer patients are reliable techniques for evaluating receptor status and can be useful in assessing ER and PR whenever surgical biopsy is not indicated and when information about ER and PR status is required at the time of the clinical diagnosis.",

Previous reports have indicated that serum levels of soluble E-cadherin had prognostic value in these patients. The objective of the current study was to determine whether soluble E-cadherin levels could predict disease recurrence in patients with gastric carcinoma who underwent curative surgery.;Sixty-nine patients who underwent curative surgery for gastric carcinoma after December 1997 were followed prospectively. Venous blood samples were collected preoperatively, 1 month after surgery, and every 3 months thereafter. The blood samples were assayed for soluble E-cadherin and for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to define a cut-off level of E-cadherin for the optimal sensitivity and specificity for predicting disease recurrence.;The median follow-up was 21 months for patients with recurrent disease (n = 17 patients) and 36 months for patients without recurrent disease (n = 52 patients; P = 0.007). The optimal cut-off level of E-cadherin was 10,000 ng/mL. The sensitivity for predicting prediction disease recurrence using this cut-off level at 3 months and at 6 months postsurgery was 47% and 59% respectively, which was significantly better compared with the sensitivity of CEA using the conventional cut-off level (6% at 3 months postsurgery and 6% at 6 months postsurgery; P = 0.004 and P < 0.0001, respectively). The median time between the elevated E-cadherin level and documented disease recurrence was 13 months (range, 3-20 months), compared with 4 months (range, 1-20 months) for CEA.;Serum soluble E-cadherin was a good marker for predicting disease recurrence in the first 3-6 months after surgery, with a median of 13 months before clinical recurrence. The use of this marker may allow time for vigilant surveillance and consideration of adjuvant therapy.",

Increasing evidence also suggests that it has a significant role in the development of epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC). 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is one of the main indicators of oxidative stress and increased expression of 8-OHdG has previously been seen in EOC. DJ-1 is an oncoprotein connected to oxidative stress regulation, but its role in ovarian cancer is not well known. We investigated redox status in different histotypes of EOC by measuring serum 8-OHdG and DJ-1 concentrations and their associations with known prognostic factors.;Serum samples from newly diagnosed EOC patients were collected in 1996-2009 and stored at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Oulu University Hospital. Serum 8-OHdG and DJ-1 levels were measured by using commercially available ELISA kits. Clinical data was gathered retrospectively from the patients` files. Results were analyzed by using SPSS software.;In total, 112 patient samples were analyzed (38 serous, 20 mucinous, 34 endometrioid and 20 clear-cell). High serum 8-OHdG levels were associated with poor overall survival (OS) (p = 0.019), poor disease-free survival (DFS) (p = 0.020), platinum resistance (p = 0.002), serous histology versus other (p = 0.033), stage III-IV versus I-II (p = 0.009) and suboptimal surgical outcome (p = 0.012). Regarding histotypes, in the endometrioid EOC group in particular, serum 8-OHdG levels were significantly associated with poor DFS (p = 0.005), suboptimal surgical outcome (p = 0.025), and platinum resistance (p = 0.007). The prognostic significance of 8-OHdG in patients with endometrioid cancer in terms of DFS was confirmed in Cox regression analysis. High DJ-1 levels were associated with high histological grade (p = 0.029) and nonsignificantly associated with serous histology vs. other histology (p = 0.089).;An elevated serum 8-OHdG level is a significant predictor of poor prognosis, especially in cases of the endometrioid subtype of ovarian carcinoma. High 8-OHdG levels are associated with all traditional factors of poor prognosis in ovarian cancer and they also predict earlier development of platinum resistance.

In particular, the ability to distinguish poorly differentiated non-small-cell lung cancer from small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is at times difficult based upon morphology alone; available immunohistochemical markers such as neuroendocrine markers are of limited utility. We have demonstrated the role of p63 and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) in the differential diagnosis of poorly differentiated squamous-cell carcinoma (PDSCC) versus SCLC, mostly in biopsy samples (Wu et al., American Journal of Clinical Pathology 2003;119:696-702). Here, we examine further the utility of this panel in cytologic cell-block samples of lung cancers including both primary and metastatic cancers of pulmonary origin, and cases of nonpulmonary cancers metastatic to lung in which differential diagnoses included a lung primary.Four-micron thick sections of 30 alcohol-fixed paraffin-embedded cell blocks from 14 lung FNAs, 6 liver FNAs, 3 bronchial washings, 1 subcarinal lymph node FNA, 1 iliac lymph node FNA, 1 pelvic mass FNA, 1 neck lymph node FNA, 1 adrenal FNA, and 1 pleural effusion were deparaffinized and stained with monoclonal antibodies reactive to p63 (1:800, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and TTF-1 (1:50, Dako). Slides were stained for p63 using a streptavidin-biotin kit (BioGenex) and diaminobenzidine as chromagen, and counterstained with hematoxylin. Slides were stained for TTF-1 using a Dako Autostainer. Thirty cases were examined, including 8 primary SCLCs, 8 extra-pulmonary metastases of lung SCLCs, 4 PDSCCs and 4 primary pulmonary adenocarcinomas, and 6 nonpulmonary adenocarcinomas metastatic to lung or other sites. Fifteen out of 16 (94%) SCLC cases were p63-/TTF-1+, ranging in intensity from focal-weak to diffuse-strong; 1/16 SCLCs from a bronchial washing was p63-/TTF-1- but synaptophysin was positive. All 4 primary lung adenocarcinoma cases were p63-/TTF-1+; contrasting with nonpulmonary adenocarcinomas that were all p63-/TTF-1-. All 4 PDSCC cases were p63+/TTF-1-.

The DNase technic on paraffin sections allows excellent correlation between histologic characteristics and ER status and reduces DCC sampling error resulting from stromal dilution and tumor variability.

As a major potential source of tumor DNA in the aforementioned genotyping assays, it was necessary to conduct an analysis on both the quality and quantity of DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE). Therefore, four commercial FFPE DNA extraction kits were initially compared with respect to their ability to facilitate extraction of amplifiable DNA. The results showed that TrimGen kits showed the greatest performance in relation to the quality and quantity of extracted FFPE DNA solutions. Using DNA extracted by TrimGen kits as a template for tumor genotyping, a real-time wild-type blocking PCR (WTB-PCR) assay was subsequently developed to detect the aforementioned KRAS mutations in mCRC patients. The results showed that WTB-PCR facilitated the detection of mutated alleles at a ratio of 1:10,000 (i.e. 0.01%) wild-type alleles. When the assay was subsequently used to test 49 mCRC patients, the results showed that the mutation detection levels of the WTB-PCR assay (61.8%; 30/49) were significantly higher than that of traditional PCR (38.8%; 19/49). Following the use of the real-time WTB-PCR assay, the ΔCq method was used to quantitatively analyze the mutation levels associated with KRAS in each FFPE sample. The results showed that the mutant levels ranged from 53.74 to 0.12% in the patients analyzed. In conclusion, the current real-time WTB-PCR is a rapid, simple, and low-cost method that permits the detection of trace amounts of the mutated KRAS gene. ",

We herein report on biosafety, in vivo stability, biodistribution and dosimetry aspects of (111)In-CP04 in animal models, essential for the regulatory approval of the clinical trial.;Acute and extended single dose toxicity of CP04 was tested in rodents, while the in vivo stability of (111)In-CP04 was assessed by HPLC analysis of mouse blood samples. The biodistribution of (111)In-CP04 prepared from a freeze-dried kit was studied in SCID mice bearing double A431-CCK2R(±) xenografts at 1, 4 and 24h pi.

In this bitransgenic system, overexpression of the dnPPARγ-Flag fusion protein in myeloid-lineage cells abnormally elevated frequencies and total numbers of IL-7Rα(-)Lin(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(-), Lin(-)/Scal(+)/c-Kit(+), common myeloid, and granulocyte-monocyte progenitor populations in the BM. dnPPARγ overexpression led to up-regulation of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα in the blood plasma. As a result, CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) cells were systemically increased in association with activation of Stat3, NF-κB, Erk1/2, and p38 molecules. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) inhibited the proliferation and lymphokine production of wild-type CD4+ T cells in vitro. CD4+ T cells from doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice displayed reduced proliferation and lymphokine release. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations were decreased in doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice. Multiple forms of carcinoma and sarcoma in the lung, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes were observed in doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice. BM transplantation revealed that a myeloid-autonomous defect was responsible for MDSC expansion, immunosuppression, and tumorigenesis in these mice. These studies suggest that anti-inflammatory PPARγ in myeloid-lineage cells plays a key role in controlling pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis, MDSC expansion, immunosuppression, and the development of cancer.",

However, oncogene mutation patterns in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) have yet to be fully elucidated. To gain insight into mutation patterns in NPC, a high-throughput OncoCarta panel assay was used to determine 238 hotspot mutations across 19 common oncogenes in 8 NPC cell lines and 160 NPC patient samples from southern China. Statistical analyses were further conducted to identify associations between oncogene mutations and selected clinicopathological characteristics. In total, we identified 24 mutations across 11 oncogenes in 17 (10.6%) NPC patients. Four patients exhibited mutations in at least one oncogene. We also identified a PIK3CA H1047R mutant in 7 NPC cell lines. In addition, oncogene mutations showed no correlation with either risk habits (smoking and drinking) or other clinical characteristics except for TNM stage. KIT mutations were associated with poorer overall and relapse-free survival. Furthermore, KIT mutations together with age and N stage were independent prognostic factors in NPC. Taken together, the present study is the first report on mutations in multiple oncogenes in NPC. We found that hotspot oncogene mutations are infrequent in NPC patients from southern China. The lack of hotspot mutations requires a comprehensive characterization of gene mutations in NPC for developing new therapeutic targets in the future. ",

This paper characterizes the organ toxicity of sunitinib in Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys, and the reversibility of any treatment-induced effects. Rats and monkeys received sunitinib (0-15 and 0-20 mg/kg/day, respectively) orally on a consecutive daily dosing schedule for thirteen weeks or on an intermittent daily dosing schedule for up to nine months. Clinical observations and laboratory parameters were recorded. Necropsy was conducted following treatment/recovery periods, and histologic examinations were performed. In rats, sunitinib was generally tolerated at 0.3 and 1.5 mg/kg/day, and findings were reversible. In monkeys, the level at which there were no observed adverse effects was 1.5 mg/kg/day, and findings were similarly reversible (except for uterine/ovarian weight changes and skin pallor). Data suggest that inhibition of multiple RTK pathways may induce pharmacologic effects on organ systems in nonclinical species. Key pharmacologic effects of sunitinib included reversible inhibition of neovascularization into the epiphyseal growth plate, and impaired corpora lutea formation and uterine development during estrus. Similar observations have been noted with this class of RTK signaling inhibitors and are consistent with pharmacologic perturbations of physiologic/angiogenic processes associated with the intended molecular targets.",

The use of these agents requires early and appropriate management of side effects such as hematologic adverse events (HAE), in order to avoid unnecessary dose reductions and transitory or definitive treatment discontinuations. Beyond the increased infective risk, myelosuppression contributes to TKI-related fatigue, thus reducing both patients' quality of life and overall survival (OS). However, the frequency and severity of myelosuppression vary among sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib and axitinib, based on their different kinase selectivity. Their activity against fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3 or CD135) and c-kit, which are essential for survival and differentiation of hemopoietic progenitor cells, is critical to determine the hematologic toxicity profiles. This review describes the molecular mechanisms underlying the TKI effects exerted on hematopoiesis and immune response and related recent patents, of drugs already approved or still under evaluation in RCC, highlighting the potential impact of these effects on tumor response to treatment.",

Finally, immunohistochemical investigation revealing positivity for CK5/6, c-kit (CD117) and CD5 as well as negativity for thyroglobulin, calcitonin, vimentin and TTF-1 confirmed the diagnosis. Due to lymph node metastases, radiochemotherapy was performed. Fifteen months after the initial diagnosis disseminated pulmonary metastases were found and treated with cisplatin based chemotherapy, which led to a stabilisation of the disease. In June 2008, computed tomography showed progress of the pulmonary metastases, making further chemotherapeutical treatment necessary.

We have periodically monitored 14 cases of ovarian cancer (7 cases of serous cystadenocarcinoma, 4 cases of clear cell carcinoma, 1 case of endometrioid carcinoma and 1 case of metastatic ovarian cancer) using CA125, before and after surgery, during chemotherapy, and in follow-up. The serum CA125 was measured with a radioimmunoassay kit. As a result of this monitoring, we have discovered the following facts: The ten cases in which the titer of CA125 dropped to 35U/ml, which is cut off, by 60 days after surgery, when we had finished 2 courses of chemotherapy, showed good progress. In contrast to this, in the other cases, the degree of CA125 was still high 60 days after the surgery and did not drop after that. In these 4 cases, the tumor growth was found. It was therefore concluded that with this method a prognosis could be made much earlier than with the current system, and that relapse could be detected far earlier. We have also examined the mutual relations between CA125 and other tumor markers, IAP, TPA, HBDH, CEA, Ferritin, alpha 1AT, ESR, and LDH. Although we could see some usefulness in periodic monitoring with IAP, unlike CA125 it did not reflect the condition of a disease.

PCR microarray and real-time RT-PCR were designed to determine lncRNA expression in ECA-109 cells before and after treatment with β-elemene. Western blot was used to detect the hTERT level after the differentially expressed lncRNAs in ECA-109 cells were interfered with small interfering RNA (siRNA). On treatment with β-elemene, the proliferation of ECA-109 cells was notably inhibited, and about 85% of the lncRNAs showed higher expression levels in ECA-109 cells than in those untreated cells, from which, CDKN2B-AS1 was screened out. A specific siRNA (si-CDKN2B-AS1) that targets the β-elemene-mediated lncRNA CDKN2B-AS1 was designed, synthesized, and applied to treat ECA-109 cells.

Proteasome and calpain activity were determined using specific fluorogenic substrate. Proteasome subunits composition was measured by Western blot analysis.;In the present study, we revealed the connection between SCCHN lymphogenous metastasis development and NF-kB p50 expression. An increase in total, 26S and 20S proteasome activities and calpain activity was observed in cancer tissues in comparison with agreed standard (non-transformed tissue). The dynamics of changes in proteasome activity and proteasome subunits content during lymph nodes metastasis development had a complex pattern. Nonparametric analysis of variance showed the connection between the extent of metastatic affection of regional lymph nodes, total proteasome activity and LMP2 expression. Proteasome and calpain systems corresponded and interacted with each other. We also revealed a positive correlation between the NF-kB p65 and p50 expression and proteasome activity.;Taken together, our results suggest that above mentioned transcription factors and intracellular proteolytic systems are involved in SCCHN progression and metastasis.

These tumors, derived from Cajal cells or their precursors, most commonly occur at the age >50 years in the stomach (60%), jejunum and ileum (30%), duodenum (4-5%), rectum (4%), colon and appendix (1-2%), and esophagus (<1%), and rarely as apparent primary extragastrointestinal tumors in the vicinity of stomach or intestines. Their overall incidence has been estimated as 10 to 20 per million, including incidental minimal tumors. GISTs are rare in children (<1%) and almost exclusively occur in stomach. They are common in patients with neurofibromatosis 1, who have a predisposition to (multiple) small intestinal GISTs. GISTs contain a spectrum from minute indolent tumors to sarcomas at all sites of occurrence. Their gross patterns are diverse, including nodular, cystic, and diverticular tumors. External involvement of pancreas and liver can simulate primary tumor in these organs. In general, gastric tumors have a more favorable prognosis than the intestinal ones with similar parameters. Gastric GISTs < or =10 cm and < or =5 mitoses per 50 HPFs have a low risk for metastasis, whereas those with >5 per 50 HPFs and >5 cm in diameter have a high risk for metastasis. In contrast, all intestinal GISTs >5 cm independent of mitotic rate have at least moderate risk for metastases, and all >5 mitoses per 50 HPFs have a high risk for metastases. Intestinal GISTs < or =5 cm with < or =5 mitoses per 50 HPFs have a low risk for metastases. Gastric GISTs can be divided into histologic subgroups including 4 spindle cell and 4 epithelioid variants. Intestinal GISTs are a histologically more homogeneous group and often contain distinctive extracellular collagen globules, skeinoid fibers. Immunohistochemical demonstration of KIT, CD34, or protein kinase theta positivity helps to properly identify these tumors.",

Malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors are the third most common neoplasm among primary malignant small bowel tumors. A 56-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of appetite loss and dyspnea with movement. On admission, physical examination revealed severe anemia in her conjunctiva and a tumor in her left abdomen. Her hemoglobin level was 6.2 g/dL and other laboratory data were normal. Abdominal ultrasonograms and computed tomograms revealed a 55 x 70-mm heterogeneous mass and multiple low-density masses in the liver. Superior mesenteric arteriograms revealed a hypervascular tumor fed by the jejunal arteries. A malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor arising from the jejunum with liver metastases was suspected. Partial resection of the affected jejunum and left trisegmentectomy of the liver were performed. The resected primary tumor was 120 x 45 x 65 mm. The tumor was mainly submucosal, but extended outside the jejunum; it was elastically firm and multiloculated. A small ulcer was seen on the mucosal side. The metastatic liver tumors were solid or cystic with diameters of 20 to 40 mm. Histopathological examination revealed that the tumors were characterized by fascicular proliferation of spindle-shaped cells. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD34 and c-kit, and negative for S-100 protein and smooth muscle actin. This case was a malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor originating in the jejunum with liver metastases. The primary tumor and liver metastases were successfully resected simultaneously.",

During the first 2 years, more than 70% of laboratories did not test for some regional Italian mutations. Commercial kits for reverse dot-blot and oligonucleotide ligation assay PCR were used to detect mutations by 52.8% and 29.5%, respectively, of the participating laboratories. Reporting of results was still inadequate; in 2004 a model for the written report was introduced, but not all laboratories used it.;Our data show that few genotyping errors were made by laboratories and were principally due to misinterpretation and analytical reasons.

This was accompanied by increased levels of PGE2, but not those of leukotrienes. However, airway neutrophil influx and MIP-2 production remained similar in both mouse strains. The cPLA2alpha inhibitor arachidonyl trifluoro-methyl-ketone (ATK), but not aspirin which inhibit PGE2 synthesis, reduced LPS-induced airway constriction. LPS induced lower airway constriction and PGE2 production in cPLA2alpha -/- mice compared to corresponding littermates. Neither aspirin nor ATK interfered with LPS-induced airway neutrophil influx or MIP-2 production.;CF mice develop enhanced airway constriction through a cPLA2alpha-dependent mechanism.

The streak ovaries also contain small oocyte-free nodules with granulosa-like cells and often tumor-like structures. It has been hypothesized that these abnormal structures are of granulosa cell origin, and the aim of this study was to determine whether genes normally expressed in granulosa cells are also expressed in the nodules and tumor-like structures. The mRNAs encoding c-kit and its ligand stem cell factor (SCF), FSH receptor (FSH-R), follistatin, alpha-inhibin subunit, and the beta(A)- and beta(B)-activin/inhibin subunits were localized in ovaries of ewes with 0 (++), 1 (I+), or 2 (II) copies of the FecX(I) gene (n = 4-9 animals per genotype per gene) using in situ hybridization. Ontogeny of expression of all mRNAs examined was similar between ++ and I+ ewes. Expression of c-kit mRNA was observed in the oocyte of all follicular types present in ++, I+, and II ewes. Moreover, granulosa cells of type 2 (II) and type 2 and larger follicles (++, I+) expressed SCF mRNA. The mRNAs encoding FSH-R, follistatin, alpha-inhibin subunit, and beta(B)-activin/inhibin subunit were identified in type 3 and larger follicles of ++ and I+ ewes but not in follicles of II ewes that were only at the type 1, 1a, or 2 stages of development. However, the cells within the oocyte-free nodules of II ewes expressed all of these genes. The mRNAs encoding c-kit and beta(A)-activin/inhibin subunit were not observed in granulosa cells until antrum formation (type 5 follicles) or in the nodules of II ewes. Tumors from 4 ewes were obtained and classified as cystic, semisolid, or solid structures containing granulosa-like cells or as solid structures containing predominately fibroblast- and luteal-like cells. Often, two tumors were present on the same ovary. Tumors containing granulosa-like cells (n = 3-4 per gene) expressed the mRNAs encoding alpha-inhibin subunit, beta(A)-, and beta(B)-activin/inhibin subunits, follistatin, and the FSH-R but did not contain detectable amounts of mRNA for c-kit or SCF. Tumors composed predominately of fibroblast- and luteal-like cells expressed very low levels of SCF mRNA; of the other mRNAs examined, none were detected. Also, none of the genes examined were found to be expressed by the surface epithelium, theca externa, fibroblast, or vascular cells within the ovary of animals of any genotype. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the somatic cells in oocyte-free nodules and tumor-like tissue in II ewes originate from the granulosa cells of the small follicles.",

This study investigated the mechanisms of ISL-induced apoptosis in ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3 cells. Cell viability was evaluated using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. The apoptotic rate was determined via flow cytometry using an annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were assessed using a 2,7-dichlorofluorescein probe assay. Malondialdehyde (MDA) formation was determined via thiobarbituric acid reactive substance test. The expressions of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene (GADD153/CHOP), 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP 78), α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) phosphorylation, activating transcription factor 6α (ATF6α), and unspliced form of X-box binding protein1 (XBP1U) were analyzed via Western blot. Caspase-3 and caspase-12 activities were assessed using a fluorometric kit. Findings indicate that ISL significantly inhibits SKOV-3 cell proliferation, increases intracellular ROS levels, and causes SKOV-3 cell apoptosis. Moreover, ISL-exposed SKOV-3 cells trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as indicated by the enhancement of ER stress-related molecules p-eIF2α, GADD153/CHOP, GRP78, XBP1 expression, and cleavage of ATF6α. However, caspase-12 inhibitor (Z-ATAD) effectively and partially prevents ROS and MDA formation and inhibits ISL-induced SKOV-3 cell apoptosis.

        "Doc_abstract":"Angiogenesis inhibiting agents are currently integral component of anticancer therapy. However, tumors, initially responsive to anti-angiogenic drugs or vascular targeting agents, can acquire resistance. The limited clinical efficacy might result from the heterogeneous nature of tumors or alternatively from the unique phenotype of tumor vascular cells, widely diverse from so-called 'normal' endothelium. Hence, defining the molecular mechanisms driving this diversity might provide a rational basis to design combinatory therapies that should be more effective in avoiding resistance. Herein, we demonstrated that tumor-derived endothelial cells (TECs) isolated from breast and kidney carcinomas retained an endothelial phenotype, but outspread independently of growth factors. Applying small interfering RNA approach, we demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-3, but not vascular endothelial growth factor, released by TECs, supports their autocrine growth and promotes in vivo vessel formation and tumor angiogenesis. Meanwhile, we found that the expression of the membrane-bound kit ligand (mbKitL) depends on IL-3, and it is crucial for adhesion of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and inflammatory cells to TECs. These events required Akt activation. Finally, the finding that depletion of the mbKitL prevented EPC and inflammatory cell trafficking into vascular microenvironment, indicates that, as in bone marrow, the mbKitL can act as a membrane/adhesion molecule for c-Kit-expressing cells. These data provide evidences that an IL-3 autocrine loop can drive a tumor endothelial switch and that targeting IL-3 might confer a significant therapeutic advantage to hamper tumor angiogenesis.",

One hundred forty stage I-IIIA primary NSCLCs and 38 non-neoplastic lung samples were examined. IHC, using an FDA-approved Hercept monoclonal antibody kit, was performed and HER-2/neu gene alteration was assessed by FISH. The association of expression of HER-2/neu with clinicopathologic parameters was analyzed. Ninety-four percent of tumor samples (131/140) were fully interpretable after tissue processing. Twenty-five of them (19%) overexpressed (2+, 3+) HER-2/neu, while 106 (81%) had no or weak expression. All thirty-four interpretable non-neoplastic lung samples were negative for HER-2/neu alteration at protein and gene level. HER-2/neu protein overexpression correlated well with HER-2/neu gene amplification (r =.83, P < 0.001). HER-2/neu overexpression was significantly associated with histologic subtype: 19 adenocarcinomas (19/82, 23%) versus 4 squamous cell carcinomas (4/44, 9%) overexpressed Her-2/neu (P = 0.04). Statistical significance was observed between HER-2/neu expression and tumor differentiation, with strong positive (3+) expression observed more frequently in poorly differentiated tumors (P = 0.01). Patients with HER-2/neu abnormalities, particularly HER-2/neu gene amplification, exhibited a shorter survival (P = 0.043). The statistically significant difference (P < 0.005) between HER-2/neu alteration in tumor samples(25/131, 19%) and in the nonneoplastic tissue (0/34, 0%) implies that HER-2/neu may have a role in the carcinogenesis of NSCLC. The findings provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that the HER-2/neu receptor may represent a useful molecular target in the treatment of NSCLC. The significant association of HER-2/neu expression and gene amplification with poorly differentiated carcinoma compared with well differentiated carcinoma suggests that HER-2/neu may be involved in NSCLC tumor evolution. Patients with HER-2/neu gene amplification and strong positive expression of HER-2/neu protein showed a strong tendency toward shorter survival.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Hybrid oncocytic/chromophobe tumors (HOCT) of the kidney have been described in patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) and in association with renal oncocytosis without BHD. HOCT in patients without evidence of BHD or renal oncocytosis is exceedingly rare, and these cases have been poorly characterized. We have identified and studied 14 cases of HOCT from previously diagnosed renal oncocytomas (398 cases) and chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (351 cases) without evidence of BHD or renal oncocytosis. Immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and molecular genetic studies analyzing numerical chromosomal changes, loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 3p, and mutation status of VHL, c-kit, PDGFR, and folliculin (FLCN) genes were performed. HOCTs were identified in nine men and five women (age range 40-79 years). The size of tumors ranged from 2 to 11 cm. All tumors displayed a solid alveolar architecture and were composed of cells with abundant granular eosinophilic oncocytic cytoplasm with perinuclear halos. Occasional binucleated neoplastic cells were present, but irregular, hyperchromatic, wrinkled (raisinoid) nuclei were absent. The cytoplasm contained numerous mitochondria of varying sizes, but only sparse microvesicles with amorphic lamellar content were found. Tumors were positive for CK7 (12/14), AE1-AE3 (14/14), anti-mitochondrial antigen (14/14), E-cadherin (11/13), parvalbumin (12/14), and epithelial membrane antigen (14/14). Tumors were generally negative for racemase, CK20, CD10, and carboanhydrase IX. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed multiple chromosomal losses and gains with a median of four (range 1-9) chromosomal aberrations per case. Monosomy of chromosome 20 was common and found in 7 of 14 cases. Monosomy of chromosomes 6 and 9 was present in 4 of 14 cases each, of which two cases displayed monosomy for both chromosomes 6 and 9. Polysomy of chromosomes 10, 21, and 22 was found in 4/14 cases each, of which one case displayed polysomy for all these three chromosomes. No pathogenic mutations were found in the VHL, c-kit, PDGFR, and folliculin (FLCN) genes. (1) We have shown that hybrid oncocytic/chromophobe tumors of the kidney do occur, albeit rarely, outside the Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome and without associated renal oncocytosis. (2) These tumors constitute a relatively homogenous group with histomorphologic features of both chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma. (3) Sporadic hybrid oncocytic/chromophobe renal tumors are characterized by multiple numerical aberrations (both mono- and polysomies) of chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 9, 10, 13, 17, 21, and 22 and lack of mutations in the VHL, c-kit, PDGFRA, and FLCN genes. (4) The tumors seem to behave indolently as no evidence of malignant behavior was documented in our series, although admittedly, the follow-up was too short to fully elucidate the biological nature of this rare neoplasm. At worst, these tumors could have a low malignant potential, which only can be found out with longer follow-up.",

Messenger ribonucleic acid extracted from fresh frozen tissue specimens with bladder tumor and the control group were collected and subjected to RT-PCR to detect expression of the amplification bands of CK-19 and CK-20 (214 and 370 base pairs). In the mean time, Interleukin-6 was quantified in the sera of the patients using ELISA kit.;CK-19 and CK-20 RNAs were expressed in bladder cancer cases, but not expressed in the control group. They were significantly correlated to advanced tumor stage and grade, while CK-19 positivity, was also, correlated to tumor recurrence and tumor pathology being more in SCC than TCC. Moreover, IL-6 positivity was correlated to the occurrence of malignancy, advanced grade and pathology being more in SCC than TCC. ROC curve was utilized to choose the best cut-off for serum IL-6 (49.2 pg/mL). At the determined cut-off, the sensitivity was 66% and the specificity was 95%.

        "Doc_abstract":"Several commercially prepared DNA probes to human papillomavirus are available for nonisotopic in situ hybridization. Our laboratory conducted a comparison of eight commercially available DNA probes for diagnostic purposes. Six type-specific and two wide-spectrum probes from two vendors (Enzo and Digene Diagnostics) were used on routinely processed, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. An additional wide-spectrum probe from Dako was also investigated, but testing was discontinued early because performance was unsatisfactory. An automated apparatus was used for this comparison study, and the protocols for the kits were adapted accordingly. Twenty-four cases were studied; these included four cases of normal cervical tissue, six cases of condyloma, six cases of mild (low-grade) dysplasia with condyloma, five cases of moderate to severe (high-grade) dysplasia, and three cases of carcinoma. All of the low-grade dysplasias and the condyloma hybridized with at least one wide-spectrum and one type-specific probe. By contrast, only half of the high-grade dysplasias and carcinomas hybridized to any probe. The results of hybridizing with the type-specific probes were equivocal. Four cases reacted with two different type-specific probes. We conclude that nonisotopic in situ hybridization is a reproducible technique for detection of human papillomavirus, and recommend this method as an adjunct for routine histology in equivocal cases of condyloma. The technique adapts to a mechanized system, increasing its utility in the clinical setting. In our laboratory, the Enzo wide-spectrum probe was easier to interpret, generating a stronger signal with less nonspecific binding of chromogen. The sensitivities of the probes tested were not significantly different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The objective of this study was to determine if urine concentrations of the proangiogenic peptide, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), are high in dogs with bladder cancer compared with normal dogs and dogs with urinary tract infection. We used a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test kit to quantitate bFGF in the urine of 17 normal dogs, 10 dogs with urinary tract infection, and 7 dogs with locally active transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder. In normal dogs, the median urine bFGF concentration was 2.23 ng/g creatinine (quartile range, 1.53 to 5.12 ng/g creatinine). The median urine bFGF concentration in dogs with urinary tract infection did not differ significantly from normal dogs. Dogs with bladder cancer had significantly higher urine bFGF concentrations than normal dogs (P < .002) and dogs with infection (P < .02). The median urine bFGF concentration in dogs with transitional cell carcinoma was 9.86 ng/g creatinine (quartile range, 7.40 to 21.63 ng/g creatinine). Six of 7 dogs with bladder cancer had urine bFGF concentrations that were up to 7.4 times the 90th percentile value for normal dogs. Only 1 of 10 dogs with infection had a urine bFGF concentration that exceeded the 90th percentile of normal. These data suggest that canine bladder cancers export bFGF, and that urine bFGF may be useful as a diagnostic tumor marker or noninvasive indicator of treatment response.",

Cell proliferation was determined using a cell counting kit-8 assay, and commercial cell cycle and apoptosis analysis kits were used to determine the cell cycle by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of genes which mediate cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis was detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay was used to determine apoptosis rate. Western blot analysis was used to detect the protein expression levels of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway-associated proteins. The presented data show that cucurbitacin B significantly inhibited the proliferation of MKN-45 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In accordance with these findings, cucurbitacin B blocked the progression of the cell cycle from G0/G1 to S phase, which was confirmed by the mRNA expression analysis. Cucurbitacin B treatment significantly suppressed the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK2, while increasing the expression of p27. Cucurbitacin B also promoted cell apoptosis, as was determined by TUNEL assay and evaluation of mRNA expression. Further experiments suggested that the beneficial effect of cucurbitacin B on blocking the proliferation and inducing the apoptosis of MKN-45 cells may have been associated with suppression of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Thus, the present results indicate that cucurbitacin B suppresses proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MKN-45 cells, which may be mediated by inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Cucurbitacin B therefore may warrant further investigation as a feasible therapy for gastric carcinoma.",

Serum TRX levels were significantly correlated with the serum levels of ferritin and fibrogenesis markers, and with the histological stage of hepatic fibrosis. The serum TRX levels before interferon treatment of patients whose serum HCV-RNA was still positive on day 14 following interferon treatment (42.6 [20.1-90.0]) were significantly higher than those of patients whose serum HCV-RNA was negative on day 14 following interferon treatment (25.8 [7.4-59.8], p<0.05).;The serum TRX levels of patients with HCV infection increased with their serum ferritin levels and the progression of liver fibrosis. Patients with higher serum TRX levels exhibited resistance to interferon therapy.

They share some pluripotency stem-cell markers which may help to distinguish between seminoma, the most frequent TGCTs and non-seminoma tumours, such as embryonal carcinoma, teratocarcinoma or choriocarcinoma. Due probably to the propensity of seminoma to apoptosis, only two cell lines originated from pure testicular seminoma, TCam-2 and JKT-1 have been up to now, established, maintained and proposed as representative models of human testicular seminoma. However, both seem, following recent reports, to be able to drift. Thus, the molecular signature of embryonic stem-cell markers of the JKT-1 cells cultured in our laboratory, were studied by RT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence (IF). JKT-1 cells analysed after 30 passages, expressed placenta alkaline phosphatase but not alphafoetoprotein (alphaFP) nor beta-human chorionic gonadotropin. JKT-1 cells also expressed markers of pluripotency such as NANOG and OCT3/4 and more specific seminoma markers, such as AP2gamma and HIWI. However, protein expression of OCT3/4 and AP2y was weak and these JKT-1 cells expressed SOX2, a marker of embryonal carcinoma and did not express c-KIT usually expressed in most seminoma. Possible derivation through in vitro culture conditions was supported by looking at later passages (61) which showed a decrease of NANOG and HIWI protein expression. JKT-1 cells express a signature of markers which is still near from the one express by seminoma cells, allowing carcinogenetic studies. However, because of their great ability to drift as shown for TCam-2, it is recommended to verify and to precise this molecular signature before reporting functional results.",

Sunitinib is currently approved as a second-line treatment of mRCC in patients who have either not responded to or who are not eligible to receive interleukin-2. Clinical trials of sunitinib have found similar rates of partial response, disease stabilization, and progression-free survival. Sorafenib inhibits VEGF receptors, PDGF receptors, FLT3, RAF-1, and BRAF in vitro and has been shown to prevent the growth of tumors but not to reduce tumor size. Sorafenib has been proven to improve survival in a novel randomized discontinuation trial and a Phase III randomized, placebo-controlled trial. No studies have directly compared the effectiveness of sunitinib to sorafenib in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. Sunitinib and sorafenib share a similar mechanism of action and primarily target tumor angiogenesis by inhibiting a variety of tyrosine kinases; the agents have similar toxicity, with the exception of an increased risk of hypertension associated with the use of sorafenib. Sorafenib does not result in tumor shrinkage, but sunitinib significantly reduces tumor size.;The tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib offer improved outcomes for patients with mRCC, but they are far short of a cure. Despite the introduction of sorafenib and sunitinib, palliative care is still an acceptable treatment option for mRCC because of the disease's extremely poor prognosis.",

Using isoelectric focusing (IEF), endometrial ER was shown to be composed of four different species, with pI values of 6.1, 6.3, 6.6 and 6.8, indistinguishable from the isoforms found in normal rat uterus, and human breast and larynx carcinomas. The isoforms at pI 6.3, 6.6 and 6.8, all sedimenting at 4S by sucrose gradient fractionation, showed, on two-dimensional SDS electrophoresis, relative masses of 50, 70 and 65 kDa respectively, equal to the masses previously found in breast cancer. These isoforms did not alter their pI values during IEF fractionation performed in a linear gradient of urea, while the pI 6.1, sedimenting at 8S, generated a new isoform at about 9 mol/l urea with pI 7.2 and a relative mass of 65 kDa. The urea-dissociated isoform (pI 7.2) was able approximately to double the antibody binding with respect to the nondissociated oligomer, which suggested that some epitopes are 'masked', i.e. not accessible to the antibodies when ER is present in its complexed form. The evidence thus suggested that the oligomer at pI 6.1 contained a single 65 kDa ER form which, as a monomer, focused at pI 7.2. The variability in the ER isoform profile found in endometrial cancer was similar to the variability previously reported in breast and larynx carcinomas. The balance between these isoforms could be a dynamic parameter involved in the functionality of this receptor and consequently in cell transformation.",

This study aimed to elucidate the mutational events in Malaysian patients with high grade serous ovarian cancer by performing targeted sequencing on 50 cancer hotspot genes.;Nine high grade serous ovarian carcinoma samples and ten normal ovarian tissues were obtained from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Center (UKMMC) and the Kajang Hospital. The Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 targeting \"mutation-hotspot region\" in 50 most common cancer-associated genes was utilized. A total of 20 variants were identified in 12 genes. Eleven (55%) were silent alterations and nine (45%) were missense mutations. Six of the nine missense mutations were predicted to be deleterious while the other three have low or neutral protein impact. Eight genes were altered in both the tumor and normal groups (APC, EGFR, FGFR3, KDR, MET, PDGFRA, RET and SMO) while four genes (TP53, PIK3CA, STK11 and KIT) were exclusively altered in the tumor group. TP53 alterations were present in all the tumors but not in the normal group. Six deleterious mutations in TP53 (p.R175H, p.H193R, p.Y220C, p.Y163C, p.R282G and p.Y234H) were identified in eight serous ovarian carcinoma samples and none in the normal group.;TP53 remains as the most frequently altered gene in high grade serous ovarian cancer and Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) in combination with Ion Ampliseq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 were proven to be instrumental in identifying a wide range of genetic alterations simultaneously from a minute amount of DNA.

For 15 patients, an additional plasma sample was obtained during an exacerbation. Soluble CD14 (sCD14) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were quantified using ELISA kits. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin(IL)-6, IL-1β, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) were quantified using Luminex™ immunoassays. Stable state biomarker levels were examined in their ability to predict individuals that would experience a pulmonary exacerbation requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics within 4 months. Paired stable and exacerbation plasma biomarker levels were also compared.;sCD14 levels were significantly higher in patients that experienced a pulmonary exacerbation requiring IV antibiotics within 4 months (p = 0.001). sCD14 cut-off value of 1450 ng/mL was associated with an area under the curve of 0.91 (95% CI 0.83-0.99) for predicting an exacerbation within 4 months of a stable visit, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 82%.

The objective of this study was to provide some sequence data and phylogeny of EG isolates recovered from the Sudanese one-humped camel (Camelus dromedaries). Fifty samples of hydatid cysts were collected from the one- humped camels (Camelus dromedaries) at Taboul slaughter house, central Sudan. DNAs were extracted from protoscolices and/or associated germinal layers of hydatid cysts using a commercial kit. The mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (NADH1) gene and the cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene were used as targets for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The PCR products were purified and partial sequences were generated. Sequences were further examined by sequence analysis and subsequent phylogeny to compare these sequences to those from known strains of EG circulating globally.;The identity of the PCR products were confirmed as NADH1 and cox1 nucleotide sequences using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) of NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD). The phylogenetic analysis showed that 98% (n = 49) of the isolates clustered with Echinococcus canadensis genotype 6 (G6), whereas only one isolate (2%) clustered with Echinococcus ortleppi (G5).;This investigation expands on the existing sequence data generated from EG isolates recovered from camel in the Sudan.

Intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) content and protein kinase A (PKA) activity were determined with ELISA kit and the non-radioactive PepTag test, respectively.;LGP at 800μg/ml elicited a sustained increase in Cl(-) secretory response, which was inhibited by CFTR(inh)172, a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) inhibitor.

IRT exists as 2 isoforms: IRT1 and IRT2, with IRT2 being more closely aligned with pancreatic disease, including CF. Assay standardization between programs is a continuing problem because the IRT assays currently in use variously recognize either 1 or both isoforms. Here we report the development of a multiplexed assay for both forms of IRT simultaneously.;Using 2 different Luminex bead sets, we developed assays for each IRT isoform separately and then combined them. Using the sum of IRT1 and IRT2 values (IRT1+IRT2), we compared the results with a CF kit currently in use.;In a sample set consisting of 16 cases confirmed positive for CF, we established a cutoff at >97 microg/L total IRT. Seven of 8 carriers with 1 CF mutation screen-positive by the standard method were also screen-positive by IRT1+IRT2. Of 32 cases screen-positive by standard IRT, 11 were screen-negative by IRT1+IRT2. None of these 11 cases had CF mutations identified by the screening program.;These data indicate that the multiplex method with specificity for 2 isoforms of IRT has performance comparable to that of a standard IRT method and the advantage of improved standardization by detection of the 2 isoforms.",

Elevated CEA levels were noted in those who had infiltration of cancer cells extending through the proper muscle layer. In 79.2% of curative resections CEA levels returned to normal within one month, but the titers remained elevated in 73.3% of palliative resections. Among 26 patients with recurrent disease, 16 had a hepatic metastasis showing a previous or simultaneous CEA rise, whereas 10 had a local recurrence with a slow rise or normal. In addition, a quantitative study of CEA in extracts of 87 tumors was made in order to examine the factors affecting the level of circulating CEA. There was no significant difference between the CEA contents of the tumor and its level of circulating CEA. The level of circulating CEA might be influenced by the spread cancer cells, rather than the tumor contained CEA.",

Total RNA was then hybridized onto a GeneChip, according to the standard protocols provided by the manufacturers of the GeneChip IVT Express Kit. The resulting fluorescence signals were analyzed and displayed using the Cluster and Treeview software programs. Under the criteria for significant differential expression (≥2-fold difference), 610 up- and 1135 down-regulated genes were identified in tumor sphere cells, compared to HCG-27 cells. These genes were involved in cell growth, signal transduction, tumorigenesis, and many other functional aspects of tumor cells. In conclusion, a number of genes were differentially expressed in tumor sphere cells compared to HCG-27 cells.

Triplicate analysis revealed that 22 genes changed their expression levels in the periphery relative to the central region: 15 upregulated and seven downregulated (arbitrary threshold of 1.5-fold or greater). Differences in RNA levels were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR for two of the genes and by changes in protein levels, detected by immunohistochemistry, for a couple of representative gene products.

Many methods to detect glycogen already exist but only a few are quantitative. We describe here a method using the Abcam Glycogen assay kit, which is based on specific degradation of glycogen to glucose by glucoamylase. Glucose is then specifically oxidized to a product that reacts with the OxiRed probe to produce fluorescence. Titration is accurate, sensitive and can be achieved on cell extracts or tissue sections. However, in contrast to other techniques, it does not give information about the distribution of glycogen in the cell. As an example of this technique, we describe here the titration of glycogen in two cell lines, Chinese hamster lung fibroblast CCL39 and human colon carcinoma LS174, incubated in normoxia (21% O2) versus hypoxia (1% O2). We hypothesized that hypoxia is a signal that prepares cells to synthesize and store glycogen in order to survive(1). ",

Finally, the expression levels of cell proliferation and apoptosis related proteins such as p21, Bcl-2 and Bax were determined by western blotting. SIRT3 siRNA effectively down-regulated the expression of SIRT3 protein in EC9706 cells, and the reduced expression of SIRT3 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Most notably, the SIRT3 depletion markedly increased the expressions of p21 and Bax proteins but reduced Bcl-2 protein expression.

The histogenesis of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma has remained unclear for many years. However, recent advances in hepatic progenitor cell (HPC) investigations have provided new insights. The concept that combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma originates from HPCs is adopted in the chapter \"combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma\" of the latest World Health Organization (WHO) classification. In this study, we conducted clinicopathologic analysis of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma according to the latest WHO classification. Fifty-four cases were included in this study. Pathologic diagnosis was made according to the WHO classification. When a tumor contained plural histologic patterns, predominant histologic pattern (≥50%) was defined. Minor histologic patterns were also appended. Immunohistochemical staining with biliary markers (CK7, CK19, and EMA), hepatocyte paraffin (HepPar)-1, HPC markers (CD56, c-kit, CD133, and EpCAM), and vimentin was performed. Forty-five and 50 patients were analyzed for progression-free survival and overall survival, respectively. Ten, 1, 32, and 11 cases were diagnosed as: combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, classical type; combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, stem cell features, typical subtype; combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, stem cell features, intermediate cell subtype; and combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, stem cell features, cholangiolocellular type, respectively. Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinomas usually have high expression of biliary markers. CD56, c-kit, and EpCAM were expressed to various degrees in all combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinomas apart from the hepatocellular carcinoma component of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, classical type. The expression of CD133 and vimentin was observed only in combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, stem cell features of intermediate cell subtype and cholangiolocellular subtype. The expression of CD133, EpCAM, and vimentin was significantly high in combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, subtypes with stem cell features, especially cholangiolocellular subtype. Minor histologic patterns were significantly frequent in combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, subtypes with stem cell features, compared with combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma, classical type. There was no significant difference in clinical outcome between each subtype. Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma has wide histologic diversity and shows immunophenotypic expression of not only biliary markers but also HPC markers to various degrees, suggesting that the histogenesis of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma could be strongly associated with HPCs. Our results pathologically validate the latest WHO classification of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma. However, the complex mixture of histologic subtypes has presented a challenge to the classification of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma. Further study should be conducted using a large cohort to support this classification.",

The special urine examination method detects genetic alterations of the urothelial cells found in the urine, using fluorescent directlabeled DNA probes binding to the peri-centromeric regions of chromosomes 3, 7 and 17 as well as on the 9p21 locus. We aimed to evaluate the utility of UroVysion test in the light of the histological diagnosis. Urine samples from 43 bladder cancer patients and 12 patients with no or benign alterations were studied using a new application of FISH technique: the UroVysion reagent kit. The obtained FISH results were compared with the histological findings of the transurethral surgical resection specimens. The study rated the specificity and sensitivity of the technique 100% and 87%, respectively. Therefore, the technique could well fit into the diagnostic process of bladder carcinomas. Statistical analyses showed significant correlation between tumor progression and the severity of the genetic alterations detected by this FISH technique. Furthermore, positive correlation was found between tumor grade and the proportion of tumor cells showing genetic abnormality. The noninvasiveness, the robustness of evaluation and the high specificity/sensitivity are all in favor of this technique.

Sorafenib markedly decreased 2-week survival relative to vehicle-treated controls, but echocardiography at 1 and 2 weeks post MI detected no differences in cardiac function. Sorafenib-treated hearts had significantly smaller diastolic and systolic volumes and reduced heart weights. High doses of sorafenib induced necrotic death of isolated myocytes in vitro, but lower doses did not induce myocyte death or affect inotropy. Histological analysis documented increased myocyte cross-sectional area despite smaller heart sizes after sorafenib treatment, further suggesting myocyte loss. Sorafenib caused apoptotic cell death of cardiac- and bone-derived c-kit+ stem cells in vitro and decreased the number of BrdU+ (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine+) myocytes detected at the infarct border zone in fixed tissues.

When sorafenib-treated animals received metoprolol treatment post MI, the sorafenib-induced increase in post-MI mortality was eliminated, cardiac function was improved, and myocyte loss was ameliorated.;Sorafenib cardiotoxicity results from myocyte necrosis rather than from any direct effect on myocyte function. Surviving myocytes undergo pathological hypertrophy. Inhibition of c-kit+ stem cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis exacerbates damage by decreasing endogenous cardiac repair. In the setting of MI, which also causes large-scale cell loss, sorafenib cardiotoxicity dramatically increases mortality.",

In the present study, immunohistochemical methods were used to evaluate the expression of these markers in a series of male gonads from fetuses from the second and third trimesters, and neonates. In addition to these markers, the presence of VASA (a protein specific for the germ cell lineage), TSPY (the testis-specific protein, Y-encoded), and the proliferation index (Ki-67 antigen) was analysed. All these proteins are reported to be present both during spermatogenesis and in CIS/ITGCNU. Positive staining for VASA with varying intensity was found in all germ cells, while TSPY was predominantly located in the prespermatogonial cells at all developmental ages. In contrast, the markers PLAP, c-KIT, OCT3/4, and Ki-67 were more frequent at earlier developmental stages and decreased gradually with time, although they could occasionally be detected in germ cells of neonates. These findings are in line with a declining number of gonocytes during fetal development, concomitant with an increase in the number of prespermatogonia. The latter have lost the immature germ cell phenotype. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that CIS/ITGCNU arises from developmentally arrested germ cells, most likely primordial germ cells/gonocytes, at an early time point during intrauterine development.",

Uncontrolled activity of SCF/c-kit signaling pathway contributes to the formation of a variety of human malignancies. In this study, we determined whether SCF expression could risk-stratify patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resection. HCC tissues from 160 patients were collected during curative resection and stained with SCF and CD34, a marker for microvessel density (MVD), using immunohistochemistry. Two statistical analyses were performed: an independent continuous and a multivariate categorical analysis, with test/validation set-defined cut points, and Kaplan-Meier estimated outcome measures of overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). We found that higher levels of SCF confer worse OS (continuous P = 0.014; and categorical P = 0.009), and RFS (continuous P = 0.002; categorical P = 0.003) of patients with HCC. SCF varies independently from MVD-CD34, tumor node metastasis, histologic grade, age and gender, and retains prognostic significance when analysed as a categorical variable in a multivariate analysis . We confirmed that MVD-CD34 is also an independent prognostic marker for patients with HCC. The levels of SCF and CD34 showed a positive and significant correlation (P < 0.0001) and double low expression confers superior OS (median = 48 months) and RFS (median = 24 months), whereas double high expression confers shortest RFS (median = 10.5 months) compared with single measurements. The prognostic values of SCF and CD34 were independently determined in this study and we propose that both of them are independent prognostic markers for HCC. ",

Patients with LC and HCC showed significantly increased Fuc-Hpt levels in comparison to CH patients or healthy volunteers. Fuc-Hpt levels tended to be higher in HCC patients than in LC patients. Fuc-Hpt was better than α-fetoprotein (AFP) and AFP-L3 for predicting HCC [diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound] in LC patients with long-term follow-up. More than 80% of LC patients with long-term follow-up showed increased Fuc-Hpt during hepatocarcinogenesis, and 38% of early-stage HCC patients with short-term follow-up showed a gradual increase in Fuc-Hpt before imaging diagnosis.;These results suggest that Fuc-Hpt is a novel and potentially useful biomarker for predicting liver disease progression and HCC development.",

Patients with MRCC received 12-week cycles of interferon [3 million units (MU) subcutaneously thrice in week 1 and 6 MU thrice weekly thereafter] and either gefitinib (500 mg daily) or imatinib (600 mg daily). The gefitinib/imatinib dose was reduced as needed owing to toxicity. The primary endpoint was objective tumor response. Secondary endpoints were time to tumor progression, overall survival, and safety. Seventeen patients were enrolled. Most had clear cell [36% (6/17)] or papillary [36% (6/17)] tumors. Most (n=14) were treated on the gefitinib arm, including two patients who crossed over from the imatinib arm after experiencing disease progression. Objective tumor responses were evaluable in 14 patients (82%). Of these 14, partial responses occurred in three (21%), stable disease in seven (50%), and progressive disease in four (29%). The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were skin rash, flu-like symptoms, and fatigue (both treatment arms); diarrhea (gefitinib arm only); and thrombocytopenia and leukopenia (imatinib arm only). Median time to tumor progression (range) for patients on the gefitinib arm only was 4.27 (1.13-15.97) months and median overall survival (range) was 11.42+ (1.13-29.07+) months.

Other noninvasive diagnostic methods have not yet given satisfactory results. There is a need for a reliable yet noninvasive method for the detection of bladder cancer. Our aim was to investigate whether cell-free DNA quantified in urine (ucf-DNA) could be a useful marker for the diagnosis of bladder cancer. A standard urine test was performed in 150 naturally voided morning urine samples that were processed to obtain a quantitative evaluation of ucf-DNA. Leukocyturia and/or bacteriuria were found in 18 subjects, who were excluded from the study. Statistical analysis was performed on 45 bladder cancer patients and 87 healthy subjects. Ucf-DNA was extracted from urine samples by a spin column-based method and quantified using four different methods: GeneQuant Pro (Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburg, PA, USA), Quant-iT DNA high-sensitivity assay kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), Real-Time PCR (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and NanoDrop 1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Houston, TX, USA). Median free DNA quantification did not differ statistically between bladder cancer patients and healthy subjects. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was developed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of ucf-DNA quantification for each method. The area under the ROC curve was 0.578 for GeneQuant Pro, 0.573 for the Quant-iT DNA high-sensitivity assay kit, 0.507 for Real-Time PCR, and 0.551 for NanoDrop 1000, which indicated that ucf-DNA quantification by these methods is not able to discriminate between the presence and absence of bladder cancer. No association was found between ucf-DNA quantification and tumor size or tumor focality. In conclusion, ucf-DNA isolated by a spin column-based method and quantified by GeneQuant Pro, Quant-iT DNA high-sensitivity assay kit, Real-Time PCR or NanoDrop 1000 does not seem to be a reliable marker for the diagnosis of bladder cancer.",

However, few studies have been published previously associated with the roles of ATO and B7‑H4 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti‑invasive role of ATO in HCC, to determine the effect of ATO treatment on the expression of B7‑H4 and to further assess the possible underlying mechanisms. Following treatment of the cells with 2, 4 and 8 µM ATO for 48 h, cell counting kit‑8 (CCK‑8), Transwell and western blot assays were used to determine the extent of human MHCC97‑H HCC cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and B7‑H4 expression, respectively. The results revealed that 1 µM ATO markedly decreased cellular proliferation, and ATO administered at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 µM markedly inhibited the migration and invasion of the human MHCC97‑H HCC cell line. The expression of B7‑H4 in the treatment groups was markedly reduced. Signal transduction mediated via the Janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 pathway was inhibited upon treatment with 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 µM ATO. Additionally, the protein expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and vascular endothelial growth factor were markedly reduced in HCC cells upon treatment with ATO. In conclusion, ATO may reduce the protein expression levels of B7‑H4 in MHCC97‑H HCC cells, and further affected HCC tumorigenesis and progression. ATO may be a putative agent for the development of therapeutic strategies against human liver cancer.",

The relationship between specific genotypes of high-risk HPV and some human cancers is well established. The aim of this work was to detect the HPV genotypes present in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).;We evaluated 71 samples of patients with histopathological diagnosis of HNSCC. The DNA extraction was conducted with the QIAGEN commercial kit. HPV detection and genotyping were performed by reverse hybridisation (INNO-LiPA) following the commercial specifications.;The mean age of the patients evaluated was 60.7 ± 13.11 years. The distribution of the lesions included 25 (35.20%) cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity, 23 (32.39%) of larynx, 16 (22.50%) of the oropharynx, 4 (5.63%) of paranasal sinus, and 2 (2. 80%) cases of SCC of the nostril. Of the patients, 78.9% were males, and of these 76% were tobacco users and 67.6% were alcohol consumers. The viral DNA was detected in 67.6% of the samples. The oral cavity and the larynx were the highest HPV-positivity sites with 35.40% and 29.10% respectively. The most frequent genotype was 16 as single infection (18.70%), or in combination with another HPV types. In the oral cavity and larynx the genotypes 16 or the combination 6 and 51 were present in 11.76% and 14.28%, respectively; and in the oropharynx the most frequent genotype was 16 in 22.50% of the cases, and in the paranasal sinus 50% presented infection with HPV-6. We observed that tumours with most advanced size and stage presented greater HPV positivity.;This study shows a high percentage of HPV positivity in SCC is mainly associated with high-risk HPV. It is important to highlight that viral infection, especially HPV-16, could be a risk factor in HNSCC progression.",

Among these, the microplate adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-based tumor chemosensitivity assay (ATP-TCA) has gained particular merits for ex vivo chemosensitivity testing of native nonhematological tumors including cancers of the breast, ovary, gastrointestinal tract, cervix and corpus uteri, and lung; malignant melanomas; gliomas; sarcomas; and mesotheliomas. For this indication, the ATP-TCA can now be considered the best documented and validated technology. This assay, which is now commercially available, provides a highly reproducible, easy-to-handle kit technique; low technical failure rates; and a high methodological efficacy requiring only 1 x 106 tumor cells to test four to six different drugs or combinations. In ovarian and breast carcinomas, the predictive accuracy is > 90%, with a positive predictive value of 85-90% and a negative predictive value near 100%, respectively. In primary ovarian cancers, the ATP-TCA has been found to accurately predict both clinical response and survival. In two prospective clinical trials in patients with heavily pretreated ovarian cancer, chemotherapy individually selected by the ATP-TCA has been found to triple the response rates and nearly double the survival compared to empirically chosen regimens. Consequently, this assay, which is now under phase III evaluation, has successfully been used in new agent development to screen for novel chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of patients with breast and ovarian carcinoma and melanoma, respectively. This chapter highlights the recent preclinical and clinical experience with this promising technology and gives a detailed description of all the technical aspects of the ATP-TCA.",

In addition, hormonal receptor status (ER and PR) and HER-2 protein overexpression by IHC were also studied, and results were compared with whole tissue sections. FISH for HER-2 was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from 114 invasive breast carcinomas both on whole tissue sections and on TMAs containing the same tumors. The TMA was created using 0.6-mm tissue cores with four sampled cores per tumor from the same tissue block used for whole section FISH. The PathVysion HER-2 probe kit was used for the FISH analysis. A ratio of HER-2:Chromosome17 > or =2.0 was interpreted as positive for gene amplification. The ER or PR was interpreted as positive when nuclear staining was detected in more than 10% of tumor cells. The HER-2 IHC (HercepTest; DAKO Corp, Carpinteria, CA) results were interpreted as 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+ according to standard criteria. The FISH results in the TMA and whole sections were concordant in 99 out of 101 successfully analyzed cases (99%).

Cytokines, low-molecular-weight proteins with a broad range of activity, have been shown to be involved in the regulation of hepatocyte functions, as well as in the pathogenesis leading to liver damage. In the present study, we investigated the correlation between serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in altogether 75 patients chronically infected with HBV. They comprised 15 asymptomatic carriers, 15 chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) and 15 chronic active hepatitis (CAH) patients, 15 cases of cirrhosis and 15 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) previously diagnosed by serology and histology, respectively. IL-6 and IFN-gamma levels in their sera were determined using a commercially available kit. Our results showed various concentrations of serum IL-6 detectable in 6.7% of asymptomatic carriers, 13.3% of patients with CPH, 20% of patients with CAH, 33.3% in cirrhotic patients and 66.7% in HCC. In contrast, serum IFN-gamma was only found in 13.3% of asymptomatic carriers and CAH, but could not be detected in the other groups. Our data demonstrated a positive correlation between serum IL-6 and clinical severity of chronic HBV infection, whereas the IFN-gamma levels appeared not to be correlated. From this we conclude that among chronic hepatitis patients IFN-gamma is mostly not expressed at a level detectable by serology, whereas according to other authors it is involved in the immediate immune response triggered by acute hepatitis. IL-6 on the other hand, might rather be responsible for liver inflammation and regeneration in chronic liver disease.",

In addition to its classic morphologic features, focal clear cells were also identified within the tumor, thereby expanding the morphologic spectrum of the neoplasm at this location. A comprehensive immunohistochemical characterization of the tumor was performed, as was microsatellite instability testing. The tumor was diagnosed in a 79-year-old woman and was surgically/pathologically staged as IB by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) criteria. The tumor displayed typical morphologic features (tumor cells with a syncytial appearance in an inflammatory background) with the exception of the aforementioned polygonal cells with well-defined cell membranes and cytoplasmic clarity in <1% of the tumor. The epithelial component showed strong and diffuse immunoreactivity for CAM 5.2, p53, p16, E-cadherin, cytokeratin (CK) 7, vimentin, CKAE1/3, and epithelial membrane antigen. The MIB-1 proliferative index in these regions was about 70%. Approximately 10% to 30% of lesional cells showed strong immunoreactivity for CK903, S100, MOC31, CD138, but the pattern of positivity was patchy and discontinuous. The epithelial cells were entirely negative for CK5/6, smooth muscle actin, p504S, CK20, synaptophysin, chromogranin, CD56, CD99, WT-1, thyroid transcription factor-1, p63, CD117 (c-kit), CD34, calretinin, desmin, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, FLI-1, ALK-1, D2-40, cytomegalovirus antigen, Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA-1, Epstein-Barr virus, monoclonal carcinoembryonic antigen, and HER2/neu. The foci with clear cells were not immunophenotypically distinct from the non-clear cell areas and had an approximately similar proliferative index. The inflammatory component was mixed (lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils) but was composed predominantly of CD45/CD3/CD8 T lymphocytes, with a CD3 to CD20 ratio of approximately 10:1 and CD8 to CD4 T-cell ratio of approximately 3:1. Numerous (>100 positive cells per 10 high-power fields) S100-positive tumor-infiltrating Langerhans cells were present. The tumor DNA did not exhibit microsatellite instability at any of the loci analyzed. In summary, the limited data available suggest that lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma is a distinct histotype of endometrial carcinoma that is typically seen in postmenopausal women, seems to be unrelated to the Epstein-Barr virus, and has an uncertain prognosis. Differential diagnostic and pathogenetic considerations are discussed within the context of the lesional morphologic and immunophenotypic profile as described herein and in previously reported cases.

Of the fungal pathogens, the Aspergillus fumigatus has been a major cause of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) which has five main stages--the acute, remission, exacerbation, glucocorticoid dependent and fibrotic stage. The diagnosis of ABPA remains difficult due to its overlapping clinical and radiological features with tuberculosis and cystic fibrosis. From past few decades, the crude fractions of A. fumigatus have been used for immunodiagnosis of ABPA. Most of the detection kits based on crude fractions of A. fumigatus are quite sensitive but have low specificity. Till date 21 known and 25 predicted allergens of A. fumigatus have been identified. Of these allergens, only five recombinants (rAsp f1-f4 and f6) are commercially used for diagnosis of allergic aspergillosis. Remaining allergens of A. fumigatus have been restricted for use in specific diagnosis of ABPA, due to sharing of common antigenic epitopes with other allergens. Complete sequencing of A. fumigatus genome identified 9926 genes and the reports on the proteome of A. fumigatus have shown the presence of large number of their corresponding proteins in the pathogen. The analysis of immunoproteomes developed from crude fractions of A. fumigatus by IgG/IgE reactivity with ABPA patients and animal sera have identified the panel of new antigens.

Auxological parameters, pulmonary function and the Shwachman-Kulczycki (S-K) score were assessed, and serum samples were drawn at baseline and after 12 months.;TNF-alpha, IL-6, IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3 and insulin were assayed using specific commercial kits.;At baseline, TNF-alpha serum concentration was related to serum IGF-I concentration (R = 0.53), IGF-II bioactivity (IGF-II/IGFBP-3 molar ratio, R = +0.52) and insulin concentration (R = +0.63). Changes in serum IL-6 and IGFBP-2 concentrations during the 12-month observation were positively correlated (R = +0.63). Changes in height standard deviation score (Ht SDS) were correlated with IGF-I serum concentrations at baseline (R =+0.67) and after 12 months (R = +0.70), with IGF-I bioavailability and with IGFBP-1 serum concentrations (R = -0.88). Body mass index (BMI) SDS correlated with IGF bioavailability.;This study showed a relationship between inflammatory status and the IGF system, and an effect of these interactions on longitudinal growth.

Twenty patients with HCC and twenty patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD) were recruited for the study. Twenty healthy non-HCV infected subjects were also included as negative controls. Serum complements C3 and C4 levels were estimated with nephelometry while HCV antibody was detected by third generation ELISA kits. Serum samples were also tested for alpha-fetoprotein by microparticle enzyme immunoassay kits. Serum levels of complements C3 (124.1 +/- 34.4 mg/dl) & C4 (55.9 +/- 28.8 mg/dl) in cases of liver cirrhosis without HCC, were lower than in HCC cirrhotic patients (136.9 +/- 39.1 mg/dl) and (62.3 +/- 20.7 mg/dl), respectively (P > 0.05). On the other hand, serum levels of C3 & C4 were significantly higher in HCC group than in controls (101.9 +/- 18.7 mg/dl) and (23.8 +/- 8.9 mg/dl), respectively (P < 0.01, P < 0.001). Regarding levels of C3 &C4 in CLD patients, they were significantly higher than controls (P < 0.05, P < 0.001). The optimal cut-off values selected by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve were 112 mg/dl for C3 and 45 mg/dl for C4. Based on these data, the positive predictive values, negative predictive values, and the accuracies for C3 were 59.1%, 55.6%, and 58.1% and for C4 were 65.2%, 75%, and 67.7%, respectively.

Positive D-dimer (>367 ng/ml) correlated weakly with the presence of tumor thrombosis, whereas positive TpP (>5.4 microg/ml) correlated strongly with the presence of tumor thrombosis. By multivariant logistic analysis, positive TpP level was found to be a significant predictor of the presence of tumor thrombosis. In contrast, positive D-dimer level was not found to be a significant predictor for predicting tumor thrombosis.;Increased D-dimer and TpP levels in HCC may suggest that fibrinolysis and coagulation occur continuously during tumor progression.

RNA and DNA were extracted from 3x1.5 mm cores from all foci. Gene expression (730 genes) and copy number (80 genes) were measured using Nanostring PanCancer and Cancer CNV panels. Linear mixed models were employed to compare expression in tumor versus normal samples from the same patient, and to assess heterogeneity (variability) in expression among multiple ILC within an individual.;35 and 34 genes were upregulated (FC>2) and down-regulated (FC<0.5) respectively in ILC tumor relative to adjacent normal tissue, q<0.05. 9/34 down-regulated genes (FIGF, RELN, PROM1, SFRP1, MMP7, NTRK2, LAMB3, SPRY2, KIT) had changes larger than CDH1, a hallmark of ILC. Copy number changes in these patients were relatively few but consistent across foci within each patient. Amplification of three genes (CCND1, FADD, ORAOV1) at 11q13.3 was present in 2/11 patients in both foci. We observed significant evidence of within-patient between-foci variability (heterogeneity) in gene expression for 466 genes (p<0.05 with FDR 8%), including CDH1, FIGF, RELN, SFRP1, MMP7, NTRK2, LAMB3, SPRY2 and KIT.;There was substantial variation in gene expression between ILC foci within patients, including known markers of ILC, suggesting an additional level of complexity that should be addressed.",

At the assay cut-point where sensitivity and specificity were equal, the Mcm5 test detected primary and recurrent bladder cancers with 69% sensitivity (95% confidence interval = 62-75%) and 93% negative predictive value (95% CI = 92-95%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for Mcm5 was 0.75 (95% CI = 0.71-0.79) and 0.72 (95% CI = 0.67-0.77) for NMP22. Importantly, Mcm5 combined with NMP22 identified 95% (79/83; 95% CI = 88-99%) of potentially life threatening diagnoses (i.e. grade 3 or carcinoma in situ or stage ≥pT1) with high specificity (72%, 95% CI = 69-74%).;The Mcm5 immunoassay is a non-invasive test for identifying patients with urothelial cancers with similar accuracy to the FDA-approved NMP22 ELISA Test Kit.

There were 68 patients with ductal carcinoma of the pancreas, 24 with other pancreatic tumors, 57 with acute pancreatitis, 29 with chronic pancreatitis (CP), 90 with benign disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract, and 32 with malignant disease. The test for CA 242 consisted of a DELFIA research kit (WALLAC OY, Turku, Finland) with a cutoff level of 20 U/ml. The other markers were tested with commercially available kits.;Sensitivities for PC in this population, with other malignant neoplasms accounting for 16% of the group, were 66.2%, 70.6%, and 70.6% for CA 242, CA 19.9, and CA 50, respectively (90% specificity level).

HR HPV was detected in scrape specimens (Amplicor HPV test; Roche Molecular Systems), and the individual genotypes in these specimens were identified (HPV GenoArray test kit; Hybribio Ltd., Hong Kong). Forty-one (49%) specimens were positive by the Amplicor HPV test. Sixty-four samples (41 positive and 23 negative by the Amplicor HPV test) were also assayed by use of the HPV GenoArray kit. The overall level of agreement between the two assays was 93.8% (Cohen's kappa = 0.98). HR genotypes were found in 37/41 (90%) HPV-positive samples. The prevalences of the HR HPV genotypes in the 37 HPV-positive samples were 41% of patients for HPV type 16 (HPV-16), 22% for HPV-39, 19% for HPV-52, and 14% for HPV-18. Forty-one percent of these patients were infected with a single HR genotype, whereas 59% were infected with mixtures of HR genotypes. The presence of a relatively high percentage of HPV types 39 and 52 and the relatively high incidence of infections with mixtures of genotypes may be one of the reasons for the low rate of conversion from high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions to invasive carcinoma in Israeli women.

In this research, we integrate c-kit immunostaining, 3-D microscopy with optical clearing, and image rendering to present the location-dependent network orientations with high definition. Full-depth colonic tissues were obtained from colectomies performed for nonobstructing carcinoma. Specimens of colon wall were prepared away from the tumor site. C-kit and nuclear fluorescent staining were used to identify the ICC processes and cell body. Optical clearing was used to generate transparent colon specimens, which led to panoramic visualization of the fluorescence-labeled ICC networks at the myenteric plexus (ICC-MY), longitudinal (ICC-LM) and circular (ICC-CM) muscles, and submucosal boundary (ICC-SM) up to 300 μm in depth via confocal microscopy with subcellular level resolution. We observed four distinct network patterns: 1) periganglionic ICC-MY that connect with ICC-LM and ICC-CM, 2) plexuses of ICC-LM within the longitudinal muscle and extending toward the serosa, 3) repetitive and organized ICC-CM layers running parallel to the circular muscle axis and extending toward the submucosa, and 4) a condensed ICC-SM layer lining the submucosal border. Among the four patterns, the orderly aligned ICC-CM layers provide an appropriate target for quantitation.

The aim of the study was to examine whether ERBB2 amplification has any effect on circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) in breast cancer patients.;Fifty patients with primary breast carcinoma, classified as either ERBB2 (+) or (-) by the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique, were included in the study. Cytokines were studied by ELISA according to the procedure described in the commercial kit.;IL-2 levels were found significantly higher in ERBB2+ patients than in controls (p<0.05). A significant negative correlation existed between ERBB2 positivity and estrogen receptor status (p=0.004). Plasma TNF-alpha and IL-2 levels were positively correlated in ERBB2+ breast cancer patients (p<0.01).;The increase in IL-2 concentrations observed in our study suggests an activation of T cells by ERBB2 peptides.",

Thus, this study was performed to clarify whether EGCG affects invasion and migration of salivary gland tumors. Matrigel invasion assay, wound scratch assay and migration assay using commercial kit were performed. beta1 integrin expression and activation of its downstream molecules such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were examined by Western blot. Enzymatic activity of matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 was examined by gelatin zymography. EGCG inhibited effectively invasion and migration of SGT cells in a dose-dependent manner. EGCG also inhibited the activation of beta1 integrin-downstream molecules such as FAK, AKT and ERK as well as the expression of beta1 integrin itself. Moreover, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and their enzymatic activity were reduced by EGCG in a dose-dependent manner.

We clinically defined a type of distinct PVTT (dPVTT) in small HCC patients that is distant to liver parenchyma tumor (PT). The biological features of dPVTT are not clear. We utilized two-dimensional electrophoresis and tandem MS to compare and identify differentially expressed proteins between dPVTT and PT tissues. Of the 65 spots identified as differentially expressed (p < 0.05) between the two cancerous tissues, 19 (corresponding to 19 unique proteins) were identified. Further analysis of five proteins confirmed quantitative differences between the two tumor tissues. Upon comparison with PT tissues of HCC, c-kit was also significantly upregulated in dPVTTs in small HCC patients and the CSQT-2 cell line derived from dPVTT tissues, which validated the differences between the dPVTT and PT tissues. The protein expression profiles and proteins identified in this study demonstrate the presence of dPVTTs with more malignant phenotypes and will be useful in clarifying the mechanisms through which dPVTT develops. Specific treatments targeting dPVTT might be applied to HCC patients with dPVTT.",

The aim of this study was to clarify, through the exploration of angiogenesis and apoptosis, which compartment is more important for the biologic behavior of carcinosarcoma. Paraffin sections from 10 uterine carcinosarcomas were stained by using anti-CD34 monoclonal antibodies for quantifying tumor vascularization. DNA nick was labeled immunostained by using an Apop Tag in situ apoptosis detection kit for exploring apoptosis. In addition, immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67 labeling index (LI) was conducted for evaluating cell proliferation. Although there was no significant difference in Ki-67 LI between SCs and CCs (P =.06), the microvessel density (MVD) in CCs was significantly higher than in SCs (P =.003), and the apoptotic index (AI) was significantly higher in SCs than in CCs (P =.002).

Its efficacy and mechanisms were compared with sorafenib. SL1122-37 significantly prevented PLC/PRF/5 cell proliferation as estimated by colorimetric assay. Flow cytometry analysis showed the induction of apoptosis and arrest of cell cycle in G1 phase. Western blotting showed the decrease of cyclin D1 and regulation of apoptotic proteins. Further analysis suggested that these effects of SL1122-37 might arise from its roles in the inhibition of multi-kinases, including c-Kit and its downstream targets and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in PLC/PRF/5 cells. SL1122-37 also possessed the activity of antiangiogenesis, showing the prevention of HUVEC migration and capillary tube formation. Western blotting indicated the inhibition of VEGF and phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in HUVECs.

Current scientific knowledge indicates that surgeons should broaden indications for this procedure. For example, the use of immunohistochemical markers such as OCT/3-4, TSPY, Kit ligand (SCF) and ALPP (PLAP) has considerably facilitated the detection of germ cell tumour precursors, such as carcinoma in situ and/or gonadoblastoma. These markers are very important for evaluating malignancy risk in undervirilized patients with 46,XY disorders of sexual development. Testicular histology is also of considerable value in the prediction of both fertility potential and risk of cancer in individuals with undescended testes, particularly those with intraabdominal undescended testes. New possibilities for the preservation of fertility after gonadotoxic chemotherapy - even for prepubertal boys - are emerging. Cryopreservation of testicular tissue samples for the preservation of fertility - although still an experimental method at present - is appealing in this context. In our opinion, testicular biopsy in prepubertal boys is a minor procedure that can provide valuable information for predicting the risk of malignancy and fertility, and might be useful in fertility preservation in the near future.

These results were compared with an allele-specific PCR-based kit using dual-priming oligonucleotides (AS-PCR). Any discordant results between the two tests were also analyzed by mutant enrichment with 3'-modified oligonucleotide sequencing. A total of 128 cases were confirmed histologically; of these, 121 were diagnosed as papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The BRAF mutation was detected by Real-Q and AS-PCR testing in 80.2% (95% CI, 71.9%-86.9%) and 76.9% (95% CI, 68.3%-84.0%), respectively, of FNA specimens with PTC. Combining the BRAF V600E molecular assays (Real-Q and AS-PCR) with cytological diagnoses of malignant and suspicious for malignant cells, the detection rates (sensitivity) of Real-Q and AS-PCR for diagnosis of PTC increased to 94.2% (95% CI, 88.4%-97.6%) and 92.6% (95% CI, 86.4%-96.5%), respectively.

This study aims to explore the effects of chrysophanol on the mRNA expressions of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and lipid metabolism in human liver carcinoma Huh-7 cells, which is one of the active compounds obtained from Rhubarb. A reporter gene assay was used to test the transcription of SREBP. The intracellular triglyceride and total cholesterol contents were measured by using commercially available test kits. The SREBPs target genes expressions were measured by Quantitative Real-Time PCR. Cell viability was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8. As the results shown, chrysophanol (40 μmol · L(-1), 16 h) could notably inhibited human SRE promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner and decrease intracellular cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Furthermore, the mRNA expressions of SREBPs target genes were significantly downregulated by chrysophanol treatment. However there are no significant differences on cell viability when compared with the control group. These results suggested that chrysophanol might improve lipid metabolism through suppressing the mRNA expressions of SREBPs target genes to attenuate intracellular lipid accumulation.",

During a transfection experiment conducted by transfecting osteosarcoma cells with ILK siRNA, VEGF concentrations were measured using an ELISA kit, and then compared with those of untransfected controls to evaluate its angiogenic effects. In addition, apoptotic percentages were measured by Annexin-V flow cytometry, and invasive properties were evaluated by measuring the numbers of non-migrating cells in a Boyden chamber.

Sprague Dawley rats were given CCl4 and lliquiritigenin alone or simultaneously for 8 weeks before liver was harvested to check histological changes by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, apoptosis by TUNEL assay, ROS by dihydroethidium staining, antioxidant enzyme activities and malondialdehyde using specific kits, and gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Chronic CCl4 exposure caused profound changes in liver histology with extensive hepatocyte death (necrosis and apoptosis), fat accumulation, and infiltration of inflammatory cells, accompanied by depressed activities of antioxidant enzymes, increased oxidative stress, elevated expression of inflammation and fibrotic genes, and downregulation of PGC-1α, ND1, and Bcl-x in rat liver. All these changes were abolished or alleviated by lliquiritigenin. The results demonstrated that liquiritigenin is effective in protecting liver from injury or treating chronic liver diseases. The modulation of PGC-1α and its downstream genes might play a critical role in relieving CCl4-induced hepatic pathogenesis by liquiritigenin. ",

However, no patients in the Bax-positive group (11/22 cases) after preoperative chemoradiotherapy had recurrence of maxillary SCC and all were alive after 5 years, while the 5-year survival rate was 34.1% in Bax-negative patients.

Our data indicate that imatinib has negligible antineoplastic activity against ATC cell lines within established therapeutically useful concentrations.

In advanced disease, therapy options are limited and relapse and metastasis are common. Systemic therapy with cytotoxic drugs such as doxorubicin and cisplatin achieves low objective response rates (typically <10%) and even sorafenib, an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor considered a breakthrough when introduced, prolongs median survival by little more than a year. Sorafenib blocks platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, c-KIT and rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma signaling, and belongs to a new class of targeted drugs. It has become standard treatment for advanced-stage HCC in recent years. To date, no other agent has been shown to be more effective than sorafenib in the clinical setting, which highlights the need for ongoing research to address this important clinical challenge.

Characteristics of ASCP include central tumor necrosis, along with osteoclasts and hypercalcemia. Various theories exist as to why this histological subtype exists, as normal pancreas tissue has no benign squamous epithelium. Due to the rarity of this disease, limited molecular analysis has been performed, and those reports indicate unique molecular features of ASCP. In this paper, we characterize 23 patients diagnosed with ASCP through molecular profiling using immunohistochemistry staining, fluorescent in situ hybridization, chromogenic in situ hybridization, and gene sequencing, Additionally, we provide a comprehensive literature review of what is known to date of ASCP. Molecular characterization revealed overexpression in MRP1 (80%), MGMT (79%), TOP2A (75), RRM1 (42%), TOPO1 (42%), PTEN (45%), CMET (40%), and C-KIT (10%) among others. One hundred percent of samples tested were positive for KRAS mutations. This analysis shows heretofore unsuspected leads to be considered for treatments of this rare type of exocrine pancreas cancer.

We extracted 232 paraffin-embedded samples from a metastatic colorectal cancer clinical trial. For all the cases, EGFR expression was assessed with the FDA approved Dako EGFR pharmaDx kit, the Zymed EGFR kit and the Ventana EGFR 3C6 antibody. Different cut-off values were tested, and the intensity was scored 0, 1+, 2+, 3+ following Dako's recommendations. The percentage of positive cases varied from 93 to 75% with a cut-off of value 1% of positive cells, from 80 to 61% with a cut-off of 5% positive cells and from 72% to 48% with a cut-off value of 10%. Both Ventana and Zymed tests were more sensitive than the Dako test (Ventana >Dako; p<10(-7), Zymed >Dako; p=2.10(-6)). No difference was noted between Ventana and Zymed tests (p=0.75). A high concordance was observed for the 3 tests for the evaluation of high intensities. The use of a scoring system combining the percentage of positive cells and intensity was not useful for Zymed and Ventana as the intensity of staining is correlated to the percentage of positive cells: Ventana (p<10(-6)) and Zymed (p<10(-5)). No interaction with staining was identified for any of the fixatives, or with the nature of samples received (i.e. slides vs blocks, biopsies vs surgical specimens). Our data showed a higher percentage of positive cells detected by Ventana and Zymed tests, whatever the cut-off value for positivity.

In the microenvironment of HCC, GP73 expression levels are significantly elevated. It is this elevation that may prove more specific and sensitive for HCC detection than that of the traditional biomarker, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). This may be especially true if it can be measured and identified earlier in the diagnostic process. We sought to develop a testing platform to measure GP73 levels for the purposes of earlier diagnostic screening of at risk patients. We expressed recombinant GP73 protein to use as an immunogen in order to develop several monoclonal anti-GP73 antibodies. Three clones, 1D7, 2B2, and 5B4, were identified with all three having a higher than 1:5,000,000 titer. These clones were then isotyped and validated to bind the immunogen protein. Different combinations of antibody pairs were then tested in order to create a functional sandwich antibody pair. Using this pair on liver disease patient serum samples, we found that GP73 was significantly elevated when compared to healthy control patient serum (P < 0.0001). Average GP73 levels in HCC patients was 284.0 ng/mL, slightly higher than liver disease patients (265.6 ng/mL), and significantly elevated over normal serum levels is (74.86 ng/mL). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) for GP73 to detect liver cancer was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.95 to 1.00; P < 0.0001), and GP73 levels had a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 87% for detecting liver cancer. By contrast, the sensitivity and specificity of liver disease detection was 76% and 97%, respectively. We then tested detection of 74 serum samples (n control = 46, n liver disease = 7, n liver cancer = 21) by our ELISA testing methodology and commercial kit simultaneously. The results found that our kit and the commercial kit had a good linear correlation coefficient, r(2) = 0.932. Together these clones and our ELISA pair may prove extremely useful in the detection and monitoring of GP73 in HCC and other at risk patients. ",

Previously termed \"islet cell tumors/carcinomas\" or \"endocrine neoplasms\", they are now called pancreatic NETs (PanNETs). They occur in relatively younger patients and may arise anywhere in the pancreas. Some are associated with von Hippel-Lindau, MEN1, and other syndromes. It is now widely recognized that, with the exception of tumorlets (minute incipient neoplasms) that occur in some syndromes like MEN1, all PanNETs are malignant, albeit low-grade, and although they have a protracted clinical course and overall 10-year survival of 60-70 %, even low-stage and low-grade examples may recur and/or metastasize on long-term follow-up. Per recent consensus guidelines adopted by both European and North American NET Societies (ENETS and NANETs) and WHO-2010, PanNETs are now graded and staged separately, unlike previous classification schemes that used a combination of grade, stage, and adjunct prognosticators in an attempt to define \"benign behavior\" or \"malignant\" categories. For staging, the ENETs proposal may be more applicable than CAP/AJCC, which is based on the staging of exocrine tumors. Current grading of PanNETs is based on mitotic activity and ki-67 index. Other promising prognosticators such as necrosis, CK19, c-kit, and others are still under investigation. It has also been recognized that PanNETs have a rather wide morphologic repertoire including oncocytic, pleomorphic, ductulo-insular, sclerosing, and lipid-rich variants. Most PanNETs are diagnosed by fine needle aspiration biopsy, in which single, monotonous plasmacytoid cells with fair amounts of cytoplasm and distinctive neuroendocrine chromatin are diagnostic. Molecular alterations of PanNETs are also very different than that of ductal or acinar tumors. Loss of expression of DAXX and ATRX proteins has been recently identified in 45 %. Along with these improvements, several controversies remain, including grading, value of current cutoff ranges, and the best methods for counting ki-67 index (manual count by computer-captured image may be the most practical for the time being). More important is the controversial use of the term \"carcinoma\", which was previously employed in WHO-2004 only for invasive and metastatic cases but has now been made synonymous with grade 3 group of tumors. It is becoming clear that grade 3 group comprises two distinct categories: (1) differentiated but proliferatively more active tumors which typically have ki-67 indices in the 20-50 % range and (2) true poorly differentiated NE carcinomas as defined in the lung, with ki-67 typically >50 %. Further studies are needed to address these controversial aspects of PanNETs.",

In these subjects, a significant positive linear association between the cytokine values has been found. Vaccine challenge resulted in a marked reduction of TNF-alpha/IL-10 ratios. In addition, a disappearance of correlation between the cytokine values was observed. Such disturbance was related to exuberant elevation of the IL-10 levels after inoculation. On the contrary, in CF individuals, plasma cytokine values remained in strong linear association independently of TNF-alpha or IL-10 predominance. No spikes in the plasma levels of IL-10 in CF patients during a 6-month observation period have been revealed.;There were no fundamental differences between CF and healthy children in the regulation of TNF-alpha and IL-10 secretion.

Our other aim was to compare two different kinds of kits that we use for the detection of Y chromosome microdeletions. Sixty-three infertile males [44 nonobstructive azoospermic, 8 severe oligozoospermic, and 11 oligoasthenoteratozoospermic] were investigated in terms of somatic chromosomal constitutions and microdeletions of the Y chromosome. Sperm aneuploidy levels were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in sperm cells obtained from the semen of six OAT patients. Microdeletion and sex chromosome aneuploidy (47,XXY) rates in somatic cells were found to be approximately 3.2% and 4.7%, respectively. Sperm aneuploidy rates were determined as 9%, 22%, and 47% in three patients out of six. Two of these three patients also had high rates of head anomalies in semen samples. High correlation was found between sperm aneuploidy rates and sperm head anomalies. Since the introduction of the assisted reproductive techniques for the treatment of severe male infertility, genetic tests and genetic counseling became very important due to the transmission of genetic abnormalities to the next generation.

Sera from 59 patients with single hepatic CE cysts in well-defined ultrasound stages (gold standard) and 25 patients with non-parasitic cysts were analyzed by RDTs VIRapid HYDATIDOSIS (Vircell, Spain), Echinococcus DIGFA (Unibiotest, China), ADAMU-CE (ICST, Japan), and by RIDASCREEN Echinococcus IgG ELISA (R-Biopharm, Germany). Sensitivity, specificity and ROC curves were compared with McNemar and t-test. For VIRapid and DIGFA, correlation between semiquantitative results and ELISA OD values were evaluated by Spearman's coefficient. Reproducibility was assessed on 16 randomly selected sera with Cohen's Kappa coefficient. Sensitivity and Specificity of VIRapid (74%, 96%) and ADAMU-CE (57%, 100%) did not differ from ELISA (69%, 96%) while DIGFA (72%, 72%) did (p = 0.045). ADAMU-CE was significantly less sensitive in the diagnosis of active cysts (p = 0.019) while DIGFA was significantly less specific (p = 0.014) compared to ELISA. All tests were poorly sensitive in diagnosing inactive cysts (33.3% ELISA and ADAMU-CE, 42.8% DIGFA, 47.6% VIRapid). The reproducibility of all RDTs was good-very good. Band intensity of VIRapid and DIGFA correlated with ELISA OD values (r = 0.76 and r = 0.79 respectively, p<0.001).;RDTs may be useful in resource-poor settings to complement ultrasound diagnosis of CE in uncertain cases. VIRapid test appears to perform best among the examined kits, but all tests are poorly sensitive in the presence of inactive cysts, which may pose problems with accurate diagnosis.",

To date, over 1,800 mutations have been described related to the causative gene of CF, showing a variable frequency among populations. In a previous extensive analysis of the CFTR locus in 97 Mexican patients, 34 different mutations (75% of CF alleles) were found using several strategies for mutation screening; however, 63% had at least an uncharacterized allele. Despite the combined technologies used, there are still a great number of unknown mutations in the Mexican population.;Screening of the CFTR gene to provide additional evidence of the mutational wide spectrum responsible for CF in Mexican patients.;In this study, the number of unrelated CF patients was increased to 230, 133 new cases and the 97 previously reported to include 63% with at least an uncharacterized allele. Additional tools were used to improve the detection rate of CF mutations, such as a commercial kit for 36 mutations plus a single chain conformational polymorphism method and DNA sequencing.;By using a combination of these strategies we characterized 77.7% of all the CF alleles, resulting in a total of 46 different mutations detected, including the identification of 12 additional mutations (p.R334W, p.A455E, c.3120+1G > A, c.3272-26A > G, c.711+1G > T, p.Q552X, p.W1282X, c.IVS8-5T, p.R1162X and p.R347P, p.D1152H and p.T1036N). Although these 12 mutations have been reported in other populations, they have not yet been reported in Mexican patients.

        "Doc_abstract":"Carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the testis is the pre-invasive stage of type II testicular germ cell tumours (TGCTs) of adolescents and adults. These tumours are the most frequently diagnosed cancer in Caucasian adolescents and young adults. In dysgenetic gonads, the precursor of type II GCTs can be either CIS or a lesion known as gonadoblastoma (GB). CIS/GB originates from a primordial germ cell (PGC)/gonocyte, ie an embryonic cell. CIS can be cured by local low-dose irradiation, with limited side effects on hormonal function. Therefore, strategies for early diagnosis of CIS are essential. Various markers are informative to diagnose CIS in adult testis by immunohistochemistry, including c-KIT, PLAP, AP-2gamma, NANOG, and POU5F1 (OCT3/4). OCT3/4 is the most informative and consistent in presence and expression level, resulting in intense nuclear staining. In the case of maturational delay of germ cells, frequently present in gonads of individuals at risk for type II (T)GCTs, use of these markers can result in overdiagnosis of malignant germ cells. This demonstrates the need for a more specific diagnostic marker to distinguish malignant germ cells from germ cells showing maturation delay. Here we report the novel finding that immunohistochemical detection of stem cell factor (SCF), the c-KIT ligand, is informative in this context. This was demonstrated in over 400 cases of normal (fetal, neonatal, infantile, and adult) and pathological gonads, as well as TGCT-derived cell lines, specifically in cases of CIS and GB. Both membrane-bound and soluble SCF were expressed, suggestive of an autocrine loop. SCF immunohistochemistry can be a valuable diagnostic tool, in addition to OCT3/4, to screen for precursor lesions of TGCTs, especially in patients with germ cell maturation delay.",

Sections were first stained with the commercially available breast cancer test kit (HercepTest, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Parallel sections were then stained with a modified HercepTest procedure. Two different evaluation criteria were compared; the HercepTest score that requires > or = 10% stained tumour cells (as for breast cancer) and a proposed 'Target score' that requires > 67% stained tumour cells. The latter score is assumed to be preferable for HER2-targeted radionuclide therapy.;Using the HercepTest kit, the Target score gave lower fractions of positive primary tumours and metastases than the HercepTest score. The modified HercepTest staining procedure and Target score gave high HER2 values in 80% of primary tumours and 62% of metastases, which is considerably more than that obtained with the HercepTest staining and score. There was a significant decrease in HER2 positivity with increasing distance from the primary tumour. In nine sentinel-node metastases assessed, all but one were HER2-positive. Considering all regional metastases, 74% were positive, and of distant metastases, 47%; 72% of the patients with positive primary tumours also expressed HER2 in their metastases.;When combining the modified HercepTest with customised evaluation criteria, more HER2-positive tumours were diagnosed.

Blood samples (5 mL) were obtained from the patients before surgery or during follow-up to 2 years after surgery. DNA was extracted from the leukocytes by a high pure PCR template preparation kit (catalog No. 1 796 828; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).

We found that the risk of cervical SCC was 9.045-fold higher in individuals with NAT2*5A mutant allele (95% confidence interval, 1.448-56.524; P = 0.018). The frequency of the NAT2*5A slow genotypes in the patients with cervical cancer (23.8%) was significantly higher compared with that in the control group (6%).

However, there was no significant association between the NAT2*6A and NAT2*7A/B fast or slow acetylator status and the development of cervical cancer.

Using an EnVision-Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP; Dako, Carpinteria, Calif) kit, we evaluated the diagnostic value of S-100 protein on tissue microarray sections from 175 cases of renal epithelial neoplasm (145 primary renal neoplasms and 30 metastatic renal cell carcinomas) and 24 non-neoplastic renal tissues. Immunohistochemical stains for pancytokeratin, HMB-45, and Mart-1 were also performed. Western blot using the same antibody (anti-S-100 protein) was performed on 10 cases of renal cell neoplasm. The results demonstrated that nuclear and cytoplasmic staining pattern for S-100 protein was observed in 56 (69%) of 81 conventional (clear cell) renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), 10 (30%) of 33 papillary RCCs, 1 (6%) of 16 ChRCCs, and 13 (87%) of 15 oncocytomas. Among the 81 cases of CRCC, positivity for S-100 protein was seen in 41 (71%) of 58 and 15 (65%) of 23 cases with Furhman nuclear grade I/II and III/IV, respectively. Focal immunostaining was present in 22 (92%) of 24 normal renal tubules. Similar staining pattern was observed in 21 (70%) of 30 metastatic RCCs. Western blotting demonstrated the S-100 protein expression in both renal cell neoplasm and normal renal tissue. Overexpression of S-100 in oncocytomas compared with ChRCCs was confirmed by the data of Western blot and cDNA microarray analysis. Importantly, 14.8% (12/81) of clear cell RCC and 13.3% (4/30) of metastatic RCC revealed an immunostaining profile of pancytokeratin (-)/S-100 protein (+).

PIN patients were divided into two groups: a low grade PIN (PIN 1) and high grade PIN (PIN II-III) patients. The mean (F/T) x 100 PSA value in low grade PIN patients was 27.9 +/- 16.2 (range 17.1-41.2, median 25.1) and has been numerically similar to the respective value in BPH subjects (29.1 +/- 13.2, 15.8-48.0, 27.7). These parameters differed markedly (P < 0.01) from the mean (F/T) x 100 PSA value in high grade PIN patients (16.9 +/- 9.0, range 9.9-24.9, median 16.5). The later values were in turn comparable (P > > 0.05) with the respective value measured in untreated prostate cancer patients (14.4 +/- 10.8, 6.6-21.4, 12.6). Hence, values derived from the measurement of free and total serum PSA level may distinguish low grade PIN that prevailingly remains latent disease from high grade PIN that is in most cases not only early prostatic carcinoma but that is often a precursor of an aggressive neoplasm. The published literature is incoherent regarding the influence of tumor spread on F/T PSA level. The cutoff point that divides BPH from cancer may depend on tumor stage. We have not investigated F/T PSA values related to different stages and grades of prostate cancer. The cutoff point of (F/T) x 100 PSA in our study that divides malignant from benign prostate, or latent from manifest cancer, was tentatively assigned as 18 with a specificity of 91% and selectivity of 69%.

Expressions of AEG-1 mRNA and protein in the 3 group cells were detected by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot. The changes of cell proliferation were examined using CCK-8 kit, and the cell cycle distribution was detected by flow cytometry. Finally, expressions of cell proliferation and cell cycle related proteins were detected by Western blot.;Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot demonstrated that compared with the untransfected and siRNA control groups, expressions of AEG-1 mRNA and protein were significantly down-regulated in the AEG-1 siRNA transfection group (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the untransfected and siRNA control groups (P > 0.05). Furthermore, in vivo experiment confirmed a significant down-regulation of AEG-1 protein in the AEG-1 siRNA transfection group (P < 0.05). In addition, AEG-1 siRNA obviously inhibited the proliferation of SGC-7901 cells at different time points after transfection with AEG-1 siRNA. The percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase in the AEG-1 siRNA transfection group [(61.26 ± 1.25)%] was significantly higher than those in the untransfected group [(46.17 ± 1.91)%] and siRNA control group [(46.46 ± 1.96)%], and there was a significant difference between them (all P < 0.001). Furthermore, the result of Western blotting revealed that down-regulation of AEG-1 expression evoked the down-regulation of cdk2 and cyclin D1 expressions and elevation of p21 expression in vitro and in vivo.;The inhibition of cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest mediated by down-regulation of AEG-1 expression may be closely associated with the changes of expression of cell cycle related proteins including cdk2, cyclin D1 and p21.",

It also inhibits other class III kinases, such as the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor beta tyrosine kinase, c-Kit, and c-Fms, but at higher concentrations. It is not active against kinases from other receptor families, such as epidermal growth factor receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, c-Met, and Tie-2, or intracellular kinases such as c-Src, c-Abl, and protein kinase C-alpha. PTK787/ZK 222584 inhibits VEGF-induced autophosphorylation of kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR), endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and survival in the nanomolar range in cell-based assays. In concentrations up to 1 microM, PTK787/ZK 222584 does not have any cytotoxic or antiproliferative effect on cells that do not express VEGF receptors. After oral dosing (50 mg/kg) to mice, plasma concentrations of PTK787/ZK 222584 remain above 1 microM for more than 8 h. PTK787/ZK 222584 induces dose-dependent inhibition of VEGF and PDGF-induced angiogenesis in a growth factor implant model, as well as a tumor cell-driven angiogenesis model after once-daily oral dosing (25-100 mg/kg). In the same dose range, it also inhibits the growth of several human carcinomas, grown s.c. in nude mice, as well as a murine renal carcinoma and its metastases in a syngeneic, orthotopic model. Histological examination of tumors revealed inhibition of microvessel formation in the interior of the tumor. PTK787/ZK 222584 is very well tolerated and does not impair wound healing. It also does not have any significant effects on circulating blood cells or bone marrow leukocytes as a single agent or impair hematopoetic recovery after concomitant cytotoxic anti-cancer agent challenge.

For adenoviral (Ad)-mediated gene transduction, cultured F4/80-B220-CD11c+ cells were incubated with Ad-MAGE-1. Vaccination of stimulated DC induced T lymphocytes. The killing effect of these T cells against gastric carcinoma cells was assayed by MTT. INF-gamma production was determined with an INF-gamma ELISA kit.

In vivo, tumor sizes of the experimental group were much smaller than both the positive control group and the negative control groups (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that survival of the experimental group mice was significantly longer than the control groups (P < 0.05).

Poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid tumours which lack thyroid-specific gene expression fail to accumulate iodide and, therefore, do not respond to iodine-131 therapy. We consequently investigated whether transfer of the hTPO gene is sufficient to restore the iodide-trapping capacity in undifferentiated thyroid and non-thyroid tumour cells. The human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cell lines C643 and SW1736, the rat Morris hepatoma cell line MH3924A and the rat papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line L2 were used as in vitro model systems. Employing a bicistronic retroviral vector based on the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus for the transfer of the hTPO and the neomycin resistance gene, the C643 cells and SW1736 cells were transfected while the L2 cells and MH3924A cells were infected with retroviral particles. Seven recombinant C643 and seven SW1736 cell lines as well as four recombinant L2 and four MH3924A cell lines were established by neomycin selection. They were studied for hTPO expression using an antibody-based luminescence kit, followed by determination of the enzyme activity in the guaiacol assay and of the iodide uptake capacity in the presence of Na125I. Genetically modified cell lines expressed up to 1,800 times more hTPO as compared to wild type tumour cells. The level of hTPO expression varied significantly between individual neomycin-resistant cell lines, suggesting that the recombinant retroviral DNA was integrated at different sites of the cellular genome. The accumulation of iodide, however, was not significantly enhanced in individual recombinant cell lines, irrespective of low or high hTPO expression. Moreover, there was no correlation between hTPO expression and enzyme activity in individual cell lines. The transduction of the hTPO gene per se is not sufficient to restore iodide trapping in non-iodide-concentrating tumour cells. Future studies will have to concentrate on the possible expression of enzymatically active proteins or the transfer of multiple genes involved in iodide trapping.",

In the present study, we will determine the role and mechanism of MIIP in EC metastasis.;Immunohistochemistry was used to measure MIIP expression in normal and EC tissue. Both gain-of-function (infection) and loss-of-function (siRNA) assays were used to alter MIIP expression levels. The effect of MIIP on cell migration and invasion was measured by transwell assay. F-actin immunofluorescence staining was used to observe the cell morphology. The activation of GTP-loaded Rac1 was evaluated by Rac activity assay kit. Immunoprecipitation/WB was used to measure the interaction between MIIP and PAK1.;We demonstrate that MIIP expression was significantly decreased in EC patients comparing to the normal ones, and decreased MIIP expression in EC tissues is associated with deep myometrial invasion, advanced stage, and the presence of lymph node metastasis. Using both gain-of-function (infection) and loss-of-function (siRNA) assays, we show that MIIP markedly blocked EC cell migration, whereas loss of MIIP led to increase in EC cell migration. We demonstrate that elevated expression of MIIP resulted in cytoskeleton reorganization with decreased formation of lamellipodia. We also provide evidence that MIIP is a key molecule in directing Rac1 signaling cascades in EC. Ectopically expressed MIIP consistently competed with Rac1-GTP for binding with the PAK1 p21-binding domain. Our data show that MIIP and PAK1 bind each other and that a C-terminal polyproline domain of MIIP is required for PAK1 binding. Deletion of the PAK1-binding domain of MIIP reduced cell migration-inhibiting activity.;MIIP may function as a tumor suppressor gene for endometrial carcinoma. MIIP attenuates Rac1 signaling through a protein interaction network, and loss of this regulator may contribute to EC metastasis.",

We aimed to compare the performance of two HPV genotyping techniques in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens from a series of invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cases.;Archival FFPE tissue blocks from 78 SCC cases were initially considered. DNA was extracted from dewaxed tissue sections and tested with the INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra assay (Innogenetics), and the F-HPV typing kit (Genomed) targeting the L1 and E6/E7 regions, respectively.;The INNO-LiPA assay showed a higher sensitivity (98.6%) than the F-HPV assay (78.6%). A total of 12 (17.1%) biopsies showed multiple-type infections evidenced by at least one assay. Among the SCC cases tested, HPV16 and/or 18 were detected in 70% of the cases, and 18.4% of them had multiple infections with other high-risk types.;Our results suggest that the INNO-LiPA assay has a better performance than the F-HPV in FFPE specimens, probably due to its smaller amplicon size and the wider range of detectable HPV types. The prevalence of multiple infections could be higher than previously reported, as evidenced by the combination of the two assays.",

Several virulence attributes have been identified in candidal infection, among which are the hydrolases, including the secreted aspartyl proteinases (Saps). This study evaluated and compared the in vitro level of Saps from Candida albicans in nonsmokers, smokers, and patients with leukoplakia and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Candida cell count (CCC) at 48 h was also assessed. The Sap level was measured by spectrophotometry in 38 clinical isolates of C. albicans obtained from the oral cavity of the four different groups. Culturing was done in yeast carbon base-bovine serum albumin. Speciation of Candida was performed by using a Candida identification kit, and CCC was measured by hemocytometer. Sap levels and CCC were higher in individuals with leukoplakia and OSCC than in nonsmokers or smokers (P = 0.001); however, there was no significant difference in Sap levels or CCC between smokers and nonsmokers (P = 0.529). Further, an intragroup correlation between CCC and Sap level was also observed.

Strophalloside is a cardenolide we recently isolated from Antiaris toxicaria obtained from Hainan, China. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible anticancer effects induced by strophalloside and the underlying molecular mechanism. Gastric carcinoma SGC-7901 cells were treated with strophalloside at various concentrations for different times, and resulting cell viability was determined by the MTT assay, and the motility and invasion of tumor cells were assessed by the Transwell chamber assay. Apoptosis were measured by Annexin V-FITC/PI and Hoechst staining. The changes of mitochondrial transmembrane potential were examined by a JC-1 kit. The expressions of pro-apoptotic protein cytochrome c, caspase-3 and caspase-9 were detected by western blotting analysis. The results showed that strophalloside was capable of reducing cell viability, inhibiting cell growth, and suppressing cell migration and invasion in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Mitochondrial membrane potential declined and the concentration of cytochrome c increased in cytoplasm and caspase-3 and caspase-9 were cleaved into activated states, suggesting that cytochrome c was released from the mitochondrion to cytoplasm and finally activated the caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway.

In addition to OCT3/4, the expression of AP-2γ and NANOG or their variants was detected in urogenital epithelia, while other CIS markers, including PLAP/alkaline phosphatase were absent. A combination of immunocytological staining for AP-2γ or OCT3/4 and rapid cytochemical alkaline phosphatase reaction was subsequently developed. This approach was tested in 22 patients with TGCT. In 14 patients (63.6%), double stained cells were found and thus the method was proven suitable for the detection of CIS cells in semen. In conclusion, transcription factors related to pluripotency and undifferentiated state of cells, which most likely have several variants or modifications, are unexpectedly detected using currently available antibodies in urogenital epithelial cells which may be shed into semen.

Sunitinib, sorafenib and axitinib are kinase inhibitors that inhibit the VEGF, platelet-derived growth factor and c-kit receptor tyrosine kinases. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is directed against VEGF. Temsirolimus inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin. These agents have all shown considerable activity with manageable toxicity in phase II and III studies in both previously treated and untreated patients. In phase III studies, sorafenib and bevacizumab have been associated with prolonged progression-free survival compared with placebo.

Angiogenesis, primarily mediated through vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is one of the key steps in tumor growth and metastasis. VEGF is now a validated target for NSCLC based on the results of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial E4599 which showed that the addition of bevacizumab, a VEGF monoclonal antibody, to cytotoxic chemotherapy improves survival compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with metastatic NSCLC. As NSCLC has complex and integrated signaling pathways, a rational approach is to target more than one of these pathways concurrently. Sorafenib, which is approved for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, is a multitargeted signal transduction inhibitor that inhibits raf-kinases, VEGF receptor-2, platelet derived growth factor receptor-B, and c-kit. In a phase II monotherapy trial in patients with previously treated NSCLC, sorafenib demonstrated activity with a disease control rate and survival rate comparable to other small molecules. Additionally, sorafenib has shown preliminary activity in combination with chemotherapy and with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors.

Therapeutic modalities targeting VEGF, PDGF, and c-kit using tyrosine kinase inhibitors and m-TOR using specific biologic factors are in development. Therapeutic approaches targeting TNF-alpha have shown limited efficacy, while anti-TRAIL (TNFSF10) antibodies have shown enhanced activity. The presence and potential significance of other members of the TNFSF has not been investigated. Here, we assayed the TNFSF members APRIL, BAFF, TWEAK and their receptors (BCMA, TACI, BAFFR, Fn14) in 86 conventional type clear cell RCC, using immunohistochemistry and correlated our findings with histological data and, in a limited series, follow-up of patients. We observed a differential expression of these TNFSF ligands and receptors in cancerous and non-cancerous structures. BAFF was found in all RCC; APRIL expression is associated with an aggressive phenotype, correlating negatively with patients' disease-free survival, while TWEAK and its receptor Fn14 are heterogeneously expressed, correlating negatively with the grade and survival of RCC patients. This is the first study, presenting together the TNFSF members APRIL, BAFF, TWEAK and their receptors in different areas of normal renal tissue and RCC, suggesting a potential role of these TNFSF members in renal tumor biology.",

Biopsy results indicated that the lesion was a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography showed multiple liver metastases and the patient was diagnosed with stage Ⅳ gastric cancer. After a blood transfusion, chemotherapy with S-1 was started. However, as the patient experienced continued hemorrhage from the primary lesion, treatment was changed to total gastrectomy in order to control the bleeding. The pathologic examination of the resected specimen indicated that the tumor was located in the muscle and subserosal layers. The tumor cells were spindle-shaped, c-kit positive, cytokeratin-negative, and Dog-1 positive. Therefore, a diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) was made. Postoperatively, chemotherapy with imatinib was administered and the patient was alive with no progression of disease 1 year following surgery.

FCM analysis displayed rather high ratio (>30%) of successfully transfected LCLs by utilizing the DMRIE-C kit.

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of curcumin on human mammary epithelial carcinoma MCF-7 cells. Cells were treated with curcumin and examined for cell viability by MTT assay. The cells invasion was demonstrated by transwell assay. The binding activity of NF-κB to DNA was examined in nuclear extracts using Trans-AM NF-κB ELISA kit. Western blot was performed to detect the effect of curcumin on the expression of uPA. Our results showed that curcumin dose-dependently inhibited (P < 0.05) the proliferation of MCF-7 cells. Meanwhile, the adhesion and invasion ability of MCF-7 cells were sharply inhibited when treated with different concentrations of curcumin. Curcumin also significantly decreased (P < 0.05) the expression of uPA and NF-κB DNA binding activity, respectively. It is concluded that curcumin inhibits the adhesion and invasion of MCF-7 cells through down-regulating the protein expression of uPA via of NF-κB activation.

Among these adhesion molecules, expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) has been identified in colon cancer, bladder cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the current study, we analyzed serum ICAM-1 concentrations to investigate the relationship between the serum ICAM-1 level and prognosis in patients with lung cancer.;Serum ICAM-1 was measured in 84 patients with lung cancer according to the pathologic type and clinical stage using the ICAM-1 ELISA kit. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyse survival time.;There was no difference in serum ICAM-1 concentration among the different stages of lung cancer. Furthermore, there was no difference observed between histologic tumor type with regard to serum ICAM-1 concentration. Although the difference was not significant, the overall survival times of patients with a low serum ICAM-1 concentration (< 306 ng/mL) was longer than that of patients with a high concentration (> or = 306 ng/mL) in non-small cell lung cancer patients.;These results suggest that high levels of serum ICAM-1 reflect poor prognosis for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.",

In this article, we review current knowledge of pathogenesis of pediatric GCTs, which differs from adult/adolescent GCTs. One distinctive feature is the absence of a progenitor stage, such as carcinoma in situ or gonadoblastoma, which are seen in adult/adolescent GCTs, except spermatocytic seminoma. The primordial germ cell (PGC) is the suggested origin of all GCTs, with variations in histology reflecting differentiation stage. Expression of pluripotency transcription factors OCT-3/4, NANOG, and AP-2γ in germinomas/seminomas/dysgerminomas is consistent with retaining a germ cell phenotype. Teratomas, in contrast, develop through a pathway of aberrant somatic differentiation of immature germ cells, and the yolk sac tumors and choriocarcinomas result from abnormal extraembryonic differentiation. In pediatric GCTs, origin is suggested at an earlier developmental stage because of predisposing genetic factors, although responsible genes remain largely unknown. Some extragonadal GCTs have been linked to overexpression of the KIT/KITLG system, allowing for survival of aberrantly migrated ectopic PGCs. Infant gonadal/sacrococcygeal GCTs may be caused by apoptosis-related pathways, consistent with an association with polymorphisms in BAK1. Although recent advances have identified candidate pathways, further effort is needed to answer central questions of pathogenesis of these fascinating tumors.",

A 42-year-old Japanese woman presented with hematuria and complained of inguinal pain 2 months after the initial symptoms. Radical nephrectomy and renal hilar lymphadenectomy were performed. The tumor was 8 cm in greatest diameter; its cut surface was beige in color. Large metastasis to the renal hilar lymph node was identified. Histological examination of the right renal tumor met the criteria of chromophobe RCC. In addition to histological findings of typical chromophobe RCC, small cell foci, comedo-like necrosis, trabecular growth pattern, and sclerosing stroma were observed. However, no sarcomatoid foci were identified anywhere, despite extensive tumor sampling including lymph node lesions. Immunohistochemically, neoplastic cells were positive for E-cadherin and CD117 (c-kit). Ultrastructurally, tumorous cells contained abundant mitochondria and cytoplasmic microvesicles. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed monosomy of chromosomes 2 and 10 and polysomy of chromosome 21. Finally, we suggest that this tumor may show the poorly differentiated or presarcomatoid form of chromophobe RCC.",

Growth rates were assessed by a colorimetric XTT-based assay kit. Expression of PPAR-gamma protein was examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. All glitazones inhibited in vitro growth and viability of the human neuroblastoma cell lines in a dose-dependent manner showing considerable effects only at high concentrations (10 microM and 100 microM). Effectiveness of the glitazones on neuroblastoma cell growth differed depending on the cell line and the agent. The presence of PPAR-gamma protein was demonstrated in all cell lines.

In this study, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was used to investigate the growth inhibitory effect of 16-DHP. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using flow cytometry. Hoechst 33258 staining and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis were used to detect apoptosis. The levels of proteins were probed by Western blotting, and caspase activities were analyzed using Caspase Activity Kit. We found that 16-DHP inhibited the growth of human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa cells) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The growth inhibitory effect of 16-DHP was associated with G1 arrest mediated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2)-p53 signaling, as demonstrated by induction of the phosphorylations of ATM, Chk2, and p53 proteins. Followed by G1 arrest, 16-DHP-treated HeLa cells underwent caspase-dependent apoptosis. The inhibitors of caspase-3 and caspase-9 but not caspase-8 inhibitor blocked 16-DHP-induced apoptosis. Moreover, 16-DHP increased the level of Bax protein and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, but had no effect on the level of Bcl-2. These results suggested that 16-DHP inhibited the growth of HeLa cells via inducing ATM-Chk2-p53 activation-mediated G1 arrest and mitochondrial cell apoptosis.",

Serum IL-6 and IL-18 concentrations were assayed by ELISA commercial kits in 65 untreated patients and 20 healthy volunteers. Serum IL-6 concentration was significantly increased in patients compared to healthy individuals (p < 0.000).

A total of 380 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cases and 380 controls were recruited for this study. The genotypes were determined using a custom-by-design 48-Plex SNPscan(TM) kit.

Major histologic findings of transitional or intermediate areas of 21 combined HCC-CCs included strands/trabeculae of small, uniform, oval-shaped cells with scant cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei embedded within an abundant stroma, small cells with an antler-like anastomosing pattern, and solid nests of intermediate hepatocyte-like cells surrounded by small cells in periphery, in order of frequency.

HCV seropositivity was determined with HCV antibody detection ELISA kit and was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method.;In this study the overall seroprevalence of hepatitis C was founded to be 0.2% by using ELISA method. However, the overall Hepatitis C virus infection prevalence was found to be 0.13% with RT-PCR method.;Our study suggested that the prevalence rate of Hepatitis C virus is below 1% in the general population of Mashhad.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Granulocytic sarcoma mimicking a synchronous second primary neoplasm (SPN) constitutes a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge particularly in elderly patients. We report on a 75-year-old female presenting with a Core-binding Factor (CBF) AML of M4eo subtype. The patient also had jaundice, highly elevated bilirubin, lipase, alkaline phosphatase (AP), CA 19-9, and a pancreatic mass highly suspicious of infiltrating pancreatic carcinoma. However, a biopsy demonstrated granulocytic sarcoma. Since the patient had no comorbidities and had been in excellent performance status until the diagnosis of AML, induction chemotherapy was initiated, with subsequent normalization of bilirubin, CA 19-9, lipase and AP. Complete hematologic remission of AML was attained and the pancreatic mass could not be detected anymore. Retrospective analysis of the c-kit protooncogene did not disclose activating mutations of exons 8 or 17. Following one consolidation treatment, the patient remained in excellent health until relapse occurred 7 months later and she succumbed to AML. In conclusion, AML can rarely mimic the clinical picture of pancreatic cancer. The initially good response of this CBF leukemia highlights the principal usefulness of aggressive induction chemotherapy also in older AML patients, if they are carefully selected not only according to biological risk factors such as cytogenetics, but also to \"host factors\" (good performance status, lack of comorbidities, etc.).",

This study aimed at investigating the molecular mechanisms of IL-8 production from human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The levels of IL-8 and phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), ERK1/2 and Akt in MHCC-97H cells were measured by ELISA, Western blot and immunofluorescence. NF-κB p65 protein nuclear translocation was determined by non-radioactive NF-κB p50/p65 transcription factor activity kit and cell bio-behaviours were detected by the real-time cell-monitoring system. Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) significantly induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK, Akt and production of IL-8 from HCC cells, which were prevented by SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), PD98059 (ERK inhibitor), LY294002 and Wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor) and SB328437 (CCR3 inhibitor). TNF-α could significantly increase the translocation of NF-κB p65 protein into the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner, while SB203580 partially inhibited. In inflammatory micro-environment, HCC auto-produced IL-8 through p38 MAPK, ERK and PI3K/Akt signalling pathways, where the p38 MAPK is a central factor to activate the NF-κB pathway and regulate the expression of IL-8 production.

At least 18 of these viruses are causative agents of anogenital carcinomas. We evaluated the performance of a resequencing microarray for the detection and genotyping of alpha HPV of clinical significance using cloned HPV DNA. To reduce the number of HPV genotypes tiled on microarray, we used reconstructed ancestral sequences (RASs) as they are more closely related to the various genotypes than the current genotypes are among themselves. The performance of this approach was tested by genotyping with a set of 40 cervical smears already genotyped using the commercial PapilloCheck kit. The results of the two tests were concordant for 70% (28/40) of the samples and compatible for 30% (12/40). Our findings indicate that RASs were able to detect and identify one or several HPV in clinical samples. Associating RASs with homonym sequences improved the genotyping of HPV present in cases of multiple infection. In conclusion, we demonstrate the diagnostic potential of resequencing technology for genotyping of HPV, and illustrate its value both for epidemiological studies and for monitoring the distribution of HPV in the post-vaccination era.

To induce the experimental testicular teratoma, male gonadal ridges from 12-day-old 129/SvJ-mouse fetuses were grafted into the testes of adult mice for 1-12 weeks. The developing tumour was analysed by light and electron microscopy and by immunocytochemical localization of transcription factors SOX9 and c-kit, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and type IV collagen. Testicular teratoma was observed in 36 out of 124 testes with implanted fetal gonadal ridges (frequency 29%). One spontaneous testicular teratoma was observed in this material from 70 male mice (1.5%). One week after implantation intracordal clusters of cells were seen in embryonic testicular cords of the graft as the first sign of testicular teratomas. Four weeks after implantation the embryonic testicular cords had totally disappeared from grafts with teratomas, and the tumour tissue had enlarged the testis and invaded the interstitium of the host testis. It consisted of solitary pieces of immature cartilage as well as of glial cells and of primitive neuroepithelium. Six to eight weeks after implantation the tumour tissue had expanded so that the enlarged testis could be detected by macroscopic enlargement of the scrotum. The testicular tissue of the host had practically disappeared, and only solitary disrupted seminiferous tubules of the host were seen surrounding the teratoma. Neuroepithelial structures of some teratomas cultured for 8 weeks had cells with a granular nucleus as a sign of obvious apoptosis. Eleven to 12 weeks after implantation the growth of the teratoma had stopped, and the histology corresponded to that of a mature cystic teratoma. GFAP, SOX9 and type IV collagen were strongly positive in some parts of the tumours cultured for 4 and 8 weeks, while only occasional c-kit-positive areas were observed in tumours cultured for 8 weeks. As conclusions: (1) the metastasizing capacity of the experimental testicular teratoma is very low during 12 weeks, but the behaviour of the tumour in the testicular tissue of the graft is invasive; (2) the growth of experimental testicular teratomas cease 6-8 weeks after implantation of the fetal gonadal ridges with the obvious apoptosis of the immature tissue components; (3) the model of experimental testicular teratoma in the mouse is suitable for studying how the teratoma affects the host testis and how the host testis reacts to teratoma.",

Levels of transferrin and free iron were determined by analysis of EPR spectra from computerized radiospectrometer EPR -RE-1307 at temperature of liquid nitrogen. Rate of superoxide radicals and nitric oxide generation in tumor and neutrophils of blood was determined by EPR using spin traps at room temperature. Content of ferritin in tumor homogenate and blood serum of rats with GC was determined by ELISA method using corresponding kits. Concentration of active forms of MMP-2 and -9 in obtained samples was determined using method of zymography.;Unregulated generation of superoxide radicals and NO by mitochondria of tumor cells and NADPH-oxidase and iNOS neutrophils via oxidation of iron-containing proteins causes the accumulation of \"free iron\" complexes in blood and tumor tissue of rats able to evoke oxide-induced damages of macromolecules. It has been shown that for resistant strain of carcinoma, as compared with sensitive one, significantly higher concentrations of active forms of MMP-2 and -9 in blood serum of rats are typical. Dynamics of gelatinases activity changes in tumor tissue corresponds in general with dynamics of changes in serum. In tumor tissue of rats the indices of gelatinases activity positively correlate with rate of superoxide radicals generation, content of \"free iron\" complexes, ferritin and activity of transferrin. Cytostatic agent increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and self-amplify rate of superoxide radicals generation. In turn, activation of MMPs via superoxide-depending regulation allows tumor cells to facilitate migration, invasion and finally - formation of metastatic centers. Mentioned above tumor \"oxide phenotype\" determines high level of its aggressiveness and forms corresponding level of drug resistance.;Thus, high levels of superoxide radicals oxidize transport proteins and form free iron pool.

The patients and symptom-free subjects enrolled in this study were from a high-incidence area for both ESCC and CSCC, Linzhou City, Northern China, from 2007 to 2009. The HPV infection analysis was conducted by using an HPV GenoArray Test Kit. We found that the high-risk HPV types accounted for more than 90 % of the HPV-positive lesions of esophagus and cervix tissues. The prevalence of high-risk HPV types increased significantly during the progression of both esophageal and cervical carcinogenesis (positive rate in esophageal tissues: 33 % ENOR, 70 % in DYS and 69 % in ESCC; positive rate in cervical tissues: 27 % in CNOR, 82 % in CIN and 88 % in CSCC; P < 0.001, respectively). Infection with the high-risk HPV types increased the risk for both DYS and ESCC by 4-fold (DYS vs. ENOR: OR = 4.73, 95 %CI = 1.68-13.32; ESCC vs. ENOR: OR = 4.50, 95 %CI = 1.83-11.05) and increased the risk for both CIN and CSCC by 12-fold and 20-fold (CIN vs. CNOR: OR = 12.18, 95 %CI = 3.85-38.55; CSCC vs. CNOR: OR = 20.17, 95 %CI = 6.93-58.65), respectively. The prevalence of high-risk types in ESCC patients was lower than that in CSCC patients (P = 0.005) and was significantly associated with the degree of ESCC tumor infiltration (P = 0.001). HPV 16 was the most prevalent subtype in both esophageal and cervical tissues. Single HPV infection increased significantly along with the progression of ESCC and maintained a high level in cervical tissues, regardless of whether they were CNOR or CSCC tissues.

Female sex was correlated with EpCAM immunohistochemical expression (P=0.035), whereas no other significant relationship with clinicopathological parameters was observed. K19 positivity tended to be correlated with microvascular invasion (P=0.054). In univariate analysis, K19 positivity and microvascular invasion were found to be associated with decreased recurrence-free survival (P<0.001 and P=0.004, respectively) and overall survival (P=0.002 and P=0.029, respectively). EpCAM and CD117 positivity was not correlated with patient survival. In multivariate analysis, K19 positivity emerged as an independent predictor of recurrence-free survival (odds ratio=7.84, 95% confidence interval=2.658-22.912, P<0.001) and overall survival (odds ratio=3.845, 95% confidence interval=1.401-10.549, P=0.009).;Our study confirms the prognostic significance of K19 expression in Caucasian patients with HCCs, providing further evidence that it may be used to stratify HCC according to tumour aggressiveness.",

It is very important to correctly identify those patients who may benefit from trastuzumab by accurate assessment of the HER-2/neu status. Of the various methods available, the Dako Herceptest for immunohistochemical assay is considered the most reliable to reach this goal. The aim of this study was to investigate within a group of Italian laboratories the reproducibility of the results of HER-2/neu assessment by means of the Dako scoring system on slides stained with the Herceptest kit. This study was also conceived as the continuation of one of our previous studies, which was similar in its aims but different in the classification criteria adopted. Our results show that, whereas the intra-observer reproducibility was generally satisfactory, the interobserver reproducibility was not. Moreover, our findings confirm that the two extreme classes (0 and 3+) are more easy to identify than the other two and that the Herceptest does not allow to discriminate optimally between scoring classes 2+ and 3+. These findings are relevant in clinical practice where the treatment choice is based on categories defined by this assay, suggesting the need of adopting educational programs and/or new reference materials to improve the assay performance.",

For comparison, at the cut-off level of 5 micrograms/l the CEA test was positive in 7/40 (18%) cancer cases, and in 6/19 (32%) of cancer patients with nodal involvement. Patients with axillary nodal metastasis showed higher values than patients without metastasis in both tests (p less than 0.01).

The role of caspase activities were assayed using caspase apoptosis detection kit. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the level of Bcl-2/Bax expression. Our results indicate that norcantharidin inhibited HepG2 cell growth in a time- and dose-dependent manner by MTT assay. HepG2 cells treated with norcantharidin showed typical characteristics of apoptosis including the DNA fragmentation. The activities of caspase-3, -9 were up-regulated after norcantharidin treatment. By western blot analysis, we found the level of Bcl-2 were down-regulated, whereas, the level of Bcl-2 Up-regulated.so we suggest that up-regulation of mitochondrial Bax expression and down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression participated in the apoptosis induced by NCTD.

The EDTA plasma samples have been pre-fractionated using magnetic bead kits functionalized with weak cation exchange coatings. We compiled MS protein profiles for 90 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and compared them with profiles from 187 healthy controls. The MALDI-ToF spectra were analyzed statistically using ClinProTools bioinformatics software. Depending on the sample used, up to 441 peaks/spectrum could be detected in a mass range of 1000-20,000 Da; 33 of these proteins had statistically differential expression levels between SCC and control plasma (P < 0.001). The series of the peaks were automatically chosen as potential biomarker patterns in the training set. They allowed the discrimination of plasma samples from healthy control and samples from SCC patients (sensitivity and specificity >90%) in external validation test.

Differential promoter methylation and gene expression in clinical specimens were measured using commercially available bisulfite conversion kits and absolute quantitative PCR, respectively.;Here, we investigated 8 FOXM1-induced differentially methylated genes, SPCS1, FLNA, CHPF, GLT8D1, C6orf136, MGAT1, NDUFA10, and PAFAH1B3, using human head and neck tissue specimens donated by 2 geographically independent patient cohorts from Norway and the United Kingdom. Two genes (GLT8D1 and C6orf136) were found to be differentially expressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Using methylation-specific quantitative PCR, we confirmed that the promoters of GLT8D1 and C6orf136 were hypo- and hypermethylated, respectively, in HNSCC tissues.;Given that epigenetic change precedes gene expression, methylation status of candidate genes identified from this study may represent a signature of premalignancy, rendering them potentially useful predictive biomarkers for precancer screening and/or therapeutic targets for cancer prevention.",

The following results were obtained: GER contents induced the expression of COX-2 in all five cell lines. In normal esophageal cells, cPGES, but not mPGES-1, was detected in the cytosolic fraction. GER contents induced the expression of cPGES in the microsomal fraction. In SCC cells, cPGES was expressed in the cytosolic fraction, and mPGES-1 was expressed in the microsomal fraction. GER contents induced the expression of mPGES-1 in the microsomal fraction. In ADC cells, cPGES was expressed in both the cytosolic and microsomal fractions. GER contents induced the expression of both cPGES and mPGES-1 in the microsomal fraction. In conclusion, our results suggest that GER contents induce PGE2 production in esophageal cells. However, there are different isoforms of PGES in normal cells, SCC cells, and ADC cells.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Angiogenesis is essential for normal tissue and even more so for solid malignancies. At present, inhibition of tumor angiogenesis is a major focus of anticancer drug development. Bevacizumab, a humanized antibody against VEGF, was the first antiangiogenic agent to be approved for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer. The most commonly observed adverse events are hypertension, proteinuria, bleeding and thrombosis. Sunitinib, a small molecule blocking intracellular VEGF, KIT, Flt3 and PDGF receptors, which regulate angiogenesis and cell growth, is approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell cancer (RCC) and malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The most frequent adverse events include hand-foot syndrome, stomatitis, diarrhea, fatigue, hypothyroidism and hypertension. Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, is approved for the second-line treatment of advanced RCC and upfront treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Most common adverse events with sorafenib are dermatologic (hand-foot skin reaction, rash, desquamation), fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, hypothyroidism and hypertension. More recently, cardiovascular toxicity has increasingly been recognized as a potential adverse event associated with sunitinib and sorafenib treatment. Elderly patients are at increased risk of thromboembolic events when receiving bevacizumab, and potentially for cardiac dysfunction when receiving sunitinib or sorafenib. The safety of antiangiogenic drugs is of special concern when taking these agents for longer-term adjuvant or maintenance treatment. Furthermore, newer investigational antiangiogenic drugs are briefly reviewed.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Aromatase is a key enzyme in steroidogenesis and plays an important role in sexual differentiation, fertility, and carcinogenesis. Importantly, a variety of chemicals in the environment may influence its activity and thereby disrupt endocrine function. In the current studies, we developed a novel nonradioactive method for measuring aromatase activity that uses a specific ELISA for estrone along with KGN human ovary granulosa-like carcinoma cells. This cell line has relatively high aromatase activity, and because it lacks 17alpha-hydroxylase, it secretes little or no androstenedione, 17beta-estradiol, or estrone. Therefore, aromatase activity can be assayed simply by measuring the production of estrone in the culture medium after addition of the substrate, androstenedione. Furthermore, by making a slight change in the commercial ELISA kit and optimizing the experimental conditions, we developed a sensitive aromatase assay that could measure a wide range of estrone concentrations with very low interference by androgens. We used this assay to investigate the effects of 23 chemicals that have been previously reported to affect aromatase activity in vitro. We confirmed that 17 of 23 test chemicals had inhibitory or inducible effects, although the specific effects of some were different than previously reported. In conclusion, we have developed a simple, sensitive, and nonradioactive assay that can be used for large-scale screening of compounds that can disrupt endocrine function by influencing aromatase activity.",
