        "Background":"[\"Gene rearrangements involving NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3, ROS1 and ALK result in oncogenic fusion proteins that have been identified in many types of cancer, including lung, colorectal, salivary gland, sarcoma, papillary thyroid, glioblastoma, melanoma and other histologies. Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an orally available, highly potent and selective ATP-competitive pan-Trk, ROS1 and ALK inhibitor. In preclinical studies, entrectinib effectively inhibits target kinase activity and cancer cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth across various fusion partners and cancer types. More importantly, entrectinib's activity has been validated clinically in patients across multiple fusion partners and tissue histologies.Trk inhibitors, including entrectinib, have shown promising clinical activity in molecularly selected patients. Predictably, potential resistance mechanisms have also begun to emerge. For example, mutations in the Trk kinase domain were identified as one of the in vitro induced resistance mechanisms to the Trk inhibitor, Loxo-101. The three reported resistance mutations in the Ba/F3-MPRIP-NTRK1 cell line model treated with Loxo-101 were F589, G667 and V573. The F589 location on TrkA is equivalent to the gatekeeper mutations, L1196 location on ALK and L2026 location on ROS1. These gatekeeper mutations often arise as resistance mechanisms in patients treated with ALK and ROS1 inhibitors. To test the activity of entrectinib against these three reported NTRK1 mutations, we introduced mutated Trk proteins into Ba/F3 and cancer cell lines and performed dose-dependent proliferation studies. Entrectinib was able to inhibit proliferation of cells harboring each of these three mutations that confer resistance to other Trk inhibitors. Particularly, the IC50 values of entrectinib against kinase domain wildtype and gatekeeper mutated (F589) are essentially unchanged (low single-digit nM), which is consistent with the observation that entrectinib is also able to inhibit the gatekeeper mutation in ALK (L1196) in both cell based assays and in vivo tumor growth inhibition studies.In conclusion, our preclinical data suggest that entrectinib is an effective treatment for patients with NTRK-rearranged tumors, including cancers that harbor certain resistance mutations to other Trk inhibitors.\"]",

        "Background":"['Neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinases (NTRKs), or Tropomyosin receptor kinases (Trks), belong to a family of tyrosine kinases that regulate synaptic strength and plasticity during neural development. Deregulated kinase activity of Trk family members due to chromosomal rearrangements, gene mutations, splice variants and overexpression has been shown to be associated with cancer cell proliferation, survival, invasion and chemo-resistance in a number of cancer types. For example, chromosomal rearrangements involving NTRK1-3 have been reported in lung, colorectal, papillary thyroid, glioblastoma, melanoma and other cancers, and have been demonstrated to function as oncogenic drivers in these tumors. Moreover, overexpression of TrkA, TrkB and/or their corresponding ligands has been observed in a number of solid tumors such as breast, lung, prostate and pancreatic cancers. However, the functional implication of Trk overexpression has not been well defined or fully explored as a potential therapeutic strategy.To characterize the expression, signaling and function of full-length Trks in cancer, a series of stable cell lines with full-length NTRK genes were established. The engineered cell lines were characterized for Trk expression, Trk phosphorylation and their response to ligand stimulation. Moreover, cell proliferation, cell transformation and growth inhibition by RXDX-101, a clinical stage, potent and selective pan-Trk inhibitor, were assessed. Trk downstream effectors, such as PLC, AKT and ERK, were also evaluated in the relevant settings. Furthermore, several cancer cell lines with endogenous overexpression of full-length Trks or rearranged Trks were identified and functionally characterized.Our studies highlight the similarities and differences between Trk rearrangement and overexpression as potential oncogenic drivers and support further exploration of RXDX-101 in cancers with Trk overexpression.']",

        "Background":"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults and comprises a heterogeneous group of diseases. A number of recurrent leukemogenic gene mutations or chromosomal rearrangements have been identified and clinically validated in AML. However, nearly 50% of AML patient samples lack any known AML driver mutations. Advances in molecular diagnostics have resulted in the identification of novel and actionable gene mutations or chromosomal rearrangements in these AML samples. The ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene is one such rearrangement identified in samples from patients with AML. Fusion of ETV6 sequences to the tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK3 results in constitutive activation of the TRKC kinase and ETV6-NTRK3 expression has emerged as one of the key oncodrivers for leukemogenesis. Constitutive activation of TRK family tyrosine kinases has also been detected in a wide range solid tumor and hematologic malignancies, including lung, colorectal, salivary gland, sarcoma, thyroid, glioblastoma, melanoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and Philadelphia-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an investigational, orally available, brain-penetrant, highly potent and selective kinase inhibitor with low nanomolar potency against TRKA/B/C, ROS1 and ALK kinase activities (encoded by NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 and ALK genes, respectively). In these studies, we have demonstrated sensitivity to entrectinib in AML cell lines with endogenous expression of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene. Entrectinib treatment blocked cell proliferation and survival in vitro with sub-nanomolar EC50 values. Phosphorylation of the ETV6-TRKC fusion protein as well as phosphorylation of known TRKC downstream signaling effectors was inhibited by entrectinib treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Sensitivity to entrectinib was dependent on expression of the TRKC fusion protein. In xenograft models, entrectinib treatment at clinically relevant doses resulted in tumor regression, which was accompanied by elimination of residual cancer cells from the bone marrow. The clinical relevance of activated oncogenic tyrosine kinases resulting from chromosomal rearrangements has been validated by the efficacy of selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Our preclinical data demonstrate the potential of entrectinib as an effective treatment for patients with NTRK rearranged acute myeloid leukemias and provide rationale for the clinical development of entrectinib in molecularly defined hematologic malignancies. Entrectinib is currently the subject of an ongoing global Phase 2 basket study enrolling patients across multiple tumor histologies containing TRK, ROS1 or ALK fusions.']",

It has been hypothesized that CTCs could be used as a liquid biopsy to obtain repeat molecular characterizations and provide dynamic insight into the biology of an underlying cancer. However, due to the low abundance of CTCs and technical limitations in the single-cell sequencing, it had been very difficult to characterize CTCs on a whole genome scale. The surrogacy of CTCs for conventional tumor tissues has never been demonstrated beyond targeted genomic alterations such as shared ETS fusions in prostate cancer (PC), EGFR mutations in lung cancer and BRAF mutations in melanoma. With recent technical advances in single-cell sequencing and single-CTC isolation technologies, we present the first study using whole genome sequencing (WGS) of isolated serially-collected single CTCs in a PC patient.Method\", ' By combining NanoVelcro CTC Chip with laser microdissection, we developed a robust platform for single-CTC isolation. Subsequent WGS was performed after the multiple displacement amplification of our single-CTC DNA. From a PC patient, we performed WGS on four of his CTCs on two different time point, his primary prostatectomy tissue and liver metastasis along with WBC and normal adjacent tissue from the prostatectomy as controls. Copy number variations, single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and structural variations (SVs), including rearrangements were identified for comparison.Results', ' We successfully performed WGS on isolated single CTCs, achieving 30X depth and >95% coverage. SNV analysis reveals that 33.5% (289/863) of founder somatic mutations (defined as mutations shared between primary and metastatic tumors) can be found in CTCs. Looking into the mutational landscape of CTCs, 48% of the CTC mutations can be traced back to either primary or metastatic tumor. Per SV analysis, we found and validated an intrachromosomal rearrangement in chr3 and an interchromosomal rearrangement between chr13 and chr15. These rearrangements are shared between both tumor tissues and most of the CTCs, but not discovered in WBC and normal adjacent tissue. At the same time, highly heterogeneous short SVs were discovered in PTEN, RB1 and BRCA2 in all tumor samples, suggesting a continuous evolution of SVs in these important tumor suppressor genes.Conclusion', ' Based on our capability to obtain high-quality WGS from single-CTCs, we validate the genomic surrogacy of CTCs by the detection of shared SNVs and rearrangements between CTCs and tumor tissues. The heterogeneous mutational landscapes of SNVs and SVs are also discovered in single-CTCs, indicating the value of our single-CTC WGS approach. We envision our single-CTC WGS approach will be utilized for studying tumor heterogeneity and the biological evolution of cancer during disease progression, even during anticancer therapy.']",

One of the possible applications of iPSCs is to use them as a cell source for producing autologous lymphocytes for cell-based therapy against cancer. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were found to have tumor-reactive T cells and have been used for adoptive cell therapy for metastatic melanoma. The objective in this study is to generate iPSCs from TILs and assess their pluripotency. Under the approved protocol by the Institutional Review Board and the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee, we obtained melanomas from a patient who provided informed consent for tissue procurement and generation of iPSCs. TILs were reprogrammed by Sendai virus (SeV) vector encoding four pluripotency transcription factors (Oct3/4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-Myc). TIL-derived iPSCs (TIL-iPSCs) were characterized by their pluripotency. Within 3 weeks of infection with SeV to deliver pluripotency transcription factors, we identified colonies that resembled embryonic stem cells (ESCs) among the T cell derivatives. TIL-iPSCs displayed typical stem cell morphology and had a normal karyotype. Alkaline phosphatase and immunofluorescence staining with stem cell surface markers, OCT3/4, SSEA3, SSEA 4, TRA1-81 and TRA1-60 proteins suggested pluripotency of colonies. RT-PCR analyses revealed that TIL-iPSCs expressed pluripotent stem cell markers such as NANOG, OCT3/4 at levels comparable to those in ESCs. T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement analysis in TIL-iPSCs confirmed that they originated from mature T cells and retained diversity of TCR gene rearrangement. In conclusion, human iPSCs with diverse TCR gene rearrangement can be generated from TILs efficiently by SeV encoding four pluripotency transcription factors.

Sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, which stimulate an antitumor immune response by selectively inhibiting immunosuppressive cell surface ligands, is known to correlate with high mutation load in the tumor. Numerous somatic and germline defects can cause genomic instability, including alterations affecting the mismatch repair pathway, DNA polymerases, and cell cycle regulators. We describe here the discovery of previously unreported mutations in the promoter of the PMS2 gene that are associated with significantly increased tumor mutation load.MethodsComprehensive genomic profiling by hybridization capture of exonic regions from either 236 or 315 cancer-related genes and select introns from 19 genes commonly rearranged in cancer was used to characterize more than 60,000 clinical FFPE cancer specimens. At least 50 ng of extracted DNA was analyzed per sample and the constructed libraries were sequenced to high, uniform median coverage (>500x). Samples were assessed for base substitutions, short insertions and deletions, copy number alterations and gene fusions/rearrangements. Mutation load is assessed as the number of somatic coding point mutations per megabase of targeted territory.ResultsMutation load from targeted cancer gene analysis recapitulates previous results evaluating whole exome and whole genome mutation load in tumors and cell lines. A novel mutation hotspot was identified in the promoter of PMS2, which codes for the PMS2 protein, a dimerization partner of MLH1 and integral to the DNA mismatch repair complex. Promoter mutations were found in 7.5% of melanoma specimens (n = 101/1348) and 17% of skin squamous cell carcinomas (n = 30/175). In both diseases, PMS2 promoter mutations are the most significant genomic correlate of high mutation load. In melanoma, PMS2 promoter mutant specimens have 4x the median mutation load of the general melanoma population. Skin squamous cell carcinomas show a 2.5-fold increase. Functional characterization is underway to support the hypothesis that these mutations lead to modified PMS2 transcriptional activity, which is known to cause hypermutation.ConclusionsThe growing corpus of cancer genome data continues to enable novel discoveries in cancer biology. Non-coding and regulatory mutations have not been the target of focused study, and our findings extend the small set of regulatory mutations thought to affect tumor development. Our discovery highlights the power of large-scale genomic analysis to uncover additional disease mechanisms, and furthers our understanding of how cells maintain genome integrity.

Remodeling of Ca2+ homeostasis during malignancy is caused by the rearrangement of the Ca2+ signaling machinery, including Ca2+ pumps, Na+/Ca2+ exchangers and channels. Plasma membrane calcium ATPases (ATP2B - or PMCA) maintain the resting low intracellular calcium concentration by pumping out excess calcium from the cytosol. Changes in PMCA expression during malignant transformation have been described previously in colorectal and breast cancer cells, and most recently by our group in melanomas. We found that in BRAF mutant melanoma cells the PMCA 4b protein level was markedly elevated by BRAF inhibitor treatment. Overexpression of PMCA4b suppressed motility and metastatic potential. Previously, it was shown that HDAC inhibitors-induced differentiation up-regulated PMCA4b expression in gastric, colon and breast cancer cells. In the present study we treated BRAF mutant and BRAF wild type melanoma cells with HDAC inhibitors (SAHA (suberanilohydroxamic acid) or valproic acid) and tested the changes in abundance, localization and function of PMCA4b. Expression levels of the PMCA proteins were analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western Blotting. Subcellular localization of the PMCAs and the effects of treatments on cytosolic Ca2+ signaling were analyzed by confocal microscopy. We found that treatment with the HDAC inhibitors increased the level of PMCA4b expression at both mRNA and protein levels in both BRAF wild type and BRAF mutant cell types. The increased PMCA4b level was coupled with enhanced plasma membrane localization and with a faster Ca2+ clearance after stimulation. Our results show that in melanoma cells the expression of PMCA4b is under epigenetic control and HDAC inhibitors efficiently enhanced PMCA4b expression independent of the BRAF status of cells.']",

Methods', ' DNA was extracted from 40 microns of FFPE sections from a series of 10,428 cases of metastatic breast cancer (mBC). Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries to a mean coverage depth of > 550X for up to 315 cancer-related genes plus 37 introns from 14 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. Results', ' 135 (1.2%) of the mBC featured alterations in BRAF. The median age of the 135 female patients was 66 years (range 27 to 83 years). The primary tumor was used for CGP in 50 (37%) and from metastatic sites including lymph nodes, liver, bone, lung, brain, adrenal and soft tissue in 85 (67%). Using CDH1 mutation as the definition of lobular mBC, 126 (93%) were ductal and 9 (7%) were lobular histology. Activating BRAF alterations included amplifications (48%), SV mutations (39%) and rearrangements (13%). No (0%) mBC had multiple BRAF GA in the same case. 34% of BRAF SV were V600E and 66% were a wide variety of non-V600E GA. 10 (7.4%) of 135 BRAF mutated mBC featured ERBB2 amplification with 1 (1%) having an ERBB2 SV mutation and 1 (1%) having both ERBB2 amplification and SV GA. Of the 115 BRAF GA cases with known hormone receptor status 71 (62%) were ER negative, 44 (38%) were ER positive and 63 (55%) were triple negative (TNBC).

Since clinical mechanisms of resistance (MoR) result in MAPK pathway reactivation, recent efforts have focused on combined targeting of RAF and MEK. The combination of D and T (D/T) increased progression-free survival and response rate compared with D alone (Flaherty et al, NEJM, 2012). The MoR to this combination remain unknown. Methods', '  To look for clinical MoR to combined RAF/MEK inhibition, we performed whole exome (WES) and whole transcriptome sequencing (RNASeq) on tumors from 4 patients (pts) with acquired resistance and 1 pt with intrinsic resistance to D/T. Pre-treatment and post-resistance tumors from all pts were analyzed for point mutations, insertions/deletions, copy number alterations, alternatively spliced transcripts, rearrangements, and expression changes. Results', '  In 2 of 4 pts with acquired resistance, WES identified mutations in MEK1 and MEK2 that were undetectable in the pre-treatment tumors.  In the 3rd pt, RNASeq identified an alternatively spliced isoform of BRAF lacking exons 2-10, also undetectable in the pre-treatment tumor. In the 4th pt, no obvious MoR were seen, though multiple alterations were enriched in the post-resistance tumor. The pt with intrinsic resistance had several alterations in genes that conferred resistance to RAF/MEK inhibition when overexpressed in BRAF-mutant cell lines. Integration of WES and RNASeq data also identified several co-existing alterations that may synergize to increase resistance. Conclusions', '  Analysis of combined WES and RNASeq data from pt samples provides a more complete picture of clinical MoR to MAPK-targeted therapy. Post-resistance tumors from 3 of 4 pts with acquired resistance to D/T had alterations in MAPK genes not detectable in the pre-treatment tumors, suggesting that resistance involves reactivation of the MAPK pathway despite combined RAF/MEK inhibition. Alternative dosing of current agents, more potent RAF/MEK inhibitors, and/or inhibition of the downstream kinase ERK may be needed for durable control of BRAF-mutant melanoma.']",

It has been identified as an oncogenic driver in various malignancies and is currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic target. To date, MET exon 14 skipping by sequencing and MET amplification by FISH have been found to have potential clinical utility in predicting those patients who may derive benefit from MET-targeted therapy. However, little research has been conducted on alternative technologies to FISH such as CISH, which does not require a dark room and can be interpreted by a board-certified pathologist. The purpose of this study is to report our experience with MET amplification across solid tumors using CISH.A retrospective analysis was done on 26,619 specimens analyzed for MET amplification by CISH at a CLIA-certified lab (Caris Life Sciences). The validated CISH assay, previously validated against a FISH assay, utilized a gene copy number > 5 to assess amplification. Concordance and correlative studies were done in MET-amplified, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens analyzed using a cMET IHC (SP44, 2+ or 3+ staining intensity in 50% or more tumor cell membrane) analyzing protein expression. Correlative studies involving co-existing aberrations, including PD-L1 (SP142, any intensity in at least 50% of tumor cells), in this MET-amplified, NSCLC cohort were also performed.MET amplification utilizing CISH was 0.7% (188/26,619) overall. MET-amplified solid tumors included carcinomas such as NSCLC (3.1%, 87/2767), gastric adenocarcinoma (3.8%, 11/293), esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (3.3%, 11/338), and endometrial carcinoma (0.4%, 9/2020) along with non-carcinomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (1.0%, 5/510), uterine sarcoma (1.3%, 5/400), melanoma (0.4%, 2/538), and rare tumors such as placental-site trophoblastic tumor (100%, 1/1) and prostatic neuroendocrine tumor (100%, 1/1). A sub-analysis of MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens demonstrated co-occurring protein overexpression in 92.6% (75/81) of cases. These same MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens were found to have EGFR pathogenic/presumed pathogenic mutations (19.7%, 15/76), ALK rearrangements (2.5%, 2/80), and PD-L1 overexpression (27.5%, 14/51). ROS1 rearrangements were not detected in this NSCLC cohort (0%, 0/76).Our data suggest MET amplification detection utilizing CISH is a viable option for identifying MET-driven cancers. The presence of MET across various solid tumors contrasts with biomarkers like HER2, which are exclusive to carcinomas. A sub-analysis of our NSCLC population shows MET-amplified tumors contains a similar molecular distribution to the general NSCLC population.

This test interrogates all coding exons from 49 core cancer genes, introns for a subset of genes selected for detection of prevalent gene rearrangements, and the TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) promoter region. MSI status is determined from a set of 5 intronic mono-nucleotide repeats collectively associated with microsatellite instability. Targeted DNA regions are captured by in-solution hybridization with complementary biotinylated RNA baits and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq®500 platform. Paired formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples and whole blood samples are analyzed simultaneously for the detection of SNV, INDEL, CNV, translocation and MSI status.

        "Background":"['Characterizing the genomic evolution of cancer is critical to understanding disease progression and identifying potential therapeutic targets. By examining the clonal hierarchy of genomic lesions in common tumors, it would be possible to reconstruct the path of oncogenic events that drive carcinogenesis. Reliable assessment of such paths from high-throughput genome sequencing data is complicated by the admixture of normal DNA in tumor samples and by reduced data signal for highly subclonal events. We introduce an approach that exploits individuals genetic background by using the abundant germline SNP genotype data provided by whole genome sequence coverage to assess the clonality of genomic alterations, including copy number changes, rearrangements, and point mutations.We developed a novel algorithm, CLONET (CLONality Estimate in Tumors), which analyzes patient-specific heterozygous SNP loci (informative SNPs) and mono-allelic somatic deletions to assess levels of stromal DNA admixture and infer the clonal status of each aberration. For every mono allelic deletion, CLONET assesses the allelic fractions of informative SNPs to determine the apparent proportion of normal cells DNA. Next, through a conservative use of simulation-based error estimates, deletions with the lowest proportions of normal DNA reads are considered clonal. For point mutations, the tumor allelic fraction is corrected for stromal DNA admixture level and subclonality is inferred when it differs significantly from the expected value for clonal lesions. Similarly, the proportions of reads that span each side of a putative breakpoint involved in a rearrangement are matched against the expected values. CLONET also addresses tumor aneuploidy by searching for chromosomes with coverage and allelic fractions of informative SNPs not consistent with a diploid genome.CLONET was tested on 55 whole genome sequences from prostate cancers, a highly heterogeneous tumor type, to catalogue the accumulation of somatic alterations during oncogenesis and progression. In 98% of the cases CLONET made confident assessment of admixture and clonality. We observed consistent clonal lesions involving NKX3-1, the 3Mb region between TMPRSS2 and ERG and FOXP1, as well as early point mutations in SPOP and FOXA1. Overall, we observed a higher rate of subclonal protein-coding point mutation versus deletions (p-value < 107). We validated this approach by IHC and FISH for predicted clonal and sub-clonal events. A predicted subclonal homozygous deletion of CHD1 was confirmed by FISH that demonstrated the presence of both nuclei with homozygous and with hemizygous deletion of CHD1. Finally, to assess the general validity of CLONET, we analyzed data from 53 additional tumor genomes, including 25 melanomas and 28 lung adenocarcinomas.In summary, our results imply the existence of consensus paths of tumor carcinogenesis that favor dysregulation of cancer genes in a defined sequence.']",

        "Background":"['Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignant tumor in adults. About half of patients with uveal melanoma will develop metastatic disease to the liver and the lung. These tumors are characterized by mutations in G-proteins (GNAQ and GNA11), activation of MAPK, and over-expression of c-Met. We have previously reported that c-Met inhibition inhibits tumor cell invasion and metastasis formation in uveal melanoma. Altiratinib is a selective inhibitor for c-Met as well as TIE2, VEGFR2 and TRK kinases. We found that this agent had no effect on inhibiting cell growth, consistent with our previous findings with crizotinib. However, it did inhibit invasion of uveal melanoma cells through matrigel in a concentration dependent fashion (25 nM to 250 nM) with inhibition of phospho-Met noted at concentrations as low as 25 nM. Selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, is currently in clinical trial in patients with this disease. We found that treatment with 250 nM selumetinib inhibited cell proliferation but unexpectedly induced a marked increase in cell invasion of GNAQ and GNA11 mutant cell lines. This was associated with an increase in c-Met RNA and protein expression, as well as receptor phosphorylation, after 24 hours of selumetinib treatment. Combining selumetinib with altiratinib inhibited cell invasion to the level of altiratinib alone and continued to inhibit cell proliferation to the level of selumetinib alone. This effect was recapitulated by the knockdown of c-Met by siRNA prior to treatment with selumetinib. In a uveal melanoma xenograft model, the combination treatment of 15 mg/kg altiratinib and 25 mg/kg selumetinib significantly delayed tumor growth compared to vehicle control, altiratinib and selumetinib alone. Western blot analysis of tumor tissue confirmed target inhibition of p-Met and p-ERK in animals treated with altiratinib and selumetinib, respectively. Furthermore, tumor metastasis was inhibited by altiratinib, selumetinib and combination treatments in a uveal melanoma mouse model. These results indicate that the combined inhibition of MEK and c-Met by selumetinib and altiratinib, respectively, may be sufficient to suppress uveal melanoma tumor growth and metastasis. This strategy can potentially be used as therapy for patients with primary uveal melanoma who are at high risk for the development of metastatic disease.']",

We hypothesized that differences among multiple tumors in the same patient may be reflected in heterogeneity of TCR repertoire clonality in TIL. We tested this hypothesis using TCR sequencing in pts with MM treated with pembrolizumab.  Methods', '  Post-treatment samples were obtained from different lesions at the same time points.

To date, several mechanisms of BRAF inhibitor resistance have been reported focusing primarily on single alterations. To address how global rewiring of melanoma signaling promotes resistance, we utilized mass spectrometry based phosphoproteomic and network analyses to identify signaling changes in tyrosine, threonine and serine that occur prior to and following acquired BRAF inhibitor resistance. This comprehensive bioinformatics approach uncovered a resistance interactome consisting of 150 nodes that was marked by significant alterations and the emergence of signaling nodes such as ITGB1, EphA2, EphB4, FAK1, STAT3 and PXN. GeneGo pathway enrichment analysis revealed enhanced cytoskeletal rearrangement, adhesion, integrin signaling, cell migration and extracellular matrix remodeling. Consistent with our bioinformatic predictions, melanoma cell lines with acquired vemurafenib resistance were considerably more invasive than their drug nave counterparts and showed increased trans-endothelial cell migration. Confirmatory Western blot studies showed increased expression and phosphorylation of EphA2 receptor at Ser897, FAK1 at Ser397 and paxillin at Y118. Knockdown of EphA2 in the resistant cultures inhibited ERK signaling and completely prevented cell invasion and trans-endothelial cell migration. Functionally, EphA2 expression appeared to be regulated by an epigenetic mechanism involving promoter methylation and HDAC1. The clinical relevance of these findings was demonstrated in matched pairs of biopsies from patients receiving either BRAF or BRAF+MEK inhibitors, with significant Ephrin A2 receptor expression being observed in a subset of those on therapy. In summary, chronic MAPK pathway inhibition leads to major remodeling of the melanoma signaling network with EphA2 emerging as a key driver of the resistance phenotype.']",

Results', ' TMB assessed via targeted sequencing of ~1.25Mb broadly recapitulates previous results of whole exome TMB analysis.

Of 1,889 lung cancers, 35% had at least one abnormality, only 0.65% had more than one. kRAS was most often mutated (26%), followed by EGFR (8.3%), Alk rearrangement (1.9%) and BRAF (1%).  In 1634 colorectal cancers, 47% had one abnormality, 30% two and 3% three. Commonest abnormalities were mutated TP53 (25%), double mutated TP53 and kRAS ( 17%),  kRAS only (17%) and BRAF (5%).  In 535 melanomas there were 42% BRAF mutants, 22% NRAS mutant and only 2.4% with double abnormalities.

We hypothesize that crizotinib acts on other molecular targets in addition to tyrosine kinases ALK/MET and may play critical role given that there is a complex network of kinases that work together to regulate a number of important cellular processes and different disease signature. Approaching with a comprehensive docking method with our established chemical-protein interactome (CPI) and crizotinib, we have discovered 301 PDB-deposited proteins corresponding to 353 ligand binding pockets among a total of 1,780 PDB-deposited human protein entries. Systemic pharmacology approach also applied including validation the molecular target(s) of TKIs in vitro. Especially multiple human cellular models (including NSCLC and melanoma) and signaling study, luc-reporter, autophagy, apoptosis assay, FACS and NGS analysis applied. Interestingly, crizotinib besides had a high CPI binding score (ZZ_score) of -2.2778 against tyrosine kinase Lck, also had -1.4672, -1.1242, -0.7033 and -1.5384 against MAPK3, S6K, GSK-3 and HDAC 7A, respectively, which indicated crizotinib had potential broad range interaction with both TK and ser/thr kinases. In addition, those crizotinib achieved high ZZ scores against PPAR- (-1.6145) and VitD3R (0.9479), suggesting a high binding affinity of crizotinib with these nuclear proteins. Our preliminary studies have showed that the crizotinib induced autophagy by activated LC3 in vitro and inhibited oncogenic Akt/mTOR signaling in human multiple melanoma cells resulting in G2/M cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, crizotinib increased p21Waf1/cip1 and Foxo3A expression and tumor suppressor miR-146a in human melanoma cells. Taken together, crizotinib induces miR-146a, autophagy and p21 waf1/cip1 may potentially treat other type of human cancer by concurrently targeting tyrosine kinase, Akt/mTOR/Foxo axis and nuclear receptor, shedding a light for future both anti-cancer and anti-metabolic disorder drug discovery and development.

Live since 2004, the 71st release (Nov 2014) describes over 2 million mutations in more than 1 million tumour samples across most human genes. To emphasise depth of knowledge on known cancer genes, mutation information is curated manually from the scientific literature, allowing very precise definitions of disease types and clinically relevant patient details. Combination of over 20,000 published studies gives substantial resolution of how mutations and phenotypes relate in human cancer, providing insights into the stratification of populations and new diseases behind known biomarkers. Conversely, our curation of over 15,000 cancer genome studies emphasises knowledge breadth, driving discovery of new unrecognised cancer-driving hotspots and molecular targets. Our high-resolution curation approach is globally unique, giving substantial insight into molecular biomarkers in human oncology. For example, BRAF is well characterized in skin melanoma, transiently treatable with inhibitors such as Vemurafenib. It is also well known in colorectal cancer, which is largely non-responsive to BRAF inhibitors. COSMIC's unique approach demonstrates the impact of BRAF mutations in much less well-known cancers, for instance, Hairy Cell Leukaemia (89% of samples mutated) and Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (49%), both of which respond remarkably well to BRAF inhibitors. Converse to skin melanoma, our curations suggest BRAF has a minimal role in Uveal melanoma (6% of Uveal tumors mutated for BRAF), with higher mutation rates in other genes (particularly GNA11, BAP1 and GNAQ), suggesting different mechanisms behind this disease.In addition to describing over two million coding point mutations across cancer, COSMIC also details more than six million non-coding mutations, 10,567 gene fusions, 61,232 genome rearrangements, 702,652 abnormal copy number segments, and more than 6 million abnormal expression variants. All these types of somatic mutation are annotated to both the human genome and each affected coding gene, then correlated across disease and mutation types. As increasing amounts of genetic data are gathered into COSMIC across human cancer, our annotations are beginning to emphasise events with a higher impact in cancer, highlighting the more functional coding mutations and major amplifications and deletions. This concept of high-impact data is being extended across the entire COSMIC system, much more strongly defining genes and mutations which drive oncogenesis.\"]",

        "Background":"['There have been significant advances in the past few years with regard to BRAF-targeted therapy for metastatic melanoma, however the majority of patients have disease progression within 6 to 7 months. We have previously shown that BRAF inhibition in melanoma in vitro is associated with an increase in melanoma antigens and increased reactivity to antigen specific T cells. More recently, we corroborated these findings in vivo in patients with melanoma undergoing treatment with BRAF inhibitors, demonstrating an increase in melanoma antigens and a significant increase in CD8+ T cells following treatment. However, the nature of this immune response to BRAF inhibition is poorly understood. The goal of the present studies is to better define the T cell infiltrate, so that we can develop a therapeutic strategy to leverage their presence.To do this, we performed tumor biopsies in patients with metastatic melanoma undergoing treatment with BRAF inhibitors at two time-points', ' pre-treatment (day 0), and on-treatment (day 10-14). Biopsies were also taken at time of progression when applicable. DNA was isolated and the CDR3 regions of rearranged TCR beta chain genes within the tumor were sequenced and analyzed using the immunoSEQ platform by Adaptive Biotechnologies. Results demonstrated a significant increase in the clonality in the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in 7 of the 8 patients in on-treatment vs. pre-treatment samples, suggesting that treatment with a BRAF inhibitor may induce an antigen-specific T cell response. We also sought to determine if the increase in T cells associated with BRAF inhibition is related to an infiltration of new T cell clones or a proliferation of existing clones within the tumor. To study this, we analyzed the total T cell clones in these patient samples with regard to their presence or absence in the pre-treatment compared to on-treatment samples. Results demonstrate that over 80% of the individual clones detected after initiation of BRAF-targeted therapy are new clones, suggesting that this therapy is associated with an influx of TIL into the tumors. However, if attention is focused only on the most prevalent clones rather than the total clones, there is a dichotomous relationship between change in clonal populations and magnitude of tumor regression. Namely, those who have persistence of the same dominant clones had a good treatment response, whereas those who had a change in the dominant clonal populations had a poor response. Taken together, this data suggest that though BRAF inhibition in melanoma results in infiltration of new TIL, response to treatment is dependent on a pre-existing population of TIL clones. This data has important clinical implications, and may ultimately help predict who is likely to derive the greatest benefit from BRAF-targeted therapy. A better understanding of this response may also guide us in developing rational combination therapy in the treatment of melanoma.']",

Deregulation of RB1 is important in many cancers. Survivors of hereditary retinoblastoma, caused by a germline mutation in RB1, experience substantially elevated risks for subsequent neoplasms, particularly bone and soft tissue sarcomas and melanomas. Oncogenic RB1 mutations arise from a range of DNA alterations and occur throughout the gene. No previous study has evaluated how the specific location and functional consequences of these RB1 mutations may differentially confer risk for specific subsequent neoplasms. As part of a biomarker study nested within a long-term follow-up study of the risk of subsequent cancers in retinoblastoma survivors, we identified germline RB1 mutations in 76/80 (95%) survivors of hereditary retinoblastoma who developed at least one subsequent neoplasm and had sufficient DNA for mutation testing (median follow-up time=47 years, range 7-71 years). Survivors were classified into four groups according to whether they ever developed a soft tissue sarcoma (STS, N=47), melanoma (without STS, N=10), bone tumor (without STS, N=5), or another type of subsequent malignant neoplasm (N=14). The identified mutations were distributed throughout RB1, from the promoter through exon 25. Nonsense, frameshift, or splice mutations that resulted in premature termination of the RB1 residue sequence were identified in 51 (67%) survivors, with the remaining classified as having loss of multiple exons (N=6), loss or rearrangement of a single exon (N=5), a splice mutation (N=7), a missense mutation (N=4), or an intronic substitution with unknown consequence (N=3). Preliminary analyses indicated that RB1 mutations resulting in loss of >2 exons were more common in survivors with a subsequent STS (40/47, 85%) than those with a subsequent melanoma (6/10, 60%) or bone tumor (2/5, 40%; Fisher's exact P<0.001). In an analysis of the RB1 regions impacted by the mutation, those that affected E2F binding (including mutations affecting the E2F binding site, Domain B, or Domain C) were more common in survivors with a subsequent STS (46/47, 98%) or melanoma (9/10, 90%) than those with a bone tumor (2/5, 40%; Fisher's exact P=0.020). Further analyses will include 14 additional survivors who developed a subsequent neoplasm for whom mutation testing is ongoing, and comparison of the spectrum of RB1 mutations in these survivors to hereditary retinoblastoma survivors without a subsequent neoplasm.

In an effort to better understand the underlying mechanism, the T-cell population in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was characterized. The complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) of the rearranged T cell receptor variable  chain genes (TCR V) was sequenced. This was performed using gDNA extracted from the PBMCs of twenty-one patients that were treated with antibody to Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) (tremelimumab) and seven patients that were treated with antibody to the Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) blockade (MK-3475) at baseline and at day 30-60 post first treatment. Four healthy donors were also sequenced as controls. Control PBMCs displayed random distribution with three patients showing a decrease and one showing an increase in the number of unique productive sequences (UPS) from baseline to the time after first cycle. In PBMCs from patients receiving the CTLA-4 antibody, two out of 21 samples showed a decrease in total number of UPS, while 19 out of 21samples experienced an increase. In PBMCs from patients receiving PD-1 antibody, the reponse was more similar to healthy donors as 5 out of 7 (71%) displayed a decrease and 2 out 7 (29%) an increase in total UPS from the pre to post timepoint. There was an increase in the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) after CTLA-4 blockade therapy (p=0.03), but not in the samples from patients treated with PD-1 antibody (p=0.53). A direct correlation between ALC increase and increase in UPS for CTLA-4 blockade was ruled out (p=0.1 Spearman Correlation). When analyzing according to clinical response status, all responders to CTLA-4 blockade (4 out of 19) experienced an increase in the number of circulating clones. However, samples from clinical responders to PD-1 blockade showed an increase (2 out of 5) or decrease (1 out of 2) in the circulating pool. Considering the concerning toxicity profile for CTLA-4-blockade versus the mild toxicity for PD-1 antibodies, this data supports a model where CTLA-4 blockade induces a non-specific systemic expansion of T cells, while PD-1 blockade may have more specific effects directly in the tumor.']",

        "Meeting_name":" High-throughput engineering and functional annotation of cancer fusion genes",
        "Background":"['Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are rapidly being incorporated into the clinic to facilitate decisions on cancer patient care. Recognizing this, large-scale efforts by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and others are generating a compendium of genomic aberrations found across major cancer types with the goal of identifying new therapeutic targets. The challenge now is to find ways to identify functional driver aberrations, as targeting driver events or their activated pathways offers the greatest hope of improving patient outcomes. Oncogenic transcript fusions resulting from chromosomal rearrangements represent an important class of such events. The successful targeting of fusion oncoproteins such as BCR-ABL and EML4-ALK with imatinib and crizotinib, respectively, provide strong rationale for comprehensive testing of cancer fusion genes. Unfortunately, the functional interrogation of fusion genes is complicated by the large quantity identified, inability to accurately predict those with driver activity, and significant technical roadblocks preventing fusion gene construction for biological assays. To circumvent these bottlenecks, we developed novel technologies permitting (1) high-throughput fusion gene construction using a novel multi-fragment DNA recombineering strategy with our platform of >35,000 human open reading frame gene clones, and (2) rapid lentiviral delivery of fusion genes to generalized and context-specific cell models to identify those with in vitro and in vivo driver activity and responsiveness to available therapeutics. As proof-of-concept, we used this approach to engineer known fusion oncogenes (BCR-ABL, EML4-ALK, and ETV6-NTRK3) and validated their transforming ability using our in vitro and in vivo driver screening systems, demonstrating our ability to rapidly deliver fusion genes with functional activity. In a pilot screen of fusion genes identified in pan-negative melanoma (i.e., devoid of signature mutations in BRAF and NRAS) by TCGA, we identified multiple uncharacterized BRAF and RAF1 fusion events among others that strongly activate MAPK signaling and exhibit potent transforming activity. Moreover, cells carrying the BRAF and RAF1 gene fusions revealed a marked sensitivity to RAF and MEK inhibitors, a finding that may indicate use of these agents for patients whose tumors harbor these events. We are now scaling these efforts for the comprehensive analysis of uncharacterized gene fusions, ultimately allowing functionalization of thousands of fusion events across diverse cancer types. These systems will reveal the highest priority fusion gene targets to enroll in deep mechanistic biology studies, drug discovery and development programs ultimately leading to personalized treatment strategies.']",

        "Background":"['Despite improvements in treatment, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal cancers, with a continuous increase in incidence emphasizing the need for further research and therapeutic development. In recent years, we have developed a collection of >40 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from PDAC. In order to determine their relevance for anticancer agent testing, we extensively characterized our models for histology features, whole exome mutations (Hiseq 2000), chromosome rearrangements, gene copy number variations (Affymetrix SNP6) and gene expression (Affymetrix U133 Plus2.0).PDAC from 65 patients were implanted into immuno-compromised mice, resulting in the development of 42 PDX models (success rate 65%). The PDAC from which models were established included moderate and poorly differentiated tumors and were heterogeneous for stroma content. In patient tumors, we showed fibroblast activation but not stroma content predicted poor patient outcome (p<0.0001) and success of PDX establishment (p<0.01). Correlating with those of the parental tumors, the resulting PDAC_PDX also showed heterogeneity for stroma content and for murine fibroblast activation. As seen in patient tumors, the PDAC_PDX were characterized by frequent chromosomal instability, with 38% of the models presenting a moderate hypoploidy while the 62% remaining ones showed a hyperploidy. Two models showed hypermutation due to mismatch repair deficiency while the others had on average a lower mutation load when compared to other histotypes such as colon, lung or melanoma tumors. In total, we identified more than 9000 genes altered by homozygous deletions, high gene amplifications and/or mutations, most of the models showed alterations in KRAS (81%), TP53 (67%), CDKN2A (64%) and TGFBR2/SMAD4 (64%) genes. Next, PDAC_PDX profiles were merged with those of patient tumors to determine PDAC_PDX subtypes and were found to be of the classical (61%), quasi mesenchymal (QM) (34%) and exocrine like subtype (5%) according to the 62 gene expression signature established by Collisson et al. 2011. Preliminary biomarker analysis revealed certain associations between genomic alterations and transcriptome subtypes, such as more frequent alterations in the TGFB pathway in classical PDX (80%) compared to QM (47%). Further detailed biomarkers analyses also addressing questions of molecular determinants of stroma content, of fibroblast activation and of sensitivity toward anticancer agents will be presented.Extensive characterization of our PDAC_PDX collection revealed similarities with patient tumors with regards of histology features including stroma content and fibroblast activation. At molecular level, the models showed similar genomic and transcriptomic patterns as those reported for patient PDAC, altogether, proving the value of this collection for drug development investigations.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Unique changes in the TCR repertoire of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes underlie the synergy of radiotherapy with CTLA-4 blockade",
        "Background":"['BACKGROUND', ' Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that target CTLA-4, a negative regulator of T-cell activation, have significantly extended survival of patients with metastatic melanoma. However the number of responders remain low. We have previously shown in the 4T1 mouse breast tumor model that resistance to -CTLA-4 therapy can be overcome by concurrent local radiotherapy (RT) (Demaria et al Clin Can Res 2005). Multiple effects of RT on the tumor microenvironment contributed to its ability to sensitize tumors to anti-CTLA-4 treatment, including enhanced homing of effector T cells to the tumor and formation of stable immune synapses between CTL and tumor cells.Importantly, CD8 T cell responses to the endogenous tumor antigen gp70 were seen only in mice treated with the combination, consistent with the hypothesis that RT generates an in situ vaccine and CTLA-4 expands primed T cells. Here we used next generation sequencing of complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) from rearranged T cell receptor (TCR) variable beta (V) chains to obtain a comprehensive picture of the changes in the repertoire of infiltrating lymphocytes that occur during CD8 T cell-mediated tumor rejection. METHODS', ' BALB/c mice were inoculated with 4T1 cells and thirteen days later, when tumors became palpable, randomly assigned to one of 4 treatment groups (N = 5 mice/group)', ' control, RT alone, -CTLA-4 alone or RT+anti-CTLA-4. RT was given in 2 fractions of 12 Gy on days 13 and 14 post-tumor inoculation. -CTLA-4 mAb (Clone 9H10) was given i.p. on days 15, 18 and 21. Tumors were harvested on day 22 for high throughput sequencing of TCR CDR3 regions performed using the ImmunoSEQ platform. RESULTS', ' We observed distinct and non-overlapping effects of RT and immunotherapy on TIL repertoire. CTLA-4 blockade increased clonality and significantly expanded the top 5 most frequent clonotypes. On the other hand, RT increased TIL numbers and broadened their repertoire by selectively expanding the top 6-20 clonotypes. Importantly, analysis of V/J usage landscape showed that the combined treatment generated the most dramatic changes from baseline with the expansion of several unique V/J combinations not otherwise seen in tumors treated with RT or CTLA-4 blockade as single agents. Significantly reduced diversity of the TCR profile seen only with combination therapy is consistent with antigen-driven TIL clonal expansion.CONCLUSIONS', ' Overall, tumor rejection induced by RT+anti-CTLA-4 is associated with both quantitative and qualitative changes in TIL repertoire. Data suggests that a broader repertoire of tumor-specific T cells may be critical for tumor rejection, and is achieved by coupling the effects of RT, which promotes priming of T cells specific for endogenous tumor antigens, and CTLA-4 blockade, which drives expansion of selected clones. These results have important implications for the therapeutic synergy of radiation and CTLA-4 blockade.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma and malignant pheochromocytoma are known for high MYC expression. MYCN amplification and its over-expression are associated with the worst neuroblastoma disease outcome. Meta-iodo-benzylguanidine (MIBG) is a norepinephrine analogue and a mitochondrial respiration inhibitor. 131I-MIBG has been used for scintigraphic detection of neural crest derived tumors (neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma and melanoma) that specifically uptake MIBG by norepinephrine transporters (NET). 131I-MIBG is also used for targeted radiotherapy of neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma. Non-radiolabeled MIBG had been reported to be cytotoxic to neuroblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism of its growth suppressive effect was not elucidated. Our previous studies showed that FCCP, a well-known mitochondrial respiration inhibitor, destabilized MYCN and MYC in neuroblastoma cells and caused growth suppression. In this study we confirmed that MIBG suppressed growth of neuroblastoma cell lines (SKNBE(2)C, IMR5, Nb69, and SKNAS), and its growth suppressive effect in each cell line correlated with NET expression in these cells. In addition, MIBG suppressed growth of neuroblastoma stem cells derived from SKNBE(2)C. MIBG treatment of SKNBE(2)C and SKNAS resulted in an increase expression of growth suppressive gene (GADD45B) and genes encoding for biomarkers of favorable neuroblastoma (CD44, EPHB6, EFNB2, EFNB3, NTRK1). Treatment of MYCN amplified (SKNBE(2)C, IMR5) and non-MYCN amplified (Nb69, SKNAS) neuroblastoma cells with MIBG resulted in marked reduction of MYCN and MYC expression, respectively in dose and time dependent fashions. Collectively, our studies suggest that MIBG not only targets neural crest derived tumors, but also is a MYCN/MYC destabilizing agent.']",
