We aim to evaluate the clinical characteristics and molecular profile of ROS1-rearranged patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Methods', ' Between December 2013 and December 2014, we screened 708 NSCLC patients using reverse transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay and correlated ROS1 rearrangement status with clinical features. EGFR mutation was detected by DNA sequencing or ARMS. KRAS mutation and ALKrearrangement were tested by DNA sequencing and FISH respectively.  Results', ' Of 708 NSCLC patients, ROS1 rearrangements were detected in 11 cases (1.6%).There was no significant difference in age (P= 0.74), gender (P= 0.54), stage (I-IIIA vs. IIIB-IV P= 0.74), histology (adenocarcinoma vs non-adenocarcinoma, P= 0.99) or T status (T0-2 vs. T3-4, P= 0.23) between patients with ROS positive and negative NSCLC. Compared with the ROS1 negative group, patients with ROS1 rearrangements were more likely to be never-smokers (P= 0.04). Nine (81.8%) of the 11 ROS1 positive patients were adenocarcinomas and 6 of them with acinar or solid adenocarcinoma patterns, while 2 were large-cell and sarcomatoid carcinoma. The frequency of ROS1 rearrangements was 2.5% (6/243) among EGFR/KARS/ALK triple negative NSCLCs. Among 4 cases harboring concomitant ROS1 rearrangement and EGFR mutation, there were 3 with EGFR exon 19 deletion and 1 with exon 20 insertion. Both two patients with advanced NSCLC harboring concomitant ROS1 rearrangement and EGFRexon 19 deletion achieved partial response after first-line gefitinib treatment.  Conclusions', ' ROS1 rearrangement was identified in a small subgroup of NSCLC patients and predominantly existed in never-smokers.

        "Background":"[\"Genomic rearrangements that fuse kinase domain-containing 3 regions of tyrosine kinase genes with 5 regions of unrelated genes are well characterized in cancer. The resulting fusion proteins often drive proliferation and invasion of tumor cells and thus represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. One such kinase that has been demonstrated to be involved in various genomic rearrangement events in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), glioblastoma, and cholangiocarcinoma is the ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinase (also known as c-ROS and ROS). To date, three different 5 fusion partners for ROS1 have been identified. In this study, we examined the frequency of ROS1 gene rearrangement in a panel of 428 patient-derived NSCLC tumor samples using a break-apart FISH assay. We found that approximately 1.2% of samples were positive. In positive samples, the expression of the fusion gene and the identity of the fusion partner were examined. HCC78 is a NSCLC cell line that has been demonstrated by us and others to express the SLC34A2-ROS1 gene fusion. In order to assess the cellular consequences of ROS1 inhibition, we treated HCC78 cells with two distinct small molecule kinase inhibitors that have activity against ROS1 (crizotinib and TAE684). We found that both drugs inhibited proliferation of HCC78 cells, down-regulated signaling pathways known to control cellular growth and survival, and disrupted normal cell-cycle progression. Finally, we report clinical data from a NSCLC patient with a ROS1 gene rearrangement, as detected by the FISH break-apart assay, who demonstrated tumor shrinkage when treated with crizotinib. This patient's tumor exhibited a novel ROS1 gene fusion partner. In conclusion, genomic rearrangements involving the ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinase are present in a small subset of NSCLC patients, and drugs that target ROS1 may be an effective treatment strategy for these patients.\"]",

With attention to the direct connection between the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of tumor cells and the pharmacological effects of specific inhibitors, we systematically assessed the RTK expressions of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung (HGNEC), including SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC).Patients and Methods', 'Fifty-one LCNEC and 61 SCLC patients who underwent surgical resection were enrolled in this research. As a control group, 202 patients with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 122 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs) were also analyzed. Using immunohistochemical staining (IHC), we stained all tumors with antibodies for 10 RTKs; c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET and ROS1. We scored the expression of these RTKs for all enrolled tumors, and compared them according to the histological types.Results', 'The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. Especially, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20% of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.Conclusions', 'Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs. The exclusive c-Kit positivity observed among HGNECs suggested that c-Kit might be a distinctive RTK in HGNEC. These HGNECs which have strongly positive RTKs could be the targets of personalized therapies.']",

There are several examples where targeted inhibition of the resulting fusion produces dramatic clinical response. For example, the EML4-ALK fusion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Other ALK fusions have been described in NSCLC and other diseases including the NPM-ALK fusion in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). The efficacy of crizotinib and other ALK inhibitors are being investigated in these diseases. ALK is also subject to activation via mutation and sensitivity to crizotinib is reported in ALK mutation positive neuroblastoma. Finally, crizotinib has activity not only against ALK, but also against ROS1, MST1R and MET. ROS1 fusions have been found in NSCLC and glioblastoma, and MET amplification events in gastric adenocarcinoma identify additional settings that may benefit from crizotinib treatment.   Methods', '  To further understand the full therapeutic potential of Crizotinib, we undertook a genomic survey of ALK, ROS1, MET and MST1R across 1,000s of patients from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine.  Results', '  We confirmed the presence of EML4-ALK fusions in both lung and colorectal cancer (CRC), and also identified a novel ALK fusion in CRC. ALK hotspot mutations and focal amplifications were confined to neuroblastoma, as previously described. Our survey of ROS1 identified rare novel fusions in NSCLC and glioblastoma, and high-level amplifications in liposarcoma (2%) and rarely in breast cancer (0.2%). No fusions were identified for MET, however high-level amplifications were observed in 1-5% of papillary renal cell carcinoma, the intestinal subtype of gastric adenocarcinoma, oliogodendroglioma, glioblastoma and lung adenocarcinoma. Hotspot mutations were frequently observed in squamous head and neck (11%), and more rarely in hepatocellular carcinoma, small cell lung and ovarian cancers.

ROS1 rearrangements are found in only 1.2-1.7% NSCLCs, but seemingly only in triple negative (EGFR and KRAS non-mutated and ALK non-rearranged) adenocarcinomas and preferentially in non- or light smokers.  Methods', '  60 triple negative non- or light-smoking patients with lung adenocarcinoma were screened for ROS1 rearrangements by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Two commercially available break-apart FISH probe kits containing a mixture of two probes hybridizing on each side of the ROS1 locus, one located in a centromeric (3) position, and the other one in a telomeric (5) position relative to the ROS1 gene were used. ROS1 fusions were therefore detected without any preconception on the fusion partner, as multiple fusion partners have been described. At least 100 nuclei were screened, and a tumor was considered positive if it contained more than 15% rearranged nuclei.  Results', '  Forty-nine of the 60 tumors were interpretable. Four (8.2%) of theses 49 tumors were ROS1 rearranged by FISH. Only one of the positive cases showed a classical split rearrangement pattern (one fusion, one green and one red signal in more than 15% of nuclei), whereas the three other tumors showed a variant pattern, with a deletion of the telomeric probe, located in a 5 position relative to the ROS1 gene locus, indicating the presence of a fusion partner upstream of the ROS1 gene. The four positive cases were all at an advanced stage (3 or 4), but did not display any common architectural feature.  Conclusions', '  The prevalence of ROS1 positivity in our selected population was far superior (8.2%) to that of a non-selected NSCLC population, suggesting that this type of screening may be more effective (faster and more cost-worthy) to detect ROS1 positive tumors.']",

        "Background":"['Oncogenic mechanisms in SCLC remain poorly understood leaving this tumor with the worst prognosis among all lung cancers. Unlike other cancer types, traditional genomic approaches have been of limited success in SCLC. For instance, no patterns of prevalent mutations associated with SCLC progression or targeted therapeutics have emerged. Gene expression profiling based on differential expression have yielded potentially useful signatures in SCLC, but they have proven to be independent of each other and with minimal overlap, reducing translational potential. Nonetheless, since integrative systems biology studies of SCLC are warranted, we hypothesized that gene co-expression analyses can unveil key signaling hubs of specific networks that regulate SCLC proliferation and survival. We applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to a lung cancer patient gene expression dataset comprising of normal lung (NL), SCLC and Non-SCLC (NSCLC) such as squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, and identified hierarchical gene networks highly specific to SCLC. The hubs of these SCLC-specific networks formed a SCLC-specific hub network (SSHN) signature that', ' 1) classified SCLC from NSCLC and NL on 3 independent patient and 1 cell line datasets; 2) was validated in independent RNAseq and shotgun proteomic patient datasets; 3) identified 2 SCLC subtypes with high and low SSHN expression in patients and cell lines. Three top SSHN hubs, Fyn, Syk and BRCA1, are involved in oxidative stress (OSR) and DNA damage response (DDR), respectively. At the protein level, Fyn, Syk and BRCA1 were significantly co-expressed in tissue microarrays and classified SCLC patients into 2 subtypes', ' High and Low Fyn/Syk/BRCA1 (F/S/B). High F/S/B staining significantly correlated with longer recurrence-free survival of patients treated with standard chemotherapy, suggesting that efficient OSR and DDR may enhance chemo response. This possibility was tested in established SCLC cell lines, which also could be separated into high vs low F/S/B groups corresponding to the clinical subtypes. High F/S/B cell lines exhibited lower proliferative rates, suggesting that OSR and DDR may still exert influence over cell cycle. Syk knockdown in these cell lines caused significant reduction in cellular viability and proliferation, as well as increased levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Induction of oxidative stress in High F/S/B cell lines resulted in early activation of Fyn, Syk, p38, Erk and Akt. Thus, OSR may be overactive in SCLC and play a role in its natural history and response to treatment. In summary, our WGCNA combinatorial approach yielded novel insights into SCLC pathogenesis, separated two novel SCLC molecular subtypes with distinct functional OSR and DDR properties, and pointed to unsuspected potential therapeutic targets.']",

We have previously shown that Lkb1-deficiency triggered the lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) transition (AST) in mice through extracellular matrix remodeling, in which lysyl oxidase (LOX) plays an important role. Considering the high frequency of P53 mutations in human lung cancer, we reason it's attractive to test if LOX inhibition could modulate the lung cancer plasticity and subtype transition independent of LKB1 status.Methods\", ' KrasG12D/P53L/L (KP) mice were used to treat with BAPN or DPA,two LOX inhibitors, daily via intraperitoneal injection post 4 weeks of Adeno-Cre infection for 6-8 weeks and then harvested the lungs for pathological analyses. The histology and expression of related markers were analyzed by H&E, IHC staining, quantitative PCR and western blot. Results', ' BAPN/DPA treatment could result in a dramatic reduction of collagen deposition. We found no significant changes of total tumor number, but decreased average tumor size and tumor burden in treatment groups. Detailed pathological analyses showed that a few tumors from treatment group displayed typical squamous pathology, with the expression of squamous markers P63 and K14. In contrast, the tumors from control groups were adenomatous pathology and only expressing ADC markers TTF1 and SP-C. We further found that either BAPN or DPA treatment in KP mice promoted apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in ADC. Interestingly, we found the transited SCC showed almost no growth arrest and low apoptosis rate after BAPN or DPA treatment, indicative of the resistance to LOX inhibitors. ECM deprivation is a major cause of oxidative stress that contributes to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the deregulation of certain metabolic pathways. We then checked the level of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dGuo), a marker of DNA oxidative modification by ROS. In treatment groups, 8-oxo-dGuo was significantly lower in SCC than ADC. In our previous work done in KL model, we found that the ROS level was significantly up-regulated by LKB1 inactivation, which functionally modulated the AST. However, in KP mouse model, either LKB1 or p-AMPK level showed no significant change with or without BAPN/DPA treatment.Conclusions', ' These data demonstrated that pharmacological LOX inhibition could trigger the ADC to SCC transition independent of LKB1 status, highlight a non-cancer-cell autonomous role in phenotypic transition. Moreover, this lineage transition confers lung cancer with strong survival capability under environmental stress as well as the acquisition of drug resistance.']",

We performed immunohistochemistry on lung tumor biopsies and the result showed the expressions of shh, Gli1, VEGF-D and LYVE1 were enhanced in lymph node metastasis specimens compared to lymph node negative lung cancer specimens. We also investigated the role of shh signaling in the invasiveness and the motility of NSCLC. We found that Shh N-terminal peptide (N-shh) enhanced cell motility and invasiveness in NSCLC, and this process was inhibited by AAD-cyclopamine (SMO inhibitor). We observed that the mRNA expressions of shh, Gli1, VEGF-D and LYVE1 were enhanced by N-shh treatment, whereas no increase of these factors was observed when KAAD-Cyclopamine (a Shh signaling inhibitor) was treated together. In addition, we confirmed that Shh-induced lymphangiogenesis and motility/invasiveness of NSCLC are also reduced by LY294002, PI-3 Kinase/Akt inhibitor meaning that shh pathway and PI-3 Kinase/Akt are strongly related. Thus, we investigated the functional relationship between Shh and Akt signaling in the metastatic progression in NSCLC. Phosphorylation of Akt was enhanced by N-Shh, but regulated by KAAD-cyclopamine or LY294002. We further analyzed the effects of shh signaling in vitro by stimulating a HMVEC with N-shh and we observed N-shh enhanced the tube formation on matrigel, but the enhancement was inhibited upon cyclopamine or LY294002 treatment. The ROS production was increased in shh-overexpressing cells. These results indicate that shh signaling pathway can contribute to ROS generation enhancing the metastatic and lymphangiogenetic potential of tumor cells. Our findings suggest that Shh-Akt signaling processes through ROS and the activation of these pathway increases the metastatic potential of non-small cell lung cancer.']",

Different from non-small cell lung cancer, SCLC is characterized by a high proliferation rate and early metastasis. Only about 25% of patients with limited stage disease will be cured after first-line standard treatment and majority of the patients will relapse after initial sensitivity to the chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The highly complex genetic landscape of SCLC may be the reason for its resistance to conventional therapy but the details are still unclear. Methods', ' Nine patients with SCLC received platinum-based chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were included in this study. According to the prognosis, patients were classified into two groups', ' poor prognosis group (PP group, PFS < 6 months, n = 5) and better prognosis group (BP group, PFS > 24 months, n = 4). Tumor DNA was isolated from pre-treatment paraffin-embedded tumor tissue and subjected to enrichment for a 1.15M size panel cover exon regions from 1,086 genes. Followed by next generation sequencing on an Illumina X10 platform, the captured sequencing data was further processed using bioinformatics analysis to identify somatic mutations, including single nucleotide variants (SNV), short insertions/deletions (indels) and copy number variation (CNV). Changes in tumor DNA were compared with clinical efficiency. Results', ' We show that the tumor mutation burden in PP group is higher than the BP group (p = 0.06).

The compound was found to be a potent, ATP competitive inhibitor of ROS1 (IC50 7 nM). This biochemical potency translates into inhibition of the proliferation of HCC-78, a NSCLC cell line characterized by ROS1-driven activated signaling, due to the presence of the SCL34A2-ROS1 fusion gene. To further characterize the compound in cells, an activated form of ROS1 was expressed in Ba/F3 cells generating an IL3-independent, ROS1-driven tumor model. NMS-E628 strongly inhibits the proliferation of Ba/F3-ROS1 cells in vitro with confirmed dose-dependent decrease of ROS1 phosphorylation.

        "Background":"['Cisplatin resistance remains a clinical challenge for the treatment of lung cancer. We have previously shown that all cisplatin resistant (CR) cells tested have high ROS and low thioredoxin-1 (TRX1) protein. These biochemical changes lead to metabolic re-programming and hence these CR cells depend on fatty acid (FA) metabolism. To further confirm these finding, here we show a correlation between the levels of cisplatin resistance and ROS production, intracellular TRX1 levels and metabolic changes in tumor cells. We have established multiple CR clones with different levels of CR from small cell and non small cell lung cancer H69 and H460 (purchased from ATCC) and from cell lines derived from our lung cancer patients (SCLC1 and NSCLCS). These clones have different levels of cisplatin resistance ranging from 2, 5, to 10 fold. The stepwise increases in cisplatin resistance are correlated with a progressive increase in ROS production while intracellular TRX1 levels are gradually decreasing. Furthermore, CR cells which are highly resistant to cisplatin (2-3fold or more) with high ROS levels are hypersensitive to ROS inducing agent, elesclomol. Importantly, when ROS production increased by 5% or more, lung cancer cells become more sensitive to an agent that interferes with the FA synthesis pathway such as TOFA (an acetyl-coA carboxylase inhibitor) but resistant to glycolytic inhibitors. Thus, our data suggest that CR cells were no longer dependant on glycolysis, but instead are reliant on oxidative metabolism (OXMET). Since CR cells are sensitive to elesclomol, we have investigated whether combination of TOFA and elesclomol can increase cell death in CR cells. Our data showed that elesclomol alone at 5nM results in 35-40% cell death in 72hr. Interestingly, combination treatment with a non-toxic dose of TOFA (0.1g/ml) resulted in significant increase in cell death to 70%; (p<0.05). At a higher dose of elesclomol (10nM) which yield 50% cell death, combination with TOFA (0.1ug/ml) results in 95% cell death (p<0.05). Our findings strongly suggest that the levels of cisplatin resistance correlate with the levels of ROS production but inversely correlate with intracellular TRX1. When ROS production increases, these CR cells also become less addicted to glucose, but use FA as their energy source. Thus, by targeting ROS (elesclomol) and OXMET (TOFA), one can successfully kill CR cells without significant effect to normal cells (LL24, a lung fibroblast as control). Overall, these findings could have future implications for drug development to selectively target and eliminate CR tumors with a high ROS and low TRX1profile.

These processes include stem cell maintenance, determination of cell fate, tissue polarity, cell survival, cell differentiation and proliferation. Although this pathway is usually silenced in adult tissues, constitutive activation of the Hh pathway can lead to tumorigenesis. This aberrant characteristic can be observed in different types of human cancer including basal cell carcinomas, medulloblastoma, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, breast and prostate cancer. This pathway has been shown to regulate proliferation of cancer stem cells and increase tumor invasiveness. Targeted inhibition of Hh signaling pathway is shown to be effective in cancer treatment and prevention. Therefore, the discovery of Hh pathway inhibitors can pave the way of finding effective cancer treatments. The steroidal alkaloid cyclopamine was the first compound found to inhibit Hh signaling and has been invaluable for understanding the function of Hh signaling in development and cancer. Cyclopamine tartrate (CycT) is an improved analogue of cyclopamine with increased water solubility and bioavailabilty. We performed numerous experiments to examine the effect of CycT in inhibiting Hh signaling on an array of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lines. We discovered that CycT has a novel activity in disrupting mitochondrial function and aerobic respiration. Our data show that CycT causes a substantial decrease in aerobic respiration of NSCLC cells, similar to the effect of glutamine deprivation. Mitotracker staining showed that CycT causes mitochondrial fragmentation by increasing mitochondrial fission, which is indicated by the localization of DRP1 at fission sites. Further experiments showed that CycT increases ROS generation, which is presumably a consequence of mitochondrial hyperpolarization. Concomitantly, CycT causes apoptosis and suppress proliferation of NSCLC cells.']",

Cigarette smoke (CS) is the cause of 90% of lung cancer cases, and promotes drug resistance in lung cancer patients and is even known to limit effectiveness of treatment of cancers of other organs. It is therefore important to develop more effective strategies targeting CS-induced molecular abnormalities. Cigarette smoking increases oxidative stress particularly via activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX), a key source of superoxide anion production. Here we report the inhibitory effects of bioactive phytochemicals, grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs), on the migration potential of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (A549, H460 and H1299) and assessed whether CS-induced NOX activation is their target. Using an in vitro invasion assay, we found that treatment of NSCLC cells with CS condensate (CSC) increased the migration of NSCLC cells in a dose-dependent manner, via enhancing NOX mediated-reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Treatment of NSCLC cells with GSPs inhibited the cell migration via reduction in ROS accumulation or oxidative stress and subsequent reduction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. To examine the molecular targets of GSPs, we studied the effect of GSPs on CSC-induced alterations in the levels of key NOX components, namely, p22phox and p47phox, using A549 cells. We also determined the effect of GSPs on CSC-induced interaction between p22phox and p47phox proteins, a key event in NOX activation. Our results indicate that treatment of A549 cells with GSPs not only reverse CSC-induced expression levels of p22phox and p47phox, but also inhibit CSC-induced NOX activation by decreasing the binding of p22phox and p47phox proteins.

Moreover, resistance to chemotherapy is a major problem in cancer treatment. In an attempt to overcome drug resistance and improve treatment efficacy, new molecular targeted drugs are being developed and tested in clinical studies. Over the recent years various epidemiological studies have provided compelling evidence for the chemopreventive/therapeutic efficacies of various functional foods and natural products. We hypothesize that non-toxic natural compounds such as a native mixture of blueberry anthocyanidins (BB anthos) and withaferin A (WFA), alone and in combination with a suboptimal dose of the chemo drug paclitaxel (PAC) will have therapeutic response and also chemosensitize the lung cancer cells. We evaluated whether BB anthos could enhance the sensitivity of H1299 cells to PAC and reduce its effective dose to inhibit cell proliferation. Data show significantly enhanced cell death by PAC at a suboptimal concentration (1 nM) (IC50  40 nM) when combined with 5 M (25% vs. 5% inhibition) and 10 M (49% vs. 5% inhibition) BB anthos (1', '1 mixture of Dp, Cy, Mv, Pe and Pt). The significant inhibition of H1299 lung cancer xenografts in nude mice was also evident from the same combination, while no significant growth inhibition was observed with the individual entities. Since BB is a known antioxidant, we determined if BB anthos would attenuate oxidative stress-induced by PAC in H1299 lung cancer cells by measuring intracellular ROS production. Our data showed that addition of BB anthos (10 M each) did not affect the ROS levels produced by PAC (10 nM), as determined by cell permeable fluorescence probe DCFH-DA. Similarly, we also determined the antiproliferative potential of WFA alone and in combination with chemo drugs, PAC and docetaxel (DOC) against non-small-carcinoma lung cancer cells. WFA demonstrated high antiproliferative activity against the growth of both H1299 and A549 cells as determined by MTT assay. When suboptimal concentrations of WFA were tested in combination with suboptimal concentration of DOC and PAC, significantly enhanced antiproliferative activities were observed against H1299 and A549 compared with individual entities. The combination effect was found to be synergistic as analyzed using the CalcuSyn software. Together, our results suggest that both BB anthos and WFA enhanced therapeutic response of chemo drugs against lung cancer and reduce their required dose thus minimizing their toxicity.

        "Background":"['Approximately 7% of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) harbor oncogenic fusions involving ALK, ROS1, and RET. While tumors harboring ALK fusions are highly sensitive to crizotinib, emerging data have demonstrated that individuals with ROS1 or RET fusions may also benefit from inhibitors targeting these two kinases. A new oncogenic fusion involving NTRK1 that can be targeted by kinase inhibitors has been recently described. The two main methods to identify translocations, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) are labor intensive and sensitivity is rather low. Common sample types for lung cancer analysis are biopsies making the study of more than one fusion gene rather difficult. In this study we aimed to develop and validate a workflow based on AmpliSeq technology to comprehensively profile ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK1 chromosomal translocations in lung tumors. Two hundred lung cancer retrospective samples, including tumor biopsy, were collected from 12 laboratories - the OncoNetwork Consortium. All the samples were previously characterized by orthologous techniques (FISH, IHC, RT-PCR and/or MassArray). More than 30 ALK positive samples were selected. The panel targets over 70 fusion transcripts associated with ALK, RET, ROS1, and NTRK1 genes. The panel also includes 5 and 3 gene expression assays for each gene as indicators of a translocation event and assays for 5 internal control genes. The workflow is compatible with formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue, requiring only 10ng of total RNA and able to multiplex up to 16 libraries on a single Ion 318 chip. A dedicated data analysis pipeline using the Ion Reporter software 4.2 was evaluated. Serial dilutions of cell lines RNA harboring known fusion events, in normal RNA showed that the methodology had 1% mutant RNA limit of detection. A second dilution experiment using RNA extracted from FFPE lung fusion positive samples diluted in a negative FFPE sample showed a detection limit of 15%. The use of a common control fusion positive RNA samples among all the consortia laboratories showed 100% reproducibility. Concordance study was performed using 200 FFPE samples previously characterized with standard method. A concordance of >98% was obtained between the methodologies. The discordant results are currently under study. A negative FFPE samples was run as single test on an Ion 318 chip on to evaluate the possibility of false positive results due to high number of reads. No false positive was detected in this experiment. In this study we present a workflow that provides a robust, reproducible and accurate comprehensive genetic screening tool well suited for FFPE lung tumor biopsies, in a fast and cost-efficient manner. This may provide a valuable tool for reducing turn-around-time and expense in lung cancer analysis.']",

We hypothesized that CGP could also potentially identify a TOO for some CUP patients, further refining potential targeted therapeutic options. Methods', ' DNA alterations from 44,065 samples that underwent CGP as part of standard clinical care were classified using logistic regression based on mutational profiles and select clinical features. Results', ' We first trained a logistic regression classifier to identify non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) with alterations in EGFR, ERBB2, BRAF, MET, KRAS, ALK, RET, or ROS1 (lung gene set).

Gene fusions involving the tyrosine kinases ALK, ROS and RET are found in 5 - 10% of NSCLC patients and are considered as oncogenic drivers. However, the cellular signaling activated downstream of oncogenic fusions has not been systematically investigated and it remains unclear if different fusions induce specific targetable signaling patterns.In this study we have employed quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based phosphoproteomics to systematically characterize the signaling induced by oncogenic fusions frequently found in NSCLC. To this end, cDNA sequences of oncogenic fusions containing the tyrosine kinases ALK, ROS and RET and different fusion partners were constructed and ectopically expressed in HEK 293 and lung cancer cell lines. Subsequently, tyrosine phosphorylated peptides were enriched and identified by LC-MS. Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture was employed to precisely quantify the abundance of phosphorylation sites in cells expressing different oncogenic fusions.Our data demonstrate that all investigated oncogenic fusions induce massive tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins and lead to increased phosphorylation of the majority of all quantified phospho-tyrosine sites. For instance, we quantified 1300 unique phosphotyrosine sites from HEK 293 cells expressing EML4-ALK. Of those, 952 increased more than 4-fold in abundance. Comparative analyses of the signaling patterns allowed defining kinase-specific phosphorylation signatures. In addition, comparison of signaling patterns induced by different fusions permitted us to investigate the contribution of the non-kinase fusion partner to the downstream signaling. We were able to identify several phosphorylation events that were associated with specific non-kinase fusion partners. For example, kinase fusions containing the kinesin-1 heavy chain (KIF5B) specifically led to phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins, including cytoskeleton-associated protein 5 (CKAP5). We are currently investigating the functional role of these phosphorylation events for the oncogenic transformation.In summary, we demonstrate that MS-based phosphoproteomics is a powerful tool to investigate aberrant signaling induced by oncogenic fusions in non-small cell lung cancer. Importantly, we find that the kinases involved in the oncogenic fusions largely define the downstream signaling and that the investigated fusion partners only exhibited a minor effect on the downstream signaling.']",

Their stemness properties could be activated by stress-induced cell plasticity but the mechanisms remain to be studied. Calcium signaling is important for integrating cell responses to intra- and extracellular stresses. The role of its downstream pathway, calcineurin/NFAT, in lung TIC has not been explored. This study investigated the role and mechanisms of calcineurin/NFAT in regulating TIC and drug resistance by analyzing NFATc2 expression in multiple TIC populations and functional evaluation using in vitro and in vivo models. In tumor spheres and TIC isolated by marker-based flow cytometry, NFATc2 showed overexpression and higher luciferase reporter activities. Knockdown of NFATc2 reduced TIC marker proportions and suppressed TIC properties including pluripotency genes expression, sphere formation, cell mobility and drug resistance in vitro. Xenograft models and limiting dilution assay showed shNFATc2 effectively suppressed tumorigenesis and reduced TIC frequency. Stable NFATc2 knockdown sensitized tumors to cisplatin and gefitinib treatment. In contrast, TIC-supportive effects were observed in vitro and in vivo when NFATc2 was overexpressed. Further, NFATc2 was activated in stable gefitinib or cisplatin resistant cell lines, and knockdown of NFATc2 sensitized them to drug treatment. These data implicated NFATc2 is involved in lung TIC maintenance and drug resistance. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms of how NFATc2 mediate these roles, we analyzed pluripotency genes and observed a significant correlation between NFATc2 and SOX2 expression in lung cancer cell lines and human lung carcinomas. Computational analysis predicted NFATc2 binding sequences in SOX2 regulatory regions. Detailed studies including luciferase reporter assay, site-directed mutagenesis and CHIP-qRCR confirmed NFATc2 could regulate SOX2 expression through binding to its enhancer. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry on human lung cancers showed significant correlation between expressions of SOX2 and the anti-oxidative stem cell marker ALDH, suggesting SOX2 regulates ALDH expression. In vitro, NFATc2 knockdown suppressed ALDH1A1 expression but it was rescued by SOX2 overexpression. Vice versa, ALDH1A1 was upregulated in NFATc2 overexpressing cells but this was prevented by SOX2 knockdown. Functionally, reactive oxidative species (ROS) levels assessed by flow cytometry were suppressed by activated NFATc2/SOX2/ALDH1A1 axis, while treatment with the ROS inhibitor N-acetylcysteine reversed the sensitization of shNFATc2 on cisplatin treatment. Together, the data showed NFATc2 is involved in the regulation of TIC phenotypes in lung cancer. It increases drug resistance by ROS scavenging mediated by the SOX2/ALDH1A1 axis.']",

NSCLC are subdivided in clinically relevant molecular subsets according to a classification based on specific so-called oncogenic driver mutations.Recently, ROS1 gene rearrangement was identified in 1-2% of NSCLC resulting in the formation of fusion proteins in which the kinase domain of ROS1 is constitutively active. Targeting ROS1 proteins with crizotinib is showing promise as an effective therapy in ROS1-positive patients. The diagnostic test for ROS1 rearrangement is currently done on tumor biopsies or fine-needle aspirations. We evaluated whether ROS1 rearrangement could be detected and monitored using circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in ROS1-positive patients treated by crizotinib.

Experiments are ongoing to characterize the CIN status of CTCs using both FA-FISH and DNA image cytometry in ROS1-positive patients. Changes in the levels of ROS1-rearranged CTCs were observed during crizotinib treatment.ConclusionROS1 rearrangement can be detected in CTCs of patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC by using a filtration technique and FA-FISH combined with immunofluorescence staining, enabling both diagnostic testing and monitoring of crizotinib treatment. The high rate of cell-to-cell variability in ROS1 pattern abnormalities and tumor heterogeneity observed in ROS1-rearranged CTCs suggests that aneuploidy and genetic instability might have an important role in tumorigenesis of ROS1-positive NSCLC.']",

Concordance and correlative studies were done in MET-amplified, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens analyzed using a cMET IHC (SP44, 2+ or 3+ staining intensity in 50% or more tumor cell membrane) analyzing protein expression. Correlative studies involving co-existing aberrations, including PD-L1 (SP142, any intensity in at least 50% of tumor cells), in this MET-amplified, NSCLC cohort were also performed.MET amplification utilizing CISH was 0.7% (188/26,619) overall. MET-amplified solid tumors included carcinomas such as NSCLC (3.1%, 87/2767), gastric adenocarcinoma (3.8%, 11/293), esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (3.3%, 11/338), and endometrial carcinoma (0.4%, 9/2020) along with non-carcinomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (1.0%, 5/510), uterine sarcoma (1.3%, 5/400), melanoma (0.4%, 2/538), and rare tumors such as placental-site trophoblastic tumor (100%, 1/1) and prostatic neuroendocrine tumor (100%, 1/1). A sub-analysis of MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens demonstrated co-occurring protein overexpression in 92.6% (75/81) of cases. These same MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens were found to have EGFR pathogenic/presumed pathogenic mutations (19.7%, 15/76), ALK rearrangements (2.5%, 2/80), and PD-L1 overexpression (27.5%, 14/51). ROS1 rearrangements were not detected in this NSCLC cohort (0%, 0/76).Our data suggest MET amplification detection utilizing CISH is a viable option for identifying MET-driven cancers. The presence of MET across various solid tumors contrasts with biomarkers like HER2, which are exclusive to carcinomas. A sub-analysis of our NSCLC population shows MET-amplified tumors contains a similar molecular distribution to the general NSCLC population. Future studies should incorporate MET CISH in clinical trials utilizing MET-targeted agents to determine its potential as a predictive test for evaluating who may derive the most benefit.']",

Therefore, the development of new therapeutic strategies is essential for improving the prognosis and treatment of patients. An interesting experimental model to study human lung adenocarcinoma is represented by p53R172Hg/K-rasG12D mice. They develop aggressive NSCLC that metastasize to multiple sites and display a stepwise, directly age-related progression, mimicking several features observed in lung cancer patients. Lung cancer progression in p53R172Hg/K-rasG12D mice was characterized by non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. p53R172Hg/K-rasG12D mice develop lung adenocarcinomas already evident in 10 week-old mice, with a variable degree of differentiation. A significant gender difference in tumor progression was observed, with females developing more tumors than males. Moreover, by using qRT-PCR, some of the antigens deregulated in human lung cancer turned out to be up-regulated also during cancer progression in our mouse model, suggesting that p53R172Hg/K-rasG12D mice recapitulate the metastatic nature of human NSCLC. Identification of oncoantigens expressed during tumor development could provide an unprecedented opportunity to address the immune system against these molecules. RNA was extracted from lungs of 10, 20 and 30 week-old wild type (wt) and p53R172Hg/K-rasG12D mice. Transcription profiling was done using Mouse Exon 1.0 ST arrays', ' we detected 282 genes significantly differentially expressed during different stages of cancer progression. Interestingly, some of the genes that were already deregulated in the early phases of the tumor development remained deregulated also in advanced stages, suggesting their possible application as early biomarkers or as vaccination targets.

        "Background":"['Background Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer mortality world wide. The five-year survival rate of stage III and IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is poor with 16%. There is growing evidence that the immune system plays a paradoxical role in the development and progression of lung cancer. It influences tumor incidence, tumor growth, response to therapy, and the prognosis of the disease. Mouse models show that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a role in these processes. MDSCs are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells and myeloid progenitor cells, which are present in the tumor micro-environment and the peripheral circulation of cancer patients. These cells are able to suppress features of immune responses, like T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Aim In the present study we want to determine the role of pivotal immunological populations such as CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, and MDSCs. Methods Fresh blood of 60 stage IV non-squamous-NSCLC patients and 15 healthy controls (HC) was studied. Mononuclear cells were purified from peripheral blood by density gradient centrifugation and analysed by flowcytometry. MDSCs were characterized as CD11b, CD15 CD33 positive and low expression of HLA-DR and CD16 cells. Suppressive activity of MDSCs was measured by CD3-chain expression assays, and reactive-oxygen species (ROS) production using flowcytometry. Also T-cell proliferation assays were performed, in which sorted MDSCs were co-cultured with activated CD8-T-cells to investigate whether the MDSCs could inhibit the T-cell proliferation. Results All patients had a significantly increased MDSC population compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0009). Peripheral blood fractions possessed strong immunosuppressive functions, as shown by a high ROS production by MDSC, a decreased CD3-chain expression in T cells compared to HC. In addition, the CD8+ T-cells showed no proliferation when co-cultured with MDSCs, indicating that MDSCs could block CD8+ -T cell proliferation. The populations of CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells were significantly decreased in lung cancer patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.01 and p = 0.0024, respectively). Conclusion Circulating MDSCs are significantly increased, while CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells are significantly decreased in stage IV non-squamous-NSCLC patients compared to controls. MDSCs suppress the immune system by ROS production, down regulating the CD3-chain expression and thereby inhibiting T-cell proliferation. This suggests that MDSCs may play an important role in disease progression and overall survival. Therefore, further investigation is warranted.']",

        "Background":"['Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common type of lung cancer (comprising 80-85 %), is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. KRAS mutation is s major driver oncogene in NSCLC. Constitutive activation of K-Ras via oncogenic mutations plays a key role in development and progression of NSCLC, and is an important target for drug development. Indeed, drugs that target RAF-MAPK and PI3K, the well-established downstream pathways of K-Ras, are being evaluated in the clinic. However, to date, no effective treatments specifically targeting K-Ras have reached the clinic. A new direction for anti-Ras therapies targeting Ras-mediated altered cellular metabolism is implied by recent studies. Hence, as an attempt to investigate novel therapeutic targets to suppress KRAS-driven NSCLC, we assessed metabolic changes in NSCLC cell line and mouse model systems with oncogenic K-Ras mutations. We show that activation of Ras causes metabolic alterations, leading to aerobic glycolysis. Interestingly, despite the changes in the glycolytic pathway, NSCLC cell line and mouse models carrying K-Ras mutation revealed an elevated mitochondrial membrane potential, superoxide production as well as maximal oxygen consumption rate. Moreover, blockade of mitochondrial respiration effectively reduced mutant KRas-driven neoplastic phenotypes in NSCLC cell lines vitro and lung tumor formation in vivo. In contrast, blockade of glycolysis was not effective in the mutant KRas-driven tumorigenic activities. Mechanistically, mutant KRas-mediated activation of Akt2 led to increased expression of succinate dehydrogenase subunit A (SDHA) through increased protein stability by blocking proteasome-mediated degradation, resulting in mitochondrial complex II-dependent respiration. Our study suggests that induction of mitochondrial complex II-dependent respiration is an important mechanism by which oncogenic mutant KRas induces metabolic changes and ROS stress in NSCLC cells, contributing to lung carcinogenesis. Our findings elucidate potential metabolic targets that may provide novel therapeutic strategy for treating NSCLC with oncogenic KRAS mutations.']",

        "Background":"['Chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) are usually mediated by induction of apoptosis; this usually results in drug resistant during the therapy. Many compounds from natural resource have been shown to trigger autophagy in promoting cell death, and therefore which could be a novel treatment for cancer. Ginkgetin, a biflavonoid from Ginkgo biloba leaves (Ginkgoaceae), was shown its anticancer effects recently. The leaf of G. biloba is being recorded as a safe herbal drug in Pharmacopoeia from China and Europe. Here, the possible development of ginkgetin as an anticancer drug was demonstrated. Ginkgetin induced the death in A549 (NSCLC) with an IC50 lower than that of cisplatin. This anticancer effect of ginkgetin was also illustrated in NSCLC xenograft nude mice model. Transmission electronic microscope revealed that ginkgetin-induced autophagy was the main cause of cell death. Autophagy inhibitors, 3-methyladenine and chloroquine but not apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, rescued ginkgetin-induced cell death. Reciprocally, the induction of autophagy by rapamycin promoted ginkgetin-induced cell death, as well as the formation of p62-TRAF6-mTOR. During autophagy, p62 is hypothesized to be a target of ginkgetin-induced autophagic cell death. This notion is supported by several lines of evidence. The application of ginkgetin blocked fully the expression of p62 in cultured A549, and in contrast the over expression of p62 reduced ginkgetin-induced autophagy and cell death concomitantly with the decline on autophagosome formation. In parallel, the modulation on p62 expression could regulate Nrf2 activity and ROS level in the presence of ginkgetin. Thus, autophagy could act as an inducer in ginkgetin-induced cell death, and p62 was proposed to be a possible target during this process. Here, ginkgetin exhibited promising anticancer effect in NSCLC via autophagy, a signaling very different to orthodox chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin. Besides, ginkgetin is a phytochemical from G. biloba that is considered as a safe herbal supplement, and no obvious toxicity was observed in xenograft nude mice. Therefore, ginkgetin is proposed to be a potential compound for the development of novel anticancer drug.

        "Background":"['The use of kinase inhibitors directed at dominant oncogenes has proven a successful treatment strategy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring ALK gene fusions, but intrinsic or acquired drug resistance limits clinical benefit. We recently identified a novel class of oncogenes generated by translocations of the NTRK1 gene, which encodes the TRKA receptor tyrosine kinase. ROS1 and RET gene fusions represent additional oncogene targets in lung cancer and gene fusion positive tumors currently comprise 10% of lung adenocarcinomas. Previous results from our laboratory have demonstrated that EGFR signaling can mediate both intrinsic and acquired resistance in a ROS1+ NSCLC cell line. We asked whether EGFR might play a common role in other NSCLC cell lines harboring gene fusions with the aim of developing combination therapies that may delay drug resistance to oncogene-targeted kinase inhibitors in these tumors. We have observed high protein expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in NSCLC cell lines positive for ALK (H3122, H2228, and STE-1), ROS1 (HCC78 and CUTO-2), RET (LC-2/Ad), and NTRK1 gene fusions (CUTO-3), and in a NTRK1 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. We observed increased inhibition of downstream signaling and in vitro cellular proliferation with the addition of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in these gene fusion positive cell lines. Furthermore, stimulation of EGFR with EGF rescues targeted inhibition with oncogene-specific kinase inhibitors in the critical downstream signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK. Inhibition of cellular proliferation of these cell lines using oncogene-specific kinase inhibitors was also rescued by stimulation of EGFR. Interestingly, we observed transactivation of the TRKA and RET kinase domains by EGFR stimulation in the CUTO-3 and LC-2/Ad cell lines, respectively, despite treatment with a TRKA or RET kinase inhibitor. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that EGFR and the chimeric protein RIP-TRKA (encoded by the fusion gene MPRIP-NTRK1) associate in the CUTO-3 cells or when ectopically expressed in 293T cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate a critical role for EGFR in gene fusion positive lung cancer and suggest that signaling via this receptor may provide a survival mechanism for cancer cells treated with an oncogene-specific kinase inhibitor. Further investigation of EGFR inhibition in addition to oncogene-specific kinase inhibitors may be warranted.']",

Piperlongumine (PPLGM), a natural product of the plant Piper longum has shown potent anti-carcinogenic properties through an ROS-inducing mechanism.

Importantly, while thoracic XRT-alone reduced tumor burden by 48%, administration of PPLGM+XRT radiosensitized tumor and enhanced tumor killing by XRT, leading to a significant (p<0.05) 56% reduction in lung weight. Morphometric analysis of lung sections confirmed that PPLGM-alone significantly (p<0.01) reduced tumor area relative to vehicle, irrespective of radiation exposure. While exposure to XRT significantly (p<0.01) reduced tumor volume by 65% (from 44.4  7.6% to 15.4  4.5% tumor area), lung sections from mice exposed to PPLGM+XRT significantly (p<0.05) potentiated radiation-induced tumor eradication (reduction in tumor area to 5.6  3.0%) above XRT-only exposure. Furthermore, PPLGM significantly (p<0.05) radiosensitized LLC dose-dependently to gamma-radiation killing, while trending towards radioprotecting normal lung cells.

The average throughput uniquely mapped to the human genome reference was 10Gbp per sample. Differentially expressed genes showed higher expression in HOX families, FOXL2, SOX2, FGFR3, JAK3, and ALK. In contrast, WIF1, RSPO2, ROS1, TAL1, PRDM16 was down regulated in tumor cells. To subgroup patients with their driver mutation, somatic mutation have been detected with comparison to normal paired samples, filtering with MAF<0.01 of Northeast Asian Population, 1KG, and ExAC 65000 exomes. The average number of nonsynonymous somatic mutation was 49.63 per sample. Sixty-seven patients had somatic mutation in TP53, CDKN2A, NFE2L2, and PIK3CA.

        "Background":"['NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), negatively regulated by KEAP1, modulates induction of a battery of cytoprotective genes against oxidative stress via binding to the antioxidant responsive element (ARE) sequence. Recent NGS studies have shown a significant number of mutations in the KEAP1-NRF2-ARE signaling pathway, implicating aberrant activation of this pathway in lung cancer carcinogenesis and chemoresistance. The SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, employing eitherBRG1 or BRM as a catalytic subunit, regulates gene expression and alters chromatin structures in an ATP-dependent manner. Loss of complex function often occurs in lung cancers, via mutations in complex subunits. Since KEAP1/NRF2 mutations and BRG1/BRM loss occur frequently in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) in a mutually exclusive fashion, we hypothesized that BRG1 and/or BRM play(s) a role in the regulation of NRF2 target genes. To test this hypothesis, we developed a series of isogenic H358 NSCLC lines with reduced BRG1 and/or BRM expression using shRNA technology. We observed a significant increase in the levels of HMOX1 (heme oxygenase1) and GSTM4 (GlutathioneS-transferase Mu 4) with a concomitant decrease in NQO1 (NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1) in the BRG1-deficient H358 cell lines. However, GCLM (Glutamatecysteine ligase regulatory subunit) was elevated only in the BRM-reduced H358 cells. Interestingly, BRG1 loss, either alone or combined with BRM loss, promoted SDS-resistant KEAP1 dimerization. We are currently examining whether BRG1 and/or BRM loss increases ROS levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed that NRF2 were enriched at NRF2 downstream genes in both H358 parental and vector control cells, whereas BRG1 knockdown led to a moderate increase (HMOX1) or decrease (NQO1) in NRF2 binding. These results provide evidence that loss ofSWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex activity alters the NRF2 pathway in NSCLC.Furthermore, novel drugs targeting NRF2 downstream genes might provide a therapeutic approach for BRG1 deficient NSCLC patients.']",

Many of these alleles appear more relevant to a particularly histological type of lung cancer.With the aim of identifying novel lung cancer susceptibility loci, The Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung (TRICL), the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO) and Lung Cancer Cohort Consortium (LC3) have undertaken a very large collaborative GWAS across 29 lung cancer studies, including analysis of the predominant lung cancer histological subtypes.MethodsIn collaboration with the Center for Disease Research (CIDR), TRICL, ILCCO and LC3 have genotyped 18,000 case-control pairs on the GAME-On Oncoarray. SNP imputation was undertaken using the 1,000 Genomes v3 reference panel, followed by logistic regression of each genetic variant with lung cancer and considering ancestry inferred by genetic profile to correct for cryptic population structure. The OncoArray and our previous GWAS results were combined using meta-analysis. This allowed for a GWAS of 10,155,682 SNPs for 25,655 lung cancer cases and 52,451 controls, as well as histology specific analysis of 6,629 squamous cell and 9,817 adenocarcinomas. Alternate genotyping techniques (Affymetrix, Taqman) were used to confirm the fidelity of the genotyping for variants of interest.ResultsWe have identified common genetic variants exceeding genome wide significance (p<510-8) at eleven novel susceptibility loci. This included two associated with overall lung cancer (1p31, 19q13), eight with lung adenocarcinomas (3q28, 6p25, 8p12, 9p21, 10q25, 11q23, 15q21, 20q13) and one with squamous-cell lung carcinomas (10q24). These genetic variants are located near several intriguing candidate genes, such as telomere function genes (OBFC1, RTEL1), nicotine metabolism genes (CYP2A6), genes somatically mutated in lung cancer (NRG1) and genetic susceptibility loci linked to other cancers (IRF4, CDNK2A). In additional, we noted several borderline (p<10-6) associations with common variants located near nicotine addiction genes (CHRNB2, CHRNA2, CHRNA4, DBH) and other genes somatically translocated in lung cancer (ROS1). Integration of eQTL databases suggests that many of the associated genetic variants influence gene expression levels of these candidate genes.ConclusionWe have identified eleven novel lung cancer susceptibility loci, doubling the number implicated by GWAS. These genetic variants were common (MAF 0.05-0.49) with modest to small genetic effects (OR's 1.10-1.17). Further expansion of GWAS efforts, particularly within histological subtypes of lung cancer, is likely to identify additional susceptibility loci and further increase our understanding of lung cancer aetiology.\"]",

SAHA inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells, and induced a G2/M phase arrest and apoptotic cell death in these cancer cells. In contrast, SAHA did not significantly inhibit the growth of normal lung cells and induce apoptotic cell death. Concerning the oxidative stress, SAHA increased ROS levels in lung cancer cells and induced glutathione (GSH) depletion. Moreover, it decreased the expression level of Trx1 in lung cancer cells. While the overexpression of Trx1 attenuated death and GSH depletion in SAHA-treated lung cancer cells, the downregulation of Trx1 intensified those in these cells. In addition, SAHA increased miR-629 level in lung cancer cells. The mRNA level of Trx1 was decreased by SAHA. Furthermore, the 3 UTR region of Trx1 was regulated by miR-629.

Promising clinical responses have been observed in patients bearing tumors with ROS1 fusions treated with Xalkori, an ALK/MET kinase inhibitor that also inhibits Ros1. However, resistance has been observed and a ROS1 kinase domain mutation, G2032R, was identified in a ROS1 fusion positive NSCLC patient who developed resistance to Xalkori treatment. Clinical experience with other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors suggests that additional resistance mutations are likely to arise, highlighting the need for therapeutic agents that can overcome this type of resistance.We identified a novel chemical series of potent and selective Ros1 inhibitors with a unique DFG-out binding mode. The structure of human Ros1 in a complex with a ligand from this chemical class was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Here we describe the structure-activity relationships and synthesis route for this chemical series. A representative compound from this series inhibited isolated recombinant Ros1 kinase activity with an IC50 of approximately 30 nM.

Growth of Ba/F3 cells engineered to express Ros1 autophosphorylation in HCC78 NSCLC cells that harbor a SLC34A2-ROS1 fusion were inhibited at similar concentrations as the isolated protein.

This compound was also active on Ba/F3 cells containing Ros1 with a mutation in the gatekeeper residue, L2026M, in cell growth assays in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, this unique binding mode provides scope for activity on additional Ros1 mutations that confer resistance to Xalkori, such as the clinically relevant G2032R mutation.

We investigated the metabolic response and mitochondrial function of LKB1-deficient NSCLC cells treated with erlotinib. LKB1-deficient cells exhibited enhanced sensitivity to erlotinib treatment in vitro and in vivo despite having wild-type EGFR. We found that this enhanced response was due to altered energetic metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in LKB1-deficient cells, which prevents homestatic maintenance of ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in response to erlotinib treatment. Despite negative regulation of mTOR activity by LKB1-AMPK signaling, erlotinib effectively blocked mTOR signaling in LKB1-deficient cells, resulting in inhibition of cell growth, as well as activation of apoptosis.

And molecular targeting therapies for lung adenocarcinoma, targeting mutant EGFR or ALK, RET and ROS1 fusions, limit non-tumor toxicity and extend survival time compared to the conventional chemotherapies.

NCCN guideline lists multiple drugs which are particularly effective in the subgroup of patients with specific gene mutation variants, including the fusion transcripts of ALK, ROS1 and RET, and the mutations of EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and HER2. Multiple techniques have been developed to detect fusion transcripts in tumor samples, such as FISH, IHC and PCR assays. FISH is the most accurate method for fusion detection currently. The split probe FISH assay, which does not require the pre-knowledge of what is the fusion partner with ALK for example, can detect unknown ALK fusion products as well. However, it fails to identify which gene is fused with ALK (or other oncogene) in the chimera products, therefore is not informative for the mechanism or drug resistance study. In addition, due to the limitation on the fluoresce dye, it is quite difficult to multiplex fusion FISH probes for different genes into one assay.We describe here a next generation sequencing assay to detect a panel of fusion transcripts and mutations in one single assay. Our single assay can detect the fusion products of ALK, ROS1 and RET with any known or unknown fusion partners, together with the hotspot mutations in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and HER2. Our assay can identify not only the exact sequence of the unknown fusion partners, but also any mutations within the full coding regions of ALK, ROS1 and RET. This information is critical for the resistance mechanism study and the next generation inhibitor drug development, since about half of the ALK inhibitor resistance was caused by the mutations in ALK gene itself. We have identified a novel ALK fusion gene with a never-reported fusion partner in a lung cancer patient.

On treating HL-60 cells with 5M JS-K formulated in DMSO (JS-K) or P123/JS-K for 4-8 hours, activation of both GRP-78 and CHOP (markers of ER stress) was observed using western blot analysis. ER stress could also be triggered by phosphorylation of JNK protein. Again, using western blot analysis, JNK phosphorylation was observed when HL60 cells were treated with JS-K or P123/JS-K for 4-6 hours. Oxidative stress was studied by quantifying intracellular levels of reactive oxygen/reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) using the ROS/RNS sensitive fluorophore 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2-7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 5M of JS-K or P123/JS-K for 30, 60 or 120 minutes lead to increased levels of ROS/RNS.These experiments show that JS-K activates the intrinsic component of cell death by producing ER stress and oxidative stress. JS-K is at an advanced stage of pre-clinical development. Its novel and multiple mechanisms of action make it an attractive therapy for the treatment of AML and other malignancies.']",

We examined the efficacy and safety of crizotinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of MET, ALK and ROS, in patients with advanced, ROS1-rearranged NSCLC.  Methods', '  Patients with advanced NSCLC harboring ROS1 rearrangement, as determined using a break-apart FISH assay, were recruited into an expansion cohort of a phase 1 study of crizotinib. Patients were treated with crizotinib at the standard oral dose of 250 mg BID. The objective response rate (ORR) was determined based on RECIST 1.0. The disease control rate (DCR; stable disease [SD] + partial response [PR] + complete response [CR]) was evaluated at 8 weeks.  Results', '  Thirteen patients within the ROS expansion cohort received crizotinib and all were evaluable for response. The median age was 47 yrs (range 3172), and all but one of the patients were never-smokers. All patients had adenocarcinoma histology.  12/13 patients were tested for ALK rearrangement and all were negative. The median number of prior treatments was 1 (range 03). To date, the ORR is 54% (7/13), with 6 PRs and 1 CR, with 6 responses achieved by the first restaging scan at 78 wks. There was 1 additional unconfirmed PR at the time of data cut-off. The DCR at 8 wks was 85% (11/13). Median duration of treatment was 20 wks (range 4+59+). All responses are ongoing, and 12 patients continue on study.

The pharmacokinetics and safety profile of crizotinib in this group of patients were similar to that observed in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC.  Conclusions', '  Crizotinib demonstrates marked antitumor activity in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring ROS1 rearrangements.

        "Background":"['Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKi) have greatly improved the treatment and prognosis of multiple cancer types. However, unexpected cardiotoxicity has arisen that was not wholly predicted by current FDA mandated pre-clinical tests. Thus a more robust tool to predict the cardiotoxic potential of these compounds is warranted. For this purpose, we developed a panel of in vitro tests in a clinically relevant human cardiomyocyte model that assesses drug impact on overall cardiac health (cell viability, apoptosis, and morphology), mitochondria and metabolic intactness (reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, AMPK activity, and lipid accumulation), and electrophysiological function (impedance (beat rate) and ion channel blockage). To demonstrate the utility of our panel, we examined the effect of 4 FDA-approved TKi with known clinical outcome on cardiac health. The 3 drugs with known cardiac adverse events (crizotinib, sunitinib, and nilotinib) all proved to be cardiotoxic by our panel although each showed distinct mechanisms of toxicity. However erlotinib, a cardiac-safe drug that targets EGFR and is used primarily in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), did not show any indications of toxicity. Surprisingly, the most cardiotoxic drug by our panel was crizotinib, an ALK/ MET inhibitor that has revolutionized treatment for ALK+ NSCLC patients. Crizotinib potently impaired overall cardiac health by increasing ROS and apoptosis but also impeded electrophysiological function by inducing ion channel blockage and reducing cardiac beat rate. Interestingly crizotinib also induced lipid and cholesterol accumulation which was shown to be correlated with increased expression of the sterol-regulatory binding protein (SREBP) pathway by transcriptome analysis. The multi-targeted TKi sunitinib (used in renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors) and nilotinib (used in chronic myelogenous leukemia) also showed unique cardiotoxicity profiles. In conclusion, our studies showed a distinct cardiotoxicity profile for each TKi that correlates with clinical outcome. These results suggest that caution should be taken with these TKi especially when used long-term or in the adjuvant setting. Furthermore, these effects may be exacerbated in patients with adverse cardiac genetic predispositions and studies are ongoing in our lab on patient-derived cardiac cell lines to investigate this possibility. This multi-parameter screening approach allows for a more complete assessment of the potential for drug-induced cardiotoxicity and may allow for earlier detection in the drug development process. In addition, understanding the mechanisms of cardiac toxicities may lead to the discovery of novel mitigation strategies and combination therapies to improve cardiac cell health during treatment with oncology therapies.']",

Although the role of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) in cell survival signaling is well documented, whether RIP1 is directly involved in cancer development has never been studied. In this report, we found that RIP1 expression is substantially increased in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and cell lines. RIP1 expression in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) was significantly induced by cigarette smoke extract (CSE) or benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), the active form of the tobacco-specific carcinogen benzo (a) pyrene (BaP). In RIP1 knockdown HBECs, BPDE-induced cytotoxicity was significantly increased, which was associated with induction of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mainly hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including JNK, ERK and p38. Scavenging ROS suppressed BPDE-induced MAPK activation and inhibiting ROS or MAPKs substantially blocked BPDE-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting ROS-mediated MAPK activation is involved in BPDE-induced cell death. The H2O2-reducing enzyme catalase is destabilized in an ERK- and JNK-dependent manner in RIP1 knockdown HBECs and application of catalase effectively blocked BPDE-induced H2O2 accumulation and cytotoxicity. Importantly, BPDE-induced transformation of HBECs was significantly reduced when RIP1 expression was suppressed. Altogether, these results strongly suggest an oncogenic role for RIP1, which promotes malignant transformation through protecting DNA-damaged cells against carcinogen-induced cytotoxicity associated with excessive ROS production.']",

Crizotinib, ALK/ROS1/cMET tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), showed high effect against ROS1-rearranged NSCLC in the clinical trials and is approved in US and EU. However, the cancers inevitably relapse due to the acquired resistance such as ROS1-G2032R mutation. We previously reported that cabozantinib could overcome those secondary mutations mediated crizotinib-resistance. Based on this finding, we tried to establish cabozantinib-resistant ROS1 mutant cells by ENU mutagenesis screening. Surprisingly, we found out a few CD74-ROS1 mutant clones that only grew in the presence of low-dose cabozantinib. Namely, these mutant clones were “addicted” to cabozantinib. When the fluorescent labeled cabozantinib addicted ROS1 mutant cells were co-cultured with non-addicted CD74-ROS1-WT-BaF3 cell in the presence or absence of low-dose cabozantinib, the drug-addicted cells became dominant in the low-dose cabozantinib, and CD74-ROS1-WT cells became dominant in the absence of it. To analyze the molecular mechanism of “drug-addiction” in the addicted CD74-ROS1 mutant cells, we performed comprehensive analysis such as inhibitor screening, cDNA microarray, and phosphoproteome analysis. As the result, we observed that the expression and phosphorylation of CD74-ROS1 in the addicted cells were excessively upregulated within 24 hours after removal of cabozantinib or other ROS1 inhibitors, such as crizotinib or lorlatinib. We also observed that the apoptosis was induced in these cells upon ROS1 inhibitor removal, whereas ROS1 mediated growth signaling were simultaneously activated. Consistent with this, cDNA microarray analysis revealed that the expression of both cell survival and cell death related genes were changed by ROS1 inhibitor removal. Furthermore, we identified that several proteins were highly phosphorylated by excessive ROS1 activation originated from ROS1 inhibitor removal. These observations suggest that these drug-addicted cells were died by excessive oncogenic signaling, and the appropriate oncogene signaling by low-dose TKI made them survive and grow without inducing apoptosis. Thus, the excessive oncogene signaling has “double-edged sword” characteristics for cancer cell viability and those characteristics could be a new therapeutic target.']",

The unsatisfactory outcomes of lung cancer treatment are related to multiple factors including tumor recrudescence, metastasis, cancer drug resistance, etc. Cancer stem cells are cell subsets within a cancer that excel in tumor properties, especially survival, renewal and resistance to treatment. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are high energy molecules produced during cellular hyperproliferation and cell death. Studies have shown though a low level of ROS is required to support stem cell functions but excessive ROS damages DNA and predisposes to cell death. Therefore, the ability to attenuate oxidative damage from ROS and maintain redox homeostasis is an important property of aggressive and resilient cancer cells. The multifunctional serine/threonine kinase calcium/calmodulin- dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMK2A) is a calcium signaling molecule involved in cell growth and stress signals integration. It has been reported to play a tumor-supportive role in osteosarcoma, prostate cancer and leukemia. However, little is known about the impact and mechanisms of CaMK2A on lung cancer and cancer redox homeostasis. This study aims to investigate the role of CaMK2A in ROS regulation in lung cancer stem cells. We measured ROS levels using H2DCFDA probes in cancer stem cells isolated from two lung cancer cell lines by the known lung cancer stem cell marker CD44 and CD166. Compared to CD44- and CD166- non-stem cells, ROS levels were lower in both CD44+ and CD166+ cancer stem cells. In cancer cells with stable CaMK2A knockdown by shRNA (CaMK2A-KD), ROS was suppressed while CaMK2A overexpression led to ROS elevation, suggesting a potential role of CaMK2A on ROS regulation in lung cancer stem cells. To understand the mechanism, activated NRF2 levels, the master transcription factor mediating ROS regulation, were measured in total nuclear protein extracts. By Western blot, nuclear NRF2 protein showed upregulation in CaMK2A overexpression cells and decreased levels in CaMK2A-KD cells, implying NRF2 might be a mediator of CaMK2A in ROS regulation. To further identify downstream regulators, mRNA expression analysis of five ROS-regulatory NRF2 target genes (GSTP1, NQO1, GCLC, HMOX1, TRXR1) was performed. Quantitative PCR results showed significant corresponding changes of some these gene expressions in cell lines, which upregulated in CaMK2A overexpression and downregulated in both CaMK2A-KD cells and CaMK2A pharmacological inhibition cells. Together, the results indicate CaMK2A might regulate ROS status through mediating downstream target genes of NRF2.']",

Certain NSCLC cell lines/tumor samples also express very low levels of ASS; however, it is unclear how this expression will be affected by cisplatin treatment. In this report, we investigate the underlying mechanism using 6 pairs of NSCLC cell lines and their CR variants', ' H460/H460CR, F/FCR, S/SCR, A549/A549CR, H1299/H1299CR, and H23/H23CR. Note that H460, F, S are ASS(+) and A549, H1299, H23 are ASS(-). No ASS expression due to hypermethylation was found in H1299, while in A549 and H23, it is most likely due to transcription regulation which governs ASS expression, as we have been previously reported in melanoma. All these CR cells possess at least 7 fold resistances to cisplatin and express 3-5 fold increase in ROS levels when compared to parental cell counterparts. CR cells, derived from parental cells that possess high ASS expression, exhibited significantly lower levels of ASS once they became resistant to cisplatin. These CR cells were also hypersensitive to arginine deprivation using ADI-PEG20 (provided by Polaris Inc) which degrades arginine to citrulline. Importantly, the addition of 50ng/ml of ADI-PEG20 restored cisplatin sensitivity to CR cells. With the combination of cisplatin and ADI-PEG20, the ID50 dosage of cisplatin decreased (5-7 fold) to the original levels as their parental counterparts. When compared with cisplatin alone treatment, the percentage of cells with caspase activation increased from 5% (2ug/ml of cisplatin) to 70% (combination with ADI-PEG20). However, in three pairs of CR cells derived from ASS(-) cells, the ASS remains negative in H1299CR while in A549CR and H23CR the ASS expression showed 1-1.5 fold increase both at mRNA and protein levels. Nevertheless, the addition of ADI-PEG20 still can sensitize these CR cells to cisplatin treatment. To further verify the role of ASS in cisplatin resistance, we have overexpressed ASS into SCR cell line and determine the sensitivity to cisplatin. This transfectant became resistant to ADI-PEG20, but maintains similar levels of cisplatin resistance. These data suggest that silencing ASS in these CR cells is most likely a consequence of other biochemical changes occurring in CR cells. These metabolic alterations can be used to target CR lung cancer. Supported by Department of Veterans Affairs, CDA2 award (1K2BX001289).']",

Results', ' As of December 2016, 133 institutions were participating and 295 patients had been enrolled. The median age was 69 years (range, 14-90 years). Two hundred seventeen (74%) were male and most patients (93%) were smokers. Among 268 samples completed analysis, we identified high prevalence of inactivating TP53/RB1 mutations in 198 (74%) /82 (31) of cases, respectively. MYC/MYCL1/MYCN amplifications were detected in 10 (4%) /13 (5) /4 (1) of cases, respectively. The NGS analysis also showed that 62 (23%) of cases had at least one targetable genomic alterations, including 7 EGFR activating mutations (3%), 6 KRAS activating mutations (2%), and 8 FGFR1 copy number gains (3%). No case was positive for ALK or ROS1 fusions. Never-smokers (71% vs. 5%, p<0.001) were significantly frequent in the EGFR type compared to the others. The KRAS type showed significantly poor progression free survival (PFS) of the first-line chemotherapy compared to the others (median PFS 1.2 vs. 6.1 months, respectively; p<0.001).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with ALK and ROS1 rearrangements, the emergence of mutations in the targeted oncogenes was identified as one of the mechanisms that confer drug resistance. In particular, a group of mutations known as solvent front mutations, such as ALKG1202R and ROS1G2032R, render common resistance to ALK and ROS1 inhibitors. Similar solvent front mutations, such as TRKAG595R and TRKCG623R, have also been identified in cancer patients with rearrangement of NTRK family genes who developed resistance to TRK-targeted therapies. TPX-0005, a compact three-dimensional macrocyclic molecule, was designed to completely locate at the adenine binding site of ATP in order to efficiently target the active kinase conformation and systematically circumvent the steric interference from various clinical resistant mutations, especially the solvent front mutations. TPX-0005 is an orally available and potent ATP-competitive inhibitor against ALK, ROS1, TRKA, TRKB and TRKC recombinant kinases and their corresponding clinical resistant mutants. TPX-0005 demonstrated potent anti-proliferative activity in the range of sub-nanomolar to low nanomolar in a number of human cancer cell lines and engineered stable cell lines expressing the targeted oncogenes or their solvent front mutants, accompanied by inhibition of target phosphorylation and concomitant inactivation of downstream effectors such as ERK, AKT and STAT3. In patient derived xenograft tumor models, TPX-0005 treatment resulted in significant regression of tumors harboring the oncogenic ALK, ROS1 and TRKC fusions. Moreover, in a series of mouse xenograft tumor models, TPX-0005 exhibited marked anti-tumor activity not only in tumors harboring the wildtype oncogenic targets but also in tumors harboring the oncogenes with the solvent front mutations via inhibition of the target phosphorylation. Taken together, these pre-clinical studies have demonstrated the potent activities of TPX-0005 against not only wild type oncogenic ALK, ROS1, TRK fusions but also their corresponding solvent front mutations, which will bring in a new therapy for cancer patients resistant to currently available ALK, ROS1, and TRK inhibitors in clinic.']",

Here, we report rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR) amplification as a novel genetic abnormality in a young patient with non-small cell lung cancer. This male patient was a never smoker and was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinorma at the age of 18. He initially presented with refractory cough and persistent left lung lesions. Pathology was consistent with lung adenocarcinorma, poorly differentiated. Extensive molecular testing was negative for common genetic alterations in K-RAS, EGFR, ALK, HER2, RET, AKT, PIK3CA, BRAF and ROS1. His tumor was subsequently subjected to next generation DNA sequencing (FoundationOne, Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA) targeting a cohort of more than 180 cancer-related genes. This analysis identified rictor amplification of at least 6 copies as the sole DNA abnormality. Immunohistochemistry further documented rictor overexpression in the patient's lung tumor. The neoplastic lung tissue exhibited diffuse and strong cytoplasmic staining for rictor, compared to surrounding non-neoplastic tissues. Furthermore, the tumor tissue showed diffuse overexpression of phospho-S473 Akt, an essential downstream target of rictor.Rictor is a key component of mTORC2 complex, where it modifies actin cytoskeleton organization, cell proliferation and survival. Activation of rictor signaling has been suggested to play critical roles in regulating cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis in breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers and gliomas. To our knowledge, this is the first report of rictor amplification in lung cancer. Moreover, we found that blockade of the rictor-mTORC2 pathway by siRNA-mediated rictor knockdown or with pharmacological inhibitors led to decreased phosphorylation of S473-AKT and growth inhibition in lung cancer cell lines. Thus, rictor amplification may represent a potential novel target in lung cancer. We will perform further studies to determine whether rictor amplification is a unique molecular subtype of lung cancer. Further, we hope to identify which targeted drugs are active against tumors with rictor amplification and overexpression.\"]",

        "Background":"['Genotype-directed targeted therapies are transforming the care of advanced cancer. However, having adequate tumor tissue for comprehensive genotyping remains a challenge for many patients. We recently reported on a new assay for noninvasive plasma genotyping using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) of cell free DNA (cfDNA) (Oxnard et al., CCR, 2014). While appealing in its simplicity, ddPCR assays cannot detect complex genomic alterations such as chromosomal rearrangements and cannot be massively multiplexed; a key requirement for efficiently testing for the increasing number of rare but targetable genomic alterations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Here we report on a novel, targeted, bias-corrected, and quantitative Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) solution for analyses of cfDNA. Our plasma NGS assay is focused on targetable driver mutations and rearrangements in lung cancer targeting 23 exons, 9 introns covering 17kb for 10 driver genes. Rather than using traditional hybrid capture, our assay integrates efficient fragment cloning, guided target retrieval, and molecular annotation of library sequences, which reduces off-target reads and improves signal-to-noise ratio. Performance of this assay panel was optimized in two iterations of probe design using targeted sequencing results of fifteen annotated NSCLC-derived cell lines. We were able to detect hotspot base changes and indels with 100% sensitivity and specificity at mutant allele frequencies of 1% and with 92.3% specificity at allele frequencies less than 0.1%. An automated pipeline for mutation calling correctly identified rare alleles with a sensitivity and specificity for point mutations and indels of >90% at allele frequencies of 0.2%. We then piloted the technology using cfDNA from a patient with newly diagnosed advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC and two NSCLC patients with micro-duplication/insertions in Her2neu. Blinded to the true tumor sequences, our NGS platform detected the correct ALK rearrangement (EML4-ALK v2) in 2 separate reads as well as the correct Her2neu insertions (2311-2322dup and 2332-2340 dup) in circulating DNA. We further show clinical translation to plasma from a cohort of 20 lung cancer patients that harbored rare driver genetic events, including ALK, ROS1 and RET rearrangements by tissue sequencing.We are the first to sequence chromosomal rearrangements in plasma without prior knowledge of tissue genotyping results.

        "Background":"['ME-344, a second-generation derivative of a natural product isoflavone is being developed as a clinical candidate in small cell lung and ovarian cancer by MEI Pharma (San Diego, CA). Treatment of tumor cells in culture with low micromolar ME-344 decreased mitochondrial ATP production and increased ROS, with subsequent disruption of mitochondrial integrity. To gain further insight into this unusual mechanism of action, we compared ME-344 activity in sensitive and naturally resistant lung cancer cell lines, together with primary human lung embryonic fibroblasts (HLEF). Using SeaHorse technology we measured the impact of ME-344 on oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) in these cells under conditions of mitochondrial and glycolytic stress. In a dose dependent manner, the drug caused instantaneous and pronounced inhibition of OCR in drug-sensitive lung cancer cells; significantly less in drug-resistant cells. These results are consistent with targeting of mitochondria by ME-344 with specific effects to the respiratory chain (drug resistance correlated with higher glycolytic indexes in these cells.) Inhibition of OCR did not occur in primary HLEF. ME-344 increased ECAR in drug-resistant lung cancer cells, where this effect was significantly diminished in drug-sensitive cells. Such data suggest that ME-344 specifically targets mitochondrial proton channels (pumps). Only in drug sensitive cells, ME-344 dose-dependently increased the intracellular generation of ROS (detected by H2DCF-DA or Deep Red fluorescent dye staining assays) and caused oxidation of intracellular low molecular weight (mainly GSH) and protein thiols and of NAD(P)H. In vivo studies used the PyMT mouse model, which gives rise to spontaneous breast tumors that are highly glycolytic, useful in assessing the comparative roles of aerobic and glycolytic metabolism. In this model, chronic treatments with the small molecule anti-angiogenic agent BIBF1120 (nintedanib) significantly diminished glycolysis, with the consequence that the growing tumor shifted to reliance on mitochondrial metabolism as the primary energy source. As monotherapy, ME-344 caused minimal inhibition of primary tumors. However, tumors primed by treatment with BIBF1120 showed significantly enhanced sensitivity to ME344, with synergistic antitumor activity. These data indicate complex, but mitochondria-specific effects of ME-344 in cancer cells, differing in extent from normal and linked with drug sensitivity profile with clinical potential through its specific targeting of bioenergetics pathways in cancer cells with the potential for beneficial therapeutic index.']",

        "Background":"['Cancer cells are characterized by an increase in the rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and an altered redox environment compared to normal cells. The role of ROS in tumorigenesis is two-fold. On the one hand, ROS play a causal role in tumor development and progression by inducing genomic instability and aberrant, pro-tumorigenic signalling. On the other hand, high levels of ROS can also be toxic to cancer cells, oxidizing and damaging both DNA and free nucleotides (dNTPs), which can lead to cell death. MutT Homolog 1 (MTH1) is a redox-protective phosphatase that converts ROS-oxidized nucleotides (8-oxo-dGTP) into their corresponding monophosphates, thus preventing their incorporation into genomic DNA and the resultant DNA damage and cell death. Recent studies have shown that MTH1 is up-regulated in various cancers and its activity is required for cancer cell survival and proliferation. Genetic knockdown of MTH1 and MTH1 small molecule inhibition led to DNA damage and cancer-specific cell death in vitro and in vivo, while having little effect on normal cells with a lower rate of ROS production. Hence, the unique redox status of cancer cells makes them reliant on redox-protective proteins like MTH1, which opens a novel therapeutic window to selectively induce cancer cell death via oxidative stress, while sparing normal cells.In order to validate MTH1 as a potential cancer therapeutic target, a wide range of cancer cells (lung, bone, colon, skin, and breast) were treated with a selective MTH1 inhibitor (TH588) or MTH1 shRNAs, and analysed for proliferation, cell survival, ROS levels and DNA damage. We found that MTH1 inhibition impaired cancer cell proliferation as well as anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore, TH588 induced cancer cell damage, as assessed by DNA damage markers and cancer cell death. Various normal, non-transformed cells (normal bronchial epithelial cells, normal lung fibroblasts and normal human epidermal melanocytes) were not affected by MTH1 inhibition. Antioxidants, which eliminate ROS, reversed the effects on cancer cells, indicating that ROS is the driver of cancer cell death and growth impairment upon MTH1 inhibition. Consequently, combination approaches using the MTH1 inhibitor together with pro-oxidants, further increased cancer cell susceptibility to oxidative stress. Based on our data, a MTH1 inhibitor may have clinical potential as a single agent or in combination with ROS inducers for the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Recent large-scale cancer genomic studies have established a framework in which biological functions and genetic interactions of established and novel cancer genes can be explored. One of the major findings of these studies has been the discovery of frequent genetic alterations in chromatin and epigenetic regulators including inactivating mutations in components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. In lung adenocarcinoma in particular, a quarter of tumors have inactivating mutations in the SWI/SNF components Smarca4, ARID1A or the histone modifier SETD2. With the aim of understanding the mechanism of tumor development and identifying potential vulnerabilities of SWI/SNF mutant tumor, we developed a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of lung adenocarcinoma by selectively ablating Smarca4 in the respiratory epithelium. We demonstrate that Smarca4 acts as a bona fide tumor suppressor and cooperates with p53 loss. Cross species integrative gene expression analyses revealed signatures of enhanced oxidative phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) response in Smarca4 mutant murine and human lung tumors. We further show that Smarca4 mutant cells have increased oxygen consumption, enhanced basal and maximal respiratory capacity and production of ROS. This is primarily driven by activation of the mitochondrial master regulator, PGC1alpha. Finally, we show that Smarca4 and other SWI/SNF mutant lung cancer cell lines have exquisite sensitivity to inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation using a novel small molecule that is under development. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for further development of OXPHOS inhibitors as therapies in SWI/SNF mutant tumors.']",

        "Background":"['Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women with a median survival time of 8-10 months’ post treatment. Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80% of the lung cancers and the treatment plan is determined based on the active mutations (EGFR, ALK/ROS, and KRAS) present in the tumor. Patients bearing EGFR mutation initially respond to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy and after 10-14 months of treatment acquire TKI resistance. Consequently, the median PFS for NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation is only 9.5 months. The reason for this acquired drug resistance is not yet fully understood. Recent studies have reported oncogenes such as AXL could be responsible for TKI resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of drug resistance is key in developing a solution to overcome the problem. For this study, we first examined the resistance mechanism and developed a biodegradable targeted nanoparticle based solution to systematically investigate the role of AXL in resistant NSCLC cell lines. In this study we (1) downregulated AXL using siRNA and separately (2) knocked out the AXL gene using crRNA (CRISPR) and treated with TKI. Our results show that AXL is responsible for activation of several EMT related proteins and upregulation of mTOR pathway. We believe the upregulation of these proteins is essential for cancer cells to switch pathways for proliferation and regulating miRNAs linked to mutations. Our results further confirm that AXL is responsible for regulating MMP-2 that is associated with cell invasion. Based on data from multiple cell lines such as H820 and A549, we demonstrate that AXL upregulation is responsible for resistance independent of EGFR activating mutations. The elucidated pathway for drug resistance was further confirmed in cell lines generated by knocking-out the AXL gene. Interpretation for AXL signaling and drug resensitization was confirmed by Western blotting, Zymography, Invasion & Migration assay, Apoptosis assay and MTT toxicity assay. We performed mRNA and miRNA analysis using qRT-PCR to understand gene expression post treatment. During the process of our investigation, we found that NSCLC cells undergo further survival cross talk with other biomarkers. Indeed, we report the first experimental evidence of a survival cross talk between AXL and FN14, a wound healing gene, that enhance cell survival post treatment. Down regulation of both AXL and FN14 dramatically reduced the IC50 of TKI. Based on the mechanism, we designed a gelatin nanoparticle that can carry both AXL and FN14 to deliver it in the tumor cell. The nanoparticle is targeted to tumor using EGFR-antibody and releases the silencing RNA within cytoplasm. We further demonstrated that dual-inhibition of AXL and FN14 in A549 mice xenografts showed tumor reduction compared to controls. In conclusion, inhibition of AXL and FN14 can maximize therapeutic response of TKI, wherein AXL is upregulated before or during drug treatment.']",

The intracellular mechanism underlying this effect was determined by performing immunoblotting and measuring ROS generation, mitochondrial potential and cell death. The radiosensitizer activity of AMRI-59 in vivo was tested in nude mice by treating with AMRI-59 and IR, and measuring tumor volume and assessing apoptosis. Dose-enhancement ratios of 30 μM AMRI-59 in NCI-H460 and NCI-H1299 are 1.57 or 3.38, respectively. Combination with AMRI-59 and IR also increased the production of ROS and disruption of mitochondrial potential via enhancement of PrxI oxidation, which subsequently induced one of DNA damage markers - phospho-γH2AX, and suppressed phosphorylation of ERK, and, finally, activated caspase-3. Notably, inhibition of ROS production prevented ERK suppression, and inhibition of ERK in addition of combination with AMRI-59 and IR increased caspase activation and apoptosis. In a xenograft assay, combination with AMRI-59 and IR delayed tumor growth by 11.4 days compared with controls, yielding an enhancement factor of 1.48.

        "Background":"['Cisplatin is one of the most widely used anticancer agents for the treatment of an array of malignancies. Although multiple mechanisms are involved in cisplatin efficacy, the most prominent and best understood modes of action are the generation of DNA lesions and induction of apoptosis and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent effects on mitochondrial integrity. However, intrinsic or acquired cisplatin resistance can become a limiting factor in cisplatin-based therapy. Evofosfamide is a hypoxia-activated prodrug that is reduced at its nitroimidazole group and preferentially under hypoxic conditions releases Br-IPM, a DNA cross-linker. Evofosfamide is currently being investigated in multiple clinical trials for the treatment of cancer including indications and settings where resistance to cisplatin is observed (e.g. second-line non-small cell lung cancer; NCT01403610). We have previously demonstrated both shared and distinct DNA repair pathways involved with evofosfamide and cisplatin DNA damage. In the current study, we have conducted comparative studies to identify any distinctions in the relative role of ROS underlying cell sensitivity to cisplatin and evofosfamide to help evaluate the potential of evofosfamide to treat cisplatin-resistant tumors. The cisplatin-sensitive cervical cancer cell line ME180, the intermediate cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cell line SK-OV-3, and cisplatin-resistant human lung cancer cell line A549 were investigated with respect to their chemosensitivity to evofosfamide. Unlike cisplatin, evofosfamide exhibited similar potency across all three cell lines. Addition of the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) reduced the potency of cisplatin- but not evofosfamide-mediated cytotoxicity, indicating ROS plays a role in cytotoxicity mediated by cisplatin, but not evofosfamide. ROS levels were investigated using the dye H2DCFDA. Cisplatin induced a concentration-dependent and NAC-inhibitable increase of cellular ROS in cisplatin-sensitive ME-180 cells but not in cisplatin-resistant A549 cells. In contrast, ROS levels were not affected by the addition of evofosfamide under normoxia and hypoxia in both ME180 and A549 cells. In order to ascertain whether mitochondrial pathway-mediated apoptosis was involved in cytotoxicity mediated by evofosfamide and cisplatin, mitochondrial membrane depolarization was investigated with the dye JC-1. Cisplatin induced a concentration-dependent JC-1 polarization and these effects were abolished by NAC. In contrast, evofosfamide did not affect mitochondrial membrane potential. In conclusion, this data demonstrates that ROS is an essential factor in cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity, but not in evofosfamide-mediated cytotoxicity.']",

        "Background":"['Under normal conditions MET receptor activation, internalization, and degradation is a highly controlled process regulated by the binding of its ligand, HGF. In many cancers however, MET becomes highly dysregulated, and MET overexpression, with or without gene amplification, is associated with a poorer prognosis. Aberrant activation of MET can also occur through mutation, or increased autocrine or paracrine HGF production. MET activation leads to increased oncogenic activities including cell migration, proliferation, invasion, survival, tumor neovascularization and decreased apoptosis. Several inhibitors of MET, including type I and type II kinase inhibitors, are currently being investigated in clinical trials. LY2801653 is a type II MET kinase inhibitor being investigated in patients with advanced cancer (trial I3O-MC-JSBA, NCT01285037). In addition to MET, LY2801653 also inhibits ROS1 kinase, and the serine/threonine kinases MKNK1/2, with cell-based IC50 of 23nM and 7nM respectively. ROS1 is an orphan receptor that can be constitutively activated as a fusion protein either by genomic microdeletion or translocation. ROS1 fusion proteins are found in glioblastoma, NSCLC and cholangiocarcinoma. MKNK1/2 are kinases downstream of ERK and p38 and are capable of regulating translation through the direct phosphorylation of eIF4E. Increased MKNK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of the translation factor eIF4E is observed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and is correlated with a poor prognosis. This study evaluated the relative inhibitory effects of LY2801653, Crizotinib, XL184, XL880, and PF4217903 in a variety of cell lines against MET, ROS1, MKNK1/2, ERK, and other downstream molecules. In HCC78, a ROS1-fusion protein bearing cell line, and in NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with the FIG-ROS(s) fusion, LY2801653, XL184 and XL880 were more potent inhibitors of ROS1 compared with Crizotinib. Moreover, LY2801653 and Crizotinib were both efficacious in NIH3T3 FIG-ROS(s) xenografts, although LY2801653 was more potent in reducing p-ROS1 in these tumors than Crizotinib. In NCI-H2122 and Hs746T cells (mutated MET), A2780 cells (MET-negative), KP-4 cells (MET autocrine), H441 cells (HGF-independent; MET positive), HCT116 (mutated KRAS), and the cholangiocarcinoma cell lines EGI-1 and TFK-1, LY2801653 demonstrated more potent inhibitory activity against MKNK1/2 versus treatment with XL184 and XL880, while Crizotinib had no observed inhibitory activity against MKNK1/2. LY2801653 also showed inhibitory activity against MKNK1/2 in MET-amplified MKN45 cells. These findings suggests there may be clinical merits to testing LY2801653 in tumor types associated with increased MKNK1/2 activity or ROS1 fusion proteins alone, or in conjunction with aberrant MET activity, such as colorectal carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma.']",

        "Background":"['Erlotinib is an orally available EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor which has significant clinical activity in previously treated patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as in maintenance therapy after frontline chemotherapy. Although it has shown efficacy in NSCLC with both wild-type and mutant EGFR, it is much more effective in tumors with activating EGFR mutations than in those tumors which have wild-type EGFR. This study identifies autophagy induction as a potential mechanism for the relative resistance of wild-type EGFR NSCLC cells to erlotinib. Autophagy is a tightly regulated lysosomal self-digestion process that may promote cell survival and/or be involved in type II cell death. The potential role of autophagy in erlotinib-induced cytotoxicity has not been well defined. We used four wild-type EGFR NSCLC cell lines, which are either erlotinib-sensitive (H322 and H358) or erlotinib-resistant (H460 and A549), to determine if treatment with erlotinib induces autophagy. We then assessed the effect of disrupting autophagy by chemical and genetic approaches on erlotinib-induced cytotoxicity. Erlotinib at a clinically relevant concentration (2 M) induced autophagy, as shown by increased MDC staining, increased conversion of LC3-I (the cytosolic form) to LC3-II (the lapidated form associated with autophagosome), and the formation of autophagic vacuoles, in all tested cell lines. Autophagy induction by erlotinib was greater in resistant cells than in sensitive cells, suggesting that autophagy is a cytoprotective mechanism. This was confirmed with the use of autophagy inhibitors chloroquine (CQ), 3-methyladenine, and bafilomycin A1, which synergistically increased erlotinib cytotoxicity. Similar enhancement was seen with knockdown of Atg-5 and Beclin-1 gene expression. Cotreatment with CQ did not alter erlotinib-induced EGFR signaling inhibition or G1-phase arrest, but markedly activated mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, disrupting autophagy by CQ or other inhibitors enhanced erlotinib-induced upregulation of BIM expression, and knockdown of BIM expression by siRNA attenuated the cytotoxicity induced by the combination. In addition, inhibition of autophagy by CQ enhanced erlotinib-induced ROS generation and activation of p38 but not JNK signaling. Inhibition of ROS generation by N-acetyl-cysteine, or inhibition of p38 by SB202190 attenuated the cytotoxic effect of the combination, suggesting that ROS generation and p38 activation are potential mediators of the synergism observed. The ability to adapt to anti-EGFR therapy by triggering autophagy may be a major determinant of resistance to erlotinib in NSCLC tumors with wild-type EGFR. Inhibition of autophagy by CQ or other inhibitors represents a novel strategy to potentiate erlotinib efficacy in NSCLC tumors with wild-type EGFR.

Results', ' Twenty-three patients were involved in this study with a median age of 55.5 years and male-to-female ratio of 2.4', '1 The median OS from initiation of crizotinib has not been reached; 1-year overall survival was 71.2%. Crizotinib treatment demonstrated median PFS of 9.6 months (95% CI, 3.0-24.1 months). The ORR was 70.9%. Complete response was achieved in 4.2% of patients, and partial response was achieved in 66.7% of patients. The most frequently reported adverse effects of crizotinib (Grade 1 / 2) were muscle ache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, edema, elevated transaminases, bradycardia, and vision disorders. Grade 3 / 4 diarrhea was reported in 12.5% of patients. The proportion of patients who required dose reduction because of Crizotinib-induced bradycardia was 8.3% of patients. Conclusions', ' Crizotinib appears to be a very favorable option for treating patients with stage IV ALK-positive NSCLC. Crizotinib showed a very tolerable toxicity profile.']",

        "Background":"['Gene fusions are an important class of cancer-contributing somatic alteration, and have an important significance as a tumor-initiating event and as a molecular therapeutic target for specific tumors. We analyzed RNA sequencing, DNA copy number and gene mutation data from 4,366 primary tumor samples to comprehensively detect fusion events in 13 tumor types. To reduce the number of false-positive predictions, we developed strict quality criteria on the basis of gene homology, transcript allele fraction (TAF), and partner gene variety. In addition, we used fusions detected in RNAseq data from 364 normal tissue samples to extract tumor-specific fusions. In total, 7,887 fusion transcripts with high confidence were detected across 13 tumor types. Our fusion prediction was validated by supporting evidence for a genomic rearrangement for 78 of 79 fusions in 48 glioma samples where whole genome sequencing data was available. Fusion transcript frequency was positively correlated with the levels of genomic instability in cancers, whereas tumor samples harboring fusions contained statistically significantly fewer driver gene mutations. We identified 221 fusion transcripts involving a tumor suppressor gene and these were wildtype in majority (98.2%), suggesting the fusion has a disruptive effect and a role in tumorigenesis. We identified at least one in-frame protein kinase fusion in 324 of 4,366 samples (7.4%). Potentially therapeutic targetable kinase fusions such as ALK, ROS, RET, NTRK, and FGFR gene families were detected in thyroid carcinoma (8.7%), glioblastoma (4.4%), bladder carcinoma (3.3%), lung squamous cell carcinoma (2.3%), lung adenocarcinoma (1.6%), lower grade glioma (1.5%), and head and neck cancer (1.0%), suggesting a potential for application of kinase inhibitors for multiple tumor types. In-frame fusion transcripts involving histone methyltransferase or histone demethylase genes, which may also be considered as therapeutic targets, were detected in 111 samples (2.5%). In summary, the landscape of transcript fusions detected across a large number of tumor samples revealed fusion events with clinical relevance that have not been previously recognized. Our findings support the concept of basket clinical trials where patients are matched with experimental therapies based on their genomic profile rather than the tissue where the tumor originated.']",

        "Background":"['Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common subtype of lung cancer and is strongly associated with smoking. In contrast to adenocarcinomas of the lung, SCCs do not significantly harbor epidermal growth factor (EGFR) mutations or ALK, ROS1 or RET translocations, which are therapeutically tractable. SCC of the lung and SCC of the head and neck region and esophagus not only share risk factors, morphologic features and mechanisms of tumorigenesis but also frequent fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene alterations. In addition, we found that FGFR2 and FGFR3 expression were also altered in patient derived models of SCC of various origins. FGFRs may thus represent viable therapeutic targets for the treatment of SCC.BAY 1163877, an orally available and potent inhibitor of FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3, inhibited SCC cell proliferation as well as downstream FGFR signaling in vitro. When applied in vivo, BAY 1163877 was able to reduce growth of a FGFR1-overexpressing lung SCC xenograft model, a FGFR1-overexpressing esophageal SCC xenograft model, and a FGFR3-overexpressing head and neck SCC xenograft model, achieving reductions in tumor growth by 67 to 92% as compared to the vehicle control. BAY 1163877 was very well tolerated in all models performed.These data suggest that selective inhibition of FGFR1 to 3 with BAY 1163877 might have therapeutic potential for the treatment of SCC malignancies. A phase I clinical trial (NCT01976741) to determine the safety, tolerability and recommended Phase 2 dose in advanced cancer patients is ongoing.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Major driver mutations of lung cancer are largely considered to be mutually exclusive. Although a few exceptions of coexisting driver mutations have been noted, it is thought that the coexistence of ALK, RET, and ROS1 rearrangements with other major driver mutations is also rare. However, NGS has allowed us to revisit this assumption given the amount of clinical data that are generated. We report findings of the frequency of driver mutations and their coexistence in a cohort of 181 lung cancer patients tested in our laboratory. Methods', ' A comprehensive molecular- and histopathology-based strategy was conducted on FFPE samples of 181 lung cancer patients. NGS molecular profiling was performed using Molecular Healths Engineus Profile+ 613-targeted gene panel. For patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma; ALK, RET, and ROS1 rearrangements were evaluated using FISH method (Personalized Dx, CA). Results', ' Including both NGS and FISH analysis, major driver aberrations were detected as follows', ' KRAS codon 12/13 (50, 28%), EGFR exon 19/21 (26, 14%), BRAF V600E (7, 4%), BRAF non-V600E (4, 2%), PIK3CA (5, 3%), ERBB2 amplification (4, 2%), MET amplification (4, 2%), ALK rearrangement (7, 4%), RET rearrangement (3, 2%), and ROS1 rearrangement (2, 1%). The majority (101 out of 109, 93%) of these specimens harbored only one major driver mutation. Coexistence of two major drivers were identified in 8 patients (8 out of 109, 7%), including KRAS/PIK3CA (3), KRAS codon 12/13/BRAF non-V600E (1), ALK fusion/KRAS p.G12V (1), ALK fusion/EGFR p.L858R (1), RET fusion/KRAS p.G12C (1), and RET fusion/EGFR exon 19 del (1). Among tumors with ALK, RET or ROS1 rearrangements, 30% (4/12) harbored another driver mutation. Conclusions', ' Our results illustrate the coexistence of multiple driver mutations in a small but significant number of NSCLC patients, including ALK, RET, or ROS1 rearrangements. Concomitant testing of both ALK, RET, and ROS1 rearrangements and comprehensive molecular profiling of other driver genes may be necessary for better clinical management of NSCLC patients.']",

Large scale screening systems for these rare populations are necessary for the development of molecular targeted therapies. Thus, a nationwide lung cancer genomic screening project in Japan (LC-SCRUM-Japan) has been operated since February 2013. Methods', ' Non-squamous NSCLCs without EGFR mutations were eligible for inclusion in this study. The tumors were analyzed for ALK/RET/ROS1 fusions using RT-PCR, and detected fusions were confirmed by FISH. Since March 2015, this nationwide project has been amended to an academic-industrial collaboration project with 14 pharmaceutical companies, and the samples were further subjected to a next-generation sequencing (NGS) system, Oncomine Comprehensive Assay, enabling the simultaneous analysis of 143 cancer-related genes. Results', ' As of December 31, 2015, 195 institutions across Japan were participating and 2161 patients had been enrolled. Among 1988 available samples, including 497 for the NGS analysis, ALK/RET/ROS1 fusions were detected in 37 (2%)/51 (3%)/86 (4%), respectively. The NGS analysis also showed that 269 cases (54%) had targetable gene alterations, including 82 KRAS mutations (17%), 36 ERBB2 mutations (7%), 28 BRAF mutations (6%), 22 PIK3CA mutations (4%), 6 NRAS mutations (1%), 6 MAP2K1 mutations (1%) and 2 FGFR2 fusions (0.4%). MET/ERBB2/FGFR1 amplifications were also detected by the NGS in 13 (3%)/11 (2%)/3 (1%) cases, respectively. Through this screening, the preplanned numbers of patient with RET and ROS1 fusions (n = 19 and 26, respectively) were successfully enrolled in clinical trials of vandetanib (LURET study in Japan) and of crizotinib (OO12-01 study in East Asia), respectively. Three patients with ERBB2 alterations and 2 with MET amplifications were also enrolled in genotype-matched ongoing trials. Conclusions', ' This nationwide screening system enables efficiently and successfully detecting various targetable gene alterations in NSCLC, thereby contributing to promote cancer precision medicine through the development of targeted therapies.']",
