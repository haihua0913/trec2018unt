        "Background":"['The INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus on human chromosome 9p21 is a hot spot genomic region that undergoes frequent inactivation or deletion in a wide spectrum of human cancers. The locus encodes three cell cycle inhibitory proteins', ' p15INK4b encoded by CDKN2b, p16INK4a encoded by CDKN2a and p14ARF (p19Arf in mice) encoded by an alternative reading frame (ARF) of CDKN2a. We have recently identified a homologous INK4 genomic locus in zebrafish that is surprisingly devoid of ARF sequences, and encodes a single zebrafish ink4ab gene that functions to activate stress-induced senescence. Therefore, evolution of the mammalian INK4 locus to include multiple tumor suppressors sharing regulatory features could attribute to stronger mechanisms of tumor suppression in these longer-lived vertebrates. Oxidative and/or oncogenic stress provokes cellular senescence involving the retinoblastoma (Rb) and ARF/p53 pathways, leading to silencing of growth-promoting genes by methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me) with the histone methyltransferase Suv39h1. We found that ink4ab deficient zebrafish had deregulated Rb signaling and senescence responses, and reduced suv39h1 expression levels that led to poor overall survival. Ink4ab deficient zebrafish had increased lymphocyte proliferation, splenomegaly, and developed multiple spontaneous tumors including metastatic melanoma, osteosarcoma, hepatocellular adenoma, leukemias and myelodysplastic disorders. Moreover, zebrafish heterozygous for both p53 and ink4ab mutations displayed significantly higher tumor incidence compared to p53 heterozygotes with wild-type ink4ab, indicating that ink4ab haploinsufficiency promotes tumorigenesis. To this end, the combined deficiency of ink4ab and p53 accelerates tumor latency, likely by reversing cellular senescence responses. To further examine ARF-independent senescence regulatory roles of INK4 products in a mammalian model, we have generated conditional mice deficient for all three INK4 open reading frames in the adult hematopoietic system. Within seven months, homozygous Ink4a/Ink4b/ARF-/- mice exhibited marked splenomegaly and developed spontaneous tumors, including leukemias and soft tissue sarcomas. Peripheral blood, splenic and bone marrow analyses of homozygous mutant mice showed deregulated lymphocyte development, uncontrolled proliferation, apoptosis and Suv39h1-dependent senescence when compared to heterozygous and wild type mice. These results identify ARF-independent and Suv39h1-dependent senescence regulatory and tumor suppressor mechanisms whose inactivation permits tumor formation in response to oncogenic and/or oxidative stress. Our models offer the opportunity to reveal novel paradigms for promoting cellular senescence as an alternative strategy for cancer prevention and therapy.']",

        "Background":"['The cell cycle regulatory gene INK4A-ARF (CDKN2A) has two alternative transcripts that produce entirely different proteins, namely p14ARF and p16, which have complementary functions as regulators of p53 and pRB tumor suppressor pathways, respectively. The unusual organization of INK4A-ARF has long led to speculation of a need for coordinated regulation of p14ARF and p16. We now show that p14ARF (ARF) regulates the stability of p16 protein in human cancer cell lines, as well as in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In particular, ARF promotes rapid degradation of p16 protein, which is mediated by the proteasome and, more specifically, by interaction of ARF with one of its subunits, REG. Furthermore, this ARF-dependent destabilization of p16 can be abrogated by knock-down of REG or by pharmacological blockade of its nuclear export. Thus our findings have uncovered a novel crosstalk of two key tumor suppressors mediated by a REG-dependent mechanism.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Cancer development is often preceded by the appearance of preneoplastic lesions. In gastric carcinogenesis, chronic inflammation and histopathologic progression of the stomach epithelium lead to the development of metaplasia and eventually adenocarcinoma. Spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) is one of the preneoplastic lesions in the stomach and is triggered by the loss of parietal cells that secrete gastric acid. The Ink4a/Arf locus encodes two structurally unrelated tumor suppressor proteins, p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) in mice. However, little is known regarding the role of these proteins encoded by the INK4a/ARF locus in gastric tumorigenesis.Methods', ' To evaluate the functional role of Ink4a/Arf locus, we crossed mouse gastric cancer modelK19-Wnt1/C2mE mice with Ink4a/Arf (-/-) mouse and generated Ink4a/Arf (-/-) K19-Wnt1/C2mE mice and evaluated the effect of deletion of Ink4a/Arf locus on the parietal cell loss and formation of SPEM and gastric tumor. Results', ' In K19-Wnt1/C2mE mice, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the increase of p19 expression were observed in gastric epithelium along with the parietal cells loss leading to SPEM development. However, the parietal cells loss followed by formation of SPEM and gastric tumor were drastically suppressed in Ink4a/Arf (-/-) K19-Wnt1/C2mE mice. Furthermore, treatment of tamoxifen, an inducer of parietal cells loss, in Ink4a/Arf (-/-) mice revealed that deletion of Ink4a/Arf locus suppresses parietal cells loss in mice. Conclusion', ' These results suggest that activation of p19(ARF) tumor suppressor protein by ROS accumulation paradoxically play a key role in the parietal cells loss leading to gastric tumorigenesis.']",

        "Background":"['The human INK4b-ARF-INK4a genetic locus encodes two closely related members of the INK4 family of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors, p15INK4b and p16INK4a regulating RB phosphorylation and subsequently cell proliferation, and a p53 stabilizer, known as ARF. All of the three products play a pivotal role in tumor suppression and are frequently deleted or inactivated in a wide spectrum of human cancers. Despite the critical role of the mammalian INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus in tumor suppression, its counterpart in zebrafish has not yet been characterized. Zebrafish is an advantageous vertebrate to model human cancers, specifically because of the high fecundity, the ease of performing high-throughput screens, and the genetic conservation with mammals. We identified a syntenic zebrafish ink4ab locus that consists of a single gene orthologous to both mammalian CDKN2a (INK4A) and CDKN2b (INK4B), and functions to activate senescence in response to oxidative stress. Utilizing morpholino targeted knockdown and zebrafish mutants for the ink4ab gene, we have developed a zebrafish model for tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that the zebrafish ink4ab gene functions as a tumor suppressor by controlling cell cycle regulation under stress. Senescence was activated by oxidative stress in wild type embryos but not in embryos with ink4ab deficiency when examined with a whole embryo senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA--gal) assay. Surprisingly, we find that ink4ab deficient embryos also display significantly higher levels of apoptosis than controls. We determined that the apoptosis associated with ink4ab deficiency is p53-dependent. Furthermore, ink4ab deficiency led to significantly lower survival rates, both overall and upon radiation. Ink4ab deficient zebrafish had splenomegaly, increased lymphocyte proliferation, and developed spontaneous tumors including metastatic melanoma, osteosarcoma, leukemia and myelodysplastic disorders. Thus, the zebrafish ink4ab protein functions as a tumor suppressor similarly to the human p15INK4B and p16INK4A. To study the upstream control of zebrafish ink4ab expression, we investigated the orchestrated regulation by the Bmi-1 oncogene, and identified bmi-1a as a repressor of ink4ab expression. Zebrafish heterozygous for both p53 and ink4ab mutations displayed significantly higher tumor incidence compared to p53 heterozygotes with wild-type ink4ab, indicating that ink4ab haploinsufficiency promotes tumorigenesis. To this end, the combined deficiency of ink4ab and p53 accelerates the latency and broadens the tumor spectrum including the formation of retinoblastoma. Collectively, the zebrafish ink4ab model of tumor suppression provides a platform to perform large-scale screens for small molecules that modulate tumorigenesis in the ink4ab deficient fish, and permit defining the genetic pathways of CDKN2a- and CDKN2b-mediated tumor suppression.']",

        "Background":"['Obesity, a disease linked to increased number of adipocytes in various tissues, is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for the development of breast cancer. Obesity has been reported to be associated with the occurrence of larger, more advanced tumors and aggressive cancer pathological features, including lymph node metastasis, advanced tumor stage, and high grade. Accumulating recent evidence highlights the tumor-surrounding adipose tissue as a key component of breast cancer progression. However, the molecular basis of adipocyte-related breast carcinogenesis remains elusive. To shed light on this important phenomenon, we investigated the autocrine and paracrine roles of the tumor suppressor p16 INK4A protein in adipocytes. We have found that down-regulation of p16INK4A by specific shRNA in breast adipocytes enhanced their migration/invasion abilities and increased the expression/secretion levels of various adipokines including leptin. In addition, we have shown that p16INK4A protein inhibits the pro-carcinogenic effects of breast stromal adipocytes in vitro and in tumor xenografts through repressing the expression/secretion of Leptin. Indeed, p16INK4A suppresses Leptin at the mRNA level. This effect is mediated trough miR-141 and miR-146b-5p, which inhibits Leptin expression through a specific sequence at the Leptin 3UTR. In addition, we present clear evidence that down-regulation of p16INK4A is sufficient to trans-activate breast stromal adipocytes, which promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition in normal breast luminal cells in a leptin-dependent manner.These results provide the first indication that p16INK4A and miR-141 and miR-146b-5p represses Leptin and its procarcinogenic effects in breast stromal adipocytes.

        "Meeting_name":" Regulation of p16Ink4a - Rb pathway by Cyclin D1- Dmp1 interaction",
        "Background":"['Cyclin D1 is a crucial regulator in mammalian cell cycle that binds to and activates CDK4/6, which is an kinase that drives cells to enter S phase. It has an important oncogenic role in breast cancer because the CCND1 gene is amplified in 15% of cases and its protein expression is elevated in up to 50% of cases. Previous studies demonstrate that cyclin D1 overexpression can cause pRb hyper-phosphorylation and therefore induce cell hyperproliferation, which can result in the development of mammary adenocarcinoma. In addition, cyclin D1 is found to contribute to tumorigenesis by affecting the activity of transcriptional factors via physical interaction. One of the affected transcriptional factors is called Dmp1, which acts as a tumor suppressor when receiving oncogenic signals. It activates Arf by binding to its promoter region, therefore causing Arf, p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in normal cells. Our recent study in MMTV-neu mice showed that loss of Dmp1 significantly accelerates mammary carcinogenesis. Although both Dmp1 and cyclin D1 play vital roles in breast cancer prevention and development respectively, the biological functions and significance of Dmp1-cyclin D1 interaction remains to be explored. To identify the impact of their interaction on the activation of p16Ink4a/ p19Arf promoters induced by cyclin D1, MEFs were overexpressed cyclin D1 and we found the endogenous p16Ink4a and p19Arf transcripts were increased up to 7 fold. However, their transcription level was not affected in Dmp1-null MEFs. Moreover, cyclin D1 mutant 142-253 that cannot bind to Dmp1could not fully activate the p16Ink4a/p19Arf promoters, indicating the activation of p16Ink4a/p19Arf promoters by cyclin D1 is dependent on Dmp1, and loss of Dmp1-cyclin D1 interaction will attenuate this effect. To identify the potential regulation of p16Ink4a by Dmp1, we performed EMSA and luciferase reporter assay, and we found that Dmp1 activates the p16Ink4a promoter by directly binding to its promoter. Moreover, the p16Ink4a mRNA and protein level were increased upon Dmp1 overexpression. The above results suggest that Dmp1 is a physiological regulator of p16Ink4a. To explore the effect of Dmp1 on Cdk4 kinase activity, 293T cells were overexpressed cyclin D1 alone or together with Dmp1, and we found there was less cyclin D1 associated with CDK4 after CDK4 immunoprecipitation. As a consequence, pRb phosphorylation was decreased in CDK4 kinase assay. These results suggest that Dmp1 decreases CDK4 kinase activity by impairing cyclin D1-CDK4 interaction. Taken together, our data suggest that Dmp1 decreases pRb phosphorylation in two ways', ' one is to directly bind to and activate p16INK4a, and the other one is to block the CDK4 kinase activity by binding to cyclin D1. In addition, cyclin D1-Dmp1 interaction is indispensible in activation of p16Ink4a/p19Arf promoters induced by cyclin D1.']",

        "Background":"['Although most superficial bladder cancers can be removed transurethrally with excellent prognosis, clinical outcome is much more problematic for patients with muscle-invasive disease. Indeed, invasive bladder cancer is a major clinical challenge since it is highly associated with postoperative recurrence and metastasis. Current treatments for those lethal forms of bladder cancer include systemic chemotherapy and molecular targeted therapy; however, survival is poor since most patients develop resistance to the drugs within a short timeframe. Clearly, there is a need to identify novel therapeutic options for invasive bladder cancer as well as a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. We have been investigating mechanisms of drug resistance using genetically-engineered mouse models of invasive bladder cancer based on the combinatorial deletion of p53 and Pten in bladder epithelium. p53 and PTEN are frequently inactivated in human bladder cancers, particularly those with poor prognosis. Indeed, allograft tumors established from these mice responded initially to the treatment with cisplatin, docetaxel, or rapamycin but eventually developed resistance. We have observed that these p53; PTEN deficient tumors express robust levels of p19Arf, while targeted deletion of Arf retards the aquisition of resistance following drug treatment. The significance of this expression was further suggested by analysis of a published gene expression profile of human bladder cancers which revealed that high Arf expression is an independent predictor of poor survival of invasive bladder cancer patients. Furthermore, following drug treatment in the mouse model, the Arf-positive, compared to the Arf-negative, tumors were significantly enriched in extracellular matrix/integrin signaling gene signature consistent with activation of downstream PI3K-mTOR pathway, suggesting that a model for drug resistance is via PI3K pathway activation. We have observed similar results in human bladder cancer cell lines either following knock-down of p14Arf in J82 cells that express endogenous p14Arf or following forced expression of p14Arf in ARF-negative UMUC3 human bladder cancer cells, and in both cases it was coincident with deregulated activation of PI3K-mTOR pathway. Thus, we propose that Arf confers drug resistance on bladder cancer by activating PI3K-mTOR pathway, highlighting a potential therapeutic target for advanced invasive bladder cancer patients.']",

        "Background":"['In addition to serving crucial roles in bone development, Hedgehog (Hh) signaling contributes to the development and progression of many cancers, making it an attractive candidate for treatment of bone-resident cancers. Recent data suggest that Hh-targeted agents exert pluripotent effects on host bone microenvironment cells through both cell-intrinsic and paracrine mechanisms, interrupting the vicious cycle of tumor cell, osteoblast (OB), osteoclast (OC), and bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) interactions in bone metastatic breast cancers. Here, reciprocal stimulation between tumor cells and bone cells enhance both tumor growth and bone pathology. Similarly, development of osteosarcoma (OS), the most common primary bone cancer, is strongly influenced by conditions within surrounding microenvironment providing additional points for therapeutic intervention.The 5-year survival rate for metastatic OS is under 30%, highlighting the need for novel and targeted treatments. We have demonstrated that mice deficient in the tumor suppressor ARF (p19ARF; p14ARF in humans) have enhanced rates of bone turnover, mimicking the adolescent growth period in which OS is prevalent. By crossing Arf-/- mice with those expressing Tax, an HTLV-1 oncogene that results in osteolytic tumors, we developed a model of high penetrant spontaneous OS that recapitulates many aspects of human disease. Here, suppression of bone turnover with the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid prevented the development of OS, suggesting that enhanced OC activity may stimulate OS growth. In agreement, we found that Tax+Arf-/- OS had increased RANKL-to-OPG ratios resulting in increased osteoclastogenic ability. Compared to normal osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cell precursors, Tax+Arf-/- OS cells have increased expression of Hh pathway genes and exhibit increased susceptibility to Hh inhibitors (SMO antagonists). In particular, Tax+Arf-/- OS cells express high levels of the Hh ligands Sonic (SHH) and Indian (IHH), suggesting they may stimulate surrounding cells in a paracrine fashion. Notably, BMSC derived from non-tumor bearing Tax+Arf-/- mice also exhibit increased expression of pro-tumorigenic factors (including IL-6 and IGF), generating a fertile soil. SHH or conditioned media from Tax+Arf-/- OS cells enhanced OC activity and BMSC cell production of pro-tumorigenic growth factors. Furthermore, the increased OB and OC differentiation and activity present in Tax+Arf-/- cells could be abrogated with SMO inhibitors. We have established an OS cell line from Tax+Arf-/- mice (TAN) with the ability to form mineralized tumors upon intratibial injection. Using this model, we hypothesize that treatment with SMO antagonists will decrease OS growth due to both tumor cytotoxic effects and direct effects on host bone microenvironment cells that abrogate the pro-tumor microenvironment.']",

The role of this early combined inactivation, and the oncogenic drivers that subsequently lead to tumor development, are poorly defined. To characterize the precancerous role of concurrently mutated CDKN2A and TP53, we combined a number of recent advances to disrupt both loci in primary cells. First, we grew primary keratinocytes in medium conditioned by irradiated J2-3T3 cells and containing an inhibitor of ROCK kinases, conditions that greatly extend their normally limited proliferative potential. Second, we transfected primary keratinocytes with plasmid vectors expressing both Cas9 and sets of guide RNAs targeting specific regions of CDKN2A and TP53. We targeted either or both of the p14Arf and p16Ink4a protein products of CDKN2A for knockout (KO), together with either TP53 KO or a TP53 point mutation (R248Q protein product), two major categories of genetic alterations of p53 in HNSCC. Third, we evaluated use of nutlin-3, an inhibitor of p53-MDM2 interaction, to try to select against cells that still contained wild-type p53. We assessed KO efficiency by PCR of genomic DNA; the TP53 point mutation introduced a SauA3i site into TP53. Two weeks of nutlin-3 treatment led to a 3 fold increase in p53 KO efficiency versus untreated cells (50% versus 14%). p16Ink4a KO efficiencies were enhanced 2 to 14 fold after nutlin-3 treatment, depending on the specific Cas9/guide-RNA constructs used. In cells transfected to produce p53 R248Q, 14% of PCR products amplifying the mutated region after nutlin-3 exposure showed Sau3Ai digestion, whereas no Sau3Ai digestion was detected in untreated cells. This result suggests that up to 14% of nutlin-3 treated keratinocytes had integrated the mutated donor oligo sequence. We similarly enrich for mutated keratinocytes having p14Arf-specific or combined CDKN2A KO along with TP53 KO or mutation. Combined transfection to generate concurrent CDKN2A and TP53 mutations under conditions that allow extended proliferation in culture, followed by selection for successful TP53 mutation with nutlin-3, will facilitate identification of keratinocyte clones with bi-allelic knockout genotypes. This panel of keratinocytes with concurrent CDKN2A and TP53 mutations will help delineate the roles of these genes in early cancer development and will allow screening for the oncogenic drivers required for tumor development and metastasis, with emphasis on discovering more effective and specific druggable targets for improving treatment.']",

        "Background":"['We have recently reported on the discovery of a long non-coding RNA imbedded in intron 2 of the p16/ARF (CDKN2A) locus at 9p21. CAI2 is a non-conserved, RNA pol II regulated gene with whose expression is highly correlated with parent genes p16 and ARF. However, CAI2 is expressed in cell lines deleted for p16, ARF and even p15, and is expressed cell lines epigenetically silenced for p16 and/or ARF. Furthermore, treatment of p16 and/or ARF epigenetically silenced cell lines with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidin allows p16 and/or ARF re-expression while having no influence on CAI2, confirming independent regulation. Speculating, therefore, that the regulatory region of CAI2 lies imbedded in the non-transcribed portion of intron 2, we created expression constructs of the immediate 5 region of CAI2. However, consistent with a bioinformatical analysis, no regulatory activity was detected. This suggests that this non-coding RNA is non-traditionally controlled by remote but yet to be identified regulatory element(s) and/or mechanisms. By colony formation assay, CAI2 overexpression can inhibit cell growth in the p16 intact HEK293T and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell lines. RNA Immunoprecipitation has revealed that CAI2 interacts with H3K27me3, a recruiter of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) that modulates chromatin structure and gene expression, and BMI1, a PRC1 complex protein that is a negative regulator of p16. Consistent with this effect, CAI2 can induce p16 expression in HEK293T cells, and this was hypothesized to be the mechanism by which CAI2 inhibits cell growth. However, we now show that CAI2 can also inhibit colony formation in the p16/ARF deleted MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Interestingly however, CAI2 overexpression had little to no effect on 2D cultures of HEK293T or MCF7 cells including DNA synthesis, XTT metabolic activity or cell count.As CAI2 is imbedded in the p16/ARF gene, standard siRNAs may inadvertently influence p16 and/or ARF expression due to actions on their pre-mRNAs. Therefore, we created a series of partial CAI2 knockouts using CRISPR technology and compared their growth by colony formation assay. Notably, clones containing a partial knockout of the 5 region of CAI2 proliferated faster than mock transfected clones, consistent with the growth suppressive properties observed with CAI2 overexpression. In 2D cultures, a small increase in DNA synthesis was also observed in the partial deletions. The HEK293T clones containing partial deletions of CAI2 also exhibited small increases in expression of the remaining intact portions of the gene with a concomitant decrease in p16 expression, all consistent with an influence of CAI2 on p16 expression and cell growth; no influence on ARF expression was observed.Taken together, the data demonstrate that CAI2 is capable of influencing p16 expression, but this influence is insufficient to fully account for the ability of CAI2 to regulate growth, and we conclude that CAI2 is a bona fide tumor suppressor gene in its own right.']",

In addition p16INK4a plays a crucial role in the process of replicative senescence. p16INK4a loss or inactivation is associated with predisposition to melanoma, pancreatic cancer and other malignancies, highlighting its recognized function as a tumor suppressor. Given its critical role in cell homeostasis, there is much interest in understanding the molecular regulators of p16INK4a expression.Here we report that p16 belongs to the expanding group of proteins whose translation is influenced by sequence/structural features of the 5UTR mRNA that are endowed of cellular Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) activity. To study the potential for p16INK4a 5UTR to drive cap-independent translation we developed a dual-luciferase assay using a bicistronic vector (named pRuF), where wild type or deletion mutants of the p16INK4a 5UTRs were cloned as intervening sequence between Renilla and Firefly luciferase cDNAs. The p16INK4a 5UTR sequence in inverted orientation was included as additional control. Results of reporters relative activity coupled to control analyses of actual bicistronic mRNA transcription, indicated that the wild type p16INK4a 5UTR could stimulate Firefly luciferase translation. The IRES-like activity could not be mapped to a specific region of the 5UTR based on results with deletion constructs, and was two-fold stronger compared to the cMYC 5UTR, a known cellular IRES used as a control. Notably, hypoxic stress in particular, but also the treatment with mTOR inhibitors, enhanced the translation-stimulating property of the p16INK4a 5UTR. RNA immuno-precipitation (RIP) assays performed in the p16-positive melanoma-derived cell line SK-Mel-28 suggest that the RNA-binding protein YBX-1, known to act in translation control, can participate in p16 INK4a translation. Experiments were YBX-1 was over-expressed or knocked-down by si-RNA confirmed its involvement in p16INK4a cap-independent translational regulation. Taken collectively, our results suggest that the 5UTR region can modulate p16INK4a mRNA translation efficiency.']",

        "Background":"['The exonic ANRIL (P15AS) is a 3.8-kb lncRNA transcribed from the antisense strand of the P14 promoter and flanking regions. Recently, we have constructed a P16 promoter DNA methyltransferase (P16-Dnmt) using the pTRIPZ vector that can specifically methylate human P16 CpG islands and found that P16 methylation directly leads to gene transcription silence [Cui et al. Genome Biology 2015, 16', '252]. However, whether ANRIL transcription is affected by P16 DNA methylation has not previously been reported. In the present study, correlation between endogenous P16, P15, P14 mRNA and ANRIL levels in a panel of cell lines were determined using quantitative RT-PCR. Unexpectedly, the results showed that ANRIL transcriptional level was positively and significantly correlated with the P16 mRNA level (r = 0.774, P = 0.003), but not correlated with the P15 or P14 mRNA levels (r = 0.09 or 0.30, P = 0.78 or 0.35). These phenomena were confirmed using the public available transcriptome data in the Broad-Novartis Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). Furthermore, transcription of both ANRIL and P16 mRNA were observed only in cancer cell lines in which the P16 alleles are unmethylated (Caski, SGC7901, BGC823, GES1, Siha and HeLa), but not in these cell lines in which the P16 alleles are fully methylated (Colo205, PC3, MHCC97H, RKO, SW480 and AGS). These suggest the possibility that methylation of the P16 promoter may inactivate transcription of ANRIL as well as P16. To study the possible causality between P16 DNA methylation and transcriptional silence of ANRIL, we employed P16-Dnmt to induce P16-specific DNA methylation in gastric cancer BGC823 cells, and found that transcription levels of both P16 and ANRIL were significantly decreased by the induced P16 DNA methylation (P<0.001 and 0.024, respectively). Besides, transcription level of P14 was also reduced (P = 0.043) while the P14 promoter CpG islands remained to be unmethylated. In contrast, P16 DNA demethylation induced by an artificial P16-specific transcription factor [Zhang et al. Human Gene Therapy 2012, 23', '1071-81] re-activated transcription of both ANRIL and P16 in H1299 cells (P<0.001). The mechanism of inactivation of ANRIL expression by P16 DNA methylation is under investigation. In conclusion, transcription of ANRIL is regulated by P16 DNA methylation.']",

        "Background":"['The tumor suppressor protein p16INK4a is a member of the INK4 family of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors, which are involved in the regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle. However, the mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative effects of p16INK4a have not been fully elucidated. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified the eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF)1A2 as a novel interacting partner of p16INK4a. eEF1A2 is thought to function as an oncogene in cancers. The p16INK4a protein interacted with all but the D2 (250-327 aa) domain of eEF1A2. Computational docking study predicted that D24/D131 residues of p16INK4a interacted with eEF1A2 and it was confirmed by pull-down assay with mutant p16INK4a (D24A/D131E). Ectopic expression of p16INK4a decreased the expression of eEF1A2 and inhibited cancer cell growth. Furthermore, suppression of protein synthesis by expression of p16INK4a ex vivo was verified by luciferase reporter activity. Microinjection of p16INK4a mRNA into the cytoplasm of Xenopus embryos suppressed the luciferase mRNA translation, whereas the combination of p16INK4a and morpholino-eEF1A2 resulted in a further reduction in translational activity. We conclude that the interaction of p16INK4a with eEF1A2, and subsequent downregulation of the expression and function of eEF1A2 is a novel mechanism explaining the anti-proliferative effects of p16INK4a.']",

To understand this phenomenon, we assessed the expression of p53 pathway members, which are most effected by p14ARF. The expression of androgen receptor (AR), a pivotal prostate cancer regulator, which is also affected by p14arf and MDM2 was analyzed as well. The studies used archival prostate tumor tissues obtained from prostatectomies performed at the Veterans Affairs-Northern California Health Care System in Mather California between 1996 and 2002 to better define the relationship between these interrelated networks. A prostate tumor tissue array consisting of 78 tumors of differing stages and grades was constructed to evaluate correlations between multiple parameters. Immunohistochemical studies assessed expression of the proliferation marker Ki67, p53, MDM2, MDM4, p14ARF, and the AR in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of tumor and adjacent cells. p53, MDM4, p14ARF and AR were detected in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of tumor and non-tumor cells, but were predominantly nuclear. MDM2 expression was primarily cytoplasmic in tumor cells. Multivariate analysis of the immunohistochemical markers identified a strong correlation between expression of p14ARF and AR. Studies utilizing the prostate CWR22 xenograft and LNCaP cell line models revealed that castration or androgen deprivation resulted in reduced p14arf levels and that this effect correlated with a precipitous decline in E2F1-3a levels. In a reciprocal analysis, RB ablation enhanced p14ARF transcription, arguing that the E2F/RB pathway mediates AR-dependent p14ARF expression. However, we also identified an AR binding site located 40 KB upstream of the p14ARF gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies showed that in prostate cells this site was bound by AR. ChIP studies also revealed E2F1 and E2F3 were present at the p14ARF promoter.

However, the molecular basis of adipocyte-related breast carcinogenesis remains elusive. In this study, we established and characterized normal stromal adipocytes from post-plastic surgery of breast tissues from obese and lean women. We have shown that adipocytes from obese women express low level of the tumor suppressor p16 protein, have higher secretion of various adipokines and higher invasion and migration capabilities as compared to adipocytes from lean women. In addition, down-regulation of p16INK4A by shRNA in adipocytes from lean women increased the expression/secretion levels of various adipokines including leptin, activated breast adipocytes and enhanced their migration/invasion abilities. Consequently, media conditioned with p16-deficient adipocytes or adipocytes from obese women promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition in normal breast luminal cells in a leptin-dependent manner and induced tumor growth in vivo. Indeed, p16INK4A suppresses Leptin at the mRNA level through miR-141 and miR-146b-5p, which inhibits Leptin expression through a specific sequence at the Leptin 3’UTR. These results show the existence of active adipocytes in the mammary gland of obese women in absence of breast cancer cells and provide the first indication that p16INK4A through targeting miR-141 and miR-146b-5p suppresses Leptin and its procarcinogenic effects.

Deficiency of Pten, one of the most commonly mutated genes in cancer, directly triggers a senescence program critically depending on the p19Arf-p53 fail-safe pathway. We identified a novel and unexpected tumor suppressive role of IL-6/Stat3 signaling in a Pten-deficient murine prostate cancer model. Our data provide evidence that activation of IL-6/Stat3 signaling axis is implicated in oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Strikingly, genetic ablation of IL-6 strongly promoted prostate cancer initiation, progression and metastasis in Pten-deficient mice. Mechanistically, IL6/Stat3 signaling regulates p19Arf-p53-induced senescence by modulating expression of the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 in pre-neoplastic cells. Critically, in prostate cancer patients low expression of Stat3 or p14Arf, the human homologue of p19Arf, correlates with poor survival.

Both tumor suppressor and oncogenic roles of Notch have been implicated in the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). We investigated the functional consequences of Notch activation in head and neck as well as esophageal SCCs (HNSCC and ESCC). Methods', ' Primary tumor tissues annotated with known clinical outcomes were analyzed. Human esophageal cells immortalized with telomerase or human papilloma virus E6/E7 genes, their derivatives expressing mutant p53 and ESCC cell lines were stably transduced with ICN1, an active form of Notch1 in a regulatable manner (Tet-On system). Notch was inhibited by dominant negative mastermind-like1 (DNMAML1), a genetic pan-Notch inhibitor or -secretase inhibitors (GSI). 8xCSL-luciferase reporter was used to assess Notch-mediated transcriptional activity. RNA interference was done targeting either CSL or p16INK4A. Senescence was determined by cell growth inhibition and senescence-associated -galactosidase assays. Cell growth was tested in soft agar and immunodeficient mice. Gene expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results', ' In primary tumors, the active form of Notch1 (ICN1Val1744) was detected as intense nuclear staining of tumor cells in the invasive fronts in 29% of HNSCC (n=17) and 56% of ESCC (n=171). Nuclear ICN1Val1744 was significantly associated with a poor 5-year survival in postsurgical ESCC patients (n=115). In culture, ICN1 induced cellular senescence through CSL-dependent p16INK4A induction, which was antagonized by DNMAML1 or knockdown of either CSL or p16INK4A. Moreover, ICN1 failed to induce senescence in immortalized cells expressing E6/E7 or ESCC cells with a deleted INK4 locus. However, p53 mutation did not prevent ICN1-induced senescence. In soft agar and xenograft transplantation, ICN1 stimulated colony formation and tumor growth of ESCC cells that negated senescence. Histology revealed an increased number of less-differentiated tumor cells upon ICN1 induction. Moreover, GSI treatment of mice with xenografted ESCC cells resulted in tumor necrosis. Conclusions', ' These data indicate that Notch activation contributes to disease progression in ESCC. While ICN1 induces senescence, loss of p16INK4A-mediated senescence checkpoint point functions may be required in ICN1-mediated malignant transformation, thus providing a novel mechanistic insight into how Notch signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of SCCs.']",

        "Background":"['Over the last several years it has become apparent that the majority of the genome is transcribed with the number of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes significantly higher than the number of protein-encoding genes. The 9p21 locus harbors a number of tumor suppressor genes including p15, p10, ARF, chARF, p16, p16, p12 and p16-ACT, and the long ncRNAs ANRIL and p15AS. The abundance of regulatory genes in such a short span perhaps accounts for why this region is frequently inactivated in many cancers. We report on the novel lncRNA CAI2, a non-conserved gene imbedded in p16/ARF intron 2 with homology that is limited to the upper primates. CAI2 is a single exon, RNA pol II regulated gene with a poly A signal localized in p16/ARF exon 3, yet independent of the p16/ARF poly A signal. The expression levels of CAI2, p16 and ARF genes are highly correlated, being low in normal tissue but high in most tumor cell lines with an intact 9p21 locus. Notably, high levels of CAI2 expression are associated with advanced-stage of neuroblastoma, one of the few tumor types where 9p21 alterations are infrequent and where p16 is paradoxically overexpressed. CAI2 expression was associated with a poor outcome in neuroblastoma, suggesting value as a biomarker of tumor cell stage and patient outcome. Despite the strong correlation between CAI2 and p16 expression, CAI2 is independently regulated and is expressed in cell lines deleted or epigenetically silenced for p16, ARF and even p15. In response to serum deprivation, CAI2 levels rise rapidly in normal mononuclear cells, but slowly in tumor cell lines, suggesting that CAI2 is also a stress-response gene. CAI2 levels also rise in response to chemotherapeutic insult such as etoposide treatment. The NMB7 neuroblastoma cell line is one of very few neuroblastoma cell lines to express CAI2 at low levels. During passage, this cell line undergoes morphological changes, proliferates faster and exhibits an increase of more than 100-fold in CAI2 expression, though a concomitant decrease in Tyrosine Hydroxylase expression suggests the changes are not due to differentiation. Consistent with this, Retinoic Acid treatment, part of standard neuroblastoma therapeutic regimen known to induce neuroblastoma cell differentiation, slightly decreased CAI2 expression. As many lncRNAs regulate chromatin states, we considered epigenetic roles for CAI2 in gene regulation. RNA Immunoprecipitation revealed that CAI2 interacts with H3K27me3, a recruiter of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) that modulates chromatin structure and gene expression. As many advanced stage neuroblastomas and neuroblastoma cell lines highly express p16, we speculate that CAI2 binding to H3K27me3 may modulate chromatin structure and regulate expression at the 9p21 locus.']",

Homozygous deletion of this locus is among the most common genetic events in human cancer across tissues, with the resultant selective advantage to cancer cells generally attributed to the loss of CDKN2A proteins, which help maintain functional Rb and p53. However, in greater than 90% of cancer tissues harboring CDKN2A deletion, the adjacent CDKN2B gene encoding the p15 cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, is also deleted. The degree to which CDKN2B-encoded p15 loss contributes to human tumorigenesis is unclear. Here we show that CDKN2B is highly upregulated in common, benign melanocytic nevi (moles) expressing the constitutively active BRAF(V600E) oncogene. A large percentage of melanomas develop in continuity with these pre-existing nevi, suggesting that nevus melanocytes are not permanently senescent, and can serve as tumor-initiating cells upon acquisition of additional genetic changes. By examining primary melanocytes isolated directly from freshly excised benign human nevi, as well as normal primary melanocytes engineered to inducibly express BRAF(V600E), we link BRAF activation to a TGF-dependent p15 induction that arrests nevi in their pre-malignant state. We also use the primary nevus cells to establish a new genetically-defined, human in vivo melanoma xenograft model, which maximizes medical relevance by utilizing the naturally occurring melanoma precursor cells in a native 3-dimensional environment. With this approach, we show that p15 depletion in benign nevi promotes progression to melanoma, establishing the reversibility of nevus melanocyte growth arrest, and the functional importance of CDKN2B loss in human cancer.']",

Despite this uniform increase, we see a decrease in the age-related acquisition of a senescence phenotype in CR mice relative to control supporting the notion that CR is protective to this protumorigenic change that occurs with advancing age. Ongoing analysis of gene expression in DIO mice will determine the role of obesity in MFP cellular senescence and confirmation of senescent phenotypes via -galactosidase staining and analysis of SASP associated gene expression.']",

        "Background":"[\"Malignant mesothelioma (MMt) is a rare and very aggressive tumor of the mesothelium. It's most prevalent subtype is malignant pleural mesothelioma, eighty percent of which are associated with asbestos exposure. MMt incidence is 0.9 new cases per 100,000 persons per year. The five year relative survival is 7% overall, which positions MMt immediately above pancreatic cancer (6%), at the bottom of the survival list by cancer site.We applied a comprehensive molecular cytogenetic analysis using spectral karyotyping (SKY) and oligo aCGH to a panel of MMt cell lines. We found the largest set of recurrent and non-recurrent homozygous deletions (HD) for MMt (88 HDs in 17 cell lines; 52 recurrent HDs that fall into ten genomic areas). Detailed analysis of the most frequently homozygously deleted area located at 9p21.3 revealed that the main targets are CDKN2A/p14ARF (in 100% of the MM cell lines), CDKN2A/p16INK4A and CDKN2B /p15 (94% of cell lines). p14ARF seems to be the main target of HDs in the 9p21.3 area (deleted in all 17 MMt cell lines studied), followed by p16INK4A (deleted in 16 cell lines) indicating the inactivation of two major tumor suppressing pathways, p53 and Rb. Accordingly, mutations or HDs of p53 and Rb are infrequent events in MMt tumors. Other recurrent HDs were located at 9p21.2 (targeting LINGO2) and at16p13.3 (RBFOX1) in 41% of cell lines, 22q11.23 (GSTT1) in 29%, 22q12.2 (NF2) and 3q26 (no known genes) in 23% each, 8p11.22 -23 (ADAM5P/ADAM3A) in 18%, 3p21.3-p21.2 (RPL29), 3p21 (DUSP7), 4q22.1 (FAM190A) and 13q11-q12 (LATS2) in 12% each of the 17 MM cell lines While p16INK4A, p14ARF, p15, LATS2 and NF2 have been shown to behave as tumor suppressors in MMts, other genes in the HD areas presented here could be new tumor suppressor candidates.Structural chromosomal rearrangements were mainly non-reciprocal translocations (74% of aberrations detected by SKY) and deletions (23%). No recurrent balanced or unbalanced translocations have been found. Structural chromosomal rearrangements resulted in recurrent losses of fragments or whole chromosomal arms of 1p, 3p, 8p, 9p, 13q, 14q, 15q, 18q, 22q and gains of 1q, 5p, 7p, 8q, 17q, 20q. Small HDs were frequently embedded in the areas of focal losses. Integration of SKY and aCGH data allowed reconstruction of chromosomal rearrangements leading to the formation of HDs. Our data imply that only with acquisition of structural or numerical karyotypic abnormalities can MMt cells attain a complete loss of the 9p21.3 genomic area and loss of tumor suppressor genes located there. Tetraploidization seems to be a late event in the karyotypic progression of MMt cells, after HD in the 9p21.3 area has already been acquired.\"]",

While functional tests for determining the pathogenicity of missense germline mutations in the CDKN2A coding region have been developed, rare polymorphisms or sequence variants at the CDKN2A/ p16INK4a 5UTR, encountered during routine screening, are usually defined as variants with unknown significance after determining their frequency in control population and the cosegregation analysis in the family, when possible. We recently developed reporter assays to study a panel of p16INK4a 5UTR variants identified as heterozygous changes in patients from a hospital-based series of melanoma cases (c.-21C>T; c.-25C>T&c.-180G>A; c.-56G>T; c.-67G>C). Monocistronic as well as bicistronic luciferase-based reporter vectors were developed and used to test wild type and variant p16INK4a 5UTR activity upon transient transfection in melanoma-derived cells (WM266-4, G361 and SK-Mel-5) and in the breast cancer-derived MCF7 cells. Results revealed that the c.-21C>T variant had a strong negative impact on the reporter activity, similar to that of the known melanoma-predisposing mutation c.-34G>T, included as a control. The variants at 56 and at 25&-180 exhibited a milder impact, while results with c.-67G>C were dependent on the type of reporter vector. Quantification of the luciferase mRNA conducted in parallel with the luciferase assay indicated that the impact of the variants was mainly post-transcriptional. We also applied a polysomal profiling technique to measure allelic imbalance starting from heterozygous patient-derived cell lines and found that the c.-21C>T variant but also c.-56T>G and c.-67G>C exhibited lower association with the polysomes suggestive of reduced mRNA translation efficiency. A panel of eleven additional germline variants in the 5UTR of p16INK4a is being investigated. In particular we are focusing on the functional interactions between wild type and variant p16INK4a 5- and 3-UTR sequences and on the impact the variants can have on the targeting of the p16INK4a mRNA by microRNAs (including mir-346, -636, -639, -935) or RNA binding proteins (including YB-1).']",

        "Background":"['Homozygous knockout of p53 in mice leads to early mortality from lymphoma, with almost complete penetrance, thus hampering the study of other tumor histotypes related to p53. To ablate lymphoma development, we crossed p53 knockout mice with Rag2-/-;Il2rg-/- (RGKO) mice, which lack T, B and NK cells. We then compared the tumor spectrum of homozygous (p53-/-) and heterozygous (p53+/-) mice with those of mice lacking lymphocytes (RGKO-p53-/- and RGKO-p53+/-, respectively). All mice were of BALB/c genetic background. Lymphoma incidence in p53-/- mice exceeded 80%, whereas in RGKO-p53-/- it was near zero. The prevalent tumor of RGKO-p53-/- mice was hemangiosarcoma (incidence was about 60%in both sexes, median latency 19 weeks), other tumors included soft tissue sarcomas (incidence 10%), osteosarcomas and mammary carcinomas. Changes in tumor spectrum occurred also in p53 heterozygotes, in which lymphomas were relatively rare (<20%). Male RGKO-p53+/- had an increased incidence of hemangiosarcomas, reaching 25%, whereas females had an increased incidence of osteosarcomas, reaching 20%. The latter shared with human osteosarcoma the involvement of limbs and a high metastatic ability, in particular to the lungs. Molecular studies of tumors, in vitro cultured tumor cells and established cell lines showed specific alterations in the expression of p53-related genes (p16Ink4a, p19Arf, p15Ink4b, p21Cip1) and high expression levels of insulin-like growth factors and their receptors. In conclusion, genetic ablation of lymphoma in p53 knockout mice led to the development of new models of sarcoma development that can be now explored to study the development and metastatic spread of hemangiosarcoma and osteosarcoma.']",

        "Background":"['NADPH oxidase (Nox)-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a critical role in cell signaling, cell proliferation, and mitogenesis. We have previously shown that silencing NOX1 gene expression with siRNA decreases cell growth and angiogenesis in human HT-29 colon cancer xenografts. To investigate the mechanism of growth inhibition, we studied cell cycle and signaling pathways. We found using RT-PCR and Western analysis that the expression of the INK4 inhibitors (p15, p18, p19), as well as CDK6, phospho-Cyclin E, Cyclin E, and Cyclin D1 were all decreased when NOX1 was decreased by >80%. We detected important changes in the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway that were associated with NOX1 knockdown. Our stable knock-out cells (clone 6A) showed lower phosphorylation of Rac1, c-Raf, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, p90RSK and CREB. To understand this observation, we studied the activity of Tyr and Ser/Threonine protein phosphatases (PP) in our stable siRNA containing cells (6A) compared to stable scrambled siRNA containing cells (SA) and parental HT-29 cells. PTP1B activity was elevated (100.4+4.4 pmol of phosphate/min/g) in 6A cells compared to both SA (69.2+3.8) and parental (47.8+2.1) cell controls, P<0.05. Serine/Threonine protein phosphatases demonstrated a similar pattern; elevated in 6A cells (127.3+3.8 pmol of phosphate/min/g) versus both SA cells (91.7+2.1) and the parental line (88.9+1.9), P<0.05. To demonstrate that protein phosphatases play a key role in the regulation of ERK-CREB signaling, we used a c-Raf antibody to immunoprecipitate the c-Raf-PPs complex, and detected PTP1B and PP2C proteins by Western analysis. These data indicate that siRNA-mediated gene silencing of Nox1 deactivated ERK-CREB signaling, and that increased activity of protein phosphatases, that occur as a consequence of decreased Nox-mediated ROS formation, might play role in modifying the growth enhancing effects of the MAP kinase pathway in HT-29 colon cancer cells.']",

        "Background":"[\"The paralogous C-terminal binding proteins (collectively CtBP) 1 and 2 are evolutionarily conserved transcriptional co-regulators which demonstrate oncogene-like properties such as allowing for the progression of EMT and cellular invasion/migration, and supporting cellular survival through suppression of tumor suppressors (PTEN, p16, E-cadherin, BRCA-1) and pro-apoptotic genes (Bik, Puma, Noxa). Overexpression of CtBP is found in colon, ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers, and often correlates with loss of the tumor suppressors ARF and APC and with poorer prognosis for the patient. CtBP is also an emerging cancer drug target, encoding a dehydrogenase domain that can be targeted with small molecule inhibitors to kill cancer cells. CtBP appears to fit the criteria for a driver oncogene, though has never been fully characterized as such. To investigate the hypothesis that CtBP is a transforming oncogene, we subjected CtBP2 to multiple assays for cellular oncogenic activity including loss of contact inhibition, invasion, and anchorage independent growth. Previously immortalized NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts expressing CtBP2 or mutant H-Ras as a positive control were analyzed for focus formation, Matrigel-invasion, and soft agar colony formation. Consistent with the hypothesis that CtBP exhibits properties of an oncogene, CtBP2 potently induced focus formation, Matrigel-invasion, and soft agar colony formation with similar potency to oncogenic mutant H-Ras. Moreover, CtBP2 cooperated with the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein but not H-Ras to transform primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Taken together, the 3T3 and MEF transformation data suggest CtBP2 acts as a Ras-like oncogene in rodent cell transformation assays. Previous research from our lab has shown that CtBP's ability to induce migration in HCT116 cells depends in part on its activation of T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (Tiam1). Work is ongoing to characterize critical downstream targets for CtBP's transforming activity. Targeting CtBP and its dehydrogenase domain in cancers where the protein is found to be overexpressed, or where its regulators, ARF and APC are found to be inactive, could lead to a therapeutic approach specific for an emerging driver oncogene.\"]",

Circulating tumor DNA in serum/plasma has been demonstrated to reflect the biological characteristics of tumors. Recently, the presence of gene promoter methylation in serum/plasma DNA has also been demonstrated in patients with cancers of lung, head and neck, liver, and breast. So, in the present study, we attempted to determine the feasibility and the clinical correlations of detecting tumor-associated aberrant methylation in the serum/plasma of patients with gastric cancer. Materials and Methods', ' We examined promoter methylation of 6 genes using methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM) in paired serum, plasma and tumor samples of 50 gastric cancer patients. The tumor and the paired serum/plasma were investigated for aberrant methylation in BLU, DAPK1, GADD45G, MGMT, p15 and p16. The sensitivity of the HRM analysis was tested by using dilutions of fully methylated DNA into unmethylated DNA. Results', ' MSP was used to assess gene methylation in tumor samples. Promoter methylation in BLU, DAPK1, GADD45G, MGMT, p15, and p16 were detected in 47%, 37%, 59%, 32%, 14%, and 43% of tumor tissues by MSP. MS-HRM was used to assess gene methylation in serum/plasma samples concurrently. In the serum/plasma of gastric cancer patients, BLU, DAPK1, GADD45G, MGMT, p15, and p16 were methylated at frequencies of 26%, 21%, 23%, 11%, 9%, and 17%, respectively. Nineteen (38%) gastric tumor samples displayed concurrent methylation in three or more tumor genes. Aberrant methylation in one or more genes was found in 74% (37/50) serum samples and 70% (35/50) plasma samples. However, there was not a significant relationship of gene methylation between gastric tumor tissues and serum/plasma samples.Conclusion', ' These results suggest that aberrant promoter methylation in serum/plasma can be detected in a substantial proportion of gastric cancer patients. Detection of DNA methylation in serum/plasma may be a biomarker for early detection of gastric cancer. MS-HRM is powerful technique for the analysis of promoter methylation.

Using both genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) models and human xenograft models of MIBC, we demonstrate that tumors expressing ARF display poor response to treatment with the platinum-based chemotherapy agent cisplatin. This is mediated in part by expression of the integrin-binding protein ITGB3BP (CENPR) and reflects ARF-dependent inhibition of protein translation, which is attenuated by drug treatment.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumorigenesis induced by human papillomavirus (HPV) shows a greater clinical response to radiation therapy when compared to HPV negative patients. The underlying mechanism for this more favorable outcome is unknown, but the presumption is that DNA repair response must play a large role. P16INK4a is a known surrogate marker for HPV positivity; however the relationship between radiation sensitivity and P16INK4a has not been completely elucidated in this context. Ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7), also known as HAUSP, is a deubiquitylating enzyme that cleaves ubiquitin from substrates to stabilize target proteins. USP7 overexpression is a predictor of poor prognosis in lung carcinomas and correlates with disease progression and lower survival in gliomas. More recent studies have shown USP7 has a role in the stability of DNA damage response proteins such as RNF168, BRCA1 and Chk1; and USP7 knockdown has been shown to radio-sensitize breast cancer cells to radiation. We have investigated the possible role of USP7 in the radio-response of HNSCC cells in the context of HPV status.Methods', ' Four HPV(+) and four HPV(-) HNSCC were chosen for this study. The radio-response was determined by clonogenic survival assay. P16INK4a overexpression was generated using lentivirus. Western blot analysis was used for visualizing protein expression. The Cancer Genome Atlas was interrogated to examine the relationship between USP7 and clinical outcome.Results', ' Our data suggest P16INK4a negatively regulates USP7 and leads to the more radiosensitive phenotype associated with HPV(+)HNSCC. Radio-resistant HPV(-) HNSCC cell lines show higher levels of USP7 than HPV(+) lines and over-expression of P16INK4a in HPV(-) HN5 cells leads to down-regulation of USP7 and radio-sensitization. Conversely, P16INK4a siRNA knockdown in HPV(+) UMSCC-47 shows an increase of USP7 protein expression and radio-resistance. P22077, an inhibitor of USP7 activity, was also shown to radiosensitize a HPV(-) cell line. This shows proof of principle that inhibiting USP7 can be a viable approach to sensitizing HPV(-) HNSCC to radiation. USP7 overexpression was also associated with poorer overall survival in HNSCC.Conclusion', ' These results suggest that USP7 may be a marker of clinical radioresistance in HNSCC and that its inhibition has the potential to improve the treatment outcome of patients with HPV(-) HNSCC when combined with radiotherapy.']",

        "Background":"['BMI-1, which is one of the core components of polycomb repressive complex 1, is frequently found deregulated in patients with hematological disorders. In last decades, researchers concordantly agree that BMI-1 mediates tumorigenesis of leukemia stem cells through p16INK4A leukemogenic pathway. However, accumulating evidences contradict the idea that BMI-1 solely plays an oncogenic role in tumorigenesis. It has been shown BMI-1 depletion favors the development of myelofibrosis in mice; whereas high BMI-1 expression suppressed colony forming ability of MLL-ENL-transformed bone marrow and correlated with higher survival in some cancers. In this study, we hypothesized that BMI-1 plays a tumor suppressive role, which is independent of the regulation of INK4A-ARF locus, in human leukemia. BMI-1 was over-expressed in a panel of myeloid and lymphoid lineage leukemia cells, including HL-60, MV4-11, MonoMac-6, SEM, Nalm-20 and RS4;11. We observed no deregulation of p16INK4A and p14ARF genes by BMI-1, suggesting the regulation of INK4A-ARF locus is independent of BMI-1 modulation in leukemia cells. Nevertheless, over-expression of BMI-1 resulted in significant reduction of leukemia cell proliferation. It is noted that constitutively active JAK-STAT signaling pathway is crucial to leukemia cell survival. By modulation of BMI-1 level, we demonstrated suppression of the activated JAK-STAT signaling pathway in most of the leukemia cell lines with the exception of MonoMac-6 and RS4;11. This is in agreement with the high sensitivity to ruxolitinib, a JAK-STAT inhibitor, in all the tested leukemia cell lines except RS4;11. Importantly, we showed that BMI-1 over-expression could sensitize RS4;11 cells to reduce cell proliferation under ruxolitinib treatment. These results suggest that higher efficacy of ruxolitinib treatment could be achieved under a condition of high cellular level of BMI-1. We further demonstrated that ruxolitinib treatment was more effective in a cohort of AML patient samples (n = 25) with a context of higher BMI-1 expression (p < 0.05). Altogether, our results suggest that BMI-1 functions as a tumor suppressor gene via inhibition of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The endogenous level of BMI-1 could be served as an indicator for the effective treatment of JAK-STAT-dependent leukemia cells using ruxolitinib.']",

        "Background":"['Ovarian cancer is the most lethal of gynecological cancers being the fifth leading cause of cancer-associated deaths. Reduced expression or loss of lamin A/C has been demonstrated in 47% of ovarian cancers, as well. Lamins A and C are intermediate filament proteins and are major components of the nuclear lamina that provide structure to the nucleus. Mutations in lamins A/ C are the source of several nuclear envelope diseases, namely laminopathies, such as muscular dystrophy. Interestingly, data acquired from research on laminopathy patient samples, as well as from in vitro, and in vivo murine models have revealed that tissue affected by lamin A/C mutations display characteristics similar to neoplastic or malignant cells, such as defective nuclear architecture and changes in ploidy. Further, reduced expression or loss of lamin A/C has been demonstrated in ovarian, breast, and small-cell lung cancers, and has been associated with poor outcome in gastric carcinomas and hematologic malignancies. We previously found that siRNA suppression of lamin A/C in human ovarian surface epithelial cells results in deformed nuclear morphology, p21 induction, decreased mitosis, delayed cell growth, and aneuploidy. Accordingly, we currently investigated how concomitant loss of lamin A/C and p53 (LAC/p53 KO) affect the cell cycle and chromosome content in germ line LAC/p53 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) through western blotting and flow cytometry. We found that that in nonsynchronized early and late passage LAC/p53 KO MEFs cell cycle inhibitors p16 and p19, as well as pRB, cyclin D1, and PCNA expression is upregulated compared to the lamin A/C knockout and wild type controls. Surprisingly, this expression pattern is also observed under serum-starved conditions. Cyclin D1, PCNA, and pRB expression is also substantially upregulated in late passage MEFs. Further, early and late passage LAC/p53 KO MEFs possess a considerably larger mitotic and aneuploid cell population than the controls. As lamin A/C is a fundamental structural nuclear protein, it is hypothesized that lamin A/C knockout MEFs display reduced mitosis and hindered cell growth to prevent malignancy. Additional loss of a functional cell cycle, and checkpoint protein like p53, may reverse the initial phenotype to promote tumorigenesis, particularly if chromosomal instability is already established. Our experimental results support the ideas that loss of lamin A/C protein is synergistic with p53 inactivation in promoting cell cycle progression and chromosomal instability to potentially induce tumorigenesis. The mechanism of the aforementioned findings and the potential to induce ovarian tumorigenesis are under further investigation in vivo.']",

        "Background":"['Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are the most common cancer among people of European ancestry. Aberrant activation of hedgehog (HH) signaling plays a pivotal role in BCC carcinogenesis. Besides mutations in genes encoding HH pathway components, mutations in the p53 gene frequently are found in human BCCs. Consistently, our previous studies have found that the loss of p53 can dramatically accelerate BCC formation in ionizing radiation (IR)-treated Ptch1+/- mice. It remains elusive how p53 is activated in BCC development. DNA damage response (DDR) and oncogenic induced stress (OIS) are two essentially independent pathways leading to p53 activation although limited evidence suggests crosstalk between these pathways. In response to OIS, ARF is activated and leads to p53 activation, functioning as a tumor suppressor, in many cancers. However, the loss of ARF, unlike loss of p53, failed to affect the development of medulloblastoma in Ptch1+/- mice (Wetmore C., et al, 2001). In the present study, we investigated whether ARF affects BCC development in the same mice.To address this, we bred ARFGFP/GFP mice, in which ARF function is disabled and GFP is expressed under the control of the endogenous ARF promoter, with our Ptch1+/- mice to generate Ptch1+/- ARFGFP/GFP (designated as ARF mice) for comparison with Ptch1+/- K14CreER2 p53fl/fl (PF) mice. Following our standard protocol of tamoxifen injection at age 7.5 weeks to delete p53 specifically in K14-expressing keratinocytes (for PF mice) and treating both ARF and PF mice with ionizing radiation at age 8 weeks, we compared BCC development between the above 2 lines.We find that at age 5 months, ARF mice formed numbers of microscopic BCCs comparable to those in PF mice though the latter exhibited greater mouse-to-mouse variation. More importantly, both mouse lines developed initial visible BCCs at age 5 to 7 months, which is dramatically earlier than the age 9 to 18 months for the Ptch1+/- mice (ARF+/+ and p53+/+). In addition, ARFGFP/GFP mice responded to IR-induced DNA damage in a pattern essentially similar to ARF+/+ mice, indicating an intact DDR pathway as reported in the literature.In conclusion, our data demonstrate that ARF is involved in BCC carcinogenesis as a tumor suppressor, probably playing the major, perhaps the exclusive, role in activating p53 in this process.']",

This resistance can be caused by alterations in Trp53 itself or p19Arf loss and the reduced anti-tumor immune response may be caused by loss of interferon- (IFN), an important immune-stimulatory cytokine. Here, we investigate the impact of p19Arf and IFN gene transfer in melanoma cells with regards to the expression profile of genes responsible for the induction of cell death. Recombinant adenoviral vectors with a p53-responsive promoter (PG) driving expression of p19Arf or IFN were applied alone or in combination in B16F10 cells in vitro (mouse melanoma, p53 wt). Cell death was evaluated by annexin/PI staining and MTT assays. LC3B expression was verified by western blot analysis of cells extracts. Caspase-3 activity was evaluated using a lentiviral vector which constitutively expressing luciferase protein linked to an ubiquitin site that can be cleaved by caspase-3. RNA expression profile was evaluated by microarray analysis of treated samples and validation of gene expression was performed by real-time PCR. We verified that combined gene transfer of p19Arf and IFN resulted in 74% hypodiploid cells whereas single gene transfer yielded only half of this number, as shown by cell cycle and MTT analysis. Although there was a high rate of cell death, only 25% of cells were stained for annexin/PI and activation of caspase-3 was reduced in cells treated with p19Arf and IFN combination compared to treatment of p19Arf alone. Also, there was no increase in LC3B expression when cells were treated with the p19Arf and IFN combination. These observations suggest that B16F10 cells are dying by other mechanisms rather than apoptosis or autophagy. Transduced cells were analyzed for gene expression profile and critical genes were selected for validation. Combination of p19Arf and IFN transduction in B16F10 cells revealed a synergistic effect modifying exclusively the expression of 1054 genes involved in cell death, immune system activation and cell cycle arrest. There was an increase of 4-20 fold in expression of MDM2, p53, p21Waf1, PUMA, MDM4, FOXO1, NR3C1, PHLDA3, RANBP9 and WDR46, and also an increase of 400-fold in p73 expression in cells treated with p19Arf and IFN combination. Conclusions', ' The use of p53-responsive vectors to express p19Arf and IFN promotes complementation of the p53/Arf and IFN pathways, resulting in a synergistic gene regulation of many essential functions in cancer cells, destabilizing cell cycle and cell organization in general, while promoting expression of genes related to cell death. As p73 is a transcription factor of caspase-1 expression, we hypothesize that this could be the major participant involved in death of these cells.Financial support', ' 2011/10656-5, 2011/50911-4 and 2013/25167-5 (FAPESP).']",

        "Background":"['Recent health surveys have revealed that green tea is one of the most commonly consumed natural products among breast cancer survivors. Although breast cancer survival has increased during the past two decades due to adjuvant endocrine therapy with antiestrogens (AE) such as Tamoxifen (TAM) and Faslodex (FAS) the risk of acquired endocrine-resistance still persists for many women. This can be mimicked by a prolonged culture of breast cancer cells with sequentially increasing concentrations of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4OHT; 1 nM -1 M), applying a selection pressure for cells to acquire resistance to 4OHT. Such cells maintain their resistant phenotype even after removal of the pressure (Brunner et al., 1993). The aim of this study was to determine whether a green tea polyphenol (EGCG) can affect the development of TAM-resistance in breast cancer. We tested the efficacy of EGCG, in this long-term [LT] cell culture model. Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 cells (n=2/group) were cultured in media containing', \" i) Vehicle (0.01% EtOH;, LT-V); ii) LT-4OHT (1 nM to 1 M; increasing every 3rd passage; LT-4OHT); or iii) 4OHT (1 nM to 1 M) + EGCG (100 nM;single dose;LT-EGCG). Growth rate was recorded for each passage (P), measured as the time required reach confluence (70%), after which the cells were subcultured. We will present results of this LT study including mechanisms by which EGCG may alter resistance-development, focusing on signaling pathways such as ER, NFkB and unfolded protein response (UPR) known to be involved in endocrine resistance. During the initial passages (P1-P6; [4OHT]  5 nM) the cells grew at the same rate regardless of the treatment. Starting at P8, time to confluence was delayed for LT-4OHT ([10 nM]; 7d) compared to the LT-V. This delay was even more pronounced at P15 ([100 nM];  21d), suggesting that cells were under a growth inhibition/selection pressure. The growth rate of LT-EGCG did not differ from LT-4OHT prior to P15, but in subsequent passages a delay was evident (14 to 18 d). To test whether the cells maintained their (delayed growth) phenotype, they were first cultured in regular media for 24h and tested for growth inhibition by 4OHT (1 nM-1M) and FAS (100 nM). LT-V cells (P27) were more susceptible to the inhibitory effects of 1 M 4OHT (73  11% versus 0 M 4OHT) than LT-4OHT cells (P19; 105  40%), confirming the development of resistance in LT-4OHT cells. In contrast, LT-EGCG cells had retained their sensitivity to 4OHT, similar to LT-V (P19; 75  8%). All treatment groups were equally responsive to FAS (30%). These results suggest that EGCG may delay the development of a 4OHT-resistance in breast cancer cells. It will be confirmed whether the effect prevails after removal of selection pressure (4OHT). This data will provide a better understanding of green tea's potential to prevent TAM-resistance in breast cancer patients.\"]",

Our previous studies demonstrated that miR-125b directly targets p53, Puma and Bak1 in human prostate cancer (CaP). To further elucidate the role of miR-125b in modulating the p53 network, we utilized a bioinformatics approach to identify miR-125b-regulated, CaP-relevant tumor suppressor gene, and identified p14ARF gene as a miR-125b target. We first evaluated the effect of miR-125b on the regulation of p14ARF expression, and found that miR-125b treatment induced reduction of p14ARF by 80% in LNCaP CaP cells and 60% in 22Rv1 CaP cells. Conversely, anti-miR-125b increased the p14ARF level by 40% in LNCaP and 30% in 22Rv1. We then performed luciferase assay to validate that the miR-125b binding site in the 3UTR of p14ARF mRNA is responsible for the regulation of p14ARF by miR-125b. Since p14ARF accelerates Mdm2 degradation, resulting in p53 up-regulation, we thus assessed the effect of miR-125b on the expression of Mdm2 and p53. Compared with miRNA control, miR-125b treatment induced a dramatic increase in Mdm2 and a significant reduction of p53 in CaP cell lines, as well as in miR-125b-overexpressed xenograft tumor. Additionally, miR-125b treatment resulted in a reduction of interaction between p14ARF and Mdm2. Next, we examined the effect of miR-125b on CaP cell proliferation. Both LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells were transfected with miR-125b and cell proliferation was determined by clone formation assay. When compared with the control, miR-125b treatment increased clonogenic survival of CaP cells, while anti-miR-125b caused a dramatic reduction in the number of colonies. We evaluated the effect of downregulation of miR-125b on apoptosis in p53-positive 22Rv1 CaP cells. Data from TUNEL assay demonstrated that anti-miR-125 caused 63% of cells to undergo apoptosis. Similarly, in p53-negative PC3 CaP cells, miR-125b treatment induced a 2-fold increase in survival, while anti-miR-125b caused 50% of cells to undergo apoptosis. In summary, we observed that overexpression of miR-125b negatively regulates the expression of p14ARF, resulting in promotion of cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivation of miR-125b using anti-miR-125b affects apoptosis involving both p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways. Therefore, our data suggest that miR-125b has a great potential to be used as a therapeutic target for CaP treatment.']",

        "Background":"['Patients with advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) have extremely limited treatment options. To develop targeted therapies necessary to radically alter the clinical course of MPM, it is important to identify oncogenic mutations and signaling pathways that drive its development and progression. About 75% of MPMs carry inactivating mutations at the NF2 locus, which encodes the FERM domain protein Merlin, and often also have deletions of the CDKN2A locus, encoding the CDK inhibitor p16 and the p53 activator ARF. Since traditional cancer therapies target dysregulated oncogenes, it is important to elucidate the pathogenically relevant proteins that are dysregulated downstream of MPM tumor suppressors. We have developed a flexible and rapid mouse model that can be used to dissect genetics of MPM, to evaluate the preclinical efficacy of novel therapies, and to provide a platform for MPM shRNA genetic screens. We injected into the pleural cavity of mice lentivirus encoding Cre recombinase and miR30-based shRNA cassettes to simultaneously deplete four of the most commonly lost proteins in mesothelioma - Nf2, p16INK4a/ARF, and BAP1. Cre recombinase deletes the Nf2 conditional allele and simultaneously activates a Luciferase reporter gene in the pleural mesothelium, allowing for bioluminescent imaging of infected cells that develop MPM tumors. Lentiviral miR30-based shRNA cassettes simultaneously deplete Ink4a/ARF and Bap1, helping to drive tumorigenesis. To evaluate MPM genetics, mice with conditional alleles for putative drivers of MPM pathogenesis (i.e. Dcaf1 and Ptk2) in addition to the Nf2 conditional allele can be injected with the virus to determine whether these genes are necessary and sufficient for MPM development or progression. Moreover, knockdown of putative MPM drivers can be easily carried out by adding corresponding shRNA cassettes to the lentiviral vector. Using these methods, we have developed a rapid genetically engineered mouse model that recapitulates human MPM and can be used to explore MPM genetics. This flexible MPM mouse model will allow us to unravel MPM genetics and help to identify novel therapeutic targets as well as provide an efficient preclinical test of these therapies.']",

We first calculated centroids for each of the three metastases types (CLM, BCM and MLM) and then calculated the Euclidean distance between centroids to get a measure of how similar or different each cancer type is for that particular pathway. The findings were compared to the corresponding primary cancer types and normal tissue available from TCGA to uncover biological processes specific to metastases. The pathways were functionally classified into genetic information processing, cellular processes, environmental information processing and metabolic pathways as per KEGG database. Across metastases from different cancer types, pathways involved in genetic information processing (e.g. translation, transcription, protein folding and degradation, DNA replication and repair) and metabolic pathways were more similar than the pathways involved in cellular processes (e.g. cell-cycle, apoptosis, adherence junction), and signal transduction pathways (e.g. Notch, MTOR, JAK STAT) responsible for environmental information processing. The genetic information processing pathways were more similar across cancer types also in the primary setting than the pathways involved in cellular and environmental information processing, whereas the metabolic pathways were more similar across cancer types in the metastatic setting compared to the primary setting. Preliminary findings suggest that the basic molecular architecture of the primary tumors is maintained, except for the metabolic pathways, which become more similar in the metastatic setting; and hence may be a common denominator across cancer types during metastatic process.']",

Loss of p16 expression occurs in many cancers including breast cancer. Our studies showed that, by ectopic expression via adenoviral-mediated gene transfer, p16 downregulates VEGF gene expression by neutralizing the transactivation of HIF-1, and suppresses breast cancer angiogenesis and metastasis. To investigate whether p16 directly affects one or more aspects of the metastatic cascade, MDA-MB-231 cells infected with lentivirus expressing Tet-on inducible p16 were used to study the p16 effects on growth, adhesion and migration of the breast cancer cells. We found that p16 inhibits MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation (45.6% inhibition) and hypoxia-induced cell migration (36% inhibition), but has no apparent effect on cell adhesion. The p16-mediated inhibition of hypoxia-induced cell migration parallels with p16s inhibition of HIF-1 transactivation activity.

Physicians depend on surgery, cytotoxic adjuvant chemotherapy, or radiation for treatment of breast cancer patients. Few novel therapies are approved for clinical use. Although existing therapies are effective in controling the disease in many patients, the cytotoxic side-effects make them limited. This is especially the case in the patients with early stage breast cancer whose prognosis with surgery alone is good and avoiding adjuvant chemotherapy would spare them toxic side effects. On the other hand, significant fraction of patients relapses and develops metastasis. Therefore, it is critical to identify markers for better breast cancer patient stratification based on their prognosis that would guide physicians in selection and aggressiveness of therapies. Recently, we linked transcription factor DMP1 (cyclin D binding protein 1, Dmtf1) as a critical tumor suppressor that blocks proliferative signals from ErbB2 and oncogenic Ras by activating p14Arf-p53 pathway. hDMP1 is hemizygously deleted in 50% of human breast tumors that retain wild-type ARF and p53. In this study we identified an upstream kinase, MEKK1, which cooperates with Dmp1 to activate Arf transcription. In constitutively active form (C-terminal kinase domain or CA-MEKK1), MEKK1 increased transcriptional activity of Dmp1 via direct phosphorylation, while the full length (regulatory and kinase domain) form behaved as a feedback inhibitor by increasing Dmp1 ubiquitination. Phosphorylation sites on DMP1 that increase its transcriptional activity were mapped to the C-terminal transactivation domain. Expression of CA-MEKK1 in breast cancer cell lines activated endogenous Arf-p53 pathway. hMEKK1 is located on human 5q11 chromosome, a locus frequently deleted in breast and lung cancer. Since MEKK1 appeared to be an activator of p53 tumor suppressor pathway, we wondered if MEKK1 is involved in human cancer. Using DNA from breast cancer patient tumors and matched normal tissue, we analyzed hMEKK1 gene deletion using specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) primers. MEKK1 was found hemizygously deleted in 20% of patients. Immunohistochemistry confirmed reduction of MEKK1 protein intensity to LOH(+) compared to LOH (-) patients. In the independent cohort of breast cancer patients, we show that low MEKK1 mRNA expression is associated with adverse outcome. Here we show that constitutively active MEKK1 is a novel activator of Dmp1-Arf-p53 pathway via Dmp1 phosphorylation. The MEKK1 gene was frequently deleted in breast tumor tissue and its expression was correlated with disease outcome. Overall, MEKK1 is a potential prognostic/predictive indicator for breast cancer and could be used by physicians to better stratify patients.']",

The ability of LZAP to regulate p53 in the absence of ARF has been largely unexplored. Here, we show that LZAP depletion diminished expression of mutant and wild-type p53 protein. LZAP activity toward p53 was independent of ARF and the known p53 regulators, Wip1 and HDM2. Loss of LZAP decreased p53 translation and destabilized p53 protein due, at least partially, to increased nucleolin expression. Knockdown of LZAP abrogated p53 stabilization induced by ionizing radiation, and LZAP depletion protected wild-type p53 cells from radiation or chemotherapeutic agents, while rendering cells expressing mutant or no p53 more sensitive. In human HNSCC, LZAP levels correlated with p53 levels, and remarkably, tumors with low LZ were less likely to have p53 mutations. These data suggest that loss of LZAP represents a novel mechanism of p53 inactivation in human cancer.

        "Background":"['Colitis associated cancer (CAC) is a deadly complication of inflammatory bowel disease, and a subtype of colon cancer. CAC malignancy progresses through enhanced DNA damage. Observance of microsatellite instability and chromosomal instability in non-cancer related inflammatory conditions, supports the fact that inflammation could contribute to genomic destabilization by generating reactive oxygen nitrogen species, producing double strand breaks leading to DNA damage. Thus chronic colitis can induce DNA damage and modulate DNA repair systems- components of the intrinsic pathway to modulate tumor microenvironment. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are the most prominent family of proteinases associated with almost all the junctures of inflammation and tumorigenesis. They mediate inflammation, tissue remodeling, invasion, metastasis and tumor growth. Among the 24 known human MMPs, MMP9 is very unique as it is undetectable in normal tissues but highly expressed in inflamed or ulcerated tissues. We have observed that MMP9 has a protective role in CAC, which is exclusive and contrary to its traditional role of a facilitator in acute inflammation and sporadic colon cancer. In this study we explore the molecular mechanism by which MMP9 prevents DNA damage by activating tumor suppressors and DNA repair pathways in CAC. We generated transgenic mice overexpressing MMP9 in intestinal epithelium (TgM9) and to mimic human CAC, 3 cycles of 3% DSS (dextran sodium sulfate, a colonic inflammation inducer) for 5 days, followed by two weeks of recovery was used for in vivo model. Stably-transfected HCT116 cells with/without p-EGFP-MMP9 plasmid were used for in vitro experiments. We have observed that in CAC, TgM9 mice had significantly decreased tumor incidence and dysplastic lesions and a lower histological score compared to their WT littermates. TgM9 mice exhibited increased apoptosis, protein expressions of active-Notch1, p19ARF, p53, p21WAF1/Cip1, caspase-3 and cyclinE in CAC compared to WTs. HCT116-cells overexpressing MMP9 indicated decreased cell proliferation. FACS analysis indicated S-phase cell-cycle arrest and WB analysis of phosphorylated gamma-H2AX expressions indicated less DSBs compared to vector. HCT116 cells overexpressing MMP9 indicated increased expression of MDC1 and mis-match repair proteins MLH1. Our study highlights two novel findings i) MMP9 being a secretory protein activates transcellular protein Notch1 which translocates to nucleus and activates wildtype p53 via ARF and ii) MMP9 suppresses DNA double strand breaks by activating MMR gene- MLH1 and removing the damaged cells by apoptosis and or cell cycle arrest. Our study highlights the paradox of using MMP9 inhibitors in current therapies to treat CAC patients, implying that MMP9 expression might be a natural/ biological way to suppress inflammation associated ulceration.']",

It includes conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Although confined to ocular surface, they have capability to recur (5-53%), metastasize (0-16%) and even cause death (8%).One of the most important issues still unresolved in the treatment and management of OSSN is the inability to determine factors causing disease progression. Identification of reliable biomarkers which could detect progression as well as identify high risk cases is an urgent necessity. The Cyclin D1/p16INK4a/pRb pathway plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and alterations in these proteins have been reported in various malignancies.This study was designed to explore the status of pRb, p16INK4a and cyclin D1 in various clinical stages of OSSN patients.Methods', 'Sixty-four histopathologically confirmed OSSN cases (44 squamous cell carcinomas and 20 conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasias) were included in this study.

Immunohistochemical expression of total pRb (clone-13A10), phosphorylated Rb (clone-Phospho-Ser780), p16INK4a (clone-6H12), and cyclin D1 (clone-SP4) protein was evaluated. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analysis was done to assess the prognostic significance of these proteins.Results', ' Immunoexpression of the targeted proteins demonstrated loss /inactive form of pRb in 87% OSSN cases, p16INK4a and cyclin D1 overexpression in 28% in 63% cases respectively. From T1 to T3 AJCC category there was a progressive increase of p16INK4a (0%in T1 to 100% in T3) (P = 0.007) and cyclin D1 overexpression (25% in T1 to 88% in T4).

High expression of Aurora A has been shown in patients with breast, lung, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and gynecological cancers. The Aurora kinases are known to promote tumor formation and progression, which has led investigators to develop multiple inhibitors of Aurora kinases for clinical use. The expression of Aurora-A kinase in head and neck cancers is not well understood. We assessed the overall survival (OS) for a cohort of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) based upon Aurora-A and phospho-Aurora-A kinase expression (reflecting active Aurora-A). We also related this to SCCHN subtype, using p16 expression as a surrogate for human papillomavirus association, because of the recognition that p16 + cancers have far superior prognosis. Methods', ' Tumor tissue from 89 patients with SCCHN operated on at the Fox Chase Cancer Center was analyzed for Aurora-A and phospho-Aurora-A expression.

Stat3 inhibition induces expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. On the other hand, it has been shown that oncogene inactivation induces cellular senescence and the secretion of senescence-associated secretome (SAS) in diverse tumor types. We recently described that Stat3 blockade leads to a senescence program in murine BC cells, which is accompanied by the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, we demonstrated that immunization of mice with syngeneic Stat3 blocked BC cells induces an antitumoral immune response that involves the participation of CD4+ Th cells and cytotoxic NK cells. In this study our objectives were to study whether immunization with supernatants (SN) produced by Stat3-blocked cells induces an antitumor immune response and to explore the contribution of senescence phenotype in this response. For that purpose we used BC models of ErbB-2-positive, JIMT-1 and KPL-4 cells (human) and C4HD cells (murine), and of triple negative, MDA-MB231 cells (human) and 4T1 cell (murine). Knockdown of Stat3 with siRNA in these cells, induced senescence (assessed by acidic -galactosidase staining). In human BC cells the senescent phenotype was accompanied by up-regulation of p21cip1 and downregulation of Rb expressions. In mouse BC cells we observed an increased expression of p16ink4a. In addition, simultaneous transfection with siRNAs targeting Stat3 and p16ink4a reverted the senescent phenotype. Then, we used a pre-clinical model in which we embedded the SN of C4HD cells in a slow-delivery depot as an adjuvant of a cellular immunotherapy. We immunized the animals with irradiated C4HD cells together with a depot containing lyophilized SN of C4HD cells transfected in vitro either with Stat3 siRNA (senescent) and Stat3 and p16ink4a siRNA (non-senescent), or a control siRNA. After 3 immunizations, with 15 d of interval between them, animals were challenged with C4HD tumor and tumor growth was monitored for 40 d. We observed that immunization with SN of cells with Stat3 siRNA decreased tumor growth vs. control siRNA group. Interestingly, there was no difference between tumor growth of animals immunized with SN of cells with Stat3 siRNA vs Stat3 and p16ink4a siRNA. We observed in these two groups greater cytotoxic activity of NK cells and an increase in the number of memory CD4+ T cells vs. control.These results suggest that Stat3 blockade drives a senescence program also in human BC cells. The secretome of Stat3-blocked BC cells is an effective adjuvant and could be formulated for immunotherapies independently of the SAS.

Our results showed that expression of PR, HER2, Ki-67 and p16 varied significantly in DCIS lesions from a single patient (P < 0.05 for PR; P < 1  10-8 for HER2, Ki-67 and p16). In addition, seventy-two percent of the individuals had heterogeneous expression in at least 2/6 markers (P < 10-18, vs. hypothesized homogeneity baseline, 10%). Importantly, by comparing the expression of promising DCIS risk biomarkers (Ki-67, p53 and p16) among different DCIS subgroups, we found that DCIS lesions in subgroup IIb, which had the same molecular subtypes as the adjacent IDC but not the same subtypes as the adjacent TDLU, had a higher Ki-67 index (P < 10-7), a higher chance of positive p53 staining (P = 0.02), and less p16 staining (P = 0.08) than those in type I DCIS lesions with different molecular subtypes from the adjacent IDC. Further molecular characterization by microarray analysis identified that 246 annotated coding and non-coding genes were differentially expressed between DCIS subgroups Type I and IIb [FC (fold change)>2.0, P<0.05]. A majority of genes were upregulated in type IIb DCIS and more than 50% of genes are cancer-relevant (P < 10-8-2). Importantly, a group of differentially expressed genes in subgroup IIb including CD44, IFIT1, STAT1, MLH1, PARP9 and BRIP1 were confirmed by qPCR validation and likely play important roles in DCIS progression based on previous findings, which further support that Type IIb DCIS may represent a highly aggressive subgroup.Conclusions', ' By using a systematic approach, our results clearly demonstrate that intra-individual heterogeneity in DCIS is very common in patients concurrently diagnosed with IDC. Our novel findings of a DCIS subpopulation with high-aggressiveness will provide a new paradigm for mechanistic studies of breast tumor progression and also have broad implications for prevention research as heterogeneous pre-invasive lesions are present in many other cancer types.This work was kindly supported by the Susan G.

        "Background":"['Nuclear interactor of ARF and Mdm2, NIAM, is a novel regulator of the ARF-Mdm2-p53 tumor suppressor pathway. It collaborates with ARF, promotes p53 transcriptional activity, and is negatively regulated by Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and proteasome degradation. How NIAM activates p53 is not known, however its ability to do so in ARF-null cells reveals it is an ARF-independent process. Our preliminary data suggest that NIAM could activate p53 by either competing Mdm2 away from p53-Mdm2 complexes and/or by inducing lysine 120 acetylation of p53 via the Tip60 acetyltransferase. p53 acetylation at K120 is known to be regulated by two different histone acetyltransferases, Tip60 and MOF, and to promote the specific upregulation of apoptotic genes by p53. Our preliminary data show that NIAM interacts with Tip60 and strongly promotes p53 acetylation of K120, suggesting a functional NIAM-Tip60 interaction in vivo. Tip60 is an established chromatin modifying protein that influences chromatin structure and cancer gene expression. Consistent with these characteristics of Tip60, we discovered that NIAM is a chromatin-associated protein that binds to transcriptionally active regions of the genome. Other findings connect Tip60 and NIAM. Tip60 acts through p53, ARF and Myc to control transcription and promote the DNA damage checkpoint response. We found that NIAM, like Tip60, localizes to sites of DNA repair in response to DNA damage and it is already established that the absence of either protein leads to chromosomal instability. These compelling observations link NIAM with chromatin regulation and DNA damage repair, potentially via Tip60 signaling, all of which are important for the maintenance of chromosomal stability and prevention of cancer.']",

However, SET action in gene expression is unknown, so we assessed SET role in the control of epigenetic modifications.Materials and Methods', ' HNSCC (HN6, HN12 and HN13), HEK293 and NOK-SI cell lines were used. SET overexpression was obtained in HEK293 and NOK-SI cells using pcDNA3.1 with SET cDNA, and SET knockdown in HNSCC cells using siRNA or shRNA. Human transcription factors RT Profiler PCR Array profile (TF) and human tumor suppressor genes (TSG) EpiTect DNA Methyl qPCR Array System (SABioscience-Qiagen) were used to determine the SET action in gene transcription and DNA methylation. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), immunofluorescence, Western blotting and DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) activities (EpiSeeker DNMT Activity Quantification Kit; Abcam) assays were used. Trichostatin A (TSA, 100 ng/mL), which increases histone acetylation, or 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza, 1ug/mL), which decreases DNA methylation, were used for epigenetic modifications.Results', ' TFs mRNA analysis showed only 15 genes up-regulated and 65 down-regulated in HEK293/SET cells. Eight down-regulated (ATF2, CTNNB1, HIF-1A, NFATC3, RELA and STAT1) and two up-regulated (ATF3 and MYB) genes were also assessed by qPCR and similar mRNA profile was obtained. HNSCC SET knockdown cells presented opposite mRNA profile. ChIP analysis was performed for nine genes and HIF-1A, NFATC3 and STAT1 promoters showed interaction with SET. However, NFATC3 and STAT1 protein levels were not altered. DNA methylation profile of TSG showed that SET overexpression in HEK293 and NOK-SI cells promoted hypomethylation whereas SET knockdown in HN12 and HN13 cells promoted hypermethylation. HN6, HN12 and HN13 control cells, which present constitutive SET accumulation, presented a methylation loss pattern similar to the observed in HEK293 and NOK-SI cells with SET overexpression. GSTP1, PTEN and TP16 mRNAs levels decreased in SET-overexpressing cells despite the DNA demethylation status. To assess which modification is the main SET mechanism in the gene expression regulation, we performed qPCR in cell lines treated with TSA or 5-aza. TSA treatment reversed the SET overexpression effect in GSTP1, HIF-1A, NFATC3, PTEN, TP16 and STAT1 mRNA whereas 5-aza did not reverse.

Accumulated evidences suggest that intratumoral hypoxia, a characteristic of fast-growing solid tumors, promotes cancer cell motile and invasive abilities. In this study, we investigated the effects and interaction of hypoxia, surrounding fibroblasts, and p16 expression on the migration and invasion of breast cancer (BCa) cells MDA-MB-231, JygMC(A) and LM2. We found that hypoxia promoted BCa cell migration and invasion, and cocultured MEF fibroblasts stimulated invasiveness of BCa cells. Moreover, by using a Tet-on inducible system, we found that p16 is capable of inhibiting hypoxia-induced BCa cell migration and invasion (e.g., 36.0% and 85.8% inhibition on migration and invasion, respectively, in MDA-MB-231 cells), and suppressing cocultured fibroblast-stimulated invasiveness of BCa cells. These results suggest that p16, in addition to its well-known anti-tumor proliferation function, has novel anti-cancer properties capable of suppressing hypoxia-mediated cancer cell migration and invasion.

        "Background":"['Breast cancer is the leading cause of morbidity and second-leading cause of death in women worldwide. Breast stromal fibroblasts, the most abundant and the most reactive cells of the tumor stroma, actively promote tumor growth, invasion, migration, angiogenesis and metastasis through elevated secretion of several factors including SDF1, MMP-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). These secretions are under the control of several tumor suppressor genes such as p16, p53 and CAV-1, which were fond to be down-regulated in most active fibroblasts. Therefore, our major aim in this study was to study the potential use of caffeine to up-regulate these tumor suppressor genes and hence reduces the secretion of these cancer-promoting factors. We have shown that low doses of caffeine up-regulate the tumor suppressor proteins p16, p21, p53 and CAV-1 in breast stromal fibroblasts. Consequently, the expression and secretion of MMP-2 and VEGF-A was reduced following caffeine treatment. Moreover, caffeine reduced the expression of SDF-1, TGF- and -SMA, three important markers of active fibroblast, suggesting that caffeine has the ability of normalizing stromal fibroblasts. To further confirm this, we have shown that caffeine suppresses stromal fibroblast-related enhancement of invasion/migration of breast cancer cells. Importantly, this effect was mediated through caffeine-dependent inactivation of the two major invasion/migration protein kinases Akt and Erk, through up-regulating PTEN in breast stromal fibroblasts. Furthermore, caffeine suppressed the expression/secretion of VEGF-A in breast stromal fibroblasts and their paracrine enhancement of angiogenesis in vitro. This effect was mediated through inhibition of the VEGF-A activator HIF-1. Therefore, we have clearly shown here that caffeine, a natural and pharmacologically safe product, has the potential to normalize breast stromal fibroblasts and consequently suppresses their paracrine procarcinogenic effects.']",

The LDLR knockdown clones 1 and 2 had a reduction of tumor volume of 11% and 30% in the WT mice, 28% and 62% in LDLR-/- mice, and 26% and 53% in the ApoE-/- mice, respectively compared with the control shRNA cells. Western blot analysis of tumor protein lysates showed an increase in p19 cleaved caspase 3 in the tumors with LDLR knockdown, compared with the control cells. In vitro studies demonstrated a decrease in survival of MCNeuA cells with LDLR knockdown in serum starved conditions, and an increase in caspase 3 cleavage. These data demonstrate that hyperlipidemia promotes the growth of Her2/Neu overexpressing breast cancer cells and the LDLR plays an important role in protecting Her2 / Neu tumors from apoptosis. Therefore, targeting cholesterol uptake and metabolism may be an important strategy for women with HER2 positive breast cancers.']",

        "Background":"['Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most prevalent form of primary brain cancer in adults. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to drive the growth and metastasis of tumors, and are readily isolated from GBM patient tumors. These GBM CSCs are maintained under serum-free conditions in neurosphere media, and form tumors upon orthotopic injection in mice. However, when grown in the presence of serum, GBM CSCs undergo morphological changes, have reduced proliferation, exhibit loss of stem cell markers, and have reduced tumorigenicity following orthotopic implantation into the brains of immune compromised mice. Upon return to serum-free neurosphere media, these GBM CSCs revert to neurospheres. We set out to define the transcriptional incongruities between these culture condition-dependent states, and the underlying epigenetic changes which regulate these differences in gene expression. Although genetic alterations in cancer are irreversible, epigenetic changes are inherently reversible, and we hypothesize that the plasticity between culture condition-dependent states is mediated by epigenetic regulation of genes relevant to the ability of these cells to form tumors. Recently, a novel epigenetic mark, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), has been shown to be enriched at regulatory elements within polycomb target genes in embryonic stem cells, and is frequently found at genes that are involved in the maintenance of stem cells. We found that 5hmC levels of several polycomb target genes, including p16INK4A and several components of the TGF-beta pathway involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), are altered in neurospheres compared to CSCs cultured in serum. Loss of p16INK4A expression has recently been associated with increased CSC abundance in breast cancer, and our results suggest that a similar trend exists in GBM. Furthermore, our results suggest that 5hmC is involved in the regulation of polycomb target genes in CSCs, including p16INK4A and components of the TGF-beta pathway. These findings implicate 5hmC in the maintenance of CSCs and regulation of EMT.']",

The resulting tumors depend on high MYC levels for survival. A direct interaction of Aurka and MYC was identified in p53 altered liver cancer cells, which could be efficiently disrupted by conformation changing Aurka inhibitors, resulting in MYC degradation and cell death specifically of p53 altered human and murine hepatoma cells.

        "Background":"['Background', ' ATC is a rare thyroid cancer with a highly aggressive clinical course. Median OS is 3-4 months and 90% of patients die within 1 year of the diagnosis. There are no effective treatment options in metastatic disease. Targeted therapies to ALK and BRAF are occasionally associated with dramatic responses. Retinoblastoma (Rb) inhibits cell cycle progression and is inactivated by CDK 4/6, which is the target for ribociclib. Nearly all differentiated thyroid cancers are Rb negative, conversely nearly 100% of ATC expresses intact Rb which may be crucial for rapid cell cycle progression. Ribociclib is a CDK 4/6 inhibitors that slows cell cycle progression and DNA replication in tumors with functional Rb. The p16 protein similarly inhibits CDK4/6; if p16 levels are high Rb is phosphorylated and thus inactive. p16 is low in ATC, and from our comprehensive genomic analysis 30% of ATC lacks the p16 gene CDKN2a. Most ATC demonstrates PI3K/Akt/mTOR abnormalities, this pathway represents an attractive target in ATC. The mTOR inhibitor everolimus has shown promising efficacy in ATC cell lines, especially in those with TSC2 mutation whose wild type negatively regulates mTOR. Methods', \" The combination of everolimus and ribociclib targets mutations/abnormalities that are frequently seen in ATC, and is tolerable based on Phase I/II trial results in the latest arm of the biomarker/oncogene driven ATC Master Protocol . This open-label trial treats metastatic Rb+ ATC patients with p16-/CDKN2a-. Treatment is ribociclib 400 mg + everolimus 5 mg QD. The primary endpoint is the overall response rate; secondary endpoints are PFS, OS, safety and toxicity. Exploratory objectives include if tissue biomarkers or mutations noted on Next Generation Sequencing correlate for enhanced/impaired response to combination therapy.

        "Background":"['Background', ' It has been well documented that several cancers exhibit a large amount of heterogeneity when evaluating cells from different patients. However, few studies have quantified the level of cellular heterogeneity observed within an individual patient. This is significant because patients are often treated based upon expression of certain protein biomarkers, yet heterogeneous expression of these markers may affect the success of current targeted drug strategies. The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess intra-individual heterogeneity of standard clinical markers in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).Experimental Design', ' Thirty-eight breast cancer cases in which patients were concurrently diagnosed with DCIS and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) were used. Sequential sections from paraffin embedded tissue blocks were cut and immunostained with anti-ER, -PR, -HER-2, -Ki-67, -p16, -p53, and -p63 antibodies. Ten DCIS lesions from each patient were randomly selected and scored. Significant variation in IHC marker expression was defined by 20% of the lesions within an individual showing staining patterns that differed from the majority of lesions within that individual. Individuals were considered to display heterogeneity among DCIS lesions when at least 2/6 markers were classified as having significant variations in expression. In order to determine if the proportion of cases exhibiting variable expression for a single marker was higher than our hypothesized value of 10%, a one-sided exact binomial test was done at the 5% significance level.Results', ' Our results showed that PR, HER-2, Ki-67, and p16 displayed significant expression variations in DCIS lesions in individual patients in 21%, 58%, 47% and 61% of cases, respectively (P < 0.05 for PR; P < 1  108 for HER-2, Ki-67 and p16). In addition, seventy-one percent of individuals had heterogeneous expression in at least 2/6 markers (P < 1 x 1018). As previous studies indicated that DCIS displays four molecular subtypes, including luminal A, luminal B, HER2+, and basal-like, we further examined the heterogeneous status in regards to DCIS subtypes. As a result, 39.5% cases (15 out of 38) showed DCIS heterogeneity in molecular subtypes (P < 0.001). Interestingly, DCIS/IDC concurrent patients exhibiting more heterogeneity in DCIS seem more likely to have nodal involvement (P < 0.05).Conclusions', ' Our results quantitatively demonstrate for the first time that intra-individual heterogeneity in multi-lesional DCIS is common. Given that these results were from patients concurrently diagnosed with invasive and in situ ductal carcinoma, this could indicate that heterogeneity itself could be a predictor of subsequent development of IDC.This work was kindly supported by the FCCC Personalized Risk and Prevention Keystone, the Susan G.

Increased immunogenicity may relate to senescence or proliferation.  Senescence, a state of cell-cycle arrest, slows tumour progression. In animal models, senescence associated regression is mediated by upregulated antitumour immune responses.  High proliferation may provoke immune responses.  Relationships between senescence, proliferation and immune cell infiltrates have not previously been studied.  We explore whether p16ink4a associated senescence relates to T cell infiltrates in colorectal tumours and whether p16ink4a expression, proliferation and T cell infiltrates confer similar survival relationships.   Methods', '   Immunostaining of nuclear p16inka and Ki67 was performed using a tissue microarray.  Nuclear p16inkaand Ki67 were scored as high or low expression.  (T cell markers CD3/CD45RO/CD8/FOXP3) were scored high/low grade on corresponding full sections (margin/stroma/ cancer cell nest).   Results', '  230 Stage I-III cancers were studied. High nuclear p16ink4a was expressed in 63% and high proliferation (Ki67 >15% ) in 61%.  P16ink4a expression related to reduced margin, stroma and cancer cell nest (CCN) CD45RO cells (P=0.054, P=0.062, P=0.025) and reduced margin CD8 cells (P=0.016).  High Ki67 labeling related to increased margin, and CCN CD3 cells (P=0.017, P<0.001), increased margin and CCN CD45RO cells (P=0.023, P<0.001), increased margin, stroma and CCN FOXP3 cells (P<0.001, P=0.001, P<0.001) and increased margin and CCN CD8 cells (P=0.026, P=0.001).

Conclusions', '   p16ink4a expression, proliferation and immune cell infiltrates are independent prognostic factors in colorectal cancer.

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' HPV positive SCCHN has a distinct set of molecular alterations and a better prognosis in the locally advanced setting. When HPV is integrated into the host cell genome, HPV protein E7 degrades host retinoblastoma protein, an inhibitor of p16INK4A transcription. Thus, in persistent HPV gene expressing tumors, elevated p16INK4A RNA and protein levels serve as a surrogate of HPV infection applicable to FFPE archival tumor specimens. Our aim was to qualify an existing IHC assay for reliable detection of active HPV expression in SCCHN archival FFPE tumor samples from a randomized phase 3 trial in the recurrent/metastatic (R/M) treatment setting. Methods', ' The CINtec p16INK4A Histology Kit is a semi quantitative, immunocytochemical assay for the evaluation of p16INK4A protein expression in FFPE sections. Banked SCCHN specimens were examined for p16INK4A expression to establish repeatability, reproducibility, and long term analyte stability (blocks and slides). Comparative studies were performed with a p16INK4A reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR) assay and an HPV in situ hybridization assay to examine intra assay concordance. Results', ' 101 banked SCCHN FFPE tumor specimens were utilized for the qualification study. 42 of 101 (42%) SCCHN specimens (all sites) and 17 of 41 (41%) oropharyngeal specimens were HPV positive by p16INK4A. Five slides from each of 6 SCCHN specimens ranging in the percentage of cells expressing p16INK4A (positive, low positive, and negative) were tested on a single day to demonstrate inter assay repeatability. Serial sections from 6 tumors were tested on 3 consecutive working days using multiple automated staining instruments run by different technicians to determine intra assay reproducibility. Inter pathologist scoring, blinded to run, was demonstrably consistent. Positive p16INK4A staining was demonstrated in blocks stored up to 19 years. Analyte stability was demonstrated in cut sections prepared 27 months in advance. Comparative assay studies yielded consistent, though not identical, results. These results led to the design and implementation of a detailed imaging scoring guideline. Conclusions', ' The CINtecTM p16INK4A Histology Kit was qualified for use as a surrogate for HPV infection in SCCHN specimens. This assay was then utilized to test banked specimens from a randomized, phase 3 study of the anti EGFR antibody panitumumab in patients with HPV positive R/M SCCHN tumors. In this study, patients with HPV positive tumors did not benefit from the addition panitumumab to a platinum + 5 fluorouracil chemotherapy regimen whereas there was a significant improvement in overall survival in the HPV negative group (Vermorken et al., European Multidisciplinary Cancer Congress 2011).']",
