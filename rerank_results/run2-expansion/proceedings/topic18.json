        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Melanoma is one of the most aggressive malignant tumors, and at the metastatic stage is an incurable disease. PD-L1 is a transmembrane molecule that can be expressed by melanoma cells and that has been speculated to play role in inducing immunosuppression by interacting with the PD-1 receptor on T cells. The clinical and biological significance of PD-L1 expression in metastatic melanoma remains partially elusive.Methods', ' PD-L1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry using two different antibodies [anti-human B7-H1 monoclonal antibody (clone 5H1) and a rabbit polyclonal AB58810 antibody (Abcam)]. In primary tumors and paired metastases from 83 consecutive melanoma patients treated at a single institution. Protein expression levels were correlated with PD-L1 mRNA, BRAF mutational status and clinical outcome. PD-L1+ and PD-L1- subsets of the A375 cell line were stabilized in vitro and compared using gene expression profiling and functional assays. Results were confirmed in vivo using xenograft models.Results', ' PD-L1 membrane positivity was detected in 24/83 (19%) of patients. By multivariate analysis, PD-L1 membrane expression (95% CI 1.48-4.67, P< 0.001), age >57 years [CI 95% 1.20-3.71, P< 0.009] and stage M1c (95% CI 1.01-3.38, P< 0.045) were independent predictors of poor prognosis. PD-L1 expression defined a subset of the A375 cell line characterized by a specific genetic profile. PD-L1+ A375 cells also showed a highly invasive phenotype and enhanced ability to grow in vivo using immunocompromised mouse models.Conclusions', ' PD-L1 may be proposed as a novel prognostic marker in metastatic melanoma. Furthermore, it defines a distinct morpho-phenotypic subset of the disease with a specific genetic signature and a different biological behavior. Future studies will tell whether PD-L1 targeting using blocking monoclonal antibodies alone or in combination with other treatments will provide clinical benefit.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

        "Background":"['Tumor associated macrophages and regulatory T cells (Tregs) have an important role in tumor progression as a part of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. By means of immunosuppression, melanoma, as well as many other cancers, is able to resist anti-cancer immune reactions. To understand the mechanisms how tumor cells escape from the anti-tumor immune response is the key for efficient treatment strategies. In several cancers, programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) -mediated pathways have been shown to suppress anti-tumor immune responses. Our aim was to investigate the number of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and Tregs in benign, premalign and malign melanocytic lesions to find out if the density of these cells is associated with the tumor stage or survival in melanoma. Moreover, the expression of PD-L1 was studied. Altogether 187 tissue samples, including 29 benign and 27 dysplastic nevi, 16 in situ melanomas, 38 superficial (Breslow < 1 mm) and 43 deep (Breslow > 4 mm) melanomas and 34 lymph node metastases, were stained immunohistochemically for CD68 and CD163 representing all TAMs and M2-like macrophages, respectively and for FoxP3, a marker for Tregs. In addition, a part of the FFPE -samples was dual stained for CD68 and PD-L1. Macrophages and Tregs were counted using a hot spot -method. In the statistical analyses, the cell numbers were graded as either low or high according to the median. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the macrophage numbers in different groups and Pearson chi-square test to study the correlations between the numbers of CD163 and CD68 -positive cells and clinicopathological parameters. CD68+ and CD163+ macrophage numbers were significantly higher in malign melanocytic lesions and lymph node metastasis compared to in situ melanomas and benign nevi. In deep melanomas and lymph node metastases macrophages located mainly inside the tumor nests whereas in thin melanomas they were mostly scattered around the tumor. High CD68+ macrophage number correlated with the presence of ulceration (p=0.011) and with both local recurrence (p=0.008) and recurrence with distal metastases (p=0.002). PD-L1 immunoreactivity was relatively scanty in melanoma samples being restricted to certain areas only; both membraneous and cytoplasmic staining was observed. Overall, the staining was higher in deep melanomas and lymph node metastases compared to superficial melanomas. Dual stainings indicated that in addition to tumor cells, a part of the tumor infiltrating CD68+ macrophages were PD-L1 -positive. The density of FoxP3+ cells did not correlate with the tumor stage. However, the number of these cells was significantly lower in benign nevi compared to other groups. Our observations highlight that TAMs are involved in melanoma progression and have an important role in the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.']",

Methods', '  Tumor PD-L1 membrane expression was assessed in archival FFPE specimens by immunohistochemistry (28-8 PD-L1 antibody). ALC was measured in serial PB samples; changes in the percentage, number and phenotype of activated CD4+ and CD8+T cells and MDSC were characterized by flow cytometry.   Results', '  PD-L1 expression was seen in 37% (10/27) of pts, using a cut-off of 5% tumor cell membrane staining.

Relative to baseline, a rise in ALC was not detected, but phenotypic changes in PB T-cell subsets, including increases in the percentage of CD4 and CD8 expressing HLA-DR, ICOS and/or Ki67 were seen with combination therapy. Low ALC (<1.0 at wk 6-7) did not preclude OR as 3 of 12 pts with low ALC responded. Of pts evaluated, OR with 80% reduction in tumor burden at 12 wk were seen in pts with a low frequency of pretreatment PB MDSC (3/7) but no OR were seen in pts with high MDSC (0/6).   Conclusions', '  In this small subset of pts,OR were seen independent of PD-L1 or ALC status in contrast to prior observations with nivolumab or ipilimumab, respectively. Thus, the immune response generated by combination therapy may have unique features compared to either monotherapy. The relationship between frequency of PB MDSC and reduction in tumor burden will be further explored.

Anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy has shown promising results in certain malignancies, such as melanoma and lung cancer. Therefore, we performed PD-L1 immunohistochemical staining on 30 specimens of ovarian carcinosarcoma collected from patients that underwent surgeries at our institution between 2002 and 2015. In addition, we performed RNAscope in-situ hybridization to examine PD-L1 mRNA expression in 16 specimens that were collected within past 5 years (2010-2015). Our result demonstrated focally membranous expression of PD-L1 protein in 23 of 30 cases (77%). PD-L1 mRNA expression correlated with membranous, but not cytoplasmic expression of PD-L1 protein.

In addition, tumor-associated PD-L1 has been proposed as a predictor of response to anti-PD-1 therapy, although responses are observed in some cases of PD-L1 negative MM. We hypothesize that tumor-derived PD-L1 has additional systemic effects through the release of biologically active soluble forms of PD-L1 (sPD-L1) into the circulation, which further impedes the anti-tumor immune response and contributes to poor clinical outcomes in MM. Methods', ' We developed a sPD-L1 ELISA and biochemically confirmed the identity of the detected protein. We measured the levels of sPD-L1 in 276 patients with MM enrolled on 3 clinical trials who had stored pre-treatment plasma samples and 37 healthy volunteers (HV) undergoing blood donation at Mayo Clinic. We also measured sPD-L1 in baseline samples from 38 MM patients treated with anti-PD1 (pembrolizumab) 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. ROC analysis was used to compute sPD-L1 concentration cut-off value and Wald test was used to asses the difference of overall survival (OS) in patients with low versus high sPD-L1 concentration. Results', ' We found that sPD-L1 levels were significantly elevated in MM patients compared with HV (p=0.0011). Mean sPD-L1 level in MM was 1.73 ng/mL (range', ' 0.13-18.29) compared with 0.77 ng/mL (range', ' 0.116.02) for HV.

        "Background":"['Over 1 million cases of skin cancer are diagnosed in the US every year, of which 75% deaths result due to melanoma, one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer, arising from melanocytes. We have isolated five patient derived melanoma cell lines (MEL-V, 3MM, GLM2, Mel2, KFM) and characterized the expression of various melanoma associated antigens (MAAs). The presence of a multitude repertoire of common MAAs (Gp100, MART-1, MAGE-A1, NY-ESO-1, Tyrosinase, TRP-1 (Gp75), TRP-2, Melanotransferrin, CD71, CD146) enabled us to use composite cell membrane preparations of these cells as a multivalent vaccine. To this end, we designed a vaccinia virus vaccine that was composed of membrane lysate preparations of the five primary cells and recombinant IL-2. When tested in a pilot study, delayed type hypersensitivity and a multivalent immune response were noted. In an effort to correlate genetic lesions with MAA expression we observed that in BRAF mutant melanoma cells, treatment with a BRAFv600E inhibitor, PLX4032, enhanced the expression of MAAs making the melanoma cells more visible to the vaccination driven immune response. We also observed that melanoma cells constitutively expressed CTLA-4 as determined by Immunofluorescence and Western Blots. This expression was found on the membranes as well as in the cytoplasm in comparatively high levels on wild type as well as the BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cell lines. Further our results suggest that CTLA-4 expression on melanoma cells promotes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment enabling tumor evasion. Given that CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies such as Ipilimumab are approved for clinical treatment, this study opens up a new avenue into a plausible combinatorial therapy for our vaccinia virus based vaccine with Ipilimumab for BRAF mutant as well as wild type melanoma cells.']",

Methods', '    Endogenous tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells were identified by their high expression of PD-1 and CD11a CD8+ T cells and their expression of Bim,  a pro-apoptotic molecule, in the peripheral blood of 26 patients with metastatic melanoma and 11 patients with metastatic prostate cancer or healthy donors using flow cytometry.  Soluble PD-L1 in patients sera was quantified using ELISA.   Results', '    The target-cell engaged CD8+ T cell population was significantly higher in patients with melanoma and prostate cancer compared to healthy donors, as assessed by CD11a and PD-1  expression.   Bim expression was higher in  CD8+ T cells in both cancer patients than healthy controls (p<0.01). In patients with advanced melanoma, Bim was significantly higher in the PD-1(+) target cell-engaged CD8+ T cells than the PD-1(-) CD-8+ T cells (P<0.01).   Bim levels above the base line levels of healthy donors in the CD8+ T cells correlated with decreased survival in patients with melanoma (8.9 months v. 13.8  months, p<0.05).  Our data suggest that the Bim level is dependent on PD-1 expression, and that higher Bim expression may be indicative of PD-1(+) CD8+ T cells which have engaged B7-H1 (PD-L1), either soluble (peripheral blood) or membrane bound (tumor cells), and are susceptible to apoptotic death.  Conclusions', '    PD-1+ CD11a high CD8+ T cells identify a unique population of effector cells responsive to target tumor cells in cancer patients. Elevated Bim expression in CD8+ T cells may indicate the active immune inhibiting effects of PD-1/B7-H1 signaling on endogenous antitumor T cell responses. Bim expression can serve as a signaling biomarker for PD-1 function and may be useful in selecting patients who may benefit from checkpoint blockade therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Background', '    Despite substantial progress, only a select subset of patients benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. The underlying cause for these failures of immune checkpoint blockade therapy is the overwhelming, persistent and multifocal immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment. As phosphatidylserine (PS) becomes externalized to the outer leaflet of the cells plasma membrane within the tumor microenvironment, it serves as a signaling ligand for PS receptors on immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells and M2 macrophages that can occupy up to 50% of the tumor mass. Bavituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets and inhibits PS mediated immunosuppressive signaling, supporting immune activation and reducing levels of MDSCs, re-polarizing tumor-associated macrophages from M2 to M1 phenotype, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and inducing potent antitumor T-cell immunity. Methods', '    A combination of bavituximab and anti-PD-1 therapy was compared in syngeneic, pre-clinical models of melanoma and breast cancer. Results', '    Our results show that the combination induces a statistically significant activation of lymphocytes in the spleen and the tumor microenvironment as well as decreases MDSCs and PD-L1 expression. In the spleen, increases were noted in T-cells producing IFN-g and IL-2 and DCs in association with decreased MDSCs over single anti-PD-1 treatment alone. Similarly, in the tumor microenvironment, the combination treatment demonstrates increases in TILs producing IFN-g, TNF, IL-2, Granzyme B, PD-1, increased Lag-3 positive CD8 cells, CD137 (41BB) positive CD4 cells as well as a decrease in MDSCs and PD-L1 expressing TILs compared to anti-PD-1 treatment alone. Conclusions', '    Our pre-clinical results support the use of bavituximab as an immunomodulatory treatment in PD-1 sensitive and anti-PD-1 resistant/unresponsive tumors.

Prevention of both primary and secondary melanomas requires the development of a melanoma specific multi-valent vaccine. We have been involved in developing a vaccinia virus based vaccine consisting of melanoma cell membrane antigens and integrated vaccinia viral proteins, which serve as a potent adjuvant. This melanoma vaccine, referred to as viral membrane oncolysate (VMO), is composed of five primary cell lines derived from patient tumors each independently infected with vaccinia virus and has been shown to induce anti-cancer immune response in clinical trials. Notable results were obtained in node positive subsets of patients that showed a positive response in survival distribution function suggesting that this preparation is an active therapeutic immunogen but the mechanism of immune activation needs to be elucidated. In order for us to define the immunogens that impart the clinical efficacy of the this melanoma VMO vaccine, it is essential to characterize the primary cell lines with respect to their phenotypic characteristics as well as to define the melanoma antigen repertoire so that effective vaccine strategies can be designed that do not rely exclusively on tumor derived primary cells. Our study reveals that all the five primary cell lines expressed antigens, such as gp100, CD146, and tyrosinase, similar to several commercially available melanoma cell lines although at varying concentrations. In addition, the five primary cell lines demonstrated varying migratory/invasive properties using a Boyden Chamber assay and their tumorigenic potential is being tested in nude mice. The cells were also characterized with respect to BRAF mutations. We observed several similarities between the antigenic profile of the primary and established cell lines as well as some unique characteristics. We conclude that using a combination of defined antigens from primary tumor cells is useful in designing a pan-antigen immunotherapeutic vaccine. This melanoma pan antigen vaccine can be an effective tool in primary prevention of melanoma presumably having the highest clinical efficacy when combined with unique antigens from primary cells.']",

Results', ' 37.8% of the cases showed a membranous PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and 74.9% in tumor infiltrating immune cells.

We also observed the close relationship between CD3+, CD8+ cell density and PDL1 expression both in tumor cells and in infiltrating immune cells. Conclusions', ' This study indicates that PDL1 expression, and TILs in particular, are important prognostic biomarkers. Patients with higher CD8 and CD3 T cell densities also have higher PD-L1 expression, indicating an adaptive immune resistance mechanism may be occurring. The counterintuitive observation that higher PD-L1 expression associating with better patients outcome highlights the need to assess both PDL1 expression in all tumor compartments and the characterization of the GC immune microenvironment.']",

PD-1 blockade mediated by monoclonal antibodies has yielded promising therapeutic effects in treatment of melanoma, lung cancer and kidney cancers. Although detecting PD-1 expression by T cells is relatively straightforward, a simple and reliable method for determining whether PD-1 on T cells has engaged its ligand B7-H1 (PD-L1) is wanting. Our previous studies have revealed that engagement of PD-1 or B7-1 by B7-H1 results in alternations of apoptosis signaling pathway by up-regulating pro-apoptotic molecules among activated T cells and are correlated with B7-H1-mediated T cell death. Those observations suggest that intracellular levels of apoptosis-related Bcl2 family molecules among PD-1 positive CD8 T cells may be barometers of the extent to which PD-1 has been triggered by B7-H1. Using PD-1 and B7-H1 deficient animal models, we found that lower levels of intracellular pro-apoptosis molecules identify those activated T cells whose PD-1 molecules have not yet been extensively engaged, thus T cell function might be restored to their normal function once PD-1 signals from B7-H1 are blocked. Similarly, human PD-1 positive CD8 T cells engaged by B7-H1 also expressed higher levels of pro-apoptosis molecules during antigen stimulation. Our clinical data demonstrated that pro-apoptosis molecule expression by tumor-reactive T cell levels are higher among advanced melanoma and prostate cancers than healthy controls, reflecting chronic engagement with B7-H1. Thus, using pro-apoptosis status as signaling biomarkers for T cell PD-1 engagement, it may be possible to select patients who are most likely to have strong benefit from PD-1 or B7-H1 (PD-L1) blockade therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Glioblastoma can avoid immune surveillance and induce tumor tolerance, through inhibitory molecules, e.g. PD-L1. Ionizing radiation (IR), used to treat this tumor, is known to increase tumor expression of PD-L1, thus inducing resistance mechanisms. Finding molecular determinants involved in IR-induced PD-L1 may provide a target for preventing such an effect and improve radiotherapy outcomes. We demonstrated that the short isoform of the cochaperone FKBP51 (FKBP51s) regulated PD-L1 expression in melanoma. In glioma, FKBP51s was expressed at high levels, together with PD-L1 and its silencing reduced PD-L1 levels. Conversely, overexpression of FKBP51s increased PD-L1. Different PD-L1 isoforms were observed by immunoblot. A lower band (~37 kDa) corresponding to the naïve protein and two upper bands (~50, ~68 kDa) ascribable to post-translationally modified isoforms. FKBP51s was found mainly bound to the heaviest bands of PD-L1, reasonably mature protein, while the canonical isoform FKBP51 appeared to bind only the naïve protein. Mature PD-L1 protein consists in carbohydrates addition, the principal chemical modification to most plasma membrane proteins, and, particularly, N-glycosylation. Treatment of immunoprecipitated PD-L1 protein with PNGaseF produced a decrease of the highest band and the appearance of a lower band, corresponding to the naïve PD-L1, in accordance with the concept that the heaviest band of PD-L1 is a glycosylated form. Moreover, following subcellular fractionation to obtain extracts from ER and Golgi compartments, we found that naïve 37 kDa PD-L1 was detectable in the ER, but not in the Golgi. The PD-L1 glycosylated band was expressed in ER in a small proportion and mostly in the Golgi. FKBP51s, but not the canonical FKBP51, was found in ER. Co-IP of FKBP51s and PD-L1 from ER extract confirmed the two proteins interacted each other in ER. Our results show that naïve PD-L1 colocalized in the ER of glioma cell complexed with FKBP51s, while the PD-L1 glycosylated form was measured in the Golgi apparatus. Treatment of glioma cell with increasing doses of IR upregulated PD-L1 expression, in a dose-response manner. Particularly, we found a significant increase in PD-L1 expression at 4 and 8 Gy, in comparison with unirradiated glioma cell. Moreover, IR induction of mature PD-L1 was efficiently counteracted by FKBP51s silencing. Subcellular fractionation of glioma cell subjected to IR in kinetics showed an early and transitory decrease in FKBP51s ER levels at 3hrs, in line with a reduction of the glycosylated band in the whole lysate. After 8 hrs from IR, FKBP51s rose up again in the ER inducing a full maturation of PD-L1. These findings suggested that FKBP51s has a role in catalyzing PD-L1 folding, an essential step to glycosylation, through which it controls the affinity for PD1. This study identifies FKBP51s as an essential element that regulates PD-L1 expression on glioma cell, which is exploited by the tumor to resist to IR.']",

CTLA-4 inhibitory function in T cells mainly occurs upon engagement with the B7 ligands expressed on antigen presenting cells, resulting in inhibition of cytokine production and T cell proliferation. CTLA-4 expression has also been documented in established human melanoma cell lines and primary melanoma tumours. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and functional role of CTLA-4 in primary melanoma cultures derived from biopsies of metastatic melanoma patients. Methods', ' Seven primary cultures were derived from melanoma samples by mechanical tissue dissociation, enzymatic digestion and filtration of single cell suspensions. Flow cytometry (FACS) with an anti-melanoma (MCSP) mAb was used to assess the growth of melanoma cells. CTLA-4 expression analysis was performed by FACS and real-time PCR. Cytokine secretion and apoptotic cells were evaluated by Elisa and Annexin V/PI staining after treatment with an agonistic anti-CTLA-4 mAb (3D5). The angiogenic property of melanoma culture supernatants was evaluated on mesenchimal stromal cells (msc) isolated from human thoracic aortas. All the study was approved by our Institutional Ethics Committee and patients gave written informed consent. Results', ' Constitutive CTLA-4 expression was found on all melanoma cultures with variable intensity at both the protein and transcript levels. CTLA-4 expressed by these cells is functional as its ligation, with an anti-CTLA-4 agonistic mAb, is able to induce inhibition of cell proliferation, due to apoptosis induction, and of IL-8, TNF-alpha and VEGF cytokine secretion. Moreover, CTLA-4 ligation down-modulates the ability of melanoma culture supernatants to induce angiogenic differentiation of msc as detected by the acquisition of their endothelial phenotype.

Previously, we studied the chemopreventive effects of SD on non-melanoma tumor development using both animal and cellular models. In this current study, we used the mouse melanoma B16F10 cell line to investigate the possible effects of SD on melanoma cell development. We found that SD at a 250 M concentrations inhibits cell duplication. Melanoma cells treated with SD do not form the contractile ring, a multi-protein complex involved in cell division. As a result of cytoskeleton modification, cells treated with SD do not show the ability to carry out de novo synthesis of DNA, and their DNA show a high degree of fragmentation compared to untreated controls. To explore the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the disassembly of the contractile machinery, our studies show that SD treatment inhibits cell membrane permeability for small molecular mass compounds (e.g. ethidium bromide which is used as an indicator for cell permeability to Ca2+ ions). These findings are consistent with the observation that SD increases cleavage of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), resulting in low PLA2 enzymatic activity. These findings are also consistent with the observation that SD, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, inhibits the expression level of the cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2). As a result of the decline in membrane permeability in SD treated cells and the negative effect of SD on the protein level of phospholipase C (PLC), which both affect the activity of contractile machinery, the non-dividing cells undergo apoptosis. The latter notion is supported by findings that SD inhibits the expression of STAT-3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription protein), and cyclin D1 (an activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 4, Cdk4). SD treatment also enhances the cellular level of the tumor suppressing protein 53 (p53) and stimulates cleavage of the nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (cleaved-PARP). SD also enhances the cellular level of cleaved-Caspase-3, -8, -9 and stimulates enzymatic activities of Caspase-3, -8 and -9. All these findings, in addition to inhibition of cell viability, suggest that SD most likely inhibits melanoma cell growth by arresting the cell-division cycle in a Go quiescent phase and simultaneously activates apoptosis via extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.']",

More than 60% of human melanoma expresses GRM1, while normal melanocytes do not. In a Phase-0 trial of riluzole (an oral inhibitor of GRM1) in patients with advanced melanoma we showed suppression of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways in melanoma specimens in 34% of the patients.Our group found that enhanced expression of GRM1 in a subclone of a melanoma cell line (UACC903) that normally expresses low levels of GRM1 stimulated angiogenesis via activation of the AKT-mTOR-HIF1-IL8, VEGF signaling pathway. Increasing GRM1 expression promoted membrane blebbing (a phenomenon that appears to lead to microvesicle formation) and riluzole treatment inhibited this effect. Suppression of GRM1 expression using an inducible siRNA construct inhibits the blebbing phenomena and microvesicle formation. Therefore, we hypothesize that GRM1 expression promotes microvesicle formation that may be involved in stimulating angiogenesis and tumor progression. Through electron-microscope and flow cytometry analysis, we have confirmed that increased GRM1 expression enhanced microvesicle secretion into the medium in cell culture and that knocking down GRM1 expression significantly reduced the quantity of microvesicle secretion. Furthermore, intra-tumor injection of collected microvesicles into two different melanoma xenograft tumors (UACC903 and C8161) demonstrated that the microvesicles formed from high GRM1 expressing cells promoted tumor growth and angiogenesis.

        "Background":"['Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, has long been a major focus of immunotherapy. Adoptive T cell therapy-based cancer immunotherapy has been used to enhance the specificity and potential of host immune system to treat melanoma. However, the infiltration and antitumor function of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) are blocked or down-regulated by various signals derived from tumor cells and cells in tumor microenvironment. A novel approach to specify and enhance the homing ability of CTLs to tumor is of high demand. Interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) is over-expressed on many types of cancer cells, including melanoma, and has been widely employed for targeted drug delivery. In this work, we examined whether the tumor homing efficiency and anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy of CTLs could be heighten by labeling CTLs with IL4RPep-1, a targeting peptide that binds to IL-4R. The labeling was empowered by conjugating IL4RPep-1 with Dioleylphosphatidylethanolamine-biological anchor for membrane (DOPE-BAM), an oleyl acid-derived membrane anchor that incorporates into lipid membrane of cells. Tumor-specific CTLs isolated from the mice immunized by irradiated B16F10 melanoma cells were highly populated with CD62L+CD44+ activated T cells. After labeling with IL4RPep-1 via DOPE-BAM, CTLs were still functionally active, as determined by intracellular interferon-γ and granzyme release assays. Moreover, such labeling did not affect the proliferation of T cells. Adoptive transfer of IL4RPep-1-labeled, IL-4R-targeted CD45.1+CTLs into CD45.2 mice bearing B16F10 melanoma enhanced their accumulation at tumor compared to that of unlabeled T cells. Tumor homing of IL4RPep-1-labeled T cells was further validated by in vivo fluorescence imaging of mice bearing 4T1 tumor at mammary gland. Adoptive transfer of IL-4R-targeted CTLs showed remarkable anti-tumor growth activity in mice bearing B16F10 tumor compared to untargeted CTLs. After the transfer, flow cytometric study of immune cells showed significant increase of CD8+ T cells and F4/80+CD86+M1-polarized macrophages with noticeable decrease in tumor-promoting immune cells, such as F4/80+CD206+M2-polarized macrophages, Gr1+CD11b+ myeloid derived suppressor cells, and CD3+CD4+ T cells. The CTLs accumulated at tumor were mostly exogenous CD45.1+ T cells.

It was postulated that exosomes may facilitate communication within the local microenvironment and the primary tumor, supporting melanoma cell dissemination and early events in metastasis. A gain-of-function mutation of a neuronal receptor, metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1), when ectopically expressed in melanocytes, was sufficient to induce in vitro melanocytic transformation and spontaneous malignant melanoma development in vivo in a transgenic mouse model. Normal mouse melanocytes transformed with an expression vector containing GRM1 showed production and secretion of exosomes confirmed by electron microscopy, while the parental normal melanocytes showed no detectable presence of exosomes. In light of this data, It was hypothesized that over-expression of GRM1 in melanoma cells normally expressing a moderate amount of the protein, may promote elevated levels of exosome formation, while inhibitors to the receptor or limiting the levels of available ligand may suppress exosome production. Preliminary results demonstrated the working hypothesis is correct. Our earlier studies showed that inhibitors of the receptor modulated GRM1-mediated signaling events interfere with downstream effectors resulting in a decrease in both cell proliferation in vitro and tumor progression in vivo. It is not known if GRM1 acts directly, via its signaling cascade, or by another route, on exosome production regulation, this will be investigated.

While recent clinical trials have shown significant patient response to chemotherapeutics targeting BRAFV600E, e.g. dabrafenib, tumors eventually become resistant and disease recurs. Development of additional novel therapies is therefore critical to better manage melanoma patients. Analysis of patient-derived melanoma lesions has revealed robust expression of the cell adhesion protein chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4). While not prognostic due to its expression in premalignant nevi, CSPG4 has been revealed to promote melanoma progression by enhancing cell growth, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Previous studies have shown CSPG4 to enhance activation of ERK1/2, PI3K and FAK, suggesting that CSPG4 likely contributes to oncogenic growth and survival through activation of a number of parallel signaling cascades. CSPG4 therefore represents a potential avenue for melanoma cell survival in response to chemotherapy. In support of this hypothesis, melanoma cells expressing endogenous or exogenous CSPG4 are more resistant to cell death induced by dabrafenib than cells lacking endogenous expression of CSPG4. Likewise, suppression of CSPG4 via siRNA reduced melanoma cell survival in response to dabrafenib. Melanoma cells expressing CSPG4 show enhanced growth in soft agar versus cells lacking CSPG4 expression, even in the presence of BRAFV600E inhibition. To determine the mechanism of CSPG4-driven resistance to BRAFV600E inhibition, activation of a number of oncogenic growth and survival pathways was interrogated. While ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the presence of BRAFV600E inhibition is unaffected by CSPG4, AKT phosphorylation is enhanced by expression of CSPG4. Moreover, this CSPG4-driven AKT activation in response to dabrafenib is dependent on PI3K, as treatment of melanoma cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 eliminated increased AKT phosphorylation by CSPG4 in response to dabrafenib. CSPG4 enhances Src-FAK complex assembly, membrane lipid subdomain localization, and activation in melanoma cells through syntenin-1-dependent scaffolding. A mutant of CSPG4 engineered to eliminate lipid microdomain localization of CSPG4, termed CSPG4C2230A, was unable to recapitulate this phenotype.CSPG4C2230A also failed to protect melanoma cells from cytotoxicity or promote growth in soft agar in the presence of BRAFV600E inhibition. Altogether, these data indicate that CSPG4 confers protection against cytotoxicity induced by BRAFV600E inhibition by organizing progression-associated signalosomes involved in AKT activation, making CSPG4 an attractive target for the development of adjuvant therapies. Ongoing studies focus on determining the mechanism of CSPG4-mediated AKT activation and on developing CSPG4-targeting melanoma treatments for use in preclinical models.']",

Remodeling of Ca2+ homeostasis during malignancy is caused by the rearrangement of the Ca2+ signaling machinery, including Ca2+ pumps, Na+/Ca2+ exchangers and channels. Plasma membrane calcium ATPases (ATP2B - or PMCA) maintain the resting low intracellular calcium concentration by pumping out excess calcium from the cytosol. Changes in PMCA expression during malignant transformation have been described previously in colorectal and breast cancer cells, and most recently by our group in melanomas. We found that in BRAF mutant melanoma cells the PMCA 4b protein level was markedly elevated by BRAF inhibitor treatment. Overexpression of PMCA4b suppressed motility and metastatic potential. Previously, it was shown that HDAC inhibitors-induced differentiation up-regulated PMCA4b expression in gastric, colon and breast cancer cells. In the present study we treated BRAF mutant and BRAF wild type melanoma cells with HDAC inhibitors (SAHA (suberanilohydroxamic acid) or valproic acid) and tested the changes in abundance, localization and function of PMCA4b. Expression levels of the PMCA proteins were analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western Blotting. Subcellular localization of the PMCAs and the effects of treatments on cytosolic Ca2+ signaling were analyzed by confocal microscopy. We found that treatment with the HDAC inhibitors increased the level of PMCA4b expression at both mRNA and protein levels in both BRAF wild type and BRAF mutant cell types. The increased PMCA4b level was coupled with enhanced plasma membrane localization and with a faster Ca2+ clearance after stimulation.

For that reason, understanding the molecular determinants controlling tumor angiogenesis is mandatory to develop clinically efficacious angiogenesis inhibitors for cancer therapy. Melanoma differentiation associated gene or mda-9, also known as syntenin, is a multifunctional scaffold protein that cross talks with a plethora of proteins and regulates diverse physiological and pathological processes, including tumor progression and metastasis. Since, tumor angiogenesis promotes metastasis, we hypothesized that in addition to augmenting invasion and migration, MDA-9/Syntenin might also promote angiogenesis thereby facilitating tumor progression and metastasis.Genetic (gain-of-function and loss-of-function) and pharmacological approaches were employed to modify mda-9/syntenin expression in normal immortal melanocytes, early radial growth phase melanoma and metastatic melanoma cells. The consequence of modifying mda-9/syntenin expression on angiogenesis was evaluated using both in vitro and in vivo assays, including tube formation assays using human vascular endothelial cells, chicken choriallantoic membrane assays (CAM assays) and xenograft tumor animal models.Employing both genetic and chemical approaches we now demonstrate that MDA-9/Syntenin expression correlates with in vitro and in vivo (tumorigenic/metastatic) transformed/invasive phenotypes of human melanoma. Additionally, our immunohistochemical and in vivo CAM assays confirm that angiogenesis is an essential component of MDA-9/Syntenin-induced tumor progression. To define how MDA-9/Syntenin regulates angiogenesis we identified and analyzed several potential downstream gene targets of MDA-9/Syntenin. One gene implicated in induction of vasculogenesis is insulin growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2), which is transcriptionally regulated by hypoxia inducible factor-1 as a consequence of MDA-9/Syntenin and Src interaction. IGFBP-2 transcriptionally regulates VEGF-A in an AKT-dependent manner through interaction with V3 integrin resulting in angiogenesis.Our studies delineate an unanticipated cell non-autonomous function of MDA-9/Syntenin in the context of angiogenesis by augmenting expression of several pro-angiogenic factors including IGFBP-2, which may provide a complementary way to promote metastasis. As a result, targeting MDA-9/syntenin or its downstream-regulated molecules may provide a means of simultaneously impeding metastasis by both directly inhibiting tumor cell transformed properties (autonomous) and indirectly by blocking angiogenesis (non-autonomous).']",

        "Background":"['Using transcriptomic analysis, we found that Phosphatase of Regenerating Liver-3 (PRL-3) overexpression is highly correlated with metastatic tumors and predicts poor prognosis in patients with uveal melanoma. PRL-3 is a dual specific phosphatase with a carboxy-terminal farnesylation motif, allowing anchorage to the plasma membrane. PRL-3 overexpression in ocular melanoma cell line-1 (OCM1) significantly increases cell migration in vitro and invasiveness in vivo, suggesting a direct role of PRL-3 in metastasis (Laurent et al, Cancer Res 2011; 71', '666). Despite its role in the metastatic process of various cancers, its mechanism of action and its intracellular substrates remain largely unknown. It has been shown that the anchorage of PRL-3 to the plasma membrane plays an important role in the metastatic process, suggesting that the phosphatase regulates transmembrane substrates. Among potential targets involved in extracellular matrix adhesion, we focused on integrin 1 which we found overexpressed in the transcriptomic analysis of our uveal melanoma cohort.We showed that FTI-277, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor that prevents PRL-3 anchorage to the plasma membrane, abolishes PRL-3-induced OCM1 cell migration on collagen I in vitro, specifically enhances the spreading of OCM1 cells overexpressing PRL-3, and allows the formation of large focal adhesions involving integrin 1. Knockdown of integrin 1 in OCM1-PRL3 cells partially restores the spreading and migration. Furthermore, in focal adhesions, we observed that PRL-3 specifically regulates the aggregation of integrin 1 but does not affect integrin 3. Our results suggest the involvement of integrin 1 in PRL-3-mediated cell migration. To go further, we are currently investigating the phosphorylation status of specific integrin 1 residues, known to be involved in cell adhesion. The present study highlights the importance of PRL-3 membrane localization in uveal melanoma cell migration, by regulating adhesion to the extracellular matrix through integrin 1.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma is an aggressive and deadly skin cancer that causes the majority of skin cancer related deaths, and is increasing rapidly in children. As melanoma is a highly metastatic cancer, an approach that could reduce its metastatic potential, may facilitate the development of an effective strategy for its prevention or treatment. To develop more effective chemopreventive agents for the prevention of metastatic melanoma, we determined the effect of honokiol, a phytochemical from Magnolia plant, on the migratory potential of melanoma cells and the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects using Hs294t and SK-Mel 28 cell lines as an in vitro model. Nox1 is a member of NADPH oxidase (Nox) family, consists both cytosolic and membrane bound subunits, and play a role in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Nox1 generated ROS contributes to cell migration through an increase in the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Here, first we checked the protein level (Nox1) and enzymatic activity (Nox) in melanoma cells and compared with normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEM) and found elevated. Overexpression of Nox1 in melanoma cells was associated with increased migration rate in comparison to NHEM, as determined by cell migration assay. Treatment with diphenyliodonium chloride (DPI, an inhibitor of Nox1) significantly decreases migration potential of melanoma cells. We also found that the treatment of melanoma cells with honokiol reduced the expression of Nox1, and caused significant reduction in cell migration potential. The increased expression of MMPs (2 and 9) is resultant of ROS production by Nox1, which played an important role in cell migration. Honokiol treatment to melanoma cells inhibits MMPs expression. To verify the observations, the Hs294t and SK-Mel 28 cells were treated with DPI, and n-acetyl cysteine, an antioxidant. A reduction in the level of MMPs and cell migration was observed. Further, we examined the effect of honokiol on Nox activity, and the levels of core proteins (p22phox and p47phox) of complex using Hs294t and SK-Mel 28 cells. It was found that treatment of melanoma cells with honokiol not only reduced the Nox activity, but also reduced the binding of p22phox to p47phox proteins through increasing the cytoplasmic accumulation of p47phox protein and decreases the expression level of membrane bound protein p22phox. Together, these results indicate that honokiol acts as a Nox1 inhibitor, and has the ability to inhibit melanoma cell migration by targeting the Nox1-mediated ROS production. This new insight into the anti-melanoma cell migration activity of honokiol could serve as a basis for development of improved chemopreventive or therapeutic strategies for metastatic melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma delivers immune suppressive stimuli through PDL-1. FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is an immunophilin capable of immune suppression. We, previously, demonstrated a relevant role for this protein in melanoma biology and progression. Melanoma also expresses a splicing variant of FKBP51 (isoform 2 or ISO2), whose function is unknown. Aim of this study was to generate knowledge on the mechanism regulating PDL-1 expression in melanoma, and find biomarkers predictive of response to immunotherapy. We generated melanoma cells overexpressing the canonical FKBP51 or ISO2, and measured levels of PDL-1. Flow cytometry showed that expression of PDL1 in ISO2-melanoma (41.5+4.2%) was significantly higher than expression in control cells (15.5+4.7%) or melanoma overexpressing the canonical FKBP51 (23.2+5.7%). These results suggested a role for ISO2 in regulation of PDL-1 expression, that was confirmed in another tumor cell line, namely HeLa. Western blot assay showed different bands of PDL-1 (around 70kD, 50kD and 37kD). The band at 70kD was present in the tumor, but not in lymphocytes and, reasonably, corresponded to the form exposed on the membrane. This 70kD band was particularly upregulated in ISO2-melanoma. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) express a strong immunohistochemistry signal for FKBP51. Since a molecular mimicry suits melanoma and lymphocytes, we investigated whether PBMCs of melanoma patients, that are a good a source of TIL, expressed the two isoforms. We measured, by QPCR, isoforms levels in PBMCs of 70 healthy donors, 92 primary melanoma and 60 metastatic melanoma patients. Our results show that expression of ISO2, but not canonical FKBP51, was significantly higher in PBMCs of patients than in PBMCs of controls (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.0001). In addition, ISO2 expression in PBMCs from metastatic melanoma patients (range 7.0-36.0 au) was significantly higher than expression in PBMCs from primary melanoma (range 1.0-3.5 au)(p<0-007). Healthy donors PBMCs expressed ISO2 when cocultured with melanoma and such expression changed in accordance with PDL-1 expression on melanoma, as suggested by PDL-1 knockdown experiments. Moreover, ISO2 resulted increased in PBMCs cultured with PDL-1 recombinant protein, but not BSA. These findings suggested that the increased expression of ISO2 in PBMCs of melanoma patients was stimulated by the interaction between the tumor and PBMCs, through PDL-1/PD1. In conclusion, our results show that 1) ISO2, a splicing variant of FKBP51, upregulates expression of PDL1 in melanoma; 2) PDL1-PD1 interaction between tumor and lymphocytes induces ISO2 in lymphocytes; 3) increased ISO2 levels were measured in PBMCs of 152 melanoma patients; 4) ISO2 levels were especially high in PBMCs of advanced melanoma patients. Collectively, our results suggest ISO2 is a promising melanoma biomarker related to PDL-1.']",

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest human gene family, are known to be activated by ligands such as, thrombin, chemokines or glutamate, and have been shown to be important regulators of signaling pathways. Dysregulation via overexpression of diverse GPCRs has been well documented in primary and metastatic tumors cells such as breast, lung, prostate and gastric tumors, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma (1), however, knowledge of their genetic alterations is limited especially in malignant melanoma. Thus, further analysis of this gene family is warranted to determine if GPCR proteins play a role in melanomagenesis. In our current study, we used exon capture and illumina sequencing methods to analyze the mutational status of all the GPCRs in melanoma. This investigation revealed that one family member, GRM3 was frequently mutated in melanoma and that one of its mutations clustered within one position (Glu870Lys). Biochemical analysis of GRM3 alterations revealed that mutant GRM3 selectively regulated the phosphorylation of MEK leading to increased anchorage-independent growth and migration. In vivo studies revealed that overexpression of mutant forms of GRM3 result in increased lung macrometastases; whereas depletion of GRM3 in cells expressing mutant forms of GRM3 resulted in reduced xenograft tumor formation compared to equivalently treated wild type GRM3 cells. Furthermore, melanoma cells expressing mutant forms of GRM3 had reduced cell growth and reduced cellular migration after shRNA-mediated knockdown of GRM3 or treatment with a selective MEK inhibitor, AZD-6244, which is currently being used in phase II clinical trials. Our study yields a comprehensive map of genetic alterations in the GPCR gene family and suggests a potential novel therapeutic target for melanoma patients.']",

Exhausted T cells are characterized by', ' 1) an over expression of inhibitory receptors or exhaustion markers such as CTLA-4, PD-1 and Tim-3; 2) a loss of function (cytotoxicity, cytokine production and proliferation); 3) a down-regulation of cytokine receptors, rendering them refractory to cytokine stimulation; and 4) changes in transcription factors, including downregulation of T-bet expression. T cell exhaustion has been extensively studied in the context of chronic infectious diseases and different types of cancer, however little is known about exhaustion of NK cells in the same background. NK cells, innate immune cells that eliminate tumors through cytotoxicity and IFN- production, have a key role in immune surveillance of tumors, including melanoma. In this study, we characterize and compare the phenotype of NK cells from patients with melanoma of different stages (I, II, III, IV) and healthy donors.METHODS', ' We compared NK cells from 10 patients with melanoma at each stage of presentation (I, II, III, IV) and from 20 healthy donors as it relates to membrane expression of activating (NKG2D and NKp46) and inhibitory receptors (KIRB1 and KIRNKAT2), function (cytotoxicity, IFN- production and proliferation) and the intracellular expression of the transcription factor T-bet. NK cells cytotoxicity was measured by Lamp-1 expression using K562 cells as target cells. IFN- production was measured after 4h stimulation with rhIL-12. Proliferation was quantified by CFSE after 6 days in the presence of rhIL-2.RESULTS', ' As the stage of the melanoma advanced we observed a pattern of gradual increase of inhibitory receptors (with a higher difference between stage II and stage III) and a concomitant decrease of activating receptors (with a higher difference between stage III and stage IV). With regard to the three most important NK cell functions, IFN- production and proliferation were impaired beginning with stage I and advancing to stage IV, while cytotoxicity was reduced only at stage III and stage IV. Similarly, T-bet expression also began to decrease at stage III.CONCLUSIONS', ' These data suggest that NK cells from melanoma patients gradually develop a phenotypic and functional profile consistent with exhaustion, beginning with stage I and advancing to stage IV. The exhaustion phenotype begins with initial loss of IFN- production and proliferation ability, and finally cytotoxicity. Therefore, the concept that NK cells also become exhausted make them an interesting population to target therapeutically. Furthermore, as the exhaustion phenotype is acquired progressively through the stages, and not exclusive to stage IV, it may be possible to intervene early in the course of tumor progression.']",

Thus, the research of downstream factors and interaction proteins of FTO may identification of the mechanism FTO participated in and discovery of the FTO pathway may provide a noval evidence to the diagnosis and put forward new targets for the treatment of melanoma. Recent reports show that there is an important link between FTO and melanoma cancer. Our recent studies find that there are differences of FTO expression between normal skin and melanoma cancer. First of all, higher FTO protein expression was detected by western blot in melanoma cancer cells, compared with primary cultured normal skin cells. However, the mRNA expression of both normal tissue and melanoma cancer are at the similar level. Secondly, FTO expression was also investigated in 80 clinical samples. Compared with normal skin tissues, malignant melanoma tissues had stronger positive immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of FTO in nucleus, and IHC scoring confirmed the significantly higher FTO protein expression in carcinoma tissues. In the normal skin tissues, FTO only expressed in basal nuclei; but in the melanoma cancer, FTO expressed in the dermal cells both at the nucleus and membrane. Especially, the expression of FTO is closely related with the pathological staging of melanoma. The increased FTO expression in melanoma carcinoma suggested that aberrant FTO expression may be an early molecular event in cancer development.

The metastatic cascade represents a multi-step process which includes several cellular and molecular processes including cell migration and invasion. Tumor cells can migrate either collectively, in a mesenchymal or in an amoeboid type of movement. The role of microfilaments is essential in mesenchymal migration, where it acts in the formation of membrane protrusions, and amoeboid migration, where they play a key role in cell contraction. In this context, the present work aimed to analyze the effects of the marine sponge-derived drug jaspamide, which has well-known properties on cytoskeleton (anti-polymerizing of the actin microfilaments). After the determination of the IC50 concentrations for the HT144 (derived from human melanoma) and NGM (from human benign nevus) cell lines, the effects of the treatment with jaspamide were studied through wound assays, transwell assays, Boyden's chamber assays, fluorescent cytochemistry, immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The treatments demonstrated the drug acts disorganizing the microfilament cytoskeleton in a dose-dependent way, leading the accumulation of F-actin in the perinuclear region. The wound assays indicated that drug treatment impaired the migration ability of both cell lines. However assays in Boyden's chambers showed increasing in cell migration in consequence of jaspamide treatment, result that could be explained by switch of the migration strategy from mesenchymal to ameboid. This fact was corroborated by the decreased expression of the IRSp53 protein after jaspamide treatment meanwhile MT1-MMP expression is not affected by the treatment. By treating thecell lines with the compounds Y-27632 or NSC23766 in addition to jaspamide, it is possible to conclude that NGM cells use mainly the RAc signaling pathway to control cellular migration process.

However, Cav1s function in the melanoma microenvironment of primary tumors and of metastasis remains largely unexplored. Here, we devise various experimental approaches to elucidate the function of stromal Cav1 in the development of melanoma in mice.

We use cocultures of fibroblasts and melanoma cells coupled with cytokine analysis to identify various Cav1 regulated factors that function in a paracrine fashion in melanoma. Cav1KO fibroblasts secrete increased amount of ShhN, bFGF, and MMP2/3, cytokines known to promote proliferation of melanoma cells and remodeling of the tumor stroma during melanomagenesis. Intradermal xenografts of fibroblasts and melanoma cells (5', '1 ratios) confirmed the tumor promoting role of fibroblasts lacking Cav1.

PNA oligonucleotides bind to DNA over 1000-fold more avidly than its native complement, are completely resistant to intra and extra cellular enzymatic degradation, show no nonspecific toxicity at therapeutic levels, and when conjugated to delivery peptides can be made nuclear and cell membrane permeable. We have employed these PNA oligomers to target BRAFV600E which is prevalent in cutaneous melanoma in a sequence-specific complementary manner so as to disrupt transcription by strand invasion. For these studies, we have developed a novel delivery peptide conjugated to PNA modified to increase both cellular delivery and PNA stability towards its target. Our results indicate that exposure of the melanoma cell lines to a modified PNA-peptide conjugate selective for BRAFV600E results in a concentration-dependent inhibition of cell growth that is specific for the BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cell lines with an IC50 range of 250 to 500 nM. Moreover, there is no inhibition of BRAFWT cell growth at these concentrations. This is associated with suppression of BRAFV600E protein over time with no effect on BRAFWT protein levels. Furthermore, BRAFV600E protein expression was suppressed for up to 6 days following initial exposure proving the durability of this type of inhibition. Exposure to this modified PNA-peptide down-regulates BRAFV600E mRNA transcription exclusively in the mutant cell lines. Live cell imaging of BRAFV600E mutant cells confirms localization of fluorescein-labeled PNA-delivery peptide specific to BRAFV600E to the nucleus within 3 hours of treatment.

Therefore, we investigated the importance of IGF-1/IGF-1R interaction in hepatic metastases.Methods', ' The expression pattern of IGF-1R in hepatic metastases of uveal melanoma was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a series of archival samples from patients treated at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. To investigate the biological role of exogenous and endogenous IGF-1 on the growth of a uveal melanoma, a long-term, cell line obtained from a hepatic metastasis (TJU-UM001) was evaluated concurrently.Results', ' All 24 metastases stained positive by IGF-1R. Tumors showed 80-95% of cellular staining while adjacent normal liver showed negative staining. IGF-1R was expressed in both the cytoplasm and the exterior membrane of uveal melanoma cells. As previously reported (AACR 2010, Abstract #359), more than 90% of TJU-UM001 cells expressed IGF-1R on their surface and did so at approximately 1.2 x 104 IGF-1R per TJU-UM001 cell. The cell proliferation assay (Quick Cell Proliferation Assay Kit II; BioVision, Mountain View, CA) showed that quiescent TJU-UM001 was induced to proliferate by 2.6-fold (p<0.001) in response to exogenous IGF-1 at 300 ng/ml. Conversely, anti-IGF-1R antibody completely blocked the exogenous IGF-1-induced growth of TJU-UM001. IGF-1 preferentially induced phosphorylation of Akt (S473) in quiescent TJU-UM001 cells and this was blocked by anti-IGF-1R antibody. Cell proliferation kinetics analysis showed TJU-UM001 grows briskly in serum-free medium (SFM) and anti-IGF-1R antibody significantly inhibited growth. Correspondingly, TJU-UM001 maintained in SFM expressed mRNA for IGF-1 and furthermore secreted IGF-1 protein. Both anti-IGF-1 and anti-IGF-1R antibodies independently inhibited the spontaneous proliferation of the cells in SFM (p<0.05) suggesting a critical role for endogenous IGF-1 expressed by TJU-UM001 cells.Conclusion', ' Although the strong and extensive expression of IGF-1R in archival tissue specimens suggests paracrine stimulation via IGF-1R as a major mechanism of the growth of uveal melanoma in the liver, cell proliferation in SFM and the endogenous production of IGF-1 by tumor cells indicate an autocrine mechanism via IGF-1R is also operative.

The human high molecular weight melanoma associated antigen (HMW-MAA), a membrane-bound protein over-expressed in > 90% of melanomas, is thought to contribute to melanoma growth and metastasis. A number of studies indicate the merit of blocking these tumor-promoting functions by antibodies. Most antibodies for cancer therapy in clinical use belong to the IgG class, the most prevalent class in blood. IgE antibodies, characterised for their role in allergic responses and protection against parasites, function through high-affinity Fc receptors. IgE antibodies, naturally reside in tissues where they exert immunological surveillance, a different spectrum of effector cells, and offer a novel therapeutic approach by targeting solid tumors such as melanoma. Previous studies, suggest that IgE antibodies are more effective than the corresponding IgGs in eliciting anti-tumural immune responses, with our lead antibody candidate against the tumour antigen Folate Receptor alpha (FRa) presently in clinical development. We wished to elucidate whether this concept can be applied to the treatment of melanoma. To test this, we engineered IgG1, IgG4 and IgE antibodies of the same specificity against HMW-MAA and examined their functionality in activating immune effector cells against cancer cells. IgG1 and IgE antibodies induced significant tumor cell death by two mechanisms', ' antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro, using patient-derived monocytes and monocytes from healthy volunteers.

In vivo, SBI-089410 attenuated the growth of Braf/Cdkn2a/Pten tumors in a syngeneic B6 mouse model, as well as prevented their resistance to BRAFi.

        "Background":"['The over-expression of c-Met and activation by its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), are known to cause significant tumor development and metastasis in human melanoma. Hence, c-Met is an attractive target for molecular therapeutic inhibition. To assess c-Met inhibition, we studied the effects of c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in RU melanoma cells and found that JNJ38877605 and SU11274 (c-Met TKIs) inhibited cell growth in RU cells with an IC50 of 0.5 and 1M, respectively. We then tested the therapeutic effects of JNJ38877605 in vivo. Five million RU melanoma cells were injected subcutaneously into the hind flanks of nude mice. Tumors were allowed to develop for a week after which daily oral treatments of 20 mg/kg JNJ38877605 or vehicle were given. We found that JNJ38877605 decreased the size of RU tumor xenografts in nude mice by 6 fold compared to mice treated with a vehicle control. Unfortunately, while c-Met inhibitors have been successful in clinical trials, acquired resistance to c-Met TKIs (ARQ197) and antibodies (MetMab) has been observed in cancer patients, resulting in tumor recurrence or lack of tumor CR. To determine the mechanism of c-Met TKI resistance, two melanoma cell line models, MU and RU, were exposed to increasing concentrations of SU11274. They proliferated in 7-10 fold higher concentrations of SU11274, and were cross resistant to 12 fold higher concentrations of JNJ38877605. After generating resistant cells, we measured HGF production and the expression levels of p-c-Met (Y1003) and p-c-Met (Y1234/1235) by immunoblotting to compare parental and resistant cells. We found that MU resistant cells exhibited upregulation of p-c-Met (Y1003) (6 fold) and p-c-met (Y1234/1235) (4 fold) compared to parental cells after treatment with HGF. Additionally, p-c-Met (Y1234/1235) was stable for only 30 min in parental cells compared to 60 min in resistant cells, where it was upregulated by 3-fold. This might be due to defects in c-Met ubiquitination resulting in its being recycled back or stabilized onto the membrane. Interestingly, we found that RU parental cells secreted 2 fold more HGF than the resistant cells. This indicates that resistant RU cells may not be as dependent on HGF induced activation in comparison to parental cells. In MU and RU resistant cells, we also found upregulation of p-mTOR (2 and 8 fold, respectively). Upregulation of phospho-pS6kinase (2 fold) and p-4E-BP1 (4 fold), downstream targets of p-mTOR, were also seen in MU cells. MU resistant cells also expressed increases in active -catenin (protein downstream of Wnt signaling pathway) by 5 fold under no HGF stimulation and 2 fold after 60 min of HGF treatment. Our data indicates that the oral c-Met TKI, JNJ38877605, could be a promising therapeutic option for treating HGF producing melanoma tumors, but its effects could be further enhanced by the addition of mTOR and/or Wnt inhibitors to counteract acquired c-Met TKI resistance.']",

TnTs have been observed in neoplastic and normal cells, and may transport soluble proteins, such as P-glycoprotein (MDR1), lipids, and whole organelles, including mitochondria and Golgi vesicles, between cells. Furthermore, TnTs mediate intercellular Ca2+ signals and transmit electrical potentials. However, their functional characterization remains incomplete.Objectives', ' Our objective is to describe TnT formation and function in melanoma cell lines and primary tumor samples.Methods', ' We describe the presence and composition of TnTs between cells in the melanoma cell lines SK-Mel-31, DM440, DM443, DM738, and DM598 in vitro with a combination of brightfield and fluorescent microscopy techniques. TnT formation is assessed in response to hypoxia, glucose stress, and low pH. Bulk intercellular transport of mitochondria is quantified via flow cytometry using MitotrackerTM dyes, and GFP-GRP78 fusion proteins are used for studies of protein transport. Additional flow cytometric studies include JC-1 staining to measure mitochondrial membrane potential, annexin V binding to measure apoptosis, and 7-AAD exclusion for live/dead staining. Fluorescent ATP assays are used to measure general metabolic capacity, and confocal microscopy of primary melanoma specimens is performed using melanosome-specific (P100) and dsDNA (H33342) stains.Results All tested cell lines formed TnT-like structures with variable F-actin and tubulin composition. Mitochondria and Golgi vesicles were visible within live and fixed TnTs, which were formed constitutively and were further induced by hypoxia, glucose stress, and low pH. In an actin-dependent process, cells rapidly transferred labeled mitochondria, achieving homogeneity within 24 h as measured by flow cytometry. Transfer of healthy mitochondria from unstressed cells significantly mitigated the acute toxicity of chemotherapeutically damaged cells. GRP78 was also rapidly transferred between cells, and the transfer of GRP78 from healthy donor cells rescued cells damaged by chemotherapeutics as measured by a decreased apoptotic rate.Conclusions', ' Here, we report for the first time, the characterization of TnTs between melanoma cells. Moreover, melanoma cells acquired primary and secondary chemotherapeutic resistance to alkylating agents melphalan and temozolomide and the BRAFV600E inhibitor, vemurafenib, via bulk intercellular transfer of functional mitochondria and the ER stress protein, GRP78.

MEDI0680 is a humanized immunoglobulin gamma 4, kappa monoclonal antibody specific for human PD-1 that blocks PD-L1 and programmed cell death ligand-2 (PD-L2). Blocking both PD-L1 and PD-L2 may provide more efficient pathway inhibition and may be more specific for different tumor groups in comparison to blocking either one alone.

        "Background":"['Exosomes play a crucial role in the progression of cancer through the transport of a variety molecular cargo, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, to and from cells as a means of intercellular communication. Unraveling mechanisms of exosome-cell interactions may open avenues for studying cellular communication and lead to new therapies. Cellular exosome uptake depends on cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains called lipid rafts. Non-specific depletion of lipid raft cholesterol reduces cellular exosome uptake; however, to our knowledge, no targeted mechanism of inhibiting cellular exosome uptake has been reported. Scavenger receptor type B-1 (SR-B1) localizes to lipid rafts, and is a high-affinity receptor for cholesterol-rich high-density lipoproteins (HDL). SR-B1 is an intriguing therapeutic target because it is upregulated in many different cancers due to the high need for cholesterol of rapidly dividing cancer cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that specific targeting of SR-B1 and modulation of cholesterol flux through this receptor with biomimetic HDL-like nanoparticles (HDL NPs) would disrupt cellular exosome uptake. As a model, we explored exosomes derived from melanoma cells as they have been shown to promote angiogenesis and immunosuppression both crucial events in melanoma progression. Melanoma exosomes have also been shown to actively prepare metastatic sites, creating a suitable microenvironment allowing for the development of metastasis. Because of this, targeting exosomes and intercellular signaling could be beneficial for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Using a variety of techniques including confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and automated image analysis, data demonstrate that HDL NPs specifically target SR-B1 in lipid rafts in melanoma cells and modulate cholesterol flux through this receptor. This leads to a clustering of SR-B1 at the cell membrane and potent inhibition of the cellular uptake of melanoma cell-derived exosomes.']",

Here, we report that STIM1- and Orai1- mediated Ca2+ oscillations promote melanoma invasion by orchestrating invadopodium assembly and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Ca2+ oscillation signals facilitate invadopodial precursor assembly by activating Pyk2 phosphorylation at tyrosine 402, which directly binds to and activates Src to promote invadopoium assembly. Disruption of Ca2+ oscillations inhibited invadopodium assembly. Futhermore, STIM1 and Orai1 regulate the proteolysis activity of individual invadopodium. Mechanistically, Orai1 blockade inhibits the recycling of MT1-MMP to the plasma membrane and entraps MT1-MMP in the endocytic compartment to inhibit ECM degradation. STIM1 knockdown significantly inhibited melanoma lung metastasis in a xenograft mouse model, implicating the importance of this pathway in metastatic dissemination. Our findings provide a novel mechanism for Ca2+ -mediated cancer cell invasion and shed new light on the spatiotemporal organization of store-operated Ca2+ signals during melanoma invasion and metastasis.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

        "Background":"['Arf6 is a member of the Ras-superfamily of small GTPases and controls membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal remodeling, functioning mainly in endocytosis pathways at the cell periphery. Arf6 is activated by various extracellular signals and oncogenic events and has been shown to promote cell migration and pro-invasive phenotype in human cancer cells. Small molecule inhibition of ARF6 reduces spontaneous metastasis in xenograft models of human cutaneous melanoma, suggesting that ARF6 is necessary for disease progression. Using a genetically-engineered mouse model of BRAF-mutant melanoma, we determined whether activation of Arf6 is sufficient to induce spontaneous metastasis in vivo. For melanocyte-specific primary tumor induction, Cre recombinase was delivered via local injection of RCAS virus into DCT-TVA;Cdkn2alox/lox;BRAFV600E mice. In the experimental mice, a constitutively active mutant form of Arf6 (Q67L) was virally delivered with Cre. In this study, we observed a significant increase in spontaneous metastatic disease burden in Arf6 Q67L mice. Likewise, tail vein injection of melanoma cell lines derived from Arf6 Q67L tumors consistently show a diffuse pattern of pulmonary metastasis compared to controls that show rare, microscopic metastasis. Recently, it has been demonstrated that activation of Akt, but not Pten loss, leads to an aggressive phenotype in melanoma that includes the acquisition of brain metastases. Immunohistochemical analysis of phospho-Akt revealed that Arf6 Q67L is sufficient to induce Akt activation in tumors. In addition, ARF6 is necessary for AKT activation in human melanoma lines. We did not observe brain metastasis in DCT-TVA;Cdkn2alox/lox;BRAFV600E + Arf6 Q67L mice. When we added Ptenlox/lox allele to this genetic background, however, we observed microscopic brain metastases at a low frequency, suggesting that the combination of Pten loss and Arf6 activation reaches a threshold level of Akt activation that is sufficient to cause brain metastasis. Taken together our data indicate that activation of Arf6 is sufficient to potentiate melanoma metastasis, consistent with the proinvasive cellular phenotype attributed to Arf6. In addition, our data suggests a novel signaling mechanism by which Arf6, a small GTPase involved in trafficking, is somehow involved in Akt activation and that this step may be important for the acquisition of metastatic capacity.']",

In this study, the functional significance of Nox5 was assessed in human UACC-257 and WM-852 melanoma cells by generating Nox5-overexpressing and knockdown cells. Stable overexpression of Nox5 in UACC-257 cells resulted in enhanced cell growth, increased BrdU positive cells and decreased protein tyrosine phosphatase activity. Additionally, these cells had increased normoxic Hif-1 expression and decreased p27Kip1 expression. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous Nox5 in UACC-257 cells resulted in decreased cell growth, decreased BrdU positive cells, decreased Hif-1 expression and increased p27Kip1 expression. Likewise, in human WM-852 melanoma cells, transient overexpression of Nox5 decreased p27Kip1 expression and knockdown of endogenous Nox5 resulted in increased p27Kip1 and gamma-H2AX expression with decreased cell growth. Cadherin switch, loss of E-cadherin expression and upregulation of N-cadherin was observed in UACC-257 Nox5 overexpressing cells indicative of an invasive phenotype; conversely, an upregulation of E-cadherin expression in Nox5 knockdown cells was noted. Cell invasion assay through matrigel-coated membranes also demonstrated enhanced invasion by Nox5 overexpressing cells. Additionally, 3D cultures of Nox5 overexpressing UACC-257 cells exhibit an amoeboid morphology compared to that of the Nox5 knockdown cells that were mesenchymal, suggestive of an amoeboid - mesenchymal (AMT) transition. Strikingly, UACC-257 cells that overexpress Nox5 were able to proliferate in serum-free conditions for over a month.

Protein concentration of cell lysates was measured spectrophotometrically (GLO Max Multi+, Promega), using a BCA protein assay kit. The samples were run in SDS PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with antibodies against Hsp 70 (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY), Hsp 90 (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX), pS6 and pBAD (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA).Using MTS assay, we found that DT3 (IC50 38.8 M) and simvastatin (IC50 22.7M) have cytotoxic effects on melanoma cell line SK-MEL-28, but on the SK-MEL-2 cells DT3 does not have an effect at the concentrations studied (10-40 M DT3) yet simvastatin (IC50 16.9 M) does have cytotoxicity. Further studies determined that combinations of these drugs display a synergistic effect on SK-MEL-28 by inhibition of pS6 and pBAD and subsequent apoptosis. However, these effects are not observed in SK-MEL-2 cells; treated SK-MEL-2 cells show over-expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 suggestive of a rescue effect leading to lesser cytotoxic activity. The selective cytotoxicity observed in BRAF-mutated cells and not in wild type BRAF melanoma cell lines by both DT3 and simvastatin warrants further research into the potential therapeutic use of these combinations.

Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is the mechanism of Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space in response to Ca2+ depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). SOCE is regulated by interaction between STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) in the ER and Orai (ORAI calcium release-activated calcium modulator) in the plasma membrane. Our previous studies have demonstrated the presence of SOCE is observed in melanoma cells, and potentially regulates cell migration and cell cycle.

Three weeks after the intravenous injection of SK-Mel-2 cells with knockdown of Orai1 or STIM1 in Balb/c nu/nu mice, the lungs were removed and fixed with picric acid.

Knockdown of STIM1 inhibited proliferation in metastatic melanoma cells (SK-Mel-2, SK-Mel-24 and C8161) (p<0.01), suggesting that SOCE activates proliferation of melanoma. Inhibition of SOCE with knockdown of Orai1 or STIM1 suppressed migration in cell lines tested (SK-Mel-2 and SK-Mel-24) (p<0.01) and the SOCE inhibitors suppressed it in cell lines (SK-Mel-2 and C8161) (p<0.01 for both cell lines), indicating that SOCE regulates melanoma migration.

In order to examine the roleof TRPC3 in human melanoma, Short heparin RNA (shRNA) transductions with lentivirus encoding either TRPC3 or scramble was performed according to the protocols of the manufacture. Secretion level of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 was assessed in the presence of Pyr3, TRPC selective inhibitor or not by gelatin zymography. We transplanted C8161 cells into the side chest of female Balb-c nude mice at the level of intradermal depth. Immediately after tumors were formed, Pyr3 or DMSO (control) was injected intradermaly around the tumor every day. We measured each diameters of tumor every two days, and calculated volume and regression rate.Result', ' mRNA and protein of TRPC3 were expressed in multiple human melanoma celllines and primary tissue. Proliferation rate of TRPC3 knocked down C8161 decreases in 48 hours (p<0.0001). Pyr3, one of pyrazole compounds that is known to inhibit selectively TRPC3, suppressed cell proliferation (IC50 12.99 M). Both knockdown of TRPC3 and Pyr3 decreased path length of migration (p<0.01, p<0.01 respectively). These results suggested that TRPC3 was involved in cell proliferation and migration of C8161. Pyr3 also shortened migration path length by tracking the movement of C8161cells. Secretion level of MMP9 was decreased by Pyr3. Pyr3 inhibited phosphorylation of signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) 5, suggesting that TRPC3-induced proliferation and migration were regulated by, at least in part, the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Tumor volume transplanted on mice side chest was dramatically and immediately reduced by Pyr3 local injection, while that of control group was increased. These results indicated that TRPC3 is involved in cell proliferations not only in vivo but also in vitro.Conclusion', ' TRPC3 regulates proliferation and migration, and thus tumor growth and metastasis of melanoma, suggesting that TRPC3 could be a novel target for treating BRAF wild type humanmelanomas.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

        "Background":"['Anoikis is an anchorage-independent cell death. Resistance to anoikis is one of the key features of metastatic cells. The role of STAT-3 in anoikis resistance in various melanoma cells was analyzed in the current study. Significant proportion of SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-2, MeWo, SK-MEL-5 and B16-F0 cells resisted anoikis when grown under anchorage-independent conditions. Cells that resisted anoikis were observed to a have higher rate of migration and invasion as compared to the cells grown under anchorage dependent conditions. The anoikis resistant cells also exhibited significantly higher expression and phosphorylation of STAT-3 at Tyr 705 than the cells that were attached to the basement membrane. Treatment of these cells with IL-6, a cytokine which phosphorylates STAT-3, prevented the induction of anoikis. STAT-3 inhibitors AG490 and PL induced anoikis in a concentration-dependent manner in anoikis resistant cells, whereas IL-6 blocked anoikis. Over-expression of STAT-3 by transfection in SK-MEL-28 and SK-MEL-2 cells significantly increased the anoikis resistance, confirming the role of STAT-3 in anoikis resistance. On the other hand, silencing STAT-3 in SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-2, SK-MEL-5 and MeWo cells decreased the potential of cancer cells to resist anoikis. Furthermore, STAT-3 (-/-) melanoma cells were more sensitive to anoikis, as compared to cells overexpressing STAT-3 (+/+) cells. STAT-3 (-/-) SK-MEL-28 cells and the SK-MEL-28 cells that were treated with PL completely failed to develop tumors when injected subcutaneously in immune-compromised mice. Moreover, these cells also failed to metastasize when injected intravenously. On the other hand, anoikis resistant wild type cells not only formed aggressive tumors subcutaneously but also highly metastasized when injected intravenously. The metastasis was confirmed by H & E staining. In summary, our results establish STAT-3 as a critical player that renders anoikis resistance to pancreatic cancer cells and enhance their metastasis potential.

Ca2+ homeostasis plays a pivotal role in proliferation in cancer cells, but little is known about the role of Ca2+ in melanoma. Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is defined as Ca2+ entry from extracellular space triggered when Ca2+ store in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is depleted. SOCE is regulated by coordination between Orai (ORAI calcium release-activated calcium modulator) in the plasma membrane, and STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) in the ER. We examined the role of Ca2+ in melanoma cells especially focusing on SOCE. Method', ' Intracellular Ca2+ level was measured by using Fluo4-AM, a Ca2+-sensing fluorescent dye. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Cells were stained with propidium iodide and cell cycle was assessed using flow cytometer. Protein phosphorylation microarray was performed by using a commercially available kit (Cancer Signaling Phospho-Antibody Array). Results', ' SOCE, as demonstrated by enhancement of Ca2+ entry from extracellular space after Ca2+ depletion in the ER, was observed in SK-MEL-2, C8161, SK-MEL-24, UACC257 (human) and B16 (mouse) melanoma cell lines, suggesting that the existence of SOCE is universal among melanoma cells. SOCE was attenuated by Pyr3, a pyrazole compound which is known to inhibit SOCE, as well as by EGTA that chelates extracellular Ca2+. Pyr3 inhibits cellular proliferation in SK-MEL-2 cells (IC50', ' 5.1uM) and C8161 cells (IC50', ' 2.1uM). Cell cycle was analyzed in C8161 cells, and the cell number in the G2 phase was increased by both Pyr3 and EGTA, indicating that SOCE plays a role in the transition of G2/S phase. Protein microarray data showed that Pyr3 reduces phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) by 93%, suggesting that the JAK/STAT pathway may be involved in SOCE-induced alteration of cell cycle.

        "Background":"['The transient receptor potential melastatin-2 (TRPM2) cation channel was previously identified as a potential target in various cancers, where its pharmacologic inhibition caused increased DNA damage and the selective eradication of cancer cells. In this study, we utilized several human primary metastatic melanoma cell lines, in which we analyzed TRPM2 and its isoforms, and evaluated the ability of TRPM2 inhibition to modulate cell death.As TRPM2 is known to exist as a plasma membrane cation channel in noncancerous cells, we investigated the localization of TRPM2 in melanoma cells. In three lines of primary human metastatic melanoma cells, TRPM2 was localized in the nucleus, as compared to an extra-nuclear localization in noncancerous primary epidermal keratinocyes. Because TRPM2 exists in several isoforms in cancer cells, we investigated the cellular localization of these isoforms. Subcellular fractionations demonstrated that only full-length TRPM2 was localized to the nucleus in primary human metastatic melanoma cells, whereas two smaller isoforms were localized exclusively in the cytoplasmic fraction.Treatment with the TRPM2 inhibitor, clotrimazole, caused decreased proliferation in all three lines of primary human metastatic melanoma cells. Further, treatment with the DNA alkylating agent, temozolomide (TMZ), led to increased levels of cell death in melanoma cells pretreated with clotrimazole, but not in noncancerous primary epidermal keratinocyes after pretreatment. Similar increases in cell death were observed after RNAi silencing of TRPM2 followed by TMZ treatment.Taken together, this study demonstrated that TRPM2 inhibition selectively increases cell death in primary human metastatic melanoma cells. Further, the data suggests that, similar to our previous results in breast adenocarcinoma cells, full-length TRPM2 appears to have a novel role in melanoma cell growth and survival. The results therefore suggest that TRPM2 is a potential target in melanoma, where its inhibition may cause the selective eradication of metastatic melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['Metastatic melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer that still has limited treatment options and dismal 5-year year survival rates as low as 15%. Only recently has there been significant progress in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, advent by molecular targeted drugs and immunotherapy, but their limitations are exposed as these cancers are quickly able to develop resistance. Dysregulation of apoptotic machinery in melanoma allows the cancer cells to evade cell death and contributes to treatment resistance. Up-regulation of Mcl-1, a member of the Bcl-2 family of anti-apoptotic proteins, has been correlated with melanoma progression and metastasis. Mcl-1 amplification is one of the most common genetic aberrations found in human cancers and has been labeled as a marker of aggressive oncogenesis and poor patient prognosis. Previous studies have pointed to Mcl-1 as a viable therapeutic target for the treatment of melanoma and conclude that small molecule Mcl-1 inhibitors may appeal this unmet medical need. We have discovered and characterized a new class of selective small molecule Mcl-1 inhibitors using various biochemical, functional, and cell based assays; further development of these compounds allowed us to achieve potent low-nanomolar binding affinity for Mcl-1 and more than 300-fold selectivity over Bcl-2/Bcl-xL. Our most potent inhibitor, 483-LM, was screened across a panel of human melanoma cell lines using a cell proliferation assay and revealed varying levels of sensitivity. A BH3 profiling assay demonstrates that C8161, the cell line most sensitive to our inhibitor, solely relies on Mcl-1 for survival. The Mcl-1 dependence of C8161 might contribute to the known metastatic nature of this cell line. Mechanistic studies revealed that 483-LM effectively engaged the endogenous Mcl-1 protein after treatment of C8161, as determined by a CETSA assay, and prompted disruption of protein-protein interactions between Mcl-1 and several pro-apoptotic proteins, including Bax, Bak and Bim. This was followed by induction of Bax/Bak dependent apoptosis and activation of hallmarks of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, including mitochondrial outer membrane depolarization, caspase activation, and PARP cleavage. Importantly, treatment with 483-LM caused massive up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Noxa, an effect apparent after an 8 hour treatment, which contributes to the induction of cell death. The in vivo efficacy studies with 483-LM showed significant effect on tumor growth and caspase-3 activation in tumor samples. Overall, our data indicate that Mcl-1 inhibitors are a promising treatment option for aggressive metastatic melanoma and warrant further preclinical investigation of 483-LM as a promising selective Mcl-1 inhibitor to be used as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and immunotherapy.']",

It has been shown that nearly 50% of metastatic melanoma secrete IL-6 into the supernatant. Nevertheless until now the stage dependant effects of IL-6 on melanoma cells are not fully understood.Methods', ' The secretion of IL-6 by A375, 518A2 human metastatic melanoma cells was compared with WM 35 cells which derive from an early lesion (radial growth phase) and investigated with ELISA. The sensitivity toward statin induced caspase 3 activation was investigated in these cells in the absence and presence of IL-6 or an anti IL-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab). Apoptosis was also confirmed by FACS analyses for AnnexinV/PI staining and proliferation by cell cycle analysis using PI staining in such treated cells. Phosphorylation of Stat3 and the regulation of pro- (Bax, Bak) and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bxl-XL) were studied by Western blot.Results', ' Melanoma cells derived from late stage lesions (A375, 518A2) secrete high amounts of IL-6 in contrast to WM35 cells. IL-6 signalling is intact in A375, 518A2 and WM 35 cells indicated by IL-6 triggered phosphorylation of Stat-3.Most interestingly, the A375 and 518A2 cells show a high sensitivity to simvastatin induced apoptosis with EC50 of 0,52 M (518A2) and 1,7 M (A375) in contrast to WM35 cells which are more resistant (EC50 16 M). Co-treatment with IL-6 leads to an augmentation of the statin induced apoptosis in WM35 cells. Statin induced apoptosis can be mediated by the intrinsic apoptotic pathway which requires the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. This is often alleviated by a downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Interestingly IL-6 treatment led to a marked decrease in the amount of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in WM35 cells which may explain the increased activation of apoptosis.Since A375 and 518A2 secrete high amounts of IL-6 we investigated the effects of the anti IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab. Conversely interruption of the IL-6 signalling with tocilizumab had no effect on the proliferation of 518A2 and A375 cells. Moreover the simvastatin induced caspase 3 activation was not decreased by blockage of the IL-6 signalling.Conclusion', ' Taken together our data prove different sensitivities of melanoma cells from various stages to statin induced apoptosis. Moreover, IL-6 facilitates apoptosis in early stage melanoma cells by the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins. Nevertheless, these pro-apoptotic effects of IL-6 are not observed in metastatic melanoma cells indicating a stage specific role of IL-6 in the development and tumorigenesis of melanoma.']",

It has been identified as an oncogenic driver in various malignancies and is currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic target. To date, MET exon 14 skipping by sequencing and MET amplification by FISH have been found to have potential clinical utility in predicting those patients who may derive benefit from MET-targeted therapy. However, little research has been conducted on alternative technologies to FISH such as CISH, which does not require a dark room and can be interpreted by a board-certified pathologist. The purpose of this study is to report our experience with MET amplification across solid tumors using CISH.A retrospective analysis was done on 26,619 specimens analyzed for MET amplification by CISH at a CLIA-certified lab (Caris Life Sciences). The validated CISH assay, previously validated against a FISH assay, utilized a gene copy number > 5 to assess amplification. Concordance and correlative studies were done in MET-amplified, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens analyzed using a cMET IHC (SP44, 2+ or 3+ staining intensity in 50% or more tumor cell membrane) analyzing protein expression. Correlative studies involving co-existing aberrations, including PD-L1 (SP142, any intensity in at least 50% of tumor cells), in this MET-amplified, NSCLC cohort were also performed.MET amplification utilizing CISH was 0.7% (188/26,619) overall. MET-amplified solid tumors included carcinomas such as NSCLC (3.1%, 87/2767), gastric adenocarcinoma (3.8%, 11/293), esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (3.3%, 11/338), and endometrial carcinoma (0.4%, 9/2020) along with non-carcinomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (1.0%, 5/510), uterine sarcoma (1.3%, 5/400), melanoma (0.4%, 2/538), and rare tumors such as placental-site trophoblastic tumor (100%, 1/1) and prostatic neuroendocrine tumor (100%, 1/1). A sub-analysis of MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens demonstrated co-occurring protein overexpression in 92.6% (75/81) of cases. These same MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens were found to have EGFR pathogenic/presumed pathogenic mutations (19.7%, 15/76), ALK rearrangements (2.5%, 2/80), and PD-L1 overexpression (27.5%, 14/51). ROS1 rearrangements were not detected in this NSCLC cohort (0%, 0/76).Our data suggest MET amplification detection utilizing CISH is a viable option for identifying MET-driven cancers. The presence of MET across various solid tumors contrasts with biomarkers like HER2, which are exclusive to carcinomas. A sub-analysis of our NSCLC population shows MET-amplified tumors contains a similar molecular distribution to the general NSCLC population. Future studies should incorporate MET CISH in clinical trials utilizing MET-targeted agents to determine its potential as a predictive test for evaluating who may derive the most benefit.']",

Drug encapsulation and delivery through nanocarriers can offer many advantages over free drugs, as prevention of drug degradation, control of drug pharmacokinetic and biodistribution, and improvement of intracellular penetration, as well as drug solubilization. However, regardless of the type of approach, the organs of the mononuclear phagocytic system efficiently clear the particles from circulation while protein opsonization often prevents the proper interaction between targeting ligands and target biomarkers. Most cancers are characterized by inflammation and increased leukocyte infiltration. The surface of the leukocyte, in fact, is enriched with transmembrane proteins that determine self-tolerance, adhesion, and negotiation of the inflamed vascular barrier. Leveraging on leukocyte ability to efficiently recognize and infiltrate the tumor tissues, we developed a liposome-like Biomimetic Vesicle (BioV), formulated with leukocyte membrane proteins able to provide extended biocompatibility, self-tolerance and targeting. We hypothesize that the transferring of leukocyte membrane proteins on the surface on a nanovesicle will enhance BioV selective targeting towards the tumor-associated vasculature, increase payload's accumulation, and improve cancer specific cytotoxicity. C57BL mice were intradermally injected with B16 cells. Intravital microscopy and typical tumor growth inhibition curve associated with histological analysis were used to assess BioV targeting and efficacy, respectively in comparison with conventional liposomes and free drug. Once the tumor reached 70-100 mm3, mice were randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 10) and treated with saline (CTRL), free doxorubicin (DOX), empty and DOX-loaded liposomes, empty and DOX-loaded BioVs, at a drug concentration of 7 mg/Kg. Melanoma-bearing mice were treated once per week for one month, and tumor volume and survival rate were investigated. Compared to the other groups, BioVs showed higher tumor targeting and DOX accumulation, increased antitumor efficacy, and prolonged survival rate. Histological analysis on tumor slides showed increased apoptosis and reduced immune cell infiltration in the groups treated with BioVs. We believe that BioV represents a promising drug delivery system possessing advantageous biomimetic properties.

        "Background":"['Once melanoma has metastasized to distant sites it has proved difficult to treat by a variety of chemotherapeutic and biological agents. Significant advances have been made in identifying subgroups of patients with activating mutations in signalling pathway proteins. In particular, the finding that approximately 50% of melanoma have V600E mutations in the BRAF serine/threonine kinase has resulted in the generation of a number of new drugs which target the mutated active form of BRAF. One of these drugs, Vemurafenib (PLX4032/RG704) has shown significant promise in prolonging survival compared to standard chemotherapy, however reports of patient relapse has prompted investigation into means of overcoming acquired resistance to the agent. We report here that efficacy of the PLX4032 analogue, PLX4720, is greatly enhanced by co-treatment with the BH3 mimetic, ABT-737. Treatment with either agent is able to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells, however the kinetics are typically slow, with cell death occurring 48 or 72 hours post treatment. In this study, while either agent was largely ineffective as a single treatment 24 hours following treatment, addition of the combination of drugs rapidly induced significant killing. We show that apoptosis was caspase-dependent, in that inhibition of caspase activation almost totally blocked induction of cell death by the combination of agents. Apoptosis was also associated with activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, with reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-9. Exposure of melanoma cells to PLX4720 rapidly decreased phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bim, resulting in strong upregulation as early as 6 hours after addition of the compound. Strong upregulation of Bim was shown by RNAi knockdown to play an important role in sensitizing cells to co-treatment with ABT-737, by assisting in the inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins.

        "Background":"['Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a phospholipid normally residing in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and becomes exposed abundantly on tumor endothelial cells, tumor-secreted microvesicles, and tumor cells in response to chemo- and radiotherapy. Extensive studies have shown that PS is a global immune checkpoint and major contributor to tumor immunosuppression, which promotes the expansion of immunosuppressive cells, such MDSC and M2 macrophages, inhibits DCs maturation, while stimulates them to secrete immunosuppressive mediators. We have shown that PS targeting can override PS-mediated immunosuppression, reactivate innate tumor immunity, and evoke adaptive antitumor immunity. In the present study, we assessed the antitumor effect of the combination of PS blockade and anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 antibodies in B16 and K1735 melanoma models. Both combinations showed significantly superior tumor growth inhibition over single treatment, with many mice achieving complete tumor regression. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the combination treatment had significantly greater total and functional tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T, more IL-2- and IFN-producing splenic T cells, and lower number of splenic MDSCs than did single treatment. In addition, the ratio of M2 to M1 in the tumor was significantly lower in the combination treatment than that in single treatment. Finally, no toxicity was observed in any of the treatment groups following multiple treatment doses. These data suggest that combination of PS blockade with immune checkpoint blockade promotes strong, localized, enhanced therapeutic efficacy without the side-effects of systemic immune activation and represents a promising combinatorial strategy for cancer immunotherapy. A chimeric PS-targeting antibody, bavituximab, is being used in combination with chemotherapy to treat patients with solid tumors in multiple late-stage clinical trials. These data support our Phase I IST evaluation of our PS-targeting antibody bavituximab in combination with ipilimumab in advanced melanoma patients.']",

        "Background":"['Cancer cells utilize amino acids to satisfy their need for nutrients and fuel their accelerated growth. The amino acid glutamine has been identified as one of the key building blocks in cancer cells, utilized for macromolecular synthesis and energy production. Due to the increased requirement for glutamine and other amino acids, cancer cells commonly increase expression of amino acid transporters, such as SLC1A5 (ASCT2). Amino acid transporters are membrane transport proteins that are used by cells to move important amino acids in and out of the cell. Interestingly, most amino acid transporters are upregulated in cancer to ensure continued access to nutrients.We have recently shown that ASCT2 plays a critical role in regulating glutamine uptake in melanoma, prostate and breast cancer. Many other glutamine transporters are upregulated in different cancers, including SLC38 family members SNAT1, SNAT2 and SNAT3. The role of SLC38A4 (SNAT4) in amino acid uptake and cancer growth, however, has not been examined. Like the other SNATs, SNAT4 is a sodium-dependent amino acid transporter that transports neutral amino acids, such as alanine, across the plasma membrane, although it has low affinity for glutamine. Interestingly, unlike the other SNAT family members, our analysis showed that SNAT4 expression is downregulated in 879/917 cancer cell lines in Oncomine. Analysis of SNAT4 mutations in patient samples using cBioPortal showed infrequent mutations in the majority of cancers. However, the TCGA melanoma data (cBioPortal) showed that 32 of 278 melanoma cases (11.5%) have a point mutation in SNAT4 suggesting an important role in melanoma. These mutations included 9 SNAT4 hotspot mutations, present in 2-4 patients each. Using a SNAT4 homology model to predict loss-of-function mutants, we selected five of these mutations to assess in a SNAT4 transport assay in Xenopus oocytes. Two of the five hotspot mutations (G31E, S76F, G78E, G150E and S371F) were able to completely inactivate SNAT4 alanine transport in oocytes. Further analysis of 52 melanoma patient samples in Oncomine showed SNAT4 downregulation in all patients, suggesting that, in contrast to most amino acid transporters, SNAT4 plays a tumor suppressor role in melanoma.We are currently examining these mutations in melanoma cell lines to determine their effects on cell growth. We are also examining how SNAT4 is involved in either the import or export of amino acids and the downstream metabolic consequences that may directly inhibit melanoma cell growth. Through this research we will gain a better understanding of the role of SNAT4- mediated amino acid metabolism in preventing melanoma cell growth.']",

        "Background":"['New therapies of metastatic melanoma, including BRAF inhibitors, check-point blockade or adoptive T-cell transfer, hold high promise. However, their efficacy remains unsatisfactory. Combination of different modalities offers an opportunity to enhance their effect. We studied mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR) previously implicated in synergistic effect of cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Approximately 50% of human melanomas bear the activating mutation V600E in BRAF that can be selectively targeted with BRAF inhibitor PLX4720. We have observed that in vitro treatment of human V600E-positive melanoma cells 451Lu and WM983B leads to a dose-dependent up-regulation of mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR) in the cell surface. An increase in cell surface MPR, enhanced recombinant Granzyme B uptake, a requirements for effective combination with immunotherapy. This effect of PLX4720 on MPR expression was reproduced in a mouse model featuring xenograft 451Lu-derived subcutaneous tumors. This effect was limited only to sensitive cell lines, disappearing completely after resistance had been induced by extended treatment with growing doses of the drug. We have previously determined that autophagy has a key role in MPR up-regulation after chemotherapy or radiation therapy. However, in the case of PLX4720, autophagy occurs 1-2 days after the start of the treatment while membrane MPR was up-regulated not early than 3-4 and 10-14 days after the start of the treatment in 451Lu and WM983B cells respectively. In addition, autophagy was present independently of whether the cells were resistant to PLX4720 or not. These data indicate that autophagy was probably not responsible in PLX4720 inducible up-regulation of MPR. We observed a parallel changes in MPR up-regulation and phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization in live melanoma cells. PS and MPR co-localized on cell surface after the treatment with PLX4720. Co-incubation of PLX4720 with PS-specific antibody resulted in an ablation of the subsequent membrane MPR up-regulation.

Methods', ' The role of EMMPRIN on endothelial cells (HUVEC and HMEC-1) and primary melanoma cells (WM278 and M10) was demonstrated by silencing its expression with siRNA and by treatment with exogenously added EMMPRIN-enriched membrane vesicles and the resultant effect on VEGFR-2 was observed at the RNA and protein level and using functional in vitro assays and in vivo studies.

        "Background":"['Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and this occurs when tumor cells invade basement membranes and blood vessels to colonize other tissues. Metastasis is facilitated by extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading structures called invadopodia. Recently, several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as tumor and metastasis suppressor genes. Loss of expression of miR-206 has been correlated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer, breast cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma and melanoma. A previous study by others has demonstrated that restoring miR-206 expression in human breast cancer cells was sufficient to block metastasis in tumor xenograft assays. However, the targets of miR-206 that cause metastasis in these cancer models have not been fully characterized. Here, we have tested the effects of miR-206 on invadopodia in metastatic cancer cells, and identified a novel target that may explain this effect. Transducer of Cdc42-mediated Actin assembly-1 (Toca-1) is an adaptor protein that promotes formation of invadopodia and metastasis in breast cancer models, and has a predicted miR-206 binding site within the 3 UTR of Toca-1 transcripts. To test whether the high levels of Toca-1 expression that we have observed in metastatic cancer cell lines was due to loss of miR-206, we rescued miR-206 expression using transient, stable or inducible approaches in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer, A375 melanoma, and H1299 lung cancer cell lines. In each cell model, Toca-1 expression was reduced upon miR-206 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, thus validating Toca-1 as a new target of miR-206. Further testing of the phenotypes induced by miR-206 rescue revealed dramatic defects in ECM degradation and cell invasion in breast cancer and melanoma cell models. In subcutaneous tumor xenograft assays, stable rescue of miR-206 in H1299 tumors led to defects in tumor growth compared to those expressing a scrambled control miRNA. In addition, miR-206 expression caused a dramatic reduction in the numbers of lung metastases. We are currently extending this to our melanoma models and inducible models to define changes in metastasis-related targets of miR-206 that are aberrantly expressed in metastatic cancers. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time a link between miR-206 and suppression of invadopodia formation via Toca-1 silencing, which likely contributes to the metastasis suppressing activity of miR-206 in multiple cancer types.']",

Using a yeast-based functional screening system, we identified interferon gamma receptor 2 (IFNgR2) as a novel Bax suppressor. IFNgR2 is known to heterodimerize with IFNgR1 to form a functional IFNg receptor complex. In addition to this function, we showed that the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of IFNgR2 can bind to Bax and inhibit the conformational change that is required for Bax activation. Furthermore, this anti-Bax activity does not require IFNgR1 or Jak-STAT signaling, which suggests that IFNgR2 has a previously unrecognized biological identity as an apoptosis inhibitor that is independent to its function as an IFNg receptor subunit. In this study, the physiological significance of anti-Bax activity of IFNgR2 was determined in prostate cancer and melanoma. Using immunocytochemistry and subcellular cell fractionation, we found that IFNgR2 was mainly detected in the intracellular membranes (i.e. ER, mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus), whereas IFNgR2 expression in the plasma membrane was barely detectable in all of the cancer cell lines (8 cell lines) examined. Strong immunostaining of IFNgR2 localizing in the intracellular space of malignant cells was also observed in prostate cancer and melanoma tissue sections. We examined the expression levels of IFNgR2, IFNgR1, Bax, and Bcl-2 by Western blot and ELISA. The approximate concentrations were IFNgR2=100-600 pg/ug total protein, IFNgR1=0.1-1 pg/ug total protein, Bax=100-800 pg/ug total protein, and Bcl-2=30-100 pg/ug total protein. IFNgR2 expression levels were significantly higher than IFNgR1, much more than the 1', '1 ratio required for functional IFNg receptors. Importantly, IFNgR2 levels were comparable to that of Bax and Bcl-2. These results suggest that there are abundant IFNgR2 molecules free from IFNgR1 in cancer cells, and IFNgR2 is expressed at a sufficiently high level to function as a Bax inhibitor. Furthermore, short hairpin-RNA-mediated knockdown of IFNgR2 significantly stimulated apoptosis induction triggered by taxol, cisplatin, doxorubicin, and ABT-737 (Bcl-2 inhibitor) in prostate cancer (PC3) and melanoma cell lines (WM164 and A375). These results support our hypothesis that IFNgR2 has a physiological role as a Bax inhibitor in cancer cells. We propose that (1) IFNgR2 may become an useful diagnostic marker to predict cell death resistance of prostate cancer and melanoma, and that (2) new technologies suppressing the anti-apoptotic activity of IFNgR2 may be able to improve efficiency of apoptosis induction in these cancer cells.']",

In this study we have investigated the attachment, spreading, and migration of B16F10 cells that have been genetically modified to express the GPR4 receptor at a high level (named B16F10/GPR4 cells). The results showed that upon stimulation of GPR4 in B16F10/GPR4 cells with low pH, cell spreading, membrane ruffling, and migration were significantly decreased. The phosphorylation levels of paxillin Y118 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) Y397 following one-hour cell attachment were also decreased, and the spatial localization of the phosphorylated paxillin and FAK was substantially altered. Further tests were performed to identify the G-protein signaling pathway responsible for this effect. By using a G13 dominant negative construct or inhibiting Rho activation with C3 transferase (CT04) in B16F10/GPR4 cells, the cell spreading and membrane ruffling abilities were almost completely restored back to the level of B16F10/vector control cells, whereas the inhibition of the Gs and Gq pathways had little effect.

The protein expression of glycolysis-associated transporters was also influenced by changes in LDH-A expression with Lac High cells showing a significantly higher protein expression of MCT1 and MCT4. The general expression of GLUT1 was unchanged (Western Blot) but membrane localization was higher in Lac High cells (immunofluorescence staining). Measuring metabolite content in experimental tumors of the same cell lines showed that the cells maintained their glycolytic properties with Lac Low tumors showing lower lactate content than Lac High tumors.In summary, down-regulation of LDH-A expression reduced lactate production and membrane localization of glycolysis-associated transporters. The fact, that these characteristic are maintained during the transition from in vitro to in vivo makes this model system useful for systematic studies on therapeutic manipulation of tumor glycolysis and associated pathways.Supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft KFO262, DE 835/2-1 (WMK) + KR1418/8-1 (MK)']",

        "Background":"[\"Tumors progress in immunocompetent hosts despite the local infiltration of tumor-specific effector T cells. Recent advances have identified ion transport as important for T cell activation and function. We report that the concentration of potassium is markedly elevated within murine and human tumors in comparison to other tissues while other ions are minimally perturbed. Additionally, ex vivo stimulation of effector T cells in hyperkalemic conditions led to profound suppression of T cell activation, cytokine production, and glycolytic metabolism without affecting viability - suggesting a role for potassium in tumor immune evasion. Characterization of this phenomenon with whole-transcriptome RNA-Sequencing revealed that elevated potassium specifically repressed TCR induced transcripts with the effector cytokine interferon gamma (IFN) being among the most depressed. Moreover, hyperkalemia limited TCR induced glucose uptake and consumption, metabolic changes required for full effector function.Prior investigations into the role of potassium transport in cellular physiology have centered on the presumption that the ion's sole function is to maintain cellular membrane potential and calcium influx. However, we find that elevated potassium had no effect on TCR induced calcium signaling. Although hyperkalemia increased the cytoplasmic membrane potential of effector T cells as expected, other methods to similarly depolarize the cell without the addition of extracellular potassium did not produce the inhibitory phenomenon. Therefore, we conclude that the immunosuppressive effect induced by hyperkalemia is independent of potassium's previously understood role in the regulation of cytoplasmic membrane potential and calcium signaling. Causatively, elevated potassium led to blunted serine/threonine phosphorylation within the Akt/mTOR signaling cascade following TCR ligation, while pharmacologic or genetic means to restore Akt signaling rescued effector function.Mechanistically, the suppressive effect of elevated extracellular potassium was directly related to an increase in intracellular levels, and depletion of intracellular potassium restored full T cell activation and cytokine production. T cells genetically reprogrammed to express the potassium efflux channel Kcna3 were resistant to potassium mediated suppression - displaying lower intracellular potassium levels and increased cytokine production. Finally, tumor-specific Kcna3 expressing cells exhibited augmented in vivo intratumoral IFN production, Akt/mTOR signaling, and enhanced anti-tumor activity against established melanoma in tumor bearing mice. These results uncover a novel axis of tumor-induced immune suppression via an ionic checkpoint. The manipulation of cellular ion transport represents an entirely new approach for cancer immunotherapy.\"]",

Recent studies have proposed that Nox5 plays a role in the proliferative capacity of Hairy cell leukemia, Barrett's esophageal adenocarcinoma, and in prostate cancer cells. Although implicated in several malignancies, the role of Nox5 in tumor cell biology is still unclear. This impediment is due to a lack of reliable immunological probes as well as the fact that little is known regarding Nox5 expression in human tumors. In this study, we report for the first time the generation and characterization of a mouse monoclonal antibody against a recombinant Nox5 protein (600-746), and the expression profile of Nox5 in human tumors by tissue microarray analysis. We also report the detection of endogenous Nox5 protein in the UACC-257 human melanoma cell line using our novel Nox5 antibody. Specificity of the antibody for Nox5 was confirmed by generating stable Nox5 over-expressing UACC-257 cell clones, and by transiently silencing both endogenous Nox5 and stably overexpressed Nox5. Additionally, no cross-reactivity of the antibody with other Nox homologs was detected. Sub-cellular fractionation studies revealed that Nox5 was predominantly expressed in the membranes of UACC-257 cells and its Nox5 overexpressing clones. Immunofluorescence, confocal microscopy, and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that Nox5 localizes throughout parental UACC-257 cells and Nox5 overexpressing clones, with perinuclear enhancement. To evaluate the clinical significance of Nox5 in human cancer, we determined the expression of Nox5 protein in a representative set (382 samples) of human tumors. Tissue microarray analysis revealed substantial Nox5 overexpression in several human tumors of epithelial origin including breast, colon, lung, prostate, and ovarian cancers, as well as non-epithelial malignancies (glioblastoma multiforme, melanoma, and lymphoma). Expression was markedly increased in tumors compared to normal tissues of the same organ. Collectively, our study provides the first demonstration of Nox5 overexpression in human tumors by tissue microarray, and reports on the first mouse monoclonal antibody against Nox5.

Stim1 and Orai1 promote tumor cell invasion and degradation of extracellular matrix by promoting the formation of invadopodia. Stim1 and Orai1 regulate invadopodia formation through facilitating SOC calcium influx and activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src. The activation of Src by SOC influx also contributes to anoikis resistance in tumor cells. We were able to further demonstrate that the expression levels of Stim1 correlate with tumor progression and metastasis in multiple solid tumors.

Clinically tested therapies to treat cancer by targeting IL13R2 to date have included a ligand toxin conjugate (IL13-PE) and IL13R2 directed CAR-T cells. Both strategies appear to be well tolerated, although with mixed results in tumor eradication. An alternative strategy for targeting IL13R2 is an IL13R2 x CD3 Dual-Affinity Re-Targeting (DART) bispecific molecule designed to co-engage IL13R2 on tumor cells and cytotoxic T cells through CD3, resulting in killing of tumor cells.Methods. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated using standard immunization protocols followed by binding and epitope binning analyses. Cell binding was performed by flow cytometry and frozen normal and tumor tissues analyses by immunohistochemistry (IHC). In vitro studies were performed with cancer cell lines and primary human T cells or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In vivo studies were performed in immune-deficient tumor-bearing mice co-implanted with activated human T cells or reconstituted with human PBMCs.Results. A panel of mAbs that bind human and cynomolgus monkey IL13R2 proteins were selected, representing a range of binding characteristics and epitope diversity. IHC showed favorable normal vs tumor tissue reactivity, with high levels of IL13R2 expression in glioblastoma and melanoma. The mAb panel was converted to DART molecules with an anti-CD3 arm, assessed for the ability to mediate cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity and cytokine release and a lead selected for humanization and engineering into an IL13R2 x CD3 DART molecule incorporating an Fc domain to prolong circulating half-life. The IL13R2 x CD3 DART protein bound human and cynomolgus IL13R2 (KD = 0.64 nM and 0.5 nM, respectively) and mediated CTL activity against LOX-IMVI (melanoma) and SK-MES-1 (lung adenocarcinoma) target cells. Cytokines (IFN-, IL-10, and TNF-) were released in the presence of IL13R2-expressing target cells and human PBMC, but not with PBMCs alone. Administration of the IL13R2 x CD3 DART molecule (50 g/kg IV for 4 consecutive days) prevented tumor growth when tumor cells (A375 and LOX-IMVI melanoma, U87 glioblastoma, or DAOY medulloblastoma cell lines) were co-mixed with activated human T cells and implanted subcutaneously in NOD/SCID/IL2gamma-chain null mice. Tumor eradication was also observed in NOD/SCID/IL2gamma-chain/MHCI KO mice reconstituted with human PBMCs and bearing established LOX-IMVI melanoma tumors following 2 weekly IV doses of 50 g/kg IL13R2 x CD3 DART molecule.Conclusions', ' Robust in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity for an IL13R2 x CD3 DART protein was demonstrated.

Natural antibodies to the alpha-Gal epitope are responsible for the hyperacute rejection of xenografts in humans. It is proposed that intratumorally administered AGI-134 will incorporate into the cell membranes of the tumor cells, presenting the alpha-Gal epitope for binding of anti-Gal antibodies to the tumor cells. This will initiate an immune response that attacks the injected tumor and, through uptake of immune-complexed tumor antigens by antigen presenting cells, will create a patient-specific, systemic anti-tumor response against distant metastases.Results', ' We demonstrate that AGI-134 incorporates into tumor cell membranes in vitro and that the exposed alpha-Gal epitope binds anti-Gal IgG and IgM antibodies from human serum to the tumor cell surface. Using flow cytometry and a complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay we show that tumor cell opsonization with anti-Gal antibodies leads to deposition of complement proteins C3b and C5b-9, which ultimately leads to tumor cell lysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AGI-134-labeled tumor cells opsonized with human serum proteins are phagocytosed by professional APCs.Using the B16-F10 melanoma model in anti-Gal producing 1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout (GT KO) mice we present data to demonstrate that AGI-134 injection into a primary tumor provides significant dose-dependent protection from the development of established distant lesions. Using GT KO mouse serum we demonstrate in vitro that deposition of complement on AGI-134-labeled mouse tumor cells is both alpha-Gal and anti-Gal dependent. In vivo, we demonstrate that the effect of AGI-134 is due to the alpha-Gal moiety by replacing it with human blood group antigens. The protection from secondary lesions conferred by AGI-134 is long lasting in the GT KO mouse melanoma model (monitored up to 90 days). Importantly, when sub-optimal concentrations of AGI-134 were tested in vivo in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody (RMP1-14), a significant enhancement in efficacy over either of the agents administered alone was observed.']",

We and others have therapeutically exploited this attractive target using IL13-based targeting strategies to deliver bacterial toxins, chemotherapeutics, nanoparticles, viruses and immunotherapy directly to the IL13R2 tumor-restricted biomarker. In past work, we found multiple mutational hotspots on IL13 that (a) abrogated its binding to the physiologically abundant IL13R1/IL4R receptor heterodimer, and (b) increased its binding to the tumor-restricted IL13R2. Based on these findings, we created a delivery platform established as an optimized IL13R2-Targeted Quadruple Mutant of IL13 (TQM13; IL13.E13K/R66D/S69D/K105R) that we demonstrated binds with high affinity towards IL13R2, but not the IL13R1/IL4R receptor heterodimer. Of importance, we demonstrated the ability of radiolabeled TQM13 to target IL13R2-expressing tumors in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET). The objective of this current work was to demonstrate for the first time the in vivo IL13R2-targeted killing effect of our optimized TQM13 ligand genetically fused to a potent derivative of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE).We successfully expressed TQM13 and TQM13-PE proteins in an E. coli expression system, denatured, refolded and purified them via Nickel-based affinity and ion exchange chromatography. We demonstrated IL13R2-specific affinity of TQM13 using a novel IL13R2-inducible system in which B16 melanoma cells expressed varying amounts of IL13R2 in proportion to the concentration of doxycycline. Of importance, the number of induced TQM13 binding sites (in vitro and in vivo) was comparable to the range seen in GBM and other malignancies (50,000-4,500,000 receptors/cell). In addition, we demonstrated that TQM13-PE killed cells in direct proportion to IL13R2 expression. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of TQM13-PE in an orthotopic murine GBM model by injecting mice with 1 g of TQM13-PE intracranially on day 7 and 14 post stereotactic tumor cell implantation. We found a significant increase in survival only in mice bearing IL13R2-expressing orthotopic tumors, in contrast to mice bearing IL13R2-negative tumors.Thus, we have successfully generated an optimized, biomarker-targeted anti-GBM agent that demonstrated specific therapeutic potential against the tumor-associated IL13R2 biomarker in vivo.']",

To investigate in genetically-matched human melanoma cells with wt or mutant p53, responses to', ' a) autophagy inhibitor chloroquine and to glucose-lowering metformin or to hypoxia in glucose-supplemented medium; b) pyruvate in glucose-free medium under normoxia or hypoxia; c) sub-physiological glucose.

Mechanisms influencing response to glucose limitation were studied by specific immune blotting. RESULTS. Lower susceptibility to chloroquine  metformin involving greater basal AMPK activation was seen in physiological 5 mM glucose in mutant p53 cells. These cells were also preferentially protected from prolonged hypoxia by glucose supplementation or by pyruvate supplementation of glucose-free medium under normoxia, but not under hypoxia. Sub-physiological glucose without pyruvate induced apoptosis-associated PARP cleavage irrespective of p53 status. However, treatment with impermeable exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) to remove extracellular superoxide signalling across cell membranes, preferentially counteracted PARP cleavage only in wt p53 cells with lower LDHA expression after 48 hr in 2.5 mM glucose.

        "Background":"['Malignant tumor cells overexpress and release nanosized, lipid-enclosed vesicles referred to as exosomes into body fluids for the primary function of facilitating cell-to-cell communication and transferring vital proteins necessary for survival to other parts of the body, resulting in metastasis. It was found that an increased secretion of exosomes in the peripheral blood is correlated to lung cancer and melanoma metastasis. The hallmarks of exosomes are their highly curved membrane surface (d = 30-100 nm) and their enrichment in the anionic lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer leaflet of the membrane bilayer. These properties may provide unique strategies in designing peptides to selectively target exosomes as potential cancer biomarkers. Some current clinical methods that are being used to classify metastatic patients, such as the biopsy and assays measuring circulating tumor cells, are not reproducible and do not always indicate whether or not treatment is reducing metastasis. Furthermore, these methods involve invasive procedures. We aim to develop a novel, minimally invasive, peptide-based diagnostic tool to detect and measure exosome overexpression in cancer patients. The successful creation of this diagnostic tool for cancer metastasis will help in the proper prognosis and therapy for cancer patients.We rationally chose the effector domain of the intracellular membrane protein myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) as our core molecule based on recent reports that this peptide differentially interacts with nanometer size synthetic lipid vesicles. It has also been shown that MARCKS inserts its five hydrophobic phenylalanine (Phe) residues into the membrane of highly curved synthetic lipid vesicles, and its binding affinity increases with increasing vesicle curvature, presumably corresponding to a larger number of defects on the membrane surface. We hypothesize that as vesicle curvature increases, the Phe residues will insert deeper into the membrane due to more lipid defects exposed on the membrane surface in highly curved vesicles. Five analogs of the MARCKS peptide were synthesized, substituting one Phe residue with a cysteine residue for all 5 Phe positions. The cysteine was then labeled with 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-3-methyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSL), which will be used as a paramagnetic spin label for electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). The depth parameter of insertion of the MTSL into the lipid vesicle membrane at each of the five cysteine positions will be quantified using EPR and will be reported herein.Citation Format', ' Sara K.

This new technique was called electrochemotherapy (ECT). The new treatment is based on the increased bleomycin delivery into tumor cells after cell membrane permeabilization by electric pulses administered locally at the site of superficial tumor localizations. Since 1991 more than 300 articles were published on the argument and experiences from many institutes in Europe seems to be very promising. Actually ECT is used for the treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous tumoral lesions from different tumoral types. Favorable results in treating superficial metastatic lesions have been published with a complete response rate for treated nodules raging from 70% to 90%. Methods', ' In our Institute we treated 75 consecutive patients from 2006 to 2009 for superficial cancer lesions, especially metastatic melanomas (58 patients) and squamous or large basal cell carcinomas (15 patients).

        "Background":"['PHLDA1 (pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A, member 1) has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor gene in multiple cancers such as melanoma and breast cancer but appears to contribute to intestinal tumorigenesis. PHLDA2 is located in a cluster of imprinted genes on chromosome 11p15.5, an important tumor suppressor gene region. Alterations in this region may be associated with multiple cancers. Loss of imprinting of PHLDA2 was found to mediate placental growth retardation. The pleckstrin homology-like domain (PH domain) mediates protein recruitment to cellular membranes, which is of paramount importance for signal transduction. AKT and ERK are important protein kinases that play key roles in multiple cellular processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, transcription and cell migration. Activation and phosphorylation of AKT require binding to PIP through its PH domain. Another family member, PHLDA3 recently has been reported to be a major negative regulator of AKT signaling analogous to PTEN and it was shown that it functions as a negative AKT regulator by the quenching of membrane-bound phosphatidyl-inositol molecules. In our microarray studies of oncogenic EGFR and ErbB2 signaling using erlotinib-treated HCC827, CL-387,785-treated H1975 as well as lapatinib-treated Calu-3 and SKBR-3 cells, PHLDA1 and PHLDA2 were consistently identified as immediately downregulated genes upon oncogenic HER signaling inhibition and this was confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR as well as Western blotting studies. The regulation of PHLDA1/2 by HER signaling inhibition has not been investigated in detail previously. Our results show that the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 significantly induces PHLDA1 expression but inhibits PHLDA2 expression in a time-dependent manner. Transient transfection mediated PHLDA1 over-expression in SKBR3 inhibited AKT activation and siRNA-mediated suppression of PHLDA2 in Calu3 cells dramatically induced ERK activation. Stable transfection mediated PHLDA1 over-expression in breast cancer cells inhibited both anchorage-dependent and independent cell growth in vitro. MTS cell proliferation studies showed that siRNA mediated suppression of PHLDA2 stimulated Calu3 cell growth. Studies are ongoing to test the potential role of PHLDA1/2 on inhibiting the direct activation of AKT by detailed PIP3 quantification studies. Our results provide strong evidence that PHLDA1/2 are downstream targets of HER2 signaling and suggest complex regulation of PHLDA1 and 2 by ERK and PI3K pathways. Our studies also suggest significant growth inhibitory effects for PHLDA1/2 and suggest that they might potentially act competitively with AKT and ERK to perform tumor suppression function. Our studies identify PHLDA1/2 as novel targets for therapeutic modulation in EGFR and ErbB2-driven cancers.']",

Herein, we assess 18F-FDG uptake across V600E mutant and vemurafenib resistant cells. We find that vemurafenib is equally effective at reducing FDG uptake in cell lines harboring either heterozygous or homozygous V600E BRAF but is ineffective in cells with acquired resistance or BRAF WT cells. Combination treatment with MEK inhibitor GDC-0973 results in a highly significant enhancement of efficacy across all twenty lines tested. We show that FDG uptake is driven by Glut-1, and that the membrane localization of the transporter paralleled with drug efficacy. Interestingly, we find that vemurafenib induced increased FDG uptake in cells harboring RAS mutations, as well as in tumors that have acquired vemurafenib drug resistance. Hexokinase II, CRAF, KSR and p-MEK protein levels in sensitive and drug resistant tumors were all associated with decreased measurements of FDG uptake in vivo.

Indeed, TA can be encapsulated into erythrocytes that will be used as carrier to specifically deliver the TA to APC, which will ensure their degradation and presentation to T cells.Materials and Methods', ' The proof of concept was established with Ovalbumin (OVA), tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP2 (melanoma TA) and prostate specific antigen (PSA, prostate TA).

Then, erythrocytes containing TA were intravenously injected to mice concomitantly with Poly(I', 'C) adjuvant. The CTL response was analyzed by IFN ELISPOT and in vivo lysis of TA-expressing target cells injected to immunized mice. Humoral response was assessed by the determination of TA-specific immunoglobulin titer in mouse serum.Results', ' All TA were efficiently encapsulated in erythrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. A strong T-cell response was induced after 2 injections of TA encapsulated in erythrocytes', ' 2g of OVA and 20g of TRP2 induced the in vivo lysis of 97% and 96% of TA-target cells, respectively. By comparison, injections of free antigen induced less than 5% of lysis. Furthermore, a significant number of TA-specific IFN-secreting cells was generated (1585 and 286 cells / 106 cells for TRP2 and PSA, respectively) compared to the free TA (< 80 cells / 106 cells for both TA). In addition, we established a dose-dependent PSA-specific humoral response. Finally, a significant delay of tumor growth was obtained in mice more than twenty days after the subcutaneous implantation of EG7-OVA or B16F10 (melanoma) tumor cell lines, compared to injections with free antigen or control vehicle.Conclusion', ' The use of erythrocytes as TA carrier to specifically deliver antigen to APC and induce efficient immune response against tumor can be a very promising strategy in cancer immunotherapy.']",

Recent publications have shown that tumor cells harboring specific mutations (LKB1, mIDH and others) are more sensitive to Complex I inhibition, compared to cells that do not have these mutations. We have identified an optimized human/mouse cross-reactive Complex I inhibitor that allows profiling of Complex I inhibitors in pharmacological models. We have pursued different approaches based on the literature, an unbiased screen and in-house results generated with the human-specific Complex I inhibitor BAY 872243 to identify sensitive in vivo tumor models.

Melanoma-initiating cells (MIC) have self-renewal capacity, are highly tumorigenic and have been identified using CD133, a cell surface marker consisting of a 5-transmembrane protein. After magnetic sorting with anti-CD133 beads, we determined that CD133+ populations were more resistant than CD133- cells to MEK/BRAF inhibitors, the latter of which are targeted therapies for melanoma currently in clinical trials. In a microarray study, we found that the ABCG2 transporter is upregulated in the CD133+ MIC subpopulations. ABCG2, also known as breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP), is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that facilitates the efflux of xenobiotics at the plasma membrane and is responsible for multidrug resistance in cancer cells. This study therefore aimed to block the ABCG2 transporter using the dual ABCG2/ABCB1 inhibitor elacridar to sensitize the CD133+ subpopulation to MEK/BRAF inhibitors. Three metastatic primary human melanoma cell lines were used to investigate the effects of inhibiting ABCG2 in drug-resistant CD133+ subpopulations. Elacridar was used for in vitro inhibition of ABCG2 prior to addition of single and combination treatments with trametinib (a MEK inhibitor), dabrafenib (a BRAF inhibitor), and mebendazole (an anthelmintic and possibly anticarcinogenic drug). Elacridar sensitized all treatment groups to drug treatment. Combination treatment using both ABCG2 and MEK/BRAF inhibitors at the lowest effective dose could be a potential therapeutic to eliminate the highly aggressive drug-resistant CD133+ MIC subpopulations.']",

They are actin-based structures and promote the degradation of the extracellular matrix by focally localizing matrix metalloproteinases. Accumulating evidence suggests that invadopodia play an important role in local invasion and distant metastasis of malignant tumors. Actinin is an actin-binding protein that forms dimers and crosslinks actin filaments. There are four isoforms of actinin in mammals and they are divided into the muscle type (actinin-2 and -3) and the non-muscle type (actinin-1 and -4). Actinin-1 is ubiquitously expressed and involved in the formation of focal adhesions, while actinin-4 is strongly expressed at the invading front of advanced cancers and its expression is correlated with poor prognosis. Although actinin-4 is thought to regulate cell motility and invasion, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Moreover, functional differences between the two isoforms have yet to be fully defined. In this study, we studied the roles of and functional differences between actinin-1 and -4 in invadopodia formation to determine the impact of actinin-4 expression on cancer cells. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that both actinin-1 and -4 clearly localized at invadopodia in RPMI-7951 human melanoma cells and there was no obvious difference in their localization patterns. Likewise, invadopodia formation and degradation of fluorescent gelatin matrix were blocked by siRNA-mediated knockdown of either actinin-1 or -4. In contrast, only actinin-4, but not actinin-1, promoted invadopodia-mediated gelatin degradation activity when overexpressed in RPMI7951 cells. Similar results were obtained when MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and SCC61 human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells were analyzed in the same manner. These results indicate that both actinin-1 and -4 are essential components of invadopodia, but only actinin-4 possesses an ability to promote invadopodia formation.

Recent studies show that elevated autophagy and redox imbalance in melanoma cells contributes to chemotherapeutic resistance, making these biological processes ideal therapeutic targets. However, gaps still exist regarding the mechanism by which pro-oxidant therapeutics affect autophagic signaling and the ultimate impact on melanoma cell fate. We previously demonstrated that pro-oxidant compound Nexrutine (NX) selectively inhibits melanoma cell survival and autophagy through autophagy scaffolding protein SQSTM1/p62. However, the mechanism by which NX-induced oxidative stress inhibits autophagy through p62 remained unknown. Thus, the primary objective of this study was to determine how p62 regulates cell fate during oxidative damage. We used a panel of primary melanocyte and melanoma cells to evaluate i) proteasomal degradation of p62 during oxidative stress-induced autophagy blockade, ii) the requirement for p62 during NX-induced apoptosis, iii) effect of NX-induced superoxide on autophagy and cell survival, iv) association of p62 with caspase-8 during oxidative damage, and v) subcellular localization of NX. Proteasomal degradation was evaluated using MG132 and western blotting for p62 following NX. We used genetic approaches (RNAi and overexpression using HA-p62) to determine the role of p62 in cell fate as determined by survival, apoptosis, and autophagy measurements. Fluorescence microscopy was used to determine the subcellular localization of NX. Generation of superoxide was determined using mitoSOX and mitoTEMPO pre-treatment was used to determine specificity. We found that i) NX-induced ROS inhibits p62 protein by stimulating proteasomal degradation, ii) p62 mediates apoptosis in response to high levels of oxidative damage through caspase-8 iii) NX generates superoxide which inhibits autophagy and melanoma cell survival, and iv) NX accumulates selectively in mitochondria. Overall, we show that oxidative stress induced by NX occurs upstream of its inhibitory effect on p62, autophagy and cell survival. Further, we demonstrate that NX induces superoxide, which leads to autophagy inhibition through increased p62 degradation, that ultimately inhibits melanoma cell survival, while not affecting primary melanocytes. We also show that p62 mediates apoptosis through increased association with caspase-8 in melanoma cells during superoxide generated by NX. We also demonstrate for the first time that NX localizes to mitochondria of melanoma cells and results in membrane potential loss due to its generation of high amounts of superoxide. This study demonstrates that pro-oxidants like NX can successfully target two pro-survival melanoma features simultaneously and may be useful melanoma therapeutic agents.

Elastin-like polypeptide (ELP)-based drug delivery has been utilized for various applications including cancer therapies for many years. Genetic incorporation of internalization ligands and cell targeting peptides along with ELP polymer enhanced tumor accumulation and retention time as well as stability and activities of the drug conjugates. Herein, we described a unique delivery system comprised of genetically engineered ELP incorporated with multiple copies of IL-4 receptor targeting peptide (AP1) periodically and proapoptotic peptide (KLAKLAK)2 referred to as AP1-ELP-KLAK. It triggered thermal responsive self-assembly into a nanoparticle-like structure at physiological body temperature and stabilized its helical conformation, which is critical for its membrane disrupting activities. Increased IL-4 receptor specific cellular internalization was associated with the enhanced cytotoxic effect of (KLAKLAK)2 peptide. Additionally, multivalent presentation of targeting ligands by AP1-ELP-KLAK significantly enhanced intratumoral localization and prolonged the retention time compared to ELP-KLAK, non-targeted control. Systemic administration of AP1-ELP-KLAK significantly inhibited tumor growth by provoking cell apoptosis in MDA-MB231 breast cancer and B16F10 melanoma tumor xenograft models without any specific organ toxicity. Thus, our newly designed AP1-ELP-KLAK polymer nanoparticle is a promising candidate for effective cancer therapy and due to the simple preparative procedures of ELPs, this platform can be used as a good carrier for tumor-specific delivery of other therapeutics.']",

        "Background":"[\"Although ceramide has potent tumor suppressor properties, its use in cancer therapeutics has been limited; this is mainly due to rapid metabolism of ceramide by cancer cells, the inability to attain therapeutic levels when ceramide-generating agents are employed, and the inherent insolubility of ceramide as a therapeutic. Our approach circumvents these disadvantages and provides advantages over existing methodologies. For example, rather than promoting intracellular ceramide generation by application of exogenous drugs that activate de novo and sphingomyelinase pathways, we have chosen to administer ceramide exogenously in the form of short-chain C6-ceramide nanoliposomes; this overcomes solubility issues and improves uptake. In addition, nanoliposomes are efficient platforms for delivering other hydrophobic chemotherapeutics. The antiestrogen tamoxifen was selected for our studies because of its unusual off-target actions, which include inhibition of ceramide metabolism at glycosylation and hydrolysis. Blocking these junctures increases C6-ceramide intracellular residence time and diminishes production of sphingosine 1-phosphate, a mitogenic lipid derived via the action of ceramidase and sphingosine kinase. Hence, C6-ceramide and tamoxifen make up a versatile drug duo. Using in vitro models of human colon and breast cancer, acute mylogenous leukemia (AML), and melanoma, we show that simultaneous administration of nanoliposomal C6-ceramide and tamoxifen potently and synergistically decreased cell viability, compared to the single agents. The mix induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest at G1 and G2, upregulation of JNK, p38, and p53, and downregulation of Akt and survivin. In triple negative, hormone-insensitive breast cancer cells, C6-ceramide-tamoxifen induced cell cycle arrest, caspase-dependent apoptosis, and lysosomal and mitochondrial membrane permeability. Evaluation of single agents showed that tamoxifen elicited lysosomal membrane permeability and inhibited acid ceramidase. We have obtained similar results in in vitro models of human melanoma and AML. In an in vivo retroviral transduced murine AML model, the combination lowered leukemia burden in spleen and marrow. The combination also perpetuated synergistic increases in long-chain ceramides, likely compounding the overall ceramide effect. Of interest regarding in vivo utility, the major metabolites of tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen, were effective in combination with C6-ceramide. Our findings show that tamoxifen magnifies the antiproliferative effects of C6-ceramide via aggregate mechanisms.

The tetraspanins are proteins that are involved in several biological processes including cell proliferation, adhesion, invasion and migration. Their reduction or lack of expression is frequently reported in metastatic and poor prognosis tumors. Our aim was to analyze CD9, CD63 and CD82 tetraspanins expression profile in vulvar carcinoma compared to normal tissue. Methods', \" All samples were obtained from Pathology Department of Hospital A. C. Camargo, Sao Paulo, Brazil. TMA block was constructed with 150 paraffin-embedded samples and was used in immunohistochemical assay. The tissue sections were incubated with specific antibodies against CD9, CD63 and CD82, following manufacturer's instruction. The slides were evaluated and scored semiquantitatively by assessing the staining intensity in tumor cells and the frequency of positive cells. Results\", ' The Immunohistochemical analysis showed that all tetraspanins were expressed in tumor samples with different intensity and frequency. CD63 were expressed by a higher samples number (90%), with stronger staining both cytoplasm (79%) and nucleus (11%). Lack of CD63 expression was described in metastatic melanomas lesions, while no metastatic lesions shows higher levels of this protein. Seventy five percent of our samples expressed CD9, exclusively on cellular membrane. CD82 showed positive reaction in 45% of the samples with weakly or moderate staining, both nucleus and cytoplasm. The association of the downregulation of CD9 and/or CD82 with a worse prognosis has been shown in breast, cervical, endometrial, esophageal, head and neck, and others carcinomas. Moreover, CD82 is considered to be an important metastasis suppressor. Conclusion', ' Our preliminary results showed that tetraspanins may have an important role in vulvar carcinomas and CD82/CD63 nuclear expression must be better investigated. Further analyses are ongoing.']",
