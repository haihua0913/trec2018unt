As melanoma is highly immunogenic, here we tested whether TMB associates with immune recognition during tumor progression, hence impacting melanoma overall survival (OS), independently of IT treatment. Methods', ' We have generated somatic mutation data from 314 IT-naive metastatic melanomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In the TCGA cohort, TMB has been calculated for 210 genes (200GS) previously established from TMB studies of anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1/PD-L1 IT. For validation, we have sequenced exonic regions of 20 genes (20GS) with the highest TMB among 200GS in 89 IT-naive metastatic melanomas ascertained at New York University Langone Medical Center. The TMB was defined using total number of somatic, non-synonymous mutations in either 200GS (TCGA discovery) or 20GS (validation), respectively. For discovery and validation cohorts, OS from primary diagnosis of samples with high TMB was compared against low TMB, using thresholds established in previous studies. Results', ' We found that total TMB predicts better OS (p = 0.03, HR = 2.64) in TCGA melanomas. Restricting the analysis only to the established 200GS, this association became more significant in all patients (p = 0.01, HR = 2.67) as well as in patients without IT (p = 0.01, HR = 2.67). In the validation stage of 89 melanomas without prior IT treatment, a high TMB in a subset of 20GS accurately determined favorable OS (p = 0.02, HR = 2.69) and confirmed TCGA observations from the 200GS. Conclusions', ' Here we show, for the first time, that in addition to IT, high TMB predicts more favorable OS in patients that never received IT, potentially serving as a novel marker of prognosis of melanoma and likely other immunogenic tumors at early stages. In addition, our study suggests that TMB test can be robust when applied to only a small subset of genes that trigger significantly higher immunogenicity. This may also eventually assist with accurate sub-selection of early stage patients likely to respond to IT regimens.']",

Increased tumor neo-antigenic burden has been linked to PD1/PD-L1 therapeutic response in several conditions including metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma and microsatellite instable (MSI-H) colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the challenges and high cost associated with neo-antigen discovery has shifted focus towards more efficient methods of response stratification. As such, mutational burden determination from whole exome sequencing and comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) has emerged as a potential solution. In CRC, MSI-H may serve as a predictive biomarker for activity of PD1/PD-L1 therapy, reflecting an unquantified immunogenic mutational burden. Herein, we explore the ability to quantify tumor mutational burden (TMB) as a potential predictive biomarker of PD1/PD-L1 therapy in CRC. Methods', ' Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue sections from 2013 cases of CRC were sequenced with CGP (FoundationOne assay). MSI status and PD-L1 gene amplification were determined as previously described. TMB was calculated by counting mutations across a 1.25Mb region spanning 315 genes. Patients were classified as TMB high or low using the top quartile threshold and microsatellite instable (MSI-H) or stable (MSS) using a computational algorithm developed by Foundation Medicine. Results', ' MSS tumors were observed in 1934 of 2013 (95.2%) cases and MSI-H tumors were observed in 79 of 2013 (3.9%) cases. 79 of 79 (100%) MSI-H cases were TMB high (range 16.8-72.7 mut./Mb) and 1510 of 1934 (78.1%) MSS cases were TMB low (range 0.0-8.0 mut./Mb). Consequently, 424 of 1934 (21.9%) MSS cases were confirmed as TMB high (range 8.8-43.1 mut./Mb). Of note, less than 0.1% of cases featured PD-L1 gene amplifications. Conclusions', ' Tumor mutational burden as estimated by CGP, as opposed to MSI assessment alone, significantly increases the number of patients with metastatic CRC who may benefit from checkpoint inhibitor based therapeutic approaches. Investigations to validate this biomarker are ongoing.']",

Methods', ' Comprehensive genomic profiling of DNA from FFPE tissue samples was performed using hybrid-capture, next-generation sequencing. TMB was calculated by counting all coding short variant alterations (base substitutions and indels), including synonymous alterations, and subtracting from this functionally oncogenic or germline alterations (per ExAC, dbSNPT, or internal algorithmic analysis). To calculate the TMB per Mb, the total number of relevant mutations is divided by the coding region of the bait set (0.8 Mb, 1.1 Mb, or 1.2 Mb). High, intermediate, and low TMB were defined as 20 mut/Mb, 6 and <20 mut/Mb, or <6 mut/Mb, respectively. Tumor types with >100 samples were analyzed.

We also describe the landscape of TMB observed from > 60,000 advanced clinical cancer specimens, across > 400 cancer types. Methods', ' CGP by hybridization capture and high-coverage sequencing (median > 500x) of the full coding regions from 236 or 315 cancer-related genes was performed. Base substitutions, indels, copy number alterations and gene fusion/rearrangements were assessed. TMB was calculated as the number of somatic, coding, base sub. and indel alterations, excluding known driver mutations, per megabase of genome examined. This metric correlates with response to anti-PD-1 in melanoma. Results', ' We validate that targeted sequencing of 1.25 Mb does provide an accurate measurement of genome-wide TMB. We describe the spectrum of TMB observed across a diversity of tumor types. Lower grade and pediatric malignancies tend to have the lowest TMB ( < 1 mut/MB), while epithelial cancers, associated with environmental DNA damage, were most highly mutated ( > 10 mut/MB). Mutations in mismatch-repair genes (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2 and RAD50), DNA replication genes (POLD1, POLE) and TP53BP1 were associated with > 2x increases in TMB, though some specimens with high TMB lacked identifiable causative alterations. Several tumor types, in which ICI are not yet approved, had many cases with high TMB ( > 20 mut/MB), including intestinal type stomach adenocarcinoma (20%), and uterine endometrial adenocarcinoma (16%).

With the low rate of survival for distant metastatic patients with melanoma, especially in men, studies aimed at elucidating the immunological and hormonal mechanisms underlying the gender disparity are warranted.Procedures', ' To investigate the gender disparity observed between men and women affected by melanoma, we used an experimental murine model where B16 melanoma cells were injected i.v. into C57BL/6 mice and lung colonization was assessed at day 14. The roles of neutrophils and NK cells were then investigated by specific cell depletion using anti-Ly6G(1A8) and anti-NK1.1 monoclonal antibodies, respectively. Depleting antibodies or control IgG were injected every 3 days, starting one day before melanoma cell injection. To elucidate the role of hormones, ovariectomy or castration surgeries were performed 4 weeks before B16 injection and 60 day slow release pellets were inserted at the time of surgery. Findings were reproduced with a second murine melanoma cell line (YUMM1.7) derived from a genetically engineered mouse harboring human mutations in BrafV600, as well as loss of Cdkn2a and PTEN.Data', ' Compared with males, nave female mice injected with melanoma (B16 or YUMM1.7) cells have higher lung tumor burden, reduced neutrophil infiltration, and decreased NK cell activation. Ovariectomy of female mice did not affect lung tumor burden, indicating that estrogen and progesterone are not protective. Interestingly, castrated males revealed increased lung metastasis and worse survival rates compared with sham male mice, suggesting a protective role for testosterone. Further, testosterone replacement in castrated mice significantly reduced the elevated lung tumor burden to equal levels observed in sham males. Depletion of NK cells greatly increased tumor burden in both male and female mice in a gender independent manner. In contrast, neutrophil depletion increased lung tumor burden only in male mice and had no significant affect in female mice, indicating a potential gender difference in neutrophils. Moreover, neutrophil depletion in male mice also reduced NK activation and IFN- production, suggesting a stimulatory relationship between neutrophils and NK cells.Conclusion', ' Our data indicates that both neutrophils and NK cells are important for the initial response against melanoma colonization of the lung. Neutrophil depletion, as well as our castration data, indicate that there is a gender specific differential response, which may contribute to the gender disparity seen in human melanoma incidence and survival.

We present novel mutations in the promoter of PMS2 that are significantly associated with high TMB. Methods', ' Hybridization capture of 236 or 315 cancer-related genes and select introns from 19 or 28 genes commonly rearranged in cancer was performed on DNA extracted from > 51,000 clinical FFPE cancer specimens and sequenced to high, uniform coverage ( > 500x).

Results', ' TMB assessed via targeted sequencing of ~1.25Mb broadly recapitulates previous results of whole exome TMB analysis. Analysis of recurrent somatic mutations identified common mutations in the promoter of PMS2, a dimerization partner of MLH1 and integral to the DNA mismatch repair complex. Promoter mutations were found in 7.5% of melanoma specimens (n = 101/1,348) and 17% of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCC) (n = 30/175). In both tumor types, PMS2 promoter mutations are the most significant (p < 1e-5, MannWhitney U test) genomic correlate of TMB. Within the melanoma population, median TMB of PMS2 promoter mutant tumors increased > 5-fold (9.5 to 53.3 mutations per Mb). PMS2 promoter mutant cSCC showed a 2-fold increase in TMB over wild type tumors (35.9 to 72.7 mutations per Mb). Conclusions', 'PMS2 promoter mutations extend the small set of known non-coding mutations thought to affect tumor development and highlight the power of large-scale genomic analysis to uncover novel disease mechanisms. Given recent evidence that TMB may be the most sensitive and specific predictor of immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy in a variety of tumor types, further study of PMS2 promoter mutation as a biomarker for immunotherapy selection appears warranted.']",

We evaluated FDG-PET response as predictor of clinical outcome in BRAFi/MEKi nave patients (pts) treated with this combination. Methods', '  FDG-PET scanning was performed in cycle 1 (C1) (day 10-15) and in C2 (day 35-49) of BRIM7. The percentage of the injected dose (%ID) of FDG and metabolic tumor volume (MTV), as measures of tumor burden, and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in up to 5 target lesions, as an indicator of metabolism, were assessed at baseline, C1 and C2.  PFS and OS were analysed by the log rank method. Results', '  35 evaluable BRAFi-nave pts (mean %ID 1.62.9% and mean `MTV 166251 ml) demonstrated a mean reduction in %ID, MTV and SUVmax of 8614%, 7223% and 7618% at C1, respectively, and 9510%, 9212% and 8914% at C2, respectively.  All pts achieved a partial metabolic response (PMR) (> 30% decrease in SUVmax) by C1 with 5 complete metabolic responses (CMR) (14%) in C1 and 17 CMR (51%) in C2. Pts achieving a CMR in C1 had longer PFS when compared to Pts achieving PMR.  Although tumor burden at baseline was not correlated with metabolic response, both %ID and MTV were predictors of OS. Pts with a baseline %ID <median (0.36%) or MTV <median (47.5 ml) had better OS (HR 0.19, p<0.02 and 0.14, p=0.03) compared to pts with >median values. Conclusion', ' Independent of tumor burden, BRAFi/MEKi nave pts treated with vem/cobi achieved a marked, early and progressive metabolic response on FDG-PET consistent with successful inhibition of ERK-signaling. Tumor burden was a predictor of clinical outcome in this small patient cohort with low baseline %ID or MTV associated with longer overall survival; further validation is warranted.

With the low rate of survival for distant metastatic patients with melanoma, especially in men, studies aimed at elucidating the mechanisms underlying metastasis and the gender disparity are warranted. The purpose of this study is to identify the immune cells and cellular interactions that are crucial for initial colonization of metastatic melanoma in a gender dependent manner.Experimental Procedures', ' We used a B16 melanoma metastatic model in which 2105 cells are injected via the tail vein of B6 mice and allowed to colonize for 14 days. Positive organs are analyzed by visual counting of the metastases, extraction of the melanin pigment and measurement by spectrophotometry, and by flow cytometry. To investigate the role of innate immunity, we injected ip either anti-Ly6G, 1A8 (neutrophil depletion), anti NK1.1, PK136 (natural killer [NK] cell depletion) or control IgG every 3 days, starting 1 day before tumor injection. For hormone ablation studies, an LHRH antagonist was injected.Data', ' Nave mice injected with B16 cells revealed that females have higher lung tumor burden than males. Previous castration studies indicate that this may be dependent on androgens. Intriguingly, neutrophil depletion increases tumor burden only in male mice when compared to male IgG and does not significantly affect tumor burden in female mice, indicating a potential gender difference in neutrophils. Neutrophil depletion in male mice also reduced NK activation and IFN- production, indicating a stimulatory relationship between neutrophils and NK cells. A subsequent NK depletion study revealed significantly increased tumor burden in both male and female NK-depleted mice when compared to the gender-matched controls. However, the increased tumor burden normally seen in lungs of females compared to males was still apparent when comparing lungs of NK depleted male mice to NK depleted female mice. This study also revealed that NK cells are crucial for the prevention of liver metastasis as both genders of NK depleted mice revealed multiple melanoma tumor nodules on the surface of the liver.Conclusion', ' Our data indicates that both neutrophils, and to a greater extent, NK cells are important for the initial response against B16 melanoma colonization of the lung and may be necessary to prevent metastasis. For the liver, NK cells were absolutely crucial for the prevention of melanoma colonization in this organ. Neutrophil depletion, as well as our previous castration data, indicated that there is a gender specific differential response of these cells, which may contribute to the gender disparity seen in human incidence and survival. Further, the importance of NK cells in killing of tumor cells indicates a population of patients that may benefit from ex vivo NK expansion therapy currently in clinical trials.']",

The current studies utilize the B16F10 mouse spontaneous melanoma syngeneic transplantable mouse model system. Previous published work with this vaccine platform has indicated the MIP-3 component targets nascent peptides to immature dendritic cells leading to processing by class I and class II MHC pathways. It has further been shown in this tumor system that prophylactic vaccination with the DNA construct alone delayed tumor growth. Other studies have provided evidence that PD-1 or IL-10 neutralizing antibodies enhance immunological melanoma therapies by modulating the tolerogenic tumor microenvironment. First, this study expanded previous results by finding a significant decrease in tumor burden and increase in survival by prophylactic intramuscular electroporation [IM EP] of the DNA vaccine construct. Adding three therapeutic doses of IL-10 given subcutaneously [subQ] at the tumor site to the treatment further increased mouse survival. The development of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses were documented for the first time in this system by Elispot and in-cell ELISA assays. Secondly, a novel therapeutic vaccination protocol was developed by initiating vaccination and antibody therapies after tumor challenge. With this therapeutic protocol, we demonstrated for the first time that vaccine significantly delays tumor burden and increases median survival from 17 to 21 days (p = 0.006). Addition of IL-10 (subQ) and PD-1 (intra-peritoneally) antibodies led to further highly significant decreases in tumor burden and increased median survival from 17 to 25 days (p = 0.0005). Efficient targeting of antigen to immature dendritic cells with a chemokine fusion vaccine offers a potential alternative approach to the ex vivo dendritic cell antigen loading protocols currently undergoing clinical investigation.

Tumor infiltration with PV-10 leads to rapid necrosis of the injected lesion, with complete resolution common within 2-8 weeks.

Recent studies have focused on identifying genomic and immune predictors of response, but consistent, robust biomarkers have yet to be fully characterized.

Chronic exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) was used to increase the number of tumour non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and thus mutational load. Responses to PD-1 blockade were compared between tumours having low (10 SNVs) and high (>100 SNVs) mutation burden and tumours were subsequently subjected to comprehensive molecular and immune profiling using whole exome sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry.Our initial data suggest there is no significant correlation between tumour mutation burden and response in our model of BRAFV600E-driven melanoma, and we will present a detailed analysis of low- and high-mutation burden tumours in light of their response to PD-1 blockade.

Studies have found it to play a key role in tumor growth and neo-vessel formation in numerous cancer types. We are currently evaluating the safety and therapeutic potential of MORAb-004, a humanized monoclonal IgG targeting endosialin/TEM-1, in clinical trials. Because MORAb-004 only recognizes human antigen and has no cross-reactivity with rodent endosialin/TEM-1, we generated a human endosialin/TEM-1 knock-in mouse in order to assess its activity in vivo. Previously, in this transgenic model, we found that MORAb-004 significantly inhibited subcutaneous B16-F10 melanoma progression by 70% when administered intravenously for 5 consecutive days. Moreover, using the Lewis Lung Carcinoma model of metastatic disease our results showed that MORAb-004 had a significant inhibitory effect on the number of lung metastases. For these studies, supporting clinical trials for using MORAb-004 in combination with standard of care chemotherapeutics, we developed a B16-F10 melanoma lung colonization model. In this model, the human endosialin/TEM-1 knock-in mice were implanted intravenously with B16F10 cells adapted for in vivo lung colonization. These mice were treated with Docetaxel, MORAb-004, or the combination of the two agents, respectively. A group of the tumor-bearing mice receiving PBS served as control. At the end of the study, the lungs of each mouse were harvested. A ratio of the area of tumor nodules versus total lung surface area is calculated as tumor burden. MORAb-004, at 50 mg/kg three times weekly for a total of 7 i.v. injections reduced tumor burden by 45%. Treatment of Docetaxel, at 3mg/kg twice weekly for a total of 5 i.p. injections, reduced less than 20% of tumor burden in the lungs. When MORAb004 was added to Docetaxel treatment, a significant enhancement of efficacy was observed. The reduction of tumor nodules in the lungs was increased to approximately 70%. A similar trend is seen in combination therapy where MORAb-004 was added to gemcitabine regimen. Our results demonstrate the ability of MORAb-004 to inhibit tumor growth in a murine model. Moreover, when added to the chemotherapeutic regimen, it significantly enhances the therapeutic effect of traditional chemotherapy.']",

        "Background":"['Desmoplastic melanomas (DMs) comprise 4% of the overall melanoma burden and have a 5-year survival rate of 85%. DMs are dermal tumors characterized by spindled melanocytes situated within abundant desomplastic stroma. These unusual histological features commonly lead to misdiagnosis. Currently, there are no known genetic drivers. A better understanding of the underlying biology of desmoplastic melanoma would provide biomarkers and therapeutic opportunities. Towards this goal, we performed low-coverage genome and high-coverage exome sequencing of 20 DMs in a discovery cohort, followed by targeted sequencing of 293 candidate genes on a validation cohort of 42 cases. Additionally, high-resolution aCGH was performed on samples from both cohorts. A high mutation burden (median 62 mutations/Mb) ranked desmoplastic melanoma among the most highly mutated cancers sequenced to date. Mutation patterns strongly indicate that UV-radiation is the dominant mutagen and implicate a superficially located cell of origin despite their predominantly intradermal presentation. Novel alterations included recurrent promoter mutations and amplification of NF-kappa B inhibitor epsilon, NFKBIE (IkB) in 14.5% of samples. The promoter mutations typically affect both alleles and occur over a highly conserved DNA region. The mutations are predicted to disrupt a canonical Ets Like Factor 1 (ELF1) binding site. In total, these data imply aberrant NF-kappa B signaling as a pathogenic feature of desmoplastic melanoma. Commonly mutated oncogenes in melanomas, in particular BRAF V600E and NRAS Q61K/R, were absent. Instead, other genetic alterations known to activate the MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades were identified in 73% of samples, affecting NF1, CBL, ERBB2, MAP2K1, MAP3K1, BRAF, EGFR, PTPN11, MET, RAC1, SOS2, NRAS, and PIK3CA. Rb and p53 pathway alterations occurred respectively in 71% and 66% of tumors, affecting RB1, FBXW7, CDK4, PPP6C, CCND1, CDKN2A, TP53, and MDM2. Finally, TERT promoter mutations or amplifications occurred in 90% of tumors. The consequences of the mutations on protein expression levels was confirmed by immunostaining for NF1, EGFR, Rb, CDK4, CCND1, p16, p53, and Mdm2. Collectively, many of these oncogenic mutations are potentially druggable. In conclusion, desmoplastic melanomas harbor distinct genetic alterations that explain their unique biology, and this study illuminates genetic biomarkers and nominates targets for therapeutic intervention.']",

Recently the high mutational burden of malignant melanoma was shown to be related to the degree of response to the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab, but mutational burden alone was not sufficient to predict benefit1. Another study has shown NRAS-mutant had a trend to superior outcomes compared with other cohorts in terms of response to therapy with anti-PD1 antibodies and progression-free survival2.

Results', ' Strikingly all 22 pts treated at 3320mg BID had at least a partial metabolic response (PMR- >25% reduction in SUVMax), with 3 achieving complete metabolic response (CMR). In the 19 pts with PMR there was a 843% reduction in target lesion SUVmax, 904% decrease in the % of injected dose (%ID) in all identified disease sites and a decrement in metabolic volume by 795%. In contrast no metabolic responses were seen in the 4 control subjects. The overall RECIST response rate in the cohort of 22 pts was 86%, with 17 PRs and 2 CRs.

        "Background":"['The pathogenic mutations in melanoma have largely been catalogued, but the order of their occurrence is not known. We identified 82 cases of melanocytic neoplasia with two or more histopathologically distinct precursor and descendent portions. These portions spanned several histopathologic stages including benign nevi, intermediate neoplasms such as dysplastic nevi, melanoma in situ, invasive melanoma, and metastatic melanoma. In total, 277 histopathogically distinct areas were microdissected and sequenced using a panel of several hundred cancer-genes at an average of 275-fold coverage. In all cases precursor lesions harbored mutations known to activate the MAPK pathway, most commonly affecting BRAF or NRAS, and thus these were considered initiating mutations. TERT promoter mutations were the earliest secondary mutations to occur, emerging in intermediate neoplasms and in situ melanomas. Bi-allelic CDKN2A mutations and/or deletions arose predominantly at the transition to invasive melanoma. TP53 and PTEN mutations occurred comparatively later in thicker primary melanomas. In the 12 cases in which matched primaries and metastases were sequenced, no pathogenic mutations were specifically associated with the transition to metastatic melanoma, suggesting that metastatic capability was already present in the primary tumors. Unequivocally benign neoplasms, which mostly consisted of conventional nevi, disproportionately harbored BRAFV600E mutations as the only apparent pathogenic alteration. Lesions that were histopathologically intermediate, such as dysplastic nevi, had two or more pathogenic mutations and were enriched for NRAS mutations. These findings provide genetic support for the existence of an intermediate stage of melanocytic neoplasia, resolving a long-standing controversy. We also found that melanomas with different initiating mutations evolve through distinct evolutionary trajectories linked to specific histopathologic precursors. A mutational signature of UV-radiation-induced DNA damage predominated in lesions from all histopathologic stages, implicating UV-radiation in both the initiation and progression of melanoma. The point mutation burden increased steadily from one progression stage to the next, stabilizing once melanomas became invasive. By contrast, copy number alterations only became prevalent at the transition to invasive melanoma. Melanomas evolve from benign lesions linearly, whereas, they show patterns of branched evolution when they evolve from intermediate lesions; this indicates that evolution may accelerate once a melanocytic neoplasm reaches an intermediate stage. In summary, our study outlines a framework of the genetic evolution of melanocytic neoplasms from precursor lesions and unveils the rate-limiting homeostatic factors that become disrupted as neoplasms progress from one stage to the next, as well as the pathogenic factors driving this evolution.']",

Based on this data, a small molecule inhibitor of the candidate signaling pathway was tested to augment the anti-tumor immune response of checkpoint inhibitors in a murine melanoma model.   Results', '    We identified the Wnt5a ligand as a critical mediator -catenin signaling in DCs and of Treg generation in the BRAFV600EPTEN-/-model.

In addition, our work suggests that activation of the -catenin signaling pathway in sentinel lymph node derived DCs correlates with higher tumor burden and inferior clinical outcome.

To address these issues, we investigated the numbers of CTCs in paired arterial (femoral) and venous (antecubital) blood specimens obtained from uveal melanoma patients with hepatic metastases.Methods', ' CTCs in blood specimens were measured in 17 uveal melanoma patients with multiple hepatic metastases, including 10 patients with liver-only metastases and 7 patients with hepatic and extra-hepatic metastases. Peripheral arterial and venous blood specimens were collected at the same time prior to liver directed treatment. CTCs were analyzed using CellTracks Circulating melanoma Cell Kit by CellSearch System. The clinical information and sources of blood specimens were blinded when CTCs were analyzed.Result', ' CTCs were detectable from all 17 arterial blood specimens (100%) (median 5, range 1 to 168). In contrast, much smaller numbers of CTCs were detectable in 52.9% (9/17) of venous blood specimens (median 1, range 0 to 8) from the same patients. In terms of degree of tumor burden, patients who have hepatic as well as extra-hepatic metastasis showed higher numbers of arterial CTCs (median 12, range 5 to 168), compared to patients who have liver-only metastasis (median 4, range 1 to 11). More importantly, there is no significant correlation between numbers of arterial CTCs and the degree of tumor volume in the liver in patients who have liver-only metastases.Conclusions', ' Using this technology, the detection of uveal melanoma cells in peripheral blood is feasible. Peripheral capillary beds effectively filter CTCs from venous blood; thus venous blood might not be the best source for measurement of CTCs in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. The paucity of clinically evident non-hepatic metastases despite the effective filtration by peripheral capillary beds remains unexplained and may be a demonstration of the seed and soil hypothesis. CTCs are a non-invasive source of uveal melanoma cells for evaluating tumor biology. Further investigation is warranted.']",

        "Background":"['Drug resistance is a major problem in clinical treatment of malignant melanoma. A characteristic feature of melanoma is the abnormally high levels of basal free radicals produced in transformed melanosomes when compared to normal melanocytes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate pro-oncogenic signaling pathways that promote cancer progression, metastasis and contribute to chemotherapeutic drug resistance. However, an excessive overload of ROS in cells beyond a certain tolerance limit may trigger oxidative damage and cell death. Thus cellular ROS modulation presents a valuable therapeutic strategy for melanoma. Based on the above observations, we hypothesize that causing ROS agglomeration in cells, either through depletion of antioxidants or by initiating uncontrolled ROS production, is a plausible strategy to selectively kill melanoma cells, and that -phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a natural compound known to disable cellular GSH antioxidant system, will be effective for this purpose. We showed that that PEITC exhibited potent inhibitory effect on malignant melanoma cells with an average IC50 value of approximately 3 M. Interestingly, MEL624 and HS294T cells, which are resistant to existing antitumor agents used in melanoma treatment such as AZD6244 and Vemurafenib, were highly sensitive to PEITC. The cell death was primarily apoptotic; the effect of PEITC could be partially reversed using the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD. Furthermore, treatment of cells with PEITC lead to an aberrant increase in reactive oxygen species levels, as evidenced by FACS analysis using the fluorescent ROS dyes DCF-DA, DAF-FM and dihyroethidium. ROS increase upon PEITC treatment occurred as early as one hour, indicating that seemed to a primary event leading to subsequent cell damage. This increase in ROS was associated with a decrease in the glutathione levels in cells, suggesting that depletion of the glutathione antioxidant could be the reason for the abnormal ROS elevation induced by PEITC. This was further verified by using PEITC in combination with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine, which completely rescued the cells from the toxic effect of PEITC. Importantly, normal melanocytes were minimally sensitive to PEITC. In addition, combination of PEITC with other standard melanoma drugs like carmustine and temozolomide exhibited synergistic effect, suggesting the possibility of using this compound to overcome drug resistance. This was further validated through in vivo studies in mice, where a combination of PEITC with BCNU seemed to reduce the tumor burden. The cytotoxic effect of PEITC was also validated in primary cancer cells isolated from melanoma specimens from patients. Thus PEITC proves to be an effective antimelanoma agent that warrants further investigation.']",

        "Background":"['Approximately 10% of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) cases occur in a familial setting and known high-penetrance melanoma susceptibility genes (CDKN2A, CDK4, BAP1, and TERT) account for melanoma susceptibility in a small proportion of melanoma-prone families. To identify additional high-penetrance susceptibility genes for familial CMM, we performed whole exome sequencing in 101 CMM cases/obligate carriers in 56 unrelated melanoma-prone families recruited from the Romagna area in Italy. We identified a germline founder mutation in Protection Of Telomeres 1(POT1) (g.7', '124493086 C>T, p.S270N) in five unrelated melanoma-prone families. The mutation was also found in a single sporadic CMM case from Romagna out of 1,824 Italian cases examined, but it was not seen in public databases, our internal exome databases of over 1000 subjects, and 878 Spanish CMM cases and 3,489 controls (2,038 Italian and 1,451Spanish) genotyped. POT1 is a component of the telomeric shelterin complex that plays a critical role in maintaining telomere integrity and regulating telomere length. The p.S270N mutation is highly conserved among vertebrates and predicted to be deleterious by most computational programs we evaluated. Carriers of the p.S270N mutation had increased length and heterogeneity as well as increased average number of fragile telomeres in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA compared to age-matched CMM cases (controls) without the mutation. Exome sequencing analysis of Italian families also identified two other rare missense substitutions in POT1 (g.7', '124464052 C>G [p.Q623H] and g.7', '124503540 C>T [p.R137H]) that were found in all cases sequenced in two families. Both missense mutations are absent from public databases and 3,489 genotyped controls, and are predicted to be deleterious by most algorithms. The carriers of these two mutations showed slightly but significantly increased telomere intensity signals and telomere fragility in PBMCs compared to age-matched controls. We further sequenced POT1 exons in 768 CMM cases and 768 controls collected from Italy and we found that CMM cases showed a significant increase in the burden of rare exonic variants compared to controls (OR=5.4, 95% CI=1.5-29.2, P=0.0021). Subsequently, we identified two novel recurrent germline missense mutations in POT1 (g.7', '124499043 C>T, p.D224N and g.7', '124469308 C>G, p.A532P) in American and French familial melanoma cases.

Methods', ' Primary NM and SSM patients prospectively enrolled at NYU (2002 - 2016) were compared to the most recent SEER cohort (1973 - 2012) and analyzed with respect to MSS.

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from 10 metastatic melanomas, of which 8 harbored a hotspot TERT promoter mutation (5 C250T; 2 C228; 1 C242T/C243T) and 2 carried a hypermethylated wild-type TERT promoter were examined. For controls, 9 atypical Spitz tumors with a wild-type unmethylated TERT promoter were also studied. Total RNA was isolated from FFPE tumor tissues and converted to cDNA. TERT expression levels were determined by RT-qPCR by using the TaqMan Gene Expression Assay and normalized with GAPDH as the endogenous control. In the atypical Spitz tumor samples, TERT mRNA expression was undetectable or negligible. In contrast, TERT expression in all melanoma samples was elevated, ranging from 3- to 71-fold (median, 25-fold) when compared to an atypical Spitz tumor as a reference. Our data support that in melanoma, TERT promoter hotspot C250 and C242T/C243T mutations, similar to C228T mutations, correlate with TERT overexpression and that C250 and C242T/C243T mutations likely contribute biologically to tumorigenesis in melanoma.']",

Methods', '  A retrospective analysis of over 1000 melanoma patients treated with anti-PD1/PDL1 therapies among seven institutions (UCLA, MD Anderson, UCSF, Memorial Sloan Kettering, Vanderbilt, Melanoma Institute Australia, and Westmead) was conducted to identify patients with DM. We assessed objective response rates (ORR), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS).  Results', ' We identified 23 patients with stage IV DM (either pure or mixed subtype), 2 with stage M1a, 11 with M1b, and 10 with M1c disease.

Patients whose tumors have a high mutational burden have a better response to anti-CTLA-4 treatment with ipilimumab in melanoma5, and to anti-PD-1 treatment with pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung6 and colorectal cancer7. These results suggest that a sufficiently high non-synonymous somatic mutation burden in the tumor may lead to protein alterations that serve as neo-antigens to stimulate CD8 T-cell immune response. This immune response may be blocked by the tumor by engaging the immune checkpoint pathway, making such tumors especially vulnerable to immune checkpoint disruption. However, the specific criteria to identify patients likely to respond to immune checkpoint therapy have remained elusive so far.Using somatic mutation and RNA-Seq data from TCGA, we propose that there exists a mutational threshold, which we call the Activated Immune Mutational (AIM) Threshold, which can identify patients likely to respond to immune checkpoint therapy. Compared to AIM- patients (potential non-responders), AIM+ patients (potential responders) have tumors that meet four criteria', ' (1) a high non-synonymous mutation burden; (2) a high level of immune infiltration in the tumor; (3) a high CD8 T cell fraction in the leukocyte component of the immune infiltrate plus high expression of the T cell marker CD8A; and (4) a high expression of immune checkpoint genes PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, CTLA-4.We find that in melanoma, endometrial, colon, cervical and breast cancer, a clear AIM threshold satisfying all four criteria exists. The distribution of mutations in AIM- versus AIM+ tumors for these cancers is very different. In the former, there are high frequency somatic mutations in only a few genes, while in the latter, high frequency somatic mutations are found in many genes distributed over the whole genome.Pathological analysis of high-resolution images from 150 TCGA tumors (30 from each of the five tumor types) validated the presence of significantly higher lymphocytic infiltration in the AIM+ tumors compared to AIM- tumors. We show that AIM+ tumors can be identified using sequencing assays which are currently in clinical use.

We could previously show that hyper-activation of the PI3K signaling cascade by genetic knock-out of the counteracting phosphatase PTEN induced an anti-inflammatory phenotype in myeloid cells. This resulted in protection of conditional knock-out mice in models of acute infection and inflammation.A reduction in pro-inflammatory responses could however increase tumor burden. To address this question we induced colitis associated colon cancer in conditional PTEN-KO mice and found an increase in tumor burden and a reduction in survival in male KO mice. This was accompanied by increased numbers of splenic antigen-presenting cells (APC) expressing the immune checkpoint regulators PD-L1 and PD-L2. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis in these cells revealed a shift towards gene expression profiles found in professional APCs capable of cross-presentation. As expected, ex-vivo stimulated T-cells from KO-mice showed a reduction in proliferative capacity. These findings were further substantiated by findings in a second tumor model using implanted B16 melanoma cells. In this model myeloid PTEN-deficient mice showed a decrease in T-cell activation and a reduction in melanoma cell killing capacity.Taken together, our findings show that genetic deletion of PTEN in cells of myeloid origin increases splenic APCs expressing immune checkpoint regulators resulting in a decrease in tumor immune surveillance. Our study shows that PI3K-inhibitors which are currently tested as anti-cancer drugs might have additional beneficial effects on immune cells by shifting their inflammatory phenotype.']",

Novel mutations in other components of this pathway such as MEK1, MEK2, MAP3K5, and MAP3K9 have been reported recently by high-throughput sequencing efforts. In addition, NF1 (neurofibromatosis type 1), one of the Ras GTPase activating proteins (RasGAPs), has been shown to be mutated or suppressed in melanoma. However, importance of other RasGAPs has not been addressed in melanoma.To obtain a comprehensive view of melanoma genomes, we conducted whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 15 metastatic melanomas and matched normal PBMC genomes from 13 melanoma patients. All melanoma genomes from these 13 patients contained at least one mutation in genes of Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway (MAPK1, MAP3K1, MAP4K2, MAP3K14, NRAS, and BRAF). Our whole genome analyses also identified two novel somatic missense mutations (p.Tyr472His and p.Leu481Phe) in or around the PH domain in RASA1 gene. RASA1 (RAS p21 protein activator (GTPase activating protein) 1, also called as p120RasGAP) is a GTPase activation protein that negatively regulates Ras by catalyzing the hydrolysis of active Ras-GTP to inactive Ras-GDP. In this study, we addressed possible roles of RASA1 in melanoma tumorigenesis. To determine RASA1 level in melanocytic lesions, immunohistochemical analysis of RASA1 on human melanoma tissue microarray (TMA) containing nevi (n=34), primary melanomas (n=63), lymph node metastasis (n=35), and distal metastasis (n=29) was performed. This analysis has shown the inverse correlation of RASA1 expression to melanoma progression. Functionally, ectopic expression of RASA1 mutant increased soft-agar colony formation and tumor growth while that of wild-type RASA1 decreased. shRNA-mediated knock down of RASA1 promoted soft-agar colony formation and invasion of melanocytes and melanoma cells with BRAF mutation as a consequence of the elevated Ras activity.Here, we established the functional significance of novel somatic missense mutations in RASA1 identified in our WGS study.

We evaluated the tumors for the primary type of genetic damage. The three signatures that appeared most divergent were CC>TT for UV, (G/A)C(G)>(G/A)T(G) for deamination, and G>T for oxidative damage. UV and deamination appeared inversely proportional, while oxidative damage appeared to be independent of those other two features. KIT and WT had a greater% of non UV high deamination tumoral environments. A fraction of these tumors also had very high oxidative signatures. We then compared 2 KIT subgroups UV vs non UV (absence of CC>TT mutations) for germline ethnicity differences. Asian SNPs were highly increased in non UV subgroup whereas Caucasian SNPs were in UV subgroup. Further, we divided KIT non UV subgroup into deamination and oxidative damage subgroups and compared ethnicity differences. Deamination was significantly higher in Asians whereas oxidative damage was higher in Caucasians. A similar analysis was done to the WT group, where African SNPs were significantly increased in the non UV subgroup and were primarily associated with oxidative damage. This data implies that KIT mutant melanomas develop in a unique genetic and mutational environments and makes this an ideal system to in which study racial disparities at the molecular level.']",

Affording a survey of the wide breadth of genomic lesions found in melanoma, we present here an analysis of the somatic mutations discovered in the sequenced exomes of 121 melanoma tumor-normal pairs. We identify frequent genomic alterations both in genes previously implicated in melanoma (BRAF, NRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN) as well as in several genes whose role in melanoma tumorigenesis has not yet been established and thus are of particular interest. To do so we implement a novel method to increase the identification of genes that are significantly recurrently mutated in melanoma in the setting of its exceptionally high mutation rate. A preponderance of C>T transitions (85%) in the observed mutational profile reflects a history of DNA damage due to UV radiation, though the majority of somatic mutations in known melanoma genes are not C>T events. Our study broadens understanding of the genomic lesions involved in melanoma tumorigenesis, and we expect our analysis approach to inform future genomic studies of cancer lineages with similarly high mutation rates.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma is the most aggressive and deadliest type of skin cancer due to its high propensity to metastasize. Despite current progress in the identification of promising drugs for treating melanoma, drug resistance has emerged as a serious issue indicating that novel therapeutic strategies may be required. It is well documented that the process of converting the epithelial tumorigenic cell to a mesenchymal phenotype, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), is responsible for conferring an invasive phenotype to cancer cells. An EMT-like process has been shown to occur during melanoma progression. High-mobility-protein AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) is a multi-function transcription factor linked to oncogenesis and EMT in a variety of cancers. HMGA2 is a small DNA-binding protein with three “AT-hook” DNA-binding motifs that specifically recognize the minor groove of AT-rich DNA sequences. HMGA2 is significantly upregulated in human primary melanoma and metastases, including those with BRAF mutations. We accessed the potential application of netropsin, a potent inhibitor of HMGA2-DNA interactions, as an EMT blocking agent of BRAF mutated melanoma cells. Three murine melanoma cells lines that carry mutations in the BRAF gene and show resistance to vemurafenib (D4M, YUMM1.1, and YUMM1.7) were used. Cells were treated with EMT Inducing Media Supplement along with Netropsin and the expression of E-cadherin as well as their migratory behavior were evaluated. Netropsin treatment of EMT induced cells was not cytotoxic, prevented changes in cell morphology, maintained high levels of E-cadherin expression and decreased migratory behavior. All three cell lines express HMGA2 which continues to be expressed in the tumors resulting from subcutaneous injections in mice. YUMM1.1 cells showed the highest levels of expression of HMGA2 amongst the three cell lines. Interestingly, in our preliminary study only YUMM1.1-derived tumors generated overt metastasis in the lung 30 days after the injections. Altogether our data showed that Netropsin is capable of blocking EMT of murine BRAF mutated melanoma cells.

Traditionally, activating RAS mutations have been considered oncogenically equivalent, yet recent studies suggest important clinical distinctions between colon cancers containing K-RAS codon 12 vs. codon 13 mutations. More than 20% of human melanomas harbor N-RAS mutations, the vast majority of which target codon 61, as opposed to N-RAS mutations of codon 12 or 13, which are common in other tumor types. To address this issue, we characterized syngeneic knock-in mouse models conditionally expressing either N-RasG12D or N-RasQ61R under the control of the endogenous locus. In primary melanocyte cultures, activation of either N-Ras allele reduced cellular proliferation even in the presence of concomitant p16INK4a deletion. Correspondingly, melanocyte-specific N-RasG12D expression combined with p16INK4a loss failed to efficiently promote melanoma formation in mice. In contrast, melanocyte-specific N-RasQ61R induction readily combined with p16INK4a loss to promote melanoma formation in vivo with short latency and high penetrance.

We tested depleting Tregs as immunotherapy using anti-CD25 (high-affinity IL-2R subunit) antibodies (αCD25) in ID8agg mouse ovarian cancer (OC). αCD25 reduced ascites and Treg numbers but failed to reduce tumor burden, possibly because it depleted newly activated anti-tumor T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes. Thus, αCD25 could be novel malignant ascites palliation, but has limited stand-alone efficacy. We then tested IL-2/anti-IL-2 complexes (IL-2c) that selectively stimulate medium-affinity (CD122/CD132) IL-2R thought to expand anti-tumor T cells preferentially, but with little Treg effects. In contrast to several single agents we tested that failed to treat ID8agg (e.g., αCD25, αPD-L1, IL-2 fusion toxin denileukin diftitox), IL-2c alone durably reduced ID8agg tumor burden despite lowering the tumor microenvironmental CD8+/Treg ratio. Thus, we hypothesized that IL-2c improved CD8+ function, reduced Treg function, or both. IL-2c increased polyfunctional IFN-γ+TNF-α+ anti-tumor T cells as expected, an effect that persists weeks after drug clearance. IL-2c also increased anti-tumor T cell CD25 expression that increased IL-2 sensitivity and STAT5 phosphorylation, a likely mechanism for increased polyfunctionality. Unexpectedly, IL-2c reduced the Treg functional mediators CD25, TIGIT and granzyme B, and reduced Treg suppressive function. Thus, favorable Treg modifications are a novel IL-2c mechanism of action. Adding αCD25 to IL-2c to deplete Tregs further unexpectedly worsened IL-2c efficacy in ID8agg and reduced effector memory T cells and polyfunctional T cells in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting a previously unappreciated role for CD25 in IL-2c therapy. Similar data were seen in B16 melanoma, suggesting αCD25 reduction of IL-2c efficacy is not tumor or compartment-specific (ID8agg is peritoneal and B16 is subcutaneous). αPD-L1, an ineffective monotherapy in ID8agg, combined with IL-2c to promote complete responses, suggesting potential for potent, novel combinatorial approaches. Our data suggest that antagonizing high affinity IL-2R (such as to deplete Tregs with αCD25) has limited cancer immunotherapy utility without more specific Treg targeting. In contrast, stimulating medium-affinity IL-2R with CD122-selective IL-2c has great translational promise by simultaneously improving beneficial anti-tumor T cells and reducing detrimental Treg function.']",

In addition, we identified two novel, clustered somatic missense mutations (p.Tyr472His and p.Leu481Phe) in RASA1 (RAS p21 protein activator 1, p120RasGAP). In this study, we addressed functional roles of RASA1 in melanoma tumorigenesis. The RNAi-mediated down-regulation of RASA1 promoted, while ectopic expression of wild type RASA1 decreased, anchorage-independent colony formation, tumor growth, and RAS activation. Interestingly, RASA1 Y472H mutant enhanced soft agar colony formation and tumor growth, while RASA1 L481F mutant lost its tumor suppressive activity. Mechanistically, RASA1 required RasGAP activity to suppress colony formation and showed higher activity toward R-Ras (related RAS viral (r-ras) oncogene homolog) isoform among the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. Moreover, RASA1 consistently suppressed Ral-A among Ras downstream effectors. Reduced R-Ras or Ral-A expression via siRNAs suppressed anchorage-independent growth induced by RASA1 loss. Interestingly, RASA1 expression was frequently down-regulated in metastatic melanoma samples (11.4% (4/35) of lymph node metastasis and 3.4% (1/29) of distal metastases) compared to primary melanomas (33.3% (21/63)) and dysplastic nevi (44.1% (15/34)). We also observed significantly shorter overall survival of melanoma patients with BRAF mutations when RASA1 mRNA expression is low, which may be explained by possible cooperative interactions between activation of BRAF/MAPK/ERK and RASA1/R-Ras/Ral-A pathways. Taken together, these data support that RASA1 is a novel melanoma tumor suppressor that is inactivated by suppressed expression or by mutation.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', 'Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer presenting in approximately 50% of cases activating mutations in the BRAF oncogene. For these patients new therapeutic options are represented by the combination of BRAF inhibitors and MEK-inhibitors. However, a major limitation is the occurrence of resistance related in the majority of cases to mutations causing either reactivation of the MAPK/ERK pathway or of the PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway. This complex scenario is worsened by the absence, in a significant proportion of cases, of new mutations. This suggests the involvement also of epigenetic or post-transcriptional changes at the basis of resistance. We have focused our attention over the past years to adaptive changes occurring in melanoma cells upon exposure to BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors in order to identify new therapeutic targets. Here we hypothesize that miRNAs deregulation upon cell exposure to kinase inhibitors may contribute to the development of drug resistance.Experimental procedures', 'The involvement of specific miRNAs in the establishment of drug resistance in melanoma was investigated through the online software miR while target predictions were performed with TargetScan and microrna.org. Impact on melanoma cell growth, migration and establishment of drug resistance was assessed through enforced-transient miR overexpression. Tumor biopsies were obtained from patients before therapy with kinase inhibitors or after relapse and used for RNA extraction.Results', 'We identified by bioinformatics analysis a novel miRNA, miR-579-3p, relevant for BRAF mutated melanoma progression and found that it targets both BRAF, the relevant oncoprotein in these melanomas, and MDM2. miR-579-3p expression levels are high in nevi, heavily decline in stage III-IV melanomas and further decrease in melanomacells selected in vitro for resistance to BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors. Through in vitro studies we obtained evidence that mir-579-3p is able to inhibit melanoma cell growth and migration and to induce apoptosis alone or in combination with BRAF and/or MEKi. Moreover we found that miR-579-3p overexpression impairs the establishment of resistance to BRAFi in human melanoma cells. Finally we found this miR to be down-regulated in tumor samples obtained from patients who developed resistance to target therapies and its expression to be inversely correlated to the expression levels of its target genes, BRAF and MDM2.Conclusions', 'Our results strongly demonstrate that miR-579-3p is a novel oncosuppressor miRNA, controlling melanoma progression and development of drug resistance and which could be used as a new therapeutic target for intervention.']",

        "Background":"['Our pre-clinical in vitro data suggested that all BRAF-mutated cell lines, and some NRAS-mutated melanoma are sensitive to MEK inhibition. BRAFwt/NRASwt were uniformly resistant. Among the sensitive cell lines, those with enhanced activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway did not undergo apoptosis. This is consistent with a recent phase II trial with Selumetinib, an allosteric MEK inhibitor, which showed a 6% response rate in unselected melanoma patients. Retrospectively, 5 of 6 of the responders were found to harbor BRAFV600E mutations. We hypothesized that treatment of BRAF-mutated or NRAS-mutated melanomas with Selumetinib will induce clinical responses only in the subset of tumors in which the PI3K/AKT pathway is not activated. In this phase II trial, melanoma patients with either BRAF or NRAS mutation were stratified based on phospho-AKT (pAKT) expression (high vs. low), as measured by immunohistochemistry staining of pre-treatment tumor specimens. Patients were treated with Selumetinib 75 mg p.o. daily in 28-day cycles. We found that the incidence of high pAKT melanoma tumors was about 4 times higher than low pAKT tumors. None of the 10 patients in the high pAKT cohort responded, although 4 patients showed stable disease for 4 months. This cohort was closed to further accrual. In contrast, in the low pAKT group, 1 patient had a true partial response (PR) and 2 others had near PRs. One of these patients had to discontinue treatment due to toxicity; the other had his remaining tumor resected. This cohort was closed due to slow patient accrual. We used an exon capture, next-generation sequencing assay to define the mutational status of 230 cancer associated genes in pre-treatment tumors, derived from patients belonging to both cohorts. The assay detects point mutations, small indels and copy number alterations. Among the two low pAKT patients who were resistant to MEK inhibition, one had a mutation in MAP2K1 that encodes for a K57N mutation in helix A of MEK1. We speculate that this is an activating mutation, since a missense mutation in the amino acid just proximal (Q56P) was previously shown to be highly activating. The other non-responding patient in the low pAKT cohort had an activating mutation in EGFR. Both of these could drive increased activation of the MAPK pathway, thus explaining the resistance to the drug. We conclude that future trials with MEK inhibitors in melanoma should exclude patients with high pAKT tumors. The occurrence of complex genetic changes in melanoma requires studies to better stratify the patients according the prediction of response to MEK inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma is increasing in incidence by up to 3% annually, and metastatic melanoma, which is resistant to most conventional therapies, has a poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%. Immunotherapy is able to yield durable response in melanoma; however, the response rate is limited (20-30%). It has been shown that tumor immunogenicity is highly correlated to the response to immunotherapy. The mutational load and the characteristics of the neoantigens displayed by the tumor cells are theorized to play an important role in the immunogenicity of the tumor. We used genetically engineered preclinical mouse models to study the role of these neoantigens in melanoma response to immune therapy. Three syngeneic C57BL/6 mouse melanoma models were developed', ' UV induced melanoma in albino BRAF(V600E);PTEN-/- mice (1), DMBA induced melanoma in pigmented HGF-tg;CDK4(R24C) mice (2), and UV induced melanoma in pigmented HGF-tg mice. These three models were found to have varying degrees of tumor immunogenicity based on vaccination studies. The UV induced BRAF(V600E);PTEN-/- model displayed poor immunogenicity, while the DMBA induced HGF-tg;CDK4(R24C) model exhibited moderate immunogenicity and the UV induced HGF-tg model showed the highest immunogenicity. Exome sequencing results showed that high immunogenicity is associated with mutations of genes in DNA damage responses and frameshift mutations. To test the role of neoantigens, RNA from each of the melanoma models was sequenced and analyzed for mutational and expression profiles. We will be comparing the response of these three mouse models to correlate immunogenicity with response to anti-CTLA-4 therapy. We plan to analyze the pathways in which mutated genes were enriched, allowing the identification of druggable targets to enhance therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. CRISPR/Cas9-based screening approaches will be used to identify specific neoantigens able to influence response to immune therapy. In conclusion, our preclinical mouse models show that tumor immunogenicity may be correlated to the carcinogenic mechanisms, and RNA sequence has provided further insight into the role of mutational load and neo-epitopes on immune-based therapeutic response.(1) Provided by Marcus Bosenberg (Yale School of Medicine, New Heaven, CT), Martin McMahon (Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT).(2) Provided by Thomas Tueting (University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany).']",

It has been traditionally characterized by activation of the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, as well as cell cycle disruption. In recent years, whole-genome and exome sequencing studies have identified several new genes associated with melanomagenesis. However, a comprehensive understanding of concurrent, and mutually exclusive, mutations in tumors is currently lacking. Using a custom targeted capture of 108 genes previously implicated in melanoma pathogenesis, massively parallel sequencing was performed on 94 human melanoma cell lines, 67 patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and 5 cell lines made from PDX, all untreated. Samples were then clustered into groups based on deleterious mutations. 83% of samples had deleterious mutations in the MAPK signaling pathway, including 92 high activity BRAF (55%), 35 RAS codon 61 (21%), 7 with multiple mutations (e.g. low activity BRAF/RAS codons 12/13) (4%) and 10 NF1 (6%) mutated samples. Likely deleterious NF1 mutations were found in several BRAF or NRAS-mutated samples. PI3K pathway mutations were found in 10% of samples, predominantly associated with BRAF mutations. TP53 mutations were found in 24% of samples and were associated with all MAPK signaling mutations. Mutations in chromatin remodeling genes (ARID1A/1B, ARID2, TRRAP, and BAP1) were mutually exclusive with each other and primarily found in tumors with high activity BRAF or NRAS mutations. The majority of BRAF or RAS-mutated samples with a mutation in a chromatin remodeling gene lacked mutations in cell cycle, TP53, and PI3K signaling genes; however, 100% of deleterious, or likely deleterious, NF1-mutated samples with a chromatin remodeling gene mutation harbored additional mutations in cell cycle, TP53, and/or PI3K signaling genes. Of particular interest, five of the 10 NF1-mutated samples (50%) lacked BRAF, RAS, and MEK1/2 mutations but harbored likely deleterious mutations in MAP3K5 or MAP3K9, suggesting the potential involvement of the JNK signal transduction pathway in this particular cohort. Only 4% of samples did not have a deleterious mutation in any of the genes on the panel. These data reveal novel insights into the genetics of melanomas lacking a canonical BRAF V600 mutation. Functional assays are needed to confirm the biological relevance of likely deleterious mutations, which will further facilitate a more thorough classification of CM subsets.']",

A large number of somatic alterations were discovered in these tumors and hybridization capture-based validation confirmed 17,361 tier 1 point mutations, 84 tier 1 indels, and 411 somatic structural variants. As a pilot study to exploit this genomic data in order to identify novel genetic alterations driving melanoma tumorigenesis, we performed mutation proximity analysis to select candidates for further analysis. In this study, we addressed possible roles of DBC1 (Deleted in Bladder Cancer 1) and RASA1 (RAS p21 protein activator 1), which showed previously undocumented neighboring mutations. RASA1 is a GTPase activation protein that acts as a suppressor of RAS function. RASA1 has been implicated in actin filament polymerization, vascular development, cellular apoptosis, and cell motility. Our whole-genome analyses of melanomas identified two somatic missense mutations, targeting highly conserved neighboring Y472 and L481 in or around the PH domain in RASA1 in two samples. DBC1, also called BRINP, DBCCR1, and FAM5A, was previously shown to undergo loss of heterozygosity at 9q32-q33 in bladder cancer, and methylation silencing in bladder, breast, and lung cancers. Ectopic expression of DBC1 in bladder and lung cancer cells was reported to cause cell death and to inhibit cell proliferation, respectively. We observed six DBC1 missense mutations by whole genome analyses in four patients, including 2 neighboring mutations targeting S688 and S690. The shRNA-mediated knock down of DBC1 and RASA1 in melanocyte derived from Ink4a/Arf deletion/BRAF mutation background promoted proliferation, soft agar colony formation, and invasion. Ectopic expression of wild type DBC1 and RASA1 in human melanoma cell lines SKmel28 and WM983C (all with BRAFV600E), respectively, decreased soft agar colony formation, supporting their tumor suppressive roles. Various mutant forms of RASA1 and DBC1 were addressed for their roles. Interestingly, loss of RASA1 conferred decreased sensitivity to BRAF inhibitor Vemurafenib. In order to address the mutation frequency of DBC1 and RASA1, we analyzed additional melanoma samples and observed mutation rates of 21% for DBC1 (20/96 patients) and 9% for RASA1 (20/221).

        "Background":"['Background', ' Historically, patients with metastatic melanoma had an extremely poor prognosis with a median overall survival (OS) of 6 to 9 months. In 2010, the CTLA4 blocking antibody ipilimumab, showed for the first time, an improvement in median OS and was approved for this stage of disease. Yet, only around 20% of the treated patients benefit long-term. In addition, ipilimumab can cause serious, sometimes life-threatening side-effects and puts a high burden on health costs. Adoptive transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is another promising new treatment modality for patients with metastatic melanoma. Several independent phase II studies have shown comparable and consistent response rates of around 50%, with very durable responses in patients reaching a complete remission. TIL therapy consists of infusion of high numbers of ex vivo expanded TIL preceded by non-myeloablative (NMA) chemotherapy and followed by high dose interleukin-2 (HD IL-2). Methods', ' This is an international, open-label, multi-center, phase III study. Patients with irresectable stage IIIc or IV melanoma, between the ages of 18 and 70 years, with one or more resectable metastases summing up to at least 2-3 cm in diameter and adequate organ function, are randomized 1', '1 between TIL therapy and ipilimumab. Patients will be stratified according to BRAF V600 mutation status, line of treatment (1st or 2nd line) and treatment center. Patients randomized to TIL will receive NMA chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day for 2 days i.v.) and fludarabine (50 mg/m2 for 5 days i.v.), intravenous adoptive transfer of > 5x109 TIL followed by HD IL-2 (600.000 IU/kg/dose every 8 hours, maximally 15 doses). Patients randomized to ipilimumab (3 mg/kg i.v.) will receive this once every three weeks, for up to 4 doses. The primary end-point is progression free survival at six months. Secondary endpoints are OS, complete response rate, ORR and safety profile. Enrollment began in September 2014. 168 randomized patients are required to show a 50% increase in PFS at 6 months.

Analysis of malignant transformation of melanocytes and melanoma progression frequently utilizes immortalized melanoma cell lines that propagated in the laboratory. We studied the diversity of genetic mutations in the MAPK pathway in established melanoma cell lines and compared it to that of human melanoma tissue samples. Methods', ' We screened 30 well-established human melanoma cell lines, the majority of which were derived from melanoma metastases at dermal or nodal locations, for 85 mutations found within the AKT1, BRAF, KIT, KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA and PTEN genes by RT-PCR. We then interrogated 263 melanoma genomes available in the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) skin cutaneous melanoma dataset for the presence and frequency of these mutations. Mutational frequencies were determined by sorting the data in MS Excel. Results', ' BRAF was mutated in 39% of TCGA melanoma genomes and 53% of cell line genomes. NRAS genes were mutated in 26% of TCGA samples and 13% of cell lines. Cell lines were 34 times more likely to bear a KIT mutation than TCGA samples. Mutations in each of the 8 tested genes except PTEN were found in TCGA genome samples, while cell lines contained mutations in BRAF, KIT, NRAS, PTEN, and lacked any of the tested mutations in AKT1, KRAS, HRAS, PIK3CA. Cell lines exhibited a higher frequency of unique mutational combinations. Both BRAF and KIT were mutated in 13% of cell lines, and each of NRAS and KIT; NRAS and PTEN; and NRAS, BRAF and PTEN in 3.3% of cell lines; all these combinations were absent in TCGA melanoma genomes. Mutations in PIK3CA combined with either BRAF or NRAS were found in 1% of TCGA samples but absent from cell lines. Conclusions', ' These data indicate that mutational status and frequency of individual mutations and mutation combinations found in melanoma cell lines can diverge from that observed in clinical tissue specimens. Additional changes observed in cell lines may provide insight into evolutionary mutations in progressive melanoma. Understanding of genetic profiles of cell lines may provide additional information in their sensitivity to pathway inhibitors.']",

Activation of the MAPK pathway due to mutations in BRAF and NRAS is considered one of the causes of melanoma.HM95573 is a novel, highly potent RAF kinase inhibitor. Biochemically assayed for over 120 kinases, HM95573 showed the high selectivity toward BRAF mutant and CRAF kinases. The half maximal inhibition concentrations (IC50) of HM95573 against BRAFWT, BRAFV600E and CRAF kinases were 41nM, 7nM and 2nM, respectively. The strongly inhibited kinases subsequent to RAF kinases appeared to be CSF1R (44nM), DDR1 (77nM) and DDR2 (182 nM).HM95573 potently inhibited the growth of mutant BRAF melanoma cell lines such asA375 (IC50', ' 57nM) and SK-MEL-28 (69nM) and of mutant NRAS melanoma cell lines such asSK-MEL-2 (53nM) and SK-MEL-30 (24nM). In addition, the phosphorylations of MEK and ERK downstream kinases associated with cell proliferation were effectively inhibited with treatment of HM95573in mutant BRAF and mutant NRAS melanoma cells.HM95573inhibited the downstream signaling in melanoma cells even in the presence of HGF which is known to mediate innate resistance to RAF inhibitors.HM95573 showed the excellent antitumor activity in mouse models xenografted with both of BRAF mutation cell lines (e.g. A375 and SK-MEL-28) and NRAS mutation cell lines (such as SK-MEL-2 and SK-MEL-30) compared to two RAF inhibitors approved in melanoma which were effective to only BRAF mutation cell lines under conditions tested. Furthermore, HM95573 did not show a potential to paradoxical activation inducing tumor growth in mouse xenograft study using A431 cuSCC (cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma)cancer cell.Now, HM95573 is currently in phase I development in patients with advanced solid tumors including melanoma in Korea.']",

        "Background":"['Metastatic melanoma is the major cause of skin cancer death, and the annual incidence of melanoma continues to increase. Despite the impressively high rates of response to BRAF inhibitors in patients with melanomas harboring BRAF mutations, most of these patients eventually relapse after developing resistance to the drug, due in part to secondary mutations in NRAS. Although NRAS mutation is the second most common genetic mutation in melanoma patients (after BRAF mutation), there is currently no treatment option that targets NRAS-mutated melanomas. New targeted therapies are urgently needed. Our previous reports have demonstrated the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cell lines carrying oncogenic KRAS mutations to apoptosis initiated by inhibition of protein kinase C delta (PKCd), suggesting that PKCd inhibitors might be effective in melanomas with primary or acquired NRAS mutations. PKCd is not required for normal mammalian development, making it a potential tumor-specific target. In this study, we investigated the effect of PKCd inhibition, and the efficacy of a new PKCd inhibitor BJE6-106 (B106), in melanoma. Inhibition of PKCd by B106 (at nano-molar concentrations), or by siRNA, inhibited the growth of multiple melanoma cell lines carrying NRAS mutations, and induced apoptosis mediated by terminal caspase activation. Analysis of the molecular mechanisms involved in this NRAS signaling-targeted approach demonstrated activation of the JNK pathway after PKCd inhibition, leading to the activation (phosphorylation) of H2AX, a histone H2A variant. Activation of H2AX was attenuated when JNK1/2 levels were repressed, indicating that H2AX activation is mediated by the JNK pathway in response to PKCd inhibition. Although the phosphorylation of H2AX has in the past been primarily known for its role in repair of DNA double strand breakage, more recent studies have proposed an active role for phospho-H2AX in the induction of apoptosis. Consistent with these reports, knockdown of H2AX prior to inhibition of PKCd mitigated the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis in NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines. To explore the potential activity of new PKCd inhibitors in inhibitor-resistant BRAF-mutant tumors, we derived melanoma cell lines harboring BRAF mutations that evolved resistance to a BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 (vemurafenib). B106 effectively induced cytotoxicity in these cells, suggesting the potential clinical application of targeting PKCd in patients who have relapsed following treatment with PLX4032. Taken together, our present study suggests that inhibition of PKCd causes caspase-dependent apoptosis in melanomas with NRAS mutations and in PLX4032-resistant BRAF mutant melanomas. This apoptosis is mediated via activation of the JNK-H2AX pathway, which involves a novel role for phospho-H2AX in the execution of apoptosis.']",

The influence of sunlight UV-exposure on the etiology of uveal melanoma is matter of debate. The recent identification of driver mutations in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene with UV induced cytidine-to-thymidine transitions in cutaneous melanoma prompted us to investigate whether these mutations also occur in uveal melanoma. We also analyzed the frequency of other recently discovered uveal melanoma specific mutations in the genes GNAQ, GNA11, BAP1, SF3B1, and EIFAX1, and we analyzed the association of these mutation with histopathological and clinical features including progression free survival. Finally, we analyzed TERT expression in these tumors.The mutation frequencies observed confirmed the prevalence of GNAQ mutations in cases with disomy of chromosome 3 that have a better prognosis whereas GNA11 was more frequent in monosomic cases. Together these two mutations account for more than 85% of the cases. BAP1 mutations are associated with chromosome 3 monosomy but not with progression free survival. SF3B1 and EIF1AX mutations occur in 10.3 and 22.5% of uveal melanomas, in disomic cases only. We detected a TERT mutation in only one case of a 57-year old white male with clinical and histo-pathological features typical for uveal melanoma. The tumor showed mutations in GNA11 and EIF1AX. No mutations were detected in GNAQ, BAP1, and SF3B1. Both copies of chromosome 3 were retained. Several tumors among which the one carrying the TERT promoter mutation showed elevated TERT expression.These data indicate that TERT mutations are rare in uveal melanoma, consistent with a reduced etiological influence of sunlight.

However, there are many cancer treatments for which there are few tools for individualized selection based on patient-specific attributes. This is especially the case for the immune check point inhibitors, where a subset of patients receive almost unimaginable benefit, there is a significant incidence of severe, life threatening, and persistent autoimmune oriented toxicities, and the financial burden is real for patients. At least 3 distinct predictive immunooncology biomarkers (IOMark) have been proposed. This includes tumor mutation analysis, expression of PD-L1, and tumor-specific t cell subset (Weber Predictor). However, there is little data on the intrapatient relationship of these putative response markers. Methods', ' Analysis of individual patient IOMark status was determined in TCGA patients that had cancers for which immunotherapy is FDA approved (n = 2039; bladder, colorectal, kidney, lung, melanoma, stomach). Patients were categorized as putative high/low predicted responders for each biomarker [neoantigen burden (whole exome cutpoint = 225), PD-L1 (median), Weber predictor (upper 50% for each of CD8/Ki67/EOMES)]. Results', ' A high neoantigen burden was detected in 1%-60% of the tumors (median 31%; range kidney to melanoma). There was less variance for high PD-L1 (26%-78%, median 49%; colorectal to lung).
