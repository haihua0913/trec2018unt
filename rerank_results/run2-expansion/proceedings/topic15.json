Here we show that mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cooperate with BRAF mutations in melanomagenesis by preventing OIS. In a genetically engineered mouse model, Nf1 mutations suppress Braf-induced senescence, promote melanocyte hyperproliferation, and enhance melanoma development. Nf1 mutations function by deregulating both PI3K and ERK pathways. As such, Nf1/Braf mutant tumors are resistant to BRAF inhibitors but are sensitive to combined MEK/mTOR inhibition. Importantly, NF1 is mutated or suppressed in human melanomas that harbor concurrent BRAF mutations, NF1 ablation decreases the sensitivity of melanoma cell lines to BRAF inhibitors, and NF1 is lost in tumors from patients following treatment with these agents. Collectively, these studies provide mechanistic insight into how NF1 cooperates with BRAF mutations in melanoma and demonstrate that NF1-inactivation may impact responses to targeted therapies.']",

        "Background":"['Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic syndrome caused by a mutation in or deletion of the NF1 gene. Mutations in the NF1 gene lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of neurofibromin that cannot regulate cell growth and division. As a result, tumors such as neurofibromas can form along nerves throughout the body. The NF1 phenotype is highly penetrant and occurs in 1 in 3,000 to 4,000 people worldwide. Individuals with an altered NF1 gene are at an increased risk of developing benign and/or malignant tumors.  NF1 has been shown to negatively regulate Ras activity. Ras-driven cancer cells have also been known to alter glucose and glutamine metabolism. In the present study, we evaluated the role played by NF1 status in determining the sensitivity of sarcoma and melanoma cell lines to glutaminase inhibition and its effect on Ras activity. We tested a panel of soft tissue sarcoma and melanoma cell lines that were either wild-type, null or mutant for NF1. Results from our in vitro proliferation assay showed that compared to wild-type NF1 (STS26T, LS141) cell lines, NF1 mutant (MPNST) and NF1 null (ST88 and MeWo) cell lines showed greater sensitivity to inhibition of proliferation by glutaminase inhibitors CB-839 and BPTES. Western blot analysis showed induction of apoptosis and down regulation of mTORC1 targets such as phospho-S6K and phospho-S6 by glutaminase inhibitors only in NF1 null and NF1 mutant but not wild-type NF1 cell lines. Gene silencing experiments showed that siRNA mediated knockdown of NF1 sensitizes LS141and STS26T cell lines to glutaminase inhibition. Conversely, overexpression of wild-type NF1 GRD (GAP related domain) in MeWo cell line resulted in decreased sensitivity to glutaminase inhibition when tested in a cell proliferation assay, thus, confirming the role played by NF1. Previous reports have shown that mutation or deletion of NF1 results in activation of Ras. In order to test the effect of glutaminase inhibition on Ras activity, we carried out Ras-GTP pull down assay following the treatment with glutaminase inhibitors in NF1 null and wild-type NF1 cell lines. Our results showed that glutaminase inhibition leads to down regulation of activated RAS in NF1 null but not wild-type NF1 cells. SiRNA mediated knockdown of NF1 followed by glutaminase inhibition in wild-type NF1 cell line (LS141) resulted in decreased Ras activity, further confirming our hypothesis. Results from patient derived MPNST tumor xenograft model showed a significant suppression of tumor volume when tumors were treated with glutaminase inhibitor compared to vehicle control. Taken together, our data strongly indicates that NF1 status determines the sensitivity of sarcoma and melanoma cell lines to glutaminase inhibition. Further research is warranted to explore glutaminase inhibition as potential therapy for patients with NF1 loss and/or mutation.']",

Biallelic inactivation of the NF1 gene increases risk of developing brain tumors, leukemia, neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Somatic mutations in the NF1 gene are also associated with sporadic malignancies including glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, and melanoma. The NF1 tumor suppressor gene encodes the RAS GTPase-activating protein (GAP) neurofibromin. Loss of NF1 results hyperactivation of Ras, MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways components, representing potential therapeutic targets. However, the variable response of NF1 mutant tumors to MAPK and mTOR inhibitors suggests the intrinsic heterogeneity of NF1 mutant tumors. We hypothesized that defining alternative mechanisms and functional sub-classes of Nf1-mutant tumors on the basis of their variable drug sensitivity will produce pre-clinical therapeutics data that will inform clinical trials.']",

        "Background":"['Spred proteins negatively regulate Ras/MAPK signaling following growth factor stimulation. Inhibition of Ras primary occurs through Spreds ability to bind and localize NF1, a RasGAP and major tumor suppressor, to the plasma membrane. Spred1 and NF1 loss-of-function mutations occur across multiple cancer types including non-small cell lung carcinoma, glioblastoma, melanoma, stomach carcinoma, and uterine carcinosarcoma. Here we demonstrate that EGFR signaling disrupts Spred1-NF1 binding. Mass spectrometry was performed on cells overexpressing EGFRL858R to identify potential phosphorylation sites on Spred1 and NF1 that could disrupt Spred1-NF1 binding by steric hindrance. A serine phosphorylation site on Spred1 was identified in which a phosphomimetic and phosphodeficient mutant decreased or increased Spred1-NF1 binding, respectively. Phosphomimetic Spred1 is unable to suppress Ras-GTP following EGF stimulation. Therefore, phosphorylation of Spred1 at this site by a serine kinase downstream of EGFR may disrupt Spred1-NF1 binding. To identify the Spred1 kinase we are performing an in vitro kinase assay and an unbiased CRISPRa screen. Our findings provide one potential mechanism by which EGFR signaling disrupts negative feedback to sustain constitutive Ras signaling. Furthermore, this work may elucidate a novel therapeutic target for restoring NF1-mediated inhibition of Ras.']",

        "Background":"['Somatic strongly activating KRAS mutations play an oncogenic role across numerous human cancers, while less activating germline KRAS mutations are associated with developmental disorders. KRAS encodes two splice variant products—KRAS-4A and KRAS-4B—differing in their C-terminus through alternative fourth coding exons. Though KRAS-4A is homologous to the original transforming transcript identified in Kirsten rat sarcoma virus, its role in human cancer is less characterized compared to KRAS-4B. Here, through genetic analyses of three cohorts of patients with hereditary and/or aggressive cancers, we identified a rare KRAS-4A specific C-terminal truncating germline mutation (KRAS-4A C180X; rs373169526) in affected men of three families with hereditary prostate cancer and a patient with hereditary melanoma (minor allele frequency [MAF] of 0.0014 in these combined cancer cohorts assessed vs. 0.000056 in the ExAC population database, odds ratio 24.6 [95% confidence interval 5.1-103.5], two sided Fisher’s exact test p = 9.0E-5). The KRAS-4A C180X mutation truncates the C-terminus, removing the polybasic region and -CAAX motifs previously demonstrated to be necessary for Ras family member membrane association, MAP kinase signaling activation and transformation, suggesting a loss of function phenotype. However, in silico assessment of reported human variation demonstrates truncating germline variants only in KRAS-4A and not KRAS-4B, consistent with tolerance. Expression of KRAS-4A protein in NIH3T3 and MDCK leads to loss of exclusive membrane association and inhibits GTP loading, as expected, but paradoxically resulted in modest but significantly increased proliferation and soft agar colony growth compared to control or wildtype KRAS expressing cells. Pro-oncogenic phenotypes were not dependent on MAPK signaling, but showed sensitivity to AKT inhibition. In summary, we identified a germline truncating KRAS-4A mutation over-represented in hereditary cancers that defines a novel mechanism of KRAS activation not dependent on the C-terminal polybasic and -CAAX motifs.']",

        "Background":"['EIF1AX (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A) is a component of the translation pre-initiation complex (PIC). Recurrent EIF1AX mutations, first reported in uveal melanomas, are found in 1% of papillary thyroid cancers in a mutually exclusive manner with other oncogenic driver events (BRAF, RAS, and oncogenic fusions). By contrast, they are enriched in advanced thyroid cancers (9% of anaplastic and 11% poorly-differentiated thyroid cancers), and are strongly associated with RAS mutations (p<0.0001). EIF1AX mutations cluster in the N-terminal (NTT) or C-terminal tails (CTT). EIF1AX NTT missense mutations in thyroid cancer occur within the first 15 amino acids, whereas the CTT mutation disrupts a splice acceptor site at exon 6 (A113splice). A113splice is the most prevalent defect and is private to this disease, and results in two differentially spliced mRNAs', ' (1) Cryptic splice variant', ' by use of a cryptic acceptor site in exon 6 that leads to a 132 AA protein that excludes 12 AA; (2) Truncated splice variant', ' by retaining intron 5, leading to a 115 AA truncated protein. EIF1AX mutants retain the ability to recruit the ternary complex, as shown by co-IP with EIF2 after ectopic expression of NTT or A113splice EIF1AX mutants in HEK293T cells, or after CRISPR-mediated knock-in of A113splice into Cal62 RAS-mutant thyroid cancer cells. The EIF1AX mutants had greater affinity to EIF5 compared to WT, consistent with a more stable PIC. As translation initiation is a rate-limiting step, the altered affinity of EIF1AX mutants to PIC components could impact the rate of protein synthesis. We tested this by L-azidohomoalanine labeling, which showed contrasting roles of the two A113-generated splice variants expressed at endogenous levels', ' i.e. the cryptic splice variant increased protein synthetic rate, whereas the truncated splice variant strongly inhibited protein translation. Despite inhibiting translation, the truncated splice variant showed a paradoxical increase in 4EBP1 phosphorylation. Upon A113splice knock-in, where both variants are expressed, translation is increased, which we hypothesize results from the combined effects of 4EBP1 phosphorylation, caused by relief of negative feedback events upstream in the pathway, with increased PIC assembly caused by the cryptic splice variant. We are currently determining whether the altered rate of protein synthesis is global or selective. Of note, cells expressing the cryptic, but not the truncated splice form, showed a transforming phenotype as assessed by soft agar colony formation. As EIF1AX mutations co-occur with RAS mutations in advanced thyroid cancers, it is likely that RAS-induced PI3K-AKT/mTOR signaling may provide a further cooperative benefit and play a key role in disease progression, and in generating specific tumor cell dependencies.']",

        "Background":"['Prevention of cutaneous malignant melanoma requires the identification and clearance of abnormal, pre-cancerous cells by the immune system. Central to this immune surveillance is the interplay between KIR receptors present on natural killer cells and their HLA ligands expressed on target cells. Like HLA, the KIR genes are highly polymorphic. They encode both activating receptors (that trigger NK-cell mediated killing), and inhibitory receptors (important in NK cell education and self-tolerance). Many of the KIR genes occur as copy number variants, and we hypothesize that inter- individual variability in KIR copy number is associated with melanoma risk. A random sample of cases and controls within the large, population-based Minnesota Skin Health Study were selected for examination (84 cases and 87 controls). Using Luminex technology and genomic DNA isolated from subject buccal cells we tested for the presence or absence of specific KIR genes (KIR3DL1, KIR2DS1, KIR2DL2, KIR2DL3, KIR2DL5, KIR2DS1, KIR2DS2, KIR2DS3, KIR2DS4 {truncating allele}, KIR2DS5, KIR2DS1). In addition to investigating each gene as a melanoma risk factor, we created an integrated locus score for 2DL2/DL3 and 3DL1/DS1, reflecting the typical mutual exclusivity of these genes at their respective loci. Results', ' Homozygous deletion of the activating KIR gene 2DS1 was associated with both an increasing number of nevi (p<0.04), and increased melanoma risk (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2 - 4.3). Similarly, at the shared 3DL1/3DS1 locus, absence of the activating KIR3DS1 gene was significantly associated with increased melanoma risk (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0 - 3.3), and a borderline significant increase in the number of nevi (p<0.07). In contrast, at the KIR2DL2/2DL3 locus, which encodes two inhibitory KIR alleles, our data suggest that a lack of diversity at this locus may be more important than the presence or absence of either gene; individuals homozygous for either 2DL2 or 2DL3 were at increased risk for both nevi (p<0.03), and melanoma (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0 - 3.4) relative to those who had both 2DL2 and 2DL3.

Presently, we have an ongoing trial utilizing T cell receptor (TCR)-modified cells reactive to the melanoma antigen, tyrosinase, for treatment of metastatic melanoma (NCT01586403). Current protocols using viral vectors to generate cells for adoptive transfer require activation in the presence of IL-2. While IL-2 stimulates proliferation and production of mature effector cells, it also induces T cell exhaustion. We hypothesize that tyrosinase-reactive TCR-modified cells generated in the absence of activation have an increased potential for expansion, persistence, and anti-melanoma activity. In these studies, we investigate whether IL-7, a homeostatic regulator, facilitates the transfer of a tyrosinase-reactive TCR to lymphocytes without activation. Methods', ' Gene-modified cells were generated using a lentiviral vector including alpha and beta chains of a TCR reactive to tyrosinase and a truncated CD34 molecule as a transduction marker. Peripheral lymphocytes from normal human donors were transduced with lentivirus following no treatment, treatment with IL-7, or activation in the presence of IL-2. Transduced CD34 positive cells were isolated using magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) and injected intravenously into NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice. Results', ' We found that IL-7 treatment improved transduction in non-activated cells and resulted in expression levels of CD34 and TCR variable beta chain 12 (vbeta12) comparable to cells activated in the presence of IL-2. When non-activated tyrosinase-reactive TCR-modified human T cells were adoptively transferred into NOD NSG mice, the cells were detectable in the peripheral blood of mice up to 7 days after transfer. Conclusions', ' These findings suggest that generating melanoma antigen TCR-modified cells in the absence of activation for adoptive transfer is feasible with IL-7 treatment. Ongoing studies in NSG mice transplanted with melanoma will help determine whether non-activated gene-modified cells will improve the efficacy and longevity of cell therapy for melanoma and other malignancies.']",

Reported resistance mechanisms include acquisition of NRAS mutations, PDGFR or IGF1R activation, Cot amplification, or truncated BRAF upregulation. We report here that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), neuregulin-1 (NRG1), and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) cause robust resistance in vitro to BRAF or MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines. NRAS mutant lines were similarly resistant to MEK inhibition in the presence of these growth factors. By contrast other mitogenic factors such as PDGF, EGF, NGF, BDNF, MSP, MDK, GRO, and IGF1 did not maintain cell viability or growth. HGF, NRG1 and FGF2 prevented growth arrest and cell death and in some cell lines maintained cells in progressive growth. In addition, HGF and NRG1 could prevent growth arrest after dual treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Western analysis revealed that HGF and NRG1 reactivated Erk signaling and activated S6RP and AKT phosphorylation. Combined pharmacological inhibition mTor signaling and Akt signaling was required to fully block growth factor-mediated proliferation. In addition, small molecule Met inhibitors and an anti-HGF antibody blocked HGF-mediated resistance, while lapatinib and an anti-NRG1 antibody blocked NRG1-mediated resistance. While combined Akt and mTor inhibition potently inhibited cell line growth independent of BRAF or MEK inhibition, lapatinib and Met inhibitors had minimal effect on growth, suggesting potential for less adverse events with receptor inhibitors. In vitro co-culture experiments revealed that primary cells present in normal skin can cause resistance, and we have identified growth factors produced by these cells that contribute to resistance. We are analyzing receptor activation (Met and Erbb3) and FGF2 expression in wildtype, NRAS, and BRAF mutant primary melanoma samples.

The recent work of The Cancer Genome Atlas Network has defined melanoma as an RTK/RAS-driven solid tumor that can be classified into four genomic subtypes', ' BRAF-mutant, RAS-mutant, NF1-mutant, and triple-wild-type.

The resultant compound mutant zebrafish develop aggressive melanomas from the age of 7 weeks and the tumor penetrance is 80% by the age of 18 weeks. We demonstrate further that these high-risk zebrafish melanomas were exclusive of hotspot mutations of braf and nras. Sustained inhibition of both MEK and PI3K suppressed tumor progression in vivo, whereas inhibition of MEK or PI3K alone was insufficient to suppress the growth of these tumors. Surprisingly, single agent therapy with rapamycin, an MTOR inhibitor, proved even better for short- and long-term suppression of tumor cell growth in nf1/pten-mutant melanomas.

The frame shift deletion is predicted to truncate the BAP1 protein, and immunohistochemistry analysis of tumor specimens revealed predominant cytoplasmic staining. We genotyped 650K SNPs of the four MM samples and four controls and carried out principal component analysis and whole-genome identity-by-descent analysis using publicly available genotype data from the 1000 Genomes Project, UK10K Project, and NHIBL Exome Sequencing Project. These analyses showed that the four MM patients are of Central Europe ancestry and that some are related by a kinship coefficient of 0.0186. Haplotype analysis showed the presence of significantly shared segments around the BAP1 gene (LOD>37.1). The pairwise extent of shared segments between any of the four MM patients ranged in length from 9.1 to 34.2 Mbp and indicates the c.1832delC variant originated in a recent common ancestor within five to ten generations.

This is particularly true for the understudied dark matter of the melanoma genome, i.e. cases that lack mutations in the three most commonly-mutated melanoma genes (BRAF, NRAS, NF1) and that display extensive mutational heterogeneity. Clearly a pressing need exists for transformative approaches to melanoma medicine. We have therefore broadened our traditional focus on melanoma in human patients to include canine melanoma as a model of human disease. Given canine melanoma's clinicopathological resemblance to human non-cutaneous triple-negative subtypes, study of this disease in each species may inform the other. Further, the accelerated clinical course of canine melanoma and flexibility in veterinary clinical trial design may allow for evaluation of novel treatment designs that would not be possible in human cancer trials. Thus, we have undertaken a first-in-dog genomic characterization study of canine melanomas from a cohort of 37 dogs to further explore the landscape of this comparative model. This analysis combines comprehensive genomics (whole genome, whole genome long-insert, RNA sequencing, and array comparative genomic hybridization) in 7 matched canine melanoma/normal tissues with targeted analysis in an additional 27 tumors and 3 cell lines. These canine tumors display striking patterns of mutation and subtype heterogeneity resembling that of their non-cutaneous human counterparts with the majority being BRAF, NRAS, and NF1 wild type and lacking recurrent single nucleotide variants. Despite heterogeneity at the single nucleotide level, shared patterns of structural variation and gene expression exist and these patterns suggest core pathways that may define therapeutic vulnerabilities in these disease subtypes. These data provide the genomic framework for further clinical pursuit of melanoma in the canine model as a paradigm for drug development.\"]",

        "Background":"['Desmoplastic melanomas (DMs) comprise 4% of the overall melanoma burden and have a 5-year survival rate of 85%. DMs are dermal tumors characterized by spindled melanocytes situated within abundant desomplastic stroma. These unusual histological features commonly lead to misdiagnosis. Currently, there are no known genetic drivers. A better understanding of the underlying biology of desmoplastic melanoma would provide biomarkers and therapeutic opportunities. Towards this goal, we performed low-coverage genome and high-coverage exome sequencing of 20 DMs in a discovery cohort, followed by targeted sequencing of 293 candidate genes on a validation cohort of 42 cases. Additionally, high-resolution aCGH was performed on samples from both cohorts. A high mutation burden (median 62 mutations/Mb) ranked desmoplastic melanoma among the most highly mutated cancers sequenced to date. Mutation patterns strongly indicate that UV-radiation is the dominant mutagen and implicate a superficially located cell of origin despite their predominantly intradermal presentation. Novel alterations included recurrent promoter mutations and amplification of NF-kappa B inhibitor epsilon, NFKBIE (IkB) in 14.5% of samples. The promoter mutations typically affect both alleles and occur over a highly conserved DNA region. The mutations are predicted to disrupt a canonical Ets Like Factor 1 (ELF1) binding site. In total, these data imply aberrant NF-kappa B signaling as a pathogenic feature of desmoplastic melanoma. Commonly mutated oncogenes in melanomas, in particular BRAF V600E and NRAS Q61K/R, were absent. Instead, other genetic alterations known to activate the MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades were identified in 73% of samples, affecting NF1, CBL, ERBB2, MAP2K1, MAP3K1, BRAF, EGFR, PTPN11, MET, RAC1, SOS2, NRAS, and PIK3CA. Rb and p53 pathway alterations occurred respectively in 71% and 66% of tumors, affecting RB1, FBXW7, CDK4, PPP6C, CCND1, CDKN2A, TP53, and MDM2. Finally, TERT promoter mutations or amplifications occurred in 90% of tumors. The consequences of the mutations on protein expression levels was confirmed by immunostaining for NF1, EGFR, Rb, CDK4, CCND1, p16, p53, and Mdm2. Collectively, many of these oncogenic mutations are potentially druggable. In conclusion, desmoplastic melanomas harbor distinct genetic alterations that explain their unique biology, and this study illuminates genetic biomarkers and nominates targets for therapeutic intervention.']",

In addition, NF1 (neurofibromatosis type 1), one of the Ras GTPase activating proteins (RasGAPs), has been shown to be mutated or suppressed in melanoma. However, importance of other RasGAPs has not been addressed in melanoma.To obtain a comprehensive view of melanoma genomes, we conducted whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 15 metastatic melanomas and matched normal PBMC genomes from 13 melanoma patients. All melanoma genomes from these 13 patients contained at least one mutation in genes of Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway (MAPK1, MAP3K1, MAP4K2, MAP3K14, NRAS, and BRAF).

In this study, we addressed possible roles of RASA1 in melanoma tumorigenesis. To determine RASA1 level in melanocytic lesions, immunohistochemical analysis of RASA1 on human melanoma tissue microarray (TMA) containing nevi (n=34), primary melanomas (n=63), lymph node metastasis (n=35), and distal metastasis (n=29) was performed. This analysis has shown the inverse correlation of RASA1 expression to melanoma progression. Functionally, ectopic expression of RASA1 mutant increased soft-agar colony formation and tumor growth while that of wild-type RASA1 decreased. shRNA-mediated knock down of RASA1 promoted soft-agar colony formation and invasion of melanocytes and melanoma cells with BRAF mutation as a consequence of the elevated Ras activity.Here, we established the functional significance of novel somatic missense mutations in RASA1 identified in our WGS study.

It has been traditionally characterized by activation of the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, as well as cell cycle disruption. In recent years, whole-genome and exome sequencing studies have identified several new genes associated with melanomagenesis. However, a comprehensive understanding of concurrent, and mutually exclusive, mutations in tumors is currently lacking. Using a custom targeted capture of 108 genes previously implicated in melanoma pathogenesis, massively parallel sequencing was performed on 94 human melanoma cell lines, 67 patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and 5 cell lines made from PDX, all untreated. Samples were then clustered into groups based on deleterious mutations. 83% of samples had deleterious mutations in the MAPK signaling pathway, including 92 high activity BRAF (55%), 35 RAS codon 61 (21%), 7 with multiple mutations (e.g. low activity BRAF/RAS codons 12/13) (4%) and 10 NF1 (6%) mutated samples. Likely deleterious NF1 mutations were found in several BRAF or NRAS-mutated samples. PI3K pathway mutations were found in 10% of samples, predominantly associated with BRAF mutations. TP53 mutations were found in 24% of samples and were associated with all MAPK signaling mutations. Mutations in chromatin remodeling genes (ARID1A/1B, ARID2, TRRAP, and BAP1) were mutually exclusive with each other and primarily found in tumors with high activity BRAF or NRAS mutations. The majority of BRAF or RAS-mutated samples with a mutation in a chromatin remodeling gene lacked mutations in cell cycle, TP53, and PI3K signaling genes; however, 100% of deleterious, or likely deleterious, NF1-mutated samples with a chromatin remodeling gene mutation harbored additional mutations in cell cycle, TP53, and/or PI3K signaling genes. Of particular interest, five of the 10 NF1-mutated samples (50%) lacked BRAF, RAS, and MEK1/2 mutations but harbored likely deleterious mutations in MAP3K5 or MAP3K9, suggesting the potential involvement of the JNK signal transduction pathway in this particular cohort. Only 4% of samples did not have a deleterious mutation in any of the genes on the panel. These data reveal novel insights into the genetics of melanomas lacking a canonical BRAF V600 mutation. Functional assays are needed to confirm the biological relevance of likely deleterious mutations, which will further facilitate a more thorough classification of CM subsets.']",

Mechanistically, RASA1 required RasGAP activity to suppress colony formation and showed higher activity toward R-Ras (related RAS viral (r-ras) oncogene homolog) isoform among the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. Moreover, RASA1 consistently suppressed Ral-A among Ras downstream effectors. Reduced R-Ras or Ral-A expression via siRNAs suppressed anchorage-independent growth induced by RASA1 loss. Interestingly, RASA1 expression was frequently down-regulated in metastatic melanoma samples (11.4% (4/35) of lymph node metastasis and 3.4% (1/29) of distal metastases) compared to primary melanomas (33.3% (21/63)) and dysplastic nevi (44.1% (15/34)). We also observed significantly shorter overall survival of melanoma patients with BRAF mutations when RASA1 mRNA expression is low, which may be explained by possible cooperative interactions between activation of BRAF/MAPK/ERK and RASA1/R-Ras/Ral-A pathways.

Numerous recurrent clustered hotspot mutations were identified in melanoma whole exome and genome data sets in proximal promoters, with some gene-associated clusters present in up to 25% of cases. Mutations were clustered around canonical ETS and SP1 transcription factor binding sites and had a clear UV signature. These promoter mutations correlated with overall mutation load and NF1 mutation status, and showed significant enrichment in specific melanoma subtypes (desmoplastic and lentigo maligna melanoma), sun exposed anatomical locations, male gender, ulceration and increasing age. Identical clusters were identified in BCC and MCC samples, including several previously annotated in melanoma. In conclusion, we identify a novel class of mutation in cutaneous malignancies which rather than being defined by a particular genomic position are related to a position in a transcription factor binding motif. These mutations are also independent of cell of origin. Clinicopathologic correlation and mutation analysis support an etiologic role for chronic UV irradiation.']",

Methods', '    We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on 8 pairs of metastatic tumor and germline DNA from 3 superficial spreading (SSM), 3 nodular (NM) and 2 acral lentiginous (ALM) melanoma patients. For two of the NM patients we also performed WES on DNA from corresponding primary lesions. Tumor DNA was isolated from FFPE samples in quantities that facilitated an average coverage of 100X for 95% of the exon regions; on average, 60M reads per sample were obtained, without applying whole genome amplification. We performed variant calling using paired samples with Somatic Sniper, SAM tools and MuTect. We annotated all the variants and applied functional filters to come up with a candidate list of mutations.  Results', '    Our analysis confirmed known mutations that occur predominantly in each subtype (BRAF V600E more prevalent in SSM than in NM and absent in ALM, ALM being NF1 mutant but not BRAF V600E or NRAS Q61 mutant) and further revealed subtype-restricted somatic mutations in genes not previously reported as associated with melanoma. In particular, matrix-remodeling associated 5 was found to be frequently mutated in the SSM samples tested but not in the ALM or NM samples, and PFN1P2 (profilin 1 pseudogene) in NM samples but not in the ALM or SSM samples. Sanger sequencing is underway to validate the presence of the selected mutations in a larger independent cohort of patient specimens representing the 3 histologic subtypes.

        "Background":"['Of the four molecular subtypes of melanoma (BRAF, NRAS, NF1, and triple WT), NRAS mutant tumors are notoriously more aggressive and challenging to treat. The frequent occurrence of NRAS mutationsin benign, congenital nevi suggests that these genetic alterations are early events in melanoma genesis. Since NRAS mutant nevi can remain indolent for years, or even a lifetime, secondary genetic events must be required to drive melanoma initiation. Ultraviolet (UV) light, a major risk factor for melanoma, is known to directly damage DNA and alter the skin microenvironment. Therefore, we hypothesized that the cell-extrinsic andintrinsic events triggered by UV exposure would cooperate with NrasQ61R mutations to drive melanoma formation in vivo. To test this hypothesis we employed a genetically engineered mouse model (i.e. TpN61R) that combines CRE-inducible expression of NrasQ61R with the loss of p16INK4a in melanocytes. Following neonatal CRE induction, we exposed TpN61R mice to a single, nonerythemic dose of UVB radiation and monitored them for the development of melanoma. Exposure to UVB radiation dramatically reduced the melanoma-free survival of TpN61R mice by 80% and increased tumor multiplicity (average 1.2 to 3.4 tumors/mouse); however, it had no impact on tumor growth rates, overall skin proliferation, immune infiltration, or vascularity. To test the respective roles of NrasQ61R and p16INK4a loss in UV-induced melanoma genesis, we generated mice with either melanocytic NrasQ61R expression or p16INK4a loss. Mice with p16INK4a loss alone did not develop tumors in the presence or absence of UV. By contrast, in UV treated TN61R mice, NrasQ61R was sufficient to initiate melanoma formation, albeit with a 66% longer latency than UV exposed TpN61R animals (9.14wks vs. 5.5wks). To determine if NrasQ61R mutations had to be present at the time of UV exposure to drive early melanoma formation, TpN61R mice were exposed to UV prior to CRE activation. Even when NrasQ61R expression was induced three days after UV exposure, melanoma formation was rapidly accelerated. Therefore, NRAS mutations do not need to be present at time of UV exposure to promote early melanoma formation. Genomic analyses comparing spontaneous and UV-induced TpN61R melanomas failed to uncover common secondary mutations that explain the exquisite cooperativity between NrasQ61R and UV light in driving melanoma formation. For this reason, we sought to identify UV-induced, cell-extrinsic factors that might facilitate the initiation of NrasQ61R mutant melanomas via cytokine profiling. Through these analyses we identified UV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines that could be therapeutically targeted to limit the initiation of NRAS-mutant melanomas. Together, this work explains why UV exposure is such a significant risk factor for melanoma and provides original mechanistic insight into how this deadly disease might be prevented.']",

Ras isoforms can also be activated by inactivation of Ras GTPase activating proteins (RasGAPs), such as NF1, RASA1, and RASA2. In our recent study, we observed that inactivation of RASA1 (RAS p21 protein activator 1, also called p120RasGAP) suppressed melanoma via its RasGAP activity toward the R-Ras (related RAS viral (r-ras) oncogene homolog) isoform and that R-Ras was required to promote anchorage-independent growth driven by RASA1 inactivation. Moreover, a low level of RASA1 mRNA expression is associated with decreased overall survival in melanoma patients with BRAF mutations. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that, although not mutated, R-Ras is activated in melanoma by inactivation of RasGAPs and that BRAF activation cooperates with this RasGAP/R-Ras pathway activation in melanoma tumorigenesis. In this study, we addressed the importance of R-Ras, a previously less appreciated member of the Ras small GTPases family, in melanoma tumorigenesis. We observed frequent activation of R-Ras in BRAF mutant human melanoma cell lines. In addition, RNAi-mediated reduced expression of R-Ras suppressed anchorage-independent colony growth and tumor growth. Moreover, among the 3 major RAS effector pathways, reduced R-Ras expression suppressed Ral-A activation, which may explain the mechanism of Ral-A activation in BRAF mutant melanoma. Interestingly, anchorage-independent growth driven by R-Ras activation downstream of RASA1 inactivation was suppressed by both genetic (siRNA targeting Ral-A) and pharmacological (Ral inhibitor BQU57) inhibition of Ral-A. To further investigate the impact of RASA1 loss, and thus R-Ras activation, on BRAF mutant melanoma development in vivo, we generated a RASA1L/L; BRAFCA/CA; Tyr-CreERT2 mouse model in which treatment with 4OHT results in expression of constitutively activated mutant BRAF and deletion of RASA1 in melanocytic lineage cells. Preliminary analysis shows hyperpigmentation of the ear, tail, and foot pad in RASA1L/L BRAFCA/CA mice compared to RASA1+/+ BRAFCA/CA littermates. Tumors generated in this animal model will be analyzed to determine the extent of R-Ras and Ral-A activity in vivo.

Furthermore, approximately 20-40% of V600E mutant tumors are intrinsically resistant to BRAFi. Suitable models for studying mechanisms of acquired and intrinsic resistance to BRAFi are therefore necessary. In the present study, we applied deep sequencing techniques to identify possible mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance in our collection of melanoma patient-derived xenograft models (MEXFs) treated with BRAFi.Mutational and expression profiles in MEXFs were characterized by whole-exome sequencing (WES) and HG-U133 Plus 2.0 Affymetrix chips and correlated with BRAFi efficacy data from 3D Tumor Clonogenic Assays (TCA). In addition, four resistant cell lines were created by continuously treating 2D monolayer cultures of tumor cells with Vemurafenib, all of which were initially sensitive to BRAFi and carry the BRAF V600E mutation. Expression profiles and mutations of these cell lines were analyzed from RNA-seq data. Potential gene candidates responsible for conferring resistance were further investigated by Q-PCR and Western-blot experiments.WES data revealed that the number of mutations per model was highly variable. Some MEXFs showed a hyper-mutated profile (>2000 mutations) and were characterized by specific mutational signatures in agreement with those found in melanoma (Alexandrov et al, Nature, 2013). Mutation frequencies of genes typically mutated in melanoma are very similar to those found in The Cancer Genome Atlas. We observed a high correlation of mutations between our MEXFs and their respective cell lines. Among the models with a V600E mutation, only one (MEXF 462) showed resistance to BRAFi-treatment as identified by 3D TCA analyses. In this model, we identified gene point mutations and a high over-expression of EGFR, MEK1, PDGFRA and NF1 in contrast to the other models, suggesting a specific regulation of the RTK signaling pathways. In 2D assays, synergistic interaction of Vemurafenib and Erlotinib was shown. RNA-seq analysis of the cell line established from MEXF 276, in which resistance to Vemurafenib was induced, revealed around 20% of genes being differentially expressed (FC>2) between sensitive and resistant cell lines. An up-regulation of EGFR was also found in this resistant cell line and was confirmed by Western-blot. In addition, an overexpression of PLAU, a biomarker of invasiveness, was identified. We currently perform expression profiling of three other models resistant to BRAFi. Preliminary results suggest different patterns of gene regulation involved in acquisition of resistance. A precise map of transcriptomic and mutational profiles of the four cell lines will be generated and we are investigating if invasiveness is increased upon acquisition of resistance.']",

Methods', '  We identified a family with hereditary predisposition for UM  the proband of which is a young female diagnosed with UM at age 16 who within 6 months developed liver metastases. We also identified two older paternal relatives who were diagnosed with UM at 39 and 44 years of age, respectively. We performed massively parallel sequencing using the Illumina Hiseq2000 technology on germline DNA from the proband, her parents and a healthy sibling. After QC and mapping against the human reference genome the average coverage across the exome was between 35 and 86 for the four sequenced samples.  Results', '  Out of more than 260,000 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertion / deletion variants (indels), 51 gene variants were filtered out by being novel, shared by the affected proband and her father (considered an obligate mutation carrier), but not by the healthy mother, of predicted functional importance and /or located within strongly conserved regions. The strongest candidate among these was a loss of function-variant in the BAP1 gene, since BAP1 has been suggested as a tumor suppressor in several cancer-related syndromes, including cases of UM. The sequence data indicated an insertion of one base-pair in exon 3 of the BAP1 genecausing a frame-shift and subsequently a truncated protein lacking all its functional domains. The mutation was also present in UM tumor tissue from the two deceased paternal relatives and was found to segregate with the UM phenotype in the family. We also detected loss of heterozygosity in the tumor of the proband, supporting BAP1 as the causative gene in this family.  Conclusions', '  The identification of BAP1 as the gene responsible for this syndrome is the first demonstration of a germline mutation causing UM.

So far, whole genome sequencing (WGS) and whole exome sequencing (WES) has been implemented in both research and clinical settings to identify oncogenic events in cancer genomes. However, a large number of passenger mutations have been identified and true driver mutations have been disguised. Distinguishing driver events from passenger events will be a key challenge for the realization of targeted therapy. To elucidate driver mutations that are clinically actionable, the Institute for Personalized Cancer Therapy at MD Anderson cancer center has developed a NGS clinical sequencing platform, T200, to sequence 202 cancer-related genes at high depth in thousands of cancer patients at MD Anderson.Materials and MethodsThe T200 mutation data, including single nucleotide variants (SNV, variant allele frequency >=1%) and copy number variations (CNV), of more than 500 cancer patients treated in MD Anderson Cancer Center were utilized in our study.Results1. By analyzing the SNV data, we identified several sets of co-occurring genes across all cancers. Some sets such as KRAS/APC/SMAD4 contain driver genes from multiple signaling pathways, which may indicate essential mechanisms for tumor development and nominate targets for combinational therapy.2. We elucidated mutual-exclusive mutations that were from genes in the same or different pathways. Several sets of well-known mutual-exclusive SNVs were verified in our analysis such as BRAF/NRAS SNVs in melanoma. We also illustrated novel sets of mutual-exclusive mutational events, such as IDH1/PTEN/PPP1R3A SNVs in brain tumors and EGFR/FGFR3/GNAS/NOTCH4 CNVs in all cancers.3. SNVs of more than 10 genes were enriched in specific cancer types, such as IDH1 and NF1 in brain tumor, BRAF and MITF in melanoma. CNVs of more than 50 genes were found enriched in one cancer type, such as PDGFRA amplifications in brain tumors and IL6R amplifications in breast cancer. We observed not only expected cancer specific mutations such as BRAF SNVs but also novel mutations such as NF1 SNVs and PDGFRA amplifications.4. We performed mutual-exclusivity and cancer type enrichment analysis on SNV hotspots. More than 20 SNV hotspots were elucidated, such as BRAF(V600E) in melanoma, IDH1(R132H) in brain tumors, KRAS(G12D) in colorectal cancer, and PIK3CA(H1047L) in breast cancer. In addition, multiple SNV hotspots were found to occur mutual-exclusively, such as BRAF(V600E)/IDH1(R132H)/MPL(L532V) in brain tumors.ConclusionDeep target sequencing enables us to systematically determine the potential driver mutation events (including low allele frequency SNVs), which not only help us characterize the landscape of cancer genomic alterations, but also provide comprehensive patient molecular profile to facilitate clinical decision-making and novel clinical trial design.']",

        "Background":"['Tumor samples harbor a vast number of genomic alterations of various kinds, and it is difficult to distinguish driver alterations that contribute to oncogenesis from passenger alterations. Most computational methods identify driver genes by focusing on the most frequent copy number alterations. Previous work in our lab has led to the development of CONEXIC, a Bayesian algorithm that identifies candidate driver genes in cancer and links them to gene expression signatures they govern by integrating copy number and gene expression (Akavia et al, Cell, 2010). This algorithm was applied to data from melanoma cell lines, where it correctly identified known drivers, such as MITF and KLF6, and connected them to their known targets. In addition, it predicted novel tumor dependencies not previously implicated in melanoma, which were validated experimentally. Drivers may act concurrently, where not only the strongest one is important. For example, either PTEN deletion or AKT activation can lead to a similar expression signature and phenotype. Therefore, we developed a new algorithm, based on the same principles as CONEXIC, with multiple improvements. The new algorithm - Multi-Reg - is capable of detecting multiple candidate regulators that can all act in parallel to regulate an expression signature, and is also capable of integrating mutations in addition to copy number and gene expression data. We applied Multi-Reg to glioblastoma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This data includes copy number, gene expression and mutations for hundreds of primary tumor samples. Multi-Reg has identified putative drivers that were missed by CONEXIC, such as the known genes PDGFRA and NF1, in addition to EGFR & ERB2 (identified by CONEXIC). Additionally, since Multi-Reg candidate drivers act in parallel, we can group them by shared targets. For example, EGFR & ERRB2 induce the same genes, which represent the Mesenchymal subtype of glibolastoma. These same genes are repressed by PDGFRA & NF1. This matches the known behavior of glioblastoma subtypes, where EGFR & PDGFRA characterize the Mesenchymal and Proneural subtypes, respectively. Thus, our results correctly identify known drivers of glioblastoma. Additionally, Multi-Reg results identified RHPN2 as a novel oncogenic factor controlling a gene expression signature related to adhesion. Validation has shown that while RHPN2 has no effect on cell proliferation it induces invasiveness in glioblastoma cell lines. This shows that Multi-Reg cannot only discover drivers, but can link them to the oncogenic phenomena they controls, and suggest the appropriate biological validation for it.']",

Targeted drugs usually induce rapid tumor death leading to the release of neoantigens, and can affect immune development pathways, which could increase the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor treatment. Assessment of somatic mutation profiles from large public databases provides an estimate of the prevalence of targetable somatic mutations and the burden of somatic nonsynonymous mutations (NsM), used as a surrogate for overall neoantigen load, which, in turn, correlates with clinical utility of checkpoint inhibitors for melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma. The rational design of these combinations based on somatic genomic profiles offers a prioritization scheme for new clinical trials.

However, a substantial subset of solid tumors does not express these markers, exemplified by the triple-negative subtype of breast cancer. Shared molecular factors that promote the progression of these tumors, and that represent a target for their therapy, are missing. We previously described a role for PHIP (Pleckstrin Homology domain-Interacting Protein) in the progression of melanoma, and demonstrated PHIP activation in triple-negative melanomas. Analysis of the TCGA profiling efforts in melanoma, breast and lung cancer revealed PHIP expression to be enriched in triple-negative breast cancer and in the bronchiad subtype of triple-negative lung cancer. Here we show the broad-based role of PHIP in the progression of triple-negative subtypes of three solid tumors (breast and lung cancer, and melanoma) defined by different mutational drivers and targeted therapies. By using a shRNA-based targeting of PHIP in in vitro and in vivo models, we have suppressed the malignant phenotype of triple-negative MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 human breast carcinoma cells. In addition, PHIP knockdown resulted in significant anti tumor effects in H1703 and Calu3 human lung cancer cells lacking mutations in EGFR, KRAS, and ALK, and in two short-term triple wild type melanoma cultures lacking mutations in BRAF, NRAS, and NF1. Suppression of PHIP expression resulted in inhibition of both tumor cell proliferation by cell survival and colony formation assays and invasion into matrigel in each of the tumor models examined, and was accompanied by suppression of pAKT, CCND1, TLN1, and ITGβ1 expression when assessed by western-blot or quantitative immunofluorescence. The PHIP protein contains two bromodomains that can be therapeutically targeted by small molecules. However, the functional activity of the PHIP bromodomains has been poorly characterized. We show that PHIP co-localizes with and binds to the acetylated histone modification H4K91ac, and that both are coordinately regulated upon growth factor stimulation suggesting a new function for PHIP as a chromatin remodeler. To conclude, our results identify a novel role for PHIP in the progression of solid tumors lacking the major molecular drivers, and suggest PHIP as a druggable target for the therapy of these malignancies.']",

        "Background":"[\"Mutant BRAF gene can lead to uncontrolled cell growth through overactivation of RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling pathway. BRAF V600E mutation occurs in approximately 40% to 50% of melanomas. Although BRAF inhibitors have been used to successfully treat melanomas containing the BRAF V600E mutation, patients often become resistant to BRAF inhibitors within a few months. A number of studies have indicated that secondary mutations such as NRAS or NF1 are significantly associated with BRAF resistance by sequencing patient samples. However, due to the genetic heterogeneity commonly observed in tumors, it is unclear if those secondary mutations already existed within low percentage subclones or if they were acquired through drug treatment. It's yet to be determined whether such genetic variants are only associated with resistance, or they actually cause the resistance. In this study, we used genome editing CRISPR technology to generate a drug resistant mutation NRAS Q61K within A375 melanoma cell line which naturally contains BRAFV600E. When compared to the parental line, this isogenic cell model demonstrated that genetically modified NRAS gene at the endogenous level directly leads to a significant resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Method and results\", ' Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed and built to guide Cas9 to bind and cut desired regions in the NRAS gene target. Melanoma cell line A375 was co-transfected with the single guide and CRIPSR all-in-one plasmid alongside donor plasmid. Transfected cells were sorted into single cells and expanded for subsequent screening of desired gene mutation events. The introduction of NRAS Q61K mutation in the cells was then confirmed via Sanger sequencing and NGS at the genetic level and transcriptional level. Drug responses to BRAF specific inhibitors and non-specific chemotherapy drugs were compared between A375 NRAS Q61K isogenic cell line and parental cell line in 2D and 3D culture environment. Testing results demonstrated that the isogenic cell line created by CRISPR showed significant resistance to BRAF inhibitor in comparison to the parental control in both 2D and 3D culture environment. In summary, we utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing platform to target endogenous loci in human cells and create the intended genetic mutation event. This new approach provides direct bio-functional evidence of acquiring a drug resistant gene drives tumor cells survival under targeted therapeutic treatment. Furthermore, unlike conventional drug resistant cell models that have been developed through drug selection, the A375 NRAS Q61K isogenic cell line represents a new type of drug resistant model that contains a defined genetic resistance mechanism. It reserves the permanent and genetically stable resistance characteristics without being maintained in drug selection culture environment. Therefore, it provides a valuable tool for developing next generation therapeutics that can overcome BRAF drug resistant in melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['The RAS/RAF/MEK pathway is a major driver of malignant progression, particularly in cancers arising from mutations in RAS, BRAF and NF1. Although both BRAF and MEK inhibitors have been approved for treatment of melanoma, their clinical activity is commonly limited by acquired resistance due to reactivation of the pathway downstream of their targets. Since the ERK1/2 kinases are the final node in the MAPK signaling pathway, they are not subject to the feedback reactivation mechanisms that can undermine RAF or MEK blockade, offering the possibility of clinical benefit in settings where earlier drugs are ineffective. Here we describe the characterization of KO-947, a potent and selective inhibitor of ERK1/2 kinases, in biochemical, cellular and in vivo antitumor activity assays. KO-947 was profiled in vitro in biochemical activity assays, competition binding assays, and a probe-based competition binding assay in cell lysates, and subsequently screened in a large panel of human tumor cell lines focused on MAPK-dysregulated tumor types. In vivo studies were carried out in well-characterized xenograft models of BRAF-, KRAS- and NRAS-mutant disease and subsequently extended to a large panel of early-passage patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models representative of a wide range of tumor types and molecular profiles. Biochemical assays reveal that KO-947 is a 10nM inhibitor of ERK with at least 50-fold selectivity against a panel of 450 kinases. KO-947 blocks ERK signaling and proliferation of tumor cells exhibiting dysregulation of MAPK pathway signaling, including mutations in BRAF, NRAS or KRAS, at low nanomolar concentrations. KO-947 is differentiated from other published ERK inhibitors by an extended residence time and high potency in cell engagement that translate into prolonged pathway inhibition in vitro and in vivo. In cell-line derived xenograft studies, the drug profoundly suppresses ERK signaling for up to five days after a single dose and induces regressions in RAS- and RAF-mutant melanoma, NSCLC and pancreatic cancer models on administration schedules ranging from daily to weekly. Intermittent dosing enables comparable antitumor activity at reduced dose-intensity. PDX screening confirms and extends these findings to include RAS and BRAF mutant colorectal, gastric and cervical carcinoma models, and robust activity is also seen on both weekly and Q2D schedules in tumor models lacking BRAF/RAS mutations but with other dysregulation of the MAPK pathway. Thus, the favorable ADME properties of KO-947 enable the achievement of optimal antitumor activity with intermittent dosing, which may provide an opportunity to maximize the therapeutic window with flexible administration routes and schedules. These results demonstrate the potential clinical utility of KO-947 in MAPK pathway dysregulated tumors.']",

Primary lesions of HS appear in the spleen, lymph nodes, lung, bone marrow, skin and hypodermis. The definitive cell of origin, genetic etiology, and critical drug targets for HS therapy are unknown. To address all three questions we have utilized a forward genetic screening method in mice that can identify mutations capable of causing cancer initiation and progression. The forward genetic screen uses the Sleeping Beauty (SB) DNA transposon as a random somatic mutagen, capable of both activating proto-oncogenes and inactivating tumor suppressor genes. The system relies on the use of a Cre/LoxP-regulated SB transposase transgene and mutagenic transposon vector transgenes that are mobilized by the transposase. Using Cre recombinase under the control of a tissue specific promoter allows for selective, tissue specific mutagenesis in particular cells of interest. Tumors generated in these mice are analyzed for recurrent transposon insertion sites (called common insertion sites or CIS) using ligation-mediated PCR in combination with high-throughput sequencing. As in human cancer, our results often reveal a small number of frequently mutated genes that cooperate with a greater number of rare mutant genes that drive formation of tumors. We hypothesized that SB-mediated transposition of an oncogenic transposon in myeloid lineage cells in mice could cause mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes leading to the initiation and progression of HS. We generated and aged 190 experimental and control transgenic mice. The triple transgenic, experimental mice express SB transposase in myeloid lineage cells containing an oncogenic transposon by virtue of a Cre recombinase transgene under the control of the Lysozyme M promoter, which is expressed in committed myeloid lineage cells. Remarkably, triple transgenic mice became moribund much faster than controls. Histopathology suggests 30% of the experimental mice developed HS. We have performed immunohistochemistry to confirm the tumor type using antibodies to Mac-2, F4/80 and PAX5. Tumors were analyzed by mapping transposon insertions to the mouse genome from many independently generated tumors. We mapped 1,177 non-redundant insertions and generated a list of 23 candidate HS genes comprised of known cancer genes as well as novel candidate genes. Our top 3 hits are Raf1 and Fli1, known oncogenes associated with hematological neoplasms, and Mitf, a transcription factor associated with melanoma. Our list also includes known tumor suppressors Trp53 and Nf1.

        "Background":"['Dysregulation of ERK signaling is a common event in malignancy. Receptor activation of RAS leads to dimerization and activation of RAF kinase, which in turn activates ERK. Physiologic activation of the pathway is limited by ERK dependent feedback inhibition of RAS activation and other components of the pathway. Oncogenic mutations and translocations of RAF family members have been identified in many human tumors and serve as drivers of tumor growth. We now show that these mutants are active despite feedback inhibition of RAS and that this is associated with dysregulated ERK output. All translocations and almost all of the RAF mutants tested so far form RAS-independent constitutive dimers, the activity of which is dependent on their dimerization. Mutations at one site, V600E and V600K allow RAF to function as a monomer in cells with low RAS activity and as a RAS-dependent dimer in cells with adequate RAS activity. In tumors expressing any of these mutants, RAF/MEK/ERK activity is elevated despite feedback inhibition of RAS. Currently available RAF inhibitors bind to one protomer of the RAF dimer and cause negative cooperativity of binding to the second site. This is sometimes associated with transactivation of the unbound protomer. These inhibitors cannot be used to inhibit ERK signaling in tumors in which ERK is driven by RAF-dimers (those with mutant RAS, NF1 loss, atypical RAF mutations, RAF translocations.) In contrast, in tumors with V600E BRAF mutations, ERK causes strong feedback inhibition of RAS and V600E BRAF exists as a monomer that is inhibited by these drugs. Acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors usually results from a molecular lesion that causes RAS-dependent or independent dimerization of V600E (NRAS mutation, V600E BRAF amplification, V600E aberrantly spliced isoform.) Current RAF inhibitors inhibit V600E BRAF dimers at concentrations 10-100 fold greater than those required to inhibit the corresponding monomer in cells. We take this as a provisional measure of the degree of negative cooperativity of binding to the second site. We have now identified inhibitors that inhibit V600E dimers at concentrations close (1-3 fold higher) than those required to inhibit the monomer. They do not cause dissociation of dimers and their inhibition is abolished by gatekeeper mutations. Phenotypically, therefore, binding of these compounds to dimers is associated with only minimal negative cooperativity. These drugs inhibit ERK signaling and the proliferation of tumor cells with atypical BRAF mutations and translocations as well as V600E melanoma models with acquired resistance to Vemurafenib. However, they are much less active in cancer cells with KRAS mutation or receptor-dependent activation of RAF. Selective inhibitors of subsets of RAF dimers may allow effective ERK inhibition of large subset of tumors without inhibiting signaling in normal cells.']",
