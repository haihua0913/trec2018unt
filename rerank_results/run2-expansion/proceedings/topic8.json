Methods', ' We searched for NRAS Q61 mutation by pyrosequencing method in 216 FFPE samples of cutaneous melanomas WT for BRAFV600. FISH was performed with probes specific for NRAS (RP11-245I3) and 1p34.1 (RP11-269F19) on 105 cases NRAS WT (n = 42), or NRAS mutant with equilibrate (E%, n = 43) and high (H%, n = 20) mutant allele percentage. Loss of Heterozygoty (LOH) was evaluated with 8 microsatellite (MS) markers (3 localized near NRAS, 3 at 1p and 2 at 1q) on 17 samples (E% n = 8 or H% n = 9). Pathological data of 73 NRASmutant melanomas, clinical characteristics and survival data of matching patients were analyzed. Results', 'NRAS mutation was detected in 109 (50.5%) of BRAF WT samples, of which 31 (34%) were H%. Allelic NRAS imbalance was observed in all mutation types', ' Q61R (n = 22), Q61K (n = 6), Q61L (n = 2) and Q61H (n = 1).

NRAS amplification and monosomy of chromosome 1 were rare aberrations in both groups (3.4% and 4.6%, respectively). Intra-tumor heterogeneity concerning chromosome 1 was defined as monosomic or polysomic cells (or both) accompanying disomic tumor cells. Heterogeneity was observed in 24% WT and 35% mutant NRAS samples (P < 0.01), and was more frequent in H% than E% mutant NRAS (47% vs 29.7%). MS analysis revealed no LOH in 8 E%, while LOH was present in 9 H% NRAS samples. No differences were observed between E% and H% NRAS mutant melanomas for clinic, histology and survival data. Conclusions', ' Allelic imbalance is more frequent in NRAS than in BRAF mutant melanomas (34% versus 19% of H%, P < 0.01). Amplification was rare in NRAS, as shown in BRAF mutant melanomas. NRAS mutant melanomas had high intra-tumor heterogeneity. Allelic imbalance of H% NRAS was closely related to LOH.']",

        "Background":"['Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive malignancy with a median survival of less than 1 year. Recent progresses have permitted the discovery of several activating mutations in the MAPK pathway that involves notably the BRAF and NRAS genes and have allowed the development of new targeted therapies. However response to these therapies is highly variable and the occurrence of new activating mutations refrain these progresses. Indeed investigation of the molecular profile of the tumors could help anticipate the occurrence of resistance. However given the multiplicity of redundant kinase pathways this strategy is hardly implementable today. Consequently the identification of other predictive biomarkers is of critical importance.DNA repair, a set of highly coordinated mechanisms, are the effectors of the DNA Damage Response (DDR). They are under the regulation of numerous transduction pathways (PIK3CA, MAPK, etc). Because of this downstream position, we aimed at investigating if the stratification of metastatic melanoma cells, based on the comparative quantification of multiple DNA Repair pathways (DNA Repair Enzyme Signature) reflected the functionality of the signaling pathways.For this purpose, we screened a biobank constituted by a set of 44 samples prepared from metastatic melanoma lymph nodes, dissociated and frozen right after surgery. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the cryopreserved cells. We then used a multiplexed Enzymatic DNA Excision/Synthesis Repair Assay on biochip to simultaneously quantify several DNA Repair pathways (Nucleotide and Base Excision Repair, Inter-Strand Cross-Link Repair). We thus obtained a specific and comprehensive overview of the DNA Repair capacities. Using the normalized data and hierarchical classification, patients were stratified into 3 significantly different main classes. Mutational status (BRAF V600E, NRAS Q61K and NRAS Q61R mutations) was available for most samples. We found out that 6 out of the 7 NRAS mutated samples were clustered in the same group and that 8 out of the 12 BRAF mutated samples were clustered in another group. Two BRAF mutated samples were atypical and clustered alone.Our results suggested that some mutations in the regulating signaling pathway impacted the DDR and were associated with specific DNA Repair Enzyme Signatures.However further studies are needed to more deeply examine if specific combination of DNA Repair-related parameters could serve as surrogate biomarker of signal transduction pathway functionality and could have a predictive value regarding the response to therapy.']",

Results', ' Among 25 pts with metastatic melanoma who received one of the combination regimens, tumor samples from 18 pts (14 in DTIC, 3 in Doc, 1 in Tems arms) were analyzed.

        "Background":"['Background', '  Although single-agent RAF inhibition has proved effective in metastatic BRAFV600-mutant melanoma, most patients relapse and some are intrinsically resistant. While several genetic resistance effectors have been identified, a comprehensive assessment of the genetic resistance spectrum in a large patient cohort may further inform resistance patterns and treatment strategies.  Methods', '  Pre-treatment and post-relapse biopsies were obtained from BRAFV600melanoma patients treated with vemurafenib or dabrafenib. Whole exome sequencing of tumor and normal samples was performed to identify exome-wide mutations, insertion/deletions, and chromosomal copy number alterations. Since somatic allelic fraction comparisons across treatment time points must account for variable stromal admixture between biopsies, novel algorithms were applied to impute purity and tumor cell ploidy, thus determining the cancer cell fraction (CCF) of each alteration. Those with enriched CCF in post-relapse samples were nominated as potential resistance effectors.  Results', '  30 patients (towards a goal of 77) were sequenced to a mean depth of 145-fold coverage. In acquired resistance patients (on drug  12 weeks, n=18), NRAS Q61R (28%) and BRAF amplifications (6%) were observed. The remaining patients had multiple clonally enriched alterations in the post-relapse tumors that may drive resistance, including MEK1 mutations at residues previously noted in an in vitro mutagenesis screen for vemurafenib resistance. In the intrinsic resistance cohort (on drug < 12 weeks, n=12), multiple putative resistance mutations not previously observed in the setting of acquired resistance were identified.  Conclusions', '  In addition to reported genetic resistance mechanisms, we identified new MEK1 mutations in resistant samples. For the majority of patients (67%) without events in these genes, computational algorithms identified new candidate drivers of RAF inhibitor resistance. Alterations that predict intrinsic or acquired resistance may also inform new approaches to melanoma therapy.

Here we report, for the first time, two coexisting yet mutually exclusive mechanisms of escape in a melanoma patient who presented an excellent clinical response following reintroduction of vemurafenib.  Methods', '    To investigate the mechanisms of resistance to vemurafenib, we performed whole-exome sequencing using the Illumina technology of a pre-treatment paraffin-embedded lymph node metastasis (Pre) and of two progressing subcutaneous snap-frozen metastases of the right arm (PV1 and PV2). The tumor samples, along with germline controls, were sequenced at high coverage (mean range 268x-356x).   Results', '    We identified 107 exonic somatic Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) in Pre, 139 SNVs in PV1, and 127 SNVs in PV2, generating a set of 202 different SNVs, 82 of which were common to all 3 samples. The non-synonymous to synonymous ratios were higher for PV1 (1.82) than for PV2 (1.46), and lower for Pre (1.31). C>T transitions, largely predominated in the samples, indicating light-induced damage. Two independent NRAS escape mutations (Q61K and Q61R) where observed in PV1, whereas appearance of a BRAF splice variant (lack of exon 4-10) was present in PV2. Most importantly, these 2 escape mechanisms were mutually exclusive, i.e. no BRAF splice variant was observed by PCR in PV1 and no NRAS mutation found in PV2.  Conclusions', '    Our results clearly demonstrate that multiple molecular escape mechanisms can be both coexistent and mutually exclusive. These findings have clinical implications', ' firstly, local treatment of isolated progressing lesions and continuation of vemurafenib could be supported by the fact that the resistance mechanisms are not necessarily shared. This approach is currently being tested within clinical trials with preliminary results that seem to support this hypothesis. Secondly, the coexistence of divergent escapes within the same patient strongly argues that single biopsy analysis at progression might not reflect the molecular complexity of tumor progression, and therefore might not be sufficient to guide selection of second-line optimal combination therapy.']",

Despite significant advances in targeted and immunotherapies, most patients cannot still be cured. Our aim is to identify new drug combinations that are synergistic in BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma, a sub-type representing 30% of cases for which targeted therapies are not currently available. We high-throughput screened a collection of 20 BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma cell lines with 180 drug combinations (60 library drugs used at 5 different concentrations combined with 3 clinically relevant anchor drugs) and generated over 8000 survival curves . We found that 25% of cell lines are highly sensitive to a combination of nilotinib plus trametinib and confirmed this finding with 2 independent assays. We further validated the drug synergy firstly using an independent collection of BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma cell lines (n=7), then a collection of BRAF/NRAS wild type patient derived xenotransplant cultures (n=3), and finally with a collection of BRAFV600E and NRASQ61 melanoma cell lines (n=12). Further, we generated a gene expression signature of cell lines that display synergy for the nilotinib/trametinib combination, and used it to classify human melanomas from Leeds Melanoma Project (N=171) and TCGA (n=470) cohorts. Tumors classified as “synergistic-like” (27.9 and 36.7%, respectively) are associated to decreased overall and recurrence free survival (P<0.05), suggesting that our combination might be effective in a relevant fraction of aggressive tumors. In order to identify drug resistance mechanisms we deployed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen. We found that loss of the tuberous sclerosis complex can confer resistance to nilotinib/trametinib, and validated this mechanism using clonal engineered lines. Since tuberous sclerosis complex genes are mutated in 10% of melanomas, this approach can help to identify patients potentially refractory to the treatment. We also investigated the molecular mechanism of nilotinib/trametinib synergy by analysing the level of several phosphoproteins upon treatment. We discovered that the nilotinib/trametinib combination synergistically reduce the level of P-ERK in synergistic cell lines but not in cell lines resistant to the drug combination, thus pointing out the MAPK pathway dependence of the synergy. This finding provides a putative marker to identify tumors responsive to the treatment. Finally, we tested in vivo the nilotinib/trametinib combination in a patient derived xenotransplant mouse model and showed that the combination is well tolerated and significantly more effective than the 2 drugs alone (P<0.01). These data suggest a strong clinical translation potential for nilotinib/trametinib combination and pave the way to the development of clinical trials for BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma.']",

Our previous studies showed that EphA2 levels are elevated in melanoma cells and EphA2 plays critical roles in melanoma cell survival, proliferation, colony formation and migration in vitro and melanoma tumor growth in vivo. Together, these data suggest that EphA2 is a critical oncogene in melanoma and a potential pharmacologic target in the treatment of metastatic disease.

        "Background":"['Cutaneous melanoma claims the life of one American every hour, and while the etiology of this tumor type is not entirely understood, exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation (280-340nm) is a major risk factor. For this reason, the use of UV-blocking sunscreens is strongly advocated; however, few studies have tested the relative efficacy of these agents in preventing melanoma formation in vivo. Here, we employed a new genetically engineered mouse model (TpN61R) to examine the ability of 6 chemically distinct SPF30 sunscreens to prevent melanoma. In this TpN61R model, topical 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) treatment induces the melanocyte-specific expression of oncogenic NRas as well as inactivation of the p16INK4a tumor suppressor. These genetic lesions co-occur in 24% of all human melanomas, making the TpN61R model biologically relevant. Since NRAS mutations are an early and UV-independent event in human melanoma, TpN61R mice were first painted with 4OHT and then exposed to a single dose of 4.5 kJ/m2 UVB light one day later. Exposed skin from TpN61R mice showed transient cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) formation, however no evidence of edema or inflammation was observed. Despite these mild effects, UVB exposure reduced the melanoma-free survival of TpN61R mice by 80% and increased tumor incidence rate from 1.2 to 3.4 tumors/mouse. Further experiments using a variety of UVB doses (0.25, 1.0, 2.3 and 9.0 kJ/m2) in the TpN61R model revealed a dose-dependent increase in early melanoma incidence. Together, these data establish the exquisite cooperation of UV light and oncogenic NRas mutations in driving melanoma. Taking advantage of this unique model, we tested the preventative efficacy of SPF30 sunscreens with differing chemical composition. Sunscreens components included UVA (avobenzene), UVB (homosalate, octisalate) and broad spectrum (oxybenzone, octocrylene, zinc oxide) blocking agents. Application of sunscreen prior to UVB exposure decreased DNA damage, delayed melanoma onset and reduced tumor incidence in a sunscreen-dependent manner. Thus, SPF30 sunscreens do not equally prevent UVB-induced, NRAS mutant melanoma. This work establishes the first in vivo system to test sunscreen efficacy in NRAS-driven melanoma and will help direct the development of improved melanoma preventatives.']",

Currently, there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies effective in vemurafenib-resistant BRAFV600E mutant, NRAS mutant, or wild-type melanoma. The effect of SCH722984, an allosteric inhibitor of ERK 1/2, was determined in a panel of 53 melanoma cell lines, including wild-type, NRAS-mutant and vemurafenib-sensitive and resistant BRAF-mutant melanoma. 54% (13 of 24) of BRAF mutants, including 4 with innate vemurafenib resistance, were sensitive to SCH722984 with an IC50 <1M. 100% (3 of 3) of BRAF/NRAS double mutants, 71% (10 of 14) of NRAS mutants and 71% (5 of 7) of wild-type melanomas were sensitive. 13% (5 of 24) of BRAF mutants, 14% (2 of 14) of NRAS mutants and 29% (2 of 7) of wild-type melanomas were intermediately sensitive (IC50 1-1.5M).

Combining vemurafenib and SCH722984 in BRAF mutant melanoma was synergistic in a majority of cell lines, resulting in up to 10-fold decrease in the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) and with combination indices (CI) below 1. SCH722984 inhibited phosphorylation of RSK, an ERK downstream target. Finally, long term cultures of two BRAFV600E-mutant cell lines sensitive to SCH722984 showed that treatment with SCH722984 alone or in combination with vemurafenib was more potent than vemurafenib alone and resulted in a significant delay in developing acquired resistance.

Thus, there is a need for improved understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and more effective targeted therapies for this devastating disease. The recent work of The Cancer Genome Atlas Network has defined melanoma as an RTK/RAS-driven solid tumor that can be classified into four genomic subtypes', ' BRAF-mutant, RAS-mutant, NF1-mutant, and triple-wild-type. This landmark study highlighted the important role of the previously understudied NF1 tumor suppressor in melanoma pathogenesis, especially for the 9% of melanoma patients who have acquired inactivating NF1-mutations, but lack hotspot mutations that activate BRAF or RAS. To date, animal models have not been developed for the NF1-mutant subtype of melanoma, which has significantly impaired the development of novel therapeutic strategies for this subtype. Here we report the first zebrafish model for NF1-mutant melanoma, which we generated by combining the loss of nf1 with loss of both pten and p53. The resultant compound mutant zebrafish develop aggressive melanomas from the age of 7 weeks and the tumor penetrance is 80% by the age of 18 weeks. We demonstrate further that these high-risk zebrafish melanomas were exclusive of hotspot mutations of braf and nras. Sustained inhibition of both MEK and PI3K suppressed tumor progression in vivo, whereas inhibition of MEK or PI3K alone was insufficient to suppress the growth of these tumors. Surprisingly, single agent therapy with rapamycin, an MTOR inhibitor, proved even better for short- and long-term suppression of tumor cell growth in nf1/pten-mutant melanomas.

Mutated, oncogenic forms of Ras are found in colon, pancreatic, and lung cancers; BRAF mutations have been identified in more than 60% of malignant melanomas and from 40-60% of papillary thyroid cancers. MEK, a dual specific kinase, is a key player in this pathway; it is downstream of both Ras and Raf and activates ERK1/2 through phosphorylation of key tyrosine and threonine residues. MEK162 (ARRY 438162) is a novel small molecule ATP-uncompetitive inhibitor of the kinases MEK1 and MEK2. MEK162 showed promising data in an ongoing Phase 2 Clinical Trial in patients with BRAF and NRAS mutated advanced melanoma. This is the first targeted therapy to show activity in patients with NRAS mutated melanoma. Methods and Results. The melanoma cell line panel was the most sensitive after investigating the growth inhibitory effect of MEK162 on 328 cancer cell lines from diverse histologies including melanoma, head and neck, colon, pancreas, lung, ovarian, liver, kidney, breast and endometrial. When a cutoff of IC50 <500nM or >70% Inhibition at 1uM after 6 days of culture was used 83% out of 47 melanoma cell lines were sensitive to the treatment with the MEK inhibitor. Sensitivity to MEK162 was independent of BRAFV600E andNRASQ61mutation status in this cell line panel. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was assessed upon exposure to MEK162 using flow cytometry. MEK162 led to a G1 arrest and marked increase in apoptotic cells in the majority of the sensitive melanoma cell lines regardless of their origin and oncogenic driver mutations. Western blots were used to characterize the changes induced by exposure to MEK162 in the MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathways. MEK1/2 inhibition resulted in a decrease in pERK in all the cell lines tested regardless of their mutational status and the in vitro sensitivity. We observed an increase in pMEK more prominently in NRASQ61L mutant and wild type for NRAS and BRAF mutations cell lines than in BRAFV600Emutant cell lines. We found pAKT and pS6 decreased in the NRAS and BRAF mutant cell lines after treatment, suggesting that the inhibition of the mTOR pathway by MEK162 may be crucial for the sensitivity to the drug.

Implementation and combination of different therapeutic modalities is therefore required to improve patient survival.Given the clinical efficacy of drug combinations for BRAF mutant melanomas, we performed a high-throughput drug screening to identify new drug combinations for the treatment of BRAF/NRAS wild type melanomas. Effective targeted therapies are not currently available for this sub-type of the disease, which represents up to 30% of melanomas. By viability assays we characterized the sensitivity to 240 combinations of clinically relevant drugs in a collection of 21 BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma cell lines. We analysed 8360 survival curves and found that 16 (73%) and 5 (23%) cell lines are highly sensitive to temozolomide plus olaparib and to nilotinib plus trametinib combinations, respectively. Two independent experimental approaches validated these drug synergies.By -omics technologies we deeply characterized the cell line profiles of mutations, copy number changes, DNA methylation, and gene and microRNA expression. We generated gene expression signatures of synergistic and resistant cell lines for the 2 drug combinations and used them to classify 374 human melanomas. Tumors significantly associated to nilotinib plus trametinib synergism signature were significantly enriched for high immune response and proliferative Jonsson's expression classes, while tumors associated to the signature of drug resistance are enriched for pigmentation class. Melanomas associated to temozolomide plus olaparib resistance signature displayed enrichment for normal class. We are currently confirming the representation of these signatures in an independent cohort of melanomas and looking for other clinical correlates. We are also validating the predictivity of these gene expression signatures in independent cohorts of melanoma cell lines. Prospectively, this may represent an approach to identify patients that could have the maximal benefit from these drug combinations.Additionally, we have recently performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify drug resistance genes for these 2 drug combinations.

To test this notion, we analyzed resistance to the RAF inhibitor, PLX4720, using mutant BRAF melanoma cell models. In a screen to isolate cells displaying resistance to the inhibitory effects of PLX4720, we observed a subset of cells harboring an acquired mutation in NRAS. In parental cells, expression of mutant NRAS was sufficient to prevent PLX4720-mediated inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling, entry into S phase and susceptibility to apoptosis in mutant BRAF cells. Effects of mutant NRAS were associated with the maintenance of RAF binding. Analysis of isolated clones of RAF inhibitor-resistant mutant BRAF cells demonstrated that re-activation of the ERK1/2 pathway in the presence of PLX4720 was dependent on NRAS, BRAF, CRAF, and the RAS-RAF scaffold protein, SHOC2/Sur-8. Depletion of SHOC2 also rendered resistant cells susceptible to PLX4720-mediated apoptosis in 3D collagen. Together, these data demonstrate the role of RAF isoforms and a RAS-RAF scaffold protein in the acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors induced by secondary mutations in NRAS.']",

        "Background":"['Our pre-clinical in vitro data suggested that all BRAF-mutated cell lines, and some NRAS-mutated melanoma are sensitive to MEK inhibition. BRAFwt/NRASwt were uniformly resistant. Among the sensitive cell lines, those with enhanced activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway did not undergo apoptosis. This is consistent with a recent phase II trial with Selumetinib, an allosteric MEK inhibitor, which showed a 6% response rate in unselected melanoma patients. Retrospectively, 5 of 6 of the responders were found to harbor BRAFV600E mutations. We hypothesized that treatment of BRAF-mutated or NRAS-mutated melanomas with Selumetinib will induce clinical responses only in the subset of tumors in which the PI3K/AKT pathway is not activated. In this phase II trial, melanoma patients with either BRAF or NRAS mutation were stratified based on phospho-AKT (pAKT) expression (high vs. low), as measured by immunohistochemistry staining of pre-treatment tumor specimens. Patients were treated with Selumetinib 75 mg p.o. daily in 28-day cycles. We found that the incidence of high pAKT melanoma tumors was about 4 times higher than low pAKT tumors. None of the 10 patients in the high pAKT cohort responded, although 4 patients showed stable disease for 4 months. This cohort was closed to further accrual. In contrast, in the low pAKT group, 1 patient had a true partial response (PR) and 2 others had near PRs. One of these patients had to discontinue treatment due to toxicity; the other had his remaining tumor resected. This cohort was closed due to slow patient accrual. We used an exon capture, next-generation sequencing assay to define the mutational status of 230 cancer associated genes in pre-treatment tumors, derived from patients belonging to both cohorts. The assay detects point mutations, small indels and copy number alterations. Among the two low pAKT patients who were resistant to MEK inhibition, one had a mutation in MAP2K1 that encodes for a K57N mutation in helix A of MEK1. We speculate that this is an activating mutation, since a missense mutation in the amino acid just proximal (Q56P) was previously shown to be highly activating. The other non-responding patient in the low pAKT cohort had an activating mutation in EGFR. Both of these could drive increased activation of the MAPK pathway, thus explaining the resistance to the drug. We conclude that future trials with MEK inhibitors in melanoma should exclude patients with high pAKT tumors. The occurrence of complex genetic changes in melanoma requires studies to better stratify the patients according the prediction of response to MEK inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['Activating mutations in BRAF are found in 50% of melanomas and are associated with poor outcomes due to constitutive activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Treatment with BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi), such as vemurafenib, is effective but resistance can develop. A major mechanism of resistance involves feedback loop-mediated increased expression of the NRAS gene. Recently, we discovered the NRAS transcript is differentially spliced to give 5 novel isoforms (isos), which differ in their expression, cellular localization and downstream effects. We hypothesized that differential expression of one or more of the isos may contribute to the development of BRAFi resistance. We assessed iso-specific NRAS expression in 14 MM cell lines and melanocytes, and noted a curious expression profile of iso2', ' while undetectable in melanocytes and BRAFwt MM cells, its abundance was increased in BRAFmut cells, and it was the only NRAS iso highly overexpressed in 3 BRAFi resistant cell lines (p<0.01). Iso2 is characterized by an additional exon (exon 3b) compared to canonical NRAS iso1. To explore the possible role of NRAS iso2 in MM, BRAFmut A375 cells were engineered to overexpress NRAS isos 1, 2 and empty vector (EV). Iso2 overexpression led to significantly increased MM cell proliferation in vitro, and surprisingly also increased proliferation during treatment with BRAFi (p<0.001). In a xenograft model, athymic nude mice with A375 tumors stably overexpressing iso1, iso2 or EV were treated with oral BRAFi (50 mg/kg) or PBS for 21 days. Iso 2 overexpressing tumors did not respond to in vivo treatment with BRAFi and grew faster than their iso 1 overexpressing and EV counterparts, as quantified by IVIS imaging, which resulted in a significantly shortened survival of both BRAFi and PBS treated iso2 mice. In contrast, overexpression of canonical iso1 did not affect BRAFi sensitivity. Strikingly, shRNA-mediated knockdown of iso2 in BRAFi resistant cells resulted in decreased survival compared to iso1 or scramble knockdowns. Downstream signaling analysis utilizing immunoblots and confocal microscopy indicated a decrease in MAPK signaling and an increase in PI3K signaling in iso2 overexpressing cells compared to iso1 overexpressing cells. Protein complex immunoprecipitation of iso2 in COS-7 cells validated a binding affinity of NRAS iso2 to both PI3K and BRAF/RAF1. Since MAPK signaling is strongly reduced in iso2 expressing cells, this may suggest an allosteric inhibition mechanism, which prevents binding and activation of BRAF by canonical NRAS iso1.This study indicates for the first time that NRAS iso2 may play a role in BRAFi resistance by facilitating alternative survival signaling through the PI3K pathway in the presence of MAPK pathway inhibition. Targeting NRAS iso2 may be a beneficial treatment strategy in the prevention and management of BRAFi resistance in melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['NRAS, a proto-oncogene belonging to the RAS oncogene superfamily, is a intracellular signal cascade mediator, with intrinsic GTPase activity, functioning to initiate the MAPK cell signaling pathway. Among the RAS oncogene superfamily that is mutated in approximately 30% of all cancers, the NRAS mutation accounts for about 15% of RAS related human malignancies, particularly myeloid leukemias and cutaneous melanomas. Recently, a stable G-quadruplex (G4) was previously identified in the 5-untranslated region (UTR) of NRAS mRNA. This G4 functioned as a translational silencer, downregulating NRAS protein and leading to the hypothesis that a small nucleic acid clamp could be optimized to facilitate the formation of specifically this G4, decrease NRAS expression, and facilitate cell death in melanoma cells. In the present study, a set of clamps were designed and examined for their ability to facilitate the formation of a G4 in the 5-UTR sequence of NRAS. These clamps are comprised of ribonucleotides complementary to the RNA 5- and 3-regions flanking the G4-forming sequence held together by a small linker element. Based on binding studies consisting of electromobility shift assays and circular dichroism, an optimal flank length and linker length was chosen for cellular studies. Effects on cellular viability and NRAS expression are being examined in leukemia and melanoma cells, and RNA ChIP-Seq is being used to localize the intracellular activity of the clamps to the 5-UTR. These nucleic acid clamps offer a high degree of selectivity for G4s over linear RNA facilitated by the small linker region; moreover, the approach of complementary nucleotides, versus small molecule-mediated G4 stabilization, allows for specificity for just one G4 out of all of the intracellular structures. This approach not only provides a solid base for developing the clamp into a non-small molecule cancer therapy, but also opens a new window for modulating oncogenic gene expression at the transcriptional or translational levels. The current study, in particular, offers a novel approach to anti-NRAS-mediated therapies for the treatment of myeloid leukemias and cutaneous melanomas.']",

NRAS isoform 5 increases phosphorylation of downstream targets (AKT, MEK, and ERK). The structural report is unavailable for NRAS isoform 5. In addition, it was found in the current study that the NRAS isoform 5 does not have GTPase activity due to lack the canonical GTP binding region. Given the importance of this pathway in driving melanoma progression, we studied the structural details of this novel NRAS isoform 5 by two biophysical techniques, NMR and CD spectroscopy.The circular dichroism spectra of NRAS isoform 5 that was C-acetylated and N-amidated was measured using 11%, 14%, 21%, 45%, 56% and 85% trifluoroethanol (TFE) in a phosphate buffer. The secondary structural elements were induced at 14-15% TFE. There were no qualitative differences in the CD spectra between 56% and 85% TFE. Therefore 56% deuterated TFE was utilized in the NMR structural studies.Two dimensional (2D) homonuclear and heteronuclear experiments were acquired at 25C with Bruker Avance III HD 600 and 800 MHz NMR spectrometers (Campus Chemical Instrument Center NMR facility), each equipped with a triple resonance z axis gradient TXI cryoprobe for amino acid chemical shift assignments and structural determination of NRAS isoform 5. The NMR chemical shifts for the protons were assigned using traditional 2D TOCSY, COSY, and NOESY experiments. The 2D proton-carbon HSQC was utilized to facilitate the assignment of the alpha and side chain aliphatic protons. In the absence of TFE, there were no observable NOEs that could represent ordered secondary structures. Other than intra residue and short range sequential NOEs (i-j  2), only a weak medium range NOE was observed from the aromatic protons of Tyr 4 to the gamma proton of Val 7/8.The secondary structure of NRAS isoform 5 was determined via the same NMR techniques in 56% TFE. The secondary structure was defined by 69 sequential NOEs and 39 medium range NOEs. NOEs characteristic of helical structure were observed in the NOESY spectra. For example, NOEs were measured from H(alpha, i) to H(beta, i+3) for residues Tyr 4, Lys 5, and Leu 6. The tertiary fold was determined by 10 key long-range NOEs. The flexible C terminal is brought in close proximity to the N-terminal helix by 4 NOEs between Val 8/9 and Val 14, and 5 NOEs between Tyr 4 and Try 20 to form a helix-turn-coil structure in presence of TFE. In addition, the proton chemical shifts for the aromatic proton chemical shifts for the tyrosine aromatic ring became distinct.NRAS isoform 5 is highly flexible in aqueous solution, but forms a helix-turn-coil structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol as determined by NMR and CD spectroscopy.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Activating mutations of BRAF are highly prevalent in melanoma. However, multiple lines of evidence suggest that other pathways must also contribute to this disease. Activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway has been implicated in melanoma by mutations of NRAS and PTEN. Little direct information is known about the activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in melanoma, particularly in metastases. Methods', ' Proteins isolated from 99 frozen melanoma tumors were measured by reverse phase protein arrays (RRPA). A total of 53 proteins were assessed using validated antibodies. Activating mutations were assessed by mass spectroscopy-based genotyping. Activation of AKT (phospho-AKT) was compared to mutations and anatomic sites. Results', ' Samples from 75 regional metastases (LN or in-transit) and 24 distant metastases were analyzed. Technical replicates (same lysate) and biological replicates (same tumor, different lysates) demonstrated average Pearson correlation coefficients (r) of > 0.90, supporting the high technical quality of the analysis. A positive correlation was observed between levels of p-AKT and known AKT substrates p-GSK3 and p-TSC2 (p < 0.001 for both), and a negative correlation with PTEN (p < 0.01), supporting the maintenance of phosphorylation events during sample processing. Relative differences in p-AKT by RPPA were also confirmed by immunohistochemistry of representative tumors. Tumors with BRAF mutations had higher levels of p-AKT than tumors with NRAS mutations (p = 0.03). Indeed, tumors with NRAS mutations had p-AKT levels similar to tumors wild-type for BRAF and NRAS (p =0.73). Detailed analysis demonstrated that all tumors with elevated p-AKT had low PTEN expression. Similar results were seen in human melanoma cell lines. Analysis of distant metastases demonstrated that brain metastases had higher levels of p-AKT, p-GSK3, and p-TSC2, and lower levels of PTEN, compared to metastases to the lung or liver. Conclusions', ' AKT activation in melanoma correlates with PTEN expression, and does not correlate with NRAS mutation. Activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway may contribute to the aggressiveness of brain metastases. These findings have clinical implications for targeting this pathway, and demonstrate the feasibility and potential of RPPA analysis of signaling pathways in melanoma.']",

        "Background":"['Of the four molecular subtypes of melanoma (BRAF, NRAS, NF1, and triple WT), NRAS mutant tumors are notoriously more aggressive and challenging to treat. The frequent occurrence of NRAS mutationsin benign, congenital nevi suggests that these genetic alterations are early events in melanoma genesis. Since NRAS mutant nevi can remain indolent for years, or even a lifetime, secondary genetic events must be required to drive melanoma initiation. Ultraviolet (UV) light, a major risk factor for melanoma, is known to directly damage DNA and alter the skin microenvironment. Therefore, we hypothesized that the cell-extrinsic andintrinsic events triggered by UV exposure would cooperate with NrasQ61R mutations to drive melanoma formation in vivo. To test this hypothesis we employed a genetically engineered mouse model (i.e. TpN61R) that combines CRE-inducible expression of NrasQ61R with the loss of p16INK4a in melanocytes. Following neonatal CRE induction, we exposed TpN61R mice to a single, nonerythemic dose of UVB radiation and monitored them for the development of melanoma. Exposure to UVB radiation dramatically reduced the melanoma-free survival of TpN61R mice by 80% and increased tumor multiplicity (average 1.2 to 3.4 tumors/mouse); however, it had no impact on tumor growth rates, overall skin proliferation, immune infiltration, or vascularity. To test the respective roles of NrasQ61R and p16INK4a loss in UV-induced melanoma genesis, we generated mice with either melanocytic NrasQ61R expression or p16INK4a loss. Mice with p16INK4a loss alone did not develop tumors in the presence or absence of UV. By contrast, in UV treated TN61R mice, NrasQ61R was sufficient to initiate melanoma formation, albeit with a 66% longer latency than UV exposed TpN61R animals (9.14wks vs. 5.5wks). To determine if NrasQ61R mutations had to be present at the time of UV exposure to drive early melanoma formation, TpN61R mice were exposed to UV prior to CRE activation. Even when NrasQ61R expression was induced three days after UV exposure, melanoma formation was rapidly accelerated. Therefore, NRAS mutations do not need to be present at time of UV exposure to promote early melanoma formation. Genomic analyses comparing spontaneous and UV-induced TpN61R melanomas failed to uncover common secondary mutations that explain the exquisite cooperativity between NrasQ61R and UV light in driving melanoma formation. For this reason, we sought to identify UV-induced, cell-extrinsic factors that might facilitate the initiation of NrasQ61R mutant melanomas via cytokine profiling. Through these analyses we identified UV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines that could be therapeutically targeted to limit the initiation of NRAS-mutant melanomas. Together, this work explains why UV exposure is such a significant risk factor for melanoma and provides original mechanistic insight into how this deadly disease might be prevented.']",

        "Background":"['Metastatic melanoma is the major cause of skin cancer death, and the annual incidence of melanoma continues to increase. Despite the impressively high rates of response to BRAF inhibitors in patients with melanomas harboring BRAF mutations, most of these patients eventually relapse after developing resistance to the drug, due in part to secondary mutations in NRAS. Although NRAS mutation is the second most common genetic mutation in melanoma patients (after BRAF mutation), there is currently no treatment option that targets NRAS-mutated melanomas. New targeted therapies are urgently needed. Our previous reports have demonstrated the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cell lines carrying oncogenic KRAS mutations to apoptosis initiated by inhibition of protein kinase C delta (PKCd), suggesting that PKCd inhibitors might be effective in melanomas with primary or acquired NRAS mutations. PKCd is not required for normal mammalian development, making it a potential tumor-specific target. In this study, we investigated the effect of PKCd inhibition, and the efficacy of a new PKCd inhibitor BJE6-106 (B106), in melanoma. Inhibition of PKCd by B106 (at nano-molar concentrations), or by siRNA, inhibited the growth of multiple melanoma cell lines carrying NRAS mutations, and induced apoptosis mediated by terminal caspase activation. Analysis of the molecular mechanisms involved in this NRAS signaling-targeted approach demonstrated activation of the JNK pathway after PKCd inhibition, leading to the activation (phosphorylation) of H2AX, a histone H2A variant. Activation of H2AX was attenuated when JNK1/2 levels were repressed, indicating that H2AX activation is mediated by the JNK pathway in response to PKCd inhibition. Although the phosphorylation of H2AX has in the past been primarily known for its role in repair of DNA double strand breakage, more recent studies have proposed an active role for phospho-H2AX in the induction of apoptosis. Consistent with these reports, knockdown of H2AX prior to inhibition of PKCd mitigated the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis in NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines. To explore the potential activity of new PKCd inhibitors in inhibitor-resistant BRAF-mutant tumors, we derived melanoma cell lines harboring BRAF mutations that evolved resistance to a BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 (vemurafenib). B106 effectively induced cytotoxicity in these cells, suggesting the potential clinical application of targeting PKCd in patients who have relapsed following treatment with PLX4032. Taken together, our present study suggests that inhibition of PKCd causes caspase-dependent apoptosis in melanomas with NRAS mutations and in PLX4032-resistant BRAF mutant melanomas. This apoptosis is mediated via activation of the JNK-H2AX pathway, which involves a novel role for phospho-H2AX in the execution of apoptosis.']",

Patients enrolled on the trial had either unresectable, locally advanced Stage III or Stage IV melanoma. We analyzed patients tumor samples for 74 mutations in 13 genes using a custom iPlex (Sequenom). We have preliminarily analyzed 157 tumor samples from patients enrolled in this clinical trial. Analysis of the initial data set demonstrates that 62 samples (42%, 62/148, 95% CI 34%,50%) carried BRAF mutations - 60 samples with V600 and two samples having a BRAF V601 mutation. Thirty eight samples (26%, 38/148, 95% CI 19%,33%) were positive for NRAS mutations, with 33 with Q61, two G12 and three G13 mutations. With the exception of one tumor sample, the BRAF and NRAS mutations were negatively correlated with each other, consistent with prior observations. We also observed a number of rare mutations in our samples including one in AKT1, one in AKT3, four in CDK4, five in beta-catenin, two in GNAQ and three in KIT. The results of this study demonstrated no difference between the two treatment arms in OS and PFS and no association with treatment outcome and BRAF and NRAS mutations. Consequently, the treatment arms were collapsed, and we examined the relationship of BRAF and NRAS mutations with OS and PFS. Interestingly, our data demonstrated that the BRAF and NRAS mutations did not correlate with OS or PFS. This sample population is unique in that it provides a large data set of melanoma tumor samples, all of whom were entered on a clinical trial, unselected for pre-existing mutations. Using the Sequenom assay platform, we have identified a number of mutations in a subset of genes known to be involved in melanoma in patient tumor samples. In the future, these tumor samples will be informative as we continue to examine and identify additional genetic alterations in melanoma, providing information regarding the natural history and distribution of certain mutations. Future studies will use array comparative genomic hybridization to further investigate additional somatic mutations occurring in melanoma tumors and correlate these with clinical outcome, as well as provide insight into the pathogenesis of melanoma.

The melanomas were divided based on known mutually exclusive mutations (BRAF, NRAS and KIT) vs those without (WT). We compared RNA data between each group. KIT group had significantly higher expression of KIT than BRAF, NRAS and WT (p<0.01, FDR<0.01) and isoform 2 expression was higher than 1.

We evaluated the tumors for the primary type of genetic damage. The three signatures that appeared most divergent were CC>TT for UV, (G/A)C(G)>(G/A)T(G) for deamination, and G>T for oxidative damage. UV and deamination appeared inversely proportional, while oxidative damage appeared to be independent of those other two features. KIT and WT had a greater% of non UV high deamination tumoral environments. A fraction of these tumors also had very high oxidative signatures. We then compared 2 KIT subgroups UV vs non UV (absence of CC>TT mutations) for germline ethnicity differences.

In this study, we addressed possible roles of RASA1 in melanoma tumorigenesis. To determine RASA1 level in melanocytic lesions, immunohistochemical analysis of RASA1 on human melanoma tissue microarray (TMA) containing nevi (n=34), primary melanomas (n=63), lymph node metastasis (n=35), and distal metastasis (n=29) was performed. This analysis has shown the inverse correlation of RASA1 expression to melanoma progression. Functionally, ectopic expression of RASA1 mutant increased soft-agar colony formation and tumor growth while that of wild-type RASA1 decreased. shRNA-mediated knock down of RASA1 promoted soft-agar colony formation and invasion of melanocytes and melanoma cells with BRAF mutation as a consequence of the elevated Ras activity.Here, we established the functional significance of novel somatic missense mutations in RASA1 identified in our WGS study. Collectively, these data implicated that RASA1 inactivation by loss of expression and/or mutation may promote melanoma tumorigenesis.']",

Predominantly, hotspot mutations targeting BRAF (V600) or NRAS drive melanoma development and are associated with clinical benefit. Nonetheless, approximately 25-30% of melanomas do not present these hallmark events. This subgroup could benefit from in depth molecular analyses to inform the design of personalized therapeutic protocols. Here, we leveraged the largest collection to date (n = 1929) of mutational and protein profiles of metastatic melanoma patients, the Caris Molecular IntelligenceTM database, to investigate molecular and actionable drivers. This database is purposefully skewed towards BRAF and NRAS wild-type tumors, making it particularly suitable for our analysis. Methods', ' We analyzed immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next generation sequencing (NGS) data available for 906 patient samples for which BRAF and NRAS status was available from Caris. We then defined three main melanoma subtypes characterized by mutations in BRAFV600 (n = 253), NRAS (n = 257, 8 also present BRAFV600), and wild-type for both (2xWT, n = 404). Results', ' Within the 2xWT group, we could identify an enrichment for multiple oncogenic mutations impinging on MAPK signaling and including therapeutically actionable receptor tyrosine kinases. In details we found that 2xWT tumors are enriched for non-V600 BRAF mutations (13% of the 2xWT), KIT (9%), GNAQ (3%), GNA11 (5%), APC (7%), and MET (6%) which also shows elevated protein levels by IHC in 16% of the cases. Interestingly, these alterations are largely mutually exclusive with each other, strengthening the hypothesis of them acting as drivers. Different mutation subtypes show associations with divergent protein and mutation changes. Conclusions', ' Melanomapatients wild-type for BRAFV600 and NRAS hotspot mutations represent today a clinical challenge. This project oversampled for these tumors representing a particularly useful dataset to investigate secondary melanoma drivers.

        "Background":"['The pathogenic mutations in melanoma have largely been catalogued, but the order of their occurrence is not known. We identified 82 cases of melanocytic neoplasia with two or more histopathologically distinct precursor and descendent portions. These portions spanned several histopathologic stages including benign nevi, intermediate neoplasms such as dysplastic nevi, melanoma in situ, invasive melanoma, and metastatic melanoma. In total, 277 histopathogically distinct areas were microdissected and sequenced using a panel of several hundred cancer-genes at an average of 275-fold coverage. In all cases precursor lesions harbored mutations known to activate the MAPK pathway, most commonly affecting BRAF or NRAS, and thus these were considered initiating mutations. TERT promoter mutations were the earliest secondary mutations to occur, emerging in intermediate neoplasms and in situ melanomas. Bi-allelic CDKN2A mutations and/or deletions arose predominantly at the transition to invasive melanoma. TP53 and PTEN mutations occurred comparatively later in thicker primary melanomas. In the 12 cases in which matched primaries and metastases were sequenced, no pathogenic mutations were specifically associated with the transition to metastatic melanoma, suggesting that metastatic capability was already present in the primary tumors. Unequivocally benign neoplasms, which mostly consisted of conventional nevi, disproportionately harbored BRAFV600E mutations as the only apparent pathogenic alteration. Lesions that were histopathologically intermediate, such as dysplastic nevi, had two or more pathogenic mutations and were enriched for NRAS mutations. These findings provide genetic support for the existence of an intermediate stage of melanocytic neoplasia, resolving a long-standing controversy. We also found that melanomas with different initiating mutations evolve through distinct evolutionary trajectories linked to specific histopathologic precursors. A mutational signature of UV-radiation-induced DNA damage predominated in lesions from all histopathologic stages, implicating UV-radiation in both the initiation and progression of melanoma. The point mutation burden increased steadily from one progression stage to the next, stabilizing once melanomas became invasive. By contrast, copy number alterations only became prevalent at the transition to invasive melanoma. Melanomas evolve from benign lesions linearly, whereas, they show patterns of branched evolution when they evolve from intermediate lesions; this indicates that evolution may accelerate once a melanocytic neoplasm reaches an intermediate stage. In summary, our study outlines a framework of the genetic evolution of melanocytic neoplasms from precursor lesions and unveils the rate-limiting homeostatic factors that become disrupted as neoplasms progress from one stage to the next, as well as the pathogenic factors driving this evolution.']",

        "Background":"['One person dies from melanoma every hour worldwide. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2013 the 5-year survival rate for stage IV melanoma will remain unchanged at about 15%, even with new therapies. Autophagy (self-eating pathway) is a cellular recycling pathway that has been shown to play a role in normal physiological processes including nutrient and/or stress responses, antigen presentation, and aging. In melanoma, basal levels of autophagy appear to vary across tumor types and higher levels of autophagy are associated with increased hypoxia and poor clinical prognosis. Understanding the relationships between autophagy, melanoma and oncogene status will elucidate the molecular mechanisms/pathways contributing to this disease. Our preliminary research indicates that cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) cell lines differ in their response to chloroquine (CLQ), a classic inhibitor of autophagy. This study was designed to determine how differences in the autophagy pathway are influenced by oncogene status and whether induction of autophagy is oncogene dependent. Using LC3-II puncta and western blot quantification we evaluated the differential rate of autophagy by oncogene status using CMM cell lines. The rate of autophagy was characterized in 6 melanoma cell lines (e.g. SK-Mel 2, 19, 29, 94,103, and 147) and primary melanocytes to determine the extent to which these cell lines responded to CLQ and determined any decrease in cellular viability caused by treatment. Two common cutaneous melanoma activating mutations, BRAF and NRAS, appear to have opposing roles on the autophagy pathway in our metastatic cell lines. Our data indicate that the targeting of autophagy using CLQ in the BRAF oncogenic cell lines increases apoptosis and leads a significant decrease in viability. In addition, BRAF cell lines have higher basal protein expression of ATG12-ATG5 and LC3-II and a higher number of basal LC3-II punctae. Finally, the induction of autophagy through serum starvation results in differential basal LC3-II kinetics as measured by number of punctae between the BRAF and NRAS cell lines. These results indicate that BRAF is more dependent on autophagy for survival than NRAS mutant melanoma and that oncogene status dictates the sensitivity of melanoma cells to CLQ by altering autophagic flux, subsequently increasing apoptosis. Ongoing experiments include the evaluation of autophagy in patient samples to quantify expression of known autophagy markers as well an evaluation of LC3-II expression correlated with oncogene status. These findings are immediately translatable for patients that would benefit from CLQ co-therapy, which is already approved for clinical use.']",

Most of the currently studied mouse melanoma models are driven by RAS/RAF/MAPK activation via activating RAS or RAF mutations in combination with loss of INK4A/ARF or PTEN; therefore, BRAF/NRAS wild-type melanoma remains less well characterized and the overall survival of patients with metastatic BRAF/NRAS wild-type melanoma remains poor.In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that NEDD9 could synergize with the loss of PTEN and INK4A/ARF in melanoma tumorigenesis. This hypothesis is based on our observation of an inverse correlation between PTEN expression and levels of NEDD9 gene expression in human melanoma samples. NEDD9 (neural precursor derived, developmentally downregulated gene 9) was previously identified by us as a target of a recurrent focal amplification, associated with acquisition of metastatic potential in the RAS-Ink/Arf model. We have shown that NEDD9 is up-regulated in 3550% of metastatic melanomas and enhances proliferation and invasion. First, we demonstrated that NEDD9 cooperated with PTEN loss in Ink4a/Arf-/- melanocytes to enhance cell proliferation, anchorage independent growth, and invasion in vitro. Additionally, when melanocytes were injected into nude mice either subcutaneously or intravenously, NEDD9 overexpression facilitated increased tumor growth and lung seeding, respectively. Further analysis showed that NEDD9 expression correlated with increased phosphorylation of ERK, SFKs (Src family kinases), AKT2, and STAT3. Of these pathways we have demonstrated through the use of small molecule inhibitors that both ERK and AKT2 signaling are required for the enhanced anchorage independent growth observed in NEDD9 overexpressing melanocytes. In addition, we generated a mouse model based on loss of PTEN and INK4A/ARF with or without NEDD9 upregulation. To do this, we generated a tet-inducible NEDD9 allele that carries a doxycycline-responsive, melanocyte-targeted NEDD9. These mice were crossed with a strain containing floxed PTEN and INK4A/ARF in combination with a melanocyte-targeted CreERT2. The development of cutaneous and ocular melanomas in these mice was enhanced by NEDD9 induction.

        "Background":"['Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer with approximately 132,000 cases worldwide each year. Benign melanocytic nevi are nearly universal, and although progression of nevi to melanoma is very rare, 20-50% of melanoma appear to arise from a pre-existing nevus. UV exposure, particularly childhood sunburn, is believed to play an important role in the development of melanocytic nevi and melanoma, but the exact mechanism is unknown. Alterations in MAPK pathway genes, especially NRAS and BRAF, are common in both benign nevi and melanoma, but approximately 1/3 of melanomas do not have an identified driver mutation. Studying nevus initiation and progression prospectively in the human population is impractical due to the long latency to progression and repeated UV exposures Our laboratory has developed a hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) genetically engineered mouse model with “humanized” junctional distribution of melanocytes on an iDCT-GFP background with melanocyte-specific GFP expression, allowing melanocytic lesions to be tracked through percutaneous GFP imaging. Following a single relevant dose of UV modeling childhood sunburn, HGF iDCT-GFP develop discrete, small melanocytic lesions consistent with nevi. Most nevi remain stable over the lifetime of the mouse, but around 1 in 30 progress to melanoma usually starting at 6-12 months. The melanocytic lesions are histologically similar to human nevi and melanoma, label with melanocyte markers and tumors are transplantable into syngeneic mice. Melanomas that arise in the model are heterogeneous and include radial growth phase and vertical growth phase tumors and sometimes metastasize to liver and lung. Exome sequencing of 28 nevi and melanomas show that vertical growth phase melanomas have approximately 3x more mutations than radial growth phase melanomas or nevi. The increased number of mutations in vertical growth phase tumors is due to an increase in C>T transitions despite the lack of additional UV exposure. Interestingly, melanocytic nevi and melanomas with DNA repair pathway mutations average 3x more mutations than lesions without mutations in these pathways. Melanomas sometime contain mutations in hotspot locations from human melanomas, including GNAQ, but most do not have a previously identified dominant driver. Genes potentially involved in the initiation of melanocytic lesions or progression to aggressive melanomas and relevant to human melanoma have been identified and are being functionally tested using CRISPR to introduce point mutations or knock out genes and in vitro skin reconstitution assays. Identification of novel drivers and pathways involved in non-BRAF, non-NRAS melanoma has the potential to uncover biomarkers and new therapeutic targets to improve clinical outcomes for melanoma patients.']",

Another study has shown NRAS-mutant had a trend to superior outcomes compared with other cohorts in terms of response to therapy with anti-PD1 antibodies and progression-free survival2. Moreover, insight into the molecular evolution of melanoma was recently established3, wherein somatic mutations in oncogenes such as BRAF, NRAS, GNAQ, or GNA11 occur early during progression and additional mutations of TERT, CDKN2A, TP53, and PTEN are seen in late-stage disease. To better evaluate the relationship of these mutations to immunotherapy response, our institution has profiled 95 patients with melanoma with next-generation sequencing (NGS). Of the 95 patients profiled, the most common mutations identified were BRAF (38%), NRAS (21%), TP53 (18%), PTEN (14%), TERT (9%), and CDKN2A (8%). We are presently conducting a retrospective analysis of these selected oncogenes as they relate to clinical responses, and intend to report disease outcomes (duration of response, progression free survival, and overall survival) as they relate to checkpoint inhibition.']",

        "Background":"['Hyperactivation of the Ras/Raf/Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has been commonly observed in melanoma via frequent activating mutations in NRAS and BRAF. Novel mutations in other components of this pathway such as MEK1, MEK2, MAP3K5, and MAP3K9 have been reported recently by high-throughput sequencing efforts. In addition, Ras GTPase activating proteins (RasGAPs) that negatively regulate Ras, such as NF1 (neurofibromatosis type 1) and RASA2, have been shown to be mutated or suppressed in melanoma. However, importance of other RasGAPs in melanoma has not been addressed.To obtain a comprehensive view of melanoma genomes, we conducted whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 15 metastatic melanomas and matched normal PBMC genomes from 13 melanoma patients. All melanoma genomes from these 13 patients contained at least one mutation in genes of Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway (MAPK1, MAP3K1, MAP4K2, MAP3K14, NRAS, and BRAF). In addition, we identified two novel, clustered somatic missense mutations (p.Tyr472His and p.Leu481Phe) in RASA1 (RAS p21 protein activator 1, p120RasGAP). In this study, we addressed functional roles of RASA1 in melanoma tumorigenesis. The RNAi-mediated down-regulation of RASA1 promoted, while ectopic expression of wild type RASA1 decreased, anchorage-independent colony formation, tumor growth, and RAS activation. Interestingly, RASA1 Y472H mutant enhanced soft agar colony formation and tumor growth, while RASA1 L481F mutant lost its tumor suppressive activity. Mechanistically, RASA1 required RasGAP activity to suppress colony formation and showed higher activity toward R-Ras (related RAS viral (r-ras) oncogene homolog) isoform among the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. Moreover, RASA1 consistently suppressed Ral-A among Ras downstream effectors. Reduced R-Ras or Ral-A expression via siRNAs suppressed anchorage-independent growth induced by RASA1 loss. Interestingly, RASA1 expression was frequently down-regulated in metastatic melanoma samples (11.4% (4/35) of lymph node metastasis and 3.4% (1/29) of distal metastases) compared to primary melanomas (33.3% (21/63)) and dysplastic nevi (44.1% (15/34)). We also observed significantly shorter overall survival of melanoma patients with BRAF mutations when RASA1 mRNA expression is low, which may be explained by possible cooperative interactions between activation of BRAF/MAPK/ERK and RASA1/R-Ras/Ral-A pathways. Taken together, these data support that RASA1 is a novel melanoma tumor suppressor that is inactivated by suppressed expression or by mutation.']",

        "Background":"['Mutations in the B-raf oncogene constitutively activate the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, a key regulator of cell proliferation and survival. The most common BRAF mutation (V600E) occurs in approximately 70% of primary melanomas and 10% of colorectal cancers. Melanoma patients carrying the BRAF(V600) mutation respond with frequency of 80% to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib, while colon cancer patients respond at a rate of 5% only, indicative of intrinsic resistance. Moreover, clinical benefit is further limited by the rapid emergence of acquired resistance among vemurafenib responders. Combination therapy targeting both BRAF(V600E) and possible escape pathways appears to be a promising approach to reverse resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Here, we present the molecular characterization and in vitro chemosensitivity profiles of 20 melanoma and 20 human colorectal cancer cell lines. Four of the colon and 11 of the melanoma cell lines were established at Oncotest from patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX). Molecular profiles include the mutation status of BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS, and NRAS (exon sequencing) and protein levels for components of the MAPK, EGFR and PI3K/AKT pathways (Western blot analysis). Sensitivity profiles for inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, EGFR and PI3K were determined in vitro using a fluorescence-based survival and proliferation assay. Overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors was investigated by combination of vemurafenib with other inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway or inhibitors of potential escape pathways like EGFR, PI3K/AKT or c-MET and evaluated by combination index according to Chou-Talalay.In line with the clinical situation, the BRAF V600E substitution was found in 13/20 (65%) of the melanoma and only in 4/20 (20%) of the colon cancer cell lines. BRAF and NRAS mutations were mutually exclusive in melanoma cell lines and KRAS mutations did not occur at all. Among the colon cancer cell lines, in addition to the BRAF(v600E) mutation, alteration in KRAS (10/20 cell lines), PIK3CA (6/20) and NRAS (1/20) were detected. Chemosensitivity profiling revealed intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors for 3/13 (23%) BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines and for 3/4 (75%) BRAF(V600E) colon cancer cell lines. Reversal of the resistance of BRAF inhibitor-insensitive melanoma cell lines was recorded as synergism between vemurafenib and inhibitors of vasious kinases (c-MET, AKT, PI3K, MEK, or EGFR. A particularly strong synergistic interaction was found for vemurafenib and the c-MET inhibitor SU11274, irrespective of BRAF status. For colon cancer cell lines, the strongest synergisms were detected for the combinations of vemurafenib with inhibitors of c-MET, EGFR, PI3K, AKT and MEK.Displaying similar mutation and chemosensitivity profiles as melanomas and colon cancers in the clinic, the present cell line panels represent valuable tools to investigate the reversal of resistance towards BRAF inhibitors.']",

In humans, this pathway has also been associated with melanoma progression and its metastatic potential. The purpose of this study is the development of a UV-dependent melanoma mouse model that combines Xpc deficiency with the over-activation of the Edn3 pathway. Transgenic mice over-expressing Edn3 under the control of the keratin 5 promoter (K5-Edn3) and carrying a targeted mutation in Xpc were exposed to a single suberythemal neonatal dose of UV radiation. Immunostaining and histomorphology were used to confirm the melanocytic origin of primary skin tumors. Melanomas were only found in animals with the K5-Edn3 transgene. High penetrance was observed in Xpc null (67%, n=3) and Xpc heterozygous (67%, n=3) mice in comparison to Xpc wild type (33%, n=3) mice. RNA extracted from melanomas of Xpc null (n=2), Xpc heterozygous (n=1) and Xpc wild type (n=1) mice were screened for UV signature mutations in Hras, Kras and Nras. No mutations were found in any of these genes.

Preclinical data suggest that resistance is frequently driven by redundant growth factor signaling. For example, HGF has been reported to mediate resistance to BRAF inhibitors in V600E BRAF mutant melanoma. Furthermore, clinical data support these findings as circulating and tumor HGF levels have been shown to correlate with outcome in BRAF mutant melanoma patients treated with vemurafenib. In this study, we evaluated the ability of HGF / MET signaling to attenuate the effects of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in the context of V600E BRAF and NRAS mutant cell lines. Our data suggest that combined blockade of MET and MAPK pathway signaling may be required for a robust and durable clinical response in melanoma.Methods', ' To confirm the ability of HGF to rescue V600E BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines from the effects of vemurafenib, G361 and SKMEL5 cells were treated with vemurafenib alone or in combination with HGF. Time lapse imaging, viability assays and cell cycle analysis were used to measure treatment effects. Analogous experiments were performed with the selective MEK inhibitor PD0325901. Combinations of a potent and selective MET inhibitor (Compound A) with vemurafenib or PD0325901 were tested to evaluate their ability to attenuate the HGF-mediated resistance. To identify other cell lines rescued by HGF, thirteen V600E BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines were treated with a dose response matrix of vemurafenib and HGF. The ability of six additional growth factors to rescue cells from the effects of vemurafenib was also tested. Three NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines were also screened for HGF-mediated resistance to PD0325901.Results', ' Nine of thirteen V600E BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines were rescued from the effects of vemurafenib by co-treatment with HGF. Detailed analysis of G361 and SKMEL5 cells revealed that HGF was also capable of rescuing the cells from the effects of PD0325901. This HGF-mediated rescue was attenuated by treatment with combinations of vemurafenib + compound A or PD0325901 + compound A. Mechanistic cell cycle analysis of the HGF-mediated rescue of vemurafenib in G361 cells revealed an increase in proliferating cells and a reduction in growth arrested cells, whereas rescue of PD0325901 treatment occurred through a reduction in the percentage of dead or dying cells. Of the seven growth factors tested, HGF was the predominate growth factor capable of conferring resistance to vemurafenib. Furthermore, HGF rescued one of three NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines from the effects of PD0325901, highlighting the breadth of HGF-mediated resistance in melanoma cell lines.Conclusion', ' These findings demonstrate the potential role for HGF / MET signaling in mediating resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in melanoma, and support the clinical evaluation of MET kinase inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies to HGF in this setting.']",

Activating point mutations in the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K are detected at a low frequency in both BRAF and NRAS mutant melanomas, yet the principle mechanism of this cooperation remains elusive. Thus, using BRAFV600E/PIK3CAH1047R, NRASQ61H/PIK3CAH1047R, and PIK3CAE545K mutant melanoma cells derived from metastatic melanoma patients treated with pathway-targeted inhibitors, we examined the contribution of mutational activation of PIK3CA to melanoma maintenance and signaling and the consequential response of these PIK3CA mutant cells to -specific PI3K inhibition. Combined MEK and isoform-selective PI3K inhibition elicited more potent anti-proliferative effects and greater suppression of S-phase progression of the cell cycle compared to single-agent inhibition of either pathway. Analysis of signaling downstream of MEK or PI3K revealed that these pathways cooperated to regulate PIK3CA cell proliferation through mTORC1-mediated effects on ribosomal protein S6 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in an AKT-dependent manner. Despite the profound anti-proliferative and biochemical effects of -specific or PI3K-sparing class I PI3K inhibition in vitro, these agents elicited largely cytostatic effects on PIK3CA xenograft tumors. However, combined inhibition of PI3K-sparing class I PI3K and MEK did significantly cooperate to reduce tumor growth compared to the corresponding monotherapies.

This is particularly true for the understudied dark matter of the melanoma genome, i.e. cases that lack mutations in the three most commonly-mutated melanoma genes (BRAF, NRAS, NF1) and that display extensive mutational heterogeneity. Clearly a pressing need exists for transformative approaches to melanoma medicine. We have therefore broadened our traditional focus on melanoma in human patients to include canine melanoma as a model of human disease. Given canine melanoma's clinicopathological resemblance to human non-cutaneous triple-negative subtypes, study of this disease in each species may inform the other. Further, the accelerated clinical course of canine melanoma and flexibility in veterinary clinical trial design may allow for evaluation of novel treatment designs that would not be possible in human cancer trials. Thus, we have undertaken a first-in-dog genomic characterization study of canine melanomas from a cohort of 37 dogs to further explore the landscape of this comparative model. This analysis combines comprehensive genomics (whole genome, whole genome long-insert, RNA sequencing, and array comparative genomic hybridization) in 7 matched canine melanoma/normal tissues with targeted analysis in an additional 27 tumors and 3 cell lines. These canine tumors display striking patterns of mutation and subtype heterogeneity resembling that of their non-cutaneous human counterparts with the majority being BRAF, NRAS, and NF1 wild type and lacking recurrent single nucleotide variants.

Reported resistance mechanisms include acquisition of NRAS mutations, PDGFR or IGF1R activation, Cot amplification, or truncated BRAF upregulation. We report here that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), neuregulin-1 (NRG1), and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) cause robust resistance in vitro to BRAF or MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines. NRAS mutant lines were similarly resistant to MEK inhibition in the presence of these growth factors. By contrast other mitogenic factors such as PDGF, EGF, NGF, BDNF, MSP, MDK, GRO, and IGF1 did not maintain cell viability or growth. HGF, NRG1 and FGF2 prevented growth arrest and cell death and in some cell lines maintained cells in progressive growth. In addition, HGF and NRG1 could prevent growth arrest after dual treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Western analysis revealed that HGF and NRG1 reactivated Erk signaling and activated S6RP and AKT phosphorylation. Combined pharmacological inhibition mTor signaling and Akt signaling was required to fully block growth factor-mediated proliferation. In addition, small molecule Met inhibitors and an anti-HGF antibody blocked HGF-mediated resistance, while lapatinib and an anti-NRG1 antibody blocked NRG1-mediated resistance. While combined Akt and mTor inhibition potently inhibited cell line growth independent of BRAF or MEK inhibition, lapatinib and Met inhibitors had minimal effect on growth, suggesting potential for less adverse events with receptor inhibitors. In vitro co-culture experiments revealed that primary cells present in normal skin can cause resistance, and we have identified growth factors produced by these cells that contribute to resistance. We are analyzing receptor activation (Met and Erbb3) and FGF2 expression in wildtype, NRAS, and BRAF mutant primary melanoma samples. In future experiments we plan to test clinical samples from patients treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors, and we hypothesize that HGF, NRG1, and FGF2 signaling is elevated in patients with poor initial responses or relapse to BRAF or MEK inhibitors.']",

In its early stage, melanoma is easily cured, but the prognosis associated with metastatic malignant melanoma remains very poor and is one of the most treatment-refractory malignancies. We propose the application of Tumor necrosis factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) as a potential therapeutic for malignant melanoma. TRAIL induces apoptosis in a broad range of transformed human cells while showing minimal toxicity towards non-malignant cells. However, some cancers are resistant to TRAIL, specifically certain melanomas, caused by lack of TRAIL receptors or upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins. Here we analyze the naturally-occurring flavonoid quercetin as a potential cotreatment with TRAIL to overcome the intrinsic resistance of melanoma. Found in a wide variety of sources from onions and apples to red wine, quercetin is a good candidate for TRAIL cotreatment due to its ability to upregulate TRAIL receptors and downregulate antiapoptotic proteins. We have evaluated our cotreatment of TRAIL plus quercetin on four malignant melanoma cells lines which harbor mutations in the MAPK pathway, namely A375 and WM164 (BRAF mutant), SK-Mel-2 (NRAS mutant) and MeWo (BRAF WT, NRAS WT). Numerous cell-based assays were utilized including antiproliferative SRB assay, apoptotic AnnexinV/PI assay and western blot analysis probing for key proteins of the apoptotic cascade. Out of the four melanoma cell lines evaluated, A375 and SK-Mel-2 were sensitive to TRAIL dose-dependently; whereas, MeWo and WM164 were resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, even at the highest tested treatment concentration of 1g/ml. Quercetin, as a single agent, was able to induce apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in all four melanoma cell lines. To determine if the cotreatment, TRAIL plus quercetin, is able to sensitize melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we treated resistant cell lines, MeWo and WM164 with 250 ng/ml TRAIL plus sub-cytotoxic concentrations of quercetin, 25 and 50 M. Quercetin was able to sensitize both MeWo and WM164 to TRAIL-induced apoptosis marked by the fragmentation of PARP, a hallmark of apoptosis, and the activation of executioner caspases 3, 6 and 7. Specifically, quercetin was able to sensitize resistant melanomas to undergo TRAIL-induced apoptosis as evidenced by the cleavage of procaspase 8 to caspase 8, a marker for the initiation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Quercetin also promoted the TRAIL-mediated activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis marked by the release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria. These preliminary data demonstrate that quercetin is a good potential cotreatment for TRAIL; however, further research is needed to reveal the mechanism of quercetin sensitization of TRAIL-resistant melanomas and its role in TRAIL receptor and antiapoptotic protein expression.']",

TP53 muts were detected in 11% of pts with V600 muts, 19% of pts with NRAS muts and 29% of pts without V600 or NRAS muts (WT). NonV600 muts were detected in 1% of V600 pts, 4% of NRAS, and 15% of WT. TP53 muts were associated with increased age at diagnosis (p = 0.02) and primary tumor site (p = 0.0001), with increased frequency of head and neck tumor location. Pts with TP53 mut had longer overall survival (OS) from stage IV on univariate analysis (p = 0.04), and on multivariate analysis (p = 0.026) that included gender, stage, and LDH. Improved OS with TP53 mutation was not observed in pts with a V600 mut (p = 0.89), and TP53 mut was not associated with outcomes in V600 pts treated with approved BRAF inhibitors. NonV600 muts correlated with older age at diagnosis (p = 0.005), but no other pt demographic, tumor characteristic, or OS from stage IV. None of the NonV600 mut pts treated with approved BRAF inhibitors (n = 11; 1 with concurrent MEK inhibitor) had an objective response. Conclusions', ' TP53 muts were significantly associated with longer OS from stage IV in this large cohort of CM pts, and should be evaluated other melanoma patient cohorts.

In contrast to the majority of human tumors which harbour p53 mutations, melanomas preferentially have BRAF V600E or NRAS(Q61K) mutations accompanied by dysfunction of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which may help progression from nevi to invasive melanoma. Although ultraviolet radiation accelerates BRAF-driven melanomagenesis by targeting TP53 (Viros A. et al, Nature. 2014;511', '478-82), some evidences for an anomalous wt p53 response to radiation in melanomas are a dysfunctional pro-apoptotic DNA damage response which can be enhanced by radiation sensitizers like halogenated pyrimidines (Rieber M, Rieber MS.Cancer Biol Ther. 2008;7', '1561-6), and a report that p53 knockdown in melanoma cells resulted in decreased proliferation (Avery-Kiejda KA1, Bowden NA, Croft AJ, Scurr LL, Kairupan CF, Ashton KA, Talseth-Palmer BA, Rizos H, Zhang XD, Scott RJ, Hersey P.BMC Cancer. 2011;11', '203) .PURPOSE. Since activation of AMPK by AMP inhibits ATP-consuming metabolic pathways during metabolic stress which may cause autophagy, we investigated the possible role of melanoma p53 status in modulating response to AMPK activators and autophagy inhibitors, in physiological 5mM glucose. EXPERIMENTAL. Genetically-matched NRAS-mutant human melanoma cells with unequal p53 mutational status were exposed to different glucose levels in the presence of AMPK inducers including autophagy modulators. Formation of autophagic vesicles were quantitated by cytometric red/gree acridine orange fluorescence Apoptosis-associated PARP cleavage was studied by specific immune blotting. RESULTS. AMPK induction in response to AICAR was greater than that of metformin and was increased in mutant p53 cells, which also showed greater resistance to autophagy inhibition. Greater AMPK activation correlated with increased lysosomal acidification in mutant p53 cells. CONCLUSIONS.

The treatment of this chemoresistant disease in pediatric patients can be quite challenging, even with access to recently approved therapies for melanoma. Limited numbers have made it difficult to determine if the presentation and characteristics of pediatric metastatic melanoma are similar to the disease seen in adults.  Methods', '   In a retrospective chart review, we identified sixteen pediatric patients with metastatic melanoma who were referred to the Pediatric Oncology Branch. Molecular status of tumors was determined by CLIA certified tests. Patient overall survival data was collected while patients were treated with ongoing immunotherapy protocols or with treatment using approved agents.     Results', '   A total of 16 patients aged 2-21yo were evaluated from January 2009 to January 2014. Fifteen patients had cutaneous melanoma and one teen had mucosal melanoma. Eleven patients (68%) had a head and neck primary, including 8 patients with the scalp identified as the primary site. One teenager presented with widely metastatic disease from an unknown primary. In addition to common sites of metastases in lymph node, liver, and lung, pediatric patients also developed brain metastases (n=8 patients) and ocular metastases (n=1 patient). Five of the 12 tumors (42%) tested at diagnosis were found to harbor the BRAF V600E mutation. An NRAS mutation was identified in two melanomas. No ckit mutations were identified. Despite multiple treatment strategies, all patients experienced progressive or relapsed disease. The median survival of this cohort was 6 months following diagnosis of metastatic melanoma.   Conclusions', '   Metastatic melanoma in the pediatric population is an aggressive disease with widespread pattern of metastasis. Head and neck primaries had a higher incidence in this series than has been identified in pediatric or adult melanoma of all stages. It is unclear if this increase is due to delayed detection or differences in biology.  Further advances in pediatric melanoma will be aided by in-depth genomic analysis and collaborative study of these rare cases.']",

        "Background":"['INTRODUCTION', ' BRAF and NRAS oncogenic mutations occur in over half of all human melanomas. BRAF-mutant tumors are highly sensitive to small molecule inhibitors directed against the oncogenic BRAF protein. However, in tumors that lack the specific mutation, patients have few effective therapeutic options. To address the need for new therapies for patients with BRAF-wild-type (wt) melanoma, we hypothesized that the inhibition of the major nuclear export receptor CRM1 would result in nuclear accumulation of nuclear proteins, increase apoptosis and induce cell cycle arrest independent of BRAF mutational status. To test our hypothesis, we examined the effects of a novel CRM1 inhibitor on melanoma cell lines with various BRAF and NRAS mutational backgrounds. METHODS', ' We used human malignant melanoma cell lines with BRAF mutation (Sk-Mel-28, A375, Mel-624, UACC903, MalMe-3M), BRAF-wt (MeWo) and BRAF-wt and NRAS mutation (Hs940T) to assess the effects of CRM1 inhibition, BRAF inhibition (PLX4032) or MEK inhibition (U0126) using both mono- or combination therapy. MTT assays were used to evaluate the effects of treatment on cell proliferation. FACS analysis with annexin/PI staining was performed to assess effects on cell cycle and cell death. The Chou-Talalay method was used to assess synergistic drug combination effects. Treatment effects on cleaved caspase-3, PARP cleavage, P53, and FOXO3 were analyzed by western blot analysis. RESULTS', ' As mono therapy, CRM1 inhibition led to a significant decrease in cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest and an increase in apoptosis in both BRAF wt and mutant cell lines. The degree of inhibition and cell death achieved by CRM1 inhibition across all melanoma cell lines is comparable to the results achieved by BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 in BRAF mutant cell lines. Furthermore, the combination of CRM1 inhibition and BRAF inhibition results in a strongly synergistic combination against BRAF mutant cell lines with a statistically significant decrease in cell proliferation and increased apoptotic cell death. CONCLUSION', ' We found that relative to other cancer cell types, both BRAF-mutant and BRAF-wt melanoma cells are exquisitely sensitive to CRM1 inhibition. In addition, CRM1 inhibition significantly enhanced the effect of PLX4032 in BRAF-mutant cell lines, suggesting that the combination of these two drugs may address the emergence of acquired resistance to BRAF monotherapy. Based on these results, CRM1 inhibition warrants further investigation to determine its potential benefit in treating melanoma patients independent of BRAF mutation status.']",

We describe here two novel compounds that target mutant BRAF and wild-type CRAF. Our compounds inhibited the growth of melanoma cells that were resistant to BRAF-selective inhibitors. ERK pathway reactivation is responsible for resistance to BRAF targeted therapies in 60% of the patients and in 25% of patients resistance is driven by acquisition of mutations in NRAS. We show that our compounds inhibited the growth of melanoma cells that were resistant to BRAF-selective inhibitors due to pathway reactivation mediated by different mechanisms. We show that the drugs were active against patient derived xenografts (PDXs) from patients with acquired or intrinsic resistance to BRAF-selective inhibitors and in whose tumors resistance was associated with ERK pathway reactivation. Further, our compounds are active in a PDX from a patient whose tumor developed acquired resistance to a combination of a BRAF-selective plus a MEK inhibitor and associated with acquisition of an NRAS mutation. Thus, our panRAF inhibitors can inhibit melanomas with different mechanisms of acquired or intrinsic resistance to BRAF-selective and BRAF-selective/MEK inhibitor combinations, potentially providing first-line treatment for nave patients and second-line treatments for a range of relapsed patients.']",

Amplifications and deletions inferred by MPS coverage data were independently validated by a qPCR assay. We observed a decreasing frequency of CNV in clinically actionable genes from melanoma to NSCLC to colorectal cancer.Of 56 melanomas with genetic aberrations in BRAF, 31 showed co-occurring CNV in other genes, mainly affecting CDKN2A. Some tumors (5 cases each) revealed clustered deletions affecting either ABL1, NOTCH1, and RET or STK11, GNA11, and JAK3. 8.1% of the cases had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In the group of NRAS mutant tumors (n = 39), 26 showed co-occurring CNVs in other genes, such as CDKN2A and FGFR3, and 9 NRAS mutant cases were additionally mutated in BRAF. 19.1% had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In contrast to BRAF mutant tumors, we did not see any specific CNV clusters. In the group of BRAF/NRASwt tumors (n = 11), we observed 5 cases with co-amplification of KDR, KIT, PDGFRA and another 6 cases with KIT mutations. While co-amplified cases had many gene deletions, KIT mutated tumors harbored only very few genetic aberrations in other genes.Across both NSCLC data sets, we identified 14 cases with amplified EGFR (10 of them harboring co-occurring EGFR mutations) and detected 8 NSCLC with KRAS amplifications (of which 7 had co-occurring mutations of KRAS). KRAS mutated tumors displayed frequent amplifications in MYC (n = 10) and MDM2 (n = 5). Of the 22 BRAF mutant tumors, two harbored mutated KRAS. In contrast to melanoma, we observed no clustering of CNVs in BRAFmut NSCLCs. Within the group of KRAS/EGFR/BRAFwt tumors, we identified 15 cases harboring genetic aberrations in MET (n = 8 mutations, n = 7 amplifications).Compared to melanoma and NSCLC, the number of CNV in CRC was rather low. IGF2 amplifications were most prevalent (n = 13) followed by MYC (n = 9). Two cases showed amplified wild-type alleles of KRAS. Two KRAS mutant tumors showed concomitant amplification of NRAS and three cases harbored amplified EGFR.In conclusion we demonstrate that i) detection of CNVs by targeted MPS data obtained from FFPE material is feasible and ii) could be validated independently, iii) this approach enables detection of known CNV patterns, and iv) uncovers new CNV patterns in clinically actionable targets across cancers.']",

DMs are dermal tumors characterized by spindled melanocytes situated within abundant desomplastic stroma. These unusual histological features commonly lead to misdiagnosis. Currently, there are no known genetic drivers. A better understanding of the underlying biology of desmoplastic melanoma would provide biomarkers and therapeutic opportunities. Towards this goal, we performed low-coverage genome and high-coverage exome sequencing of 20 DMs in a discovery cohort, followed by targeted sequencing of 293 candidate genes on a validation cohort of 42 cases. Additionally, high-resolution aCGH was performed on samples from both cohorts. A high mutation burden (median 62 mutations/Mb) ranked desmoplastic melanoma among the most highly mutated cancers sequenced to date. Mutation patterns strongly indicate that UV-radiation is the dominant mutagen and implicate a superficially located cell of origin despite their predominantly intradermal presentation. Novel alterations included recurrent promoter mutations and amplification of NF-kappa B inhibitor epsilon, NFKBIE (IkB) in 14.5% of samples. The promoter mutations typically affect both alleles and occur over a highly conserved DNA region. The mutations are predicted to disrupt a canonical Ets Like Factor 1 (ELF1) binding site. In total, these data imply aberrant NF-kappa B signaling as a pathogenic feature of desmoplastic melanoma. Commonly mutated oncogenes in melanomas, in particular BRAF V600E and NRAS Q61K/R, were absent. Instead, other genetic alterations known to activate the MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades were identified in 73% of samples, affecting NF1, CBL, ERBB2, MAP2K1, MAP3K1, BRAF, EGFR, PTPN11, MET, RAC1, SOS2, NRAS, and PIK3CA. Rb and p53 pathway alterations occurred respectively in 71% and 66% of tumors, affecting RB1, FBXW7, CDK4, PPP6C, CCND1, CDKN2A, TP53, and MDM2. Finally, TERT promoter mutations or amplifications occurred in 90% of tumors. The consequences of the mutations on protein expression levels was confirmed by immunostaining for NF1, EGFR, Rb, CDK4, CCND1, p16, p53, and Mdm2. Collectively, many of these oncogenic mutations are potentially druggable. In conclusion, desmoplastic melanomas harbor distinct genetic alterations that explain their unique biology, and this study illuminates genetic biomarkers and nominates targets for therapeutic intervention.']",

Molecular targeted therapeutics against BRAF and MEK have shown marked efficacy for patients with metastatic melanoma. However these targeted therapies have a limited duration of response. Palbociclib is a highly selective inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) that has been shown to inhibit growth of malignant cell lines in vitro and in vivo by preventing the phosphorylation of Rb and stopping the progression G1/S of cell cycle. Cyclin D-CDK4/6-Rb axis has been shown to be dysregulated in 85-90% of melanomas and may represent a new therapeutic target. Our main goal in this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of palbociclib in a large panel of human melanoma cell lines to identify potential biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance. Material and Methods', ' We evaluated the response to palbociclib treatment in 48 melanoma cell lines. A comprehensive biomarker screen was performed using mutation and gene expression (Agilent) data. The mechanism of action of the drug was investigated by western blot (WB) analysis measuring phospho-Rb and senescence markers. Effects on the cell cycle and apoptosis were study by flow cytometry. Results', ' A marked differential response to palbociclib was observed across the melanoma cell lines with IC50s ranging from 28nM to over 1M. A subset (14/48) of cell lines were classified as sensitive at clinically achievable concentrations (IC50<150nM). BRAF and NRAS activating mutation did not correlate with sensitivity in vitro. Increased expression of genes correlating with cyclin D-CDK4/6 activation strongly predicted for palbociclib sensitivity. We also found that genomic and expression markers of activation of the hedgehog/smoothened (SHH) pathway strongly predicted for in vitro resistance to palbociclib. These markers included chromosomal amplification of SHH, and high baseline expression of SMO and GLI2. Protein analysis by WB showed a dramatic decrease in phospho-Rb protein only in sensitive cell lines and also it caused a decrease in FOXM1 protein, indicating palbociclib may partially act by inducing senescence in treated cells. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that palbociclib induces a strong G1/S arrest, but not significant apoptosis. Conclusion', ' Nearly 30% of the melanoma cell lines evaluated were found to be sensitive to palbociclib in vitro. Response to palbociclib did not correlate with BRAF and NRAS mutational status. A gene expression signature for CDK 4/6 activation successfully identified those cell lines most sensitive to palbociclib.

Appropriately, several drugs have been designed to inhibit BRAF, with a broad range of outcomes in clinical trials. Unfortunately, all patients, including those showing complete responses, develop resistance to single agent therapy. Our goal is to come up with effective drug combinations that would delay, or even prevent, the cancer from becoming resistant to treatment.We used a panel of 43 melanoma lines, comprising of 28 BRAF mutants, 12 NRAS mutants and 3 lines that were wild type for these two genes. Besides BRAF and NRAS, we have the mutational status of 65 other commonly mutated cancer genes for all the lines. We assembled a set of 25 drugs targeting a wide range of proteins, including PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, the apoptosis machinery, as well as some epigenetic modulators. The melanoma lines were treated with these drugs, either (i) alone or (ii) in combination with the B-RAF inhibitor vemurafenib or (iii) in combination with the MEK inhibitor Selumetinib, for 72 hrs over a nine point, 256-fold concentration range. Viability and apoptosis were measured using cell titer glo (Promega).The results from this pilot study are discussed here.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

        "Background":"['The management of melanoma is being revolutionized due to an improved understanding of oncogenic events in this disease. Many prevalent genetic alterations in this disease implicate activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways in melanoma. While the detection of activating BRAF, NRAS, and KIT mutations is relatively standardized, evaluation of PTEN, a tumor suppressor that inhibits the PI3K-AKT pathway, is challenging due to its regulation by epigenetic mechanisms. In order to understand the molecular correlates of PTEN expression in clinical specimens, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for PTEN in a CLIA-certified laboratory at the MD Anderson Cancer Center on a cohort of FFPE melanomas with mutational and proteomic data from frozen tissue from the same tumors. The expression of PTEN in the tumor tissue was compared to staining intensity in internal positive controls (i.e. endothelial cells), and was scored as Absent, Markedly Reduced, Mildly Reduced, or Normal/Increased. In a cohort of 93 tumors, Absent PTEN expression was observed in 21%, Markedly Reduced in 23%, Mildly Reduced in 36%, and Normal/Increased in 18%. PTEN expression was not evaluable in 1 tumor, and 2% of tumors showed clonality of PTEN expression in the tumors with distinct areas of Normal/Increased and Absent PTEN expression. Absent PTEN expression was detected in 38% of BRAF mutant, 0% of NRAS mutant, and 11% of Wild-type tumors. Quantitative proteomic data generated by reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis of the frozen tissue demonstrated that tumors with Absent PTEN by IHC had significantly lower PTEN (p<0.001), and higher levels of P-AKT Thr308 (p=0.004), P-AKT Ser473 (p=0.008) and P-P70S6K (p=0.01) than tumors with Reduced/Normal/Increased PTEN expression, consistent with increased activation of the downstream signaling by the PI3K-AKT pathway. In contrast, tumors with Markedly Reduced PTEN had lower levels of PTEN expression by RPPA than the Mildly Reduced and Normal/Increased PTEN tumors (p=0.046) but they did not exhibit significant differences in P-AKT or P-P70S6K. In light of these results, PTEN expression in subsequent samples was scored as Absent, Present, or Clonal. PTEN IHC of 323 distant metastases identified Absent PTEN expression in 18%, Clonal expression in 2%, and PTEN Present in 79% of resected stage IV melanomas. Among tumor sites with at least 15 samples available for analysis, the rate of Absent PTEN expression was relatively high in CNS (n=39; 28%) and intestinal metastases (n=76; 30%), but was lower in lung (n=147; 10%) and liver (n=18; 6%). Twenty six patients had tissue available from both CNS and extracranial metastases; the concordance rate of PTEN Absence in the paired specimens was 77%. These integrated analyses provide molecularly-defined parameters for the evaluation of PTEN expression in melanoma, and add to our understanding of its expression in this disease.']",

        "Background":"['Uveal (eye) melanoma is a highly aggressive cancer, in which almost half of patients develop distant metastases that are refractory to therapy. In particular, metastatic uveal melanoma has been clinically unresponsive to the immunotherapeutic agents that have shown success in skin tumors, making the need for novel therapeutic approaches to uveal melanoma all the more urgent. Unlike skin melanomas, which are driven by BRAF and NRAS mutations, uveal melanomas arise typically from mutations that result in constitutive activity of the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein, Gq, or its paralog G11. The prevalence of constitutively active Gq/11 in uveal melanoma suggests a dependence of these tumors on Gq/11 activity that could be exploited therapeutically. To address this hypothesis, we are using a potent, bioavailable small molecule that binds to and inhibits Gq/11 to target constitutively active Gq/11 in uveal melanoma cells. This inhibitor functions by sequestering wild type or constitutively active Gq/11 in an inactive state. We first used inositol phosphate accumulation assays and confirmed inhibition of both wildtype and constitutively active Gq/11 by the inhibitor in all uveal melanoma cells. We then assayed the affect of Gq/11 inhibition on overall viability of uveal melanoma cells, and found that uveal melanoma cells with mutant Gq/11 were highly sensitive to the small molecule; whereas, uveal melanoma cells with wildtype Gq/11 showed no loss of viability, even at 1000-fold higher concentrations of inhibitor. In Gq-mutant uveal melanoma cells, Gq/11 inhibition caused cell cycle arrest in G1, and dysregulation of several cell cycle regulatory pathways. Inhibitor treatment also caused Gq/11-driven uveal melanoma cells to become more differentiated, as indicated by increased pigmentation, elevated expression of melanin synthesis and melanosome markers, changes in cell morphology and changes in melanocytic versus melanoma gene programs. None of these phenotypic changes were seen in BRAF-driven uveal melanoma cells treated with the Gq/11 inhibitor, demonstrating that the effects of this inhibitor were exquisitely dependent on the constitutively active Gq/11 oncogene. These results establish that Gq/11 is a druggable target in uveal melanoma cells, and show that Gq/11-mutant uveal melanoma cells are exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by small molecule inhibitors. We are currently transitioning these studies to animal models to establish drug efficacy and toxicity and explore treatment and delivery options.']",

        "Background":"['Despite the prevalence of recurrent, high activating BRAF V600 mutations in 45% of tumors, cutaneous melanoma (CM) is a heterogeneous malignancy resulting from aberrant signaling in multiple pathways. It has been traditionally characterized by activation of the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, as well as cell cycle disruption. In recent years, whole-genome and exome sequencing studies have identified several new genes associated with melanomagenesis. However, a comprehensive understanding of concurrent, and mutually exclusive, mutations in tumors is currently lacking. Using a custom targeted capture of 108 genes previously implicated in melanoma pathogenesis, massively parallel sequencing was performed on 94 human melanoma cell lines, 67 patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and 5 cell lines made from PDX, all untreated. Samples were then clustered into groups based on deleterious mutations. 83% of samples had deleterious mutations in the MAPK signaling pathway, including 92 high activity BRAF (55%), 35 RAS codon 61 (21%), 7 with multiple mutations (e.g. low activity BRAF/RAS codons 12/13) (4%) and 10 NF1 (6%) mutated samples. Likely deleterious NF1 mutations were found in several BRAF or NRAS-mutated samples. PI3K pathway mutations were found in 10% of samples, predominantly associated with BRAF mutations. TP53 mutations were found in 24% of samples and were associated with all MAPK signaling mutations. Mutations in chromatin remodeling genes (ARID1A/1B, ARID2, TRRAP, and BAP1) were mutually exclusive with each other and primarily found in tumors with high activity BRAF or NRAS mutations. The majority of BRAF or RAS-mutated samples with a mutation in a chromatin remodeling gene lacked mutations in cell cycle, TP53, and PI3K signaling genes; however, 100% of deleterious, or likely deleterious, NF1-mutated samples with a chromatin remodeling gene mutation harbored additional mutations in cell cycle, TP53, and/or PI3K signaling genes. Of particular interest, five of the 10 NF1-mutated samples (50%) lacked BRAF, RAS, and MEK1/2 mutations but harbored likely deleterious mutations in MAP3K5 or MAP3K9, suggesting the potential involvement of the JNK signal transduction pathway in this particular cohort. Only 4% of samples did not have a deleterious mutation in any of the genes on the panel. These data reveal novel insights into the genetics of melanomas lacking a canonical BRAF V600 mutation. Functional assays are needed to confirm the biological relevance of likely deleterious mutations, which will further facilitate a more thorough classification of CM subsets.']",

Activation can be the result of largely mutually exclusive somatic mutations of KIT, NRAS, or more frequently, BRAF(V600E).

Currently, BRAF inhibitors are one of the most promising approaches to treat metastatic melanoma.Methods', ' In this study, we applied mass spectrometry-based SNP genotyping (Sequenom) to detect single nucleotide mutations in 33 cancer-related genes including BRAF, NRAS, KIT, CTNNB1, GNAS, and MET. PCR and extension primers for the multiplexed assay were designed with the Sequenom Assay Design software. Samples were processed as recommended by the manufacturer. Matrix chips were assayed on a Sequenom MassArray MALDI-TOF Mass Array system. Visual inspection and Sequenom Typer software were used to perform genotyping based on mass spectra. We compared two independent melanoma cohorts, one from Ireland (SVUH cohort; n=97) and the other from Belgium (Leuven cohort; n=60).Results', ' Intriguingly, patients from Ireland showed significant lower BRAFV600E mutation rates (19.0%) when compared to the mutation frequency seen with the Belgian cohort (43.3%) or with the mutation frequency reported by other studies on non-Irish populations (50-70%). In addition, BRAFV600K mutation is rare in the SVUH cohort (1.0%) compared with the Leuven cohort (6.7%). Mutations in BRAFV600M and V600R were <2% in both groups. Although the number of NRASQ61 mutant cases was slightly higher among the Irish melanoma patients compared with Belgium patients (20.6% and 13.3%, respectively), this does not fully account for the difference in BRAFV600E mutation rate. In contrast, many BRAFV600 WT patients in the SVUH cohort carried significantly increased mutation rates in MET (11.4%) compared to the Leuven cohort (0%) and reported elsewhere (2%). c-MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that activates multiple signal transduction pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, WNT, and Notch. MET inhibitors that are currently in clinical trials include cabozantinib and foretinib and might be a valuable alternative treatment strategy for patients exhibiting this mutation. Mutation rates of the other examined genes were always <5% and did not significantly differ between the groups.Conclusion', ' Our observation of reduced BRAFV600E mutation rates in Irish patients will directly impact future treatment strategies for these patients.

        "Background":"['Melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer and FDA-approved therapies such as vemurafenib and ipilimumab are associated with short-term responses and/or severe toxicities for patients. Recent favorable clinical data with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib (PD991) in ER+ breast cancer has rekindled an interest in targeting cell cycle progression to stop aberrant cell growth. Thus, we set out to analyze the potential use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in melanoma. Due to the inability of CDK4/6 inhibitors to induce apoptosis as a single agent, we explored viable combinatorial strategies that will trigger both pro-senescent and pro-apoptotic pathways that may lead to an effective treatment modality for melanoma patients. Here, we demonstrate the benefit of combining a MEK inhibitor, trametinib (GSK212) with PD991 both in vitro and in vivo. We did not observe any enhanced effects of combining both GSK212 and PD991 in cells that are wild-type for BRAF and NRAS or an RB1-null BRAF mutant line. However, B-RAF and N-RAS mutant cells exhibited an enhanced response to the combinatorial agents as compared to single agents. Furthermore, we observed a dramatic increase in apoptosis in cell lines that are sensitive to combined GSK212 and PD991 treatment. Expression of Inhibitor-of-Apoptosis (IAP) protein, survivin, was associated with response. Finally, because it is important to understand how resistance develops, we have validated a novel E2F reporter system in vivo to quantitatively and temporally measure the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors and possible re-activation of the pathway during acquired drug resistance.']",

        "Background":"['Most of melanoma harbour mutations leading to the constitutive activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (i.e', ' activating mutations of BRAF, NRAS, c-KIT). Addiction of melanoma to the MAPK pathways led to the development of inhibitors targeting either mutant BRAF, such as Vemurafenib (PLX4032), or MEK. Melanoma treatment recently met a breakthrough with the clinical evaluation of Vemurafenib that demonstrated an unprecedented 80% response rate among patients with BRAF V600E melanomas treated with Vemurafenib, but rapidly limited by drug resistance, which still requires to be elucidated.The MAPK pathway regulates the expression of many genes which can mediate therapeutic response but also resistance, such as RhoGTPases. We analysed the mRNA expression of the RhoGTPases in two BRAF mutated melanoma cell lines, WM266-4 and A375, in response to inhibition of the MAPK pathway by PLX4032. We observed that the mRNA of RhoB was increased by PLX4032 treatment. This result was confirmed in many other BRAF mutated melanoma cell lines by inhibition of the MAPK pathway with BRAF inhibitors (PLX4032 or SB-590885) as well as MEK inhibitors (AZD6244 or AS703026). MEK inhibitors (AZD6244 or AS703026) upregulate RhoB in BRAF wild-type melanoma cells harbouring N-Ras, K-Ras or c-KIT mutation suggesting that inhibiting MAPK pathway is critical for RhoB expression modulation. It is noteworthy that this modulation is cell type dependent, while it was not found in BRAF mutated non-melanoma cells as colon carcinoma cells (Colo205 and RKO).To investigate the role of RhoB induction in cellular responses to BRAF and MEK inhibitors, the RhoB induction was suppressed using RNA interference. The cells treated with siRNA targeting RhoB, WM266-4 and A375 cells, were more sensitive to PLX4032 and AZD6244. Moreover the blockade of RhoB induction led to a significant increase of PLX4032-induced apoptosis as shown by the increase of the subG1 population and PARP cleavage.Our findings show that RhoB upregulation is involved in PLX4032 response and both inhibitions of MAPK pathway and RhoB expression trigger cell death and should prompt a search for agents. Indeed co-targeting MAPK and RhoB pathways, could lead to a synthetic lethality and prevent resistance to either BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Ongoing work focuses on confirming this role in tumour-xenografted mouse models.']",

Retrospective studies suggest inferior outcomes for Ipi in atypical cohorts of melanoma (uveal, mucosal) compared to unselected populations. Acral melanoma (AM) is an uncommon subtype of melanoma with a poor prognosis. The clinical activity of Ipi has not been well defined in advanced AM.  Methods', '  To assess the activity of Ipi in this cohort, we retrospectively reviewed the demographics, treatment history, and clinical outcomes for all patients (pts) with AM treated with Ipi from two centers between February 2006 and June 2013.  Using Cox proportional hazards models, we assessed for factors that correlated with OS.  Results', '  Of 35 patients with advanced AM who received Ipi, 28 were Caucasian, 6 were black, and 1 was Hispanic. Primary tumors arose on the volar surfaces in 28 and subungual sites in 7. Of 31 genotyped patients, 3 had mutations in BRAFV600E, 2 in NRAS, and 4 in CKIT. Stage IVc disease was present in 19 pts, IVb in 6, IVa in 5, and III in 5; 45% had elevated LDH. Median number of prior therapies was 1 (range 0-3) including targeted agents in 6 pts and immune-based therapies in 5. The median number of Ipi doses received was 4 (33 pts with 3mg/kg dosing and 2 with 10mg/kg). Best response by immune-related response criteria (irRC) was complete response in 1 pt, partial response in 3, and stable disease (SD) in 5 for an objective response rate (ORR) of 11.4% and clinical benefit (ORR + SD) at 24 weeks of 25.7%. Median progression-free survival (PFS) from initiation of Ipi was 2.6 months (mo) (95% CI 2.2-3 mo); median OS was 16.7 mo (95% CI 11-22.5 mo). Normal LDH and absolute lymphocyte count 1000 at 7 weeks predicted longer OS; metastatic stage, and timing or site of initial recurrence did not influence OS. Toxicities were similar to previous Ipi trials; 16 pts had an immune-related adverse event (irAE) and 7 pts had grade 3 irAEs (colitis in 2, hypophysitis in 3, and hepatitis and dermatitis in 1 each).  Conclusions', '  Ipi induced clinical responses in pts with AM with similar ORR, PFS, and OS compared to unselected populations.

        "Background":"['Background', ' In melanoma, the RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR (AKT) signaling pathways are constitutively activated and have key functions in tumor progression. In our previous studies, combination of the nonselective RAF inhibitor sorafenib with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus significantly potentiated growth inhibition and led to an approximately 2-fold increase of apoptosis of melanoma cells in monolayer culture compared with sorafenib monotreatment (p<0.05). Moreover, sorafenib in combination with sirolimus completely suppressed invasive melanoma growth in organotypic culture. Methods', ' To investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the antitumoral action of this drug combination we analyzed the gene expression profile of melanoma cells in response to sorafenib or/and sirolimus. Results', ' Data analysis showed a series of genes (p8, ATF4/3, CHOP, TRB3) that were upregulated after treatment with sorafenib and sirolimus and have been proposed to be responsible for the execution of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis. Using real-time quantitative PCR, we confirmed that sorafenib and sirolimus upregulate p8, ATF4/3, CHOP and TRB3 mRNA levels in melanoma cells. Likewise, western blot analysis showed that sorafenib and sirolimus increase p8 and CHOP protein levels. Furthermore, the farnesyl transferase inhibitor lonafarnib inhibiting mTOR signaling also augmented sorafenib-induced apoptosis and upregulation of the ER stress-related transcription factor p8. Of note, growth inhibitory effects and upregulation of ER stress-related genes by sorafenib and sirolimus or lonafarnib did not depend on BRAF or NRAS mutation status. By contrast, the BRAFV600E kinase inhibitor PLX4032 potently inhibited growth and upregulated the ER stress-related transcription factor p8 preferentially in BRAFV600E melanoma cells.

Melanoma has been the tumor of choice for the evaluation of a wide variety of therapeutic approaches that rely on stimulation of the immune system to combat cancer. The striking responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors noted in some melanoma patients have now been observed in several other malignancies, including renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. These findings are very encouraging, however the specific mechanisms of response and reasons why only a subset of patients respond to therapy are not known. The extraordinary potential of immune therapies in cancer suggests that human-relevant mouse models of cancer are required to understand mechanisms of response and to optimize therapy so that a larger proportion of patients respond.We have generated and evaluated a series of genetically engineered mouse models driven by alterations in Braf, Pten, Cdkn2a, beta catenin, p53, and Nras that reflect the genetic diversity of the vast majority of human melanoma. We have backcrossed 6 of these models to C57Bl/6, generated tumors, and isolated a series of over 20 congenic mouse melanoma cell lines. Several independent lines have been isolated for each melanoma genotype generated. Injection of these lines into C57Bl/6J mice results in reproducible tumor formation in the absence of co-injection of Matrigel. We are in the process of characterizing the tumor microenvironment in each of the models using flow cytometry and a novel quantitative imaging approach of histological sections, which produces flow cytometry-like data, but retains spatial and morphologic information that can be utilized to characterize much smaller tumors. This series of congenic lines represents an ideal set of models for the study of cancer immunology and responses to immune therapies.']",
