        "Background":"['Knowledge on the regulatory pathways involved in melanoma development and progression has advanced significantly in recent years. It is now recognized that multiple signaling pathways that affect motility, growth control, invasion, metabolism, cytokine release and the ability to escape the immune response, regulate melanoma development. Silencing of SOCS-1 protein, a negative regulator of Jak/Stat pathway, leads to partial reversion of the tumorigenic phenotype of B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells. SOCS-1 silencing with shRNAi inhibits in vitro growth by cell cycle regulation with S phase arrest and increased size of cells and nuclei. It also inhibited tumor cell migration and invasion. Down-regulation of SOCS-1 decreased the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (mainly the phosphorylated-R), Ins-R, and fibroblast growth factor receptors. Based on the results of SOCS-1 silencing, the present work aims at analyzing the expression of proteins relevant to tumor development, searching for signaling pathways related with SOCS-1. A protein microarray analysis of murine melanoma cells silenced for SOCS-1 by shRNAi SOCS-1 lentivirus transduction was undertaken using as controls, cells transduced with the empty vector. Among the 614 differentially expressed genes some cytokine/growth factor receptors were down regulated, e.g. c-kit, met and EphA3. Western blotting of B16 shR-SOCS-1 cell extracts showed a significant decrease in the expression of these receptors, indicating that SOCS-1 positively regulates the MAPK pathways in these cells. We analyzed the main MAPK pathways that were up regulated in melanoma and observed a decrease in the phosphorylation of mediators of ERK1/2 and p38 pathways and of STAT3 (S727). These results demonstrate that SOCS-1 can play an important role in tumor development and progression up regulating a number of growth factor receptors in murine melanoma cells. Interestingly, p-CREB (S133) was up regulated in the SOCS-1-deficient B16F10-Nex2 cells. In vivo experiments showed that using a prophylactic protocol, the subcutaneous immunization of syngeneic mice with B16 shR-SOCS-1 viable cells, rendered a protective effect against subcutaneously grafted and metastatic murine melanoma, with significant reduction in tumor growth and metastates in the lungs. A flow cytometry assay showed decreased expression of PD-L1 at the surface of B16 shR-SOCS-1 cells. This might explain the protective effect of subcutaneous immunization with these cells, rather than with wild-type B16F10-Nex2 cells that overexpress PD-L1, which negatively regulates T-cell immune response. Down regulation of PD-L1 is compatible with inactive ERK. The present results show the important role of SOCS-1 in murine melanoma stimulating cell growth and migration, allowing for the invasive phenotype.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' The therapy of metastatic melanoma (MM) was radically changed by the introduction of BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi). Even if highly effective in the short term, patients invariably develop resistance in the long term. For this reason other inhibitors as well as alternative or complementary therapeutic strategies are being tested in these patients. Among the immune checkpoint targets of clinical importance is PD-1, which is expressed by T cells and which binds to the PD-L1 ligand, which may be expressed by melanoma cells. We and others showed that PD-L1 is an independent negative prognostic marker for patients with MM.Methods', ' BRAFi-/MEKi-resistant melanoma cell lines were generated by treating cells with increasing concentrations of BRAFi or MEKi. Resistance, viability and aggressiveness were analyzed by MTT, migration and wound healing assays. Results were confirmed using xenograft models. Resistant cell lines were compared using RNAseq to identify enriched genetic pathways involved in the resistance. Luciferase reporter assay analysis was used to study the direct interactions between the PD-L1 and miR-17-5p.Results', ' By comparing responses to BRAFi in PD-L1+ and PD-L1- variants of the A375 cell line, we found that PD-L1 expression conferred resistance to BRAFi or MEKi. Conversely, silencing of the molecule restored sensitivity to these drugs. Resistant melanoma cell lines acquired PD-L1 expression and were characterized by a specific genetic profile, with the modulation of genes controlling cell movement and immune responses. Consistently, these cells showed a more aggressive behavior both in vitro and in xenograft models. PD-L1 silencing in resistant cells decreased invasive properties and restored expression of HLA-II molecules.PD-L1 up-regulation was only partly dependent on the paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway, which characterized resistant cells. In addition, we found that resistance to BRAFi and MEKi down-modulated miR-17-5p, which showed an inverse correlation with PD-L1. Transfection of miR-17-5p into BRAFi-resistant cell lines induced the down-modulation of PD-L1, reduced the aggressive behavior of the cells and partially restored sensitivity to BRAFi. Finally, in the plasma of patients with MM, miR-17-5p was inversely correlated with expression of PD-L1 in the tumor tissue.Conclusions', ' These data demonstrate a direct link between expression of PD-L1 and resistance to BRAFi, as well as to a more aggressive behavior of melanoma cells. Furthermore, we define a novel post-transcriptional circuit responsible for PD-L1 up-regulation, based on a direct interaction between miR-17-5p and PD-L1 mRNA. Lastly, miR-17-5p plasmatic levels show an inverse correlation with PD-L1 expression by tumor cells, suggesting that they may be useful in monitoring disease outcome and drug sensitivity.']",

        "Background":"['While PD-1/L1 axis-targeted therapies have shown promising clinical responses, their use in combination therapies is associated with both benefits and safety concerns. Response rates for single-agent anti-PD-1 therapies are significantly higher in biomarker positive patients, therefore there is a need to utilize predictive diagnostics to enhance benefit-risk profiles and guide treatment decisions. To address this, we developed a novel quantitative multiplexed immunohistochemistry assay that provides objective quantitation of PD-L1 positive cells, but more importantly assesses interactions with immune cells (PD-1+ or CD8+) in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) clinical specimens. The clinical validity of this assay was verified in a small series of melanoma patients treated with anti-PD1 targeted therapies/agents.FFPE melanoma tissues from patients who received anti-PD-1 therapy were fluorescently stained with a combination of anti-PD-1, PD-L1, and S100 antibodies plus DAPI or a combination of anti-CD8, PD-L1, and S100 antibodies plus DAPI. Each slide was then imaged on Vectra platform and the frequencies of biomarker positive cells (PD-L1, PD-1, and CD8) and their interaction scores were objectively evaluated using proprietary Automated Quantitative Analysis (AQUA) algorithms. Analytical sensitivity, precision, and accuracy were established using standardized PD-L1 and PD-1 tissue control arrays composed of cell lines and lymphoid organs, while range of biomarker expression was verified on archived melanoma clinical specimens (n = 30), including samples taken from melanoma patients prior to anti-PD-1 therapies (n = 21).Frequencies of PD-L1 positive cells could be accurately quantified within 1% to 100% range in predefined control cell line mixtures. PD-L1 and PD-1 measurements were highly reproducible (R2 = 0.98 and 0.97, respectively). A broad range of PD-L1 and PD-1 expression and interaction scores were observed in archival clinical specimens (n = 53). In a cohort of 21 advanced melanoma patients treated with nivolumab (n = 5) or pembrolizumab (n = 16), the PD-1/L1 interaction score was found to reliably distinguish responders from non-responders (p = 0.03) while PD-L1 alone (p = 0.15) or CD-8 alone (p = 0.23) did not. Additionally, patients exhibiting higher PD-1/L1 interaction scores had superior response rates (78% vs. 17%, p = 0.03). Responders experienced significantly longer median progression-free survival (177 vs. 85 days, p = 0.014), and fewer deaths (22% vs 58%) compared with patients having lower PD-1/L1 interaction scores.In terms of diagnostic utility, the PD-1/L1 multiplex test showed superior predictive power (78% Positive Predictive Value, 83% Negative Predictive Value) compared with PD-L1 expression alone.

The responsiveness of a RAS-driven melanoma model to mDX400 is consistent with earlier reports about the clinical benefit of patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma to Ipilimumab, and the lack of PD-L1 expression and immune infiltrates of PTEN-deficient melanomas.

        "Background":"['Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) is a member of the CD28 family of receptors and plays a role in cellular immune response. It is expressed on activated T-cells and B-cells and binds to two ligands, Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Programmed Death Ligand 2 (PD-L2). PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell functions through interactions with its primary ligand PD-L1, which is variably expressed by a variety of tumors, including melanoma, glioblastoma, and carcinomas of the lung, breast, colon, ovary, and renal cells. Many tumor cells express PD-L1 and as a result, the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 has been demonstrated to be an important target for therapeutic intervention. Anti-PD-1 therapeutics such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab have demonstrated clinical activity in melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and other types of cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate 7 commercially available anti-PD-L1 antibodies in human tissue and cell lines. Antibodies included 1 mouse monoclonal (clone 29E.2a3), 2 rabbit monoclonals (EPR1161(2) and E1L3N), 3 rabbit polyclonals, and 1 goat polyclonal from 6 manufacturers. An initial screen in human tonsil was performed to ensure appropriate sensitivity and specificity in staining of the crypt epithelium. Only 2 antibodies yielded staining that matched the expected specificity and were selected for further evaluation', ' rabbit clone EPR1161(2) from Abcam and rabbit clone E1L3N from Cell Signaling. Antibody specificity was evaluated in a positive cell line (MDA-MB-231) and negative cell line (MCF-7). Both antibodies demonstrated appropriate specificity in these cell lines. Antibody sensitivity was evaluated in a variety of human tumor tissues provided by Mosaic Laboratories tissue bank. PD-L1 localization was expected to be membranous and cytoplasmic in tonsil crypt epithelium, inflammatory cells and tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry with both antibodies demonstrated staining in tumor cells, lymphocytes and macrophages. Immunohistochemistry with clone E1L3N often demonstrated stronger staining in a greater percentage of cancer cells than EPR1161(2). Of interest, clone E1L3N demonstrated specific staining of some peripheral nerve fibers that was not observed with clone EPR1161(2). In conclusion, 2 commercially available antibodies, rabbit clone EPR1161(2) from Abcam and rabbit clone E1L3N from Cell Signaling are appropriate for immunohistochemistry, of which rabbit clone E1L3N demonstrates greater sensitivity in tumor tissue.']",

Our objective was to identify other cancers that show increased PD-L1 expression in order to target them for treatment with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab (MK-3475). A collaboration between Merck and the Moffitt Cancer Center was previously established to build a molecular profiling database of >16,000 primary and >3000 metastatic tumors representing 25 different cancers. All tumor samples were profiled on a standardized platform (Affymetrix-Merck Custom GeneChip). For each profiled sample, the PD-L1 cutpoint determined for positivity was defined as the Affymetrix pan-cancer 75th percentile of PD-L1 probes mean. This cutpoint was projected for each specific tumor type and percentages of tumors with PD-L1 above the cutpoint were determined. Cancer indications were rank ordered from highest to lowest percentage of PD-L1 positivity. The analysis identified NSCLC (42% PD-L1+) and melanoma (41% PD-L1+) among the top indications for which single-agent clinical activity of anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapies has been reported. At the bottom of the rankings were prostate cancer (14% PD-L1+) and pancreatic cancer (4% PD-L1+), indications for which limited clinical activity had been reported. This observation confirmed that ranking tumor types by PD-L1 expression across the profiling database could be used to identify other cancers that may respond to anti-PD-1 therapy. Of interest were the tumor types with high PD-L1 expression for which no clinical studies evaluating an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agent had been initiated. Among the indications with high PD-L1 expression were head and neck (59% PD-L1+), urothelial (42% PD-L1+), and triple-negative (TN) breast (29% PD-L1+) cancer; these indications were chosen for evaluation with pembrolizumab in the KEYNOTE-012 study. By accessing cohorts of Asian patients with lung, liver, and gastric cancer and use of similar gene expression microarray profiling, we were able to extrapolate the PD-L1 rankings for these cancers; this resulted in the addition of gastric cancer to KEYNOTE-012. Recently, clinical results from KEYNOTE-012 have shown strong clinical activity for pembrolizumab in all 4 selected indications', ' head and neck, 20% ORR; urothelial, 21% ORR; TN breast, 18% ORR; and gastric, 31% ORR. The strategy of using a tumor profiling gene expression database for evaluation of PD-L1 expression enabled rapid expansion of pembrolizumab development into indications for which the likelihood of demonstrating clinical activity was high. In turn, this should help accelerate the approval of pembrolizumab for additional indications and, ultimately, provide help to patients suffering from cancer.']",

Our group recently reported that the pharmacological or genetic abrogation of a single HDAC, HDAC6, modulates the expression of immuno-regulatory proteins, including PD-L1, PD-L2, MHC class I, B7-H4 and TRAIL-R1. We primarily focused in PD-L1, which is an important negative regulator of T-cell function and often over-expressed in cancer cells. In a mechanistic point of view, we have found that the pharmacological inhibition and genetic abrogation of HDAC6 inactivates the STAT3 pathway, impairs the nuclear translocation and the recruitment of STAT3 to the PD-L1 promoter and subsequently down-regulates the expression of PD-L1. Moreover, the in vivo abrogation of HDAC6 reduces tumor growth in melanoma models, effect that is enhanced in the presence of the immune check-point blocking antibodies anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4.

        "Background":"['Lung cancer remains a major cause of cancer mortality. Malignant lesions are normally endogenously corrected by the immune surveillance system. However, tumors evade this immunity by inducing immunosuppressive microenvironments during cancer progression. It has been thought that there are two critical components of tumors making them capable of maintaining the immunosuppressive microenvironment. One is the inhibition of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) activity against the tumor through immune checkpoint molecules, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death-1 (PD-1), which are negative regulators of CTL, and the other is by the induction of tumor infiltrating immune suppressive cells, which can deactivate the CTL. Recent studies demonstrate that multiple cancer types, including melanoma, lung, kidney, bladder, and stomach, respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-L1 and PD-1 with 11-30% response rates and durable responses. However, a substantial number of patients still fail to respond to immunotherapy and the refractory mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we focus on KRas-driven lung cancers, as there are no clinically effective targeted drugs available for treating this type of lung cancer. We demonstrate that during the progression of tumors in KRas mutation and p53 knockout-driven lung cancer mouse models; KRasG12D/+;p53-/- (KP), there is a gradual increase in the number of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and that the combination of either anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody along with a MEK inhibitor, which targets downstream of KRas signaling, shows anticancer efficacy in these animal models. These combinations, in comparison to either single agent alone, effectively blocks the growth of subcutaneously (s.c.) injected syngeneic mouse lung cancer cells in immune competent transgenic KP mice, significantly increasing the survival rates', ' 37.5% (for anti-PD-1 antibody and MEK inhibitor), 62.5% (for anti-PD-L1 antibody and MEK inhibitor) vs. 0% single agents or control at the end of treatment. We find that the tumors in the control treated group harbor a substantial number of immune cells, including PD-L1 expressing MDSC. The combination treatment with either an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody along with a MEK inhibitor dramatically modulates the composition and the activity of tumor infiltrated immune cells. Tumors in the combined treated group show a significant decrease in PD-L1 expressing MDSC in comparison with control tumors. Additionally, a combined treatment would block the PD-L1 activity of the infiltrated PD-L1 expressing MDSC in malignant tumors and thus lead to improved survival. These results point to a potential therapeutic opportunity for currently untargetable KRas-driven lung cancers.']",

Methods', ' We retrospectively identified 107 patients with breast cancer, diagnosed with BM, who had undergone surgery between 2001 and 2012 at 8 institutions. We collected 191 samples which included both BM samples alone and pair-matched samples (primary and BM). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides were evaluated for stromal TILs in 10% increments (01%, > 1< 10%, 10%100%). IHC was performed using the following primary antibodies', ' CD4, CD8, Foxp3, PD-L1, PD-L2 and HLA class I. The cells positive for each antibody signal were counted automatically using ImageJ (NIH). The expression of PD-L1, PD-L2, and HLA on the tumor cells was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak or focal), or 2 (strong). Results', ' The median category of TILs of BM tumors was > 1< 10% (range', ' 130%). Forty-six pair-matched samples were analyzed and the percentage of TILs in the primary breast tumor was significantly higher than that in BM samples (paired t-test, P < 0.01). The number of CD4/CD8/Foxp3 positive cells in primary breast tumor was also significantly higher than in BM samples (paired t-test, P < 0.05 for all categories). The negative/positive conversion occurred with the expression of HLA/PD-L2 on tumor cells (paired t-test, P = 0.03/0.06, respectively). No significant difference was observed in the overall survival (OS) of patients, from initial BM, based on high or low TILs (log-rank test, P = 0.131). However, triple negative breast cancer patients with low TILs had significantly shorter OS compared with patients with high TILs (log-rank test, P = 0.04). Conclusions', ' We demonstrated that TILs in BM tumors was significantly lower as compared to primary breast tumors.

Methods', ' De-identified data from molecular profiling on GC and BC tumors from the CARIS Life Sciences database was analyzed after obtaining IRB approval. TML was defined as the total number of nonsynonymous, somatic mutations per Mb sequenced with a 592-gene panel.

CPI-444 is a potent and selective oral A2AR antagonist. Daily treatment of mice with CPI-444 led to dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in multiple syngeneic tumor models. Combining CPI-444 with anti-PD-L1 treatment synergistically eliminated tumors in up to 90% of treated mice, including restoration of immune responses in models that are poorly responsive to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 monotherapy. We have initiated a Phase 1/1b clinical trial to examine safety, tolerability, biomarkers, and preliminary efficacy of CPI-444 as a single agent and in combination with the anti-PD-L1 antibody, atezolizumab, in patients with non-small cell lung, melanoma, renal, triple negative breast, and other (bladder, prostate, head and neck, colorectal) tumors. Step 1 of the trial focused on determining the optimal dose and schedule for CPI-444; Step 2 is currently evaluating the efficacy of optimal CPI-444 dosing alone and with atezolizumab. In 48 patients treated in Step 1, CPI-444 was well tolerated with 1 Grade 3 or 4 treatment related adverse events. Preliminary evidence of clinical activity was observed in patients treated with single agent CPI-444, including patients who previously failed anti-PD-1 therapy. A pCREB-based pharmacodyamic assay showed that 100 mg, BID dose of CPI-444 resulted in a complete, sustained inhibition of A2AR on circulating immune cells. CPI-444 treatment alone or in combination with atezolizumab resulted in increased frequency of circulating CD8+PD-1+ cells and memory/effector subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Substantial changes in TCR repertoire (Morisita Index <0.9) were observed in both anti-PD-1 native and refractory patients and correlated to patient responses. CD73 expression, CD8+ infiltration, TREG distribution, and gene expression signatures are currently being evaluated in serial tumor biopsy specimens and will be presented. In total, this shows that CPI-444 is well tolerated in cancer patients, exhibits functional inhibition of adenosine signaling, and treatment is associated with activation of anti-tumor immunity and clinical activity.']",

Here, we analyzed the impact of tumor genetics on the composition of tumor microenvironment across 21 solid cancer types from the TCGA project. Using specific mRNA markers of 10 cell populations (MCPcounter), we estimated the content of T cells, CD8+ T cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes, B lineage cells, NK cells, monocytic lineage cells, myeloid dendritic cells, neutrophils, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in tumor tissues. Immune cell compositions were correlated with mutational load, the activity of 27 mutational signatures (MutSigs) and PD-L1 mRNA expression. Correlation strength was assessed using Spearman’s rho statistics. Multiple testing was addressed using the Benjamini-Hochberg method and FDR control at 5%. MutSig 1 (clock-like, age-related) showed significant positive correlations with immune cell infiltrations in low-grade gliomas, negative correlations in breast cancer, melanoma, stomach cancer, lung and prostate adenocarcinoma, but no significant correlations in the remaining 15 cancer types. Of the two APOBEC-related signatures, MutSig 2 showed positive significant correlations with immune cell infiltrates in cervical cancer, bladder cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, head and neck cancer and thyroid cancer, MutSig 13 in breast and cervical cancer. In particular, correlation of MutSig 2 with cytotoxic lymphocytes was significant in cervical cancer, bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma (R = 0.29, R= 0.17 and R = 0.17), the corresponding correlation of MutSig 13 in breast cancer (R = 0.17). MutSig 4 (tobacco smoke-related) showed a positive significant correlation with CD8+ T cells and NK cells in lung adenocarcinoma (R = 0.15 and R = 0.14). In contrast, correlation of MutSig 4 with immune cell infiltrates was non-significant or negative in head and neck cancer. In colorectal cancer, MutSig 6 (defective mismatch repair) showed significant positive correlations with NK cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes, monocytic lineage cells and neutrophils infiltration (R = 0.45, R = 0.37, R = 0.23 and R = 0.19). PD-L1 mRNA expression and immune cell infiltrates correlated positively in all 21 cancer types. In particular, correlation with monocytic lineage cells was positive and significant in all cancer types and strong (R > 0.50) in 12 cancer types. Correlation with T cells was positive and significant in 18 cancer types and strong in 10 cancer types. In summary, pan-cancer analysis of DNA and RNAseq data showed that specific mutational signatures contribute to cancer cell immunogenicity, while the ubiquitous clock-like mutational process did not positively correlate with immune cell infiltrates in 20 of 21 cancer types.

Based on these important clinical achievements, immunotherapy with immunomodulating monoclonal antibodies (mAb) is being explored as a new therapeutic modality in most human malignancies, either alone or in combination with other immunomodulating agents. We have provided extensive evidence that the second generation DNA hypomethylating agent (DHA), guadecitabine (SGI-110), plays a promising role in potentiating the immunogenicity and the immune recognition of human malignancies through the up-regulation of the expression of different immune molecules on cancer cells. These findings led us to hypothesize that DHA could represent ideal partners for immune checkpoint(s) blocking agents to improve their therapeutic efficacy. Here, we studied the expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), and 2 (PD-L2), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (N = 23), enrolled in a phase 1-2 study with guadecitabine.

Results', ' ICOS mRNA expression was analyzed in ~10,000 solid tumors samples across ~30 indications. ICOS expression in key indications was confirmed using IHC. Based on frequency of high ICOS expression, non-small cell lung cancer, HNSCC, triple negative breast carcinoma, gastric cancer, and melanoma were selected as indications for ICONIC. Results were confirmed in clinical samples using multiplex immunofluorescence and ICOS IHC. A wide range of ICOS expression was observed suggesting that identification of an ICOS high group may enrich for patients likely to benefit from ICOS agonist therapy. In ex vivo histoculture assays of human HNSCC tumors treated with JTX-2011, ICOS IHC and ICOS RNA gene signatures correlated to response endpoints.
