        "Background":"['KIT is a critical pathway for melanocytic homeostasis and it is often down-regulated in cutaneous melanoma. However, KIT activation plays a critical role in a subpopulation of melanomas especially those in acral locations and melanomas on chronically sun damaged skin. We analyzed exome and RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Network (321 cutaneous melanomas in the data set) to identify patterns unique to KIT activation. The melanomas were divided based on known mutually exclusive mutations (BRAF, NRAS and KIT) vs those without (WT). We compared RNA data between each group. KIT group had significantly higher expression of KIT than BRAF, NRAS and WT (p<0.01, FDR<0.01) and isoform 2 expression was higher than 1. KIT melanomas were found to overexpress Wnt pathway, pigmentation and genes involved epithelial-mesenchymal transition. From the exome data, germline SNPs with incidence in ethnic groups (Caucasian, Asian and African) and more likely to be present in a specific melanoma groups were selected. Comparing the 3 ethnicity groups across the 4 tumor groups Asian SNPs were significantly enhanced in KIT tumors, African in WT and Caucasian in BRAF and NRAS melanomas. We evaluated the tumors for the primary type of genetic damage. The three signatures that appeared most divergent were CC>TT for UV, (G/A)C(G)>(G/A)T(G) for deamination, and G>T for oxidative damage. UV and deamination appeared inversely proportional, while oxidative damage appeared to be independent of those other two features. KIT and WT had a greater% of non UV high deamination tumoral environments. A fraction of these tumors also had very high oxidative signatures. We then compared 2 KIT subgroups UV vs non UV (absence of CC>TT mutations) for germline ethnicity differences. Asian SNPs were highly increased in non UV subgroup whereas Caucasian SNPs were in UV subgroup. Further, we divided KIT non UV subgroup into deamination and oxidative damage subgroups and compared ethnicity differences. Deamination was significantly higher in Asians whereas oxidative damage was higher in Caucasians. A similar analysis was done to the WT group, where African SNPs were significantly increased in the non UV subgroup and were primarily associated with oxidative damage. This data implies that KIT mutant melanomas develop in a unique genetic and mutational environments and makes this an ideal system to in which study racial disparities at the molecular level.']",

Our results show that step by step elimination of the GNNK tetrapeptide gradually increases receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, ubiquitination and downstream MAP kinase ERK activation.

The major cause of death in patients with advanced KIT-mutant cancers is due to the development of KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant (TKI-resistant) metastatic disease. Drug resistance arises almost exclusively from secondary mutations within KIT, highlighting the importance of KIT in the proliferation and survival of these tumors. Methods', ' We performed a human kinase siRNA screen in multiple KIT-mutant cancer cell lines using viability as a read out. We defined candidate targets as those whose knockdown decreased viability in all cell lines. Validation and mechanistic studies were done using a library of KIT-mutant GIST and melanoma cells.

Further, we found that decreased cell viability was due to induction of apoptosis, as assessed by measuring caspase 3 and 7 activity within 96 hours of LMTK3 silencing. LMTK3 knockdown also reduced tumor growth in vivo in a GIST xenograft model. Because these cells depend so heavily on KIT and the loss of KIT signaling results in cell death, we hypothesized that LMTK3 silencing may affect this pathway. Indeed, LMTK3 silencing decreased levels of autophosphorylated KIT. We also observed a significant decrease in total KIT protein expression.

A different pathogenesis has been proposed for ALM. Previous studies have profiled the importance of c-KIT, BRAF and NRAS mutations in melanoma treatment and prognosis. However, characterization of these somatic mutations in a specific non-Caucasian ALM population has not been reported. The Pacific Basin provides a unique opportunity to study diseases in diverse ethnic groups, including Pacific Islanders and Filipinos. We sought to determine the frequency of a triple negative genotype in our multi-ethnic cohort. Methods', ' IRB approval was obtained for this molecular analysis. From 1999 to 2011, 12 non-Caucasian patients (8-Filipino, 3-Pacific Islander and 1-Vietnamese) histologically confirmed to have ALM were evaluated at a tertiary institution. Data including age, gender, tumor location, Breslow thickness, Clark level, ulceration, regression, and mitoses per mm squared were compiled. Direct sequencing (c-KIT [Exons 8,9,11,13,17,18], NRAS [Exons 2,3]) and real-time PCR (BRAF [Exon 15]) was performed on formalin-fixed/ paraffin-embedded archived biospecimens (primary lesions). Results', ' Our findings demonstrated that 7/12 (58%) patients exhibited the triple negative genotype. Mutually exclusive somatic mutations (4 c-KIT and 1 BRAF) were identified in the remaining 5/12 (42%) patients. Those in the triple negative group trended toward a deeper Breslow thickness, when compared to those with a mutation (depth 4.73 mm vs. 3.07 mm). Demographics of the entire non-Caucasian cohort included a mean age of 72.0 years old (range 52-87) and male gender 6/12 (50%).

Conclusions', ' Non-Caucasian patients with ALM were found to have a high prevalence of the triple negative genotype. Those within that group appeared to have thicker tumors. Nearly half of our cohort had thick primary lesions with a high propensity for ulceration. This is the first study to our knowledge that has profiled somatic mutations (c-KIT, BRAF, NRAS) in a multi-ethnic population of ALM patients and examined the histologic correlates of a triple negative genotype.

The major cause of death in patients with advanced KIT-mutant cancers is due to KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant metastatic disease. Resistance develops almost exclusively because of secondary mutations within KIT, highlighting the importance of KIT in the proliferation and survival of these tumors. Therefore, strategies that affect KIT protein expression and maturation may be therapeutic. In order to identify regulators of KIT that may represent novel targets, we performed an siRNA screen in multiple KIT-mutant cancer cell lines. From these screens we identified lemur tyrosine kinase 3 (LMTK3) as a novel KIT regulator and potential target in KIT-mutant cancers. LMTK3 has been implicated as an important protein in multiple cancers, including leukemia, breast, and colon cancer. However, the oncogenic function of LMTK3 is not entirely clear. Despite its name, lemur tyrosine kinase 3 is, in fact, a serine/ threonine kinase. Beyond its enzymatic kinase function, LMTK3 has also been shown to have important scaffolding functions. LMTK3 has not been previously known to interact with KIT, but does regulate the stability of other receptors. We have found that LMTK3 silencing reduced the viability of all KIT-mutant GIST and melanoma cells tested to date, including those with ATP binding pocket and activation loop resistance mutations. Importantly, LMTK3 silencing decreased the viability of KIT-mutant cells specifically, as silencing of LMTK3 in cells lacking KIT mutations did not affect their viability. Further, we found the decrease in cell viability was due to induction of apoptosis, as seen by cleavage of PARP within 96 hours of LMTK3 silencing. Because these cells depend so heavily on KIT and loss of KIT signaling results in cell death, we hypothesized that LMTK3 silencing may be affecting this pathway. Indeed, with LMTK3 silencing there was a significant decrease in phosphorylated KIT (Y719), which was accompanied by decreased phospho-AKT (S473). We also observed a robust decrease in total KIT protein levels. However, there was no decrease in KIT transcript levels, suggesting that LMTK3 plays a role in regulating KIT at the protein level. While other KIT protein regulators, such as HSP90, have been suggested as therapeutic targets for GIST, the ubiquitous functions of these targets makes these treatments sub-optimal, often causing toxicity. Silencing of LMTK3, on the other hand, specifically kills KIT-mutant cancer cells. Furthermore, as a kinase, inhibition of LMTK3 by a small molecule may be possible, and we are in the process of identifying LMTK3 inhibitors. LMTK3 is a positive regulator of oncogenic KIT in GIST and melanoma and represents a novel, tractable target in KIT-mutant cancers.']",

        "Background":"['MITF, the master regulator of melanocytes, is a basic basic- helix- loop-helix- leucine zipper transcription factor that is essential for the development of melanocytes. MITF is also a lineage- survival oncogene in melanoma and recently, it has been shown that germline mutations in MITF predispose to this malignant disease. In melanoma, MITF has been proposed to act as a rheostat where high levels of MITF contribute to a proliferative phenotype whereas low levels result in a more invasive phenotype. The biological output generated by high or low levels of MITF is well characterized. However, how the activity of MITF is regulated to mediate these effects is less well known. It has been proposed that MITF is phosphorylated upon ligand induced activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase c- KIT. C-KIT engages the MAP kinase signaling cascade where ERK2 directly phosphorylates Ser73 of MITF and P90RSK phosphorylates the Ser409 residue of MITF. As a consequence, MITF activity increases and the protein is subjected to ubiquitin dependent degradation.Here, we show for the first time that c-KIT induces phosphorylation of MITF through the survival PI3 kinase- AKT pathway, the P38 stress pathway as well as the well-known MAP kinase-ERK signaling pathway. In addition, we show that the SRC kinase upstream of ERK is essential for c-KIT induced MITF activation. Moreover, we used several c-KIT phosphorylation site mutants to map the specific sites that are involved in the mediating transcription activation potential of MITF. These mutants also show less effects on MITF-mediated proliferation.We have generated phosphorylation specific antibodies against Ser73 and Ser409 of MITF and characterized the phosphorylation pattern of MITF using these reagents. Our results suggest that there is a particular relationship between Ser73 and Ser409 with subsequent effects on function. Based on our findings, we propose that phosphorylation of MITF might act as negative feedback mechanism that keeps MITF activity in check. Our model challenges the current knowledge of MITF modulation and provides insights that may have a profound impact on our understanding of the role of MITF in melanocyte and melanoma biology.']",

Methods', '  25  patients had tumor specimen available at baseline and tested for c-KIT mutation, amplification and c-KIT expression. Twelve had available follow-up biopsies, 5 with a progressive disease (PD), 8 with a stable disease (SD), 1 with a partial response (PR). Follow-up biopsies were tested for c-KIT secondary mutations, gene copy number variation and expression related to angiogenesis, apoptosis and proliferation. IHC staining was performed on sections at baseline and after treatment for c-KIT, p-ERK, p-AKT and p-MEK.  Results', '  C-KIT expression was confirmed in all patients treated with nilotinib at baseline. The presence of a c-KIT exon 11 or 13 mutations was associated with clinical response. No secondary c-KIT mutations were detected at progression. c-KIT gene copy number revealed an amplification in 5 out of 25 patients prior to treatment without association with response rate. However, 1 SD patient had a decrease in c-KIT amplification after treatment. VEGFR-2 gene copy number whose co-amplification with c-KIT is frequent in other solid cancers was not associated with clinical outcome. pMek and pErk decreased in some SD and PR patients, with no variation of pAKT. Interestingly, using transcriptomic analyses FGF2 overexpression prior to treatment was observed in all PR and SD patients studied.  Conclusions', '  Clinical response is associated with c-KIT exon 11 or 13 mutations, and not with the sole amplification of c-KIT. In this study, we found no mutation associated with primary resistance.

        "Background":"['Purpose', ' Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), the most common abdominal sarcoma, arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal in the wall of the gut. Eighty percent of GISTs harbor activating mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT. Despite progress in medical treatment of GIST, advanced disease remains incurable. In addition to GIST, activating KIT mutations are found in cases of mast cell neoplasms, AML, melanoma and seminoma. Therefore, there is a compelling need to identify new targets whose inhibition is synergistic when combined with biochemical inhibition of KIT. Based on shared oncogenic kinase mechanisms with CML, we hypothesized that combined inhibition of KIT and a novel Wnt/Ca++/Calcineurin/NFAT pathway would synergistically inhibit the proliferation of KIT mutant cells.Experimental methods', ' We sequentially combined four different calcineurin inhibitors with five different KIT inhibitors and measured cell proliferation and caspase 3/7activity in nine unique KIT mutant cell lines. Using the Chou and Talalay method we calculated combination indices to quantify drug-drug interactions. Changes in NFAT phosphorylation and localization in KIT mutant cells were assessed by immunoblotting. Finally, we measured NFAT transcriptional activity using an NFAT-responsive reporter cell line.Results', ' In contrast to other cellular models, NFAT appeared to be constitutively active and localized in the nucleus in many KIT mutant cell lines. We observed synergy when we combined a calcineurin inhibitor with a KIT inhibitor in all KIT mutant cell lines where NFAT was constitutively active. Combination index (CI) values for the different KIT mutant cell lines ranged from 0.3-0.5. To investigate whether NFAT was required for this synergy, we combined NFAT specific inhibitors with KIT inhibitors and found synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation. We created a KIT-mutant reporter cell line where NFAT binding drives the expression of luciferase. As expected, NFAT transcriptional activity decreased when our promoter-reporter cell line was treated with calcineurin inhibitors and increased with TPA and ionomycin treatment. Unexpectedly, we also found that KIT inhibitors decreased NFAT transcriptional activity in this cell model.Conclusions', ' These data indicate that combination therapy using a calcineurin phosphatase inhibitor and a KIT kinase inhibitor results in synergistic killing of KIT mutant cells. Additionally, the constitutive activation of NFAT in these cell lines indicate aberrant signaling in the Wnt/Ca2+/calcineurin/NFAT pathway, which has not been previously reported in KIT mutant cell lines. The observed synergy between NFAT inhibitors and KIT inhibitors suggests this effect is mediated by NFAT rather than other calcineurin targets. Finally, the fact that KIT inhibitors modulated NFAT transcriptional activity suggests crosstalk between KIT and NFAT signaling pathways.']",

DCC-2618 is a robust Type II switch pocket control inhibitor which potently inhibits exon 17 KIT mutations that are resistant to conventional TKIs.Experimental procedures', 'DCC-2618 was tested for inhibition of KIT isoforms using a standard PK/LDH coupled spectrophotometric assay. CHO cells were transiently transfected to express mutant KIT or PDGFR constructs. Transfected cells were treated with a range of DCC-2618 and levels of phosphorylated KIT or PDGFR in cell lysates were determined by ELISA or western blot. Cell proliferation of several cell lines was measured using the fluorescent dye resazurin. Experiments were performed in triplicate. In vivo xenograft models were performed at Molecular Imaging, Inc.

In CHO cells transiently transfected with both single and double (primary/secondary) KIT mutants, DCC-2618 robustly inhibited exon 17, exon 9/13, exon 9/14, and exon 9/17 KIT mutants, as well as exon 11/17 KIT mutants, including exon 17 D816V, D816G, D820A, D820E, D820Y, N822K, N822Y, N822H, and Y823D primary or secondary mutations.DCC-2618 inhibited wild type KIT phosphorylation in the MO7e cell line (IC50 36 nM). DCC-2618 potently inhibited KIT activation in human GIST cell lines, including GIST T1 (exon 11 deletion, IC50 2 nM), GIST 430 (exon 11 deletion/exon 13 V654A, IC50 7 nM), and GIST 48 (exon 11 V560D/exon 17 D820A, IC50 53 nM). In the murine mastocytosis P815 cell line expressing the exon 17 D816Y mutation, DCC-2618 potently inhibited cell proliferation (IC50 2 nM).In vivo, DCC-2618 administration at 50 mg/kg afforded an ED90 for inhibition of KIT phosphorylation in the GIST T1 xenograft model, corresponding to an EC90 concentration of  470 ng/mL. When give twice daily, this oral dose resulted in almost complete tumor stasis. This dose of DCC-2618 produced tumor regressions in a patient derived xenograft (PDX) GIST expressing KIT exon 11 delW557K558/exon 17 Y823D, and also in a KIT exon 17 N822K AML xenograft model.Conclusion', ' DCC-2618 is a potent inhibitor of singly and doubly mutated KIT characterized by primary exon 9 or exon 11 mutations paired with secondary mutations in exons 13, 14 or 17.

Efforts to improve the treatment of melanoma have focused on specific molecular defects following the discovery that the majority of patients have a mutation in one of three members of the BRAF-MAPK signaling pathway', ' KIT, BRAF, and RAS. Recent clinical trials have shown promise for drugs that target the molecular defects in melanoma, including the recently approved mutant BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. As new drugs that target specific mutations move through clinical trials, the opportunity to perform precision medicine is becoming a reality. To deliver on the promise shown by the new generation of drugs it will be necessary to detect specific mutations in patients so they can be matched with the right drug. To this end, we have used an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine to sequence the six most commonly mutated codons in melanoma (BRAF 600, NRAS 12 and 13, NRAS 61, KIT 576, and KIT 642) from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue of late stage melanoma patients. All six codons of interest were sequenced in forty-six patients and mutations identified by comparison to normal controls.

Samples were sequenced in a multiplexed format using bar coding of the amplicons which allowed 14 patients and two controls to be sequenced simultaneously on each chip.

Analysis of malignant transformation of melanocytes and melanoma progression frequently utilizes immortalized melanoma cell lines that propagated in the laboratory. We studied the diversity of genetic mutations in the MAPK pathway in established melanoma cell lines and compared it to that of human melanoma tissue samples. Methods', ' We screened 30 well-established human melanoma cell lines, the majority of which were derived from melanoma metastases at dermal or nodal locations, for 85 mutations found within the AKT1, BRAF, KIT, KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA and PTEN genes by RT-PCR. We then interrogated 263 melanoma genomes available in the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) skin cutaneous melanoma dataset for the presence and frequency of these mutations. Mutational frequencies were determined by sorting the data in MS Excel. Results', ' BRAF was mutated in 39% of TCGA melanoma genomes and 53% of cell line genomes. NRAS genes were mutated in 26% of TCGA samples and 13% of cell lines. Cell lines were 34 times more likely to bear a KIT mutation than TCGA samples. Mutations in each of the 8 tested genes except PTEN were found in TCGA genome samples, while cell lines contained mutations in BRAF, KIT, NRAS, PTEN, and lacked any of the tested mutations in AKT1, KRAS, HRAS, PIK3CA. Cell lines exhibited a higher frequency of unique mutational combinations. Both BRAF and KIT were mutated in 13% of cell lines, and each of NRAS and KIT; NRAS and PTEN; and NRAS, BRAF and PTEN in 3.3% of cell lines; all these combinations were absent in TCGA melanoma genomes. Mutations in PIK3CA combined with either BRAF or NRAS were found in 1% of TCGA samples but absent from cell lines. Conclusions', ' These data indicate that mutational status and frequency of individual mutations and mutation combinations found in melanoma cell lines can diverge from that observed in clinical tissue specimens. Additional changes observed in cell lines may provide insight into evolutionary mutations in progressive melanoma.

        "Background":"['c-Kit is an attractive target for the treatment of a variety of solid tumors [gastrointestinal tumors (GIST), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), melanoma] and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) due to its role as an oncogenic driver and high level of expression. Several targeted therapies, such as imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib, bind to c-Kit and are approved for clinical use. However, due to their insufficient activity on cancers expressing wildtype c-Kit or insensitive forms of mutant c-Kit, the clinical response has been quite varied. Moreover, despite initial anti-cancer benefits in c-Kit mutant settings (such as in GIST), resistance to c-Kit inhibitor therapies emerges due primarily to the development of additional mutations in c-Kit.In an attempt to broaden the treatment of patients whose cancers express c-Kit (wildtype and mutant) and to enhance potency with comparable or better tolerability than the current therapeutics, we developed a c-Kit-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that disrupts tumor growth through anti-mitotic activity. Hybridomas from mice immunized with the c-Kit extracellular domain (ECD) were screened for selective c-Kit binding and degradation. A humanized lead antibody (Ab) was identified, which rapidly internalized upon binding cell-surface c-Kit, but did not block binding to the c-Kit ligand (SCF). The Ab exhibited minimal-to-no cytotoxicity against c-Kit+ cell lines in vitro. To generate cytotoxic activity and to potentially overcome resistance to current c-Kit-targeting therapies, the Ab was conjugated to the maytansinoid DM1, a powerful anti-tubulin agent, via a non-cleavable linker, SMCC (technology licensed from ImmunoGen, Inc.). The ADC demonstrated robust anti-proliferative activity against cell lines expressing mutant c-Kit (GIST) and wildtype c-Kit (SCLC, AML) in vitro. The ADC also demonstrated potent anti-cancer activity in GIST and SCLC tumor xenograft models in vivo.In summary, the anti-c-Kit ADC is highly selective and active against cancers with elevated c-Kit expression regardless of their mutational status, thus representing a promising novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of c-Kit+ solid tumors, such as GIST and SCLC, as well as hematological malignancies such as AML and aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM).']",

For combined 22C3 and 28.8, 61 of 135 cases (45%) had PD-L1 expression and 31 (23%) had BRAF mutation detected using FDA kits (V600). There was no statistical correlation between PD-L1 expression and BRAF mutation in this group (P = 0.9) at any cut-off. In cases tested with SP142 clone, BRAF mutation was detected in 31 cases (55%) by NGS, higher than using the FDA kit (P < 0.0001). In V600 mutations by NGS, 14 cases (25%) were positive, similar FDA kits. In SP142 cases, PD-L1 was positive in 45% of cases. There was no correlation between BRAF mutation and PD-L1 using SP142 expression as a continuous variable (P = 0.59) or cut-off points of 5% or 50%. When cut-off of 20% was used, significant inverse correlation with BRAF mutation (P = 0.004) was identified and was maintained if V600 codon only was evaluated. Conclusions', ' There is no correlation between BRAF mutation and PD-L1 expression as detected using clones 22C3 and 28.8. With SP142, a negative correlation between PD-L1 expression and BRAF mutation is identified with a 20% cut-off. The rate of BRAF mutations practically doubles when NGS is used and exons 11 and 15 are included in the testing, in contrast to FDA approved testing.']",

        "Background":"['Melanoma causes the greatest morbidity and mortality of all skin cancers and often harbors amplifications or activating mutations in KIT, a type III transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) involved in cancer cell growth, migration, invasion and metastasis. At present, no treatment that provide either sufficient response rates or a significant prolongation of overall survival are available for melanoma. In the last decade, several inhibitors of RTK (RTKi) have been developed for the treatment of cancer, however, a number of short-comings was observed. Therefore, novel TK inhibitors with improved selectivity were developed for the treatment of diseases associated with KIT activation. Masitinib (AB1010), a RTKi capable of blocking selectively KIT, is one such new drug. Using B16 melanoma subcutaneous graft on C57Bl6 mice, we demonstrate that Masitinib is able to limit tumor growth in vivo and increase mice survival. This anti-tumoral effect was not observed for other RTKi targeting KIT. Suprisingly, Masitinib has no effect on melanoma proliferation in vitro, suggesting instead that modulation on tumor environment takes place. Indeed, mast cells that accumulate in the tumors secrete several biologically active factors involved in the modulation of tumor growth. In vivo, Masitinib treatment completely abrogates mast cell maturation and migration resulting in decreased tumor invasion and down-regulation of several angiogenic factors. Using a mouse line deficient for mast cells (Wsh/Wsh), we confirmed that Masitinib effect is in part dependent of its inhibition on mast cell migration and maturation. Indeed, additional effect occurs on macrophage polarization leaning from tolerogenic toward anti-tumoral phenotype. Furthermore, in vivo macrophage depletion favored tumor promotion and reverses Masitinib effect on tumor growth. The results provided by this study suggest that Masitinib may be a useful therapy on melanoma by its dual role on tumor environment. It can block mast cell maturation and infiltration in the tumor site, avoiding the angiogenic effects of mast cells. It can revert tumor tolerent macrophage status leading to an increased inflammatory activity within the tumor microenvironment.These effects are not observed only on melanoma, but also on other types of cancer, suggesting the cellular mechanisms triggered by Masitinib occur in various tumoral process. For instance, a phase III clinical trial with Masitinib as GIST treatment is currently ongoing.']",

Although KITD816V has been found in melanoma, its function and involvement in this malignancy is not understood. Here we show that KITD816V induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) through a triple protein complex formation between KIT, MITF and SRC family kinases. In turn, phosphorylated MITF activates target genes that are involved in melanoma proliferation, cell cycle progression, suppression of senescence, survival and invasion. By blocking the triple protein complex formation, thus preventing MITF phosphorylation, the cells become hypersensitive to SRC inhibitors.

Addiction of melanoma to the MAPK pathways led to the development of inhibitors targeting either mutant BRAF, such as Vemurafenib (PLX4032), or MEK. Melanoma treatment recently met a breakthrough with the clinical evaluation of Vemurafenib that demonstrated an unprecedented 80% response rate among patients with BRAF V600E melanomas treated with Vemurafenib, but rapidly limited by drug resistance, which still requires to be elucidated.The MAPK pathway regulates the expression of many genes which can mediate therapeutic response but also resistance, such as RhoGTPases. We analysed the mRNA expression of the RhoGTPases in two BRAF mutated melanoma cell lines, WM266-4 and A375, in response to inhibition of the MAPK pathway by PLX4032. We observed that the mRNA of RhoB was increased by PLX4032 treatment. This result was confirmed in many other BRAF mutated melanoma cell lines by inhibition of the MAPK pathway with BRAF inhibitors (PLX4032 or SB-590885) as well as MEK inhibitors (AZD6244 or AS703026). MEK inhibitors (AZD6244 or AS703026) upregulate RhoB in BRAF wild-type melanoma cells harbouring N-Ras, K-Ras or c-KIT mutation suggesting that inhibiting MAPK pathway is critical for RhoB expression modulation. It is noteworthy that this modulation is cell type dependent, while it was not found in BRAF mutated non-melanoma cells as colon carcinoma cells (Colo205 and RKO).To investigate the role of RhoB induction in cellular responses to BRAF and MEK inhibitors, the RhoB induction was suppressed using RNA interference. The cells treated with siRNA targeting RhoB, WM266-4 and A375 cells, were more sensitive to PLX4032 and AZD6244. Moreover the blockade of RhoB induction led to a significant increase of PLX4032-induced apoptosis as shown by the increase of the subG1 population and PARP cleavage.Our findings show that RhoB upregulation is involved in PLX4032 response and both inhibitions of MAPK pathway and RhoB expression trigger cell death and should prompt a search for agents. Indeed co-targeting MAPK and RhoB pathways, could lead to a synthetic lethality and prevent resistance to either BRAF or MEK inhibitors.

A substitution of an aspartate for a valine at position 816 (D816V) is one of the most commonly found oncogenic c-Kit mutation and is found in more than 90% of cases of mastocytosis and in a subgroup of germ cell tumors, core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia and mucosal melanomas.

Here we have investigated the role of Y823 in the activation loop of c-Kit and its role in oncogenic transformation by c-Kit/D816V. Although dispensable for the kinase activity of c-Kit/D816V, the presence of Y823 was shown to be crucial for cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, mutation of Y823 selectively down-regulated the Ras/Erk and Akt pathways. It also led to decreased phosphorylation of STAT5 and reduced the transforming capacity of D816V/c-Kit in vitro. The sensitivity to kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib and nilotinib, was decreased in cells expressing c-Kit/Y823F/D816V compared to cells c-Kit/D816V. Mice injected with cells expressing c-Kit/D816V/Y823F displayed significantly reduced tumor size as well as tumor weight compared to controls. Finally, microarray array analysis, comparing c-Kit/Y823F/D816V cells with cells expressing c-Kit/D816V, demonstrate that mutation of Y823 causes up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes whereas genes of survival pathways are down-regulated.

        "Background":"['Targeted deep massive parallel sequencing (MPS) has been implemented in routine molecular diagnostics for high-throughput genetic profiling of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cancer samples. This approach is now widely used to interrogate simple somatic mutations but experience with the analysis of copy number variations (CNV) is still limited. Here, we retrospectively analyzed CNVs in 822 cancer cases (n = 135 melanoma, n = 468 non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), n = 219 colorectal cancers (CRC)) that were sent to our institution for routine molecular profiling using a semiconductor based sequencing platform. Amplifications and deletions inferred by MPS coverage data were independently validated by a qPCR assay. We observed a decreasing frequency of CNV in clinically actionable genes from melanoma to NSCLC to colorectal cancer.Of 56 melanomas with genetic aberrations in BRAF, 31 showed co-occurring CNV in other genes, mainly affecting CDKN2A. Some tumors (5 cases each) revealed clustered deletions affecting either ABL1, NOTCH1, and RET or STK11, GNA11, and JAK3. 8.1% of the cases had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In the group of NRAS mutant tumors (n = 39), 26 showed co-occurring CNVs in other genes, such as CDKN2A and FGFR3, and 9 NRAS mutant cases were additionally mutated in BRAF. 19.1% had amplifications in clinically actionable genes. In contrast to BRAF mutant tumors, we did not see any specific CNV clusters. In the group of BRAF/NRASwt tumors (n = 11), we observed 5 cases with co-amplification of KDR, KIT, PDGFRA and another 6 cases with KIT mutations. While co-amplified cases had many gene deletions, KIT mutated tumors harbored only very few genetic aberrations in other genes.Across both NSCLC data sets, we identified 14 cases with amplified EGFR (10 of them harboring co-occurring EGFR mutations) and detected 8 NSCLC with KRAS amplifications (of which 7 had co-occurring mutations of KRAS). KRAS mutated tumors displayed frequent amplifications in MYC (n = 10) and MDM2 (n = 5). Of the 22 BRAF mutant tumors, two harbored mutated KRAS. In contrast to melanoma, we observed no clustering of CNVs in BRAFmut NSCLCs. Within the group of KRAS/EGFR/BRAFwt tumors, we identified 15 cases harboring genetic aberrations in MET (n = 8 mutations, n = 7 amplifications).Compared to melanoma and NSCLC, the number of CNV in CRC was rather low. IGF2 amplifications were most prevalent (n = 13) followed by MYC (n = 9). Two cases showed amplified wild-type alleles of KRAS. Two KRAS mutant tumors showed concomitant amplification of NRAS and three cases harbored amplified EGFR.In conclusion we demonstrate that i) detection of CNVs by targeted MPS data obtained from FFPE material is feasible and ii) could be validated independently, iii) this approach enables detection of known CNV patterns, and iv) uncovers new CNV patterns in clinically actionable targets across cancers.']",

        "Background":"['Recent advances in targeted and immunotherapies have unlocked potent treatment options for malignant melanoma patients. However, targeted therapies are associated with limited response durations and only a fraction of patients benefit from immunotherapies. The analysis of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) provides a powerful tool for the continuous assessment of treatment responses in melanoma patients.We have established a robust pipeline for the serial, prospective analysis of ctDNA in melanoma patients. By combining next generation sequencing (NGS)- and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)-based approaches we make ideal use of currently available technologies. To date, plasma samples from over 120 individuals have been collected, with follow-up times surpassing one year in many cases.For routine monitoring of patients commencing BRAF-mutant targeted therapies, pre-treatment DNA, derived from tumour biopsy or plasma, is tested to confirm the exact BRAF mutation and rule out pre-existing resistance-associated mutations using a custom NGS sequencing panel. Timely follow-up throughout treatment is achieved by measuring mutant BRAF fractions in ctDNA using ddPCR. When increasing BRAF variant allele frequencies are detected, additional ddPCR-based profiling for NRAS mutations and NGS-based re-sequencing for other resistance-associated mutations is initiated. We demonstrate superiority of ctDNA monitoring over LDH measurements and present a strategy to detect emerging resistant disease ahead of clinical scans in a cost-effective, timesaving and low technology way.In addition to the basic characterization of BRAF-mutant cases undergoing targeted therapy, we have used the analysis of ctDNA to uncover clonally distinct tumour sub-populations resulting in complex responses to treatment. For instance, we monitored a case of metastatic vaginal mucosal melanoma undergoing sequential targeted, immuno- and chemotherapy. Despite the presence of a KIT mutation in the primary tumour, response to KIT inhibitor imatinib was mixed. In the absence of tumour biopsies, we used whole exome-wide NGS of ctDNA to study the underlying mechanisms. This strategy revealed a KIT-mutant tumour sub-clone that responded to imatinib and a second sub-clone including an SF3B1 mutation that did not respond. The sub-clones also responded differentially to immunotherapies, but both responded to chemotherapy.The analysis of ctDNA is a powerful approach to monitor responses to systemic therapies in melanoma. By providing early warning of resistance and crucial information of clonal composition/evolution of the disease, ctDNA analysis has the potential to revolutionize the implementation of precision medicine.']",

Matrix chips were assayed on a Sequenom MassArray MALDI-TOF Mass Array system. Visual inspection and Sequenom Typer software were used to perform genotyping based on mass spectra.

Although the number of NRASQ61 mutant cases was slightly higher among the Irish melanoma patients compared with Belgium patients (20.6% and 13.3%, respectively), this does not fully account for the difference in BRAFV600E mutation rate. In contrast, many BRAFV600 WT patients in the SVUH cohort carried significantly increased mutation rates in MET (11.4%) compared to the Leuven cohort (0%) and reported elsewhere (2%). c-MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that activates multiple signal transduction pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, WNT, and Notch.

The detection of CTCs has gained increasing interest for prediction of clinical outcome. However, it remains to be determined whether uveal melanoma cells circulating in a peripheral vein predict systemic recurrence and poorer overall prognosis.Uveal melanoma, the most common primary cancer of the eye in adults, is unique in that the uveal tract is devoid of lymphatics. Since systemic recurrence develops exclusively via hematogenous spread, patients with uveal melanomas present a special opportunity to explore the prognostic potential of CTCs. Although the lung is the first organ through which venous drainage from the affected eye passes and indeed the only organ through which all venous blood must pass, 80-95% of systemic metastases are found first in the liver without development of lung metastases. To address these issues, we investigated the numbers of CTCs in paired arterial (femoral) and venous (antecubital) blood specimens obtained from uveal melanoma patients with hepatic metastases.Methods', ' CTCs in blood specimens were measured in 17 uveal melanoma patients with multiple hepatic metastases, including 10 patients with liver-only metastases and 7 patients with hepatic and extra-hepatic metastases. Peripheral arterial and venous blood specimens were collected at the same time prior to liver directed treatment. CTCs were analyzed using CellTracks Circulating melanoma Cell Kit by CellSearch System. The clinical information and sources of blood specimens were blinded when CTCs were analyzed.Result', ' CTCs were detectable from all 17 arterial blood specimens (100%) (median 5, range 1 to 168).

In terms of degree of tumor burden, patients who have hepatic as well as extra-hepatic metastasis showed higher numbers of arterial CTCs (median 12, range 5 to 168), compared to patients who have liver-only metastasis (median 4, range 1 to 11). More importantly, there is no significant correlation between numbers of arterial CTCs and the degree of tumor volume in the liver in patients who have liver-only metastases.Conclusions', ' Using this technology, the detection of uveal melanoma cells in peripheral blood is feasible. Peripheral capillary beds effectively filter CTCs from venous blood; thus venous blood might not be the best source for measurement of CTCs in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. The paucity of clinically evident non-hepatic metastases despite the effective filtration by peripheral capillary beds remains unexplained and may be a demonstration of the seed and soil hypothesis.

Cell proliferation was measured by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Cells were stained with propidium iodide and cell cycle was assessed using flow cytometer. Protein phosphorylation microarray was performed by using a commercially available kit (Cancer Signaling Phospho-Antibody Array). Results', ' SOCE, as demonstrated by enhancement of Ca2+ entry from extracellular space after Ca2+ depletion in the ER, was observed in SK-MEL-2, C8161, SK-MEL-24, UACC257 (human) and B16 (mouse) melanoma cell lines, suggesting that the existence of SOCE is universal among melanoma cells. SOCE was attenuated by Pyr3, a pyrazole compound which is known to inhibit SOCE, as well as by EGTA that chelates extracellular Ca2+. Pyr3 inhibits cellular proliferation in SK-MEL-2 cells (IC50', ' 5.1uM) and C8161 cells (IC50', ' 2.1uM). Cell cycle was analyzed in C8161 cells, and the cell number in the G2 phase was increased by both Pyr3 and EGTA, indicating that SOCE plays a role in the transition of G2/S phase. Protein microarray data showed that Pyr3 reduces phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) by 93%, suggesting that the JAK/STAT pathway may be involved in SOCE-induced alteration of cell cycle. Conclusion', ' Our results showed that inhibition of SOCE suppresses proliferation in melanoma, thus it could be a new strategy for melanoma therapy.']",

A panel of plasma biomarkers of angiogenesis and soluble receptors were evaluated to determine the pharmacodynamic effect of TKI258. Methods', ' Patients were treated orally with 200, 300, 400 or 500 mg/day on a once daily continuous dose schedule. The MTD was defined at 400 mg/day. Plasma samples from 43 patients were collected. Plasma concentration of TKI258 was measured by LC/MS/MS. Plasma VEGF, placental growth factor (PLGF), basic FGF (bFGF), and soluble VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 (sVEGFR1 and 2), and c-Kit were measured by multiplex assays using the Meso-Scale Discovery platform. Plasma FGF23 was evaluated by ELISA as a pharmcodynamic marker of FGFR1 inhibition. Results', ' Following 400 mg or 500 mg continuous daily dosing, the mean plasma exposure (AUC24hr) was approximately 3000 ng/mL*h and 4100 ng/mL*h, respectively. No accumulation in TKI258 plasma exposure was observed at doses of 400mg or below, while accumulation up to 2.5-fold was observed on day 15 following the 500 mg daily dose. At the end of the first treatment cycle, mean plasma VEGF, PLGF and FGF23 levels increased over baseline by 100%, 198% and 68%, respectively, while mean plasma sVEGFR2 levels decreased by 15% in patients treated with 400 and 500 mg/day TKI258. Further analysis of correlations with pharmacokinetic and clinical parameters is ongoing. Conclusions', ' TKI258 therapy is associated with increases of plasma VEGF and PLGF as well as decreases of sVEGFR2 suggesting VEGFR inhibition. Induction of plasma FGF23 suggest that FGFR may be inhibited at doses of 400 mg/day and above.

Patients enrolled on the trial had either unresectable, locally advanced Stage III or Stage IV melanoma. We analyzed patients tumor samples for 74 mutations in 13 genes using a custom iPlex (Sequenom). We have preliminarily analyzed 157 tumor samples from patients enrolled in this clinical trial. Analysis of the initial data set demonstrates that 62 samples (42%, 62/148, 95% CI 34%,50%) carried BRAF mutations - 60 samples with V600 and two samples having a BRAF V601 mutation. Thirty eight samples (26%, 38/148, 95% CI 19%,33%) were positive for NRAS mutations, with 33 with Q61, two G12 and three G13 mutations. With the exception of one tumor sample, the BRAF and NRAS mutations were negatively correlated with each other, consistent with prior observations. We also observed a number of rare mutations in our samples including one in AKT1, one in AKT3, four in CDK4, five in beta-catenin, two in GNAQ and three in KIT. The results of this study demonstrated no difference between the two treatment arms in OS and PFS and no association with treatment outcome and BRAF and NRAS mutations. Consequently, the treatment arms were collapsed, and we examined the relationship of BRAF and NRAS mutations with OS and PFS. Interestingly, our data demonstrated that the BRAF and NRAS mutations did not correlate with OS or PFS. This sample population is unique in that it provides a large data set of melanoma tumor samples, all of whom were entered on a clinical trial, unselected for pre-existing mutations. Using the Sequenom assay platform, we have identified a number of mutations in a subset of genes known to be involved in melanoma in patient tumor samples. In the future, these tumor samples will be informative as we continue to examine and identify additional genetic alterations in melanoma, providing information regarding the natural history and distribution of certain mutations. Future studies will use array comparative genomic hybridization to further investigate additional somatic mutations occurring in melanoma tumors and correlate these with clinical outcome, as well as provide insight into the pathogenesis of melanoma.

        "Background":"['Metastatic melanoma is a complicated disease with growing rates of diagnosis and few clinical treatment options currently available. While melanoma results in only 5% of skin cancers, it is the cause of 75% of all skin cancer deaths. In 2008, the American Cancer Society (ACS) reported 62,480 new cases of melanoma. Of these individuals, 8,420 died, including 5,400 men and 3,020 women. According to the ACS for 2010, the 5-year survival rate for stage IV melanoma is 15% to 20% and the 10-year survival is 10% to 15%. To improve survival it is important to establish which genes are involved in the regulation of metastasis in melanoma as potential targets for prevention and/or treatment. Our laboratory compared the differences in the relative expression levels of metastasis genes from two human melanoma cell lines and a normal melanocyte cell line. The normal melanocyte cell line was assayed in duplicate and averaged as an inner plate control in order to validate the assay. Established melanoma, SK-mel-103 and SK-mel-147, were investigated. Template cDNA was prepared from total RNA from these lines using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit. The melanoma cell lines were both male and matched on GPR-30 and ER beta expression and B-RAF and N-RAS mutation status but they differed in G2 checkpoint and p16 mutation status. RT Array technology was utilized to compare the relative levels of mRNA from metastasis related genes expressed in SK-mel lines. The Human Tumor Metastasis RT2 Profiler PCR Array contains 84 primer pairs that amplify genes involved in human metastasis. Genes on this array include those that regulate cell adhesion, the extracellular matrix components, cell cycle, cell growth and proliferation, apoptosis, and transcription factors and regulators. The PCR array is a set of optimized real-time PCR primer assays on a 384-well plate for pathway focused genes and includes appropriate RNA quality controls. The quantitative PCR was run on the ABI 7900 HT using the real-time PCR cycling program. Total RNA from normal and melanoma tumors were characterized and the relative expression levels for each gene in the two melanoma samples were plotted against each other and against the normal cell line in scatter plots. Gene expression with controls samples was highly correlated. Genes involved in metastasis were up or down regulated in the melanoma cell lines compared to the normal cell lines. Upregulation of genes associated with DNA replication has previously been correlated with metastatic aggressiveness in melanoma cell lines. Conversely the down regulation of genes has been associated with an increase in cellular adhesion and melanocyte differentiation. This research identifies metastatic genes that contribute to the metastatic aggressiveness in the SK-mel metastatic melanoma cell lines. In the future we plan to examine the genes identified in this study for novel drug repurposing experiments.']",

UM differs from cutaneous melanoma in that it lacks BRAF, NRAS, or KIT mutations but instead harbors mutations in the Gq family members GNAQ and GNA11 in over 80 to 90% of cases. Understanding the downstream effector pathways of these oncoproteins is of considerable interest to identify opportunities for targeted therapy. Using 293T cells, immortalized mouse and human melanocytes, we find that GNAQQ209L or GNA11Q209L induce activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) and MAPK pathways. ShRNA mediated knock-down of mutant GNAQ abrogates both PKC and MAPK activation in human melanoma cell lines or model systems. Using two different PKC inhibitors we found selective extinction of PKC and MAPK signalling and induction of G1 arrest in panels of melanoma cell lines carrying GNAQ or GNA11 mutations, whereas no such effect was observed in melanoma cell lines with other mutations. MAPK activation occurred downstream of activated PKC in cells with GNAQ or GNA11 mutations. In contrast to PKC inhibitors, which selectively inhibited the growth of melanoma cell lines with GNAQ or GNA11 mutations, the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 inhibited melanoma cell lines irrespective of their GNAQ/11 mutation status. In vivo the PKC inhibitor AEB071 slowed the growth of tumors in an allograft model of GNAQQ209L transduced melanocytes, but did not induce tumor shrinkage. Analysis of tumor lysates identified suppression of PKC signaling but not of MAP-kinase pathway signaling under chronic PKC inhibition. The rebound of MAP-kinase activation could be overcome using a combination of AEB071 with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901, which showed strong synergy in halting proliferation and in inducing apoptosis. Our data suggest that PKC is a rational therapeutic target for melanoma patients with GNAQ or GNA11 mutations and indicate that a combination therapy with MEK inhibitor is superior to treatment with either approach alone.']",

The QS3D digital PCR system concluded on the presence of a BRAF mutation in only 20/34 samples (PPA = 58.8%) mostly because of an insufficient number of circulating DNA copies to reach a relevant statistic value. Conclusions', ' The Qiagen and the Entrogen assays are based on allele-specific amplification, a technique easy to use without a specific training, unlike dPCR which requires specific equipment and training to acquire technical and interpretation skills.

Many prevalent genetic alterations in this disease implicate activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways in melanoma. While the detection of activating BRAF, NRAS, and KIT mutations is relatively standardized, evaluation of PTEN, a tumor suppressor that inhibits the PI3K-AKT pathway, is challenging due to its regulation by epigenetic mechanisms. In order to understand the molecular correlates of PTEN expression in clinical specimens, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for PTEN in a CLIA-certified laboratory at the MD Anderson Cancer Center on a cohort of FFPE melanomas with mutational and proteomic data from frozen tissue from the same tumors. The expression of PTEN in the tumor tissue was compared to staining intensity in internal positive controls (i.e. endothelial cells), and was scored as Absent, Markedly Reduced, Mildly Reduced, or Normal/Increased. In a cohort of 93 tumors, Absent PTEN expression was observed in 21%, Markedly Reduced in 23%, Mildly Reduced in 36%, and Normal/Increased in 18%.

Absent PTEN expression was detected in 38% of BRAF mutant, 0% of NRAS mutant, and 11% of Wild-type tumors. Quantitative proteomic data generated by reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis of the frozen tissue demonstrated that tumors with Absent PTEN by IHC had significantly lower PTEN (p<0.001), and higher levels of P-AKT Thr308 (p=0.004), P-AKT Ser473 (p=0.008) and P-P70S6K (p=0.01) than tumors with Reduced/Normal/Increased PTEN expression, consistent with increased activation of the downstream signaling by the PI3K-AKT pathway. In contrast, tumors with Markedly Reduced PTEN had lower levels of PTEN expression by RPPA than the Mildly Reduced and Normal/Increased PTEN tumors (p=0.046) but they did not exhibit significant differences in P-AKT or P-P70S6K.

It is the most common and fatal skin cancer, with an incidence that is critically increasing in Western populations (15 times in the last 40 years) and for which, in the advanced stages, there is no effective therapy. The search for new compounds able to control it is therefore essential. The hydroxylated biphenyl compound (3E,3E)-4,4-(5,5,6,6-tetramethoxy-[1,1-biphenyl]-3,3-diyl)bis(but-3-en-2-one), namely D6, a structural analogue of curcumin, showed a strong antitumor activity on MM cells both in vitro and in vivo, as we have recently described [1]. The mechanisms of action of this compound are not clear yet, but it inhibits cancer cells growth by inducing apoptosis without affecting normal fibroblasts growth. Firstly we investigated the ability of D6 to enter cells by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. The LC-MS data showed a quick cellular uptake of D6 with a maximum peak after about 2 hours. To investigate on the effects of D6 treatment on the cell cycle progression in MM cells, we performed flow cytometry analysis, which evidenced a cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Gene expression profiles analysis using Illumina high-density microarrays, was carried out on D6 treated MM cells and normal fibroblasts allowing the identification of 599 transcripts whose expression was modulated by D6 treatment in MM cells but not in normal fibroblast. The analysis of results, performed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software, showed the centrality of CDKN1A gene, encoding p21, a major negative cell cycle regulator, which was strongly over expressed, while cyclin B and cdc25 phosphatase, showed both to be down modulated. Other genes which expression interestingly appeared to be decreased by D6 activity were the oncogenes c-kit and PI3K, suggesting a down regulation of both c-kit mediated and PI3K/AKT signal transduction pathways driving to cell proliferation. Modulation of expression of these specific genes has been confirmed at a protein level by western blotting analysis. Moreover our results pointed out an upregulation of several heat shock family genes, which is probably due to a curcumin related anti inflammatory effect of D6. The preliminary results of these analysis show that D6 induces molecular changes in MM cells at both gene expression and protein levels, involving major cell proliferation regulatory pathways.

It is now recognized that multiple signaling pathways that affect motility, growth control, invasion, metabolism, cytokine release and the ability to escape the immune response, regulate melanoma development. Silencing of SOCS-1 protein, a negative regulator of Jak/Stat pathway, leads to partial reversion of the tumorigenic phenotype of B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells. SOCS-1 silencing with shRNAi inhibits in vitro growth by cell cycle regulation with S phase arrest and increased size of cells and nuclei. It also inhibited tumor cell migration and invasion. Down-regulation of SOCS-1 decreased the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (mainly the phosphorylated-R), Ins-R, and fibroblast growth factor receptors. Based on the results of SOCS-1 silencing, the present work aims at analyzing the expression of proteins relevant to tumor development, searching for signaling pathways related with SOCS-1. A protein microarray analysis of murine melanoma cells silenced for SOCS-1 by shRNAi SOCS-1 lentivirus transduction was undertaken using as controls, cells transduced with the empty vector. Among the 614 differentially expressed genes some cytokine/growth factor receptors were down regulated, e.g. c-kit, met and EphA3. Western blotting of B16 shR-SOCS-1 cell extracts showed a significant decrease in the expression of these receptors, indicating that SOCS-1 positively regulates the MAPK pathways in these cells. We analyzed the main MAPK pathways that were up regulated in melanoma and observed a decrease in the phosphorylation of mediators of ERK1/2 and p38 pathways and of STAT3 (S727). These results demonstrate that SOCS-1 can play an important role in tumor development and progression up regulating a number of growth factor receptors in murine melanoma cells. Interestingly, p-CREB (S133) was up regulated in the SOCS-1-deficient B16F10-Nex2 cells. In vivo experiments showed that using a prophylactic protocol, the subcutaneous immunization of syngeneic mice with B16 shR-SOCS-1 viable cells, rendered a protective effect against subcutaneously grafted and metastatic murine melanoma, with significant reduction in tumor growth and metastates in the lungs. A flow cytometry assay showed decreased expression of PD-L1 at the surface of B16 shR-SOCS-1 cells. This might explain the protective effect of subcutaneous immunization with these cells, rather than with wild-type B16F10-Nex2 cells that overexpress PD-L1, which negatively regulates T-cell immune response. Down regulation of PD-L1 is compatible with inactive ERK. The present results show the important role of SOCS-1 in murine melanoma stimulating cell growth and migration, allowing for the invasive phenotype.']",

We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and complimentary RNA-seq of 23 tumor tissue samples from 21 patients. Six of these tumors were WT for BRAF and NRAS, so we studied these cases further. The SNV load in the WT samples is more variable than the BRAF or NRAS driven melanomas.

We identified the somatic mutations that are specifically enriched for double wild-type samples and observed that the top two hits, NF1 (30.2% in double WT vs. 5.7% otherwise) and KIT (15.8% in double WT vs. 0.8% otherwise) are known driver gene candidates for wild-type melanomas, but we also find other novel candidate driver genes. Thus, we present a framework for identification of driver mutations and therapeutic targets in double wild-type melanomas and integration of these types of data with other large datasets such as those derived from RNA-seq and RPPA will assist in the development of approaches to stratify double wild-type patients for targeted or immune-therapies.']",

However, recent developments in the exosome field have allowed biomarker research in biofluids to evolve.

        "Background":"['Background', ' The survival of patients with metastatic uveal melanoma remains poor; most patients ultimately die of hepatic metastasis. Tumor cell expression of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-1R) is a marker of poor prognosis in primary uveal melanoma. IGF-1 is produced mainly in the liver, which may account for the hepatic tropism of uveal melanoma. Therefore, we investigated the importance of IGF-1/IGF-1R interaction in hepatic metastases.Methods', ' The expression pattern of IGF-1R in hepatic metastases of uveal melanoma was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a series of archival samples from patients treated at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. To investigate the biological role of exogenous and endogenous IGF-1 on the growth of a uveal melanoma, a long-term, cell line obtained from a hepatic metastasis (TJU-UM001) was evaluated concurrently.Results', ' All 24 metastases stained positive by IGF-1R. Tumors showed 80-95% of cellular staining while adjacent normal liver showed negative staining. IGF-1R was expressed in both the cytoplasm and the exterior membrane of uveal melanoma cells. As previously reported (AACR 2010, Abstract #359), more than 90% of TJU-UM001 cells expressed IGF-1R on their surface and did so at approximately 1.2 x 104 IGF-1R per TJU-UM001 cell. The cell proliferation assay (Quick Cell Proliferation Assay Kit II; BioVision, Mountain View, CA) showed that quiescent TJU-UM001 was induced to proliferate by 2.6-fold (p<0.001) in response to exogenous IGF-1 at 300 ng/ml. Conversely, anti-IGF-1R antibody completely blocked the exogenous IGF-1-induced growth of TJU-UM001. IGF-1 preferentially induced phosphorylation of Akt (S473) in quiescent TJU-UM001 cells and this was blocked by anti-IGF-1R antibody. Cell proliferation kinetics analysis showed TJU-UM001 grows briskly in serum-free medium (SFM) and anti-IGF-1R antibody significantly inhibited growth. Correspondingly, TJU-UM001 maintained in SFM expressed mRNA for IGF-1 and furthermore secreted IGF-1 protein. Both anti-IGF-1 and anti-IGF-1R antibodies independently inhibited the spontaneous proliferation of the cells in SFM (p<0.05) suggesting a critical role for endogenous IGF-1 expressed by TJU-UM001 cells.Conclusion', ' Although the strong and extensive expression of IGF-1R in archival tissue specimens suggests paracrine stimulation via IGF-1R as a major mechanism of the growth of uveal melanoma in the liver, cell proliferation in SFM and the endogenous production of IGF-1 by tumor cells indicate an autocrine mechanism via IGF-1R is also operative. The results underscore a key role of IGF-1 in promoting the growth of uveal melanoma. The present study shows autocrine and paracrine mechanisms underlay IGF-1-induced uveal melanoma growth and indicate how these mechanisms can be targeted to suppress metastatic growth and improve clinical outcome.']",

Accounting for only 2-3%, carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) presents a challenge for clinicians in diagnosis and therapy. Tissue biopsy is the standard for diagnosis but there is need for improved methodology including a non-invasive blood test that may rely on CTC analysis. We have been developing a post-Veridex CTC analysis method using multiplexed Q-dot conjugated antibodies with the goal of detection of multiple markers in each single cell within a CTC population to aid in CUP diagnosis including tissue of origin. We have developed an immunofluorescence (IF) protocol with a minimal set of markers to predict the primary sites and provide prognostic information for common metastatic tumors', ' melanoma, lung, colorectal, upper gastrointestinal organs, and breast or prostate cancer. Two kits are available to isolate CTCs through Veridex CellSearch', \" melanoma kit (using melanoma antigen), and epithelial or carcinoma kit (using EpCam). A patient's blood is initially tested with both kits, and positive CTCs from the melanoma kit supports a diagnosis of melanoma, whereas positive CTCs from the epithelial kit supports carcinoma. For carcinomas, we use cytokeratin 7 (CK7), cytokeratin 20 (CK20), thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), estrogen receptor (ER) or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as the minimal set of markers. IF has been optimized in cultured tumor cells, first with individual antibodies, then quantum dots (Q-dot) conjugated multiplex quadra-antibody set. We evaluated antibodies by IF specific to these 5 markers in lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer cell lines. The CK7 and ER antibodies conjugated to Qdot 605 and 705 respectively demonstrated expression in the appropriate cell lines. CK7-Qdot 605 and ER-Qdot 705 expression in cells that were recovered after being spiked into normal blood samples and isolated by the Veridex CellSearch system was similar to that observed with unconjugated antibodies. Our data show that it is feasible to detect expression using Qdot-labeled multiplexed antibodies on tumor cells isolated from blood by Veridex CellSearch system. Successful application of this protocol to CTCs in patient samples is expected to provide a noninvasive, relatively quick and inexpensive blood test that can be both diagnostic and prognostic, which may be a valuable adjunct to routine biopsy.\"]",

Further studies determined that combinations of these drugs display a synergistic effect on SK-MEL-28 by inhibition of pS6 and pBAD and subsequent apoptosis. However, these effects are not observed in SK-MEL-2 cells; treated SK-MEL-2 cells show over-expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 suggestive of a rescue effect leading to lesser cytotoxic activity. The selective cytotoxicity observed in BRAF-mutated cells and not in wild type BRAF melanoma cell lines by both DT3 and simvastatin warrants further research into the potential therapeutic use of these combinations. This observation has added importance in the light of recent findings that show the acquisition of BRAF mutation is an early event in melanogenesis and hence these compounds may have a key role in chemoprevention approaches to melanoma.']",

Methods', ' This protocol utilizes a Simon 2-stage Minimax design, with a planned interim analysis to confirm >3 responders to move to the second stage. To date, 20 eligible patients have been enrolled with 17 evaluable for response.  All subjects were treatment nave and received paclitaxel  at 80mg/m2 weekly for three weeks in a 4 week cycle and pazopanib at 800mg as a continuous daily oral dose. The primary endpoint is 6 month progression free survival. Exploratory endpoints include biomarker analysis that may be associated with treatment outcomes (serum VEGF, soluble VEGF R2, serum HIF, serum TSP1 and BRAF mutation status). An additional exploratory endpoint includes the in vitro activity of pazopanib and paclitaxel on patient biopsy material co-cultured with vascular endothelial cells.  RECIST criteria were used to define treatment response. Results', ' For the 17 evaluable patients treated to date the following results were seen', ' 1 CR, 6 PRs, 8 SDs and 2 PDs. The overall RR (CR+PR) was 40%. Total disease control rate was 80% (PR+SD). The most common AEs/lab abnormalities were nausea (71%), hypertension (57%), fatigue (57%) and vomiting (43%). Grade 3-4 AEs included hypertension (28%), transaminitis (21%) and neutropenia (14%).  One patient discontinued for grade 4 transaminitis which subsequently resolved completely. Dose reductions were required for pazopanib in 5 patients and for paclitaxel in one patient. Conclusions', ' Planned interim analysis of this phase II study demonstrated that pazopanib in combination with paclitaxel was well tolerated and resulted in a 40% response rate, indicating that this combination is of further interest.

Metastatic melanoma patients have a poor prognosis; 5 year survival after diagnosis is only 15%. BRAF mutations are also found in lymphomas, colorectal, thyroid and lung cancers. This study was undertaken to develop reference materials for establishment of the lowest limits of detection for identification of the BRAF V600E mutation with the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation test, the THxIDTM BRAF kit, the Ion AmpliSeqTM Cancer Hotspot Panel.

Genomic DNA (gDNA) from fresh frozen tissue from 389 liver metastases and 6 primary tumors from 141 metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients as well as gDNA from 125 tumors from 75 malignant melanoma (MM) patients was available. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue from 285 of the CRC metastases from 123 patients were made. BRAF, exon 15 was amplified using the DyNazyme EXT polymerase system and sequenced by Sanger sequencing. IHC staining with the BRAF-VE1 antibody was performed on a Ventana BenchMark XT immunostainer. The intensity of staining was graded as 0 (no visible staining), grade 1 (weak diffuse background staining), 2 (moderate diffuse and granular) and 3 (strong granular staining). Grade 2 or 3 was regarded as positive. For high resolution melting analysis of V600-status, we used the LigthMix Kit BRAF V600E/K on a LightCycler 480 instrument.To establish the detection limits for the DNA-based methods used in this comparison, we analyzed a dilution series containing a ratio of 1', '1- 1', '107 BRAF V600E mutated DNA in BRAF wild-type DNA.

Tissue cytometry (or in situ cytometry) is a means of obtaining quantitative, per-cell, multi-marker antigen expression data from a tissue section. While determining the per-cell, multi-marker phenotype of samples containing whole cells has become a common, if not ubiquitous, part of flow cytometry and high-content screening, the same multi-marker analysis on samples such as solid tumors, bone or other solid tissues, which are not easily broken down into individual cells, are not easily performed. Immunohistochemical (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) methods have been developed for labeling such samples; however, in order to obtain quantitative multi-marker results from IHC and IF samples there are several challenges that must be overcome to give analogous tissue cytometry results. Methods', ' To address this, a tissue cytometry platform was developed that integrates', ' a) multiplexed immunofluorescence staining protocols; b) a multispectral imaging system (Vectra or Nuance) that to isolate IHC or IF marker signals from one another and, for IF, from tissue autofluorescence; and c) a new pattern-recognition-based image analysis package (inForm) for automatically performing morphologic segmentation and extracting data from cells-of-interest; and d) easy-to-use, optimized staining kits for panels of markers. For this study, a staining panel was developed targeting phosphoepitopes of AKT, ERK, and S6, using antibodies of three different isotypes, with secondaries conjugated to Alexa fluorophores (A488, A555, and A647). DAPI was used as a counterstain. Proof of principle of the suitability of the marker panel and imaging and analysis methods was done in cell lines, monitoring the down regulation of pS6 by a PI3 Kinase Inhibitor and the down regulation of pERK by a Raf inhibitor. Clinical samples pre- and post-case for treatment of a melanoma with a PIK3CA inhibitor were analyzed and both nuclear and cytoplasmic signal levels for all three markers obtained. Results', ' Results from cell lines matched expected down regulation. In the clinical samples, downregulation of pERK in melanoma was observed following treatment with the PLK3CA Kinase inhibitor. Conclusions', ' Tissue segmentation accuracy was estimated at greater than 90%, based on visual review by pathologists.

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of E7080 alone and in combination with PLX-4032 on tumor response, gene expression and tumor microvasculature in BRAFmu melanoma.  Methods', '  BRAF mutant (mu) cell lines were created by transfection of BRAF V600E constructs into BRAF wild type (wt) cell lines. Anti-tumor activity of E7080 alone or in combination with the selective BRAF inhibitor PLX-4032 was examined in xenografted models bearing mock and BRAFmu transfectants.  Results', '  The ratio of ANGPT1/2 expression was significantly higher in BRAFmu/ PTENwt compared to BRAFwt/PTENwt and BRAFmu/PTENmu among 14 melanoma cell lines. ANGPT1 expression was up-regulated in BRAFmu by 330%, and ANGPT2  in PTENmu by 290% compared to wt. PLX-4032 decreased ANGPT1 expression and pericyte coverage of tumor vessels in BRAFmu/PTENwt A375 melanoma. Similarly, overexpression of BRAF V600E in BRAFwt SK-MEL-2 melanoma resulted in increased ANGPT1 expression along with increased pericyte coverage. E7080 at 3, 10, 30 to 100 mg/kg showed significant anti-tumor activity against mock transfectants, but only at 100 mg/kg against BRAF V600E transfectants. Combination of E7080 at 10 mg/kg with PLX-4032 at 100 mg/kg showed synergistic anti-tumor activity against A375 melanoma and caused tumor regression, not observed by either single agent E7080 or PLX-4032. E7080 alone increased pericyte coverage of tumor vessels, but in combination with PLX-4032 resulted in marked decreased in pericyte coverage and microvessel density.  Conclusions', '  The BRAFmu/ PTENwt melanomas studied demonstrate high pericyte coverage and resistance to E7080.   Combination of E7080 with PLX-4032 achieves synergistic antitumor effect with enhanced reduction of pericyte coverage. These data provide a mechanistic basis for clinical study of BRAF inhibitors in combination with VEGFR and FGFR targeted agents.']",

Ipilimumab activates cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and enables them to destroy tumor cells. However, the molecular determinants of response to ipilimumab are unknown.  Methods', '   Fresh frozen tumor DNA (and matching blood) from 25 melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab was subjected to whole exome sequencing.  Exon capture was performed using the SureSelect Human All Exon 50MB kit (Agilent). Enriched exome libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq 2000 platform (Illumina) to a mean coverage of 103X.  Somatic mutations and candidate somatic neoantigens generated from these mutations were identified and characterized.  Results', '   Our cohort included complete responders (CR) and nonresponders (NR). Mutational burden ranged from 1-1121 mutations per tumor.  Mutational load was significantly associated with clinical response (p=0.028, CR vs. NR, Fishers Exact Test), but alone was not sufficient to predict response. Using genome-wide somatic neoepitope analysis, we defined candidate tumor neoantigens and identified a neoantigen landscape that is specifically present in tumors with complete responses to ipilimumab.  These somatic neoepitopes share consensus sequences with experimentally validated antigens from a variety of pathogens.  Furthermore, in four of six CR patients, a mutation led to the generation of a consensus amino acid sequence previously identified as necessary for T-cell recognition of melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART-1).  Conclusions', '   Somatic mutations and concomitant generation of neoepitopes in melanoma tumors confers enhanced antigenicity and response to the immune checkpoint modulator ipilimumab. Our study defines the neoantigen landscape in responders to ipilimumab, provides a rationale for examining the exomes of patients for whom ipilimumab is being considered, and builds a foundation for understanding the molecular determinants of response to cancer immunotherapy.']",

Methods', ' After extraction, tumor DNA of 118 tumors (44 metastatic tumors, 46 SSM, 11 ALM, 5 nodular, 2 Dubreuilh and 3 spitzoid) and 73 nevi (50 benign nevi, 18 dysplastic nevi and 5 spitzoid nevi) were sequenced using a panel of 15 genes (ALK, BRAF, CDKN2A, CTNNB1, GNA11, GNAQ, KIT, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NRAS, RAC1, RAF1, SF3B1, TERT and TP53) on a new generation sequencer (PGM Ion Torrent) using chips 318 with a depth > 51000x . The analysis of the variants was made by dedicated software (Ion Reporter, wAnnovar) and we selected only those which had a sufficient quality score. Results', ' The results of the sequencing showed the presence of very large number of mutations. In the begnin nevi, excepting BRAF mutations (V600E and V600K, present in 86%) there were no other mutations. At the opposite, the percentage of mutations in many other genes (ALK, KIT,CDKN2A,TP53...) in MM tumors range from 55% (Breslow < 1mm) to 90% in metastatic tumors. More than 80% of mutations were transitions C > T reflecting the UV-induced mutagenesis. Interestingly, in 33% of atypical and Spitz nevi, we also found at least one mutation in one of these genes (40% of these mutations were reported in Cosmic databases). Comparison of the proportion of somatic mutations between the different types of nevi, tumors with low thickness and metastatic tumors clearly showed an accumulation of somatic mutations during tumor development. Conclusions', ' This chip dedicated to MM is interesting', ' high sensitivity, allowing a better tumor classification and rapid identification of therapeutic targets. In addition, it could help for MM diagnosis in case of pigmented lesions with atypical component or uncertain diagnosis.

        "Background":"['FLT3 (FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3) and KIT are both members of the class III receptor tyrosine kinase family characterized by an autoinhibitory juxtamembrane (JM) domain that docks with the kinase domain to stabilize a catalytically inactive conformation. Therefore, mutations or deletions in this or in adjacent regions cause constitutive activation of these kinases as observed in 30% of AML patients for FLT3 and in 70% of adult GIST and a subset of melanoma patients for KIT.NMS-P088 is a member of a novel indazole sub-series, which selectively targets both FLT3 and KIT kinases, with different mutations, both primary and secondary, some of which involved in resistance to inhibitors clinically used to target these kinases, such as quizartinib for FLT3 and imatinib for KIT.The compound is able to arrest in vitro growth of human cell lines (AMLs and GISTs) which bear constitutively activated FLT3 or KIT, with IC50s in the low nanomolar range and with high selectivity towards cell lines, including AMLs, which are not dependent on these kinases. When tested against a panel of BA-F3 cells engineered to be driven by different FLT3 or KIT mutants, NMS-P088 compared favorably with reference compounds, both in vitro and in vivo. For example, comparative in vivo tumor inhibition values against BA-F3_FLT3-ITD(F691L) model were 85% for 15 mg/kg NMS-P088 vs. 14% for 40 mg/kg quizartinib.In vivo studies conducted on nude mice bearing the human MOLM-13 AML model revealed that repeated oral administration of NMS-P088 was able to significantly inhibit tumor growth and to increase survival time and that strong inhibition of FLT3 signaling is sustained for at least 48 h after a single treatment.Preclinical profiling of the compound showed a good oral bioavailability in all species, indicated a good therapeutic window in 7-day repeated toxicological studies in rat and in dog and excellent BBB penetration. The low myelotoxicity observed in exploratory toxicological studies suggests that NMS-P088 is potentially well-suited to combination with myelotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and this point is currently subject of preclinical evaluation. Furthermore, no adverse effects on cardiac parameters were observed in a canine telemetry study in which animals were exposed to Cmax levels several fold higher than those required for efficacy in the mouse.
