        "Background":"['Low grade gliomas (LGG) are the most common tumors of the central nervous system in children, accounting for about 50% of all brain tumors. They represent a heterogeneous group of grade I and II tumors according to the WHO classification. Pediatric LGG, is associated with activation of BRAF through a tandem duplication that results in the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion or through an activating point mutation of BRAF (predominantly V600E). More recent findings suggest that the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion is restricted to Grade 1 tumors (70-90%) whereas BRAF(V600E) occurs more frequently in Grade 2-4 tumors (~23%). Findings for BRAF mutation, similar to other tumors with activated BRAF (e.g. melanoma), and the phase I activity of MEK inhibitor in the PBTC-029 protocol, suggest that activated BRAF may provide a validated drug target. Previous studies from our lab indicate that, in the context of mutant BRAF, inhibition of MEK inhibits TORC1 signaling and may induce a ‘BRCA-like’ phenotype, through depletion of FANCD2. Potentially suppression of TORC1 could have effects on other DNA damage response pathways that could compensate for loss of FANCD2. To understand the consequences of MEK inhibition in the context of BRAF abreation in LGG we surveyed DNA repair genes that may be regulated via the MEK/TORC1 pathway in BRAF mutant cells. The objective of this particular study was to examine the mechanism and significance of MEK inhibition to the repair of DNA damage by the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. For this study, we have used glioma cell lines having BRAF(V600E) mutation; the BT40 cell line was developed from patient-derived astrocytoma xenograft (PDX) model in mice in our lab and AM38c1 and DBTRG-05MG cells were generously provided by T. Nicolades. Annexin binding assay demonstrated that MEKi treatment significantly increased the percentage of apoptosis and necrosis of glioma cells. Human DNA repair PCR Array analysis identified MEKi induced down regulation of genes involved in Base Excision Repair (BER), Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), Mismatch Repair (MMR) and Double-Strand Break (DSB) repair pathways. DSB repair genes were further validated by real time qPCR analysis. Immunoblot analysis of glioma cell lines indicate that MEKi treatment enhanced the gamma-H2AX levels. To elucidate the mechanism of DSB repair pathway in presence of MEKi, clonogenic assay, nuclear foci formation assay, and GFP reporter assay for homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) are ongoing. Collectively, these findings demonstrate for the first time a previously unknown role for MEKi in treatment of glioma cells that involves inhibition of DNA double-strand break repair pathways. Further, we will examine the mechanism and significance of MEK/ERK and TORC1 signaling axis in regulation of DNA repair genes and its effect on LGG. Understanding how MEK plays a role in DNA repair pathways will be useful in maximizing treatment opportunities for childhood glioma.']",

In this study a retrospective cohort of 198 pediatric low-grade gliomas (including 40 treated with adjuvant therapy) was analyzed for BRAF rearrangements, BRAF V600E, p16/CDKN2A deletion, p53 expression, and MIB1 proliferation index. In tumors with BRAF rearrangement, homozygous p16 deletion correlated with shorter PFS (P = 0.04). High MIB1 proliferation index strongly trended toward correlating with worse response to adjuvant therapy (P = 0.06). On multivariate analyses, the two most consistently powerful independent adverse prognostic markers were midline location (P = 0.0001) and p16 deletion (P = 0.03). Tumors with BRAF V600E had a strong trend toward an increased risk for progression (hazard ratio = 2.48, P = 0.07), whereas those with BRAF rearrangement had a milder trend toward reduced risk (hazard ratio = 0.54, P = 0.15). These data suggest that p16 deletion adversely impacts the outcomes of BRAF-driven gliomas; that high proliferation index may be a better marker of progression risk than BRAF; that BRAF rearrangement and BRAF V600E might not necessarily produce comparable outcomes; and that none of these markers is stronger than tumor location in determining prognosis in pediatric low-grade gliomas.']",

        "Background":"['Glioblastomas are a highly aggressive and detrimental brain tumor, comprising 50% of all human gliomas. Glioblastomas have a median survival of less than two years after diagnosis because it has a high capacity for proliferation and is extremely chemoresistant. A common molecular event that characterizes glioblastoma is constitutive activation of the RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling pathway. Activating mutation of BRAF (BRAF-V600E) has been reported in a subset of these tumors. We recently developed UI-152 as the new oncogenic BRAF targeting drug. In biochemical assays, UI-152 inhibited BRAF-V600E at very low nanomolar concentrations and showed a 10-fold higher potency against BRAF-V600E than another well-known oncogenic BRAF inhibitor, PLX4032/4720. In the present study, we evaluated the individual IC50 values of UI-152 from the cell growth inhibitory effects of the six malignant glioma cell lines with different BRAF mutational status. KG-1-C, NMC-G1, and DBTRG-05MG cell lines are heterozygous for BRAF-V600E; A-172, T98G, and U-87MG cell lines are homozygous for wild-type (WT) BRAF. The IC50 values of UI-152 were determined using crystal violet assays. UI-152 displayed the greatest level of selectivity for BRAF-mutant cells, inhibiting their proliferation more potently than that of cells expressing BRAF-WT. The IC50 of UI-152 in B-Raf mutant cells was less than 0.2 M, whereas the IC50 of cells expressing BRAF-WT were not reached even at 20 M UI-152. Corresponding immunoblot results showed that UI-152 completely abolished MEK-ERK phosphorylation in DBTRG-05MG cells harboring BRAF-V600E. However, in U-87MG cells expressing BRAF-WT, UI-152 caused the paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway. UI-152 induced the phosphorylation of MEK/ERK at 5 M but caused a return to control levels at 10 M in U-87MG cells. These results indicate that the genetic profile test of glioma is necessary prior to BRAF-targeted therapy to patients. Taken together, our data suggest that UI-152 may be an effective BRAF inhibitor and contribute to a potential therapeutic strategy for brain tumor patients with BRAF mutations.']",

BRAF-mutated PLGG had poorer long-term outcome when compared with wild-type (WT) cases. For BRAF mutant vs. WT PLGG 15-year progression free (PFS) was 76% and 6412%, respectively (p = 0.001) and 15-year overall survival (OS) was 5716% and 946%, respectively (p = 0.0001). Progression in the V600E mutant cohort was also frequent after both chemotherapy and radiation with 10 year PFS of only 29.511% and 31.012% respectively. Specific quantitative imaging analysis revealed response to chemotherapy in only 20% of BRAF-mutant PLGG.

Formation of orthotopic xenograft tumors was examined by direct implantation of 25 PLGG tumor cells into the matched locations in the brains of SCID mice followed by serial tumor sub-transplantations. In addition to histo-pathological characterizations, BRAF V600E mutation was validated with pyrosequencing, and CDKN2A deletion with FISH.Results', ' The yield of viable tumor cells was low. Neurosphere formation was absent in 10/11 PLGGs after 37.6  15.2 days.

Similar to the patient tumor, xenografts from this model (IC-3635PXA) exhibited low cell proliferation (Ki67+ cells <10%), medium microvessel density, homozygous CDKN2A deletion and relatively low abundance of CD133+ (<2%). The GFAP+ and CD15+ cells in xenografts, however, were slightly reduced while the vimentin positive cells dramatically increased from 50% to 100% compared to patient tumor.

CRAF fusions, like BRAF fusions are activating mutations driving the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Our previous findings suggest effective inhibition of BRAF fusion driven tumors using second-generation RAF inhibitor, PLX8394 and downstream MEK inhibitors (MEKi). We sought to investigate the mechanistic basis of response of CRAF fusions to clinically relevant RAF inhibitors and downstream pathway inhibitors, studying effect on CRAF dimerization profiles.METHODS', ' Heterologous cell model systems with stable expression of CRAF fusions were generated and used for testing downstream signaling pathways via immunoblotting. Soft agar assays and flank xenografts in immuno-compromised mice were used to characterize the oncogenic properties of CRAF fusions. Pathway activation and oncogenicity were further assessed in the presence of first - and second-generation RAF inhibitors, PLX4720 and PLX8394 respectively, MEKi, and mTOR inhibitors as single agents or in combination. Myc- and Flag-tagged constructs of CRAF fusions were used in co-immunoprecipitation assays to assess dimerization profiles of CRAF fusions with or without inhibitors.RESULTS', ' CRAF fusions activated the MAPK and PI3K pathways. CRAF fusions can homo-dimerize as well as hetero-dimerize with full-length BRAF, CRAF and the N-terminal fusion partner protein. Compared to BRAF fusions, CRAF fusions were not found to be responsive to any RAF inhibitors tested, including the paradox breaker PLX8394. We found that while PLX8394 decreased BRAF fusion-mediated dimerization, dimerization of CRAF fusion is unaffected. Clinically relevant MEKi AZD6244 and GSK1120212 both suppressed CRAF fusion driven pathways and growth in vitro but in mice flank xenografts, GSK1120212 partially inhibited CRAF fusion driven tumors. Since the CRAF fusions also activate the PI3K pathway, combinatorial targeting using MEKi and mTOR inhibitor, GSK1120212 and RAD001 respectively, was found to show robust tumor inhibition in vivo.CONCLUSIONS', ' This study demonstrates that CRAF fusions do not respond to RAF inhibitors, show partial response to single-agent MEKi, and respond robustly to combinatorial targeting of both MAPK and PI3K pathways via GSK1120212 and RAD001. Since PLX8394 does not affect CRAF fusion mediated dimerization, this provides a mechanistic basis for unresponsiveness to RAF inhibitors. Additionally, the N-terminal fusion partner also contributes to dimerization of CRAF fusions. Therefore, CRAF fusions are distinct from BRAF fusions in terms of responsiveness to targeted therapies due to dimerization profiles. These findings suggest molecular classification of PLGGs prior to treatment and provide preclinical rationale for combination therapy of CRAF fusion expressing PLGGs.']",

        "Background":"['Diffuse pediatric low-grade gliomas (PLGGs) are among the most common solid tumors in children. While BRAF mutations and MYBL1 rearrangements have recently been identified as diagnostic and treatment related oncogenic drivers in pediatric gangliogliomas and diffuse astrocytomas, respectively, for the majority of diffuse PLGGs the oncogenic driver(s) remain unknown. Recent efforts to identify new oncogenic drivers lack sufficient power to determine the true frequency of alterations in genes or to associate specific alterations with rare histological subtypes, such as Angiocentric gliomas (AGs). To address this issue, we performed genomic analysis of new and published data from 249 PLGGs including 19 AGs. We identified MYB-QKI fusions as a specific, recurrent, single candidate driver event in AGs. Although MYB is expressed during early brain development in a subset of progenitor cells, it is not known to play a role in normal cortical brain where AGs frequently occur. In vitro functional studies show MYB-QKI rearrangements promote tumorigenesis in mouse neural stem cells (mNSCs) through three mechanisms', ' MYB activation by truncation, enhancer translocation driving aberrant MYB-QKI expression, and hemizygous loss of the tumor suppressor QKI. Expression of the MYB-QKI fusion increases mNSC proliferation and activates known MYB target genes including KIT and CDK6. H3K27ac enhancer profiling of AG tumors demonstrate active enhancer elements are translocated proximally to the MYB promoter while in vitro promoter assays confirmed that QKI enhancer sequences activate the MYB promoter. Together with functional studies demonstrating that MYB-QKI can also bind and activate the MYB promoter, these data support a positive auto-regulatory feed-back loop model in which active MYB-QKI is able to drive its own expression through enhanced MYB-promoter-activation. Furthermore, when injected orthotopically into immunodeficient mice, expression of truncated MYB or MYB-QKI is sufficient to induce tumor formation that recapitulate histologic and immunophenotypic characteristics of AGs. Analysis of AG specific MYB-QKI fusion represents the first example of how a single driver rearrangement simultaneously transforms cells via three genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in a cancer.']",

Methods', '  After written consent, tumor and germline DNA were analyzed. Mutations were catalogued and compared to TCGA data. Comparison with other profiling methods, i.e. IHC (IDH-1 R132H mutation), RT-PCR (EGFRvIII), Sanger sequencing (IDH-1/2 mutations) and FISH (EGFR amplification, 1p/19q co-deletion) was performed. Participation in clinical trials was recorded.  Results', '  N = 104 pts were enrolled (48 glioblastomas, 39 grade III, 9 grade II and 3 grade I gliomas).

MSK-IMPACT identified all IDH1/2 mutations, including one IDH2 R172K in an IDH-1 R132H IHC-negative tumor. All pure oligodendrogliomas (N = 13) displayed 1p/19q codeletion on MSK-IMPACT. Three pts had 1p/19q codeletion on FISH but not on MSK-IMPACT, but mutational profile/ histology favored non-codeleted glioma, suggesting false-positive FISH results. All FISH EGFR amplifications were detected by MSK-IMPACT. Among EGFR amplified tumors, MSK-IMPACT disclosed EGFRvIII in 55%.

Separate studies have identified populations of neural stem and progenitor -like GBM cells, however the contribution of these cells types to tumor progression and the response to targeted therapy are poorly understood. Small molecules (such as vemurafenib) targeting the most common MAPK-activating mutation, BRAFV600E, are currently entering clinical trials for treatment of high-grade glioma. Understanding the contribution of different cell types to treatment responses will be necessary for the design of effective adjuvant therapeutic strategies.We show that activating MAPK pathway gene mutations in GBM correlate with elevated expression levels of oligodendrocyte precursor (OPC) and neural stem cell (NSC)-associated genes. Cells expressing CD133 and NG2 coexist in human GBM and BRafV600E expressing mouse neurosphere cultures, and maintain some of their respective neural stem and progenitor-like properties.In isogenic mouse cells expressing BRafV600E, NG2+ cells expand rapidly and symmetrically, while rates of asymmetric division are unaffected in slow-proliferating CD133+ cells. Tracing of proliferation rate with the membrane-associated dye PKH-26 reveals heterogeneity in the proliferation rate of CD133+ cells, but not proliferative NG2+ cells. BRAF-targeted inhibition of human GBM cells with PLX4720, the tool compound of vemurafenib, reduces S-phase entry of NG2+ cells, yet CD133+ cells are less affected. Interestingly targeted inhibition of components of the asymmetric division machinery selectively disrupts G2-M progression in CD133+ cells. The functionally divergent populations of CD133-expressing NSC-like cells will likely be therapeutically problematic with mono-therapeutic approaches. These data point to a differential regulation of key cell cycle processes between CD133+ stem-like cells and NG2+ OPC-like cells, that will inform the intelligent design of compound treatment strategies.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

We and others have shown that mutations in genes encoding for histone 3.3 (H3F3A), histone 3.2 (HIST2H3C) and histone 3.1 (HIST1H3B) along with their obligate partner mutations are the major driver mutations in DIPGs. Where recent studies have identified major histone partner mutations associated with DIPGs, more research is required to provide a clear landscape of genomic aberrations associated with thalamic tumors. We hypothesize that comprehensive whole genome sequence, methylation and proteome analysis of a large cohort of thalamic tumors will map differentially regulated pathways and identify potential novel driver and obligate partner mutations associated with thalamic gliomas. We have established a cohort (CNHS and CBTTC) of 128 thalamic specimens, including 56 pediatric and adolescent primary thalamic tumors with median age at diagnosis of 5.6 years (range 0-20 years); 40 normal controls with matched age and gender; and 32 midline tumors with potential thalamic involvement with median age at diagnosis of 7.6 years (range 0-19 years).

From our midline tumors with potential thalamic involvement, 22 (68.7%) were classified as primary DIPG and 10 (31.2%) were other midline gliomas. Where available, MRI reviews and histopathological analysis were performed. Preliminary results showed that 7 of the extended tumors presented hypercellularity and positive histone 3 K27M staining, confirming that these tumors in fact extended to the thalamus as MRI showed.

        "Meeting_name":" Recurrent FGFR1 hotspot mutations represent a novel therapeutic target in childhood astrocytoma.",
        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is the most common childhood brain tumor. This tumor can occur throughout the central nervous system, with roughly 50% of cases arising outside of the cerebellum. Tumors in these non-cerebellar locations are often difficult to treat surgically, leading to multiple tumor recurrences. PA can therefore become a chronic disease, with patients experiencing substantial morbidities. Alterations in the MAPK pathway, particularly BRAF, have previously been identified in 80% of PAs. Interestingly, however, the majority of those cases without a recognized change are non-cerebellar.Methods', ' To investigate the full range of genetic alterations occurring in PA, we used Illumina HiSeq technologies to perform whole-genome sequencing of matched tumor and germline DNA from 47 patients, with corresponding RNA sequencing data for 35 tumors.Results', ' The average somatic mutation rate in PA was extremely low, at 0.065/Mb, with an average of only 1.8 non-synonymous coding single nucleotide variants (SNVs) per tumor - almost ten times lower than we have recently reported for medulloblastoma. We found several novel alterations in known PA-related genes, including two new oncogenic BRAF fusions. Most strikingly, however, we identified mutations at two hotspots in the FGFR1 receptor tyrosine kinase in 4/6 centrally located PAs lacking any other MAPK pathway change. Two of these cases also carried a mutation in a downstream adaptor protein, PTPN11 (Shp2). Interestingly, germline mutations of PTPN11 are associated with Noonan syndrome (NS), and there are case reports of NS patients developing PAs. Screening of additional non-cerebellar PAs revealed four further cases with an FGFR1 mutation. All PAs, regardless of MAPK pathway alteration, displayed highly elevated expression of FGF2, indicating a general role for ligand-mediated activation of the FGFR1/MAPK pathway in PA tumorigenesis. Notably, the same FGFR1 mutations were also identified in four midline pediatric glioblastomas (GBM), a highly malignant brain tumor, suggesting a possible common origin for a subset of these two entities, despite their dramatically different clinical course.Conclusion', ' Altogether, MAPK alterations were identified in 96% of PAs, with very few other changes, confirming the concept of PA as a single-pathway disease. Our results also suggest that a subset of centrally located, FGFR1-driven pediatric PAs and GBMs may share common origins. Most importantly, they reveal a novel therapeutic target in clinically relevant subsets of childhood glioma.']",

        "Meeting_name":" Targeting hedgehog transcription factors GLI1 and GLI2 restores sensitivity to vemurafenib-resistant human melanoma cells",
        "Background":"['Melanoma represents the deadliest of all skin cancers being responsible for more than 75% of skin cancer-related deaths. Although the results with BRAF inhibitors have been very promising, practically all of the patients treated thus far have developed resistance to these drugs. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has been implicated in a variety of malignancies, including melanoma. However, there are no reports on the activation of this pathway in the setting of vemurafenib-resistance. Herein, we first identified that melanoma cell lines, with acquired in vitro-induced vemurafenib resistance, showed increased levels of Hh pathway component genes glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 and 2 (GLI1/GLI2) compared to nave cells. We also observed these findings in melanoma samples from patients. Moreover, the increased expression of the transcription factors GLI1/GLI2 was independent of canonical Hh signaling and was instead correlated with non-canonical Hh signaling, involving TGF/SMAD signaling. Knockdown of GLI1 and GLI2 restored the vemurafenib-resistant cells to sensitivity, an effect associated with both growth arrest and senescence. Treatment of vemurafenib-resistant cells with the GLI1/GLI2 inhibitor Gant61 led to decreased invasion of the melanoma cells in a 3D skin reconstruct model and was associated with a decrease in metalloproteinase (MMP2/MMP9) expression and microphtalmia transcription factor (MITF) upregulation. Our findings also demonstrated that GLI1/GLI2 modulation could be a useful strategy to prevent drug resistance. Alternating pre-treatment with vemurafenib and Gant61 significantly reduced IC50 of subsequent vemurafenib treatment in nave melanoma cells, demonstrating a promising approach for the control of vemurafenib-resistance in patients with unresectable melanoma. The modulation of vemurafenib chemosensitivity was triggered by GLI1/GLI2 repression during the acquisition of resistance, which did not occur in the treatment protocols with only vemurafenib continuously or in alternate days. The alternating treatment regimen with vemurafenib and Gant61 was able to suppress GLI expression, delaying or decreasing vemurafenib resistance. Taken together, our data demonstrated an unprecedented mechanism of vemurafenib resistance by GLI1/GLI2 upregulation, shedding light on the development of Hh pathway inhibitors as a promising strategy for melanoma treatment.']",

        "Background":"[\"Despite recent advances, clinically-relevant oncogenic drivers have not been identified in about half of lung adenocarcinormas. Here, we report rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR) amplification as a novel genetic abnormality in a young patient with non-small cell lung cancer. This male patient was a never smoker and was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinorma at the age of 18. He initially presented with refractory cough and persistent left lung lesions. Pathology was consistent with lung adenocarcinorma, poorly differentiated. Extensive molecular testing was negative for common genetic alterations in K-RAS, EGFR, ALK, HER2, RET, AKT, PIK3CA, BRAF and ROS1. His tumor was subsequently subjected to next generation DNA sequencing (FoundationOne, Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA) targeting a cohort of more than 180 cancer-related genes. This analysis identified rictor amplification of at least 6 copies as the sole DNA abnormality. Immunohistochemistry further documented rictor overexpression in the patient's lung tumor. The neoplastic lung tissue exhibited diffuse and strong cytoplasmic staining for rictor, compared to surrounding non-neoplastic tissues. Furthermore, the tumor tissue showed diffuse overexpression of phospho-S473 Akt, an essential downstream target of rictor.Rictor is a key component of mTORC2 complex, where it modifies actin cytoskeleton organization, cell proliferation and survival. Activation of rictor signaling has been suggested to play critical roles in regulating cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis in breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers and gliomas. To our knowledge, this is the first report of rictor amplification in lung cancer. Moreover, we found that blockade of the rictor-mTORC2 pathway by siRNA-mediated rictor knockdown or with pharmacological inhibitors led to decreased phosphorylation of S473-AKT and growth inhibition in lung cancer cell lines. Thus, rictor amplification may represent a potential novel target in lung cancer. We will perform further studies to determine whether rictor amplification is a unique molecular subtype of lung cancer. Further, we hope to identify which targeted drugs are active against tumors with rictor amplification and overexpression.\"]",

        "Background":"[\"Ovarian cancer is a biologically diverse tumor with heterogeneous molecular subtypes. Genetic mutations in various oncogenes have been previously identified in high grade serous ovarian cancer, including RB1, CDK12, BRAF, PI3KCA, and KRAS. To further investigate genetic variants, we screened 104 high grade serous ovarian cancer specimens for 2.855 hotspot regions of 50 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel. The panel contains 207 primer pairs in a single tube, using only 10ng of DNA to allow sequencing. Data analysis was performed via Ion Torrent software version 3.0, Nextgene software version 2.3.2, Excel and Medcalc.Our analysis resulted in the detection of 240 mutation variants. The most frequent mutation variants detected were in PDGFRA (91.35%), FGFR3 (90.38%), APC (86.54%), RET (82.69%), EGFR (74.04%), and TP53 (52.88%). When only COSMIC hotspot mutations were analyzed, genes with frequent mutations were APC (COSM19349; 91.35%),KDR (COSM149673; 56.7%), PDGFRA (COSM22413; 36.5%), KIT (COSM28026; 19.23%) and TP53 (COSM10704; 7.69%). The COSM19349 APC hot spot mutation results in a frameshift and has been described in colorectal cancer. The hotspot PDGFRA mutation (COSM22413) is a silent mutation that has been previously reported in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, gliomas and endometrial carcinoma. KDR (COSM149673) is a missense mutation that has been found in stomach cancer. KIT (COSM28026) is a missense mutation that has been confirmed as a somatic mutation in chordomas, hematologic malignancies and Merkel cell carcinoma. The TP53 (COSM10704) hotspot mutation has been found in many different tissues, including serous ovarian cancer, breast cancer and GI tract malignancies.We used the dbNSFP database (database for nonsynonymous SNPs' functional predictions) via Nextgene for functional prediction analysis using six algorithms (PolyPhen, SIFT, Mutation Taster, LRT and 1000 Genomes). Among the most frequent hotspot mutations, TP53 (COSM10704) was found to be damaging via all prediction tools.KIT (COSM28026) was found to be possibly damaging via PolyPhen.In summary, Ion Torrent sequencing revealed mutation variants in serous ovarian cancer that have not been previously identified. Further studies will be needed to analyze the functional and clinical importance of these variants.\"]",

        "Background":"['Background', \"There is a need for more accurate and sensitive methods to quantify nucleic acids present in precious samples and non-invasively collected liquid biopsy material. Digital PCR (dPCR) is one technology with recent advances in automation, enabling researchers to sensitively quantify a sample's nucleic acids by adding up digital fluorescent counts of single target molecules. Particularly exciting are the emerging uses of cell-free nucleic acids found in peripheral body fluids for dynamic measurements of total body mutational burden of heterogeneous cancers, potentially reducing the need for multiple invasive tumor biopsies. In addition, combined measurement of mRNA and miRNA RNA biomarkers from a single sample, for example from cell-free exosomes, is of clinical interest. Here we present results from several studies using dPCR for DNA and cDNA molecule counting with various cancers, as well as in a first time demonstration quantifying RNA directly with multiple miRNA species, and mRNA together with miRNA.Method & Results\", 'Picoliter droplet digital PCR was used to perform single molecule counting. Standard qPCR assay reagents for each target were combined in duplex or multiplex formats together with samples, and partitioned into millions of 5 picoliter-sized droplets on a RainDance RainDropTM dPCR system. Each sample was then thermal cycled prior to digital fluorescent quantification. In separate studies we show quantification of mutant IDH1 mRNA (cDNA converted) in glioma patient cerebrospinal fluid extracellular vesicles, PIK3CA mutations and methylation of CyclinB2 and Retinoic Acid Receptor promoters in breast tumor DNA, KRAS and BRAF mutations in colorectal cancer plasma cell-free DNA, and multiplexed miRNA biomarkers from plasma (cDNA converted). In addition, we show direct quantification of mRNA molecules in highly precise multiplex One-Step RT-dPCR measurements across a wide dynamic range. Finally, we show simultaneous One-Step RT dPCR direct digital counting of miRNA and mRNA molecules.Conclusion', 'Droplet digital PCR is a highly sensitive and precise approach to quantify nucleic acids without the need for standard curves. With the RainDance RainDrop dPCR platform there are sufficient partitions and compatibility with various robust chemistries to apply dPCR to DNA and RNA analyses from a variety of biofluids and neoplasms, enabling accurate absolute counting of multiple target molecules across a wide dynamic range.']",
