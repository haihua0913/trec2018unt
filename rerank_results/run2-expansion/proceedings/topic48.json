Here, we report that ectopic overexpression of c-kit in ACC cell lines is sufficient for acquisition of mesenchymal traits, enhanced cell invasion, along with stem cell properties defined by the presence of a CD133+/CD44+ cell subpopulation. c-kit positively regulated expression of known EMT inducers, also activating TGF-to contribute to EMT. c-kit itself was induced by TGF-in ACC cell lines and required for TGF--induced EMT. Xenograft experiments showed that c-kit cooperated with oncogenic Ras to promote tumorigenesis in vivo. Finally, in human specimens of ACC, we found that c-kit was abnormally overexpressed and correlated with the prognosis of ACC. Our findings define an important function for c-kit in ACC progression by orchestrating EMT, and they implicate this gene product as a marker of poor prognosis in this disease.']",

Salivary gland tumors are complex, due to their broad histological spectrum resulting from multiple tumor cell differentiation. We previously detected that the protein c-kit is involved in the process of salivary gland morphogenesis and tumorigenesis; other recent studies reported alterations in KIT gene in adenoid cystic carcinoma. The aim of the present study is to determine the expression of microRNAs targeting KIT in pleomorphic adenoma (PA) and adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), the most common benign and malignant salivary gland neoplasms, respectively, and that originate from the intercalated duct region. Material and Methods', ' Twenty-five pleomorphic adenoma, 14 adenoid cystic carcinoma and 10 non-neoplastic salivary gland samples were used and miRNA expression was evaluated by Real Time RT-PCR using TaqMan miRNA Assays (miR- 221 and 222). Results', ' Expression of miR-221 was detected in 13 CAC samples and 19 PA samples. In CAC, expression of miR-221 was downregulated in 4 out of 13 (30,77%) samples, upregulated in 4 out of 13 (30,77%) samples, and normal in 5 out of 13 (38,46%) samples. In PA, miR-221 expression was downregulated in 7 out of 19 (36,84%) samples, upregulated in 2 out of 19 (10,53%) samples, and normal in 10 out of 19 (52,63%) samples. Expression of miR-222 was detected in 14 CAC samples and 22 PA samples. In the majority of CAC samples, the expression of miR-222 was similar to that observed in non-neoplastic samples. In PA samples, expression of miR-222 was downregulated in 7 out of 22 (31,8%) samples, upregulated in 8 out of 22 (36,4%) samples, and normal in 7 out of 22 (31,8%) samples. Conclusion', ' The expression of miRNAs 221 and 222 do not present a definite pattern to discriminate PA from ACC.

        "Background":"['Proliferative disorders of mast cells exhibit a range of clinical behavior from benign cutaneous forms to aggressive systemic mastocytosis and mast cell leukemia. While these disorders are rare in people, they are among the most common malignancies in the dog, a circumstance that provides a useful model for an orphan disease. Growth of both normal and neoplastic mast cells is driven by c-kit (CD117), a tyrosine kinase receptor for stem cell factor. Ligand-independent, constitutive activation of c-kit via mutation is a common feature of mastocytic neoplasia. Therefore, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target c-kit have activity in aggressive mastocytosis in people and in dogs. However, resistance to c-kit targeted TKIs is common in both species, highlighting a need for other therapeutic targets.Our data indicates that chromatin modification may be important in mast cell biology. Specifically, we have shown that the JmjC domain lysine 36 specific histone H3 demethylase, NDY1/KDM2B, supports the proliferation and immortalization of bone-marrow derived mast cells. It is well known that NDY1/KDM2B is a driver of hematopoietic transformation and is associated with malignant progression in certain solid tumors (breast, pancreatic and urothelial carcinoma). Therefore, we investigated the effects of knockdown of NDY1/KDM2B in neoplastic human and canine mast cells in vitro and in xenografts. Our data demonstrate that this knockdown inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Therefore, targeting therapy of NDY1/KDM2B or downstream effectors in mast cell tumors could be a beneficial addition to the existing therapeutic modalities.Supported by grants from the Morris Animal Foundation (D14CA) and NIH (R01CA109747).']",

        "Background":"['Cancer stem cells (CSC) are a rare subpopulation of undifferentiated cells that are responsible for tumor initiation and tumor regeneration after chemotherapy. Although a universal marker for CSCs has not been identified, previous studies showed that c-kit (CD117) functioned as a stem cell factor (SCF) receptor, and SCF-ckit signaling axis was essential for self-renewal and proliferation of lung CSCs. During tumorigenesis, subsets of tumor cells disseminate from primary tumors by undergoing phenotypic changes that allow the cells to penetrate blood vessels. These changes are accompanied by a process described as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT endows epithelial cells with enhanced invasive potential by the loss of their epithelial characteristics and the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype. The aim of this study is to correlate c-kit-positive CSCs and EMT-positive, subpopulations of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with clinicopathological parameters to verify whether these biomarkers contribute to cancer distant metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 31 patients with NSCLC were enrolled into this study and evaluated for CTC levels at baseline. Peripheral blood samples (5 ml, anticoagulated with EDTA) were collected, transferred to the CanPatrol CTC tube, and then processed within 8 hours. The CanPatrol CTC enrichment technique was used to isolate and characterize CTCs. The first step of this technique was to isolate CTCs via a filter-based method; then, an quantifiable, quadruple-colorimetric RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) method was used to examine CTCs for expression of four epithelial (E) biomarkers (cytokeratins (CKs)8,18 and 19; and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)), two mesenchymal (M) biomarkers (vimentin and twist), c-kit and CD45. Using this technique, CTCs were detected in 25(80.6%) of 31 blood samples, and five categories of CTCs were defined using EMT biomarkers ranging from exclusively epithelial (E) to intermediate (E > M, E = M, M > E) and exclusively mesenchymal (M). Of the CTC-positive samples, 13(52%) samples contained c-kit-positive CTCs, and the percentage of cells with c-kit expression was 27.8%, with 2.1%, 4.6%, 2.1%, 18.3% and 0.8% in exclusively E, E > M, E = M, M > E and exclusively M CTCs, respectively. The expression of c-kit showed a high statistically significant correlation with distant metastasis (P = 0.0001). Compared with the non metastatic or regional metastatic carcinoma, mesenchymal CTCs (including M > E and exclusively M) were predominant in patients with distant metastatic carcinoma (P = 0.033). However, the sample size of this study was small, further validation needed to be done with a larger sample size. In summary, mesenchymal CTCs or/and c-kit may be potential predictive factors for invasion and metastatic spread of NSCLC.']",

        "Background":"['In many human cancers, expression or activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) c-kit is often associated with increased malignancy. In prostate cancer (PCa), we reported an association between expression of c-kit and clinical progression, with the highest expression seen in castrate-resistant metastatic bone specimens. We also found de novo c-kit expression in experimental intraosseous tumors formed by otherwise c-kit negative PCa cells. However, the biological consequences of c-kit expression and activation in PCa cells remain unknown. Here, we show that c-kit overexpression in PC3 and C4-2B PCa cells significantly enhances their migratory and invasive ability in vitro. Consistent with this result, we found that expression and activation of c-kit in PCa cells decreased the expression of E-cadherin and increased the expression of vimentin, suggesting an epithelial mesenchymal transition-like phenomenon. Furthermore, activation by c-kit ligand in PC3 and C4-2B cells transfected with c-kit lead to phosphorylation of Akt. This contributes to the enhanced invasiveness of c-kit-expressing PCa cells, as demonstrated by an inhibitory effect by PI3K/Akt inhibitors LY294002 and Wortmannin. In an attempt to identify genes differentially expressed in c-kit-expressing and -non-expressing PCa cells, we used a microarray containing 84 genes, representing growth factor receptors, transcription factors, cell cycle, and DNA repair genes. The analysis of the array demonstrated a consistent down-regulation of Brca2 in both c-kit-expressing PC3 and C4-2B cells, further validated by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting. Re-introduction of Brca2 into c-kit-expressing PCa cells suppressed c-kit-enhanced invasiveness to levels similar to those shown by c-kit-non-expressing cells, and led to reduced phosphorylation of Akt. Our results provide evidence that c-kit expression in PCa cells, an event which is induced upon interaction with the bone microenvironment, promotes tumor migration and invasion through an Akt-dependent mechanism regulated by Brca2 down-regulation. The identification of this novel signaling axis and its importance in PCa migration and invasion reveal potential therapeutic targets for regulating the expansion of PCa metastatic lesions in bone.']",

        "Background":"['c-Kit is an attractive target for the treatment of a variety of solid tumors [gastrointestinal tumors (GIST), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), melanoma] and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) due to its role as an oncogenic driver and high level of expression. Several targeted therapies, such as imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib, bind to c-Kit and are approved for clinical use. However, due to their insufficient activity on cancers expressing wildtype c-Kit or insensitive forms of mutant c-Kit, the clinical response has been quite varied. Moreover, despite initial anti-cancer benefits in c-Kit mutant settings (such as in GIST), resistance to c-Kit inhibitor therapies emerges due primarily to the development of additional mutations in c-Kit.In an attempt to broaden the treatment of patients whose cancers express c-Kit (wildtype and mutant) and to enhance potency with comparable or better tolerability than the current therapeutics, we developed a c-Kit-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that disrupts tumor growth through anti-mitotic activity. Hybridomas from mice immunized with the c-Kit extracellular domain (ECD) were screened for selective c-Kit binding and degradation. A humanized lead antibody (Ab) was identified, which rapidly internalized upon binding cell-surface c-Kit, but did not block binding to the c-Kit ligand (SCF). The Ab exhibited minimal-to-no cytotoxicity against c-Kit+ cell lines in vitro. To generate cytotoxic activity and to potentially overcome resistance to current c-Kit-targeting therapies, the Ab was conjugated to the maytansinoid DM1, a powerful anti-tubulin agent, via a non-cleavable linker, SMCC (technology licensed from ImmunoGen, Inc.). The ADC demonstrated robust anti-proliferative activity against cell lines expressing mutant c-Kit (GIST) and wildtype c-Kit (SCLC, AML) in vitro. The ADC also demonstrated potent anti-cancer activity in GIST and SCLC tumor xenograft models in vivo.In summary, the anti-c-Kit ADC is highly selective and active against cancers with elevated c-Kit expression regardless of their mutational status, thus representing a promising novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of c-Kit+ solid tumors, such as GIST and SCLC, as well as hematological malignancies such as AML and aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM).']",

        "Background":"['MITF, the master regulator of melanocytes, is a basic basic- helix- loop-helix- leucine zipper transcription factor that is essential for the development of melanocytes. MITF is also a lineage- survival oncogene in melanoma and recently, it has been shown that germline mutations in MITF predispose to this malignant disease. In melanoma, MITF has been proposed to act as a rheostat where high levels of MITF contribute to a proliferative phenotype whereas low levels result in a more invasive phenotype. The biological output generated by high or low levels of MITF is well characterized. However, how the activity of MITF is regulated to mediate these effects is less well known. It has been proposed that MITF is phosphorylated upon ligand induced activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase c- KIT. C-KIT engages the MAP kinase signaling cascade where ERK2 directly phosphorylates Ser73 of MITF and P90RSK phosphorylates the Ser409 residue of MITF. As a consequence, MITF activity increases and the protein is subjected to ubiquitin dependent degradation.Here, we show for the first time that c-KIT induces phosphorylation of MITF through the survival PI3 kinase- AKT pathway, the P38 stress pathway as well as the well-known MAP kinase-ERK signaling pathway. In addition, we show that the SRC kinase upstream of ERK is essential for c-KIT induced MITF activation. Moreover, we used several c-KIT phosphorylation site mutants to map the specific sites that are involved in the mediating transcription activation potential of MITF. These mutants also show less effects on MITF-mediated proliferation.We have generated phosphorylation specific antibodies against Ser73 and Ser409 of MITF and characterized the phosphorylation pattern of MITF using these reagents. Our results suggest that there is a particular relationship between Ser73 and Ser409 with subsequent effects on function. Based on our findings, we propose that phosphorylation of MITF might act as negative feedback mechanism that keeps MITF activity in check. Our model challenges the current knowledge of MITF modulation and provides insights that may have a profound impact on our understanding of the role of MITF in melanocyte and melanoma biology.']",

Here, to identify biological pathways that underlie HGS ovarian tumorigenesis, including the specific role of OCICs in that process, we performed integrated analyses of global gene expression, DNA copy number, and DNA methylation patterns. To that end, OCICs and bulk (i.e., disaggregated but unsorted) tumor cells were compared to primary human normal ovarian surface epithelial (nOSE) cells that, along with fallopian tube epithelial (FTE) cells, represent hypothesized cells-of-origin for HGS pelvic cancers. Principle components analysis and unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed distinct DNA methylation and gene expression profiles for replicate (n=3) samples of each cell type (i.e., OCIC, bulk tumor, and nOSE). Gene ontology and additional unsupervised analyses of gene expression signatures corresponding to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (82 of 159 signature genes), TGF-beta (47 of 86 genes), and Wnt (75 of 151 genes) pathways demonstrated well-defined segregation of the three cell types, with mesenchymal and Wnt signaling hierarchies being nOSE > OCIC > bulk tumor cells. To examine early events in HGS ovarian tumorigenesis, previously published (Tone et al., 2008, Clin Cancer Res 14', '4067) gene expression datasets were employed to show that nOSE, OCIC, and bulk ovarian tumor cell transcriptomes distinctly segregate from normal (FTE) and malignant fallopian epithelial transcriptomes. Interestingly, the largest divergence was between the nOSE and FTE gene expression profiles. Finally, DNA methylation and gene expression patterns were integrated, implicating specific networks/circuits in ovarian carcinogenesis. Taken together, these results support a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition during ovarian tumorigenesis, reveal legitimate therapeutic targets (at the pathway level), and raise uncertainty that surface epithelial cells of the fallopian tube and ovary are reciprocal cells-of-origin for HGS pelvic carcinomas.']",

The activation mechanism of the most often occurring mutation, D816V in exon 17 of c-Kit, has been well studied while other mutations remain fairly uncharacterized in this respect. In this study, we show that the constitutive activity of the exon 11 mutant V560D is weaker than the D816V mutant except that the phosphorylation of the Src family kinase binding site, Tyr568, is similar in both c-Kit mutants. The ligand for c-Kit, stem cell factor (SCF), induced phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins, such as Akt and Erk, in c-Kit/V560D expressing cells was stronger than that in c-Kit/D816V expressing cells. Although cells expressing c-Kit/V560D showed increased ligand-independent proliferation and survival compared to wild-type c-Kit expressing cells, these biological effects were less than c-Kit/D816V expressing cells. In contrast to cells expressing wild-type c-Kit, cells expressing c-Kit/V560D are independent of Src family kinases for downstream signaling. However, this independence of Src family kinases is not due to a Src-like kinase activity of the mutant receptor that c-Kit-D816V holds. Blockage of the association of PI3 kinase with c-Kit/V560D by point mutation, but not inhibition of PI3-kinase with pharmacological inhibitors, totally blocked ligand-independent activation of the receptor, suggesting a key role of the non-lipid kinase activity of PI3 kinase in c-Kit/V560D mediated oncogenic signal transduction. Thus, PI3 kinase is an attractive treatment target in c-Kit mutations induced malignancies independent of its lipid kinase activity.']",

As a control group, 202 patients with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 122 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs) were also analyzed. Using immunohistochemical staining (IHC), we stained all tumors with antibodies for 10 RTKs; c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET and ROS1. We scored the expression of these RTKs for all enrolled tumors, and compared them according to the histological types.Results', 'The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. Especially, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20% of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.Conclusions', 'Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs. The exclusive c-Kit positivity observed among HGNECs suggested that c-Kit might be a distinctive RTK in HGNEC.

Methods', ' The Proton Collaborative Group REG001-09 trial (NCT01255748) prospectively collects data for PBT patients with a variety of cancer types.

To explore the involvements of IDH1/2 in the pathogenesis in pediatric hematological malignancies. We analyzed mutations that involve the activation sites of IDH1/2 using polymerase chain reaction amplification/sequencing in a total of 244 samples of pediatric myeloid malignancies as well as infantile leukemia including 17 AML-derived cell lines, 115 primary cases of AML, 28 primary cases of MDS, 15 primary cases of juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), 6 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-derived cell line, 18 primary cases of CML and 45 infantile leukemia(6 AML and 39 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients). Moreover, to assess whetherIDH1/2 mutations overlap with known gene abnormalities, such as FLT3, c-KIT, and NPM1 mutations, mutational analyses of FLT3, c-KIT, and NPM1 were also performed. The common IDH2 R140Q mutation was detected in a single AML case, whereas no IDH1 mutation was detected in samples of myeloid malignancies. Although no IDH2 mutation was detected in infantile leukemias, novel P127S, H133I and I130V of IDH1 mutations were detected in 4 of 45 (8.9%) infantile ALL cases. No IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were detected in the JMML, MDS, or CML samples examined. Six AML samples including one cell line had c-KIT mutations (D816V, N822K, or D419fs), 12 AML cases had FLT3-ITD and 10 infantile leukemia cases had FLT3 mutations (D835E or I836). The NPM1 mutation was detected in 2 of 132 AML samples. The AML case harboring the IDH2 mutation, Case 39 was a 12-year-old boy diagnosed as AML-M2 according to the French-American-British cooperative group classification system having t(8;21)(q22;q22), showed no abnormalities of NPM1, c-KIT, and FLT3.

Curative treatment relies on surgery sometimes completed by radiotherapy. Management of non-surgical, locally advanced or metastatic tumors is difficult as conventional chemotherapies are ineffective. Directed therapies may provide important benefits for these patients. The aim of this work was to assess the expression and prognostic value of directed therapy targets on salivary gland tumors and search for mutations within the key players of the EGFR pathway.  Methods', '  Immunochemistry on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples from 124 patients for c-KIT, EGFR, c-ERBB2, MUC1, phospho-mTOR, androgen/estrogens/progesterone receptors and Ki67 was performed and related to progression free interval and survival. DNA was extracted from FFPE samples and conditional for treatment mutations of EGFR/KRAS/BRAF were assessed. An additional high throughput screening for mutations of key oncogenic genes was performed.  Results', '  EGFR was the most expressed marker, found across almost all histotypes. Expression of the other markers was heterogeneous but some potential therapy leads were suggested by high levels of C-ERBB2 and androgen receptors in salivary duct carcinomas or C-KIT over expression in myoepithetial carcinomas. Tumor grade and a high proliferation index (Ki67>20%) were associated with progression free interval and survival. None of the other marker was. No mutation was found in EGFR/KRAS/BRAF. 7% (7/104) of the tumors harbored a mutation at the codon 61 of HRAS. In epithelial and epithelial-myopithlial carcinoma, the mutation rate reached 33%. Mutations of PI3K and p53 were the most frequently found in the broader screen.  Conclusions', '  Several tumor subtypes expressed frequently some targets of directed therapies suggesting potential therapy leads. The EGFR/MAPK pathway seems intact suggesting a low efficacy of small kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib or gefitinib.

        "Background":"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematopoietic malignancy characterized by the clonal expansion and accumulation of immature blasts in the bone marrow. Several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including internal tandem duplication mutations of the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD) or mutations of the Proto-oncogene c-Kit (c-Kit N822K or D816V), are involved in the pathogenesis of AML. Another major point of resistance of leukemic cells to chemotherapy is their inability to activate cell death pathways, because of overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Mcl-1, Bcl-2...). In this study we worked on the antileukemic activity of 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a glycolysis and N-linked-glycosylation inhibitor, which have been described in different cancer models to sensitize to chemotherapy.First we evaluated the effects of 2-DG on cell proliferation and apoptosis. We showed that 2-DG inhibited more strongly cell proliferation of MV4-11, MOLM-14, Kasumi-1 and TF1 c-Kit D816V cell lines than U-937. In accordance with this result, 2-DG induced apoptosis in all AML cell lines previously cited excluding U-937. We also used the murine model BaF/3 stably transfected with FLT3-ITD, c-Kit D816V or BCR-ABL, and showed that cells transformed with a membrane tyrosine kinase were more sensitize to 2-DG than cell expressing the cytoplasmic oncogene BCR-ABL. Moreover, 2-DG induced apoptosis in primary FLT3-ITD AML samples (n=9) or c-Kit D816V mutated samples (n=5). At molecular level, 2-DG inhibited N-linked-glycosylation of FLT3-ITD and c-Kit mutants both in cell lines and primary AML samples, leading to a decrease of cell surface expression of these RTKs. We also showed that 2-DG overcomes the resistance to AC-220 in a MOLM-14 ITD/TKD model, by triggering the deglycosylation of the receptor. Furthermore, 2-DG exposure decreased ERK and STAT3/5 signaling but, surprisingly, not the AKT pathway in FLT3-ITD or c-Kit mutated models. Cell exposure to 2-DG and D-mannose, which restores N-linked-glycosylation but not glycolysis, demonstrated that 2-DG induced apoptosis and inhibition of RTKs cell surface expression are independent of the effects of 2-DG on glycolysis.In another part, we have demonstrated that 2-DG was able to decrease protein expression of the anti apoptotic protein mcl-1 in sensitive and resistant cells as well as in primary patient samples. These results correlated with the fact that in some cells, like lymphoma cells, mcl-1 synthesis is glycolysis-dependent. We took advantage of this decrease to associate the 2-DG with cytotoxic agents ABT-737 or cytarabine (Ara-C) and showed that these combinations (Ara-C+2-DG or ABT-737+2-DG) were synergistic.Our study shows that dual targeting of glycolysis and N-linked-glycosylation is an attractive therapeutic strategy in acute myeloid leukemia.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

In mucoepidermoid carcinoma, the MECT1-MAML2 fusion. In adenoid cystic carcinoma, either a MYB-NFIB or MYBL1-NFIB fusion. We identified collection and processing methods to be tested on healthy individuals’ saliva samples. We compared three saliva stimulation methods', ' Chewing Gum, Tabasco and Vitamin C powder with unstimulated collected saliva; and also utilized different processing and RNA extraction procedures', ' Trizol based', ' QIAzol method (Qiagen), RNEasy saliva protecting reagent (Qiagen), OrageneRNA (DNA Genotek), and mirVana Kit (ThermoFisher). We evaluated the RNA´s quantity and quality with Spectrophotometer and Agilent’s 2100 Bio analyzer. We identified two salivary gland specifically highly expressed genes (HTN3 and CA6) to be analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. We have collected and processed 221 samples and analysis is ongoing. Bio analyzer showed that RNA from the unstimulated collected saliva has a higher concentration than stimulated saliva. Unstimulated saliva is expected to contain mucosa cells, bacteria and rests of food, therefore those could also be RNA sources. When saliva’s RNA is protected by either of the buffers tested, the RIN scores (RNA Integrity Number) obtained by Bio analyzer are higher. Based on our preliminary data, stimulation with either Tabasco, Chewing Gum or Vitamin C followed by RNA stabilization with the OrageneRNA kit and extraction with Trizol resulted in the highest quality and specificity of the RNA for its salivary gland origin. Unstimulated collection followed by the same processing generates a greater RNA yield. This saliva RNA is likely contaminated with RNA form squamous cells, bacteria and food residues, which may decrease the sensitivity of the specific gene expression of HTN3 and CA6. Once established how to best collect and protect saliva for the extraction of nucleic acids originated from the salivary glands, we anticipate accelerating the path to clinically highly demanded kits for the surveillance of salivary gland cancer patients. We plan to prospectively collect samples from Salivary gland tumor patients with the chosen method and evaluate tumor related markers.

Tandutinib is a novel quinazoline-based inhibitor of the type III receptor tyrosine kinases including c-Kit and PDGFR. The current study is designed to determine the effect of tandutinib on colon cancer growth and identified a mechanism of action.Method', ' Colon cancer cell lines HCT116, HT-29 and SW480 and normal colon epithelial cells were used in the study. Cell growth was measured by hexoseaminidase and clonogenicity assays. Apoptosis was determined by measuring caspase 3/7 activities. Cell cycle analysis was measured by Flow cytometry. Signaling proteins were quantified by western blot analysis. For in vivo effects, HCT116 xenografts were developed in the flanks of nude mice. Immunohistochemistry was performed for CD31 and Akt/mTOR signaling proteins.Results', ' Tandutinib treatment resulted in a dose and time dependent inhibition of proliferation and colony formation in all three cell lines but did not affect normal colonic epithelial cells. Treatment also induced colon cancer cells to undergo apoptosis and G0/G1 arrest. Apoptosis was further confirmed by increased levels of activated caspase 3 and Bax/Bcl2 ratio, coupled with a reduction in cyclin D1. There was also a downregulation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-8 expression suggesting effects on cancer promoting genes. Moreover, tandutinib inhibited phosphorylation of c-Kit, Akt, mTOR, p70S6 Kinase and 4EBP1. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt1 overcame this inhibitory effect suggesting a critical role for this pathway. To determine the effect of tandutinib on tumor growth in vivo, nude mice harboring HCT116 tumor xenografts in their flanks were administered the compound intraperitoneally every day for 21 days. Tandutinib treatment significantly suppressed tumor xenograft growth, with notably lower tumor volume and weight. Microvessel density, based on CD31 staining was also significantly lower in the tumors following tandutinib treatment when compared to controls suggesting inhibition of angiogenesis. Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses demonstrated significant inhibition in the expression cancer promoting genes COX-2 and VEGF, and suppressed the activation of Akt/mTOR signaling proteins in the tandutinib-treated xenograft tissues.Conclusion', ' Together, these data suggest that tandutinib is a novel potent therapeutic agent that can target the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway to inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis.']",

Imatinib (Novartis Pharma) is a competitive inhibitor of BCR-ABL, KIT, PDGFRA, and PDGFRB tyrosine kinases.

Toxicity was graded according to the CTC of the NCI, version 3.0. 15 patients with advanced TETs (most of them B2 or B3 thymoma, some of them with a squamous component) , who had been pretreated with at least one chemotherapeutic agent, were enrolled at the Department of Molecular and Clinical Oncology and Endocrinology of University Federico II of Naples from March, 2008 to July 2010. Results', '  One third of patients presented with thymic carcinomas. C-Kit was expressed only in some cases of TC, as revealed by immunohistochemistry. No mutations in the C-kit gene (exons 9-11-13 and 17) were found in the TC cases by mutational analysis.  Imatinib was overall well tolerated, with no toxicity-related death. Diarrhea and migraine were the most frequent events, occurring both in 20% of patients, but were manageable and mild. No radiographic responses were recorded. Median progression-free survival was 3 months (range, 2.75-4). Median overall survival was not reached. Conclusions', '  The study was terminated before it reached its target accrual of 42 patients, because of the lack of responses and low accrual rate.

        "Background":"['Background; Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is known to originate from the interstitial cells of Cajal or its precursors with an activating mutation in the c-kit gene. On the other hand, it has been shown that micro GIST with c-kit mutation was commonly found in stomach resected for gastric cancer or in autopsy specimens. It seems that c-kit mutation initiates GIST and other genetic or epigenetic changes occur in the developmental process of GIST. In this study, we compared gene expression profiles among gastric and intestinal GIST as well as their metastatic liver tumors to identify the genes involved in the process of malignant transformation of GIST.Methods; Fresh frozen samples of primary gastric and intestinal GISTs and metastatic liver GISTs were used in the analysis. Total RNA was extracted and gene expression levels were compared by microarray analysis between 3 primary gastric GISTs and 4 metastatic liver GISTs, and among 6 primary gastric GISTs,3 primary intestinal GISTs and 6 metastatic liver GISTs. Protein levels of versican and CD9 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 104 primary gastric GISTs and13 metastatic liver GISTs.Results; Expression levels were higher for 165 genes and lower for 146 genes in metastatic liver GIST compared with primary gastric GIST. Among them, we further focused on two genes; versican and CD9, mRNA levels of which were higher and lower, respectively, in the metastatic liver GIST. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that protein levels of versican and CD9 were higher and lower, respectively, in metastatic liver tumors compared with primary gastricGIST. High expression of versican and loss of CD9 expression correlated with shorter liver metastasis-free survival after gastrectomy. Microarray analysis of primary gastric and intestinal GISTs and metastatic liver GIST classified them into two groups according their gene expressions. One group consisted of primary gastric GIST without postoperative recurrence and the other consisted of clinically malignant GIST, intestinal GIST and metastatic liver GIST. These data suggest that intestinal GIST, regardless of presence of metastasis, shows gene expression profile similar to clinically malignant GIST and further to metastatic tumors and may explain mechanisms by which intestinal GISTs are more likely to show clinically malignant phenotype than gastric GISTs.Conclusions', ' Gene expression profile of primary intestinal GIST was similar to that in metastatic liver GIST but not to that in primary gastric GIST. Versican and CD9 could be potential prognostic markers of gastric GIST with which to predict the risk of postoperative liver metastasis.Citation Format', ' Hirotoshi Kikuchi, Tomohiko Setoguchi, Shinichiro Miyazaki, Ichirota Iino, Yoshihiro Hiramatsu, Kinji Kamiya, Manabu Ohta, Takanori Sakaguchi, Hiroyuki Konno.

        "Background":"['Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) express distinct surface markers and have unique functional properties that distinguish them from the rest of the cells in a tumour. There have been variability in the identity of CSC markers in serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary. We have taken a composite approach for evaluating surface markers together with functional assays in primary tumours (n = 20). Expression of CSC markers were evaluated by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence (IF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in cell lines (n = 8), primary malignant cells (PMC, n = 20) and normal ovary (n = 2). The ALDEFLUOR assay was used to identify CSCs individually (n = 20) and together with surface markers (n = 6). PMC (n = 5) were grown as spheroids to evaluate expression of markers and ALDEFLUOR assay (n = 3). The role of signaling by Notch, Wnt and Hedgehog pathways were evaluated to ascertain maintenance of CSCs in the spheroid model (n = 3) using specific small molecule inhibitors. PMC (n = 20) were grown in the presence or absence of inhibitors for 2 weeks and CSC markers evaluated to ascertain specificity of effect along with motility assays. We identified 3 novel surface markers in silico (CD9, CD24 and EPHA1) in addition to those previously detected (CD133, CD117, CD44). The surface markers CD117 and CD9 were expressed in ovarian surface epithelium. CD117, CD9 and ALDH1A1 also showed expression in the fallopian tube by IHC. PMC expressed individually CD44 (57.73.2), CD117 (12.56.1), CD133 (09.73.9), CD9 (11.17.2), CD24 (34.64.9), Epha1 (16.43.1) by flow cytometry. Co expression of markers in the same cells (n = 20) were (11.335.32). PMC expressed ALDH1A1 (2.50.2) and a fraction of these cells co-expressed CSC surface markers (2.09  0.08). ALDH1A1 expressing malignant cells (n = 5) were predominantly in G0/G1 phase (67.22.6) of the cell cycle. Spheroids expressed all the above CSC markers by IF. In addition, ALDH1A1 was expressed in spheroids suggesting that these are enriched for CSCs. Spheroid formation in OVCAR3 and UC1101 cells was inhibited completely by the Hedgehog pathway inhibitor (SMO) GDC0449 (3M). Flow cytometry analysis of PMC showed significant reduction in expression of ALDH1A1 (2.50.9), CD44 (18.65.5), CD9 (1.60.8), CD133 (0.50.3), CD117 (18.813.4), CD24 (0.10) after incubation with GDC0449. Similar results were obtained with two other inhibitors, LDE225 (SMO, 2.5nM) and GANT61 (Gli, 5M). Significant reduction in migration of PMC was observed in the scratch assay in the presence of inhibitors. These results demonstrate that ALDH1A1 expression is consistently low in PMC and is the most reliable marker for CSCs. There was wide variability of expression of the surface markers in PMC and none uniquely co-expressed with ALDH1A1. The hedgehog signaling pathway is important in maintaining the integrity of CSCs. Targeting components of this pathway may be an alternate approach for treating ovarian cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered a pivotal target for the eradication of liver cancer. CSCs have been identified by the use of various stem cell markers; however, it remains unclear how individual CSC markers are expressed in individual tumors. We hypothesized that the distinct marker-positive CSCs show unique features of tumorigenicity/metastasis and chemosensitivity which may reflect the heterogeneous nature of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry analyses were used to analyze 364 tumor specimens. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to isolate marker-positive HCC cells, which were tested for hepatic stem/progenitor cell properties. CSC markers EpCAM and CD90 are independently expressed in primary liver cancer. EpCAM+ cells share features with tumorigenic epithelial stem cells, whereas CD90+ cells share those of metastatic vascular endothelial cells with expression of c-Kit. CD90+ cells facilitate metastasis of EpCAM+ cells through activation of TGF-beta signaling, and this effect is abolished by c-Kit inhibitor imatinib mesylate. These distinct tumorigenic/metastatic CSCs can evolve from marker-negative cells de novo, and their frequencies vary dramatically according to the genomic alterations and genotoxic stress. Our results suggest that liver CSCs are not a single, static entity but rather exist heterogeneously and undergo dynamic changes through genomic alteration and genotoxic stress. The evolution of CSCs explains the enrichment of CSCs in advanced cancer and the limitation of targeting marker-positive CSCs alone for tumor eradication.']",

Tumor Growth Factor- (TGF-) is a potent tumor suppressor via its SMAD2/3 signaling axis; its inactivation has been implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis. Paradoxically, TGF- serum concentrations are elevated in patients with advanced HCC. The TGF- receptor is currently explored in clinical trials as a therapeutic target. However, the mechanisms mediating the functional switch of the TGF- pathway to an oncogenic role in advanced HCC are unknown.Material and Methods', ' Gene expression profiling of human HCC was performed using the Oncomine database. Immunohistochemical analysis of human HCC samples was performed using Tissue Micro Arrays. Established human HCC cell lines were used for in vitro studies. Gene expression was assessed by qRT-PCR, ELISA and immunoblot analyses. shRNA was used for gene silencing. Cell cycle analysis was performed by FACS. Cell proliferation was assessed by microscopic quantification, MTS- and BrdU-assay. Apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL assay and DAPI. Migration was evaluated by wound assay, and invasion by Boyden Chamber assay.Results', ' In human HCC, SMAD2 overexpression and decreased expression of the negative TGF-/SMAD regulator SKI was correlated to shortened survival. Intranuclear pSer465/467-SMAD2 was identified in up to 65% of human HCC tumors, and correlated with TNM-stage, survival and pTyr705STAT3. In 50% of human HCC cell lines, the TGF-/SMAD2 axis was functional. Exclusively in HCC cells with intact SMAD-signaling, TGF- induced STAT3 Tyr705-phosporylation and nuclear translocation. We show that TGF-1 transcriptionally regulates expression of the c-KIT ligand Stem Cell Factor (SCF). SCF is overexpressed in advanced HCC tumors, and correlated to pSMAD2, metastases and decreased survival. In human HCC cells, SCF activates STAT3 via auto- and paracrine stimulation of its cognate receptor c-KIT. TGF-1-induced activation of STAT3 is inhibited by SCF-knockdown, inhibition of c-KIT or JAK1. The TGF-1/STAT3 axis neutralizes the cell cycle inhibitory function of TGF- in human HCC cell lines, and instead promotes EMT, tumor cell migration and invasion. Disruption of the TGF-/STAT3 signaling axis inhibits its tumor promoting effects and restores TGF- antiproliferative effects.Conclusion', ' In advanced HCC, TGF-/SMAD2-signaling is constitutively activated and correlated to worse outcomes. The functional switch of TGF- is mediated through aberrant expression of SCF with subsequent stimulation of the c-KIT/STAT3 signaling axis. Disruption of this axis restores TGF- tumor suppressor function.

        "Background":"[\"Cancer stem cells (CSC) are believed to contribute to the recurrent and often platinum resistant ovarian cancer (OvCa). Moreover, it has been suggested that some anticancer treatments result in an increased frequency of CSC relative to non-CSC. More recently, we have determined that the PARP inhibitor olaparib increased the frequency of CD133, CD117 and ALDH positive cells in the established serous OvCa cell lines OVCAR4 and CaOV4 and in primary cell lines derived from serous carcinomas obtained with IRB approval at the time of initial surgery. We also showed that olaparib treatment increased sphere forming capacity, expression of stemness genes and CSC proliferation suggesting that olaparib has the unintended effect of stimulating CSC function. Previous work has shown that the metabolic inhibitor CPI-613 preferentially targets ovarian CSCs due to their altered metabolism. Our objective here was to determine whether CPI-613 could negate the effect of olaparib on CSC function.OVCAR4 and CaOV4 cells were treated with 50 M CPI-613 and the relative frequency of CD133+ and CD177+ cells was assessed at 72 hours post treatment by flow cytometry with cell viability analyzed by MTT. Additionally, the sphere forming capacity of CPI-613 treated cells relative to that of vehicle treated cells was determined in an extreme limiting dilution assay. Finally, the expression of stemness genes in the CPI-613 treated and vehicle treated cells was evaluated by RT-PCR.Treatment of OVCAR4 and CaOV4 cells with CPI-613 decreased the frequency of CD133+ and CD117+ positive cells relative to untreated cells (p <0.001) without affecting cell viability. Additionally, sphere forming capacity was reduced in the CPI-613 treated cells. The decrease in both CD133+ and CD117+ cell frequency and sphere forming capacity suggests that CPI-613 is targeting the CSC population in these cells. Dual treatment with olaparib and CPI-613 blunted the increase in CD133+ and CD117+ cell frequency induced by single agent olaparib. Parallel treatment of CSC-rich spheres resulted in a considerable decrease in cell viability and frequency of CD133+ and CD117+ cellsClinical trials with olaparib in OvCa have resulted in increased progression free survival but no significant difference in overall survival has been observed. This raises the question of whether treatment with olaparib selects for the recurrence of more resistant disease, driven in part by the proliferation of CSCs. Our results suggest that CPI-613-mediated disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory pathway preferentially targets CSC and suppresses olaparib's effects on CSC function. In conclusion, targeting CSCs with non-traditional strategies could augment clinical outcomes and CPI-613 represents a promising candidate for combination with FDA approved olaparib treatment in OvCa.\"]",

        "Background":"['Prostatic carcinoma is most often a multifocal disease, with areas of localized, well-differentiated adenocarcinomas coexisting with poorly differentiated lesions within the same tumor. Mast cells (MC), classically known as the primary responders in allergic reactions, have been recently indicate of prognostic value in prostate cancer. We have evidence of a dual role of MC in prostate cancer. Within the same human tumor, MC are specifically enriched and degranulated in areas of adenocarcinoma, whereas few around anaplastic foci. This observation has been confirmed in tumors from TRAMP (Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate) mice, and in two novel tumor cells lines, derived from them, phenocopying well and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma', ' T1525 and T23, respectively. MC promote the growth of the well-differentiated adenocarcinoma T1525 that does not develop when transplanted into MC-deficient mice, or when MC degranulation is pharmacologically inhibited with sodium cromoglycate. In particular, mast cells are essential for the outgrowth of early-stage tumors due to their matrix metalloproteinase-9 production, become dispensable in advanced-stage, post-epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and are protective against neuroendocrine prostate tumor variants. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of MC in TRAMP mice results in early development of undifferentiated tumors characterized by marked anaplasia, suggesting that the growth of anaplastic clones may be antagonized by MC.Our data demonstrate that MC can influence the histotype of tumor arising from the prostate and that their targeting may change tumor outcome. As a possible corollary, MC depletion might favor the growth of more undifferentiated and aggressive variants. The common expression of c-Kit by mast cells and neuroendocrine clones suggests a possible competition for the ligand Stem Cell Factor and offers the chance of curing early-stage disease while preventing neuroendocrine tumors using c-Kit-targeted therapy.']",

Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) are used as targeted therapies for patients diagnosed with cancer with high expression of RTKs. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is highly expressed in bladder cancer as well other types of cancers and is one of the key proteins during tumorigenesis. In this study, we validated the effects of RTKIs, Masitinib (AB1010) and Axitinib on cell proliferation of human (UMUC-3 and T24) and canine (K9TCC#1Lillie, K9TCC#2Dakota, and K9TCC#5Lilly) bladder TCC cells. Using WB analysis, tested human and canine TCC cells, except T24 cells, expressed PDGFR and c-kit receptors. There was no detectable EGFR and VEGFR expressions in any of tested cells by WB analysis. The K9TCC#1Lillie and K9TCC#5Lilly cells had a high expression of COX-2, however K9TCC#2Dakota and human T24 had moderate expression of COX-2, and no COX-2 expression was detected in UMUC3 cells by WB analysis. Both RTKIs, Masitinib and Axitinib inhibited cell proliferation of the tested human and canine bladder TCC cells in a dose-dependent manner by MTS and apoptosis assays. Interestingly, both tested RTKIs, Masitinib and Axitinib increased COX-2 protein expressions in tested canine TCC cells. Combined treatment of RTKIs with COX-2 inhibitors decreased cell proliferation of tested TCC cells more effectively as either treatments alone. Our results indicate a possible role of COX-2 signaling pathway in developed RTKIs-resistance in bladder cancer cells in vitro.

Several inhibitors of HSP90 have been reported exhibiting more antitumor efficacy in PTEN-null tumor xenograft. The aim of our study was to evaluate the antitumor effects of a novel HSP90 inhibitor, NVP-AUY922, in human malignant cells, especially in PTEN-null cancer cells. Materials and Methods', ' Human esophageal cancer (TE-1, TE-4, TE-8, TE-10), gastric cancer (NUGC-3, NUGC-3/IL), pancreatic cancer (PANC-1, MIAPACA-2, Bxpc3) and mutant c-kit-driven lymphocytes (Ba/F3-KE11, Ba/F3-K642, Ba/F3-820Mz), mimicking gastrointestinal stromal tumor cells, were examined. WST assay and/or trypan blue exclusion assay were conducted to assess the anti-proliferation effects of NVP-AUY922 in those cells mentioned above. The activity of cell growth-related molecules such as AKT, ERK, and PTEN were investigated by western blot analysis. Genetic modification using siRNA and expression vector were applied for silencing and overexpression of PTEN, respectively, in cancer cells. Results', ' Cell viability assays showed that NVP-AUY922 potently inhibits the proliferation of human cancer cell lines, regardless of 5-FU resistance or c-Kit mutation, by which the sensitivity to imatinib can be affected. PTEN-null TE-4 cells exhibited more sensitivity to NVP-AUY922.

Furthermore, NVP-AUY922 significantly inhibited the activity of AKT and ERK in TE-4 cells, but not in TE-10 cells. Conclusion', ' Inhibition of Hsp90 function by NVP-AUY922 exhibited strong cytotoxicity against most of the cancer cells, including some anticancer drug-resistant cells, revealing its potential for a novel therapeutic alternative to cancer treatment.

Methods', ' The medical records of 73 patients (55 male, 18 female) patients treated with sunitinib between 2007 and 2010 at Poole and Bournemouth NHS Trusts, UK were reviewed. Patient demographics, length of treatment, response, RBC mean cell volume (MCV) indices, and known causes of macrocytosis including B12 and folate deficiency and hypothyroidism were examined. Results', ' Median duration of treatment was 6 months (range 0-30). 38 (51%) have died. 24 (32%) received 2 or less cycles of treatment with the majority stopping due to early progression or death. 30 patients (41%) developed macrocytosis on treatment, but a trend to macrocytosis was identified in most patients positively correlating to time on treatment. 26 (87%) had a macrocytic anaemia. Median time to onset of macrocytosis was 4 months (range 1-11 months). Of the 30 macrocytic patients; 5 were hypothyroid, 7 had untreated borderline hypothyroidism and 13 were euthryoid throughout. Of patients tested to date 1 patient was found to be serum folate deficient at 2.5 ug/L (3-17).

Further retrospective evaluation of other parameters such as red cell folate and reticulocyte count are currently being carried out. Conclusions', ' A significant proportion of patients on sunitinib (41%) develop macrocytosis. On the basis of this case series, the largest to date, underlying causes of macrocytosis (with or without anaemia) appear multifactorial. Biochemical hypothyrodism is common following sunitinib treatment and is likely to represent one of several possible contributing factors.

Addiction of melanoma to the MAPK pathways led to the development of inhibitors targeting either mutant BRAF, such as Vemurafenib (PLX4032), or MEK. Melanoma treatment recently met a breakthrough with the clinical evaluation of Vemurafenib that demonstrated an unprecedented 80% response rate among patients with BRAF V600E melanomas treated with Vemurafenib, but rapidly limited by drug resistance, which still requires to be elucidated.The MAPK pathway regulates the expression of many genes which can mediate therapeutic response but also resistance, such as RhoGTPases. We analysed the mRNA expression of the RhoGTPases in two BRAF mutated melanoma cell lines, WM266-4 and A375, in response to inhibition of the MAPK pathway by PLX4032. We observed that the mRNA of RhoB was increased by PLX4032 treatment. This result was confirmed in many other BRAF mutated melanoma cell lines by inhibition of the MAPK pathway with BRAF inhibitors (PLX4032 or SB-590885) as well as MEK inhibitors (AZD6244 or AS703026). MEK inhibitors (AZD6244 or AS703026) upregulate RhoB in BRAF wild-type melanoma cells harbouring N-Ras, K-Ras or c-KIT mutation suggesting that inhibiting MAPK pathway is critical for RhoB expression modulation. It is noteworthy that this modulation is cell type dependent, while it was not found in BRAF mutated non-melanoma cells as colon carcinoma cells (Colo205 and RKO).To investigate the role of RhoB induction in cellular responses to BRAF and MEK inhibitors, the RhoB induction was suppressed using RNA interference. The cells treated with siRNA targeting RhoB, WM266-4 and A375 cells, were more sensitive to PLX4032 and AZD6244. Moreover the blockade of RhoB induction led to a significant increase of PLX4032-induced apoptosis as shown by the increase of the subG1 population and PARP cleavage.Our findings show that RhoB upregulation is involved in PLX4032 response and both inhibitions of MAPK pathway and RhoB expression trigger cell death and should prompt a search for agents. Indeed co-targeting MAPK and RhoB pathways, could lead to a synthetic lethality and prevent resistance to either BRAF or MEK inhibitors.

Here we explored the expression of CSC markers CD90 and EpCAM in primary HCCs and cell lines to investigate the molecular characteristics of each cell type. Gene expression profiling and immunohistochemistry analyses were used to characterize 340 surgically resected HCC tissues and 11 advanced HCC tissues with distant organ metastasis obtained from autopsy. Magnetic-activated cell sorting was used to isolate EpCAM+ or CD90+ cells from surgically resected 12 fresh HCC specimens, which were tested for hepatic stem cell properties including their tumor initiating capacity in NOD/SCID mice. In primary HCC, EpCAM+ and CD90+ cells resided distinctively, and gene expression analysis of sorted cells suggested that EpCAM+ cells had the features of epithelial stem cells whereas CD90+ cells had those of vascular endothelial cells. Clinicopathological analysis indicated that presence of EpCAM+ cells was associated with poorly differentiated morphology and high serum AFP with a tendency of portal vein invasion, while the presence of CD90+ cells was associated with high incidence of distant organ metastasis within two years after surgical resection and advanced TNM stages. Serial xenotransplantation of EpCAM+/CD90+ cells in NOD/SCID mice revealed the rapid growth of EpCAM+ cells in the subcutaneous lesion and highly metastatic capacity of CD90+ cells into the lung. Xenotransplantation experiments of cell lines further demonstrated that EpCAM+ cells had the features of hepatic CSCs with marked tumorigenic capacity whereas CD90+ cells had those of vascular endothelial cells with highly metastatic features. Markedly, CD90+ cells showed the abundant expression of c-Kit and VEGFR1 and chemosensitivity to imatinib methylate (c-Kit inhibitor) and axitinib (VEGFR1/2 inhibitor).

In most cases, the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube harbored more SOX2 positive cells than the more proximal end.This is an initial attempt at visualizing proposed ovarian cancer stem cells in the fallopian tubes of women predisposed to developing HGSOC. Further research is needed to validate the significance of these findings, including investigating additional markers, testing different antibodies and performing multiple labeling experiments. Based on the currently prevailing theory that HGSOC originates from STICs in the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube, we find SOX2 to be the most promising candidate for further investigations, since SOX2 was the only marker found to be differentially expressed throughout the fallopian tube. Elucidating the cell of origin and etiology of HGSOC has important implications for early detection and preventive therapeutic approaches.']",

        "Background":"['Malignant melanoma (MM) is one of the most aggressive cancers that affect humans. It is the most common and fatal skin cancer, with an incidence that is critically increasing in Western populations (15 times in the last 40 years) and for which, in the advanced stages, there is no effective therapy. The search for new compounds able to control it is therefore essential. The hydroxylated biphenyl compound (3E,3E)-4,4-(5,5,6,6-tetramethoxy-[1,1-biphenyl]-3,3-diyl)bis(but-3-en-2-one), namely D6, a structural analogue of curcumin, showed a strong antitumor activity on MM cells both in vitro and in vivo, as we have recently described [1]. The mechanisms of action of this compound are not clear yet, but it inhibits cancer cells growth by inducing apoptosis without affecting normal fibroblasts growth. Firstly we investigated the ability of D6 to enter cells by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. The LC-MS data showed a quick cellular uptake of D6 with a maximum peak after about 2 hours. To investigate on the effects of D6 treatment on the cell cycle progression in MM cells, we performed flow cytometry analysis, which evidenced a cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Gene expression profiles analysis using Illumina high-density microarrays, was carried out on D6 treated MM cells and normal fibroblasts allowing the identification of 599 transcripts whose expression was modulated by D6 treatment in MM cells but not in normal fibroblast. The analysis of results, performed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software, showed the centrality of CDKN1A gene, encoding p21, a major negative cell cycle regulator, which was strongly over expressed, while cyclin B and cdc25 phosphatase, showed both to be down modulated. Other genes which expression interestingly appeared to be decreased by D6 activity were the oncogenes c-kit and PI3K, suggesting a down regulation of both c-kit mediated and PI3K/AKT signal transduction pathways driving to cell proliferation. Modulation of expression of these specific genes has been confirmed at a protein level by western blotting analysis. Moreover our results pointed out an upregulation of several heat shock family genes, which is probably due to a curcumin related anti inflammatory effect of D6. The preliminary results of these analysis show that D6 induces molecular changes in MM cells at both gene expression and protein levels, involving major cell proliferation regulatory pathways.

However, in early-stage breast cancer, molecular characterization of CTCs and their prognostic value is not well established. We previously found a significant correlation between DNA promotor methylation (PM) of PITX2, BMP4, FGF4, ERalpha, ERbeta and breast cancer recurrence and metastasis (unpublished data). Therefore, we sought to compare the frequency of PM of these genes in the CTC and the primary breast tumors (PBT) in relation to recurrence, progression free and overall survival rates (DFS& OS) CTCs were collected from the 10 cm peripheral blood of 80 primary invasive duct carcinoma (PIDC) patients by immunomagnetic beads separation. The number of CTCs was determined by flow cytometry (FCM) and RT-PCR (using CK-19, mammaglobin and CD44) for confirmation and comparison. Patients were first tested for CTC counts immediately before surgery, prior to therapy, at first follow-up (4-6 weeks later) and after 6 months. PM of PITX2, BMP4, FGF4, ERalpha, ERbeta was assessed by methylation specific PCR (MSP) in PBTs and CTCs and correlated with metastasis and survival. The number of CTCs ranged from 0-500/10 ml blood. The concordance between FCM and RT-PCR was 98% (p=0.01). At first assessment, 56 patients have 10 CTCs/10 ml blood and exhibited a significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (12.7 months versus 20.6 months) and overall survival (OS) (28.1 months versus 49.5 months) than women with 10 CTCs was 16.1 months, compared to greater than 36 months in the cohort with <10 CTCs. PM of PITX2, BMP4, FGF4, ERalpha and ERbeta, was reported in 42.90%, 50.00%, 51.20%, 63.10% and 46.40% compared to 63.15%, 73.75%, 62.5%, 81.2% and 78.75% in CTCs. PM of BMP4, and ERbeta was associated with reduced OS and PFS. Conclusions', ' 1) The presence of CTCs in the blood of PIDC patients can impact standard treatment and future research, 2) FCM provides a simple and accurate technique for enumerating CTCs in peripheral blood, 3) the significant increase in PM frequency of all studied genes except FGF4, suggests that aberrant PM may contribute to increased aggression and more liability to metastasis. More studies are still needed to assess the impact of CTCs in PIDC patients and how they might contribute to improving individualized cancer therapies.']",

        "Background":"['Ovarian cancer is the most lethal malignancy of the female reproductive system with an overall mortality rate of greater than 70%. Our group has demonstrated that Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the proliferation and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, inhibits apoptosis, and facilitates neovascularization by increasing expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). OCT4, a stem cell marker, is overexpressed in several types of human cancer and can induce resistance to chemotherapy and inhibition of apoptosis. We have found that FSH stimulates the expression of OCT4 mRNA and protein in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Subcellular analysis by immunofluorescent staining confirmed that FSH stimulation increased OCT4 protein expression in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of ovarian cancer cells. Re-expression of OCT4 in ovarian cancer cells reversed the inhibition of apoptosis induced by FSH, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown of OCT4 resulted in a significantly rate of apoptosis. Depletion of OCT4 resulted in reduction of p-AKT and survivin, and also blocked FSH-induced upregulation of p-AKT and survivin. Moreover, FSH stimulation induced the expansion of CD44+CD117+ cells with a stem cell-like phenotype. Interestingly, re-expression of OCT4 enhanced the expression of Notch, Sox2, and Nanog, molecules that play critical roles in cancer stem cell proliferation and differentiation. FSH upregulated the expression of Notch, Sox2 and Nanog and these effects were abolished by knocking down OCT4, suggesting that several cancer stem cell pathways are involved in FSH regulation. We have also examined OCT4 expression in surgical specimens of ovarian cancer. Immunohistostaining revealed that OCT4 expression was increased in ovarian carcinoma compared with benign cystadenomas and borderline tumors, and OCT4 expression was significantly correlated with histological grade. Staining for OCT4 was increased in serous cystadenocarcinoma, when compared with clear cell carcinoma. In summary, the OCT4 cancer stem cell signaling pathway may mediate FSH-induced inhibition of apoptosis and could provide a target for treatment of ovarian cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Cachexia is present in the majority of patients with advanced cancer progression and is not reversible through nutritional supplementation, leading to loss of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. There are a lack of quality pre-clinical models for cachexia research. Previously, Champions Oncology reported a mouse cachexia model derived from a primary human renal cell carcinoma tumor implanted in immunocompromised mice. This model, CTG-0804, was developed using the innovative Champions TumorGraft platform, which preserves the biological properties of the original human tumor. The Champions TumorGraft platform demonstrated dramatic weight loss in these mice as the tumor grew. Plasma from these mice also showed elevated levels of human IL-6. We have now further characterized this TumorGraft model by evaluating standard of care (SOC) agents for renal cell carcinoma and anti-IL-6 compounds to determine the mechanism of cachexia. The SOC evaluation revealed that sorafenib, sunitinib, temsirolimus and bevacizumab as single agents provided a survival advantage by inhibiting tumor growth and preventing weight loss in these mice. Blockade of human IL-6 with tocilizumab or ALD518 did not inhibit tumor growth and weight loss still occurred, demonstrating the possibility of other pathways involved in the cachexia mechanism. In addition, the SOC data for sunitinib showed significant tumor growth inhibition, but no regression at the study end point. This correlated with the clinical profile, where sunitinib could not prevent metastasis and the patient eventually progressed. The TumorGraft model was molecularly characterized and mutation analysis revealed a KIT V530I mutation. This mutation has been reported in extra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) and acute myeloid leukemia patients that have responded to c-kit targeting therapies, such as imatanib and dasatinib. Further characterization of this TumorGraft is ongoing to include additional bioinformatics using gene expression and mutation pathway analyses. In summary, we have continued development of this cachexia model using the Champions TumorGraft platform, along with molecular evaluation, to produce a robust and well-characterized approach for cachexia investigation which can also be applied to other areas of drug development and cancer research.']",

This study aimed to investigate the role of NRP-1 expression on monocytes in trastuzumab-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) targeting the HER2-positive human breast cell line SKBR3.MethodsPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy volunteers were prepared using Lymphoprep. The cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD14 and allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-NRP-1 antibodies, and an NRP-1high and NRP-1low monocyte subset was sorted using FACSAria. These cells were used as effector cells in a conventional ADCC assay using SKBR3 as target cells and trastuzumab as an antibody. Target cell cytotoxicity was measured using the LDH cytotoxic test kit. A CD107a degranulation assay was also used to determine the role of NRP-1 expression on monocytes in ADCC. PBMCs were co-cultured with target SKBR3 cells and trastuzumab for 2 h, stained with APC-conjugated anti-NRP-1 and PE-Cy5-conjugated anti-CD107a antibodies, and analyzed by flow cytometry.ResultsThe LDH cytotoxic test revealed significantly higher target cancer cell cytotoxicity in sorted NRP-1 high monocytes (12%) than in NRP-1 low monocytes (4%). Interestingly, microscopic findings showed that most NRP-1 high monocytes covered trastuzumab-treated target cancer cells (showing higher cellular cytotoxicity) while NRP-1 low monocytes did not cover the target cells but changed their morphology from a round to a dendritic shape (showing less cellular cytotoxicity) during ADCC. Moreover, the degranulation assay showed a higher expression of CD107a in NRP-1 high monocytes (17.4%) than in NRP-1 low monocytes (1.16%). Mean fluorescence intensity of CD107a in NRP-1 high and NRP-1 low monocytes was 92.6 and 26.3, respectively.ConclusionsThese data suggest that NRP-1 high monocytes exhibit higher trastuzumab-mediated ADCC than NRP-1 low monocytes in HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines.

XBP1s is a key positive regulator for unfolded protein response and a master transcription factor for plasma cell development.

We reasoned that sorafenib and protracted, daily temozolomide may provide complementary therapeutic benefit, and therefore performed a phase II trial of this regimen among patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Methods', ' Adult patients with GBM at any recurrence after standard temozolomide chemoradiotherapy received sorafenib administered at 400 mg twice daily and continuous daily temozolomide dosed at 50 mg/m2.

Patients and methods', ' From February 2008 to December 2008, 32 patients (pts) were treated with sorafenib (800 mg given daily). Clinical and blood exams were performed at baseline and every 2 weeks. Toxicity events were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria 3.0. The sorafenib area under the plasma concentration-time curve over 12 hours (AUC0-12) was determined every 2 weeks by gradient elution liquid chromatography, data analysis with one-compartment disposition and a population approach using NONMEM software. Grade 3 toxicity free survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Results', ' Pts (23 males), ECOG 0-1 (27 pts), median age 62.8 years (range 37-78), with metastatic hepato-carcinoma (11), melanoma (6), thyroid cancer (8), renal cell carcinoma (7), received a median treatment duration of 94 days (range ', ' 7-330). 20 pts experienced grade 3 toxicities with 33 events', ' hand-foot hyperkeratosis (14), diarrhea (5), cutanous rash (4), asthenia (2), anorexia (2), dyspnea (1), scrotal toxicity (1), post surgical complication (1), hypertension (1), increase creatinine level (1), digestive hemorrhage (1). The median AUC0-12 was 62.4 mg/L.h, ranging from 28.7 to 202.2 mg/L.h. Amongst pts experiencing grade 3 toxicity, two groups of 16 pts were defined with the median AUC0- 12 as cut off', ' low exposure (Lw) and high exposure (Hi). Six Lw pts experienced grade 3 toxicity versus 14 Hi pts (exact Fisher Test p=0.009). The probability of free grade 3 toxicity survival was higher for Lw (Logrank test p=0.004). Conclusions', ' These results show that grade 3 toxicity occurrence may be related to high plasma sorafenib exposure. This supports the need for therapeutic drug monitoring to prevent toxicity grade 3 occurrence and therefore optimize the clinical management of patients under sorafenib.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction', ' Upon interaction of CD70, a type II transmembrane protein, with its receptor CD27, the NFB pathway is activated, leading to proliferation and survival. Hence, CD70 expression is tightly regulated and only transient on cells of the lymphoid lineage. In contrast, constitutive overexpression of CD70 has been documented in malignancies, where it appears to mediate immune escape through recruitment of CD27+ regulatory cells. Soluble CD27 (sCD27), the extracellular domain of CD27, can be released after lymphocyte activation and has been detected at increased levels in serum samples of lymphoid malignancies. To our knowledge, expression of CD70 has never been systematically characterized in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods', ' Fourty-nine primary NSCLC formalin-fixed paraffin embedded and 9 metastatic biopsies were stained by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for expression of CD70 (Clone 301731, 1/40) and CD27 (Clone 137B4, 1/40), using the Dako autostainer Link and Ventana ultra, respectively. Additionally, sCD27 levels were analyzed in 19 serum samples, taken before of biopsy, with the PeliKine Compact human sCD27 ELISA kit. Finally, we tested the efficacy of ARGX-110, a CD70-blocking monoclonal IgG1 SIMPLE Antibody endowed with enhanced ADCC properties (POTELLIGENT), using the xCELLigence RTCA technology in CD70+ and CD70- cell lines.Results', ' In tumor cells, CD70 positivity (>10%) was detected in 16% of cases with a higher percentage in squamous NSCLC (27%) than in adenocarcinoma (9%). Additionally, one neuro-endocrine NSCLC was CD70+. We demonstrated identical CD70 patterns in primary and metastatic tissue in 8/10 biopsies. Furthermore, CD70 was found in the micro-environment of the tumor (23/49). IHC revealed high levels of CD27 expressing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in all NSCLC biopsies, with increasing FOXP3 expression and higher CD4/CD8 ratios in stromal tissue adjacent to CD70+ tumor cells. High sCD27 levels (>500U/ml) were found to be significantly associated with poor overall survival and even though sCD27 levels did not show potential as a blood-based biomarker for CD70 overexpression on tumor cells, dual positivity of CD70 and sCD27 marked even worse prognosis. We also showed that a low concentration of ARGX-110 (0.5g/ml) induces efficient NK cell based tumor lysis in CD70+ cell lines.Conclusion', ' Expression of CD70 was demonstrated in tumor cells and TILs of NSCLC. Moreover, all biopsies revealed infiltration of CD27+ TIL in the micro-environment of the tumor and a trend towards increased FOXP3 expression and higher CD4/CD8 ratios in CD70+ biopsies. In addition, serum sCD27 levels have potential as a prognostic marker for NSCLC. Lastly, our in vitro results showed a maximum ADCC of ARGX-110 in CD70+ target cells stained by IHC. Hence, our data suggest that CD70 might be an interesting therapeutic target in NSCLC.']",

        "Background":"['Prostate cancer (CaP) is the most common invasive malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in U.S. men. Androgen-independent/hormone-refractory CaP remains the primary cause of CaP death. The search for effective therapeutic and preventive strategies, particularly the ways to intervene in the progression of androgen-independent tumors remains the top priority of CaP research. Prostate cancer stem cells (CSCs) are suggested to be responsible for initiation, progression, drug resistance, recurrence and metastasis of CaP. Strategies that target prostate CSCs may significantly prevent and/or delay cancer progression and metastasis. The objective of this study was to identify the potent natural bioactive compounds for targeting prostate CSCs. The sphere-forming efficiencies in LNCaP, DUCaP, PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines were 2.8%, 15.7%, 1%, and 5.6%, respectively. The expression of several CSC related biomarkers, such as c-met, c-kit, bmi1 and CD44 were increased, whereas the expression of androgen receptor was decreased in prostate spheres. Natural compounds, especially tanshinones (tanshinone I (T1), tanshinone IIA (T2A), cryptotanshinone) and tea compounds (epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and theaflavines), inhibited the sphere-forming efficiency of CaP cells with T1 and T2A the most potent. Furthermore, T1 and EGCG significantly downregulated Bmi1 gene expression and protein level. Since Bmi1 has been reported to be a crucial regulator of stem cell self-renewal and malignant transformation, we further studied the functional role of bmi1 in self-renewal of prostate CSCs. Silencing of bmi1 dramatically inhibited the growth and decreased the sphere-forming ability of CaP cells. Animal studies showed that T1 and EGCG inhibited the growth and metastasis of prostate tumors associated with downregulation of bmi1 expression. The results derived from our preliminary studies suggest that bmi1 may play an important role in self-renewal ability of prostate CSCs, and that some natural bioactive agents, such as T1 and EGCG, may inhibit self-renewal of prostate CSCs in part via downregulation of bmi1 gene expression and function.

        "Background":"['Rare cancers are defined as those with an incidence of less than 0.05% in a given population, yet collectively make up 20% of all cancers. A proportion of these are characterized by a primary, driving genetic lesion which disrupts normal cell regulation, resulting in malignancy. Patients of rare cancer could potentially benefit from clinically approved targeted therapies developed for other cancers; however their rarity makes recruitment for clinical trials extremely difficult. Cell lines derived from these patients often maintain the genetic lesions present in the parent tumor, and therefore can serve as a platform to evaluate the efficacy of novel therapeutic strategies. Here we describe in vitro strategies for identifying novel treatment regimens for the rare, simple karyotype cancer Myxoid Liposarcoma (MLS). MLS is characterized by a single genetic event, the chromosomal translocation t(12;16)(q13;p11), which occurs in >95% of cases. The gene product of this translocation is the constitutively active fusion protein FUS-CHOP, which alters the expression of transcription factors responsible for regulating adipocytic differentiation. This drives the cells into a perpetual state of proliferation in the absence of differentiation, thus leading to malignancy. This study uses the cell lines MLS 402 and MLS 1765, which are derived from MLS patients, and express FUS-CHOP. Cells were screened with a panel of anti-cancer treatments, including antibodies, small molecule inhibitors and chemotherapies. Axitinib was identified as an efficacious treatment both alone and in combination with other therapies. Axitinib caused cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis as verified by Annexin V flow cytometry assay. This multi-kinase inhibitor targets the membrane-bound receptors c-Kit, PDGFR/ and VEGFR1/2/3. Western blot and bioplex assays were utilised to determine the downstream target molecules inhibited by axitinib treatment. Axitinib significantly reduced signalling activity through the AKT/mTOR and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways. Axitinib also displayed additive and synergistic anti-tumor activity with other targeted therapies. The establishment of cell lines that retain the key genetic mutation found in rare cancers is a useful approach for identifying novel therapeutic options.']",

        "Background":"['3,3’-diindolylmethane (DIM) and its halogenated derivatives (ring-DIMs) are recently shown to induce protective autophagy in human prostate cancer cells. The mechanism of induction of autophagy by DIM has not been elucidated. As DIM is a mitochondrial ATP synthase inhibitor, we hypothesized that DIM and ring-DIMs induce autophagy via alteration of AMP/ATP ratio and activation of AMPK signaling in prostate cancer cells. Autophagic activity was monitored by LC3B-I to LC3B-II conversion in LNCaP and C42B prostate cancer cells. Autophagic vacuoles were examined using Cyto-ID autophagy detection kit and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Protein levels for AMPK, pAMPK, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), pACC, AEG-1, pULK-1 and β-actin were measured by western blot. AMPK and AEG-1 gene expression was downregulated using siRNA. DIM and ring-DIMs induced autophagy by increasing autophagic vacuoles and LC3B-I to LC3B-II conversion in LNCaP and C42B cells. These compounds also induced AMPK, ULK-1 and ACC phosphorylation in a time dependent manner. Interestingly, DIM, 4,4’ dibromoDIM and 7,7’ dichloroDIM induced the oncogenic protein AEG-1 time dependently in LNCaP and C42B cells. Downregulation of AEG-1 or AMPK inhibited DIM- and ring-DIM-induced autophagy. Pretreatment with ULK1 inhibitor MRT 67307 or siRNAs targeting AEG-1 or AMPK potentiated the cytotoxicity of DIM and ring-DIMs. Interestingly, downregulation of AEG-1 induced senescence in cells treated with toxic concentrations of DIM or ring-DIMs, and inhibited the onset of apoptosis in response to DIM or ring-DIMs. In summary, we identified a novel mechanism for DIM- and ring-DIM-induced protective autophagy, via induction of AEG-1 and activation of AMPK. Our findings could help towards the development of novel drug therapies for prostate cancer that include selective autophagy inhibitors as adjuvants.']",

        "Background":"[\"MYC overexpression occurs in up to 80% of all cancers. Down-regulating MYC's expression is an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of many of these cancers, and particularly for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). NHL is the fifth most common cancer type, accounting for 5% of all cancers and 4% of all cancer deaths. Developing MYC-targeting therapeutics will be very impactful to NHL patients. In the current study, we have developed a nucleic acid clamp to transcriptionally down-regulate MYC expression by stabilizing the G-quadruplex (G4) formed in the nuclease hypersensitivity element III1 promoter region. The clamps complement nucleotides on the 5- and 3- regions flanking the G4-forming sequence, linked together with an 18 angstrom abasic moiety. To date, the binding affinity and specificity, G4 structure stabilizing ability, MYC down-regulation capability, and the selective cytotoxicity on cancerous vs non-cancerous cell lines of these clamps have been confirmed by EMSA and electronic circular dichroism, DMS footprinting, luciferase reporter assay, and MTS viability assay respectively. Recently, various replacements have been explored to replace the abasic moiety with non-complementary nucleic acids and to optimize the phosphate backbone with peptide nucleic acids. In addition, complexation with block co-polymers is under investigation to develop a functionalizable nanotherapeutic for NHL. The highly selective G4 stabilizing ability of the clamps used in the current approach offers an advantage over traditional G4 stabilizing small molecules. This novel approach is a promising therapeutic for the treatment of MYC related malignancies, and provides a framework for future G4-therapeutic development for other high-value genes, such as kRAS, VEGF, c-KIT and many more.\"]",

ENMD-2076 has shown promising activity in multiple Phase 1 clinical trials, as well as in a Phase 2 trial in advanced ovarian cancer. ENMD-2076 is currently the subject of several ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials including fibrolamellar carcinoma, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), advanced/metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS), and advanced ovarian clear cell carcinomas (OCCC). ENMD-2076 has been developed to date as a single agent, however ENMD-2076 inhibits a spectrum of targets including Aurora A, FAK, CSF1R, c-Kit, and KDR, that are potentially involved in immune evasion mechanisms.

It is known that patients with intestinal GIST have markedly higher risks for recurrence compared to those with gastric GISTs.

In this study, we sought to address mechanisms underlying the clinically malignant phenotype of intestinal GISTs.Methods\", ' Fresh frozen samples of 6 primary gastric GISTs, 3 primary intestinal GISTs and 6 metastatic liver GISTs were utilized for cDNA microarray analysis. None of the patients had received imatinib therapy before surgery. Gene expression levels were compared between primary gastric and intestinal GISTs using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Protein levels of SLIT2 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 25 primary gastric GISTs and 10 intestinal GISTs.Results', ' Microarray analysis of primary gastric and intestinal GISTs and metastatic liver GISTs classified them into two groups according their gene expressions. One group consisted of primary gastric GISTs without postoperative recurrence and the other consisted of clinically malignant GISTs, intestinal GISTs and metastatic liver GISTs, suggesting that intestinal GISTs potentially show gene expression profile similar to clinically malignant and metastatic GISTs. GSEA revealed that the gene set MITOTIC_CELL_CYCLE was upregulated in intestinal GISTs compared with gastric GISTs, consistent with previous reports that intestinal GISTs show higher mitotic count. The gene set NEURON_DIFFERENTIATION was downgulated in intestinal GISTs compared with gastric GISTs that may help explain mitosis-independent mechanisms underlying the clinically malignant phenotype of intestinal GISTs. In this gene set, we focused on SLIT2, downregulation of which has been reported to be associated with aggressive phenotypes in human cancers. Immunohistochemistry revealed that intestinal GISTs expressed lower SLIT2 protein than gastric GISTs, and that high-risk gastric GISTs and intestinal GISTs express comparable levels of SLIT2 protein which were lower than low-risk gastric GISTs. In SLIT2-high GISTs, tumor size was significantly smaller than in SLIT2-low GISTs, whereas mitotic counts and MIB-1 index were comparable among three groups according to SLIT2 intensity.Conclusions', ' Gene expression profile of intestinal GISTs was similar to that in metastatic liver GISTs.

Murine metastatic melanoma B16-F10 cells were transduced with a neo resistant gene, and were subcutaneously (s.c.) implanted in many C57BL/6 mice to obtain spontaneous tumor metastasis. Three weeks later, various tissues including bone marrow were harvested from the mice, and the single-cell suspensions were cultured in G418-supplemented medium for tumor selection. To characterize the post-EMT tumor cells, RT-PCR, immunostaining and cellular functional assay were conducted. As compared to the primary tumor cells harvested from s.c. tumor tissues, these tumor cells proliferated extremely slowly, and were resistant to chemotherapeutics, but rapidly grew in vivo after implantation. However, these tumor cells were very adhesive accompanied by increase of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin, but not mesenchymal markers such as Snail, indicating epithelial features. In addition, its chemoresistance and in vivo tumorgenesis activity of these tumor cells were superior to those of even Snail-transduced B16-F10 tumor cells, which were harvested from the metastatic lesions in a similar way. DNA microarray analysis revealed the significant upregulation of epithelial markers and drug resistant genes such as c-kit and GDF15 in the post-EMT tumor cells, as compared to those of the Snail transfectant.

Methods', ' We performed immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray of tumor and adjacent liver tissue from 40 HBV-infected HCC patients who were treated with sorafenib, and 20 normal liver. We compared the levels of 8 signaling proteins including growth factor receptors (PDGFRa, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, c-kit, c-met, IGF-R, EGFR), tumor suppressors (PTEN) and their downstream phosphorylated (p-) signal transducers (p-RAF, p-MEK1/2, p-ERK1/2; PI3K, p-AKT, NFkB, axin, -catenin,p-GSK3, p-mTOR, p-S6, p-70S6K, p-JNK, p-SRC, p-STAT3, c-fos, c-jun) in cancer cells and endothelial cells of HCC to those in non-neoplastic liver. Results', ' The overall profiles of signalling protein expression levels, activation states and subcellular distribution in HCC cells and endothelial cells were distinguishable from non-neoplastic hepatocytes. The ERK pathway activation was correlated with low level of nuclear -cat and high level of p-mTOR (p<0.05). Long survival (>6m) patients were characterized by high level of nuclear pERK and low level of p-AKT, p-GSK3 (p<0.05) in tumor cells. The high microvessel density and the presence of micrometastases correlated with high level of VEGFR, p-ERK and p-SRC in endothelial cells.

In the present study, we implanted tumor cells with the same genetic background into C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and AIP1-deficient (AIP1-KO) mice to address this question. In subcutaneous (SQ) allograft models using B16 melanoma and LLC Lewis lung carcinoma, tumor growth and metastasis to multiple organs including lymph node, lung, liver, spleen and bone marrow were significantly enhanced in AIP1-KO host, suggesting AIP1 in tumor microenvironment limits tumor metastases. However, a direct intravenously injection of tumor cells resulted in no differences in tumor metastasis between WT and AIP1-KO mice, indicating AIP1 in host regulates tumor metastasis at steps prior to extravasation to target tissues. We examined effects of AIP1 deletion on the induction of local inflammation, tumor cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), generation of metastatic routes (formation of new blood and lymphatic vessels) and establishment of pre-metastatic niche in distance tissues. SQ tumors in AIP1-KO host showed more profound increases in macrophage infiltration, tumor cell EMT, intratumoral angiogenesis and peri-tumoral lymphangiogenesis as well as lymphangiogenesis in lymph nodes prior to the detection of metastatic tumor cells. Finally, SQ tumor induced an establishment of pre-metastatic niche in lung as indicated by increased immunostaining for fibronectin and accumulation of VEGFR1, c-Kit and CXCR-positive cells which were augmented in AIP1-KO mice. Importantly, WT recipient with AIP1-KO bone marrow-derived cells showed similar phenotype to AIP1-KO mice in tumor growth and metastasis.

This study aimed to investigate the role of Nrp1 on monocytes in trastuzumab-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) targeting the HER2-positive human breast cancer cell line SKBR3. In addition, we evaluated the gene expression profile of monocytes expressing high and low levels of Nrp1.MethodsPeripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers were prepared using BD Vacutainer CPT Cell Preparation Tubes. The cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD14 and allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-Nrp1 antibodies, and Nrp1high and Nrp1low monocyte subsets were sorted using FACSAria. These cells were used as effector cells in a conventional ADCC assay with SKBR3 as target cells and trastuzumab as the antibody. Target cell cytotoxicity was measured using the LDH cytotoxic test kit. The effector cell to target cell ratios of 20', '1 and 10', '1 were used. Gene expression analysis was performed by Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays. All study protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan (authorization number G424).ResultsThe LDH cytotoxic test revealed significantly higher target cancer cell cytotoxicity in sorted Nrp1high monocytes than in Nrp1low monocytes (75% vs. 45%, p<0.01). Trastuzumab-mediated ADCC was significantly suppressed by Nrp1 neutralization antibodies in a dose-dependent manner (Control arm 14.3%, Treatment arm 6%; p<0.01). Gene expression analysis revealed that 308 genes were up-regulated in the Nrp1high population, including monocyte-specific chemokine receptor and hematopoietic transcriptional factor.ConclusionThese results suggest that determination of Nrp1 expression can be used to classify monocytes as populations with and without cellular cytotoxic activity.

Our previous publications demonstrated that S100P was a highly sensitive biomarker in identifying pancreatic mucinous neoplasms (PMNs) and invasive ductal adenocarcinomas (ADCs) on both cytological and surgical specimens. When working on pancreatic cystic lesions, there are two important undertakings', \" 1) distinguishing mucinous neoplasms from non-mucinous cysts and 2) predicting the presence of invasive adenocarcinomas. In this study, we investigated the potential utility of S100P for these purposes.Design. Thirty pancreatic cystic fluid samples obtained by EUS-FNA biopsy were retrieved from Geisinger Biospecimen Bank. Diagnosis was based on definitive cytological diagnosis in all cases and additional surgical pathology confirmation in 11 cases. These 30 samples included 7 benign cysts in Group 1, 14 PMNs in Group 2, and 9 ADCs in Group 3. The S100P protein level of each sample was quantitatively measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) (CircuLex S100P ELISA kit, MBL International Corporation) according to the vendor's protocol.Results. The results are summarized in Table 1. Marked elevation of S100P was seen in 6 of 9 ADCs (2129.81 + 1834.34 ng/ml), in contrast to the moderate increase in Group 2 (666.67 + 1439.91 ng/ml) and the minimal increase in Group 1 (22.27 + 18.62 ng/ml). Using 50 ng/ml as a cutoff value to differentiate a PMN/ADC (Group 2 and Group 3) from a benign cyst (Group 1), the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for identifying a PMN/ADC were 60.9%, 100%, 100%, and 43.8%, respectively.Conclusion. These preliminary data suggest that S100P is a useful biomarker in identifying invasive adenocarcinomas and in distinguishing mucinous neoplasms from non-mucinous cysts. Caution should be taken since some ADCs may show only mildly increased S100P levels, similar to some PMNs and non-mucinous cysts.

The present study was undertaken in order to explore the role of SRMS in signaling downstream of KIT. The receptor tyrosine kinase KIT, also known as the stem cell factor receptor, plays a key role in several developmental processes and have been implicated in many human cancers such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, acute myeloid leukemia and testicular carcinoma. To understand the role of SRMS in KIT signaling, we generated Ba/F3 cell lines overexpressing KIT and SRMS. We observed that SRMS regulates normal and oncogenic KIT signaling differentially with respect to cell proliferation and apoptosis. SRMS association triggers KIT ubiquitination which in turn downregulates the receptor. Further, expression of SRMS downregulates wild-type KIT-mediated phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2, p38. Taken together the data demonstrates that SRMS regulates both normal KIT and an oncogenic mutant of KIT, and have differential impact on receptor downstream signaling.']",

Chronic exposure to arsenic is associated with cancers in various tissues, including skin, urinary bladder, lung, liver, kidney and prostate. However, the mechanism underlying arsenic-induced carcinogenesis remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that long-term (six month) exposure to low levels of sodium arsenite (0.25  M) in human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) results in altered morphology, increased cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation in soft agar, indicative of malignant transformation of these cells. Moreover, tumorigenesis analysis revealed that s.c. inoculation of the arsenic-transformed cells can induce tumors in nude mice. The tumors can be observed after 2-3 weeks even only 500 arsenic-transformed cells were injected, suggesting that these transformed cells induced by long-term and low-dose arsenic treatment are highly tumorigenic.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Despite the tremendous promise of new signal transduction and angiogenesis inhibitors, these targeted drugs have met with mixed results so far in the clinic. In solid tumors, inhibition of multiple targets may be necessary for significant clinical effects. Dasatinib is an inhibitor of all SRC-family kinases, as well as BCR-ABL, c-KIT, multiple EPH-family kinases, PDGF receptor and other tyrosine kinases. Bevacizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds all biologically active isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with high affinity. Attenuation of both c-Src and VEGF pathways simultaneously provides the potential for synergistic antitumor activity, as there is a extensive interaction between these pathways. VEGFR transmits its downstream signal through multiple pathways involving c-Src (including activation of the prosurvival FAK pathway). Alternatively, VEGF production is known to be Src-mediated (including via STAT5 signaling). Thus, inhibition of c-Src may block the VEGF angiogenic stimulus in at least two independent ways. As they have a largely non- overlapping toxicity profile, we have initiated a Phase I trial combining these two drugs. Methods', ' Objectives', ' Determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of dasatinib and bevacizumab. Determine biochemical changes in the src-FAK and src-PLC-g and VEGF signal transduction pathways in tumor and stromal cells in response to treatment at the MTD. Eligibility', ' Adults with histologically documented solid tumor malignancy that is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative therapies do not exist or are no longer effective. Design', 'This is an open-label phase I dose escalation study. Dasatanib will be orally administered daily and bevacizumab will be given intravenously every two weeks.

        "Background":"['Brain metastases occur in approximately 35% of metastatic breast cancer patients whose tumors overexpress HER2. Brain colonization of cancer cells occurs in a unique environment, containing microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and neurons. While a neuroinflammatory response has been documented in brain metastasis, its contribution to cancer progression and therapy remains poorly understood. Using a model system to study experimental brain metastasis of breast cancer, we intensively characterized the brain metastatic microenvironment of a brain tropic, HER2-transfected MDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma subline (231-BR-HER2). The 231-BR-HER2 cell line was injected into the left cardiac ventricle of immunocompromised mice; mice were treated with vehicle, 30mg/kg or 100mg/kg pazopanib twice a day beginning on day 3 post-injection, for 4 weeks. Pazopanib, a multispecific tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR-1, -2, and -3, PDGFR- and , and c-kit, directly targeted tumor cells through the disruption of B-Raf pathway, prevents the outgrowth of 231-BR-HER2 large brain metastases by 73% (p<0.0001). Here we evaluated the effect of pazopanib on the brain micro-environment microenvironment. A novel subpopulation of metastasis-associated astrocytes expressing phosphorylated (Y751) PDGFR was identified surrounding brain metastases. This subpopulation of p751-PDGFR + astrocytes was also identified in human brain metastases from five different craniotomy specimens. Expression of p751-PDGFR was studied in primary cultures of astrocyte-enriched glial cells. p751-PDGFR expression was increased in response to soluble factors from cultured breast cancer cells, and was inhibited by pazopanib treatment. In the mouse mode, pazopanib treatment resulted in a 70% (p=0.023) decrease of the p751-PDGFR+ astrocyte population, at the lowest dose of 30mg/kg, twice daily. In contrast, pazopanib did not have any effect on microglia expression. Collectively, the data identify a new subpopulation of activated astrocytes in the perivascular stage of subclinical brain metastases and demonstrate that they are inhibitable by pazopanib, suggesting its potential to prevent the development of brain metastases from breast cancer patients.']",

We report here that SPECT(single photon emission computed tomography) imaging of VEGFR-2 in HT29 tumor xenografts allows for detailed assessment of its prevalence in the course of treatment with pazopanib, a TKI targeting VEGFR, PDGFR and c-Kit, recently approved for the treatment of advanced renal carcinoma. Methods', ' VEGFR-2 SPECT imaging was done using scVEGF/Tc, an engineered single chain (sc) form of VEGF radiolabeled with 99mTc. This tracer binds to and is internalized by VEGFR-2 in tumor vasculature, allowing for selective accumulation of 99mTc in tumor endothelial cells. All SPECT imaging experiments were carried out on HT29 tumor xenografts on Swiss nude mice. A dose of 2-4 mCi of [99mTc]scVEGF was injected into the retro-orbital venous sinus in a volume of 100 to 220 L followed by imaging two hours later. Quantitative histogram analysis of the SPECT images was performed. At the end of imaging experiments the mice were sacrificed and the tumors were harvested for immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-1, as well as panendothelial marker CD31. Results', ' The imaging results, which are consistent with IHC analysis, show that VEGFR-2 levels in tumors were significantly reduced upon treatment with pazopanib as early as day 5 after the initiation of therapy, when morphological changes were barely detectable. A detailed kinetic study to understand the dose dependence of the effects of pazopanib on tumor VEGFR is in progress and those results will also be presented.

The disease is highly heterogeneous with 2 year survival rates, after intensive chemotherapy regimens depending on cytogenetic and molecular risk factors, varying between 70% for patients with good risk and less than 10% in those with poor prognostic features.In recent years clinical success has been achieved in the treatment of several cancer types with kinase inhibitors (KIs) and they may prove to be a valuable addition to standard therapy in AML. However, a proper rationale to select a suitable KI is still lacking. Phosphoproteomics based on tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a powerful approach for unbiased, global profiling of protein phosphorylation, and could identify aberrancies in signal transduction pathways and associated key kinases that may be suitable for targeted treatment with KIs.The aim of this study is to identify candidate driver kinases and signaling routes that may be targets for kinase inhibitor treatment by analyzing 16 selected AML cell lines.Methods', ' Sixteen different AML cell lines were cultured (EOL-1, HEL, HL-60, Kasumi-1, Kasumi-3, Kasumi-6, KG-1, KG-1a, ME-1, ML2, MM6, MOLM-13, MV-4-11, NB-4, OCI-AML3, THP1). For each cell line 10 mg protein lysate was processed. Phospho-Tyrosine containing peptides were captured from AML cell line lysates using the pY1000 antibody in an immunoprecipitation (IP) experiment.

Interestingly, AML cell lines without known kinase-related genomic aberrations also showed high activation of several kinases which could be potential KI targets. Current data analysis will link phosphokinases to downstream phosphoprotein substrates and pathways, in order to prioritize (combinations of) candidate driver kinases for functional perturbation experiments.Conclusion', ' Phosphoproteomics analysis of a panel of 16 AML cell lines showed differential (hyper-) activation of multiple kinases, including those already implicated in AML.

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play a role in MPNST growth and include c-KIT, PDGFR, and CSF1R, all of which are inhibited by pexidartinib (PLX3397, PEX). We reported that the combination of PEX and the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus (S) synergistically inhibited MPNST growth (Patwardhan P. et al CCR 20', ' 3146, 2014). Inhibiting CSF1R resulted in a marked depletion of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in MPNST xenografts and a shift from M2 (tumor promoting) to M1 (tumor inhibiting) TAMs within tumors. This effect on TAMs was enhanced and sustained by mTOR inhibition with S.

We postulated that MicroTumors established from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors will allow for accurate analysis of drug response and preserve molecular signaling of parent tumors. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common primary brain malignancy, was used to test our hypothesis.

The Hedgehog pathway (PTCH1/SMO/SUFU) was altered in 2% of cases.  ALK and RET were rearranged in 4% and 2% of cases, respectively, with several cases initially diagnosed negative by FISH testing.   Conclusions', '  Profiling the tumor genomes of 364 LC patients led to the identification of a series of GA not detectable by hotspot testing that could significantly inform targeted treatment decisions.  Moreover, actionable GA appeared in unexpected tumor type, i.e. an EGFR mutation in a SCLC, reinforcing the likely utility of clinical cancer genomic profiling for the personalized treatment of LC patients.']",

Results presented herein are from two arms of a phase-Ib five arm trial of MP combined with standard of care (SOC) anti- cancer therapies. Methods', ' MP is administered in combination with SOC in a 21-day cycle. Adults with ECOG PS of 0-2 and malignant disease appropriate for SOC regimens consisting of paclitaxel/carboplatin (PC), carboplatin/etoposide (CE), topotecan, docetaxel, and erlotinib were enrolled. Each arm follows a 3+3 design where MP is escalated based on the modified Fibonacci sequence until the MTD of MP in combination with SOC agents is reached. RECIST and CTCAE are utilized to assess response and safety, respectively. The primary objectives of the study are to determine the MTD, DLTs, and quantify the effects of MP on the PK of SOC agents. Results', ' Between Dec 2007 and Aug 2008, 26 subjects were enrolled in the PC and CE arms and received a total of 70 cycles (median 2; range, 0-8) of MP at 4 dose levels (100-500 mg/day).

        "Background":"['The tumor suppressor 2A (PP2A) is a multi-enzyme complex that targets a variety of oncogenic signaling cascades such as Raf, MEK and AKT. Numerous reports have now emerged indicating that the inhibition of PP2A leads to the development of tumors including breast, gastric and lung and a range of hematological malignancies such as chronic and acute myeloid leukemia (CML and AML, respectively). We and others have shown that inhibition of PP2A is crucial for the oncogenic effects of leukemia associated receptor tyrosine kinases such as BCR/Abl, c-KIT and FLT3. Importantly when PP2A is reactivated using pharmacological agents (FTY720 and AAL(S)), growth and survival of these cells is inhibited. This approach targets molecules downstream of these oncogenic kinases and thus PP2A reactivation is designed to avoid resistance associated with kinase inhibitor therapy. As the mechanism of action of these PP2A activators is unknown, it is essential that we now determine the molecular targets of these compounds to generate more effective drugs. Using a chemical proteomics approach incorporating click chemistry linking the drugs to beads, unbiased pull down assays were performed in myeloid leukaemia cells and protein isolates were identified by mass spectrometry. Using this approach we have identified a novel cellular target, which is known to be overexpressed in a range of cancers, including leukemias. We have also shown that this protein associates with PP2A complexes in these cells, and thus may act as an endogenous inhibitor of PP2A activity. We have also performed phospho-proteomics and co-immunoprecipitation studies to identify protein changes in myeloid leukemia cells in response to PP2A activators. In addition to identifying known PP2A targets, such as Akt and ERK, we have also identified a number of novel protein changes, including altered expression of the SET oncoprotein. SET is a known inhibitor of PP2A, suggesting that FTY720 may act via inhibition of SET. Other PP2A regulatory proteins such as CIP2A, PME-1 and PP2A-B56alpha are also affected by FTY720/AAL(S) treatment. Our research findings are thus providing the vital clues necessary for determining the mechanism of action of clinically relevant PP2A activators, thereby moving us towards the provision of novel anti-cancer treatment regimes.']",

        "Background":"['Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been reported to migrate to tumor stroma as well as injured tissue. We reported that, in an orthotopic nude mice model of colon cancer, MSCs travel to tumor stroma and differentiate into carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and then, they promote growth and metastasis of colon cancer. We also found that CAFs express platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFR-), at a high level and that imatinib therapy targeting PDGFR in CAFs combined with administration of a cytotoxic drug significantly inhibits growth and metastasis of human colon cancer. A novel oral multi-kinase inhibitor, regorafenib not only inhibits oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases such as c-KIT, RET, and B-RAF, but also inhibits stromal cells which express VEGFR1-3, TIE2, PDGFR-, and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). These cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases are known to be involved in tumor neovascularization, vessel stabilization, lymphatic vessel formation as well as activation of stroma. We examined whether the effect of MSCs on tumor growth and metastasis was inhibited by regorafenib. KM12SM human colon cancer cells alone or KM12SM cells mixed with MSCs in a 1', '2 ratio were transplanted into the cecal wall of nude mice. Orthotopic transplantation of KM12SM cells + MSCs, in comparison to transplantation of KM12SM cells alone, resulted in tumors of greater weight and volume, and higher rate of lymphatic metastasis. Co-injection of MSCs with tumor cells promoted tumor growth and metastasis of colon cancer by enhancing angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and tumor cell proliferation and by inhibiting tumor cell apoptosis. When CRC tumor + MSCs bearing animals were treated with regorafenib (by oral gavage once daily at 10 mg/kg for 35 days), primary tumor size or the number of lymph node metastases were significantly decreased compared to those treated with vehicle, and reached to the level with no significant difference from KM12SM tumor cells alone.

        "Background":"['Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common uterine malignancy in industrialized countries and is the most frequent gynecologic cancer in the United States with an estimated 60,050 new cases in 2016. Traditionally observed in peri-, postmenopausal women, the incidence rate of EC has steadily increased among younger women of reproductive age over the past two decades partially owing to a more sedentary lifestyle and rampant obesity epidemic. Surgery in combination with either radio- and or chemotherapy is commonly curative for the early stage of the disease. However, patients with recurrent or metastatic disease, who only respond poorly to cytotoxic chemotherapy are in desperate need of therapeutic alternatives as are patients of reproductive age. Thus, innovative, safe and more effective therapies are mandated. Several studies have demonstrated the increased expression of various tyrosine kinase receptors involved in the development of EC. We hypothesized that a targeted therapeutic approach using a pan-tyrosine kinase inhibitor would prevent the proliferation and progression of EC. Anlotinib (AL3818) is a multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 to 3 (VEGFR1-3), stem cell factor receptor (C-kit), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFβ), and fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 to 3 (FGFR1-3). We tested a panel of seven human endometrial cancer cell lines (AN3Ca, Ishikawa, HEC1A, HEC1B, KLE, MFE280 and MFE296) to assess the cytotoxicity of anlotinib in vitro. A lower IC50 value was observed in AN3Ca cells (25 nM), a cell line characterized by a high level of expression of an FGFR2 mutant protein, while cell lines expressing FGFR2 wild-type are less sensitive to anlotinib (HEC1A', ' 33 μM, or HEC1B', '36 μM). Somatic mutations of FGFR2 have been observed in 12% of EC, indicating the potential for this drug in a subset of EC patients. In summary, these results suggest improved efficacy of anlotinib for the treatment of ECs expressing an increased level of FGFR2 mutant proteins. The safety and efficacy of anlotinib are currently being evaluated in an orthotopic AN3Ca mouse model of EC. Experimental groups include a tumor bearing control not subjected to any treatment, anlotinib alone, carboplatin/paclitaxel, a combination of anlotinib and carboplatin/paclitaxel. Primary study endpoints include tumor growth retardation, the delayed onset of local metastases as well as reduced toxicity as secondary endpoint.']",

This \"synthetic lethality\" (Nature 434', '913, ‘05) can be enhanced by agents that inhibit DNA repair (Mol Onc 8', '1429, ‘14; Proc AACR 57', '3718, ‘16). To exploit this potential \"Achilles heel\", we tested the ability of a small molecule inhibitor of RAD51 to potentiate the cytotoxicity of established chemotherapy drugs. 2-(benzylsulfonyl)-1-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline (IBR2) was obtained from Drs. J-W Zhu and W-H Lee (Univ. California - Irvine). IBR2 inhibits RAD51-mediated double-strand DNA break repair, but also enhances induction of apoptosis by the ABL inhibitor imatinib against K562 cells (EMBO Mol Med 5', '353, ‘13). There is potential value of such synergistic interaction among other tumor types and with other drugs. IBR2-drug combinations were therefore examined across a spectrum of cancer cell lines from various tissues (AML, CML, carcinoma of breast, colon, stomach, lung, and head) representing a range of oncogenic drivers (ABL, c-kit, Raf, Ras, ER, mutant p53). Cells were exposed to IBR2 simultaneously with inhibitors of various tyrosine kinase receptors, DNA-damaging agents, or inhibitors of microtubule function. Cells were cultured in 96-well plates, exposed to drugs alone and in combination, and cell density determined by viability staining (alamarBlue or neutral red) 4 days later. Inhibition of proliferation by drug combinations was normalized to that of IBR2 alone. Depending on the drug sensitivity of the cell line, IBR2, at concentrations that inhibited proliferation between 0% and 75% as a single agent, enhanced toxicity of imatinib by up to 80%. IBR2 also greatly enhanced antiproliferative activity of regorafenib (targets RAF, kit, others), EGFR inhibitors erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib and osimertinib, and microtubule inhibitor vincristine (VCR). However, IBR2 was antagonistic with VP-16, cisplatin, irinotecan, melphalan, and olaparib. To determine a possible mechanism of the observed synergy, the interaction between IBR2 and imatinib or VCR was compared with that between verapamil, a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, and the latter 2 drugs. The VCR-resistant head and neck cell line HN-5a/V15e was not cross-resistant to imatinib, but IBR2 enhanced imatinib toxicity in this cell line, its HN-5a parent, and HT-29 by up to 60%, much better than verapamil (up to 40% at similar concentrations, P<0.05). IBR2 enhanced VCR toxicity in these 3 lines to degree similar to verapamil, decreasing the IC50 by up to 90%. IBR2 appears to enhance drug toxicities via mechanisms other than just inhibition of RAD51 and may potentially interfere with microtubule function. The results indicate that this agent may be useful as a clinical adjuvant to numerous cytotoxic drugs.']",
