        "Background":"['Her-2/neu oncogene is overexpressed in human breast cancer and is correlated with the tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, and resistance against chemo- and hormonotherapy. The expression levels of both Her-2/neu gene and HER-2 protein are recommended for evaluation of treatment efficacy as well as for selection of treatments. However, clinical studies have shown that the Her-2/neu gene and the HER-2 protein are differently expreesed in 10-15% of human breast cancers and we hypothesized that the expression difference might be related to the post-transcriptional regulation of the Her-2/neu gene by microRNAs (miRNAs). To identify the specific miRNAs, we first analyzed 120 human breast cancer samples for the Her-2/neu gene amplification and protein expression with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Fourty-four cancer samples (36.7%, 44/120) showed overexpression of HER-2 protein with IHC (IHC+) and 26 samples (26.5%, 26/98) exhibited Her-2/neu gene amplification with FISH (FISH+). Interestingly, five samples exhibited amplification of the Her-2/neu gene, but absence of the HER-2 protein expression (FISH+/IHC-). We then dissected the FISH+/IHC- tumor cells using laser capture microdissection from the five samples. Tumor cells with FISH+/IHC+ from another set of five samples were also dissected and analyzed as the control. Based on TargetScanHuman and literature search, five candidate miRNAs including miR-125b, -1224-3p, -1296, -193a-5, and -331-3p were screened with quantitative real-time RT-PCR and their expression levels in the FISH+/IHC- cells were 3.1-, 2.7-, 1.7-, 1.7-, and 1.3-fold higher than in the FISH+/IHC+ cells, respectively, with a significant difference for miR-1224-3p and miR-1296 (both P < 0.01). These results indicate that miR-1224-3p and miR-1296 may be responsible for the different expressions of Her-2/neu gene and its protein by regulating the Her-2/neu gene posttranscription, thus down-regulating the HER-2 protein expression in FISH+/IHC- breast cancer cells.']",

Patients and Methods', ' s-HER- 2/neu was measured at time of primary diagnosis in the pretherapeutical (presurgical) sera of 525 breast cancer patients with known HER- 2/neu-status in breast cancer tissue. 33 of the patients (6,3%) revealed to have distant metastases (M1). The HER-2/neu- status in tumor tissue was determined by immunhistochemistry, followed by subsequent FISH analysis in case of score 2+. Dako-Score 3+ or 2+ and geneamplification in FISH analysis were regarded as HER-2/neu-positive. HER-2/neu shed antigen was analysed by Immunoassay. Results', ' For patients without distant metastases (M0) as well as patients with distant metastases (M1) we observed a correlation of s-HER-2/neu with HER-2/neu-status.

        "Background":"['Checkpoint inhibition is a very successful treatment strategy in cancers that are naturally immunogenic by attracting T cells into the tumor microenvironment (TME) and promoting cytotoxic signaling pathways. While this strategy has shown some efficacy in metastatic breast cancer, most breast cancers are not highly immunogenic likely due to an immunosuppressive microenvironment and a lack of tumor antigen expression and recognition. One strategy to transform the breast TME into one that is immune responsive, is to use epigenetic modulation to expose tumor antigens, promote cytokine production, thus, attracting inflammatory cells into the tumor. Epigenetic modulation also has the potential to affect activation and trafficking of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), known to alter the immunogenicity of the TME and thus, sensitizing tumors to checkpoint modulation. We hypothesize that combinatorial therapy primes the TME by increasing immunogenicity via alteration of T cells and MDSCs. We also hypothesize that combination therapy will significantly affect immune modulatory pathways. Alterations in these could serve as a functional read out of combinatorial therapy. We are using a Her-2/neu (neu-N) transgenic mouse model which through the use of various syngeneic cell lines has the capability to inform the response of Her2 and triple negative subtypes of breast cancer to immunotherapy. This model enables us to study the efficacy of different combinations of an epigenetic agent, the histone deacetylase inhibitor entinostat, and checkpoint inhibitors anti -programmed cell death protein (PD1) and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) antibodies, on tumor growth and metastatic progression, and to help identify co-stimulatory and inhibitory factors regulating T cell and MDSC responses. Characterization of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and their functional capabilities are being investigated in primary tumors and metastases using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immunohistochemistry. Thus far, there is a significant improvement in survival and delay in tumor growth in mice inoculated with neu expressing tumor cells treated with combination anti-PD1, anti-CTLA4 and entinostat as well as with anti-PD1 in combination with Entinostat. Preliminary results also suggest that epigenetic modulation with entinostat in combination with checkpoint inhibition improves the immune response within these tumors as evidenced by increased CD8+/T-regulatory cell infiltration, and increased monocytic-MDSCs into the TME. There are ongoing survival studies testing this combination therapy in mice inoculated with triple negative breast tumor cells. Future studies will further delineate the mechanisms by which epigenetic therapy alters the function of the inflammatory response to immunotherapy.']",

        "Background":"['Immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors that block immune suppressive mechanisms are transforming the way some cancers are treated. The identification of additional mechanisms that suppress immune cell function is stimulating the search for other immune modulating agents that are additive or synergistic with current immune checkpoint inhibitors or are capable of overcoming mechanisms of resistance and tolerance. Extracellular adenosine and its signaling through A2AR increases the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs), and attenuates tumor-specific CD4+/CD8+ T cells. In this study we evaluated the role of a small-molecule inhibitor of A2AR in enhancing antitumor immunity against murine Her-2/neu (neu)-expressing breast cancer. We examined whether an A2AR inhibitor would enhance the activity of cancer specific CD8+ T cells when given with a T cell inducing vaccine. To test this, neu-expressing mammary tumor bearing HER-2/neu transgenic (Neu-N) mice were treated with low dose cyclophosphamide (Cy) to deplete Tregs followed one day later with a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and neu-expressing whole cell vaccine (GVAX). Mice were treated with the A2AR inhibitor, CPI-444, by oral gavage daily for twelve days. Mice also received adoptively transferred high-avidity nave neu-specific CD8+ T cells intravenously one day after vaccination. Mice were monitored for tumor progression, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were harvested from additional mice at multiple time points and analyzed for T cell activation by flow cytometry. Inflammatory changes in the tumor microenvironment were assessed by immunohistochemistry. We found that T cells adoptively transferred to mice together with Cy, a neu-targeted vaccine and CPI-444 are more effective at reducing established tumors and delaying tumor progression when compared with mice treated with Cy, vaccine, adoptively transferred T cells and vehicle control. Of particular note, mice receiving the same treatment but with CPI-444 in lieu of vehicle had a significant mean difference in tumor area of 6.446mm2 (P<0.05) when compared to the vaccine and vehicle control cohort. When compared to the tumor alone cohort, mice receiving the full therapeutic regimen had a significant mean difference in tumor area of 13.59mm2 (P<0.001). Mechanistic studies are underway to assess the activity of the adoptively transferred T cells in the TIL.

With the 2011 ASCO/CAP guidelines, the definition of TNBC has changed to exclude patients with ER low-positive (1-9%) tumors; hence patients with ER-low positive tumors (formerly considered ER negative) may not be referred for genetic counseling and BRCA testing.

While T cell responses to some tumors occur spontaneously, the majority of cancers are not naturally recognized by the immune system. The lack of response is attributed primarily to insufficient T cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment (TME). Activating the STING pathway represents one strategy for increasing infiltration of T cells into the TME. This induces interferon-β (IFN-β) production, leading to dendritic cell (DC) activation and priming of tumor antigen specific CD8+ T cells that mediate tumor regression. The intratumoral injection (IT) of ML-RR-S2-CDA (ADU-S100), a synthetic cyclic dinucleotide STING agonist, has antitumor efficacy in several aggressive mouse tumor models, including B16 melanoma, CT26 colon carcinoma, Panc02 pancreatic carcinoma, and 4T1 triple negative breast cancer.

We have also compared the FSHR expression with the receptor status of three most important markers for breast cancer diagnosis and therapy (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2/neu). By using a highly specific monoclonal antibody raised against the human FSHR, we determined the density of FSHR-positive vessels in a band with a width of 10 mm (centered on the demarcation line between the tumor and the normal breast tissue) on the tissue sections by standard peroxidase-immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. We examined 35 patients of Luminal A, 13 patients of Luminal B, 19 patients of HER-2 positive, and 16 patients of Triple negative/basal breast cancer.

No correlation was found between the percentage of FSHR-positive vessels and the expression of receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and HER-2/neu.In conclusion, our data show that', ' (i) FSHR is robustly expressed in breast cancer, and (ii) the main types of breast cancers and stages do not differ significantly in terms of vascular FSHR expression. These facts strongly increase FSHR potential relevance as a clinical target for breast cancer imaging and for therapy, especially for triple negative/basal breast cancers, a group with only chemotherapy options.']",

Although a humanized monoclonal antibody (Trastuzumab) against HER2 is currently considered one of the most effective treatments, a significant number of patients are initially or eventually become resistant to Trastuzumab based therapy. Here, we demonstrate that secreted phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI)/ autocrine motility factor (AMF), an orphan -CXXC- cytokine directly binds to HER2 and activates PI3K and MAPK through HER2 autophosphorylation, and also induces immediately HER2 cleavage in metalloprotease dependent fashion.

By integrating bioinformatics with traditional genetics, we have addressed the hypothesis that genetic events mediating breast cancer metastasis can be elucidated from mouse models. To test this hypothesis, we assembled a gene expression database of over 1100 mouse breast cancers from 23 different models. Using this database, E2F transcription factors were predicted to be strikingly activated in metastatic mouse models. Transgenic MMTV-Neu mice were interbred with E2F transcription factor knockouts to test this hypothesis. Tumor latency was increased significantly with the loss of any of the activator E2Fs in the MMTV-Neu mice. Strikingly, there was also a significant reduction in the extent of pulmonary metastasis with loss of either E2F1 or E2F2. This metastasis reduction was shown to be a cell autonomous effect through a transplant experiment. Moreover, CD-31 staining revealed vasculature alterations with E2F loss. These data led to the hypothesis that E2F transcription factors were critical in mediating metastasis. Highly metastatic MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice also had predicted E2F transcription factor activation. Genetically testing this prediction, we noted that PyMT transgenic mice lacking E2F1 or E2F2 recapitulated the MMTV-Neu results with a vast reduction in metastasis. Using a tail vein injection we noted defects in extravasation with E2F1 or E2F2 loss. To determine the mechanism by which E2Fs regulated metastatic progression, we examined gene expression profiles of MMTV-Neu and PyMT tumors in both control and E2F knockout backgrounds. This analysis identified a cohort of genes with reduced expression in the non-metastatic E2F knockout breast cancers relative to the metastatic wild type E2F controls. Importantly, genes identified in the mouse model system are co-amplified in human HER2+ breast cancer but are not part of the HER2 amplicon. This amplicon is present in over 30% of HER2+ human breast cancers and is inversely associated with metastasis free survival. In addition to examining the amplicon genes in HER2+ human breast cancer, we have also examined predicted E2F activity using genomic signatures. This revealed four common combinations of E2F activity in HER2+ breast cancer. Importantly, low E2F1 and high E2F2 in the same sample was associated with far better relapse free survival than the opposite E2F pattern. These data indicate that the effects and the mechanisms uncovered in the mouse models are present in HER2+ human breast cancer. Taken together, by integrating bioinformatics with mouse models of breast cancer we have demonstrated that the E2F transcription factors play a pivotal role in progression from primary breast cancer to metastasis.']",

The last several years of research have drawn attention to many such therapeutics and strategies. Adenosine is an abundant extracellular signaling molecule in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of many cancers. Signal transduction through the GPCR A2AR enhances the immunosuppressive activity of Tregs while simultaneously attenuating tumor-specific CD4+/CD8+ T cells. We have evaluated the appropriate coordination and dosing for a small-molecule inhibitor of A2AR in a Her-2/neu expressing murine model of breast cancer. We have demonstrated its capacity to augment existing therapeutic strategies in this tolerant model. To test our hypotheses on the ability of the small molecule to work in concert with existing therapeutics, we tested the role of CPI-444 when given with a T cell-inducing vaccine. Neu-expressing mammary tumor bearing HER-2/neu transgenic (Neu-N) mice were administered combinations of low-dose cyclophosphamide (Cy) to deplete Tregs, followed one day later with a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and neu-expressing whole cell vaccine (GVAX). The day following administration of GVAX, mice received adoptively transferred high-avidity naïve neu-specific CD8+ T cells intravenously one day after vaccination. Administration of specific components in this strategy (i.e. Cy, GVAX, adoptive transfer) were altered to gain insight into the mechanistic effects of CPI-444 in vivo through analysis of tumor progression, tumor clearance, and flow cytometric analysis of the TIL. Mice treated with the A2AR inhibitor or the vehicle control were administered each by oral gavage daily for 14 days (survival) or until 4 days post-adoptive transfer (TIL) at the peak infiltrate time. Of the strategies tested, Cy, followed by concomitant administration of GVAX with 100mg/kg of CPI-444 for 14 days, and a single adoptive therapy treatment provided a 55% overall survival (OS) compared with 0%-20% OS in vehicle controls (P<0.005). Further, we have observed both broad and specific changes in the T cell compartment of the tumor-infiltrating leukocyte (TIL) population. Broadly we have observed a refinement in the T cell portion of the TIL with decreased numbers of T cells overall, but an increase in specific prognostic ratios, namely a relative increase in favorability of the CD8+', 'Treg ratio when compared to controls (P<0.05).

For this reason, HER-2/neu has been actively pursued as a target for novel therapeutic agents. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), a new class of antitumor drugs, can downregulate HER2 through hyperacetylation of heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), an important ATP-dependent chaperone that mediates the stability and maturation of a variety of important oncogenic proteins, including HER2, Akt and ER. In this study, we assess the effects of OSU-HDAC42, a novel orally bioavailable phenylbutyrate-based HDAC inhibitor, on hsp90 and HER2 downregulation. Methods', ' OSU-HDAC42 was tested for effects on the human breast cancer cell lines BT474, SKBR3, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. Assays of cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, HER2 expression, phosphorylation, and hsp90 acetylation were performed. Tumor growth was assessed in an orthotopic HER2+ mammary tumor model, using diets  OSU-HDAC42. Results', ' SKBR3 (HER2+, ER-) was the most susceptible to the antiproliferative effects of OSU-HDAC42 after 72 hours of treatment (IC50 = 0.025 mol/L), followed by BT474 (HER2+, ER+), MCF-7 (HER2-, ER+) and MDA-MB-231 (HER2-, ER-) cells with IC50 values calculated at 0.16, 0.19 and 0.2 mol/L, respectively, which correlated with the level of inhibition of Hsp90 client protein expression (HER2, Akt). OSU-HDAC42 yields 43- or 65- fold greater cell killing than suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; vorinostat) or MS-275, respectively, and more potently suppresses the levels of Hsp90 client proteins (HER2, ER and Akt) and induction of apoptosis in HER2+ breast cancer cells. In vivo administration of OSU-HDAC42 resulted in reductions of 76% and 82% in NT5 (HER2+,ER-) tumor mass and volume, respectively, concomitant with tubulin hyperacetylation, increased PARP cleavage, and decreased HER2 levels in OSU-HDAC42 treated mouse tumors. Conclusions', ' OSU-HDAC42 is a potent inhibitor of HER2+ breast cancer, mediated in part through hsp90 downregulation.

Up to 20% of breast and gastric cancer show ERBB2 gene amplification and anti-HER2 targeting therapies are well established for these tumors. In other tumor entities such as lung cancer, colorectal cancer and bladder cancer the fraction of ERBB2 amplified tumors is considerably lower. In contrast to breast cancer, these tumors show heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification in a substantial proportion.

Tumor DNA was extracted and examined for mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (exons 18-23) of the ERBB2 gene by Sanger sequencing. Results', '  ERBB2 mutation was found in two metastatic lesions of breast cancer, two lung cancers and two colorectal cancers. In five of these cases short in-frame insertions in exon 20 were found.

The semi-quantitative chromatograms show an overrepresentation of the mutations indicating a selective amplification of the mutated allele. Conclusions', '  In certain tumor entities the heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification indicates a late genetic event. The finding of a concomitant mutation in ERBB2 amplified tumors might explain the heterogeneity in some of these tumors.

The present study not only demonstrates chemoprevention of breast cancer in rats by the Ayurvedic medicine phytochemical withaferin A (WA) but also identifies its mechanistic biomarkers common to different subtypes of this disease. Chemopreventive efficacy of WA (4 and 8 mg per kg body weight) was determined using a rat model of breast cancer induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). The mechanisms underlying breast cancer chemoprevention by WA were elucidated by western blotting, biochemical assays, immunohistochemistry, and cytokine profiling using plasma and tumors from the MNU-rat and/or mouse mammary tumor virus-neu (MMTV-neu) models. Inhibitory effect of WA on exit from mitosis and leptin-induced oncogenic signaling was determined using MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Incidence, multiplicity, and burden of MNU-induced breast cancer in rats were decreased by WA administration. For example, the tumor weight in the 8 mg per kg group was lower by 67% compared with controls (P = 0.004). Mitotic arrest and apoptosis induction were common determinants of breast cancer chemoprevention by WA in the MNU-rat and MMTV-neu models. Cytokine profiling showed suppression of plasma leptin levels by WA in rats. WA inhibited leptin-induced oncogenic signaling in cultured MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. WA is a promising phytochemical with the ability to inhibit at least two different subtypes of breast cancer, including neu-driven estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer in MMTV-neu model and MNU-induced ER+ breast cancer in rats.

The LDL receptor (LDLR) is the main receptor for cholesterol uptake into cells from circulating LDL and its expression is higher in HER2 positive breast cancers than other subtypes. The aim of our study was to understand the importance of the LDLR in the progression of HER2 positive breast cancer growth in the setting of hyperlipidemia. To study the role of hyperlipidemia in HER2 cancer progression, we used two mouse models with elevated LDL cholesterol', ' Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE-/-), and LDLR knockout (LDLR-/-) mice on an FVB/n background. ApoE-/-, LDLR-/- and control (WT) mice were placed on a western diet at 8-10 weeks of age. After 2 weeks on the diet, serum cholesterol concentrations were measured and demonstrated significantly higher cholesterol levels in the ApoE-/- and LDLR-/- mice compared with WT mice (WT', ' 208±19mg/dL; LDLR-/-', ' 488±37mg/dL; ApoE-/- 660±39mg/dL). We used the MCNeuA (MMTV-Neu derived) breast cancer cells to study the effect of hyperlipidemia on Her2/Neu positive breast cancer in this model, as the MCNeuA cells were found to have high levels of LDLR protein expression compared with other murine breast cancer cell lines. To study the importance of the LDLR in mediating the effects of hyperlipidemia, we knocked down the LDLR in the MCNeuA cells using shRNA, and selected two cell clones with successful gene knockdown confirmed by RNA and protein analysis. ApoE-/-, LDLR-/- and WT mice on the western diet were injected into the 4th mammary fat pad with 2 x 106 MCNeuA (MMTV-Neu derived) control shRNA or MCNeuA LDLR knockdown clone 1 or clone 2 cells (n=6-10 mice per group). Tumor growth was measured for 30 days. Control shRNA tumors in both hyperlipidemic mouse genotypes grew more rapidly than in the WT mice. 30 days after injection the control tumor volumes were', ' WT 514±66.5mm3; LDLR-/- 767±78.2mm3; ApoE-/- 1189±94mm3. The LDLR knockdown clones 1 and 2 had a reduction of tumor volume of 11% and 30% in the WT mice, 28% and 62% in LDLR-/- mice, and 26% and 53% in the ApoE-/- mice, respectively compared with the control shRNA cells. Western blot analysis of tumor protein lysates showed an increase in p19 cleaved caspase 3 in the tumors with LDLR knockdown, compared with the control cells. In vitro studies demonstrated a decrease in survival of MCNeuA cells with LDLR knockdown in serum starved conditions, and an increase in caspase 3 cleavage. These data demonstrate that hyperlipidemia promotes the growth of Her2/Neu overexpressing breast cancer cells and the LDLR plays an important role in protecting Her2 / Neu tumors from apoptosis. Therefore, targeting cholesterol uptake and metabolism may be an important strategy for women with HER2 positive breast cancers.']",

HER2 overexpression (HER2+) can be detected in up to 60% early stage breast lesions, such as atypical hyperplasia (ADH) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Up to 40% of ER- breast cancers are HER2+. Thus, targeting HER2 signaling may be an effective chemoprevention strategy for these ER- and HER2+ breast cancer. Here, we stable introduced ErbB2-expressing retroviruses into the ER-, non-transformed MCF10A cells (MCF10A.B2) to establish an ER- and HER2+ early breast disease model. We show that Lapatinib, a FDA-approved dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor for both HER2 and EGFR, reduced the proliferation rate and increased the apoptosis in MCF10A.B2 cells. In 3D culture, Lapatinib treatment starting at day 6 prevented the MCF10A.B2 cells from forming abnormal acini, and the numbers of DCIS-like acini have been significantly decreased compared to control group. Untreated MCF10A.B2 cells forms DCIS-like acini in 3D culture by day 10, which have been reverted to normal or ADH-like acini when lapatinib treatment started by day 10. Furthermore, MMTV-neu mouse model develop ER- mammary tumors in 6.4 months, whereas lapatinib treatment (30mg/kg/day, six days per week) starting at 10 weeks of age significantly delayed the tumor initiation and progression in this mouse model as detected by mammary gland biopsy and fiber optic micro-endoscope (FOME) imaging. Mice treated with lapatinib had fewer premalignant lesions and reduced noninvasive tumors in their mammary glands, which are correlated with reduced proliferation rate and increased apoptosis rate, indicating that lapatinib is a promising agent for the prevention/intervention of ER- and HER2+ breast cancers. To identify effective and reliable biomarkers to assess the risk of ER-/HER2+ lesions and efficacy of lapatinib for prevention and intervention, cDNA microarray and reverse phase protein array (RPPA) were performed on MCF10A.B2 cells and control MCF10A cells. We have identified several molecular pathways activated by HER2+ in this model which will be tested for their roles in the initiation of mammary tumors and as potential targets for prevention of ER-/HER2+ breast disease.

Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is a special interest cancer since it represents a significant proportion of breast cancer patients and is associated with a poorer prognosis. We aimed to determine the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and Her2/neu receptor characteristics of breast cancers and the prevalence of TNBC diagnosed at Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi (AKUHN) between 2007 to date.  Methods', '    Slides and blocks of archived invasive breast cancers diagnosed at AKUHN were identified, retrieved and reviewed by two independent pathologists. Histological type, grade and pathological stage were documented.  Representative sections from available blocks were stained for ER, PR, Her2 with appropriate internal controls.  Scores for ER/PR were interpreted based on the ALLRED system, Her2 /neu scoring followed CAP guidelines.  The initial 111 cases were validated and confirmed at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto.  Results', '    456 cases of invasive breast cancers were diagnosed at AKUHN during the study period. 91% of cases were invasive ductal carcinomas (NOS).The rest were special types. 37% of the tumors were grade 3 and 63% were grade 2. Blocks for 318 of 456 cases were available for receptor analysis. 54% were ER and/or PR positive, with 52% of these in women < 50 yrs.  86% of the ER and/or PR positive tumors were grade 2. Only 12% were Her2/neu positive.   Of the 318 cases studied, 111 (32%) were identified as TNBC. Median age was 53 yrs. 88% were grade 3.  Conclusions', '    Invasive ductal carcinoma (NOS) was the most common breast cancer in our study. Nearly half of our cases were ER and/or PR positive and a third were TNBC.

A majority of advanced HER-2 positive breast cancer patients will develop resistance to the therapy within the first year while many others do not respond to the drug when used alone. The purpose of this study was to determine whether AZD8931, a reversible pan-ERBB inhibitor that equipotently inhibits the tyrosine kinase-activity of EGFR, HER-2, and HER-3, could reverse this resistance in established trastuzumab-resistant BT474 and SKBR3 cell lines.

Using combination indices, it was found that AZD8931 synergizes well with trastuzumab and could be used as a combination therapy for both trastuzumab-sensitive and trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer patients. Western blot analyses confirmed the results of cell proliferation assays as p-EGFR, p-HER-2, p-HER-3, p-Akt, and p-MAPK, were all reduced after treatment with AZD8931.

The present study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of PEITC for prevention of breast cancer using MMTV-neu mouse model. PEITC administration in the diet (3 mmol PEITC/kg AIN76A diet) for 29 weeks caused an approximate 27% decrease in incidence of mammary hyperplasia compared with control, but the difference between control and PEITC treatment groups did not reach statistical significance. On the other hand, incidence of palpable tumors was reduced by about 53% by PEITC administration (P= 0.07 by two-sided Fisher's exact test). Moreover, size of microscopic carcinoma lesions was significantly lower in mice fed PEITC-supplemented diet compared with those fed basal diet (P= 0.05 by two-sided Fisher's exact test). Average body weight of the PEITC-fed mice was modestly but significantly higher than that of control mice at earlier time points (weeks 1-7) but this differential was not observed at later time points (weeks 8-29). Diet consumption was comparable for mice placed on basal diet and PEITC-supplemented diet. Mean PEITC concentration in the plasma and tumor tissue was 901 nM (95% confidence interval- 741-1060 nM) and 87 nmol/kg (95% confidence interval- 67-107 nmol/kg), respectively. Expression of HER-2 oncoprotein as well as number of CD31-positive blood vessels in the tumor did not differ between control and PEITC treatment groups. On the other hand, tumors from PEITC treatment group exhibited about 46% decrease in Ki-67 expression in comparison with control (P= 0.01). Consistent with cellular observations, number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic bodies was about 4.4-fold higher in the tumors of PEITC-fed mice as compared with controls (P= 0.01). Pulmonary metastasis was evident in 3/35 control mice but only 1/32 mice placed on PEITC-supplemented diet exhibited microscopic evidence of metastasis. Size of pulmonary metastasis was also smaller in the PEITC treatment group compared with control.

        "Background":"['Breast cancer is the most common malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer related death in women. HER2+ over-expressing (HER2+) tumors comprise 20% to 25% of all cases and are associated with a poor prognosis. The discovery of HER2 monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics has greatly improved patient prognosis. However, patients suffer relapse and de novo resistance. Thus it is important to determine additional therapeutic targets in HER2+ breast cancer that might be used in combination with current therapies to improve patient survival. SHP2 (PTPN11) is a non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) that contains two SH2 domains at its N-terminus, a central PTP domain and a C-terminal proline-rich tail. Previous studies suggest that Shp2 is required for Ras/Erk signaling downstream of most growth factor receptors and integrins. Heterozygous germ-line PTPN11 mutations cause Noonan Syndrome and LEOPARD syndrome, which are associated with leukemia and cancer predisposition. Somatic PTPN11 mutations cause juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and several other neoplasms. We have discovered that Shp2 is required in Neu-mediated tumorigenesis in the MMTV-NIC mouse model; furthermore, SHP2-depleted human HER2+ BT-474 has defective tumorigenesis in nude mice. SHP2 is required in anchorage-independent growth in 4 HER2+ breast cancer cell lines, though its effect on growth on plastics appears minimal. I hypothesize that SHP2 is required for HER2+ breast tumor initiation and maintenance. I further hypothesize that SHP2 functions through specific substrates/interacting proteins in HER2+ breast cancer cells, possibly molecules that are involved in anchorage-independent proliferation.']",

        "Background":"['Repeated DNA segments (Low Copy Repeats, Segmental Duplications) are highly homologous sequences within the human genome. They are typically 10-300 kb in length, and bear >95% sequence identity. In germline, repeated DNA segments mediate recurrent DNA rearrangements and thus cause specific genetic disorders called genomic disorders. Repeated genomic segments could also be prone to rearrangements in somatic cells and thus could mediate recurrent rearrangements in cancer. However, the important role of repeated genomic segments in genome instability in cancer remains elusive, mainly because such regions are less accessible by current genomic technologies due to the difficulty in assembling and interrogating sequences. Gene amplification is a cellular process characterized by the production of multiple copies of a particular gene through DNA rearrangements. ERBB2, an epidermal growth factor receptor gene, is amplified in 15-20% of breast tumors. Due to excessive cell growth signaling, this recurrent amplification is associated with advanced stages and poor prognosis. Despite the clinical importance, the mechanisms giving rises to recurrent ERBB2 amplification remains unclear. We hypothesized that, similar to the recurrent rearrangements for genomic disorders, repeated genomic segments cause DNA rearrangements for ERBB2 amplification. To test the hypothesis and understand the mechanism of ERBB2 amplification, we mapped a common copy-number breakpoint for primary ERBB2-amplified (HER2-positive) breast tumors. Copy number breakpoints were examined at every 300-kilo bases (kb) from the location of ERBB2 to its telomeric region using real-time PCR based assays. The breakpoint that marked a region between normal copy number and low level amplification resided within a 300-kb complex genomic region at the 1.5 mega-bases telomeric side of ERBB2. The region contains many repeated segments from two gene families. Furthermore, the HapMap SNPs, a set of SNPs that tag haploblocks in the human genome, are less well-defined, indicating the difficulty in interrogating the genomic region by current genomic technologies. Normal copy-number variations seem common, as there is several deletion polymorphisms reported in the region. Two sub-regions, each covering 40-kb region, are particularly complex due to a number of direct and inverted repeats. The prevalence of this copy number breakpoint in HER2-positive breast tumors was also shown in a study by Sircoulomb et al.,(BMC Cancer 2010), in which common amplifications and deletions were determined for 54 HER-2 positive breast tumors. Defining (1) the copy-number breakpoint with very high resolution and (2) critical DNA sequences for ERBB2 amplification will lead to better understanding the amplification mechanism underlying this aggressive type of breast cancer.']",

        "Background":"['In this study we demonstrate that gain of HER-2/Neu expression in human breast cancer xenografts harboring constitutive active Raf-1 induces Aurora-A over-expression that ultimately drives the transition from a luminal to a highly invasive basal-like phenotype. Over-expression of Aurora-A was induced by phosphorylation and protein stabilization by HER-2/Neu rather than increased Aurora-A gene expression. Moreover, Aurora-A stabilization induced an increase of HER-2/Neu expression in breast cancer cells defining a novel positive feed-back loop between Aurora-A and HER-2/Neu oncogenic signaling pathways. Basal-like tumor cells over-expressing Aurora-A and HER-2/Neu underwent to loss of CD24 surface receptor, expressed epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and acquired stem cell-like properties such as mammospheres formation and self-renewal. Pharmacologic inhibition of HER-2/Neu signaling pathway with lapatinib in cancer cells over-expressing Aurora-A demonstrated that Aurora-A was downstream to HER-2/Neu in the development of EMT and stemness. To determine whether Aurora-A induced a cancer stem cell-like phenotype through development of chromosomal instability and tumor cell phenotypic heterogeneity, we performed a SKY analysis on the breast cancer cell lines employed in this study. Our results demonstrate that invasive breast cancer cells harboring a basal-like phenotype did not develop higher chromosomal instability compared to luminal non-invasive cancer cells, signifying that Aurora-A has a direct effect on the development of basal-like breast cancer cells with stemness properties. Importantly, pharmacologic inhibition of Aurora-A kinase activity with the small molecule MLN8237 restored CD24 expression and reversed EMT leading to the re-establishment of a luminal phenotype and suppression of distant metastases. Our findings implicate for the first time the mitotic kinase Aurora-A in the development and maintenance of CD24 negative basal-like tumor stem cells responsible for breast cancer recurrence and progression. These observations have also important implications for the development of molecular targeted therapies to inhibit Aurora-A kinase activity and stemness improving the overall survival of breast cancer patients.']",

This is partly due to their inability to cross the blood brain barrier. Trials with bevacizumab, a VEGF inhibitor that disrupts tumor angiogenesis, have demonstrated activity against this otherwise chemotherapy resistant disease. This has led to interest in other biologic agents that target angiogenic pathways for the treatment of GBM. Over-expression of HER-2/neu by human tumor cells is closely associated with increased angiogenesis and expression of VEGF. Lapatinib is a recently available low molecular weight immunotherapeutic agent that targets HER-2/neu proteins. In a recent study, breast cancer patients treated with lapatinib and capcitabine had decreased brain metastases indicating that lapatinib may cross the blood brain barrier and thus have potential in the treatment of malignant gliomas. Limited studies have evaluated HER-2/neu gene expression in GBM and the results are inconsistent. We evaluated the expression of Her-2/neu protein in 41 consecutive GBM cases to explore the potential utility of targeting this pathway. Methods', ' Archival histopathologic sections from 41 patients (age 26-89 years) with a diagnosis of GBM from 2004-2008 were reviewed. The diagnosis was confirmed and optimal sections were selected.

        "Background":"['Despite the initial success of common HER2 inhibitors used in the clinic, including trastuzumab and lapatinib, HER2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer cells often acquire resistance through mechanisms that continue to remain poorly understood. A number of signaling molecules, which act downstream of HER2, including PI3K, Akt, JNK, and Hormonally-Upregulated Neu-associated Kinase (Hunk), are thought to contribute to resistance. Our recent studies indicate that targeting Hunk via shRNA in HER2+breast cancer cells that are sensitive to HER2 inhibitors (BT474) and cells that are resistant (JIMT) leads to increased caspase-3 activity in vitro and impaired tumor growth in vivo. In addition, we find that targeting Hunk not only sensitizes HER2+ cells to apoptosis, but also impairs autophagy, as indicated by decreased LC3BII expression, the lipidated form of LC3B which signifies active autophagy. Because elevated Hunk protein expression correlates with poorer prognosis, and since Hunk knockdown impairs autophagy, it is possible that Hunk acts to upregulate autophagy thereby contributing to the development of resistance. We have also found that the kinase JNK plays a role in resistance in HER2+ breast cancer cells, and demonstrate that JNK inhibition via a pan-JNK inhibitor impairs tumor growth of JIMT cells. We further show that co-targeting of JNK and HUNK results in greater cell death and significantly reduced tumor growth than either individual treatment in the JIMT-1, HER2+ resistant cell line, as well as a HER2+ line that was engineered to be lapatinib resistant, BT474-LR. Overall, our results indicate that targeting Hunk in HER2+ breast cancer not only alters autophagy and impairs tumor growth, but that co-targeting Hunk and JNK shows greater therapeutic effects on reducing tumor growth and inducing cell death.']",

        "Background":"['About 20% of non-castrated female domestic cats develop malignant mammary tumors with similar histopathology and disease progression as human breast cancer. Her2 over-expression is reported in 40-85% of feline mammary carcinomas, indicating this disease is particularly suited for testing Her2 DNA vaccination. To corroborate these findings, expression of Her2 was evaluated in 4 feline mammary tumors resected from three feline patients. Immunohistochemistry analysis with anti-human Her2 mAb showed regions of intense membrane staining in all four tumor samples, indicating high frequency of Her2 expression among feline mammary tumors and immune cross-reactivity of human and feline Her2. Feline mammary tumor lines K248 (Minke, et. al. 1991) and K12 (Modiano, et. al. 1991) both express Her2 as measured by flow cytometry, further demonstrating Her2 as a common antigen in feline mammary tumors. Feline Her2 cDNAs cloned from K248 and K12 (GenBank Accession JN990983) are identical to each other and show 93% sequence identity with human Her2. To test the feasibility of conducting DNA electrovaccination in cats, 3 pathogen-free domestic short hair cats between 1-2 years of age were injected i.m. in the biceps femoris of the hind legs or triceps of the front legs with vaccine DNA. Each cat received admix of 1.5mg of pE2Neu encoding a hybrid human Her2 and rat neu fusion protein and 1.5mg of feline pGM-CSF. Each injection site was subjected to electroporation with a NEPA21 electroporator, consisting of three 50msec 100V degenerating bipolar pulses. The vaccination was repeated at 3 week intervals and blood was drawn 2 weeks after each vaccination. Anti-human Her2 antibody was detected in the immune serum after 2 vaccinations, as demonstrated by binding to SKOV3 cells that over-express human Her2. After 4 vaccinations, anti-human Her2 antibody titers ranged from 50,000 to 200,000. Therefore, DNA electrovaccination is an effective means to induce immune response in cats. To test if immunization with heterologous pE2Neu induced cross-reactive antibody to self feline Her2, immune serum was incubated with 3T3/fHer2 cells that express feline Her2. Specific binding to 3T3/fHer2 was observed after 3 vaccinations at 1', '100 serum dilutions.

Higher avidity T cells have been shown to be more strongly affected by tolerance signals leaving the potential for lower avidity T cells to be effective. These signals as well as co-regulatory signals strongly affect T cell activation, function, and survival in vivo. Our study aims to identify tolerance mechanisms and co-regulatory signals in lower avidity CD8+ T cells as compared to other cells within a T cell repertoire specific for the same cancer antigen. We used the HER-2/neu (neu-N) transgenic mouse model of spontaneous mammary tumors. Vaccines targeted at the HER-2/neu protein induce T cell responses of differing avidities against the immunodominant epitope RNEU420-429. We created high and low avidity TCR transgenic mice whose high and low avidity tumor-specific T cells can be tracked in the tolerized HER-2/neu mice in vivo. T cells from the high and low avidity TCR transgenic mice were adoptively transferred into neu-N mice under different treatment conditions to evaluate changes in protein expression. Treatment groups included', ' tumor alone, tumor plus a GM-CSF secreting whole cell vaccine, and tumor plus vaccine plus the T regulatory cell (Treg) depleting agent cyclophosphamide. The combination of the Treg depleting agent and vaccine allows the activation of high avidity T cells including the ability of those T cells to reject tumor. Low avidity T cells do not reject tumor with any of these treatments. We used microarrays to compare gene expression between the high and low avidity T cells in tolerant and non-tolerant environments and found several genes with higher expression in the low avidity Tcells. In particular, cell death pathways were upregulated in the low avidity T cells when compared with high avidity T cells in a tolerant environment. The specific molecules within the cell death pathways that showed the most distinction were CD24, FasL, and DR5. Further analysis confirmed that protein expression of these molecules was also increased on low avidity T cells. We also found that these molecules are more highly expressed on T cells undergoing apoptosis. The increases in proteins involved the cell death pathway on low avidity T cells correlates with our finding that in tolerant mice lower avidity T cells have a shorter survival than higher avidity T cells. These studies also show that T cells expressing these death proteins secrete less effector cytokines, including IFN, than T cells that do not express them. Currently these proteins are being targeted therapeutically to determine if the survival and function of low avidity T cells can be altered. Thus, this study should identify novel combinatorial immune-based treatments to enhance the overall anti-tumor activity of cancer vaccines.']",

Trastuzumab, a large molecule monoclonal antibody directed against the HER-2/neu receptor (overexpressed on some breast cancers, glioblastomas, and medulloblastomas), has negligible access to the CSF after intravenous administration. Intra-CSF administration could circumvent this barrier. Methods', ' Sixteen patients with neoplastic meningitis (11 GBM, 4 breast cancer, 1 medulloblastoma) and progressive neurologic deterioration were treated with intra-CSF trastuzumab (20-60 mg per dose, either weekly or every other week) for four treatments.

Patients who were neurologically and radiographically stable or improved after four treatments were continued on every other week therapy until neurologic progression. CSF cytology, neurologic status, and KPS were assessed at each treatment. MRI scanning of sites of previously demonstrated leptomeningeal tumor was performed after four treatments and then at 8 week intervals. HER-2/neu status of the primary tumors was also evaluated. Results', ' Two of the four patients with breast cancer (both HER-2/neu+) are responding clinically and cytologically 4 and 14 weeks after initiating treatment.

To investigate the effects of constitutively decreased TGFBR1 signaling on cancer development, we developed a novel mouse model of Tgfbr1 haploinsufficiency to mimic the decreased TGFBR1 signaling observed in individuals with higher risk of cancer. Using this model, we demonstrated that Apcmin;Tgfbr1+/- mice develop more than twice as many intestinal tumors as Apcmin controls.

The proliferation of actively growing human ER+ or triple negative breast cancer cells was significantly reduced by MGE from grape seeds or skins with an associated decrease in phospho-ERK, suggesting that MGE inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation through a reduction in activation of growth-promoting kinases. Female FVB-Tg(MMTV)NKAMul/J transgenic mice with an activated rat Erbb2 oncogene expressed specifically in the mammary gland (c-neu mice) form mammary tumors by 6-8 months of age. c-Neu mice were treated with MGE in the drinking water (approximately 1.0 mg phenolics/25 g mouse) beginning at weaning and were sacrificed at 7 months of age. No changes were observed in eating or drinking habits or in gross body, heart or kidney weight, suggesting that the MGE was well tolerated. Although all of the mice developed breast tumors, MGE significantly reduce tumor burden compared to the tumor tissue in mice drinking regular water (9.21.2 g versus 3.61.4 g, p = 0.001, n = 8-10). A group of c-Neu mice were also sacrificed at 4 months of age, once tumors were palpable, to assess tumor multiplicity.

Tumor tissue sections from mice administered MGE had a significant decrease in the proliferation marker Ki67 compared to tumors from control animals [31092 versus 16670 immunoreactive cells/field, p = 0.002], in agreement with the reduction in proliferation observed in vitro. Tumor sections from c-neu mice were incubated with an antibody to the endothelial cell marker, CD34, and vessels were identified by a combination of morphology and positive CD34 immunoreactivity; MGE significantly reduced blood vessel density in breast tumor tissue compared to tumors from mice drinking regular water [5.70.6 versus 3.60.9, p = 0.022], suggesting that the grape extract attenuates tumor angiogenesis. Interstitial tumoral fibrosis was quantified in breast tumor tissue sections using picrosirius red, a nonspecific collagen stain. MGE treatment markedly decreased interstitial fibrosis as compared to the tumors from control animals [2.790.70% versus 0.140.04%, p = 0.0005], indicating that the extract reduces cancer-associated fibrosis in breast tumors.

Methods', '    Data were collected from records of BC patients treated at King Abdulaziz Medical City over 5 year period from 2002 to 2007, including clinical, demographic, and disease characteristics.  Data was analyzed using SPSS version 18.  Results', '    450 pathologically confirmed BC patients were identified. The median age of diagnosis was 47.8 years (13-84). The vast majority are Saudi 81%.  Most of the patients are overweight (32.5%) or obese (49.0%) whereas, over 21% of them are diabetic and 20% are hypertensive, 4.5% are nulliparous, and 59% have family history of malignancy. Only four patients have previous history of malignancy.  The most frequent presenting symptom is breast lump (85%) followed by axillary lump in (11%). The mean duration of symptoms was 348 days. Around 4.5% presented with bilateral tumors and the primary site of cancer was the right upper outer quadrent in nearly 40% of patients.  93% of cases are invasive ductal carcinoma and 7.1% are invasive lobular carcinoma. 2% are insitu tumor, 28% had localized disease, 35% regional involvement and 19% with distant metastasis while 16% were unknown.  Finally the ER and PR were positive in 39% and 33.5%, respectively and 29.5% had positive HER2 over expressed. 14.3% were triple negative (TNBC).  Conclusions', '    Patients with BC present at younger age and more advanced stage. The latter fact may be related to delay in seeking medical help in a timely fashion. Public outreach programs are underway to improve female awareness about the importance of screening and early detection.  Higher percentage of tumors over express HER2 neu while TNBC rate is similar to Western data.  High percentage of women has positive family history, overweight, and obesity which need further evaluation as BC risk factors.']",

We report our experience using NGS for the assessment of HER2 amplification in conjunction with the detection of potentially targetable mutations.   Methods', '    BCA samples ( > 10% tumor) were analyzed in a CLIA-certified lab using a hybrid capture-based NGS assay (MSK-IMPACT) designed to detect somatic genetic alterations in 341 genes, including copy number alterations. Tumor percentage and concurrent IHC/FISH results were recorded (using ASCO/CAP 2013 guidelines). Criteria for amplification by NGS were defined as a fold change (FC)   2, p-value <0.05.  Results', '    A total of 133 BCA samples (63 primaries, 70 mets) were analyzed. Compared to the combined IHC/FISH methodology, ERBB2 amplification status by NGS had an overall concordance of 97% (129/133) (sensitivity = 82%, specificity = 100%, PPV = 100%). Discordant cases showed low tumor purity, heterogeneous IHC staining, and/or low level amplification by FISH. One sample status post trastuzumab was negative by IHC but ERBB2 amplified by FISH (ratio 4.0) and NGS (FC 2.3). The assay also uncovered somatic alterations in 133 cancer genes including TP53, PIK3CA, CDH1 and ESR1. ER and PR IHC results were available for 94 cases; 1/13 triple negative cases showed an actionable PIK3CA E542K mutation. Of the 22 ERBB2 amplified cases, 6 had actionable PIK3CA mutations (H1047R or E545K); 4/6 were metastatic lesions in patients previously treated with trastuzumab.   Conclusions', '    HER2 status can be reliably determined by hybrid capture NGS methods and allows the concurrent testing for other potentially actionable genomic alterations, particularly in limited material.

The aim of this study was to examine the molecular pathology and receptor biology in Irish men with breast cancer. Methods', ' Ten patients with MBC were identified from 1997- 2008 from a single Irish hospital and the expression of the molecular markers were determined by immunochemistry. We examined the expression of oestrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PgR), HER-2/neu (EGFR 2), EGFR 1 and p53 mutation. Results', ' The majority of patients (8/10) were of ductal histologic type and similarly the majority were high grade (grade III - 7/10). All 10 patients had positivity of ER in tumours and in 9 of these 10, PgR was positive. No patients had (EGFR 2) HER-2 over-expression by immunochemistry or gene amplification. All 10 patients had negative staining for EGFR 1. Greater than 30% of tumour cells showed positive staining for p53, and thus by our criteria 6/10 patients were positive for p53 expression. Conclusions', ' Oestrogen receptor positivity was present in all our patients and this in keeping with the international literature which shows significantly higher ER positivity in male by comparison with female breast cancer. Both high levels of ER positivity and grade III tumours occurred in Irish MBC, in contrast to female patients where there is an inverse relationship between these pathological features. Since its first use in MBC tamoxifen remains the most potent endocrine therapy for male breast cancer. New molecular targeting agents (eg., histone deacetylase [HDAC]) inhibitors could have particular benefits in enhancing tamoxifen efficiency in MBC in view of the high levels of ER expression.

        "Background":"['Most women diagnosed with ovarian cancer initially present with metastatic disease characterized by peritoneal implants and ascites. Activation of inflammatory processes mediated by nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) is thought to be critical to the distinct clinical pattern of spread of ovarian tumors. However, the relative contribution of NF-B activity in tumor cells and host inflammatory cells to ovarian cancer progression remains unknown. Therefore, our goal was to develop and characterize model systems to investigate NF-B activity in these cell populations during ovarian tumorigenesis. To study the host NF-B response, ID8 mouse ovarian cancer cells were injected intra-peritoneally into C57BL/6 mice carrying an NF-B-dependent green fluorescent protein (GFP)/luciferase fusion transgene (NGL). In a reciprocal approach, ID8 cells stably expressing the NGL reporter (ID8-NGL) were injected into wild-type C57BL/6 mice to investigate NF-B activation in the developing tumor. Non-invasive imaging of the mice was performed by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of the NGL reporter and by positron emission tomography (PET-CT) imaging of abdominal tumor burden. Preliminary experiments confirmed these models were highly reproducible, with peritoneal-wide tumor dissemination accompanied by the onset of late-stage, irreversible ascites. Mice injected with ID8-NGL cells showed greater than 100-fold increase in NF-B reporter activity during tumor progression. There was a modest overall decrease in abdominal NF-B activity over time in ID8-injected NGL mice, although the possibility of masking effects of the ascites fluid on bioluminescence, and NF-B activity in specific host cell populations, need to be elaborated. These models will allow us to define the patterns of NF-B activity in the host-tumor microenvironment during ovarian cancer progression, and will provide a powerful platform for future preclinical investigation of novel therapeutic agents targeting NF-B in ovarian cancer.']",

Treated mice experienced tumor regression and importantly a concomitant serologic response was induced to an antigen that is expressed by BCSC even in Neu-antigen loss tumor cells. We generated a specific mAb (mAb2) reactive against a membrane antigen on BCSC tumorsphere cultures derived from NeuN spontaneous breast tumors but not the counterpart adherent cultures. In vivo administration of mAb2 inhibited progression of macroscopic primary tumors in Her-2/neu transgenic mice. We further observed that the molecule bound by mAb2 is expressed on proliferating but not growth-arrested C2D1-tumorspheres and this antigen is re-expressed when cells are digested into single cell suspension and re-fed with fresh medium. Similar results are observed with 4T1-tumorsphere cells, an additional breast cancer cell line arising initially in BALB/c mice. Interestingly, the target of mAb2 is also down-regulated following irradiation-induced growth arrest of tumor cells. To identify the antigen recognized by mAb2, cultured C2D1-tumorsphere or 4T1-tumorspheres were cells were lysed and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with mAb2. The proteins captured by mAb2 were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. The bands of interest were excised then subjected to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) analysis. A 40 KDa protein was detected in all five experiments from either C2D1-tumorsphere or 4T1-tumorsphere cells. Stomatin-like protein 2 (SLP-2) a 38.5 KDa protein was consistently identified whereas 14 other proteins were sporadically found. Western blots of mAb2 immunoprecipitates from C2D1 or 4T1-tumorsphere lysates were probed with two distinct commercial antibodies against SLP-2 and we confirmed its presence. To validate SLP-2 as the target, an expression vector was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells and FACS analysis demonstrated 19% positive cells versus 3.6% for un-transfected 3T3 cells. SLP-2 overexpression is associated with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis in several types of human tumors.

Immunocompetent transgenic mouse mammary tumor models that are genetically similar to human breast cancer subtypes may identify pre-invasive antigens because mice can be followed longitudinally. Comparing tumor growth characteristics in two mouse models (TgMMTV-neu is genetically similar to luminal B breast cancer and C3(1)tag is genetically similar to triple negative breast cancer) demonstrated that, similar to triple negative breast cancer, C3(1)Tag mice develop tumors earlier and tumors grow more rapidly than TgMMTV-neu tumors. Furthermore, C3(1)Tag tumors have increased CD8+/CD4+ ratio (p<0.05) similar to human triple negative tumors. Using these two mouse models, we identified putative pre-invasive breast cancer antigens present prior to tumor development by serologic analysis of recombinant cDNA expression libraries and serological analysis of chip-arrayed proteins. We identified 65 pre-invasive antigens that were present in mice that would develop cancer but not parental control mice. The goal of this study was to identify which of the 65 antigens were required for human breast cancer survival with the goal to develop a preventative multi-antigen polyepitope breast cancer vaccine.We chose the pre-invasive antigens necessary for human breast cancer tumor cell survival using a high throughput siRNA screen evaluating for increased apoptosis and decreased cell survival in either HER2 positive or triple negative human breast cancer cell lines with decreased expression of the target protein. Five of the antigens were essential for human breast cancer cell survival', ' VPS35, SERBP1, ARPC2, PDIA6, and KRT8.

In our recent studies we have shown that FACT is essential for the transcriptional activity of NF-B and Heat Shock Factor 1 and identified small molecules that inhibit activity of both transcription factors by causing functional inactivation of FACT.

We treated the MMTV-neu transgenic mice, in which mammary carcinomas are spontaneously developed due to estrogen receptor-regulated expression of the Her2 proto-oncogene, with Curaxin-137 to determine whether the drug has any toxic effect on normal tissues and/or impact on mammary carcinogenesis. Expression of FACT was elevated in the process of transformation in all models tested. Chronic administration of Curaxin-137 to MMTV-neu mice at doses not having any toxic effect, inhibited tumor onset, delayed tumor progression, and prolonged survival of mice in a dose-dependent manner.

Results', \" The incidence of monitored phenotypes and other data are included in the table. An unambiguous dependence between the tumor's phenotype and the following attributes has been proven\", ' a) interval between the disease diagnosis and the 1st metastatic event (DFS); b) interval between the 1st metastatic event and the metastases in the CNS (TTPcns); c) characteristics of CNS dissemination. The CNS dissemination was the most extensive in patients with HER-2+ tumors in comparison with HER-2 negat. carcinomas. Surprisingly, patients with triple-negative tumors had the minimal metastatic involvement of CNS defined by size and number of lesions. Phenotype did not correlate with local response to therapy and OScns. The OScns has been significantly prolonged by neurosurgery (median 13,8 vs 2,4 months, p<0.0001) and when the effective local treatment was followed by system treatment (6,1 vs 1,9 months, p<0.0001). Conclusions', ' Our study has confirmed the dependence between primary tumor phenotype and the time of incidence of metastatic brain affection and character of their spread. Our results encourage the inclusion of CNS imaging examination (CT or MRI) into the regular restaging of patients with HER2 positive and triple-negative primary breast cancer, who are at high risk for early development of CNS dissemination.

Results', ' Supervised analysis of gene expression data coming from the 3 treated cell lines showed significant upregulation of multiple MYC gene signatures. Therefore, we constitutively overexpressed MYC using lentiviral MYC shRNA in SKBR3 and MCF7, and MYC overexpression made cell lines more resistant to ENT. In MMTV-Neu mice, both MYC gene mRNA and gene signatures were downregulated while cells responded to ENT, and became upregulated when the tumors progressed. aCGH CN analysis revealed that a large portion of mouse Chromosome 4 had DNA CN loss and low gene expression in tumors that progressed while on ENT. Within this region, JUN was computationally identified to be a top driver gene associated with resistance. JUN was next knocked down using lentiviral JUN shRNA in BT474 and T47D, and JUN knock-down repeatedly made cell lines more resistant to ENT. MYC gene-expression was also upregulated in JUN-knockdown BT474 and T47D. Finally, JUN CN loss was found in 22% (132/588) of luminal tumors in The Genome Cancer Atlas breast cancer, and all the MYC signature scores were significantly higher in JUN-deleted TCGA samples.

There was no significant difference found in types of patients, NAT regimen, or pCR rates before and after the pathway was introduced.  Conclusions', '   Practice patterns at the OCC in NAT for breast cancer remained unchanged before and after development of a clinical care pathway, which was meant to standardize the approach to and to possibly increase the use of NAT from beyond LABC to higher-risk EBC.

Methods', '  We identified 540 patients with HER2+ breast cancer treated with T or lapatinib as part of their first-line treatment for metastatic disease from 01/1997 to 11/2011. HER-2 positivity was assessed by immunohistochemistry (score, 3+) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (HER2/CEP17 ratio  2). We excluded 17 patients from this analysis because they were either lost to follow-up or received less than 2 cycles of therapy at the institution.

Although breast carcinomas in both genders share certain pathological features, notable differences have been observed regarding incidence, prognosis and survival. Results from microarray analyses in our studies and those of other reports were used to select 33 candidate genes to investigate in male breast carcinomas. Tumor marker results for 99 male breast cancers and 18,000 female breast carcinomas were extracted from our IRB-approved comprehensive database. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progestin receptor (PR) levels were determined by either radio-ligand binding (NEN/DuPont) or enzyme immunoassay (Abbott Labs). HER-2/neu levels were determined by either ELISA (Oncogene Science) or EIA (Triton Biosciences), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) levels were determined by an in-house radio-ligand competition assay. RNA was isolated from tissue sections of de-identified frozen biopsies from 12 male patients and 233 female patients using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and analyzed for quality and quantity (Agilent Bioanalyzer). cDNA for qPCR measurements was prepared in Tris-HCl buffer with KCl, MgCl2, DTT (Invitrogen), dNTPs (Invitrogen), RNasin (Promega) and Superscript RT III (Invitrogen). qPCR reactions were performed using Power Sybr Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), forward/reverse primers and cDNA obtained from the reverse transcription reaction. Relative gene expression was calculated by the ddCt method using -actin as a reference and Universal Human Reference RNA (Stratagene) as a calibrator. Among 99 male breast cancers, 82 were ER positive and 78 exhibited PR. Levels of ER (P = 0.013) and PR (P < 0.001) protein were greater in male breast cancers compared to biopsies from female patients, although no difference was observed in the expression of ESR1 and PGR genes that encode these receptors. In contrast, no differences were observed in either of the other conventional breast cancer biomarkers, HER-2/neu or EGFR protein, nor in patient age at diagnosis. However, there was a difference in the binding affinities (Kd value) of PR (P = 0.004) between the genders, which was not observed in ER between male and female breast cancer tissues. Furthermore, expression levels of six genes (NAT1, TBC1D9, IL6ST, RABEP1, PLK1 and LRBA) that we and others have suggested serve as indicators of risk of recurrence, were elevated in male breast cancer biopsies compared to those from female patients (P < 0.05). Preliminary results suggest that over-expression of the protein product of one or more of the genes identified represents a molecular target that warrants further exploration for development of a gender specific therapeutic and companion diagnostic.

This imaging system allows not only fluorescent signals to be quantified between specific excitation and emission filters, but also the spectral structure between these boundaries through the use of a liquid crystal that takes images in as little as 10nm increments.

        "Background":"['Most breast cancer deaths arise from tumour cells ability to produce distant metastases. Among breast tumour subtypes, luminal A tumours, which express the highest levels of estrogen receptor alpha, are associated with the poorest metastatic phenotype and with longest relapse-free survival. Usually active during embryogenesis, PAX2, a homeobox transcription factor, is of a particular interest in this context. It is preferentially activated in luminal A tumours in vivo and it was shown to downregulate the expression of ERBB2 (erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, HER-2/neu), a well-documented proinvasive and pro-metastastic gene, in these cells in response to estradiol in vitro. However, the ability of estradiol to regulate PAX2 activity and ERBB2 expression in non-luminal breast cancer cells, and the intracellular mechanisms involved in estradiol-induced PAX2 activity in breast cancer cells, have not been investigated. Objective', ' The objective of our work was to compare the impact of estradiol exposure on PAX2 activation in luminal and non-luminal breast cancer cells, and to determine the molecular mechanisms mediating estradiol-induced activation in breast cancer cells. Hypothesis', ' Estradiol would induce PAX2 activity in breast cancer cells of the luminal subtype only, in an estradiol receptor alpha-dependent manner. Results', ' Basal PAX2 activity was higher in cell lines from luminal compared to non-luminal subtype. Activation of PAX2 by estradiol, as assessed by measuring PAX2 phosphorylation on serine 393 residue and ERBB2 expression, was selectively achieved in breast cancer cell lines of the luminal subtype. This process was blocked by estrogen receptor alpha antagonist ICI 182780. Conclusion', ' PAX2 activation by estradiol is selectively achieved in breast cancer cells of the luminal subtype, via ER. We are currently investigating intracellular signaling pathways downstream of estrogen receptor alpha which could mediate estradiol-induced activation of PAX2 in luminal breast cancer cells.']",

        "Background":"['In spite of clinical advancements, tumors that no longer depend on ER/PR and ERBB2 signaling are clinically aggressive and have the poorest prognosis. Few effective treatment options exist for basal or trastuzumab-resistant ERBB2 breast cancers. Understanding the signaling pathways that drive these aggressive breast cancer subtypes is critical to the development of successful therapeutics. The receptor tyrosine kinase MET is overexpressed in 20-30% of breast cancers and correlates with poor patient outcome, independent of ERBB2 expression. Previously, we determined that MET is expressed in the majority of breast cancers. Most importantly, we determined that high MET expression correlated with ERneg/ERBB2neg tumors and the basal subtype. These studies indicate that MET may serve as a novel therapeutic target for those patients with the most aggressive tumors and currently, the fewest therapeutic options. We are utilizing breast cancer cell lines and xenograft mouse models to examine how MET and ERBB2 uniquely influence breast cancer progression. To investigate the effects of MET and/or ERBB2 inhibition we are utilizing lentiviral shRNA knockdown in both basal and luminal cells. We observed that both MET and ERBB2 depletion decrease cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, we have profiled the effects of MET and ERBB2 knockdown on the phosphorylation of 42 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and 44 tyrosine kinases. We observed that downstream signaling at the tyrosine kinase level is minimally affected by downregulation of MET or ERBB2; however, there is significant signaling compensation that occurs at the RTK level through the ERBB family members, EGFR and ERBB3. Currently, we are examining the interaction between MET and the ERBB family in both basal and luminal breast cancer cell lines. In addition, we are measuring the effect of MET or ERBB2 depletion on growth of breast cancer cells in 3D culture. In addition, we have evaluated MET and ERBB2 expression in human invasive breast carcinomas using coimmunostaining and quantitative analysis with the CRi Nuance multispectral imager. We observe that a significant percentage of tumors coexpress MET and ERBB2. Many tumors have significant heterogeneity of MET and ERBB2 expression and have patterns of cells that are METhigh/ERBB2low, METlow/ERBB2high, and METhigh/ERBB2high. We hypothesize that breast cancer cells expressing both MET and ERBB2 (METhigh/ERBB2high) are highly tumorigenic and have an increased proliferative capacity, metastatic potential and chemoresistance. Currently, fresh primary human breast cancer tissue is being transplanted into mammary glands of NOD-SCIDIL2R mice to determine the impact of MET and ERBB2 expression on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. These studies will reveal whether MET and ERBB2 have synergistic or exclusive roles in breast cancer progression and how these oncogenes can be targeted for successful therapy.']",

        "Background":"['Purpose', ' Hormone therapy and anti-ErbB2 (HER-2) therapy are prescribed according to the hormone status (ER/PR protein expression) and ErbB2 expression of the initial tumor. Several trials have shown the prognostic relevance of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in early and metastatic breast cancers. As it appears that the CTC, and consequently the metastatic cells, may have a very different receptor status than the related primary tumors, it is of the highest relevance to analyze ER and ErbB2 expression of the CTC. Experimental procedures', ' We developed a triple fluorescence technique to visualize simultaneously cytokeratin (8/18, 8/19), ER and ErbB2 on each individual cell. Using this protocol, we analyzed ER and ErbB2 expression in various breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, Cama-1, ZR75, SK-Br-3, HCC 3153, MDA-MB-231), and compared ER expression in the different cell lines using also immunostaining. We were then able to test the CTC presence (CK positivity) and ER and ErbB2 expressions on blood samples (cytospins) collected from 15 metastatic breast cancer patients. Results', ' The 2-step triple fluorescence protocol was optimized to visualize CK in green (DyLight488 conjugate), ER in red (cy3 conjugate) and ErbB2 in blue (AMCA conjugate). Using in parallel this triple fluorescence protocol and the reference immunostaining technique, we could analyze that ER-positive cell lines express very different levels of ER and within one cell line, cells can express low, moderate and/or high levels of ER. The identification of cells that express a very low level of ER is compulsory as the CTC from one unique patient can potentially express differently ER. Consequently, ER-positivity and -negativity have to be clearly defined. CTC analysis from patient blood samples was then performed with an individual assessment, for each single isolated cell, of cytokeratin (epithelial marker that peripheral blood cells should not express) and of ER and ErbB2 expressions. We were able to identify, among the CTC positive patients, changes between primary tumor status and CTC status, e.g. ER-positive primary tumors with both ER-positive and ER-negative CTC. Those ER-negative CTC may direct towards tamoxifen resistance and have to be identified among other ER-positive cells, similarly as any ErbB2 negative CTC. Conclusion', ' We demonstrated that triple immunofluorescence is very relevant, first to identify CTC, and then to allow an individual assessment of ER and ErbB2 expression, at the protein level. Moreover, the approach we developed allows to characterize a population of CTC with a very low expression of ER. Large multicentric cohorts of breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant therapy should now be analyzed for both ER and ErbB2 status of the CTC, compared to the primary tumor profile. The expected results should lead to optimal individualized treatments.']",

        "Background":"['Novel strategies for prevention of breast cancer are desirable mainly because many risk factors associated with this disease are not easily modifiable. In addition, currently available clinical options for prevention of breast cancer (eg, selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors) are sub-optimal. Recent literature highlights merit of plants used in Ayurvedic medicine, which has been practiced for centuries in India for treatment of different disorders, for identification of novel cancer preventive agents. Withania somnifera (also known as Ashwagandha) is one such medicinal plant that is used to alleviate a variety of symptoms. In experimental models, the known pharmacological effects of Withania somnifera include cardioprotection from ischemia reperfusion injury, inhibition of experimental Parkinsonism, suppression of hepatic lipid peroxidation, antibacterial effects, and anticancer effects. Anticarcinogenic effect of Withania somnifera is ascribed to withanolides such as withaferin A (WA). We have shown previously that WA treatment inhibits growth of cultured and xenografted human breast cancer cells by causing apoptotic cell death. The present study extends these observations and determines efficacy of WA for prevention of breast cancer in a clinically-relevant transgenic mouse model (MMTV-neu). Incidence and burden of mammary cancer and pulmonary metastasis were scored in female MMTV-neu mice after 28 weeks of intraperitoneal administration (three times/week) with 0.1 mg WA (n = 32) or vehicle (n = 29). This mild-regimen of WA administration resulted in a statistically significant decrease in macroscopic (palpable) tumor size, microscopic tumor area, and incidence of pulmonary metastasis. For example, the mean wet weight of the palpable tumor was lower by 50% in WA-treated mice compared with control mice (P = 0.03). Likewise, the area of invasive mammary cancer was lower by 95.14% in WA-treated mice compared with control mice (P = 0.05). The WA-treated mice exhibited a 72.8% decrease in incidence of pulmonary metastasis compared with the control mice (P = 0.02). Immunohistochemistry revealed reduced expression of HER-2 in tumors from WA-treated mice compared with control. Furthermore, consistent with cellular observations, mammary cancer prevention by WA treatment was associated with increased apoptosis index, inhibition of complex III activity, and increased staining for 8-oxo-dG (an indicator of oxidative stress). In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that WA inhibits mammary carcinogenesis in a transgenic mouse model by causing apoptosis.

        "Background":"['The estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, also known as ErbB-2 or c-neu) are the major biomarkers that define the classification and treatment options for patients with breast cancers. ER and PR positive breast cancers are more likely to respond to hormonal therapy. HER2 positive breast cancers are more likely to respond to trastuzumab targeted therapy. On the other end, triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) which lack ER and PR and do not overexpress HER2 do not respond well to hormonal therapy or HER2 targeted therapy and are associated with poor prognosis. Once patients with TNBC develop chemoresistance or relapse, there is no additional treatment option available. The key for developing novel therapeutics in TNBC is to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which these receptors undergo silencing, especially ER and PR. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small noncoding RNAs, have been shown to be important gene regulators in all biological processes including breast carcinogenesis and progression. Through an in silico analysis of the latest miRNAs database with four different miRNA algorithms, we have identified 11 putative miRNAs that target all 3-untranslated regions (3-UTRs) of the ER, PR and HER2 genes. miR-495 was one of the putative miRNAs that has been verified to be a significant regulator of ER and PR. Ectopic expression of miR-495 mimics in BT474 and MDA-MB-361 breast cancer cells greatly reduced ER and PR protein expression, but not HER2 expression. Enforced expression of a miR-495 inhibitor or antigomiR-495 in MDA-MB-361 breast cancer cells significantly elevated ER and PR expression. More importantly, miR-495 markedly inhibited the luciferase activities of both ER and PR reporters that contained the wild-type 3-UTRs of ER and PR. miR-495 could not, however, affect the luciferase activities of the mutant ER and PR reporters that had been deleted the seed sequences in the 3-UTRs of ER and PR, indicating that ER and PR are direct downstream targets of miR-495. miR-495 expression in primary breast cancers was assessed by in situ hybridization on a tissue microarray that containing 97 cases of randomly selected breast cancers. miR-495 levels were upregulated in thirteen breast cancers (13.4%). Among these 13 cases, 6 were TNBCs (46.2%), 2 were ER/PR low expressing breast cancers and 1 was ER/PR negative HER2 positive breast cancer. Therefore, miR-495 is a novel negative regulator of ER and PR and is upregulated in primary TNBC.

Results', ' One hundred ninety-one women with ER-positive breast cancer received platinum based NACT. Mean age was 52 years (range 31-83). One hundred eleven (58.1%) women were premenopausal and 80 (41.9%) postmenopausal. The clinical stage at presentation', ' IIA (6.3%), IIB (26.7%), IIIA (31.9%), IIIB (30.9%), IIIC (4.2%). Sixty one (31.9%) pts had her-2/neu positive tumors. pCR occurred in 17 patients (8.9%), premenopausal vs. postmenopausal (9.9% vs. 7.5%, p=0.56), white race vs. black (9.9% vs. 4.9%, p=0.32), Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic (9.4% vs. 6.8%, p=0.6), tumor size <=4 cm vs. >4 cm (14.7% vs. 7.6%, p=0.19), her-2/neu positive vs. her-2/neu negative (13.1% vs. 6.9%, p=0.16), T4 vs. T1-T3 (4.8% vs. 10.9%, p=0.19). Conclusions', ' pCR rates with platinum based NACT in pts with hormone receptor-positive tumors were low. The pCR rate did not appear to be influenced by her2/neu, tumor size, race, ethnicity or menopausal status.']",

Following surgery and initial treatment, recurrence remains a risk for all patients with breast cancer.      Methods', '    This is a cross sectional study.   Complete data of 300 patients treated for early breast cancer during 2004-2008 at Oncology Dept, LNH was analysed.  Out of these 300 patients, 76 patients had relapsed.  Data were collected on SPSS version 17, and analyzed.  Variables were age, tumor size, nodal status, tumor grade, hormonal status and her 2 neu  status, taxanes versus non taxanes treatment, use of trastuzumab and hormonal treatment.  Early relapse was defined as in less than 2 years and relapse after 2 or more years was taken as late relapse.  Results', '    300 patients were analyzed. Mean age of our patients were 47.6  11.2 years. Out of these 300, 73 patients relapsed (24.7%). 44 patients (58%) relapsed in less than 2 years, and 33 patients (42%) relapsed after 2 years.  Risk factors associated with relapse included tumor size, nodal status, grade and hormone receptor status. There was significant association between hormonal status  and time to relapse ((P 0.001). We did not find any significant association in over all relapse rate, and different immunohistochemical subtypes but on analyses of time to relapse, early relapse was higher in triple negatives and her 2 neu positive group (P 0.001). There was a trend towards increased incidence of visceral and brain metastases in early relapse and of bone metastases in late relapse.  Patients who relapsed early (< 2 years) had median survival of 1 year while those who relapsed after 2 years had median survival of 4 years.  Conclusions', '    We found strong association of  ER/PR status only with time to relapse in carcinoma breast. Early relapse was higher in triple negatives and her 2 neu positive group with shorter median survival in early relapse.']",

        "Background":"['The mainstay of HER2+ breast cancer treatment has been monoclonal antibody therapy with Trastuzumab, a humanized antibody that targets HER-2. However, the efficacy of Trastuzumab monotherapy is only 10-15%. Therefore, strategies are being developed to enhance its therapeutic efficacy. Our previous study demonstrated that stimulation of NK cells with an anti-CD137 agonistic mAb enhanced Trastuzumab-mediated Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC). Anti-CD137 agonistic mAb enhanced anti-breast cancer activity of Trastuzumab in vivo in a xenotransplanted human breast cancer model (Kohrt et al. J Clin. Invest, 2012, 22', '3). We have developed a treatment regimen consisting of sequential administration of Trastuzumab followed by CD137 antibody as three weekly injections. This regimen demonstrated more potent antitumor activity than administration of anti-CD137 mAb followed by Trastuzumab. Our combination therapy was superior to Traztuzumab alone in a primary HER2-overexpressing-breast tumor xenotransplant model but was ineffective in low HER-2 expressing breast cancer model. Next, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of FDA approved antibody drug conjugate Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) in combination with CD137 antibody. We used HER2 over-expressing HER18 xenograft model and an SU-258 primary breast cancer model in our studies. Following tumor inoculation, mice received either T-DM1 on day 3 (for HER18 xenograft), or day 30 (for SU-258) and anti-CD137 antibody on day 4(or HER18) or day 31(for SU-258) with each treatment repeated weekly for a total of three weeks. Sequential antibody strategy with T-DM1 and CD137 significantly improved survival compared to T-DM1 alone or with Trastuzumab and CD137 antibody. Our results demonstrate that T-DM1 retains its potency and demonstrates synergistic activity with anti-CD137 mAb therapy against HER2-overexpressing breast cancer models. Our results support a novel, sequential antibody approach against HER-2+breast cancer, by targeting first the tumor with an antibody drug conjugate and then the host immune system. Clinical investigations are now planned to determine the clinical outcome of our immunotherapy strategy.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Incidence of breast cancer is lower in African-American women than White women, but African-American women have worse survival and represent a greater proportion of young women. Obesity is a factor in disparities. Leptin and adiponectin, hormones produced by adipose tissue, are active in breast cancer cell lines and correlate with tumor characteristics. Leptin has mitogenic effects in vitro and increases with obesity; adiponectin has inhibitory effects and decreases with obesity. Studies suggest that adipocytokine levels differ by race, adjusted for body mass index (BMI). In a small study of adipocytokine levels by race in women with breast cancer, we found that African-American women had higher levels of adipocytokines, adjusted for BMI. There was also a correlation between tumor grade and adipocytokine levels. In this study, we examined a larger number of women to replicate these findings. We measured adipocytokine levels in African-American and White women with breast cancer and correlated tumor characteristics with adipocytokine levels. Methods', ' We performed a retrospective case-case study of 164 African-American and 172 White breast cancer patients. Adiponectin and leptin levels were measured in serum by ELISA. Records were abstracted for BMI, age, stage, grade, ER/PR, and Her-2 neu status. Adipocytokine levels were compared between races by Chi-square analysis and adjusted for BMI. Results', ' Mean leptin levels were higher in African-American women, adjusted for BMI (p<0.001). There was a trend toward triple negative tumors with higher leptin levels (p=0.06). There was a correlation between younger age and premenopausal status with lower adiponectin levels, adjusted for BMI. Women aged 60 had higher adiponectin levels than women aged 40-49, (p=0.002). Premenopausal women had lower adiponectin levels (p=0.01). Conclusions', ' Our findings suggest that leptin levels may differ by race in women with breast cancer, adjusted for BMI. Higher levels of leptin may correlate with triple negative tumors. We found that younger women have lower levels of adiponectin, which may play a role in breast cancer in young women. With further study, differences in leptin may prove to be a biologic cause of some of the observed disparities in breast cancer.']",

        "Background":"['According to a 2012 study by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), African-American women had a 41% higher rate of breast cancer mortality during 2005-2009 than did Caucasian women. Although overall cancer mortality rates have declined significantly in the U.S. since the early 1990s, the black-white mortality gap has been steadily growing. The underlying causes of this racial disparity are likely diverse, and include factors such as lower quality of care and reduced access to mammographic screening. However, more aggressive tumor biology may also contribute significantly to racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes.Recently, a low frequency single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase, W452C, which occurs predominantly in African-American women (about 10% frequency), was significantly correlated with breast cancer. This study reported that tumors from patients harboring W452C do not amplify the erbB2 (HER2) gene or overexpress the protein, suggesting that this variant may contribute to breast cancer development through a mechanism distinct from the amplification common to HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Understanding the structural and functional differences associated with W452C will allow us to identify new strategies for customized breast cancer treatments for African American women.To address the role of the W452C SNP in breast cancer we applied a cell-free in vitro reconstitution system that uses nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs) to solubilize and support functional membrane proteins. Cell-free produced wild type HER2 and W452C were tested for tyrosine phosphorylation as well as specific binding to therapeutic anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Our results showed comparable tyrosine phosphorylation levels for both wild type and W452C HER2, suggesting that the variant itself might not alone be a driver of cancer. We observed a decreased binding affinity of trastuzumab for W452C compared to wild type HER2, suggesting that W452-positive patients might not respond to trastuzumab treatment. On the other hand, we found that W452C has a higher affinity for pertuzumab. Overall, our studies suggest that the W452C variant may be differentially sensitive to clinically pertinent therapeutic agents. Further characterization of this variant will be important for the development of more effective and precise therapeutic interventions. This in turn could lead to targeted measures that help address racial disparity problems in breast cancer mortality.']",
