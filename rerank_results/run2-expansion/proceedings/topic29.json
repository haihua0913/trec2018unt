Using a sensitive sequencing assay, we compared the genomic profiles of ESCC and EAC focused on the ability to identify potential targets for therapy in the 2 diseases.   Methods', '    DNA was extracted from 40u of FFPE sections from 71 clinically advanced ESCC and 231 EAC. Next generation sequencing based comprehensive genomic profiling (NGS) was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation based libraries to a median coverage depth of > 650x for 236 cancer-related genes. The results were evaluated for all classes of genomic alterations (GA). Clinically relevant genomic alterations (CRGA) were defined as GA linked to drugs on the market or under evaluation in mechanism driven clinical trials.  Results', '  There were no significant differences in the age range for ESCC and EAC (median', ' 63 vs. 60 years). All ESCC and EAC were at an advanced stage (Stage III/IV) at the time of sequencing. GA per sample on average in 71 ESCC and 231 EAC were 7.4 and 5.6 respectively. The frequency of CRGA in ESCC (2.6/sample; 94.4% of cases) and EAC (2.7/sample; 93.1% of cases) were similar. CRGA more frequently identified in ESCC than EAC included PIK3CA (24% vs 10%), PTEN (11% vs 4%), CCND1 (42% vs 13%) and NOTCH1 (17% vs 3%). CRGA more frequently altered in EAC than ESCC included KRAS (23% vs 6%) and ERBB2 (23% vs 3%). Other GA that were significantly different in the 2 tumor types included SMAD4 (1% ESCC vs 14% EAC), SOX2 (18% ESCC vs 1% EAC) and NFE2L2 (24% ESCC vs 1% EAC). EGFR was altered in 8% of ESCC and 15% of EAC. Clinical case examples of patient responses to targeted therapy will be presented.   Conclusions', '    ESCC and EAC share common high frequencies of overall and clinically relevant GA. However, PI3K/mTOR (PIK3CA and PTEN) and Notch pathway genes were significantly enriched in ESCC, and RAS/MEK pathway genes (ERBB2 and KRAS) were significantly enriched in EAC. Comprehensive genomic profiling shows significant promise to identify CRGA in both ESCC and EAC and lead to potential use of clinical outcome altering targeted therapies in both major types of esophageal cancer.']",

        "Background":"['Esophageal cancer is one of the most common cancers, and the 5-year survival rate is less than 10% due to lack of effective therapeutic agents. This study was to evaluate antitumor activity of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE, a recently developed bispecific enediyne-energized fusion protein, on esophageal carcinoma, targeting both EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), because both EGFR and HER2 have been shown overexpression in over 30% of esophageal cancers. The fusion protein Ec-LDP-Hr-AE was encoded by a gene that was genetically constructed by fusing the oligopeptides ligand Ec (22 amino acids of EGF COOH-terminal) and Hr (VH CDR3 region of anti-HER2 C6.5 antibody) with lidamycin (LDM, an enediyne antibiotic with potent cytotoxicity) via two (G4S)3-linker. The encoded 18.4 kDa fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and characterized its binding affinity with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells by flow-cytometry-based immunofluorescence assay. The results showed that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE protein bound to ESCC cells EC9706 and KYSE150 with high affinity (the Kd values were 5.283mol/L and 3.562mol/L, respectively). The potency of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE was determined on four human ESCC cell lines with differential expression of EGFR and HER2 using MTT assay. The bispecific Ec-LDP-Hr-AE showed potent cytotoxicity to EC1, EC109, EC9706 and KYSE150 cells with IC50 values in the picomolar level. Moreover, the bispecific Ec-LDP-Hr-AE was more potent than the monospecific counterparts (Ec-LDP-AE and LDP-Hr-AE) and LDM. Cell cycle distribution assay revealed that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE caused G2-M arrest in EC9706 and KYSE150 cells, in which the G2-M phase cells reached the peak with 0.1nmol/L of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE treatment. Ec-LDP-Hr-AE also induced cancer cell apoptosis in EC9706 and KYSE150 cells and the induction of apoptosis was in a dosage-dependent manner. The apoptotic index in the EC9706 cells exposed to 0.1, 0.5, or 1 nmol/L of Ec-LDP-Hr-AE were 15.0  0.3%, 38.1  0.6%, and 50.0  0.4%, respectively. Western blotting showed that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE promoted caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities as well as PARP cleavage, indicating that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE-induced apoptosis was associated with mitochondria-caspase cascade. Moreover, Ec-LDP-Hr-AE inhibited KYSE150 cancer cell proliferation via decreasing phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2, and further exerted inhibition of the activation of their downstream signaling molecules (e.g. AKT and ERK). In summary, the bispecific energized fusion protein Ec-LDP-Hr-AE exhibited potent cytotoxicity to ESCC cells in vitro, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via targeting EGFR and HER2. These results suggest that Ec-LDP-Hr-AE could be a promising candidate for esophageal cancer targeting therapy.']",

Chi-square tests determined differences between histological subtypes. Kaplan-Meier methodology estimated survival. Results', ' A total of 966 tumors (883 EACs and 113 ESCCs) were examined. Most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (71%), BRCA2 (10%), HNF1A (9%), APC (8%), SMAD4 (6.3%), PIK3CA (4.4%), ATM (5.3%), cMET (3%), ERBB2 (2.2%), PTEN (2%), and NOTCH1 (1%). When we compared EACs with ESCCs, KRAS (6.5%), NRAS (1.4%), GNAS (1%), and BRAF (0.7%) mutations were seen only in EACs, whereas, NFE2L2 mutations (R34P and E79G), and HER-2/neu overexpression (12%) and amplification (20%), were seen only in ESCCs (p < 0.001). EACs had higher overexpression of P-glycoprotein (PGP) (51% vs. 8%, p < 0.01) compared with ESCCs. ESCCs showed higher PD-L1 expression (19% vs. 6%, p < 0.01), but there was no difference in the frequency of PD-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. ESCCs also had higher overexpression of ERCC1 (55% vs. 36%, p = 0.01), MGMT (62% vs. 49%, p = 0.01), EGFR (93% vs. 75%, p = 0.003), TLE3 (70% vs. 34%, p < 0.001), RRM1 (52% vs. 36%, p = 0.006), PTEN (67% vs. 50%, p = 0.001), and TOPO1 (76% vs. 61%, p = 0.002) compared with EACs. In a small subset of pts, survival data were available, and low PGP expression was associated with prolonged survival (HR = 8.7, p = 0.004).Conclusions', ' Molecular profile differences between EACs and ESCCs indicate different carcinogenic pathways, and biology, that may influence response to therapy. Low frequency mutations in several druggable genes may provide therapeutic opportunities. Correlation of low PGP with prolonged survival implicates PGP as a prognostic biomarker, and highlights the importance of targeting multi-drug resistance.']",

        "Background":"[\"The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is rising rapidly throughout the Western world, and is associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus (BE). BE is intestinal metaplasia of squamous esophageal epithelium, important clinically due to the fact that it increases an individual's chance of progression to EAC 30 to 125-fold higher than people without BE. Despite its clinical importance, the molecular pathogenesis of BE is poorly understood. One limitation in the study of BE pathogenesis has been the lack of suitable experimental models. There is a critical need to develop good preclinical models of BE. ErbB2 was reported to be amplified and overexpressed in BE, EAC, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, the role of erbB2 in the development and progression of esophageal cancer is still unknown. In this study, we utilized BK5.erbB2 mice, in which erbB2 is overexpressed in epithelial cells under the control of the bovine keratin 5 promoter to determine whether the interaction between erbB2 and bile acids is important in the etiology of esophageal cancers. BK5.erbB2 mice (2 months of age, n=8) and age matched wild type mice (n=10) were treated with porcine bile extract (10mg/mouse in 200L water), taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC) (0.1mol/mouse in 200L water), or water control, 3 times weekly for 14 weeks by gavage. In the BK5.erbB2 mice, exophytic tumors in the forestomach, which has the same histological structure of esophagus, were observed in 20%, 33%, and 0% of mice treated with bile extract, TCDC, and water control, respectively. No tumors were observed in wild type mice. All tumors observed in BK5.erbB2 mice were diagnosed as SCC. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that the bile acid treatment increased the levels of p-EGFR, p-MAPK, and p-Akt in the forestomachs of the BK5.erbB2 mice. Furthermore, CDX2 (a marker of BE) was significantly expressed in BK5.erbB2 mice treated with bile extract or TCDC. No development of intestinal metaplasia in forestomach was found. We further investigated using a surgically manipulated reflux model. Eleven 7 week-old BK5.erbB2 and 5 wild type mice were given an esophagogastroduodenostomy. Mice were sacrificed at post-operative week 8, and examined histologically. Hyperkeratosis and intestinal metaplasia were observed at the anastomosis sites in both BK5.erbB2 and wild type mice. These histological changes were more prominent in BK5.erbB2 mice. Interestingly, dysplastic lesions were observed only in BK5.erbB2 mice. These results indicate that more persistent exposure of bile via surgery induce the development of not only SCC, but also precancerous lesions of adenocarcinoma in the esophagus/forestomach of BK5.erbB2 mice. The interaction between erbB2 and bile acids is important in esophageal tumor formation and intestinal metaplasia. A surgical model using BK5.erbB2 mice could possibly be a promising model for the study of the development of EAC.\"]",

        "Background":"['The 5-year survival rate of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains dismal despite improvements in treatments such as surgical resection and adjuvant chemoradiation, and current clinical staging approaches are limited in their ability to effectively stratify patients for treatment options. To improve the clinical risk assessment for ESCC patients, we developed an immunohistochemistry-based predictor model by evaluating the prognostic value of a three-gene signature, i.e. epidermal growth factor receptor, phosphorylated Specificity protein 1, and Fascin, which constitute a regulatory axis in ESCC cells as revealed by our previously study. The presence of this three-gene signature and the association with clinical outcomes were analyzed in 185 esophageal curative resection specimens (generation dataset), and the findings were validated using an independent cohort of 130 specimens (validation dataset). We revealed that the protein expression of this three-gene signature was highly predictive of ESCC survival in both generation and validation datasets (P=0.001). Regression analysis showed that this three-gene signature was an independently predictor of overall survival (hazard ratio=1.990 [95% CI, 1.256-3.154], P=0.003 in generation dataset; hazard ratio=2.358 [95% CI, 1.391-3.996], P=0.001 in validation dataset). Importantly, the predictive ability of the 3-gene signature was more robust than that of each individual factor. In conclusion, this immunohistochemistry-based molecular model accurately predicts ESCC patient survival, and thus could serve as a complement to current approached in clinical risk stratification.Note', ' This abstract was not presented at the meeting.']",

Squamous cell carcinoma is the predominant histologic subtype of esophageal cancer, particularly in Asia. Currently, no targeted therapy has been approved for treating this type of disease. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy remains to be the standard care for first line treatment of advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer with limited efficacy. Activation of EGFR/HER3/PI3K pathway is frequently observed in esophageal cancer, however, their therapeutic value remains to be further tested.Methods', ' In this study, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of LJM716, a fully human anti-HER3 antibody, either alone or in combination with anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab or PI3K alpha subunit inhibitor BYL719 in esophageal squamous cancer. LJM716, cetuximab and BYL719 single agent as well as their pair-wised combination activity were assessed in 24 esophageal squamous cancer cell (ESCC) lines using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay. Single agent and combination anti-tumor activities of these reagents were also tested in selected cell line xenograft and patient derived xenograft mouse models.Results', ' NRG1 expression (60%), PIK3CA mutation (8%), moderate PIK3CA (30%) and EGFR (30%) amplification were detected in a panel of 24 ESCC lines. Anti-HER3 antibody LJM716 potently inhibited HER3 phosphorylation and decreased pAKT level in these cell lines. In vitro, LJM716 inhibited proliferation of a sub-set of ESCC lines. LJM716 further enhanced and broadened the anti-tumor activities of both BYL719 and cetuximab in ESCC lines. In mouse xenograft models, LJM716 single agent treatment induced tumor stasis while combination with either BYL719 or cetuximab induced model dependent tumor regression.Conclusion', ' NRG1-HER3-PI3K pathway activation is commonly observed in esophageal squamous cell cancer. Activation of HER3 is a potential mechanism leading to resistance to EGFR or PI3K targeted therapies, and combining anti-HER3 therapies with therapies targeting PI3K/EGFR may provide new therapeutic strategy for patients with esophageal squamous cell cancer.']",

While the etiological causes remain unclear, esophageal mucosal fungal infection is very common in esophageal cancer patients, including patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) who have more than 20-fold risk of ESCC when compared to the healthy population. Here, we report that kinase-dead Ikka knock-in mice (hereafter referred to as mutant mice) develop APECED-like autoimmune disease due to developmental defects in thymus and lack of central tolerance. Similar to human APECED patients who develop esophageal mucosal fungal infection on average at the age of five, mutant mice develop fungal infection in oral cavity and esophagus as early as seven weeks old. About 20% of mutant mice develop ESCC during aging, which exhibits specific molecular signatures observed in human ESCC, such as p16 gene silencing, elevated EGFR phosphorylation and PD-L1 expression, etc. Autoreactive T cell depletion, or central tolerance reconstitution and/or normal T cell transfer prevents fungal infection and ESCC development in mutant mice. Importantly, antifungal drug treatment inhibits inflammation and ESCC development in mutant mice. However, oral inoculation of Clasdosporium, one of the major fungal species isolated from mutant mice, increases the tumor incidence from 20% to 63% in mutant mice.

        "Background":"['Background', ' As described in the MyPathway study, amplification and other mutations in ErbB-family proteins are actionable events across solid tumors. Targeting ERBB2 amplifications (amp) in tubular GI cancers (TGC) improves patient outcomes. ErbB family comparisons across anatomic sites is lacking and here we describe the largest known series in TGC. Methods', ' DNA was extracted from 12,685 FFPE clinical TGC specimens, including 1,720 esophageal CA*. CGP was performed on hybrid-capture, adaptor ligation based libraries to a mean coverage depth of 720X for up to 315 genes plus 47 introns from 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer. Results', ' Across all TGC cases, amp was the most frequent genomic alteration among ErbB members at 8.7%. ERBB2 amp was 2.3x as common as EGFR amp across TGC. Across TGC sites, EGFR amp was most frequent in esophageal SCC (13.7%) and ERBB2 amp was most common in gastroesophageal junction adenoCA (21%) compared with overall frequencies of 2.7% and 5.5% respectively. ERBB3 and ERBB4 amp were rare, and most common in gastroesophageal adenoCA relative to other TGC. Clinical support with outcomes for patients treated with anti-ErbB targeted therapy across TGC will be presented, including profiling from cases of acquired resistance to anti-ErbB targeted therapy. Conclusions', ' Among TGC, esophageal CA harbored the most ErbB family member amp with variation by histology. Profiling across ErbB proteins in TGC suggests biologic differences and may affect response to treatment. CGP can expand the population who may benefit from anti-ErbB directed therapies and refine treatment choices. Further research is warranted.

        "Background":"['BackgroundEsophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) represents the most common form of esophageal cancer worldwide, especially in East Asia, where alcohol drinking and smoking have been implicated in the field carcinogenesis of ESCC. However, the oncogenic process therein has been poorly understood in terms of gene mutations.Patients & MethodsA total of 100 samples, including cancer, dysplastic, and non-dysplastic esophageal tissues, were obtained from 24 individual with (N = 14) or without (N = 10) ESCC (a median of 2.5 samples per case', ' 129) either by endoscopy or surgery and were subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES). An additional paired cancer/non-caner samples from 32 patients was analyzed by targeted sequencing (TS). All samples were analyzed for copy number alterations (CNAs) using SNP array- and/or digital sequencing-based karyotyping.ResultsIn WES, clonal evolution in esophageal epithelia, as determined by the presence of somatic mutations, was detected in 21 of 21 cancer, 12 of 12 dysplastic, and 63 of 67 non-dysplastic samples, where the mean number of mutation per sample showed a significant trend to increase in cancer (65) and dysplastic samples (50) compared to non-dysplastic samples (13) (P = 2.110-11). CNAs, especially those involving CDKN2A, CCND1, YAP1, and EGFR, were frequently affected in cancer samples, but rarely so in non-dysplastic samples. Non-dysplastic samples tended to have smaller allelic burden and therefore, clone size, compared to dysplastic and cancer samples (P = 2.210-16). Mutations had a predominant age-related signature in non-dysplastic samples but increasing APOBEC3A/3B patterns was observed in cancer and dysplastic samples. Shared mutations were found only within cancer tissues but never among dysplastic or non-dysplastic samples, suggesting the latter lesions are clonally independent from each other. In accordance with previous reports, TP53 mutations were found in 21/21 cancer samples and also found in dysplastic (11/12) and non-dysplastic samples at a lower frequency (26/67). Strikingly, non-dysplastic samples harbored a very high frequency of NOTCH1 mutations (51/67), which were also found in cancer (3/21) and non-dysplastic (8/12) samples but at much lower frequencies (P = 6.610-7). TS of validation samples confirmed the trend of higher NOTCH1 (84% vs. 25%) and lower TP53 mutation rates (38% vs. 100%) in non-dysplastic samples compared to cancer samples. The number of mutations in non-dysplastic samples was higher in drinkers than non-drinkers. Multiple NOTCH1 mutations were more common in cancer patients and drinkers than non-drinkers.ConclusionClonal proliferation in non-cancer esophageal epithelia is common even in non-ESCC cases and extensive in ESCC cases. NOTCH1 and TP53 mutations play major roles in clonal evolution in common but may have differential impacts on esophageal carcinogenesis, which is likely to be shaped by APOBEC-induced mutations and CNAs.']",

        "Background":"['The majority of breast cancer deaths are due to the development of metastatic disease. The metastatic cascade consists of a series of steps and includes primary tumor growth and angiogenesis, invasion, intravasation, cell survival in circulation, extravasation and sustained growth at secondary organ sites to form micrometastases. Previous studies have shown that overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; ErbB1; Her1) increases tumor cell motility, intravasation and motility. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the metastatic potential of cancer cells depends not only on their intrinsic characteristics but also on their cooperative interaction with the tumor microenvironment. For instance, imposed gradients of EGF or colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) can stimulate invasion via an EGF/CSF-1 paracrine loop between tumor cells and macrophages. Because breast malignancies exhibiting increased expression of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of receptors and their cognate ligands are associated with more biologically aggressive disease and poorer patient prognosis, we decided to study how expression of certain members of the EGF family of ligands in the context of ErbB1 overexpression can affect the processes of invasion, intravasation and metastasis using in vitro and in vivo systems. Based on initial Oncomine cancer gene expression analysis, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) overexpression was correlated with more rapid recurrence of disease in breast cancer and thus, we decided to focus our study this ligand. Briefly, MTLn3 rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells and human MDA-MB 231 breast adenocarcimona cells were transduced to overexpress HB-EGF. HB-EGF expression did not significantly affect in vitro or in vivo growth rate. In vitro microchemotaxis and invasion assays to study chemotaxis and invasion, respectively, in the presence and absence of EGF, demonstrated that random motility and spontaneous invasion were both enhanced in the presence of HB-EGF expression. Interestingly, EGF-induced chemotaxis and EGF-induced in vivo invasion were both suppressed. In vivo studies show that tumor cells expressing HB-EGF not only display increased metastasis to the lungs and extravasation from circulation, but also significantly enhanced macrophage recruitment and exerted an angiogenic effect. These findings suggest that a better understanding of the role of HB-EGF in breast cancer will aid in directing and modifying therapeutic approaches aimed at inactivating the ErbB ligand/EGFR system as well as developing approaches based on the EGF family of ligands as a target for the clinical treatment of breast cancer, ultimately leading to improved patient survival.']",

EGFR, HER2, MET, and PI3K amplifications were tested using fluorescent in situ hybridization in patients who underwent esophagectomy for distal esophagus and EGJ adenocarcinoma from 2009 to 2013. Disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients with TP53, KRAS, PI3K, BRAF, APC mutant and wild-type tumors using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression models. The impact of HER2 expression and outcomes were also analyzed.RESULTS', 'Of 54 distal esophagus and EGJ adenocarcinoma patients, 5 different driver mutations were observed in 39 patients, including TP53 (11/39, 28.2%), KRAS (6/39,15.4%), PI3K (2/11,5.1%), BRAF(1/39, 2.6%) and APC (2/39,5.1%).

        "Background":"['Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (BSCC) is a rare epithelial malignancy variant of the typical SCC, and it has been associated to an aggressive behavior, with a high capacity for developing metastasis and low survival rates. It has been reported that less than 12% of the primary esophageal carcinoma have been diagnosed as BSCC. The study aimed to compare the protein expression of HER-2, EGFR, Ki-67, Cyclins A, B1 and D1 between usual SCC and BSCC. Immunohistochemistry of 94 usual ESCC and 17 EBSCC cases were carried out using Tissue Microarray technique. Immunohistochemical analysis of cyclins and growth factors receptors was based on frequency and intensity of tumor cells in each sample; Ki-67 analysis was based on the frequency of tumor cells showing strong nuclear positive staining. When the clinicopathological data were compared, only histological grade (p=0.000) showed a significant difference between the usual and basaloid SCC groups. No significant difference was found in gender, age, lymphatic, venous, and perineural invasion, pT, pN, pM and TNM staging when the two groups were compared. No significant difference was found between the overall survival rates of both groups. In EBSCC cases, cyclin A expression was positive in 94.1% of the cases, while 5.9% showed no expression. Cyclin B1 expression showed positivity in 23.6% of cases and 76.4% showed no staining. Most of the cases (70.6%) showed no cyclin D1 expression, while 29.4% were considered positive. EGFR expression was positive in 52.9% and negative in 47.1% of the cases. Expression of HER2 was observed in a small proportion of the cases (29.4%), when compared to those (70.6%) with no expression. Considering the KI-67 labeling index, most of the cases (76.4%) were classified as Low Proliferation, while only 11.8% were considered as High Proliferation. Among the ESCC cases, 30.0% were considered negative for cyclin A expression and 70.0% cases were positive. For cyclin B1, 18.4% were positive and 81.6% showed no expression. Cyclin D1 showed no staining in 85.4% of the cases, while 14.6% were positive. EGFR expression was positive in 80.9% and negative in 19.1% of the cases. HER2 expression was negative in 52.8% and 44.7% were considered positive. Analysis of Ki-67 expression showed that most of the cases (70.8%) were classified as Low Proliferation, while 29.2% were considered as High Proliferation. Comparing the markers expression between the two groups, EGFR (p=0.025) and cyclin A (p=0.029) showed significant differences. Positive EGFR expression was more frequent in the usual ESCC than in the EBSCC group. For cyclin A, positivity was more frequent in the EBSCC group, when compared to the usual ESCC cases. Regarding the other markers, there was no significant difference between the two groups. Although some observed differences did not achieve statistical significance, this work has further highlighted possible differences between the molecular pathogenesis of BSCC and SCC.']",

        "Background":"['Dysregulated activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB) family (EGFR, ErBB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4) is involved in promoting the cellular growth of human melanoma. EGFR, ErbB3, and ErbB4 are promising targets of malignant melanoma for new molecular drug development. However, the biology of ErbB family signaling pathways indicates that functional redundancy and heterodimerization among ErbB family members can greatly compromise the therapeutic efficacy of single ErbB targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In fact, Phase II clinical trials have already shown that EGFR (ErbB1) targeting TKIs provide limited benefits to melanoma patients. Here, this study has compared single vs. multiple ErbB targeting TKIs for inhibiting the growth of melanoma cells with different ErbB family protein expression profiles. We examined the expression of ErbB family members in 14 different human melanoma cell lines (MEL-526, M14, UPCI-MEL 527.1 and 11 SK-MEL cells). EGFR was expressed in 5 of the cell lines examined (35.7 %). ErbB2 was present in 13 lines (92.9 %); ErbB3 was found in 12 lines (85.7 %); and ErbB4 was found in all the cell lines. Furthermore, individual cell lines had a particular dominant form of ErbB protein. This differential expression pattern of ErbB family proteins was also seen in melanoma tissues from patients. Out of 14 melanoma cases examined by immunohistochemistry, 8 samples (61.5 %) were positive for ErbB1 and ErbB4 expression while ErbB2 was detected in 11 samples (84.6 %). We also found that Neuregulin 3 (which ranged from 500 to 76500 pg/ml) and Neuregulin 4 (which ranged from 26-300 pg/ml), which activate ErbB3 and/or ErbB4, are the major ErbB ligands released by the human melanoma cell lines. TGF and Amphiregulin, which mainly bind to EGFR, were released in relatively lower levels by the majority of the cell lines, but high levels of these ligands were distinctly found in individual cell lines. Among all the cell lines examined, HB-EGF was barely undetectable. In addition, different sensitivities towards single ErbB targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and pan-ErbB targeting TKIs were seen among the melanoma cells. For example, the TKI sensitivities of MEL526 which expressed no EGFR but high ErbB2, 3, and 4 proteins, was found to be', ' lapatinib (IC50', ' 6.7 M) > canertinib (IC50', ' 12.4 M) = erlotinib (IC50', ' 12.9 M) > gefitinib (IC50', ' 23 M). Similarly, M14 and UPCI-MEL527.1, which also have no EGFR expression but express ErbB 2, 3, 4, also responded better to lapatinib and canertinib respectively than to gefitinib or erlotinib. Our study is the first to suggest that the pan-ErbB targeting approach may be more effective in treatment malignant melanoma. Our findings also suggest that future screening of melanoma patients for their dominantly expressed ErbB protein types can potentially serve as a guide for the choice of effective ErbB TKI in treating malignant melanoma.']",

In contrast to adenocarcinomas of the lung, SCCs do not significantly harbor epidermal growth factor (EGFR) mutations or ALK, ROS1 or RET translocations, which are therapeutically tractable. SCC of the lung and SCC of the head and neck region and esophagus not only share risk factors, morphologic features and mechanisms of tumorigenesis but also frequent fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene alterations. In addition, we found that FGFR2 and FGFR3 expression were also altered in patient derived models of SCC of various origins. FGFRs may thus represent viable therapeutic targets for the treatment of SCC.BAY 1163877, an orally available and potent inhibitor of FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3, inhibited SCC cell proliferation as well as downstream FGFR signaling in vitro. When applied in vivo, BAY 1163877 was able to reduce growth of a FGFR1-overexpressing lung SCC xenograft model, a FGFR1-overexpressing esophageal SCC xenograft model, and a FGFR3-overexpressing head and neck SCC xenograft model, achieving reductions in tumor growth by 67 to 92% as compared to the vehicle control.

When grown in three-dimensional organotypic reconstruct cultures, cells lacking E-cadherin and TGFRII demonstrate fibroblast-dependent invasion into the underlying matrix. Therefore, we hypothesized that coordinated loss of CDH1 (E-cadherin) and TGFBR2 (TGFRII) will induce tumorigenesis in vivo. We developed a mouse model targeting CDH1 and TGFBR2 loss in the oral-esophageal epithelium using the Epstein-Barr virus L2 promoter, ED-L2. For spatio-temporal control of CDH1- and TGFBR2 gene expression, we also generated an inducible mouse model using Cre-ERT(tam) under the control of the keratin 14 promoter. Few mouse models focusing on genetic alterations of oral and head-and-neck cancer exist. We show that the loss of E-cadherin and TGF receptor II without carcinogen treatment is sufficient to induce invasive HNSCC and forestomach tumors. Double knock-out animals succumb to the disease between 1 and 1.5 years of age and show invasive tumors in the oral cavity and tongue, as well as the forestomach. Advanced tumors metastasize to the lung. The tumors are characterized by Ki67-positive and p63-positive staining and show disruption of adherens junctions with loss of -catenin and mislocalisation of p120 to the cytoplasm. Additional genetic modifications frequently described for HNSCC are the upregulation of c-myc and cyclin D1. We could show that the oral mouse tumors are positive for these markers allowing us to conclude that this animal model recapitulates HNSCC at the pathologic and molecular levels. Furthermore, the forestomach is an extension of the squamous epithelium of the esophagus in the mouse. Known genetic alterations causing esophageal squamous cancer are amplification of EGFR, cyclin D1 and mutations in p53 in addition to the loss of E-cadherin and TGFRII. The analysis of the forestomach tumors recapitulates these events in the mouse model as a result of CDH1 and TGFBR2 loss.

Aberrant activation of HER3 as a result of HER2 amplification or neuregulin 1 (NRG1) over-expression has been demonstrated to mediate constitutive activation of downstream oncogenic signals. LJM716 is a fully human IgG1 anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody. It locks HER3 in an inactive conformation and prevents HER3 dimerization with other ErbB family members. This unique mode of action enables LJM716 to block both ligand dependent and ligand independent HER3 activation. In search of new indications that may benefit from anti-HER3 therapies, we noted that squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) tend to have relatively higher NRG1 expression as compared to their adenocarcinoma counterparts. Highest NRG1 expression was observed in the lung SCC cell lines in cell line encyclopedia (CLE). A subset of the lung SCC cell lines with high NRG1 expression are moderately sensitive to LJM716, with HER3 activation detected in all of the sensitive lines. Additionally, EGFR activation is consistently observed in our panel of squamous lung carcinoma models. In some cases, activation of HER2 and/or HER3 is also noted. We hypothesize that squamous lung carcinomas may be dependent on signaling through EGFR, HER2 and HER3. To completely block EGFR, HER2-HER3 signaling, we set to test the treatment of LJM716 and Cetixumab in a number of NGR 1 positive squamous lung carcinomas tumor models. Enhanced anti tumor activity of LJM716 and Cetixumab is observed in four out nine tumor models. Analysis of broad activation status of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) reveals that a subset of responsive models have activated pEGFR, pHER2 and pHER3.

        "Background":"['The Mena protein has been shown to be critical for breast cancer metastasis, and, in pre-clinical models two of its isoforms MenaINV and Mena11a are expressed in invasive and non-invasive tumor cell subpopulations, respectively. We have previously developed a quantitative immunofluorescence approach to assess the fraction of Mena protein lacking Mena11a called Menacalc as a method to infer presence of invasive tumor cells. Menacalc is determined by subtracting the population-based Z-score (quantifies the relationship to the mean) for Mena11a quantitative expression score from the population-based Z-score for total Mena quantitative expression score. The resulting Menacalc scores range from -4 to +4 with high scores reflecting tumors with relatively high total Mena (all isoforms) but low Mena11a. We showed that high MENAcalc scores associated significantly with poor disease-specific survival in breast cancer patients, including node-negative and positive cases. A recent study reported that a semi-quantitative approached to Mena assessment shows prognostic value in early Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (Bria et. al 2014). Here, we asked whether the quantitative Menacalc assay has prognostic value in NSCLC and if it can predict metastatic disease. We determined Menacalc on a cohort of 201 predominantly early-stage NSCLC cases using multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (MQIF) and then assessed Menacalc with respect to clinical and pathological features, as well as disease-specific survival. There was no significant difference in Menacalc by stage, sex, or age. However, Menacalc was significantly higher (P = 0.001) in squamous cell carcinoma (N = 32) as compared to other histological subtypes. High levels of Menacalc were associated (10% significance level) with decrease 5-year disease specific survival in all patients [HR = 1.78 (95%CI', ' 0.92-3.43); P = 0.08], and were significantly associated with survival when either corrected for histological subtype [HR = 2.10 (95%CI', ' 1.04-4.26); P = 0.04] or in the squamous-only population [HR = 6.60 (95%CI', ' 1.22-53.75); P = 0.04]. There was no difference in survival as a function of stage nor in adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, consistent with Mena isoform status being associated with the metastatic phenotype, Menacalc was 2-fold higher (P = 0.09) in metastatic patients, but the sample size with available clinical data was limited (N = 9). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Menacalc has potential prognostic value especially in squamous cell carcinoma patients. These data also preliminarily suggest that Menacalc can predict the metastatic phenotype. Further studies examining Mena isoform expression in squamous and later-stage metastatic NSCLC patients is thus warranted and currently ongoing.']",

        "Background":"['Growth factor receptors of the ErbB family, especially ErbB1 (EGFR) and ErbB2 (HER2), have attracted considerable attention in recent years as therapeutic targets for the treatment of numerous malignancies including cancers of the lung, colon, and breast, either through blockade of the extracellular ligand binding site by monoclonal antibodies (e.g. anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, and anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab) or inhibition of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain by small molecule inhibitors (e.g. EGFR kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib, and dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor lapatinib). The abundance of small molecule kinase inhibitors in clinical development or on the market attests to the acceptance of ErbB inhibition as a clinically relevant paradigm. Nevertheless, the emergence of resistance mechanisms in ErbB driven or dependent tumors indicates that continued research is required to discover more effective drugs. We previously reported the discovery of JNJ-28871063, a potent inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 kinases in vitro that also showed excellent antitumor efficacy in EGFR (A431 epidermoid carcinoma) and HER2 (N87 gastric carcinoma) overexpressing xenograft models and significant extension of survival in a mouse intracranial tumor model. This compound is a 4-amino-6-arylaminopyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde oxime, a monocyclic chemotype that mimics the traditional bicyclic quinazoline scaffold via an intramolecular hydrogen-bonded pseudocycle involving the adjacent 4-amino and 5-oximino groups. In this study, we present results of a structure-guided analog program designed to optimize in vitro kinase potency and in vivo antitumor efficacy of the pyrimidine-oximes. While substituents on the 6-arylamino group are critical for ErbB inhibitory potency and kinase selectivity, substitution on the oxime oxygen may be changed to modify physico-chemical properties and bioavailability.

        "Background":"['Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the most common used assay for detecting/quantifying defined protein biomarkers in specific tissue location in clinical/preclinical settings as prognostic/drug-predictive biomarker assays. However, IHC suffers from several key drawbacks, limiting its applications, including semi-quantitative nature, inconsistence, low sensitivity, narrow dynamic detection range and inadequacy for multi-target analysis, etc. An alternative method is immunofluorescence (IF), but with even lower usage for its disadvantageous photo-instability. A sensitive, quantitative and robust assay is thus an urgent/unmet need. We have recently developed a novel fluorescence nanoparticle (PID, phosphor integrated dye) with highly compact phosphor inside. PID has several key advanced features', ' 1) enhanced fluorescence (30,000x brighter over the conventional fluorescence and significantly above tissue auto-fluorescence), 2) enhanced photo-stability (stained slide is stable for >2 years); 3) highly quantitative by broadened detection dynamic range through enumeration of the bright fluorescent dots (nanoparticles) instead of signal amplification as in IHC (digital vs. analog); 4) fine subcellular imaging; 5) potentials for multi-color and H&E/bright light imaging. PDX is a well-accepted experimental cancer model mimicking original patients in histo- & molecular pathology(1), as well as drug response. We previously conducted a series of mouse clinical trial (MCT) of Erbitux on PDX cohorts of NSCLC, CRC, gastric and esophageal cancers (2,3), showing specific subsets of high-EGRF-expressing PDXs responded to the drug, where EGFR expression was measured by either RNAseq (mRNA) or IHC (protein). To assess PID-EGFR as a new biomarker assay platform, we analysed and compared its quantification to RNAseq and IHC, particularly in terms of the correlation to the drug efficacy. Our data demonstrates a greatly enhanced correlation of PID scores to mRNA levels in all cancer types, and to the tumor growth inhibition of gastric (3) and esophageal (4) carcinoma, but not in CRC (2) and NSCLC (Li et al., unpublished) as anticipated. The results demonstrated that PID-EGFR is a significantly improved histopathology based EGFR protein quantification assay over IHC-EGFR assay, warranting further clinical confirmation.']",

Various molecular and cellular abnormalities are found in NSCLC, and an established theme is the alteration of protein phosphotyrosine (pY), as exemplified by elevated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity recognized in a subset of NSCLC. In order to gain a broad perspective of pY-mediated signaling networks in NSCLC, mass spectrometry was used to analyze pY-containing peptides affinity purified from protease-digested xenograft tumors. Seventeen tumors representing the major NSCLC subtypes adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were characterized. The major classes of pY proteins detected were cytoskeletal, protein kinases, and adhesion proteins. Pathways and cellular functions enriched in the data set included focal adhesion, adherens junction, and ErbB signaling. Five receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) were detected, with EGFR and EPHA2 most prevalent. Src-family kinases (YES, LYN, FRK and LCK) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) comprised the majority of non-receptor tyrosine kinases measured. Analysis of individual pY sites on 14 tyrosine kinases indicates their activation by kinase domain activation loop phosphorylation, but also revealed additional pY sites suggestive of regulation by trafficking/endocytosis and inter- and intra-molecular protein-protein interactions involving, for example, SH2 and SH3 domains, and extra-kinase domain regions. Analysis of tumors based on protein-pY suggested subtypes distinguished by their activated tyrosine kinase networks. Genetic analysis of 3 tumors that displayed EGFR-associated phospho-proteome signatures confirmed that they carried either EGFR activating mutations (in two ADCs) or increased gene copy number (in one SCC). Western blot analysis of protein pY confirmed different patterns of cellular protein pY among the tumor phospho-types in agreement with the phospho-proteomic analysis. Quantification of kinase and substrate pY sites, according to their integrated extracted ion currents, revealed a set of phosphorylations that constituted a molecular signature that differentiated between the ADC and SCC subtypes. In summary, quantitative phospho-proteomic profiling of NSCLC tumors is feasible and may have utility in the categorization of individual tumors according to their networks of activated tyrosine kinases and substrates.']",

The prognosis for HNSCC is relatively poor, with an overall 5-year survival around 60%, and the outlook worsens with increasing stage at diagnosis, which is problematic since about two-thirds of patients present with advanced stage disease. This underscores the urgent need for discovery, development and translation of novel biomarkers to facilitate early detection of HNSCC and bolster the chance for positive patient outcomes. Exosomes are nano-sized (40-150 nm) membrane-encapsulated vesicles that may offer a new avenue for discovery and development of novel HNSCC biomarkers. However, they are released by essentially all cells, both normal and malignant, into the extracellular space, resulting in a noisy environment in biofluids from the perspective of biomarker measurement. As such, a membrane-bound surface marker that allows for enrichment for cancer-derived exosomes in patient samples would provide a clear benefit. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which belongs to the ErbB/HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases, localizes to the plasma membrane and is over-expressed in as much as 90% of HNSCC tumors. Therefore, we hypothesized that EGFR will be over-represented on membranes of HNSCC-derived exosomes and thus may offer utility as a surface marker for detection and/or enrichment. To test this, we cultured an HNSCC cell line that over-expresses EGFR (FaDu), EGFR-deficient SW620 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, and primary human oral epithelial cells pooled from 3 healthy donors. Cells were cultivated in supplier-recommended media with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) that was super-depleted of exosomes via 18 hour ultracentrifugation at 100,000g and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2 in 150 cm2 flasks with 25mL media. After reaching 80-90% confluence, media was harvested, and exosomes were isolated and purified via differential ultracentrifugation. Exosome isolates were whole-mounted on carbon grids, Immuno-Gold labeled with anti-EGFR, and imaged on a JEOL JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope (Immuno-EM); anti-nucleoporin 153 (NUP-153), which localizes to the nucleus, was used as a negative control. Immuno-EM images indicate abundant EGFR expression on exosomes secreted by FaDu HNSCC cells, but EGFR is not detectable on the exosomes secreted by the oral epithelial cells from healthy donors. These results indicate that EGFR may offer utility for enrichment for HNSCC-derived exosomes in human biofluid isolates using magnetic beads or flow cytometry.']",

Previous studies have observed a significant relationship between EGFR overexpression and poor outcomes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) including OSCC. Elevated EGFR levels have primarily been attributed to enhanced transcriptional activity, rather than amplification of the gene. Since the EGFR intron 1 polymorphic CA dinucleotide repeats has been suggested to affect EGFR transcription efficiency, the present study was designed to explore the relationship between this CA repeats polymorphism, gene copy number and protein levels in Taiwanese OSCC. A total of 194 OSCCs were examined for EGFR protein overexpression using immunohistochemistry and for copy number using a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay. DNAs from peripheral blood of 164 OSCC patients were also available for EGFR intron 1 CA dinucleotide repeats analysis. Overexpression and increased gene copy numbers of EGFR were found in 101 (52.06%) and 59 (30.41%) cases, respectively. The length of EGFR CA repeats were not associated with EGFR protein expression (p = 0.261) while the copy number was strongly related to protein overexpression (p < 0.001). EGFR protein overexpression was associated with young age (p = 0.036), tumor differentiation (p < 0.001) and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.028). EGFR gene copy number was also associated with young age (p = 0.009), tumor cell differentiation (p = 0.002), tumor depth (p = 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.051) and bone invasion (p = 0.003). However, the length of EGFR CA repeats was not associated with clinicopathologic factors. Patients with EGFR overexpression in their tumors were found to have significant poorer disease-free survival (DFS) (p = 0.026, log-rank test) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.019, log-rank test) than those without overexpression. Patients with CA repeats SS form (both alleles < 19 repeats) had significantly shorter DFS and OS than those with SL and LL forms (both alleles  19 repeats) (p = 0.039 and 0.018 for DFS and OS, respectively). On the other hand, the association between an increase in EGFR gene copies and DFS or OS was insignificant.

        "Background":"['The high molecular weight, transmembrane mucin, MUC1 is expressed at high levels in many epithelial tumors including endometrial and pancreatic cancers. Aberrant glcosylation and overexpression of MUC1 make tumor cells poorly adherent, protect tumor cells from the host immune system, promote metastases from primary sites and enhance resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. MUC1 has three distinct domains', ' an extracellular domain (ECD) composed of a tandem repeat region rich in serine, threonine and proline; a transmembrane domain (TM) and; a short cytoplasmic tail domain (CT) involved in a variety of signal transduction events. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR/erbB) family members regulate cell growth and survival in both normal and cancer cells. MUC1 interacts with erbB receptors and also affects downstream signaling pathways in a EGFR-ligand dependent manner. We previously demonstrated that the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor  (PPAR) agonist rosiglitazone severely inhibits progesterone stimulated MUC1 expression (Wang et al. 2010. Mol. Endocrinol. 24', ' 1368-1379). Two independent approaches were used to determine if rosiglitazone as well as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG1478 reduced MUC1 expression in a high MUC1-expressing cell line, HES; the uterine adenocarcinoma cell line, HEC-1A; and in the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, HPAFII and CAPAN2. EGFR activation by Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) stimulated MUC1 protein expression (1.5-2 fold) in both uterine and pancreatic cancer cells. The PPAR agonist, rosiglitatzone, markedly (> 90%) reduced EGFR-driven MUC1 expression detected by antibodies directed against the MUC1 ECD and CT. Preliminary studies indicate that rosiglitazone effects on EGFR-driven MUC1 expression is indirect. Furthermore, rosiglitazone treatments enhanced EGFR degradation via the lysosomal degradation pathway in the presence of EGF-family ligands in both uterine and pancreatic cancer cell lines. A combination of biochemical and molecular biological assays have been used to identify the transcriptional and signal transduction pathways activated by EGFR, leading to increased MUC1 expression and the impact of AG1478 and rosiglitazone on these events. Understanding the molecular basis of how these agents reduce MUC1 expression may offer novel therapeutic avenues to improve cancer chemotherapies.']",

According to Chinese cancer registry annual report in 2012, esophagus cancer accounts for nearly 1 in 10 of all cancer deaths. Despite the fact that much progress has been made in diagnosis and systemic chemotherapy regimens, the overall prognosis of esophagus cancer is disappointing. The 5-year survival rate, all stages included, is around 1525%. There remains a significant unmet medical need for esophagus cancer treatment.EGFR expression was reported in 3090% esophagus cancers and overexpression of EGFR was found to be associated with poorer survival. Unlike colon cancer, K-ras mutation was less frequently found in esophagus cancer (510%), suggesting EGFR pathway blockade might bring therapeutic benefit to those patients with EGFR activation or overexpression. In this study, as of November 2013, 35 surgical esophagus tumor samples were collected from a local hospital in Shanghai. 31 of the 35 samples were identified as squamous cell carcinoma. EGFR gene amplification, protein expression and K-ras mutation were studied. In addition, 9 patient derived esophagus cancer xenograft models (PDX) were developed and anti-tumor effect of a novel and highly potent EGFR inhibitor was evaluated in 6 PDX models.Positive EGFR protein expression was found in 66% (23/35) of esophageal cancer samples. EGFR gene amplifications were observed in 9% patients (3/35). In 9 established PDX models, 7 of them showed EGFR expression and 2 with EGFR gene amplification. No K-ras mutation was observed in the 9 models. A novel and highly potent EGFR inhibitor (EGFRi), developed by Hutchison and currently being evaluated in phase I clinical trials in China, demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in several PDX models with tumor growth inhibition in a range of 70% to >100%. One PDX model with EGFR gene amplification and overexpression exhibited the highest sensitivity to EGFRi with remarkable tumor regression. EGFR signaling transduction was evaluated and the EGFRi inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream signaling molecules AKT and ERK.In conclusion, EGFR expression and/or gene amplification was frequently found in Chinese esophagus cancer. EGFR inhibition resulted in potent anti-tumor effect in multiple patient derived esophagus cancer models carrying EGFR amplifications or high expression, suggesting the potential benefit that anti-EGFR agents might bring to esophagus cancer patients with abnormal EGFR activation.']",

Erlotinib (E) inhibits HER1 tyrosine kinase signalling and is widely registered for treatment of relapsed NSCLC. By inhibiting extracellular receptor dimerisation, as well as internal signal transduction through HER1, the combination of E and P would be expected to result in extensive blockade of HER signalling.

We further revealed the role of metabolic stress in dasatinib-induced EGFR degradation and apoptosis. Dasatinib decreased cellular ATP, and activated AMPK activation and induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) as well. Inhibition or knockdown of AMPK reversed dasatinib-induced EGFR degradation, and pharmacological activation of AMPK led to ER stress and EGFR degradation. Addition of ER stress inhibitor to dasatinib reversed EGFR degradation and apoptosis, and pharmacologic activation of ER stress resulted in EGFR degradation.

It has been identified as an oncogenic driver in various malignancies and is currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic target. To date, MET exon 14 skipping by sequencing and MET amplification by FISH have been found to have potential clinical utility in predicting those patients who may derive benefit from MET-targeted therapy. However, little research has been conducted on alternative technologies to FISH such as CISH, which does not require a dark room and can be interpreted by a board-certified pathologist. The purpose of this study is to report our experience with MET amplification across solid tumors using CISH.A retrospective analysis was done on 26,619 specimens analyzed for MET amplification by CISH at a CLIA-certified lab (Caris Life Sciences). The validated CISH assay, previously validated against a FISH assay, utilized a gene copy number > 5 to assess amplification. Concordance and correlative studies were done in MET-amplified, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens analyzed using a cMET IHC (SP44, 2+ or 3+ staining intensity in 50% or more tumor cell membrane) analyzing protein expression. Correlative studies involving co-existing aberrations, including PD-L1 (SP142, any intensity in at least 50% of tumor cells), in this MET-amplified, NSCLC cohort were also performed.MET amplification utilizing CISH was 0.7% (188/26,619) overall. MET-amplified solid tumors included carcinomas such as NSCLC (3.1%, 87/2767), gastric adenocarcinoma (3.8%, 11/293), esophageal and esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (3.3%, 11/338), and endometrial carcinoma (0.4%, 9/2020) along with non-carcinomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (1.0%, 5/510), uterine sarcoma (1.3%, 5/400), melanoma (0.4%, 2/538), and rare tumors such as placental-site trophoblastic tumor (100%, 1/1) and prostatic neuroendocrine tumor (100%, 1/1). A sub-analysis of MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens demonstrated co-occurring protein overexpression in 92.6% (75/81) of cases. These same MET-amplified, NSCLC specimens were found to have EGFR pathogenic/presumed pathogenic mutations (19.7%, 15/76), ALK rearrangements (2.5%, 2/80), and PD-L1 overexpression (27.5%, 14/51). ROS1 rearrangements were not detected in this NSCLC cohort (0%, 0/76).Our data suggest MET amplification detection utilizing CISH is a viable option for identifying MET-driven cancers. The presence of MET across various solid tumors contrasts with biomarkers like HER2, which are exclusive to carcinomas. A sub-analysis of our NSCLC population shows MET-amplified tumors contains a similar molecular distribution to the general NSCLC population.

Angiogenesis does not only depend on endothelial cell invasion and proliferation', ' it also requires pericyte coverage of vascular sprouts for vessel stabilization. These processes are coordinated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). A significant portion of research on tumor angiogenesis has focused on VEGF and its blockage with the expectation that dramatic results would be demonstrated in cancer patients as previously documented in animal models. Vandetanib, also known as ZD6474, is an antagonist of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or HER1 or ErbB1). It is an orally bioavailable small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of multiple growth factors, and is now available in the US for the treatment of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Methods', ' ZD 6474 monomer was purchased modified to add a fluorescent dye (6-FAM). Its coupled ZD 6474 dimer was also prepared using a PEG linker, similarly with FAM fluorescent dye. The two compounds were compared in a series of in vitro studies using human endothelial cell (HUVECs) and several cancer cell lines. We first looked at VEGFR binding affinity and specificity with cell uptake and blocking study. Then, the effects on cellular viability and angiogenesis were compared using with tubular formation of HUVECs in vitro, also matrigel plug assay, and bio-distribution test on VEGF over expressed U87 human glioma tumor model in vivo.

Despite the use of anti-EGFR targeted therapies, prognosis is still poor for patients whose tumors harbor the defective receptor. The need to find novel biomarkers for early/companion diagnosis and targets for the development of novel therapies remains strong. Since polyisoprenylated methylated protein methyl esterase (PMPMEase) is a critical enzyme of the polyisoprenylation pathway whose inhibition causes cancer cell death, the objective was to determine whether it is overexpressed and/or hyperactive in lung cancers in which case, it might serve as a possible diagnostic biomarker or drug target.METHODS', ' Tissue microarrays (TMAs) consisting of 416 cores from 416 separate normal lung and lung cancer cases were analyzed for PMPMEase expression.

The AsPC-1+CAFs PF-299 treated tumors were 4.1% smaller than placebo treated tumors (p=0.99), while BxPC-3+CAFs PF-299 treated tumor were 26% smaller than the placebo treated group (p=0.05). Immunoblot analysis of AsPC-1/BxPC-3+CAFs xenografts confirmed PF-299 mediated inhibition of both EGFR and ErbB3 mediated signaling.Conclusion', ' We demonstrated that PF-299 targets multiple ErbB receptors, including ErbB3.

        "Background":"['Background', ' Overexpression of Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) in cancer was associated with poor outcome and high chances of recurrence before the development of anti-HER2 agents. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting HER2 based on its antibody component trastuzumab. After internalization of T-DM1/HER2, Lys-MCC-DM1, a tubulin binding agent is released in the cytoplasm. In spite of therapeutic advances, acquired resistance to treatment remains a major obstacle. A better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to T-DM1 is necessary to improve treatment regimens for HER2-overexpressing cancer patients. We have developed and characterized resistance models to T-DM1 in order to describe underlying resistance mechanisms and develop alternative strategies.Methods', ' To develop in vitro T-DM1 resistance models, HER2-overexpressing esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line OE-19 was exposed to increasing doses of T-DM1 several months in the absence or presence of cyclosporin A (CsA, an inhibitor of MDR1 transporter). Resistance models were called OE-19 TR (exposed to T-DM1) and OE-19 TCR (exposed to T-DM1 and CsA). To characterize the resistance models, sensitivity to T-DM1 was assessed by MTT assay, Annexin V-PI staining and xCELLigence. Cell cycle distribution was assessed by propidium iodide using flow cytometry. Cross-resistance was studied by MTT assay. Expression of HER2, ABC transporters and tubulin was studied by rt-qPCR, flow cytometry and/or Western Blot. An expression profile of sensitive and resistant cells to T-DM1 was performed using a pan-genomic Illumina cDNA array.Results', ' After prolonged exposure of OE-19 cells to T-DM1, IC50 value is 18-fold higher in TR cells and 21-fold higher in TCR cells and both models become less sensitive to T-DM1-induced apoptosis. T-DM1 induced G2/M arrest in OE-19 sensitive cells but not in resistant cells. We found that resistant cells become less sensitive to trastuzumab but remain sensitive to other HER2-targeted therapies such as lapatinib, as well as to a variety of chemotherapy agents. Among the resistant cells, a subpopulation with increased expression MDR1 was identified in OE-19 TR and TCR. Concerning the expression of the main targets of T-DM1 (HER2 and tubulin); we found that HER2 expression and total  and  tubulin expression and content remained unchanged. However the isoforms 2 and 3 were overexpressed in both resistant models. A transcriptomic approach of T-DM1 resistant cells showed modification in adhesion junctions and focal adhesions.Conclusion', ' Prolonged exposure of the OE-19 cell line to T-DM1 resulted in resistance to this immunoconjugate. We are working on describing the resistance mechanisms to T-DM1, which are important to understand cancer progression in patients receiving this therapy.

DLTs were evaluated during Cycle 1. AZD8931 dosing started at 160 mg bid (based on monotherapy study results; NCT00637039). Results', ' 20 pts with advanced refractory tumors (16 breast) received AZD8931. Median exposure to AZD8931 was 52 days and to P was 3 cycles.

        "Background":"['Background', ' The transcription factor Krppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is essential for normal homeostasis, stemness, and tumorigenesis. Typically, KLF5 functions as a transcriptional activator, including in esophageal epithelia where KLF5 promotes keratinocyte proliferation and migration by activating EGFR and ILK, respectively, and prevents transformation by activating Notch1. Yet, the function of KLF5 is context dependent, and mutation of the tumor suppressor p53 switches KLF5 from a transcriptional activator to a repressor of p21Waf1/Cip1 and from pro-proliferative to anti-proliferative. Interestingly, KLF5 also inhibits p53 itself, though the mechanism of this inhibition is unknown. We hypothesized that the functional switch of KLF5 from transcriptional activator to repressor involves the recruitment of a co-repressor.Methods', ' Primary human esophageal keratinocytes immortalized with hTERT were stably infected with inducible lentivirus containing shRNA against KLF5 or Sin3A. p53 mRNA and protein levels were assessed by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting, respectively, and p53 protein stability was evaluated by pulse-chase experiments. We employed ChIP across a 4 kb region on the p53 gene, from 2 kb upstream to 2 kb downstream of the transcription start site, to identify the region of KLF5 binding on p53. Promoter activity was assessed with a series of luciferase reporters containing varying lengths of p53 and its upstream regulatory region. Protein-protein interaction was examined by co-IP.Results', ' KLF5 knockdown significantly increased p53 both at the mRNA and protein levels. In unstressed cells p53 protein undergoes rapid degradation such that p53 levels are typically low. Yet, with KLF5 knockdown, despite increased p53 protein levels, we saw no changes in p53 protein stability. By ChIP, we identified a region of KLF5 binding to p53 between -600 to -356 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Several other KLF family members can interact with the co-repressor Sin3A, and we found that Sin3A also complexed with KLF5 in human primary esophageal keratinocytes. Knockdown of Sin3A abolished the inhibitory effect of KLF5 on p53, resulting in elevated p53 expression, growth inhibition, and increased apoptosis.Conclusion', ' KLF5 transcriptionally represses p53 via the co-repressor Sin3A. Thus, KLF5 promotes cell proliferation in normal keratinocytes by both activating pro-growth signals and inhibiting the brake machinery of the cell cycle.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Cellular expression of EGFR ligands is tightly regulated and is thought to be maintained by an autocrine signaling component in colorectal cancer cells. More importantly, the expression levels of individual ligands have gained recent interest since their expression of their mRNA was found to be linked to anti-EGFR therapy response. Since the expression of these ligands can be regulated by EGFR signaling elicited by EGF, we decided to investigate the contribution of MAPK as well as the PI3K axis, to EREG expression, in K-Ras wild-type colon cancer cells. Methods Colon cancer cells were used to interrogate EGFR downstream signaling. Several inhibitors targeting the ErbBs and the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways were used to dissect the pathways downstream of EGFR maintaining ligand mRNA levels in the lim1215 colon cancer cell line. Additionally, we used ER and AR reporter assays to selectively evaluate involvement of the EGFR pathway in transcriptional regulation of the pathway. Consequently, blockade and activation of EGFR pathway members was assessed by Western Blot. Results We show that Ereg and Areg mRNA levels are specifically maintained by erbb1 signaling. Treatment of lim1215 cells with inhibitors blocking Erbb1 (cetuximab) or ErbB1/Erbb2 (lapatinib) did results in near complete inhibition of Ereg and Areg expression in Kras/pi3K wild-type cells, while blockade of ErbB2 alone (which is activated in these cells) with Trastuzumab did not decrease Ereg nor Areg mRNA levels. Downstream of EGFR, we show that MEK signaling is not required for maintenance of EREG and AREG levels in lim1215 cells. Conversely, blockade of PI3K signaling by Akt inhibitors or PI3K inhibitors abolished EREG mRNA levels in these cells. This was reflected by the ability of overexpressed Akt to induce EREG and AREG reporter activity in 293T cells. In contrast, this activation could be rescued by the addition of Akt and PI3K inhibitors, but not MEK inhibitors in cellular media. Conclusions In this work we show that PI3K signaling is required for the transcription of EGFR ligands in colon cancer cells. In this regard, this provides additional insights to the recent findings that link PI3K/Akt signaling to Receptor Tyrosine Kinase expression and activation in cancer cells. Therefore, a global understanding of the signaling networks that control ligand availability and receptor abundance will be crucial in combining ErbB pathway inhibitors in the treatment of kras wild-type colon cancers.']",

Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been associated with poor outcomes in cervical cancer (CC). Clinical trials have shown that EGFR inhibitors are effective against CC (JCO 2011). Nuclear YB-1 expression correlates with EGFR expression in various types of cancer.  Methods', '  Nuclear YB-1 expression was immunohistochemically analyzed in tissue specimens obtained from 204 CC patients who underwent surgery. Associations of nuclear YB-1 expression with clinicopathological factors such as survival and EGFR (HER1 and HER2) expression were investigated.   Results', '  Nuclear YB-1 expression was observed in 41 (20%) of 204 cases and correlated with stage, tumor diameter, stromal invasion, and lymph-node metastasis. Nuclear YB-1 expression also correlated with both HER1 expression (p=0.0114) and HER2 expression (p=0.0053). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that nuclear YB-1 expression was significantly associated with poor outcomes in terms of progression-free survival (p=0.0033) and overall survival (p=0.0003). On multivariate analysis, stromal invasion, parametrial invasion, and  nuclear YB-1 expression were independent predictors of survival.  Conclusions', '  Nuclear YB-1 expression is a prognostic marker and correlates with EGFR expression in CC.']",

Here, we report the PRO results.  Methods', '  364 pts were randomized (2', '1) to receive A or GC. PROs were measured using EORTC questionnaires QLQ-C30/LC13 at baseline and q3w until progression. Changes of 10 points (scale 0100) were considered clinically significant. Analyses of cough, dyspnea and pain were prespecified. Time to deterioration (1st 10-point worsening from baseline) was analyzed using a stratified log-rank test. Percentage improved/worsened by 10 points or stable was determined. Mean scores over time were estimated using longitudinal (mixed-effects growth curve) models.  Results', '  Compliance on treatment with questionnaires was >90%. Baseline symptom burden was low (cough', ' 35; dyspnea', ' 25; pain', ' 24). Compared with GC, therapy with A significantly delayed time to deterioration for cough (HR=0.45; p=0.0001), dyspnea (HR=0.54; p<0.0001) and pain (HR=0.70; p=0.03).

Mean scores over time for cough, dyspnea and pain also significantly favored A. Consistent with their safety profiles, a significantly higher proportion of A-treated pts had worsening of diarrhea, sore mouth and dysphagia, while fatigue, nausea, and vomiting were significantly worse with GC. Overall, therapy with A significantly improved global health-related quality of life (HRQoL; p<0.0001), physical (p<0.0001), role (p=0.01) and social (p<0.001) functioning compared with GC.

        "Background":"['Activating mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are found in 5-15% of non small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) and are targets of NSCLC treatment. However, most patients treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors eventually acquire drug resistance, pointing to the need of evaluating other molecules as potential targets for developing new therapy for NSCLC. The protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SHP2 mediates signaling of growth factor receptors including that of EGFR. SHP2 is activated by EGFR mutants in lung adenocarcinoma. Inhibition of SHP2 with the SHP2 PTP inhibitor SPI-112Me or SHP2 knockdown suppressed proliferation of EGFR-dependent HCC827 and H1975 cells. To assess the role of Shp2 in the transgenic mouse model of EGFR mutant-driven lung cancer, we generated transgenic mice carrying a doxycycline (dox)-inducible, PTP-defective SHP2 (tetO-SHP2CSDA). Bitransgenic CCSP-rtTA/tetO-SHP2CSDA mice were crossed with tetO-EGFRL858R mice. F1 offspring of dox-induced transgenic mice were analyzed. Erk1/2 and Src were activated by EGFRL858R in bitransgenic CCSP-rtTA/tetO-EGFRL858R mice. Both of them were suppressed by SHP2CSDA in CCSP-rtTA/tetO-EGFRL858R/tetO-SHP2CSDA tritransgenic mice. Importantly, expression of SHP2CSDA significantly inhibited EGFRL858R-induced lung tumor in the tritransgenic mice.

Most commonly CAFs are identified by de novo expression of -smooth muscle actin (SMA) incorporated into stress fibres generating enhanced contractility, which is associated with an enhanced secretory profile. Myofibroblasts promote a number of the hallmarks of malignancy, and clinical studies have shown that the presence of an SMA-rich stroma is associated with poor outcome in several cancers, suggesting that stromal targeting may be a useful therapeutic adjunct. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms regulating differentiation of the myofibroblastic CAF phenotype.Fibroblasts (HFFF2 and primary fibroblasts extracted and cultured from normal skin, esophageal and oral mucosa) were treated with TGF-1 to induce myofibroblast transdifferentiation. Target genes were suppressed using siRNA. Gene expression was examined using RNA-seq and qRT-PCR, and protein expression by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Myofibroblast function was examined using gel contraction assays while the effect of the myofibroblast secretion profile on cancer cell migration was assessed using Transwell migration assays.RNA-seq confirmed the upregulation of myofibroblast-associated genes (FN1, COL1A1, CTGF, ACTA2) in TGF-1-treated fibroblasts. Conversely, we found that the adaptor protein Eps8 was significantly down-regulated, and this occurred early in the transdifferentiation process. Eps8 sits at the heart of a complex system regulating reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and interacts with numerous intracellular proteins including palladin, F-actin and integrins. We found that siRNA knockdown of Eps8 in fibroblasts promoted myofibroblast differentiation, resulting in increased expression of SMA, stress fibre formation and cell contractility and promotion of cancer cell motility. Suppression of Eps8 expression sensitized fibroblasts to TGF-1 treatment and potentiated TGF-1 signalling, in part through transcriptional upregulation and increased phosphorylation of SMAD2.These data suggest that Eps8 expression provides tonic inhibition of myofibroblast transdifferentiation, at least in part by desensitization of cells to TGF-1 mediated by the regulation of SMAD2 expression. Loss of Eps8 expression may play an important role in the generation of an SMA-positive myofibroblastic CAF population.']",

        "Background":"['Integrin 64 is upregulated in pancreatic adenocarcinomas where it contributes to carcinoma cell invasion, in part, through its coordinated modulation of the transcriptome. Here, we find that integrin 64 signaling dramatically upregulates the expression of several genes involved in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, including amphiregulin (Areg), epiregulin (Ereg), and ectodomain cleavage protease MMP1. Notably, these genes correlate well with integrin 64 expression in publicly available pancreatic cancer databases. We previously reported that integrin 64 promotes HGF-stimulated migration and invasion; therefore, we tested the role of autocrine EGFR signaling in these processes. We discovered that blocking EGFR signaling with EGFR-specific blocking antibodies or an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor hindered HGF-stimulated pancreatic carcinoma cell chemotaxis and invasive growth in three-dimensional culture. Furthermore, we found that both Areg and Ereg are required for these autocrine effects, as knocking down either ligand prevented migration and invasion. Notably, AsPC1 cells, isolated from abdominal metastases, are not dependent on EGFR signaling for migration or invasion; thus suggesting a mechanism exists for circumventing EGFR dependency. We also demonstrated that HGF stimulates the secretion of Areg, which is dependent on integrin signaling pathways including MAPK, PI3K and PKC and that Areg was transported to the leading edge of cells treated with HGF. Moreover, MMP activity and integrin 64 signaling are required for Areg secretion. Finally, we found that EGFR is phosphorylated in response to HGF stimulation which was dependent on EGFR protein kinase activity; however, Met phosphorylation in response to HGF was unaffected by EGFR signaling. Taken together, we show that integrin 64 stimulates invasion by promoting autocrine EGFR signaling through the upregulation of key genes and facilitating HGF-stimulated EGFR ligand secretion.']",

        "Background":"['The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family consists of four members including HER1 (EGFR), HER2 (ErbB2), HER3 (ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4). Collectively this family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play critical roles in the etiology of several human cancers as well as a role in resistance to radiation therapy. In 2006, a study in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) indicated that using the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab in combination with radiation resulted in a 10% advantage of 3-year overall survival rate when compared to radiotherapy alone. This study highlighted the therapeutic utility of RTK blockade in combination with radiation. Studies investigating the role of HER3 in radiation response are limited. In the present study, we investigated whether or not HER3 blockade could enhance radiation therapy using the HER3 antibody U3-1287/AMG888. We screened a battery of cell lines from lung, HNSCC and colorectal tumor lines for HER3 expression. The results indicated that all 15 cell lines tested showed expression of HER3. In addition, U3-1287/AMG888 was able to block basal HER3 activity and radiation induced HER3 activation. Further, proliferation assays, using U3-1287/AMG888, indicated that HER3 blockade could block proliferation in SCC6, SCC1483, H226 cell lines, highlighting the importance of HER3 in these tumor cells. Clonogenic assays showed that U3-1287/AMG888 could sensitize these lines to radiation. Furthermore, -H2AX analyses, detected by immunofluorescence, lead to a statistically significant increase in apoptotic cells. Cell cycle analysis, 24 and 48 hours after U3-1287/AMG888 and radiation treatments resulted in a significant G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest. Annexin-V binding assays showed a significant increase in apoptosis in the U3-1287/AMG888 plus radiation group as compared to either agent alone. To determine if HER3 blockade using U3-1287/AMG888 could enhance radiation therapy in vivo we performed tumor growth delay experiments using SCC6, SCC1483 and H226 xenografts in nude mice. Mice were inoculated and treated with 1) IgG, 2) U3-1287/AMG888, 3) radiation or 4) the combination. The results of these experiments indicated that the combination of U3-1287/AMG888 and radiation had a strong impact on tumor growth in studies using single dose or fractionated dosing. Tumor analysis indicated that radiation treatment activated HER3 in vivo and U3-1287/AMG888 could abrogate this activation. Collectively our findings in vitro and in vivo suggest that U3-1287/AMG888 in combination with radiation has an impact on cell and tumor growth by impacting cell cycle progression, increasing apoptosis and increasing DNA damage. These findings suggest that HER3 may play a critical role in response to radiation therapy and blocking its activity may be of strong therapeutic benefit in human tumors.']",
