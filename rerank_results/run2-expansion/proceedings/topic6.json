To better understand non-V600 BRAF mutations in melanoma, characteristics of tumor and clinical outcomes were investigated.  Methods', \"  Clinical and pathologic data were collected retrospectively in patients (pts) with melanoma who had multi-gene mutation analysis (next-gene sequencing) at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Fisher's exact test was used for all comparisons.  Results\", '  We found 52 pts with non-V600 BRAF mutations, among whom 8 had NRAS/non-V600 co-mutations. Common non-V600 mutations were K601E (17.3%), G469E (15.4%), G469R (7.7%), D594G (5.8%), L597S (5.8%), and S467L (5.8%). Compared with V600E mutations as a control (n=82) , the presence of a non-V600 mutations was significantly associated with older age (median, 58 years vs 50; P=0.001), less superficial spreading type (13.6% vs 32.9%; P=0.02), more lentigo maligna type (20% vs 1.2%; P=0.001), more mucosal subtype (9.1% vs 1.2%; P=0.03), more head/neck primary tumor location (36.4% vs 15.9%; P=0.03), less lower extremity primary tumor location (4.5% vs 24.4%; P=0.003), more co-mutations with NRAS (15.4% vs 2.4%, p=0.005) and stage IV disease at initial diagnosis (31.8% vs 7.3%; P=0.0003).  Among the 33 pts with non-V600 mutant metastatic melanoma, 7 received selective BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi). Of the 5 evaluable patients (2 could not tolerate treatment), all had disease progression within 2 months.  Conclusions', '  Non-V600 BRAF mutant melanomas have more aggressive clinical characteristics, more likely to have co-mutations with NRAS, and not responsive to selective BRAFi than V600E mutations.

        "Background":"['Mutations in the B-raf oncogene constitutively activate the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, a key regulator of cell proliferation and survival. The most common BRAF mutation (V600E) occurs in approximately 70% of primary melanomas and 10% of colorectal cancers. Melanoma patients carrying the BRAF(V600) mutation respond with frequency of 80% to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib, while colon cancer patients respond at a rate of 5% only, indicative of intrinsic resistance. Moreover, clinical benefit is further limited by the rapid emergence of acquired resistance among vemurafenib responders. Combination therapy targeting both BRAF(V600E) and possible escape pathways appears to be a promising approach to reverse resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Here, we present the molecular characterization and in vitro chemosensitivity profiles of 20 melanoma and 20 human colorectal cancer cell lines. Four of the colon and 11 of the melanoma cell lines were established at Oncotest from patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX). Molecular profiles include the mutation status of BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS, and NRAS (exon sequencing) and protein levels for components of the MAPK, EGFR and PI3K/AKT pathways (Western blot analysis). Sensitivity profiles for inhibitors of BRAF, MEK, EGFR and PI3K were determined in vitro using a fluorescence-based survival and proliferation assay. Overcoming resistance to BRAF inhibitors was investigated by combination of vemurafenib with other inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway or inhibitors of potential escape pathways like EGFR, PI3K/AKT or c-MET and evaluated by combination index according to Chou-Talalay.In line with the clinical situation, the BRAF V600E substitution was found in 13/20 (65%) of the melanoma and only in 4/20 (20%) of the colon cancer cell lines. BRAF and NRAS mutations were mutually exclusive in melanoma cell lines and KRAS mutations did not occur at all. Among the colon cancer cell lines, in addition to the BRAF(v600E) mutation, alteration in KRAS (10/20 cell lines), PIK3CA (6/20) and NRAS (1/20) were detected. Chemosensitivity profiling revealed intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors for 3/13 (23%) BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines and for 3/4 (75%) BRAF(V600E) colon cancer cell lines. Reversal of the resistance of BRAF inhibitor-insensitive melanoma cell lines was recorded as synergism between vemurafenib and inhibitors of vasious kinases (c-MET, AKT, PI3K, MEK, or EGFR. A particularly strong synergistic interaction was found for vemurafenib and the c-MET inhibitor SU11274, irrespective of BRAF status. For colon cancer cell lines, the strongest synergisms were detected for the combinations of vemurafenib with inhibitors of c-MET, EGFR, PI3K, AKT and MEK.Displaying similar mutation and chemosensitivity profiles as melanomas and colon cancers in the clinic, the present cell line panels represent valuable tools to investigate the reversal of resistance towards BRAF inhibitors.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Resistance to targeted therapies represents a key hurdle in the treatment of cancer. Preclinical data suggest that resistance is frequently driven by redundant growth factor signaling. For example, HGF has been reported to mediate resistance to BRAF inhibitors in V600E BRAF mutant melanoma. Furthermore, clinical data support these findings as circulating and tumor HGF levels have been shown to correlate with outcome in BRAF mutant melanoma patients treated with vemurafenib. In this study, we evaluated the ability of HGF / MET signaling to attenuate the effects of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in the context of V600E BRAF and NRAS mutant cell lines. Our data suggest that combined blockade of MET and MAPK pathway signaling may be required for a robust and durable clinical response in melanoma.Methods', ' To confirm the ability of HGF to rescue V600E BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines from the effects of vemurafenib, G361 and SKMEL5 cells were treated with vemurafenib alone or in combination with HGF. Time lapse imaging, viability assays and cell cycle analysis were used to measure treatment effects. Analogous experiments were performed with the selective MEK inhibitor PD0325901. Combinations of a potent and selective MET inhibitor (Compound A) with vemurafenib or PD0325901 were tested to evaluate their ability to attenuate the HGF-mediated resistance. To identify other cell lines rescued by HGF, thirteen V600E BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines were treated with a dose response matrix of vemurafenib and HGF. The ability of six additional growth factors to rescue cells from the effects of vemurafenib was also tested. Three NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines were also screened for HGF-mediated resistance to PD0325901.Results', ' Nine of thirteen V600E BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines were rescued from the effects of vemurafenib by co-treatment with HGF. Detailed analysis of G361 and SKMEL5 cells revealed that HGF was also capable of rescuing the cells from the effects of PD0325901. This HGF-mediated rescue was attenuated by treatment with combinations of vemurafenib + compound A or PD0325901 + compound A. Mechanistic cell cycle analysis of the HGF-mediated rescue of vemurafenib in G361 cells revealed an increase in proliferating cells and a reduction in growth arrested cells, whereas rescue of PD0325901 treatment occurred through a reduction in the percentage of dead or dying cells. Of the seven growth factors tested, HGF was the predominate growth factor capable of conferring resistance to vemurafenib. Furthermore, HGF rescued one of three NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines from the effects of PD0325901, highlighting the breadth of HGF-mediated resistance in melanoma cell lines.Conclusion', ' These findings demonstrate the potential role for HGF / MET signaling in mediating resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in melanoma, and support the clinical evaluation of MET kinase inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies to HGF in this setting.']",

        "Background":"['BRAF and MEK inhibitors induce striking tumor regressions in BRAF V600E melanoma patients. However, relapse occurs in the majority of patients within several months. Reported resistance mechanisms include acquisition of NRAS mutations, PDGFR or IGF1R activation, Cot amplification, or truncated BRAF upregulation. We report here that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), neuregulin-1 (NRG1), and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) cause robust resistance in vitro to BRAF or MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines. NRAS mutant lines were similarly resistant to MEK inhibition in the presence of these growth factors. By contrast other mitogenic factors such as PDGF, EGF, NGF, BDNF, MSP, MDK, GRO, and IGF1 did not maintain cell viability or growth. HGF, NRG1 and FGF2 prevented growth arrest and cell death and in some cell lines maintained cells in progressive growth. In addition, HGF and NRG1 could prevent growth arrest after dual treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Western analysis revealed that HGF and NRG1 reactivated Erk signaling and activated S6RP and AKT phosphorylation. Combined pharmacological inhibition mTor signaling and Akt signaling was required to fully block growth factor-mediated proliferation. In addition, small molecule Met inhibitors and an anti-HGF antibody blocked HGF-mediated resistance, while lapatinib and an anti-NRG1 antibody blocked NRG1-mediated resistance. While combined Akt and mTor inhibition potently inhibited cell line growth independent of BRAF or MEK inhibition, lapatinib and Met inhibitors had minimal effect on growth, suggesting potential for less adverse events with receptor inhibitors. In vitro co-culture experiments revealed that primary cells present in normal skin can cause resistance, and we have identified growth factors produced by these cells that contribute to resistance. We are analyzing receptor activation (Met and Erbb3) and FGF2 expression in wildtype, NRAS, and BRAF mutant primary melanoma samples. In future experiments we plan to test clinical samples from patients treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors, and we hypothesize that HGF, NRG1, and FGF2 signaling is elevated in patients with poor initial responses or relapse to BRAF or MEK inhibitors.']",

Recent progresses have permitted the discovery of several activating mutations in the MAPK pathway that involves notably the BRAF and NRAS genes and have allowed the development of new targeted therapies. However response to these therapies is highly variable and the occurrence of new activating mutations refrain these progresses. Indeed investigation of the molecular profile of the tumors could help anticipate the occurrence of resistance. However given the multiplicity of redundant kinase pathways this strategy is hardly implementable today. Consequently the identification of other predictive biomarkers is of critical importance.DNA repair, a set of highly coordinated mechanisms, are the effectors of the DNA Damage Response (DDR). They are under the regulation of numerous transduction pathways (PIK3CA, MAPK, etc). Because of this downstream position, we aimed at investigating if the stratification of metastatic melanoma cells, based on the comparative quantification of multiple DNA Repair pathways (DNA Repair Enzyme Signature) reflected the functionality of the signaling pathways.For this purpose, we screened a biobank constituted by a set of 44 samples prepared from metastatic melanoma lymph nodes, dissociated and frozen right after surgery. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the cryopreserved cells. We then used a multiplexed Enzymatic DNA Excision/Synthesis Repair Assay on biochip to simultaneously quantify several DNA Repair pathways (Nucleotide and Base Excision Repair, Inter-Strand Cross-Link Repair). We thus obtained a specific and comprehensive overview of the DNA Repair capacities. Using the normalized data and hierarchical classification, patients were stratified into 3 significantly different main classes. Mutational status (BRAF V600E, NRAS Q61K and NRAS Q61R mutations) was available for most samples. We found out that 6 out of the 7 NRAS mutated samples were clustered in the same group and that 8 out of the 12 BRAF mutated samples were clustered in another group. Two BRAF mutated samples were atypical and clustered alone.Our results suggested that some mutations in the regulating signaling pathway impacted the DDR and were associated with specific DNA Repair Enzyme Signatures.However further studies are needed to more deeply examine if specific combination of DNA Repair-related parameters could serve as surrogate biomarker of signal transduction pathway functionality and could have a predictive value regarding the response to therapy.']",

It is especially prevalent in malignant melanoma, where it occurs in 40-60% of the cases. The most common BRAF mutation is the valine to glutamate substitution at position 600 of the kinase (V600E). This substitution, seen in ninety percent of the BRAF cases, leads to constitutive activation of the kinase, and the downstream MEK-ERK pathway. Appropriately, several drugs have been designed to inhibit BRAF, with a broad range of outcomes in clinical trials. Unfortunately, all patients, including those showing complete responses, develop resistance to single agent therapy.

Genomic DNA was hybridized on SurePrint G4 human CGH microarrays 2 x 440 K (Agilent). Copy number gains and losses were  0.3 or  -0.3 on a log2 scale, respectively (Nexus BioDiscovery, Inc). In 119 melanoma tumor samples, 45% had BRAF mutations, 24% NRAS mutations, and 24% without either (designated WT), CNVs were evaluated in an initial set of 26 genes known to be involved in melanoma pathogenesis. Overall genomic instability, as measured by number of genes with CNVs, was associated with poor ECOG performance status (P=0.007) and marginally significant for more organs with metastatic involvement (P=0.06), and is consistent with other studies suggesting that genomic instability is a predictor of worsened outcome. We further explored the association between copy number and somatic mutation status. Not surprisingly, BRAF gene amplification was observed in 91% of BRAF mutant melanoma tumor samples (P<0.001, as compared to 66% of NRAS/WT samples). The average value of BRAF copy number was higher in tumor samples with BRAF V600K mutations compared to samples with BRAF V600E mutations (1.11 v 0.55, P<0.001). MET, also on chr 7, was found to be amplified in 59% of BRAF mutated melanoma tumor samples. The average value of MET copy number was also higher in BRAF V600K mutant compared to BRAF V600E mutant melanoma (0.53 v 0.27, P=0.04), which may contribute to the differing clinical behaviors of melanomas with the two mutations. Patients with BRAF copy number gain had a trend towards lower overall response rate to either treatment compared to diploid (15.2% v 29.6%, OR=0.37, P=0.08). Patients with NRAS copy number gain receiving CPS had significantly improved overall survival compared to patients receiving CP alone (HR=0.35, P=0.03) in multivariable Cox model. We had previously found a trend suggesting an improved clinical response and PFS in patients with NRAS mutant melanoma treated with CPS as compared to CP. Our present study demonstrates an association between CNVs and treatment response to CP or CPS, as well as an association with somatic mutations. In addition, distinct cooperating genomic events identified in somatic mutation cohorts, such as MET and BRAF V600K gain, may contribute to the pathogenesis of melanoma tumors.']",

CRM1 (chromosome region maintenance 1, XPO1) is the exclusive exporter of many TSPs. We hypothesized that CRM1 inhibition can be used as a therapeutic target in melanoma. The growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of KPT-185, KPT-276 and KPT-330, potent, small molecule, selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINEs) were evaluated in a panel of human metastatic melanoma cell lines using an MTS assay and Annexin V/PI staining, respectively. The weak CRM1 inhibitor, KPT-185 trans-isomer, and DMSO vehicle were controls in all assays. CRM1 protein was expressed in melanoma cell lines regardless of molecular profile (BRAF, NRAS, TP53) as determined by immunoblot. SINEs inhibited cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner and induced apoptosis at nanomolar concentrations (range=139.7nM - 2.41M). Both BRAF wild type (WT) and BRAF V600E mutant lines were sensitive to apoptosis by SINE, but BRAF V600E lines had an 8.8-fold lower IC50s as compared to BRAF (WT) lines (p=0.018). The cytostatic and pro-apoptotic effects of CRM1 inhibition were associated with nuclear accumulation of p53, and p21 induction in A375 and CHL-1 melanoma cell lines with functional p53 at time points prior to apoptosis, while pERK accumulated in melanoma cells regardless of p53 status. In pharmacokinetic studies in mice, KPT-276 and KPT-330 showed >50% oral bioavailability with Cmax >5M.

Methods', ' The oncocarta mutation panel was used to assess muations in 31 melanoma lines and short-term cultures. Each line was tested for viability in MTS assays and apoptosis by subG1 PI fractions over 72 hours. Western blots were used to measure Bcl-2 family protein expression. Results', ' There were 7 lines with no detectable mutations, 10 with mutations in NRAS or KRAS,13 with BRAF mutations and one with mutated cKit.Apoptosis induction was highest in the lines with mutated BRAF and correlated inversely with cell viability except for 2 lines with mutated CDK4 (R24c) which had low viability and low apoptosis.Inhibition of caspases indicated that apoptosis was the main mechanism for reduced cell viabilty. Induction of apoptosis correlated with upregulation of the proapoptotic BH3 protein Bim as reported in previous studies on the MEK inhibitor UO126. In particular there was selective upregulation of the short form of Bim and this correlated with induction of apoptosis. There were no significant changes in the the other BH3 only proteins PUMA or NOXA Combination of a MEK inhibitor with the BRAF inhibitor had strong potentiating effects on cell lines that were relatively resistant to the BRAF inhibitor. Conclusions', ' These studies confirm that the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 induces apoptosis in human melanoma with mutated BRAF at concentrations achievable in vivo.

        "Background":"['Malignant melanomas account for a substantial proportion of cancers worldwide and are largely resistant to conventional therapy. The heterogeneity and the invasiveness of melanomas present notable challenges for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, several mutations in RAF, RAS, and PTEN were identified that allow for prognosis of cancer development and progression. Therefore, inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway form attractive candidates for molecular-based targeted treatment of melanoma cancer. Here, we present the molecular characterization and chemosensitivity profiling of 18 human melanoma cell lines. Eight of these were established by Oncotest from human tumor xenografts originally derived from primary patient material. The molecular profiling included mutational analysis for BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS, NRAS, TP53, and PTEN by sequencing. The chemosensitivity profiles were determined in vitro using a fluorescence-based cytotoxicity assay and included commonly used chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of melanoma, targeted agents (sorafenib and bortezomib) and various BRAF (PLX-4032, PLX-4720, GDC-0879) and MEK (CI-1040, PD0325901) inhibitors. The clinically relevant BRAF V600E substitution was the most prevalent mutation and was found in more than 50% of the melanoma cell lines. The chemosensitivity profiling revealed diverse patterns of selectivity and potency with mean IC50 values between 0.4 nM (vinblastine) and 8.3 M (carboplatin). Each of the BRAF inhibitors tested was clearly more active in melanoma cell lines carrying a BRAF mutation. On average, IC50 values of BRAF inhibitors were more than 20-fold lower for the BRAF V600E mutated cell lines compared to the wild type cell lines. However, the BRAF mutated cell line MEXF 462NL was resistant towards BRAF inhibitors and it is warranted to compare its gene expression profile and mutational status with BRAF mutated cell lines responding to BRAF inhibitors. By using an ex vivo clonogenic assay, similar activity patterns for BRAF inhibitors were found, with mutated BRAF tumor xenografts showing markedly higher sensitivity. Potential synergistic activity of BRAF inhibitors with other inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway or with standard chemotherapeutic agents will be presented. The mutational status of selected cancer related genes, as well as responsiveness towards many cytotoxic and targeted agents was analyzed for 18 melanoma cell lines. This extensive genotypic and phenotypic characterization makes this melanoma cell line panel a valuable tool for in vitro profiling of novel compounds, in particular inhibitors of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway.']",

Aberrant signalling via the MAPK pathway is commonly seen in cancer. RAF inhibitors such as Dabrafenib and Vemurafenib have been approved for the treatment of unresectable and metastatic BRAF mutant melanoma, but these agents lack efficacy in BRAF mutant colorectal cancer (CRC), partly because of EGFR-mediated feedback reactivation of the MAPK pathway via CRAF. Furthermore, RAF inhibitor treatment of RAS-mutant, BRAF wildtype melanomas has been associated with other skin cancers, such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma due to MAPK pathway paradoxical activation mediated by CRAF. There is therefore a clinical need for novel agents targeting the MAPK pathway that do not have these undesirable properties. Here we present, REDX05358 that demonstrates subnanomolar binding affinity for BRAF and CRAF with high selectivity profile against a panel of 468 kinases that exhibits negligible paradoxical activation due to inhibition of both RAF monomers and dimers. As a result, REDX05358 not only inhibits MAPK signalling in BRAF V600E mutant tumor cells, but also in those harbouring NRAS and KRAS mutations. Furthermore, REDX05358 does not induce feedback reactivation of the pathway through its ability to sustain inhibition of MAPK signalling in CRC cell lines. Correspondingly, profiling of REDX05358 in a panel of CRC, melanoma and NSCLC cell lines shows it has potent anti-proliferative activity in cell lines harbouring BRAF or RAS mutations. REDX05358 is an orally bioavailable, well tolerated small molecule that has demonstrated in vivo efficacy in BRAF V600E CRC xenograft model. In contrast, first generation inhibitors such as Vemarafenib and Dabrafanib have been reported to be ineffective in this genetic background in CRC cell lines and patients.

        "Background":"[\"Mutant BRAF gene can lead to uncontrolled cell growth through overactivation of RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling pathway. BRAF V600E mutation occurs in approximately 40% to 50% of melanomas. Although BRAF inhibitors have been used to successfully treat melanomas containing the BRAF V600E mutation, patients often become resistant to BRAF inhibitors within a few months. A number of studies have indicated that secondary mutations such as NRAS or NF1 are significantly associated with BRAF resistance by sequencing patient samples. However, due to the genetic heterogeneity commonly observed in tumors, it is unclear if those secondary mutations already existed within low percentage subclones or if they were acquired through drug treatment. It's yet to be determined whether such genetic variants are only associated with resistance, or they actually cause the resistance. In this study, we used genome editing CRISPR technology to generate a drug resistant mutation NRAS Q61K within A375 melanoma cell line which naturally contains BRAFV600E. When compared to the parental line, this isogenic cell model demonstrated that genetically modified NRAS gene at the endogenous level directly leads to a significant resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Method and results\", ' Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed and built to guide Cas9 to bind and cut desired regions in the NRAS gene target. Melanoma cell line A375 was co-transfected with the single guide and CRIPSR all-in-one plasmid alongside donor plasmid. Transfected cells were sorted into single cells and expanded for subsequent screening of desired gene mutation events. The introduction of NRAS Q61K mutation in the cells was then confirmed via Sanger sequencing and NGS at the genetic level and transcriptional level. Drug responses to BRAF specific inhibitors and non-specific chemotherapy drugs were compared between A375 NRAS Q61K isogenic cell line and parental cell line in 2D and 3D culture environment. Testing results demonstrated that the isogenic cell line created by CRISPR showed significant resistance to BRAF inhibitor in comparison to the parental control in both 2D and 3D culture environment. In summary, we utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing platform to target endogenous loci in human cells and create the intended genetic mutation event. This new approach provides direct bio-functional evidence of acquiring a drug resistant gene drives tumor cells survival under targeted therapeutic treatment. Furthermore, unlike conventional drug resistant cell models that have been developed through drug selection, the A375 NRAS Q61K isogenic cell line represents a new type of drug resistant model that contains a defined genetic resistance mechanism. It reserves the permanent and genetically stable resistance characteristics without being maintained in drug selection culture environment.

        "Background":"['Dysregulation of ERK signaling is a common event in malignancy. Receptor activation of RAS leads to dimerization and activation of RAF kinase, which in turn activates ERK. Physiologic activation of the pathway is limited by ERK dependent feedback inhibition of RAS activation and other components of the pathway. Oncogenic mutations and translocations of RAF family members have been identified in many human tumors and serve as drivers of tumor growth. We now show that these mutants are active despite feedback inhibition of RAS and that this is associated with dysregulated ERK output. All translocations and almost all of the RAF mutants tested so far form RAS-independent constitutive dimers, the activity of which is dependent on their dimerization. Mutations at one site, V600E and V600K allow RAF to function as a monomer in cells with low RAS activity and as a RAS-dependent dimer in cells with adequate RAS activity. In tumors expressing any of these mutants, RAF/MEK/ERK activity is elevated despite feedback inhibition of RAS. Currently available RAF inhibitors bind to one protomer of the RAF dimer and cause negative cooperativity of binding to the second site. This is sometimes associated with transactivation of the unbound protomer. These inhibitors cannot be used to inhibit ERK signaling in tumors in which ERK is driven by RAF-dimers (those with mutant RAS, NF1 loss, atypical RAF mutations, RAF translocations.) In contrast, in tumors with V600E BRAF mutations, ERK causes strong feedback inhibition of RAS and V600E BRAF exists as a monomer that is inhibited by these drugs. Acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors usually results from a molecular lesion that causes RAS-dependent or independent dimerization of V600E (NRAS mutation, V600E BRAF amplification, V600E aberrantly spliced isoform.) Current RAF inhibitors inhibit V600E BRAF dimers at concentrations 10-100 fold greater than those required to inhibit the corresponding monomer in cells. We take this as a provisional measure of the degree of negative cooperativity of binding to the second site. We have now identified inhibitors that inhibit V600E dimers at concentrations close (1-3 fold higher) than those required to inhibit the monomer. They do not cause dissociation of dimers and their inhibition is abolished by gatekeeper mutations. Phenotypically, therefore, binding of these compounds to dimers is associated with only minimal negative cooperativity. These drugs inhibit ERK signaling and the proliferation of tumor cells with atypical BRAF mutations and translocations as well as V600E melanoma models with acquired resistance to Vemurafenib. However, they are much less active in cancer cells with KRAS mutation or receptor-dependent activation of RAF. Selective inhibitors of subsets of RAF dimers may allow effective ERK inhibition of large subset of tumors without inhibiting signaling in normal cells.']",

        "Background":"['BACKGROUND. In contrast to the majority of human tumors which harbour p53 mutations, melanomas preferentially have BRAF V600E or NRAS(Q61K) mutations accompanied by dysfunction of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which may help progression from nevi to invasive melanoma. Although ultraviolet radiation accelerates BRAF-driven melanomagenesis by targeting TP53 (Viros A. et al, Nature. 2014;511', '478-82), some evidences for an anomalous wt p53 response to radiation in melanomas are a dysfunctional pro-apoptotic DNA damage response which can be enhanced by radiation sensitizers like halogenated pyrimidines (Rieber M, Rieber MS.Cancer Biol Ther. 2008;7', '1561-6), and a report that p53 knockdown in melanoma cells resulted in decreased proliferation (Avery-Kiejda KA1, Bowden NA, Croft AJ, Scurr LL, Kairupan CF, Ashton KA, Talseth-Palmer BA, Rizos H, Zhang XD, Scott RJ, Hersey P.BMC Cancer. 2011;11', '203) .PURPOSE. Since activation of AMPK by AMP inhibits ATP-consuming metabolic pathways during metabolic stress which may cause autophagy, we investigated the possible role of melanoma p53 status in modulating response to AMPK activators and autophagy inhibitors, in physiological 5mM glucose. EXPERIMENTAL. Genetically-matched NRAS-mutant human melanoma cells with unequal p53 mutational status were exposed to different glucose levels in the presence of AMPK inducers including autophagy modulators. Formation of autophagic vesicles were quantitated by cytometric red/gree acridine orange fluorescence Apoptosis-associated PARP cleavage was studied by specific immune blotting. RESULTS. AMPK induction in response to AICAR was greater than that of metformin and was increased in mutant p53 cells, which also showed greater resistance to autophagy inhibition. Greater AMPK activation correlated with increased lysosomal acidification in mutant p53 cells. CONCLUSIONS. Our results identify a role for a) p53 dysfunction in enhancing the response to AMPK activators and autophagy to favour tumor cell survival, b) autophagy inhibitors in counteracting pro-survival AMPK signaling.']",

        "Background":"['Most of melanoma harbour mutations leading to the constitutive activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (i.e', ' activating mutations of BRAF, NRAS, c-KIT). Addiction of melanoma to the MAPK pathways led to the development of inhibitors targeting either mutant BRAF, such as Vemurafenib (PLX4032), or MEK. Melanoma treatment recently met a breakthrough with the clinical evaluation of Vemurafenib that demonstrated an unprecedented 80% response rate among patients with BRAF V600E melanomas treated with Vemurafenib, but rapidly limited by drug resistance, which still requires to be elucidated.The MAPK pathway regulates the expression of many genes which can mediate therapeutic response but also resistance, such as RhoGTPases. We analysed the mRNA expression of the RhoGTPases in two BRAF mutated melanoma cell lines, WM266-4 and A375, in response to inhibition of the MAPK pathway by PLX4032. We observed that the mRNA of RhoB was increased by PLX4032 treatment. This result was confirmed in many other BRAF mutated melanoma cell lines by inhibition of the MAPK pathway with BRAF inhibitors (PLX4032 or SB-590885) as well as MEK inhibitors (AZD6244 or AS703026). MEK inhibitors (AZD6244 or AS703026) upregulate RhoB in BRAF wild-type melanoma cells harbouring N-Ras, K-Ras or c-KIT mutation suggesting that inhibiting MAPK pathway is critical for RhoB expression modulation. It is noteworthy that this modulation is cell type dependent, while it was not found in BRAF mutated non-melanoma cells as colon carcinoma cells (Colo205 and RKO).To investigate the role of RhoB induction in cellular responses to BRAF and MEK inhibitors, the RhoB induction was suppressed using RNA interference. The cells treated with siRNA targeting RhoB, WM266-4 and A375 cells, were more sensitive to PLX4032 and AZD6244. Moreover the blockade of RhoB induction led to a significant increase of PLX4032-induced apoptosis as shown by the increase of the subG1 population and PARP cleavage.Our findings show that RhoB upregulation is involved in PLX4032 response and both inhibitions of MAPK pathway and RhoB expression trigger cell death and should prompt a search for agents. Indeed co-targeting MAPK and RhoB pathways, could lead to a synthetic lethality and prevent resistance to either BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Ongoing work focuses on confirming this role in tumour-xenografted mouse models.']",

        "Background":"['Desmoplastic melanomas (DMs) comprise 4% of the overall melanoma burden and have a 5-year survival rate of 85%. DMs are dermal tumors characterized by spindled melanocytes situated within abundant desomplastic stroma. These unusual histological features commonly lead to misdiagnosis. Currently, there are no known genetic drivers. A better understanding of the underlying biology of desmoplastic melanoma would provide biomarkers and therapeutic opportunities. Towards this goal, we performed low-coverage genome and high-coverage exome sequencing of 20 DMs in a discovery cohort, followed by targeted sequencing of 293 candidate genes on a validation cohort of 42 cases. Additionally, high-resolution aCGH was performed on samples from both cohorts. A high mutation burden (median 62 mutations/Mb) ranked desmoplastic melanoma among the most highly mutated cancers sequenced to date. Mutation patterns strongly indicate that UV-radiation is the dominant mutagen and implicate a superficially located cell of origin despite their predominantly intradermal presentation. Novel alterations included recurrent promoter mutations and amplification of NF-kappa B inhibitor epsilon, NFKBIE (IkB) in 14.5% of samples. The promoter mutations typically affect both alleles and occur over a highly conserved DNA region. The mutations are predicted to disrupt a canonical Ets Like Factor 1 (ELF1) binding site. In total, these data imply aberrant NF-kappa B signaling as a pathogenic feature of desmoplastic melanoma. Commonly mutated oncogenes in melanomas, in particular BRAF V600E and NRAS Q61K/R, were absent. Instead, other genetic alterations known to activate the MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades were identified in 73% of samples, affecting NF1, CBL, ERBB2, MAP2K1, MAP3K1, BRAF, EGFR, PTPN11, MET, RAC1, SOS2, NRAS, and PIK3CA. Rb and p53 pathway alterations occurred respectively in 71% and 66% of tumors, affecting RB1, FBXW7, CDK4, PPP6C, CCND1, CDKN2A, TP53, and MDM2. Finally, TERT promoter mutations or amplifications occurred in 90% of tumors. The consequences of the mutations on protein expression levels was confirmed by immunostaining for NF1, EGFR, Rb, CDK4, CCND1, p16, p53, and Mdm2. Collectively, many of these oncogenic mutations are potentially druggable. In conclusion, desmoplastic melanomas harbor distinct genetic alterations that explain their unique biology, and this study illuminates genetic biomarkers and nominates targets for therapeutic intervention.']",

Currently, BRAF inhibitors are one of the most promising approaches to treat metastatic melanoma.Methods', ' In this study, we applied mass spectrometry-based SNP genotyping (Sequenom) to detect single nucleotide mutations in 33 cancer-related genes including BRAF, NRAS, KIT, CTNNB1, GNAS, and MET. PCR and extension primers for the multiplexed assay were designed with the Sequenom Assay Design software. Samples were processed as recommended by the manufacturer. Matrix chips were assayed on a Sequenom MassArray MALDI-TOF Mass Array system. Visual inspection and Sequenom Typer software were used to perform genotyping based on mass spectra. We compared two independent melanoma cohorts, one from Ireland (SVUH cohort; n=97) and the other from Belgium (Leuven cohort; n=60).Results', ' Intriguingly, patients from Ireland showed significant lower BRAFV600E mutation rates (19.0%) when compared to the mutation frequency seen with the Belgian cohort (43.3%) or with the mutation frequency reported by other studies on non-Irish populations (50-70%).

Although the number of NRASQ61 mutant cases was slightly higher among the Irish melanoma patients compared with Belgium patients (20.6% and 13.3%, respectively), this does not fully account for the difference in BRAFV600E mutation rate. In contrast, many BRAFV600 WT patients in the SVUH cohort carried significantly increased mutation rates in MET (11.4%) compared to the Leuven cohort (0%) and reported elsewhere (2%). c-MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that activates multiple signal transduction pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, WNT, and Notch. MET inhibitors that are currently in clinical trials include cabozantinib and foretinib and might be a valuable alternative treatment strategy for patients exhibiting this mutation. Mutation rates of the other examined genes were always <5% and did not significantly differ between the groups.Conclusion', ' Our observation of reduced BRAFV600E mutation rates in Irish patients will directly impact future treatment strategies for these patients.

Limited numbers have made it difficult to determine if the presentation and characteristics of pediatric metastatic melanoma are similar to the disease seen in adults.  Methods', '   In a retrospective chart review, we identified sixteen pediatric patients with metastatic melanoma who were referred to the Pediatric Oncology Branch. Molecular status of tumors was determined by CLIA certified tests.

Results', '   A total of 16 patients aged 2-21yo were evaluated from January 2009 to January 2014. Fifteen patients had cutaneous melanoma and one teen had mucosal melanoma.

BGB-283 is a novel pan-RAF inhibitor and currently under clinical development to treat BRAF and KRAS/NRAS mutated tumors. In this study, we show that BGB-283 inhibits WT B-RAF dimer much more potently than vemurafenib at millimolar ATP concentration that is representative of the cellular ATP level, although BGB-283 and vemurafenib display similar inhibitory activity at the Km ATP concentration. BGB-283 has very slow off-rate and the dissociation half-life (t1/2) on WT B-RAF enzyme is well above 24 hrs. In comparison, vemurafenib has much faster off rates with t1/2 in the range of minutes. The crystal structure of BGB-283/B-RAF protein complex shows the benzimidazole and trifluoro group of BGB-283 binds significantly deeper into pocket formed by -C helix and activation loop than vemurafenib. BGB-283 exhibits time-dependent inhibition both in biochemical assay and in B-RAF or K-RAS mutated cells. BGB-283 potently inhibits the p-ERK signaling in splicing isoform p61B-RAF(V600E) cells which were reported to be resistant to vemurafenib through a dimer mechanism. In vivo, BGB-283 significantly suppressed the tumor growth in A375-p61B-RAF(V600E) melanoma xenograft model. In addition, BGB-283 inhibits vemurafenib induced p-ERK activation and selumetinib induced p-MEK feedback activation in K-RAS mutated cancer cells. In both cases, activation is reported to be mediated by RAF dimers. Taken together, we propose that BGB-283 is a novel, slow-off RAF dimer inhibitor that targets the MAPK signaling differently from the first generation BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib.

We elucidated mutual-exclusive mutations that were from genes in the same or different pathways. Several sets of well-known mutual-exclusive SNVs were verified in our analysis such as BRAF/NRAS SNVs in melanoma. We also illustrated novel sets of mutual-exclusive mutational events, such as IDH1/PTEN/PPP1R3A SNVs in brain tumors and EGFR/FGFR3/GNAS/NOTCH4 CNVs in all cancers.3. SNVs of more than 10 genes were enriched in specific cancer types, such as IDH1 and NF1 in brain tumor, BRAF and MITF in melanoma. CNVs of more than 50 genes were found enriched in one cancer type, such as PDGFRA amplifications in brain tumors and IL6R amplifications in breast cancer. We observed not only expected cancer specific mutations such as BRAF SNVs but also novel mutations such as NF1 SNVs and PDGFRA amplifications.4. We performed mutual-exclusivity and cancer type enrichment analysis on SNV hotspots. More than 20 SNV hotspots were elucidated, such as BRAF(V600E) in melanoma, IDH1(R132H) in brain tumors, KRAS(G12D) in colorectal cancer, and PIK3CA(H1047L) in breast cancer. In addition, multiple SNV hotspots were found to occur mutual-exclusively, such as BRAF(V600E)/IDH1(R132H)/MPL(L532V) in brain tumors.ConclusionDeep target sequencing enables us to systematically determine the potential driver mutation events (including low allele frequency SNVs), which not only help us characterize the landscape of cancer genomic alterations, but also provide comprehensive patient molecular profile to facilitate clinical decision-making and novel clinical trial design.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' A challenge in delivering personalized cancer care to the clinic is identifying tumor genotypes that predict response to targeted therapeutics. Methods', ' In 2008, we established a Personalized Cancer Medicine Registry (PCMR) and began consenting patients for the following', ' 1) prospective genotyping of their cancer; 2) storing their tumor material for future research; and 3) permission to re-contact them if their tumor genotype fits the profile for a new therapeutic. As of the end of 2009, more than 800 patients were enrolled in the PCMR, including cases of colorectal carcinoma (CRC, n = 199), endometrioid carcinoma (EC, n = 95), thyroid carcinoma (TC, n = 276), bladder carcinoma (n = 80), and malignant melanoma (MM, n = 163 ). Tumor DNA from archival tissue was genotyped using a Sequenom MassArray system. Each sample was analyzed using a panel (320 assays) that detects known mutations in 29 genes. Clinical and genotyping data are stored in a web-interfaced, customized SQL database. Results', ' 95% of approached patients consented to registry enrollment. Archival tumor suitable for analysis was obtained in 95% of cases. Mutations in EC include PIK3CA (21%), CTNNB1 (13%), KRAS (11%), FBXW7 (5%), TP53 (5%), AKT1 (4%), FGFR2 (3%), NRAS (1%) and PDGFRA (1%); 14 cases harbor 2 or more mutations. Among cutaneous MM we found mutations in BRAF (47%; 10.8% other than V600E), NRAS (13%), CTNNB1 (3%), PIK3CA (2%), AKT1 (1%) and MEK2 (1%). In CRC we found mutations in KRAS (30%), TP53 (16%), PIK3CA (12%), NRAS / BRAF / FBXW7 (3% each), CTNNB1 (2%), and MEK1 / AKT1 / AKT2 / RET (1% each). Remarkably, 10 of 14 CRC tumors (71%) with a PIK3CA mutation also have a KRAS mutation. In TC, we found mutations of BRAF (63%), RET-PTC (7%), and PIK3CA/KRAS/NRAS/HRAS (1.5% each). Conclusions', ' Prospective tumor genotyping for PCMR patients reveals a remarkable diversity of potentially druggable mutations, knowledge of which will help in clinical trial enrollment. While rare in the examined tumors, mutations in FGFR2, MEK1/2, AKT1/2, PDGFRA and RET could be targeted as part of individualized cancer treatments. In CRC, the common overlap of PIK3CA mutations with KRAS mutations may negatively impact response to inhibitors of the PI3 kinase pathway.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Genetics of melanoma (MM) has greatly progressed in the last decades by the discovery of mutations in BRAF, NRAS and KIT. However, there is a large genetic variability not only of a tumor to another but also depending on the stage of the disease. In order to deepen our knowledge about this and for a purpose referred to therapeutic and prognosis we studied 118 MM tumors and 73 nevi by target next generation sequencing. Methods', ' After extraction, tumor DNA of 118 tumors (44 metastatic tumors, 46 SSM, 11 ALM, 5 nodular, 2 Dubreuilh and 3 spitzoid) and 73 nevi (50 benign nevi, 18 dysplastic nevi and 5 spitzoid nevi) were sequenced using a panel of 15 genes (ALK, BRAF, CDKN2A, CTNNB1, GNA11, GNAQ, KIT, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NRAS, RAC1, RAF1, SF3B1, TERT and TP53) on a new generation sequencer (PGM Ion Torrent) using chips 318 with a depth > 51000x . The analysis of the variants was made by dedicated software (Ion Reporter, wAnnovar) and we selected only those which had a sufficient quality score. Results', ' The results of the sequencing showed the presence of very large number of mutations. In the begnin nevi, excepting BRAF mutations (V600E and V600K, present in 86%) there were no other mutations. At the opposite, the percentage of mutations in many other genes (ALK, KIT,CDKN2A,TP53...) in MM tumors range from 55% (Breslow < 1mm) to 90% in metastatic tumors. More than 80% of mutations were transitions C > T reflecting the UV-induced mutagenesis. Interestingly, in 33% of atypical and Spitz nevi, we also found at least one mutation in one of these genes (40% of these mutations were reported in Cosmic databases). Comparison of the proportion of somatic mutations between the different types of nevi, tumors with low thickness and metastatic tumors clearly showed an accumulation of somatic mutations during tumor development. Conclusions', ' This chip dedicated to MM is interesting', ' high sensitivity, allowing a better tumor classification and rapid identification of therapeutic targets. In addition, it could help for MM diagnosis in case of pigmented lesions with atypical component or uncertain diagnosis. In a second step, this panel of markers will be used to detect circulating tumor DNA in plasma of patients and to correlate their presence with melanoma prognosis.']",

        "Background":"['Previously our group reported the identification of metabotropic glutamate receptor (GRM1) as an oncogene and as a potential therapeutic target of melanoma. We reported two clinical trials of Riluzole, an FDA approved glutamate release inhibitor for ALS, in advanced melanoma patients that showed suppression of PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway and demonstrated clinical response of 34%. Recently, our lab found that over expression of GRM1 in a low GRM1-expressing melanoma cell line UACC903 GRM1+, BRAFV600E, PTENMUT, stimulates angiogenesis through activating the signaling pathway of AKT-mTOR-HIF1-IL8, VEGF even under the normoxia condition. We also demonstrated that Riluzole inhibits angiogenesis through the signaling pathway of GRM1/AKT/HIF1 among the patients responding to Riluzole in our phase II clinical trial. To facilitate translating the discovery of GRM1 stimulating angiogenesis into clinic, we designed an in vitro pre-clinical study assessing the combinatory effects of Riluzole with the agents targeting the angiogenesis pathway of GRM1.We tested an AKT inhibitor, MK-2206 and a HIF1 inhibitor, Aminoflavone, the active component of AFP464, which is in Phase I clinical trial and a ligand probably activating the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in hypoxia preventing angiogenesis, even though it is reported that Aminoflavone also works in an AhR-independent fashion reducing HIF-1alpha in certain cell lines. Five melanoma cell lines UACC903GRM1 +,BRAFV600E,PTENMUT, SKMel2GRM1+,NRASQ61R,PTENWT,C8161GRM1+,BRAF/NRAS/PTENWT,A2058GRM1+,BRAFV600E,HT144GRM1+,BRAFV600E,PTENMUT were tested for HIF1 expression. HT-144, a BRAF mutant that is a V600E homozygous line which is particularly aggressive, showed highest expression of HIF1 alpha through western blotting. The AKT inhibitor and the HIF1 alpha inhibitor were tested alone and in combination with Riluzole in HT-144 cell line. Cell proliferation response to the treatments was assessed through MTS assays. HIF-1 and pAKT inhibition was assessed through Western Blots and relative mRNA level of HIF1 and IL-8 was quantified using qRT-PCR.The monolayer growth assays demonstrated significant inhibition of growth with combination treatments versus single treatments at hypothesized clinically beneficial dosage. Also, MK-2206 and Aminoflavone when combined with Riluzole led to larger decrease in HIF and pAKT levels relative to DMSO treated cells at protein level. HT144 cells also demonstrated angiogenesis signaling response to the combination treatment of Riluzole with MK-2206 or Aminoflavone, which was observed by the significant inhibition of IL8 and Hif 1 at mRNA level. We conclude that HIF1 interacts with GRM1 in stimulating angiogenesis and the combination of glutamate release inhibitor with the agents targeting the downstream signaling of GRM1 could provide a better clinical outcome for melanoma patients as compared to single agent Riluzole.']",
