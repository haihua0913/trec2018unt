But there have been few reports about molecular profiling of small cell lung cancers (SCLC). We conducted the Shizuoka Lung Cancer Mutation Study to analyze driver mutations in patients with thoracic SCLC malignancies.  Methods', '  We collected molecular profiling data of SCLC from the biobanking system in conjunction with the clinic, including the pathology lab, where 23 mutations in 9 genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, NRAS, MEK1, AKT1, PTEN and HER2), EGFR, MET, PIK3CA, FGFR1 and FGFR2 amplifications, and EML4-ALK translocations were assessed using pyrosequensing plus capillary electrophoresis, qRT-PCR, and RT-PCR, respectively. To evaluate mutation status for SCLC patients, we collected patient characteristics data from medical records. Results', '  Between July 2011 and July 2012, fifty small cell lung cancer patients were assessed in our biobanking system. Patient characteristics were as follows', ' median age (range) 70 (43 - 82) years; male 82%; smoker 96%; limited disease/extended disease 56/44%; small cell carcinoma/combined small cell carcinoma with adenocarcinoma 94/6%; surgically resected snap-frozen samples 8, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples 40 and pleural effusion 7. We detected driver mutations in 8 cases (16%). Mutations found', ' EGFR 1 (2%), KRAS 1 (2%), PIK3CA 2 (4%), AKT1 1 (2%), MET amplification 1 (2%), PIK3CA amplification 6 (12%). EGFR and KRAS mutation were found in combined small cell carcinoma with adenocarcinoma. No significant differences in age, sex, disease extent at diagnosis or smoking status were found between patients with mutations and those without mutations. But serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels were significantly higher in patients without mutations (p=0.03).  Conclusions', '  In our analysis, driver mutations were found in 16% of SCLC patients and PIK3CA amplification seemed to be relatively frequent in SCLC. Our results suggest that PIK3CA might become a target of treatment for SCLC patients.']",

        "Background":"['Background', '  Amplification of the ERBB2 (HER2) gene is a well-known genetic aberration in many tumor entities. Up to 20% of breast and gastric cancer show ERBB2 gene amplification and anti-HER2 targeting therapies are well established for these tumors. In other tumor entities such as lung cancer, colorectal cancer and bladder cancer the fraction of ERBB2 amplified tumors is considerably lower. In contrast to breast cancer, these tumors show heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification in a substantial proportion. Oncogenic EGFR mutation with subsequent EGFR amplification is a common phenomenon in lung cancer. In analogy, primary ERBB2 mutation could explain the observed heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification in some tumors. Methods', '  100 tumors showing ERBB2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization were examined for ERBB2 mutation', ' 50 breast cancer samples, including 10 cases with borderline gene amplification, 10 cases with heterogeneous gene amplification and 11 samples of metastatic lesions as well as 15 colorectal carcinomas, 12 gastric carcinomas, 12 non-small cell lung cancers and 10 urothelial carcinomas. Tumor DNA was extracted and examined for mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (exons 18-23) of the ERBB2 gene by Sanger sequencing. Results', '  ERBB2 mutation was found in two metastatic lesions of breast cancer, two lung cancers and two colorectal cancers. In five of these cases short in-frame insertions in exon 20 were found. In one case of a breast cancer lung metastasis a missense mutation in exon 19 (p.L755S) was detected. The semi-quantitative chromatograms show an overrepresentation of the mutations indicating a selective amplification of the mutated allele. Conclusions', '  In certain tumor entities the heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification indicates a late genetic event. The finding of a concomitant mutation in ERBB2 amplified tumors might explain the heterogeneity in some of these tumors. The effect of a primary oncogenic ERBB2 mutation might be increased by selective amplification of the mutated allele resulting in an additional growth advantage. If ERBB2 amplified tumors with a primary ERBB2 mutation also benefit from an HER2 targeted therapy needs to be elucidated.']",

With attention to the direct connection between the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of tumor cells and the pharmacological effects of specific inhibitors, we systematically assessed the RTK expressions of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung (HGNEC), including SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC).Patients and Methods', 'Fifty-one LCNEC and 61 SCLC patients who underwent surgical resection were enrolled in this research. As a control group, 202 patients with adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 122 patients with squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs) were also analyzed. Using immunohistochemical staining (IHC), we stained all tumors with antibodies for 10 RTKs; c-Kit, EGFR, IGF1R, KDR, ERBB2, FGFR1, c-Met, ALK, RET and ROS1. We scored the expression of these RTKs for all enrolled tumors, and compared them according to the histological types.Results', 'The LCNEC and SCLC patients exhibited similar clinicopathological characteristics. The IHC scores for each RTK were almost equivalent between the LCNEC and SCLC groups, but they were significantly different from those of the ADC or SQCC groups. Especially, c-Kit was the only RTK that was remarkably expressed in both LCNECs and SCLCs. On the other hand, about 20% of the HGNEC tumors exhibited strongly positive RTK expression, and this rate was similar to those for the ADC and SQCC tumors. Intriguingly, strongly positive RTKs were almost mutually exclusive in individual tumors.Conclusions', 'Compared with ADC or SQCC, LCNEC and SCLC had similar expression profiles for the major RTKs. The exclusive c-Kit positivity observed among HGNECs suggested that c-Kit might be a distinctive RTK in HGNEC. These HGNECs which have strongly positive RTKs could be the targets of personalized therapies.']",

SCLC shows distinct molecular and clinical features when compared to other lung cancer subtypes. Previous analyses by us and others have identified genomic and proteomic differences between SCLC and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Epigenetic alterations are some of the earliest events that could also lead to oncogenic changes and thus play an essential role in tumor initiation and progression. However, epigenetic differences between SCLC and NSCLC contributing to the alterations in gene and protein expression patterns, distinct biological features and therapeutic response have not been well characterized. Here, we investigate the differences in the methylation patterns of SCLC and NSCLC to provide novel insights into epigenetic associated gene alterations to identify potential therapeutic targets in SCLC.Material and Methods', ' A genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of SCLC and NSCLC cell lines was used for this investigation. We correlated DNA methylation status with gene expression and protein expression levels in 31 SCLC and 73 NSCLC lines to identify the relationship of epigenetic with genomic and proteomic features distinguishing SCLC from NSCLC.Results', ' SCLC and NSCLC lines exhibited different methylation profiles and we identified 484 genes that had a significant inverse correlation between methylation status and mRNA expression levels (Rho  -0.5 and FDR = 0.01), (genes regulated by methylation, GRM) that distinguished SCLC from NSCLC. Ingenuity pathway analysis of the 484 genes identified significant associations with neuregulin signaling, immune trafficking, integrin signaling, glioma invasiveness canonical pathways. Proteomic profiling by Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) validated the different expression of some of the 484 genes identifying nine that were hypermethylated and downregulated at protein levels in SCLC compared to NSCLC lines (PTEN, CyclinD1, Caveolin, Notch3, TAZ, HSP27, STAT6 and both total and phosphorylated levels of receptor tyrosine kinases such Her2 and, MET).Conclusions', ' Genome wide methylation, mRNA expression, and detailed proteomic analyses have identified specific epigenic differences between SCLC and NSCLC that impact on important signaling pathways including widespread loss of PTEN function and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) expression in SCLCs which need to be considered in developing new rationale therapies for SCLC.']",

        "Background":"['Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15% of all lung cancer cases and is a highly lethal disease. For the last several decades, the standard treatment for SCLC has been deadlocked, and new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a member of the HER family and has been reported to be overexpressed in 30% of SCLC cases with poor prognosis. However, the clinical relevance of HER2-targeted therapy for SCLC remains unclear. Here, we firstly identify that cytotoxic drugs induce significant HER2 overexpression through microRNA-125a (miR-125a) and miR-125b downregulation, which in turn act as a novel therapeutic target for trastuzumab-mediated cellular cytotoxicity in SCLC. In this study, we showed that treatment of the HER2-positive SCLC cells, SBC-3 and SBC-5, with cytotoxic drugs induced a significant upregulation of HER2. Cisplatin (CDDP) treatment of SCLC cells resulted in a significant downregulation of miR-125a and miR-125b. We confirmed that miR-125a and miR-125b bound to the 3-untranslated regions of HER2 mRNA, and that downregulation of miR-125a and miR-125b resulted in upregulation of HER2 in SCLC cells, suggesting a relationship between cytotoxic drug exposure and miR-125/HER2 dysregulation. Furthermore, using a calcein assay we demonstrated a significant synergistic cytotoxic effect of CDDP and trastuzumab that was mediated via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Finally, we clearly demonstrated the synergistic anti-tumor effect of these agents in an orthotopic lung cancer model in vivo.

        "Background":"['Detection and chemoprevention of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been unsuccessful in part due to our limited knowledge of the pathogenesis of the disease. It has been suggested that normal airway epithelia share molecular abnormalities with tumors and may serve as progenitors for lung malignancies. We sought to analyze molecular profiles of lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), two major subtypes of NSCLC, and matched normal airways to elucidate aberrant expression patterns in early phases of lung tumorigenesis. All specimens were obtained from primary early stage NSCLC consented patients who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy (n=20). We profiled RNA isolated from tumors and normal lung as well as from brushings of multiple matched airways that were histologically confirmed to lack neoplastic or preneoplastic cells (n=194). Expression signatures signifying genes significantly and concurrently differentially expressed between both tumors and airways compared to normal lung tissue (tumor-airway-normal/TAN signatures) were then derived independently for SCC and smoker adenocarcinoma cases and were comprised of 1,803 and 1,938 genes, respectively. The TAN signatures effectively clustered tumor and airways from normal lung samples (p<0.001). Further analysis showed that a subset of the genes separated SCC- and adenocarcinoma-adjacent airways. Moreover, pathways and gene-network analysis using Ingenuity pathways software highlighted similarities and differences in pathway modulation between airway epithelial fields of SCCs and adenocarcinomas. Embryonic stem cell and eicosanoid signaling pathways were most significantly modulated among those common to both TAN signatures (p<0.001). Retinoic acid receptor and stem cell signaling pathways mediated by NANOG and lineage oncogene SOX2 were most significantly modulated in the SCC TAN signature, whereas NF-kB and PTEN signaling pathways were most prevalent in the adenocarcinoma TAN airway signature (all p<0.001). Gene networks mediated by lineage oncogene NKX2-1/TITF-1 down-regulation and TP63 up-regulation, and networks mediated by increased expression of the MET and ERBB2 oncogenes were predominantly functionally modulated in the SCC and adenocarcinoma TAN signatures, respectively. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed up-regulation of MET in adenocarcinomas and normal airways compared to normal lung. These findings highlight expression patterns and pathways that are deregulated differentially in the pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinomas and SCCs and thus offer detection markers as well as therapeutic targets to guide personalized chemoprevention in early stage NSCLC patients.

However, treatment-related toxicities, particularly gastrointestinal adverse events, have limited clinical development of this class of agents. The development of efficacy biomarkers to gamma-secretase inhibitors and antibodies to Notch ligands and receptors could speed clinical testing. Mutations in Notch1, a dominant Notch receptor, are rare in human solid tumors, and clinical activity has not been observed in patients with tumors bearing Notch1 activating mutations, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia from available clinical data. Identification of tumors with abundant target expression and/or active Notch signaling status characteristic of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) expression by immunohistochemistry may have clinical utility. All levels of tumor Notch1 expression comprised of low, moderate and high detected by immunohistochemistry and quantitated by digital imaging technology were observed in 52% (34/66) of lung cancers, 51% (35/68) of ovarian cancers, and 11% (7/63) of breast cancers (lung or ovary vs. breast, P<0.0001 by 2-sided Fisher Exact Test). Notch1 was expressed at high levels in 20% of lung cancers including sarcoma, neuroendocrine, small cell and undifferentiated carcinomas, as well as adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinomas. High expression of Notch1 was observed in 9% of ovarian tumors including undifferentiated carcinoma, serous adenocarcinoma, and endometrioid adenocarcinoma. In breast cancer, it was noted in one case of infiltrating ductal carcinoma with triple-negative phenotype. Expression of high-level Notch1 varies in lung cancer vs. ovarian cancer vs. breast cancer (P=0.002 by Chi-square statistic), and was frequently associated with NICD expression. Notch1 was not significantly associated with estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor or HER2 status in breast cancer. These data suggest that the frequency of all levels of Notch1 expression is significantly higher in lung cancer and ovarian cancer than breast cancer; and high-level Notch1 is more frequent in lung cancer than in ovarian cancer, and, likewise, more frequent in ovarian cancer than in breast cancer. For the first time, expression of Notch1/NICD has been identified in undifferentiated carcinomas.

Methods', ' Molecular profiling using a panel of gene 24 genes was performed by next generation sequencing (NGS) on 158 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 42 colorectal cancers. The genes studied included ERBB2, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, SRC, JAK3, ERBB4, ERBB2, and SMAD4. In addition, these tumors were studied for the expression of PD-L1 using immunohistochemistry (IHC). PD-L1 expression was performed using standard IHC approach using SP142 clone (Spring Biosciences). Results', ' The level of PD-L1 expression was significantly (P = 0.0005) lower in colorectal cancer as compared with NSCLC. The NSCLC cohort had significantly (P = < 0.0001) more cases with 3 or more genes mutated as compared with colorectal cancer. However, there was no significant difference in TP53 mutation frequency between the two tumor types. There was no correlation between PD-L1 expression and the presence or absence of 3 or more gene mutations in either NSCLC or colorectal cancer. However, PD-L1 expression was significantly (P = 0.01) higher in tumors with TP53 mutation in the NSCLC cohort, but not in the colorectal carcinoma cohort (P = 0.5). This was true whether PD-L1 level was used as a continuous variable or if it was dichotomized at 20% (P = 0.02) or 40% (P = 0.03) cutoffs.

More importantly, TP53 mutation in NSCLC correlates with the expression of PD-L1 protein, but not in colorectal cancer despite similar rate of mutation of the TP53 between the two tumor types.

Furthermore, we examined anti-tumor activity of afatinib and gefitinib in several NSCLC cell lines, and investigated the association between their genetic alteration and sensitivity to afatinib treatment.

We hypothesized that CGP could also potentially identify a TOO for some CUP patients, further refining potential targeted therapeutic options. Methods', ' DNA alterations from 44,065 samples that underwent CGP as part of standard clinical care were classified using logistic regression based on mutational profiles and select clinical features. Results', ' We first trained a logistic regression classifier to identify non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) with alterations in EGFR, ERBB2, BRAF, MET, KRAS, ALK, RET, or ROS1 (lung gene set).

Aberrant activation of HER3 as a result of HER2 amplification or neuregulin 1 (NRG1) over-expression has been demonstrated to mediate constitutive activation of downstream oncogenic signals. LJM716 is a fully human IgG1 anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody. It locks HER3 in an inactive conformation and prevents HER3 dimerization with other ErbB family members. This unique mode of action enables LJM716 to block both ligand dependent and ligand independent HER3 activation. In search of new indications that may benefit from anti-HER3 therapies, we noted that squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) tend to have relatively higher NRG1 expression as compared to their adenocarcinoma counterparts. Highest NRG1 expression was observed in the lung SCC cell lines in cell line encyclopedia (CLE). A subset of the lung SCC cell lines with high NRG1 expression are moderately sensitive to LJM716, with HER3 activation detected in all of the sensitive lines. Additionally, EGFR activation is consistently observed in our panel of squamous lung carcinoma models. In some cases, activation of HER2 and/or HER3 is also noted. We hypothesize that squamous lung carcinomas may be dependent on signaling through EGFR, HER2 and HER3. To completely block EGFR, HER2-HER3 signaling, we set to test the treatment of LJM716 and Cetixumab in a number of NGR 1 positive squamous lung carcinomas tumor models. Enhanced anti tumor activity of LJM716 and Cetixumab is observed in four out nine tumor models. Analysis of broad activation status of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) reveals that a subset of responsive models have activated pEGFR, pHER2 and pHER3.

        "Background":"['Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 15% of primary lung cancer and has the poorest outcome of all its histological types. One of the major reasons of extreme aggressiveness of SCLC is that it recurs shortly after initial therapy with multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. However, standard therapeutic strategy for relapsed-SCLC has not been established yet. As one of the targetable receptor tyrosine kinases, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was reported to be a negative prognostic factor in extensive-disease SCLC (Micke et al. Int J Cancer. 2001;92', '474-9). We found that HER2 was more frequently overexpressed in SCLC cell lines of Japanese origin (6/10) compared to those of Caucasian origin (0/3). We also detected HER2 expression in SCLC tissues in 7 out of 25 patients tested by our highly sensitive immunohistochemistry system. Moreover, we found that HER2 was upregulated when HER2-positive SCLC cells acquired MDR. Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against HER2, exerted differential levels of killing effect on HER2-positive parental and chemoresistant SCLC cells only when Fc receptor-positive natural killer (NK) cells coexisted. This result suggests that trastuzumab-induced SCLC cell-killing effect was caused mainly via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) but not via direct inhibition of HER2 signal. Among these cell lines, etoposide-resistant SCLC cells were most susceptible to trastuzumab in vitro and in vivo, and the antitumor effects of trastuzumab were not only dependent on the amount of HER2 expression on SCLC cells. We focused on cell-cell contact between SCLC cells and NK cells to determine the molecule affecting trastuzumab-mediated ADCC other than HER2. We found that intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 was abundantly expressed on etoposide-resistant SCLC cells, and trastuzumab-mediated ADCC was canceled in the presence of an ICAM-1 functional blocking antibody. These results indicate that ICAM-1 expression on SCLC cell surface is indispensable to augment trastuzumab-mediated ADCC. Thus, trastuzumab could overcome etoposide-resistance in SCLC. On the contrary, irinotecan-resistant SCLC cells were still refractory to trastuzumab. The reason for this was thought that they not only lacked ICAM-1 expression but also came to produce abundant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF, treatment could significantly inhibit the in vivo growth of irinotecan-resistant xenografts through decreasing microvesseles in mice. These results suggest that bevacizumab-mediated antiangiogenesis is a promising therapeutic strategy to salvage irinotecan-resistance.Collectively, targeting stepwise HER2 and VEGF could overcome MDR in SCLC and bring about a favorable outcome for patients with relapsed-SCLC.']",

Overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters is important for the multidrug resistance. Among them, ABCB1 and ABCG2 are known to be upregulated in chemoresistant SCLC. We found that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression is also upregulated in chemoresistant SBC-3/ETP, SBC-3/SN-38 and SBC-3/CDDP cells, compared to chemosensitive SBC-3 cells. Lapatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of HER2, could not suppress proliferation of these HER2-positive SCLC cells, but successfully restored chemosensitivity to etoposide and SN-38 in SBC-3/ETP and SBC-3/SN-38 cells, respectively. The reversal effect of lapatinib was thought to be caused by inhibition of drug efflux-pump functions of ABC transporters, and was producible with a clinically applicable concentration. Moreover, knocking down of HER2 by a small interfering RNA weakened the effect of lapatinib on ABCB1, indicating the involvement of HER2 in the inhibitory mechanisms. Notably, we demonstrated that caveolin-1 and Src play key roles in modulating ABCB1 function via HER2 inactivation. In SBC-3/ETP cells, dephosphorylation of HER2 by lapatinib activates Src and successively leads to increase caveolin-1 phosphorylation. Through this process, caveolin-1 dissociates from HER2 and strengthens association with ABCB1, and finally impairs the pump functions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that treatment by lapatinib in combination with etoposide or irinotecan significantly suppresses the growth of subcutaneous SBC-3/ETP and SBC-3/SN-38 tumors in mice, respectively.

        "Background":"['HER2 is modified in approximately 20% of lung cancers and is mutated in approximately 2-3% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several HER2 mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain are activating mutations, and irreversible EGFR TKIs such as afatinib are known to be effective at inhibiting HER2 phosphorylation in tumor cells expressing HER2 activating mutations. However, the clinical use of these second generation irreversible EGFR inhibitors, such as afatinib, has been limited by adverse toxicities such as skin rash and diarrhea. Our recent study in lung cancer showed that ibrutinib, a well-tolerated TKI currently FDA approved for B-cell lymphoma, is capable of inhibiting EGFR. Study by others also demonstrated that ibrutinib can inhibit HER2 phosphorylation in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cell lines. In addition, recent studies in other cancers show that the effects of ibrutinib can be amplified in combination of with other small molecule inhibitors targeting AKT and mTOR. Therefore, we hypothesized that HER2 overexpression or activating mutations render NSCLC tumor cells sensitive to ibrutinib. To investigate this, we generated a panel of Ba/F3 cell lines expressing twelve individual clinically observed HER2 mutations and evaluated the transforming capability of the mutations as indicated by sustained cell viability following IL-3 deprivation. Common HER2 mutations such as A775insYVMA, G776del/insVV, and G776C V777insC as well as others were observed to be activating mutations. Mutant HER2 expressing Ba/F3 cells and the human HER2 mutant NSCLC cell line, H1781, were then screened against first, second, and third generation EGFR/HER2 inhibitors including ibrutinib, and cell viability was determined by the Cell Titer Glo assay. Drugs effective in growth inhibition were verified by Western blot analysis. The results showed that EGFR TKI erlotinib and the EGFR/HER2 TKI lapatinib failed to inhibit cell proliferation. However, ibrutinib and third generation EGFR/HER2 TKIs, EGF816 and AZD9291, inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis at sub-micromolar concentrations. Western blotting analysis showed dose dependent decreases in phosphorylation of HER2 as well as HER2 downstream signaling molecules such as p-AKT, and p-MAPK. In order to determine if targeting downstream effectors of HER2 in combination with inhibition of the receptor would increase inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis, we screened ibrutinib, EGF816 and AZD9291 in combination with both mTOR and AKT inhibitors. There was a modest additive effect when ibrutinib was used in combination with everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, but there was no additive effect of EGF816 or AZD9291 was used in combination with everolimus. These results indicate that EGF816, AZD9291, or ibrutinib alone or in combination with mTOR inhibition may be effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HER2-driven NSCLC.']",

Methods', '  35 consecutively resected lung cancer patients with multiple lung GGNs  at a single institution (Tongji University, Shanghai, China) were analyzed for mutations in EGFR, KRAS, HER2, BRAF and PIK3CA together with genes fusion in ALK, ROS1 and RET.  Results', '  The median age was 60 years old, male/female', '12/23, never smoker/smoker', ' 25/10, PS 0/1', ' 22/13. Totally, 72 lesions were included into this analysis, including 9 of adenocarcinoma in situ, 9 minimal invasive adenocarcinoma and 54 invasive adenocarcinoma.

        "Background":"['Genes encoding the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR/ERBB1, ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4) are key regulators of cellular proliferation, survival, and differentiation, and thus represent potent proto-oncogenes. In particular, mutations or copy number variations of EGFR or ERBB2 are present in human malignancies and serve as predictive markers for targeted therapies. Recent efforts to comprehensively characterize the mutational landscape of human cancers have identified frequent somatic mutations in ERBB4 in various cancer types, such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and colorectal cancer. However, the significance of mutated ERBB4 in cancer remains elusive.Here, we have functionally characterized nine ERBB4 mutations previously identified in lung adenocarcinoma. Four out of the nine mutations, Y285C, D595V, D931Y and K935I, were found to be activating, increasing both basal and ligand-induced ErbB4 phosphorylation. According to structural analysis, the four activating mutations were located at critical positions at the dimerization interfaces of the ErbB4 extracellular (Y285C, D595V) and kinase (D931Y and K935I) domains. Consistently, the mutations enhanced ErbB4 dimerization and increased the trans activation in ErbB4 homodimers and ErbB4/ErbB2 heterodimers. The expression of the activating ERBB4 mutants promoted survival of NIH 3T3 cells in the absence of serum. Interestingly, serum starvation of NIH 3T3 cells expressing the ERBB4 mutants only moderately increased the phosphorylation of canonical ErbB signaling pathway effectors Erk1/2 and Akt as compared to wild-type ERBB4. In contrast, the mutations clearly enhanced the proteolytic release of signaling-competent ErbB4 intracellular domain.These results suggest the presence of activating, oncogenic mutations of ERBB4 in non-small cell lung cancer.']",

        "Background":"['The development of targeted therapies that efficiently inhibit cancer signaling pathways is one of the main goals of modern precision cancer medicine. Consequently, genetic and biological phenotypic data of in vitro screens are increasingly utilized to develop compounds directed against distinct oncogenic alterations. However, current targeted therapies are often limited to small genetically defined patient cohorts due to the very finite number of proteins amenable to direct chemical inhibition. An alternative approach is the exploitation of synthetic lethality, i.e. inhibition of an unaltered protein required for cell viability in a certain genetic background. Systematic chemo-genomic analyses of cancer cell lines have been shown to be suitable tools for the identification of novel synthetic lethal dependencies in cancer (Chan et al. Sci Trans Med, 2011; Sos et al. PNAS, 2012; Kim et al. Cell 2013).To systematically extend this strategy to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) we characterized the efficacy of 1505 chemical compounds based on a variety of kinase inhibitor motifs in a high-throughput screen against 80 NSCLC cell lines. We extracted patterns of biological activity based on chemical and genetic information and found that potency and selectivity of compounds are strongly related to their molecular scaffold, but independent of their overall chemical complexity. We thereby discovered a sunitinib derivative that exhibited exquisite activity against ERBB2-mutant cell lines but was devoid of ERBB2 kinase activity. Instead a kinome scan and an shRNA screen suggested a mechanism of synthetic lethality by activity against NTRK family members. Moreover a CDK9 inhibitor was identified as selective and potent against a midline carcinoma cell line - a tumor entity characterized by recurrent BRD4-NUT gene fusions. Using additional cell lines we validated the upregulation of c-Fos and selective induction of apoptosis in BRD4-NUT positive midline carcinoma compared to control cell lines following CDK9 inhibition. This can augment existing therapeutic approaches, which have primarily focused on directly targeting the fusion product with bromodomain inhibitors, and offers a novel target in this entity.In conclusion, by systematically screening a large number of compounds against a panel of genetically well characterized NSCLC cell lines and incorporating chemical information we were able to derive structure activity relationships and to identify potential synthetically lethal targets in two genetic entities in clinical need of advanced selective therapies.']",

        "Background":"['ERBB3 is widely expressed in human carcinomas, and its over expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with various carcinomas, (i.e., breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, and head and neck cancers). The presence of ERBB3 correlates with local to distal metastasis in lung, gastric, and colorectal cancers as well as bone invasion in prostate cancer. Activation of ERBB3 is also implicated in the development of resistance to current cancer treatments. Due to its lack of kinase activity, the activation of the ERBB3 receptor is dependent on heterodimerization with active receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The recruitment of ERBB3 into active, heterodimer complexes is mediated by its ligand Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) or by amplified, over expressed RTKs in a ligand independent manner. Therefore, ERBB3 can crosstalk with most major receptors involved in cancer development and maintenance such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and c-MET. AV-203 is a potent, humanized anti-ERBB3 antibody that inhibits both ligand-dependent and independent activation of ERBB3 both in vitro and in vivo. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AV-203 were characterized in mice using the A549 non-small cell lung cancer xenograft model. AV-203 administered IV in mice exhibits acceptable pharmacokinetics supporting preclinical efficacy studies. AV-203 administered IV in A549 NSCLC xenograft tumor bearing mice had lower serum AUC than nave mice, demonstrating that the presence of human ErbB3 may alter the PK parameters of AV-203. In evaluating pharmacodynamics in vivo, AV-203 was able to down regulate total ERBB3 and ERBB3 signaling in A549 tumors in a time-dependent manner. Inhibition of ERBB3 signaling correlated with significant dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in the A549 xenograft model. Dose scheduling studies with the constant AV-203 dose of 2.5 mg/kg revealed that the most efficacious schedule is the more frequent dosing at Q3D. In comparing the total dose of 10 mg/kg per 14 day cycle, at varying dose per injection and frequency, AV-203 resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition at all dose schedules. These data conclude that the efficacy of AV-203 is driven by total drug exposure and that AV-203 is not dependent on Cmax for its antitumor activity.']",

Lung and breast are the most common type of CNS metastasis, representing over half of such tumors. The molecular characteristics of these tumors as well as the factors driving cancers to metastasize to the CNS are poorly understood. This is due in part to inaccessibility of clinical samples and a lack of established, well-characterized models. In order to shed light on the molecular biology of these highly heterogeneous tumors and establish resources for preclinical testing, we are working to create both in vivo and in vitro models of CNS metastases originating from lung or breast cancer. We have thus far received surgical specimens from 7 lung and two breast CNS metastases. Of these, one was a spine metastasis and 6 were brain metastases. Each surgical specimen was used for the generation of patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and cell lines. Of these specimens, we have successfully established continuous cell lines of CNS metastases originating from three lung adenocarcinomas, one squamous lung carcinoma and one ductal breast carcinoma. To verify the presence of metastatic carcinoma cells in culture, cell lines were characterized by immunofluorescence based on staining profiles obtained from each tumor's pathology report. Adenocarcinomas of the lung expressed cytokeratins typical of lung cancer (CK7, 8 and 18), as well as Napsin-A, a highly specific pulmonary marker. The squamous cell carcinoma of the lung expressed these as well as CK5/6 and p63-, pathological markers of squamous differentiation. A metastatic ductal carcinoma of the breast expressed ER, Her2, GATA-3, and Vimentin. For the development of PDX models, tumors were initially implanted into flank of NOG mice and then passaged orthotopically for preclinical testing. Of nine implants, tumor growth was evident for 3 animals harboring adenocarcinoma of the lung, 2 with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, and 1 with breast carcinoma. Samples from metastatic tissue, xenograft tissue and primary tumors (when available) were flow sorted to identify different clonal subpopulations and sequenced for exome and RNA level changes. Genomic characterization of the different clones allowed reconstruction of the evolution of metastasis and identified therapeutically targetable genes.

However, early clinical trials show that response rate of FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (FGFR-TKIs) is 20-30% in patients with FGFR1 amplified lung cancer. To elucidate the reason for de novo resistance to FGFR-TKI, six FGFR1 amplified lung cancer cell lines (NCI-H1581, DMS-114, NCI-H520, NCI-H1703, HCC95, and Calu-3) were analyzed. These cells were confirmed to have FGFR1 amplification by FISH analysis. Cell viability assay showed only 2 of six cell lines, NCI-H1581 and DMS-114, are sensitive to a FGFR-TKI, BGJ-398. Among BGJ-398 insensitive cells, NCI-H1703, HCC95, and Calu-3 cells express low mRNA and protein level of FGFR1 even in the presence of FGFR1 amplification. In addition, while BGJ-398 downregulates ERK phosphorylation in FGFR1 protein expressing cells, the drug had no effect on ERK signaling in BGJ-398 resistant cells with low FGFR1 protein expression. Importantly, other driver oncogenes were found in these BGJ-398 insensitive cell lines. PDGFRa amplification in H1703 cells and HER2 amplification in Calu-3 cells were reported previously. In this study, we have also found ERBB3 ligand NRG1 was overexpressed in HCC95 cells. Knockdown of NRG1 suppressed cell growth and combination of lapatinib with BGJ-398 led to cell death. To further determine whether FGFR1 protein expression is enough for the sensitivity to FGFR-TKIs, lung cancer cell lines were screened to FGFR-TKIs, BGJ-398 and PD-173034. This screen identified that all FGFR-TKI sensitive cell lines harbor FGFR1 amplification with high protein expression. These results suggest FGFR-TKIs should be used to patients harboring both FGFR1 amplification and protein expression. In case tumors with FGFR1 amplification, but expressing low FGFR1 protein, another driver oncogene may coexist and targeting both FGFR1 and these coexisting driver oncogenes are required to treat these tumors.']",

On RPPA, while higher doses of Ganetespib (50-100 nM) completely attenuated the expression of important client growth factor and survival promoting proteins such as EGFR, Her-2, AKT, and mTOR, and enhanced expressed of apoptotic pathways proteins, radiation dose-dependently acted in concert with low dose Ganetespib to upregulate p21 and downregulate pRb levels that were not apparent with either drug or radiation alone. These results suggest that low dose Ganetespib can act as a potent radiosensitizer in the treatment of NSCLC by altering levels of cell cycle progression proteins. Ganetespib in combination with radiotherapy should be explored clinically in LA-NSCLC.']",

        "Background":"[\"Globally, about 53% of lung cancer cases in women and 15% of lung cancer cases in men are not attributable to active tobacco use, making lung cancer in never smokers the seventh leading cause of cancer death. Experimental and epidemiological evidence suggest that lung cancer in never smokers has unique risk factors, clinical features, and histological distributions as compared to those lung cancer cases attributed to tobacco smoking. In general, lung cancer in never smokers presents predominately as adenocarcinoma and in females. The lung cancer rate among females in Xuanwei, China is among the highest in the world for nonsmoking females, and has been attributed to indoor air pollution from domestic fuel combustion, particularly from bituminous coal. To further explore the clinical and histological aspects of lung cancer in Xuanwei, we collected formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from a series of 76 female lung cancer cases. The mean age of the patients was 47.7 years old (9.2 years). Expert consensus review found 54 (71%) of the female lung cancer cases were adenocarcinomas (ADCs), 11 (14.5%) were squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), 1 (1.3%) was an adenosquamous carcinoma (ADSC), 8 (10.5%) were large cell carcinomas, and 2 (2.7%) were other subtypes. We then used two multiplexed assays to detect in DNA from FFPE tissue more than 40 recurrent mutations in nine genes relevant to existing and emerging targeted lung cancer therapies among subjects who were confirmed never smoking female lung cancer cases (32 ADCs, 7 SCCs, 1 ADSC). These assays include amplification of DNA through Applied Biosystem's SNaPshot technology to detect 38 different recurrent somatic point mutations in 8 driver genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, MEK1, AKT1, and PTEN) and a PCR-based sizing assay that assesses for EGFR exon 19 deletions, EGFR exon 20 insertions, and HER2 exon 20 insertions. We detected 15 EGFR mutations [E20-6bp-ins. (n=1); EGFR_19-15bpDel (n=4); EGFR_G719A_2156G>C (n=2); EGFR_G719C_2155G>T (n=3); EGFR_G719S _2155G>T (n=1); EGFR_G719S_2155G>A (n=1); EGFR_L858R_2573T>G (n=2); EGFR L861Q_2582T>A (n=1)] in 12 ADCs and 2 SCCs. Six KRAS mutations, all of which were KRAS G12C_34G>T, were detected in 5 ADCs and 1 SCC. EGFR and KRAS mutations were mutually exclusive and no mutations were observed for BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, MEK1, HER2, AKT1, or PTEN. The high percentage of samples with KRAS mutations (15.0% overall; 15.6% ADCs; 14.3% SCCs) in our series is of interest, primarily because KRAS mutations are reportedly more rare in other populations from Asia (5%) and populations of never smokers from Asia (2%). Given that all subjects with KRAS mutations burned coal indoors for heating and cooking, our findings may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of lung cancer among never smoking females exposed to indoor air pollution from coal.\"]",

        "Background":"['Oncogenic KRAS mutations are found in 40% of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). In order to expand the treatment options for NSCLC harboring oncogenic K-Ras, new therapeutic cell surface targets need to be identified and characterized. Towards this goal we carried out comparative cell surface analysis of the NSCLC cell line H2122-KRASG12C and the BL2122 cell line (i.e., control), which has been established from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of the same NSCLC patient. Here, we describe optimized hydrazide-based glycoproteomics for mapping of the cell surface proteome of the NSCLC H2122 cell line harboring oncogenic KRASG12C. Our comparative glycoproteomics revealed 632 proteins identified by LC-MS at the surface of both H2122-KRASG12C and BL2122 cell lines. Subtractive proteomics revealed 215 proteins detected solely at the H2122-KRASG12C cell surface while 214 proteins were found germane to the cell surface of BL2122 cells. A total of 203 proteins were commonly identified at the surface of both cell lines. Spectral counting based quantitation revealed 44 proteins showing  3-fold increase in their relative concentration at the cell surface of H2122-KRASG12C cells. Subsequent meta-analysis via Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed significant activation of canonical pathways known to be involved in NSCLC biology (e.g., EGFR/neuregulin, and PI3K/AKT signaling). From a subset of proteins showing significant up-regulation at the surface of H2122-KRASG12C cells, we further cross-validated CD147 using immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) and Western blotting (WB). Interestingly, subsequent IFA confirmed the over-expression of CD147 at the cell surface of pancreatic KP-3, lung H2444, and colon SW620 cancer cell lines, each harboring constitutively activated KRAS. Importantly, amongst 215 proteins identified solely at the cell surface of H2122-KRASG12C cells, proteins upstream of K-Ras, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (ERBB2), receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-3 (ERBB3), and disintegrin metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17) were unambiguously identified. Using WB analysis, we first confirmed the expression K-Ras in the membrane preparation of H2122-KRASG12C cells. Interestingly, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, (IGF1R), and mesothelin (MSLN) were also detected exclusively at the cell surface of the H2122-KRASG12C. We further cross-validated the expression of mesothelin using WB. Taken together, present approach greatly extends the known cell surface phenotype of the NSCLC H2122-KRASG12C cells and can be readily employed as a primary proteomic screen to provide the basis for discovery and characterization of novel cell surface therapeutic targets or diagnostic assays in cells/tissues harboring oncogenic K-Ras.']",

        "Background":"['We have sequenced the exomes of over 100 and the genomes of over 20 lung adenocarcinoma tumor-normal specimen pairs. We performed hybrid capture exome sequencing of nearly 18,000 genes to >100X median per-sample coverage with 76bp paired-end reads. We performed whole genome sequencing achieving 60X median tumor and 20X median normal coverage with 350bp median insert size and 101bp paired-end reads. Our exome analysis yielded over 50,000 substitution and small indel coding events, with a mean somatic mutation rate of 10-11 events / MB. This resulted in over 300 non-synonymous coding events per patient, most of which were presumed to be passenger mutations unrelated to tumorigenesis. This high mutational load required us to develop novel statistical approaches (MutSig, Lawrence et al, in preparation) to identify putative lung adenocarcinoma driver genes under positive somatic selection. We constructed a complex neutral mutation model that considered sequence context and several additional genomic covariates shown to mediate gene to gene inhomogeneities of passenger mutation rates. Identification of significant deviations from this background model allowed us to recover almost all known frequently mutated lung adenocarcinoma genes, including TP53, KRAS, STK11, PIK3CA, EGFR, ERBB2, RB1, SMARCA4, and KEAP1, as well as a host of novel putative driver genes. We applied similar principles to identify pathways and sub-networks of genes undergoing apparent positive selection in lung adenocarcinoma. Whole genome analysis yielded several high-confidence in-frame protein fusion and promoter-gene fusion events enriched in tumor vs normal specimens. We also found large numbers of somatic substitution and indel events in promoters, enhancers, and non-coding DNA elements and identified putative sites of somatic retrotransposition in our whole genome data. Overall, our study eclipses previous large-scale characterization of somatic sequence variation (Refs. 1-3) in lung adenocarcinoma by at least an order of magnitude. Using novel methods adapted to the analysis of high-mutation rate tumor types (lung squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, colorectal cancer), we are able to recover signals of selection in both known and novel genes and pathways.

The Delta16 splice variant, lacking exon 16, has the properties of an activated oncogene, but it could also play beneficial roles in the response to targeted therapeutic agents. To study mammary carcinogenesis in a mouse model that mimics human coexpression of full-length HER-2 and Delta16 isoforms, we produced hybrid mice bearing heterozygous copies of both human transgenes (F1 mice), and we compared them to parental mice (Delta16 and HER-2 transgenic mice, respectively). Tumor onset in F1 and Delta16 mice was much faster than in HER-2 mice (30 vs >80 weeks), but the growth of established tumors and metastatic spread were not enhanced. Each mammary carcinoma of F1 mice expressed both isoforms at variable ratios. Most (80%) expressed high levels of Delta16 and low levels of full length HER-2, a few (5%) expressed full-length HER-2 and little, if any, Delta 16, and the remainder (15%) coexpressed at high level both isoforms. The study of tumor vascularization showed that full-length HER-2 tumors mainly contained few large vessels or vascular lacunae, whereas Delta16 tumors were perfused by numerous endothelium-lined small vessels. F1 tumors with high full-length HER-2 expression made few large vessels, whereas tumors with low full-length HER-2 and high Delta16 contained numerous small vessels and expressed high levels of both VEGF and VEGFR2. Administration of trastuzumab to young F1 mice effectively prevented mammary carcinoma onset in 85% of mice at 1 year of age. The preventive effect of trastuzumab was stronger in F1 mice than in both parental strain. To analyze the intrinsic sensitivity of F1 mammary carcinoma cells to targeted drugs in 3D, we established cell lines expressing different HER-2 isoform ratios. High Delta16 expression caused high sensitivity to HER-2 inhibitors (trastuzumab, neratinib, lapatinib), whereas high full-length HER-2 was associated with a lower sensitivity. Interestingly, high levels of both isoforms was associated with resistance to trastuzumab, but sensitivity to small molecule inhibitors. In conclusion, the coexpression of full-length HER-2 and Delta16 controls several determinants of mammary carcinoma development, progression and sensitivity to targeted agents, as revealed by the study of F1 mice.']",

        "Background":"['Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor in children and adolescents, with recurring disease or lung metastases being the primary cause of death in patients. Expression of EGFR, Her-2, and Her-4 (ERBB1, 2 and 4) have been reported in human primary osteosarcoma, suggesting that they may be contributing to osteosarcoma pathogenesis, but the correlation of expression levels with patient outcomes has been controversial. We have shown that a pan-ERBB small molecule kinase inhibitor causes growth inhibition and apoptosis of osteosarcoma cell in vitro, suggesting a potential therapeutic benefit of using this drug in vivo. In the present study, we show that protein expression levels of EGFR, Her-2 and Her-4 are higher in osteosarcoma lung metastases than in primary tumors by TMA, and that these levels are significantly higher for Her-2 and Her-4. We created eight new osteosarcoma cell lines from primary patient tissues and found that all eight, in addition to six commonly used osteosarcoma cell lines, express detectable levels of EGFR and Her-2, and several express detectable Her-4. EGF ligand stimulation in vitro produces robust phosphorylation of EGFR, Her-2 and Her-4 in most cell lines and moderate activation in others. EGF stimulation also produces phosphorylation of Akt, MAPK and p70S6K in most cell lines and of STAT5 in six cell lines, suggesting that EGF has growth and survival stimulation effects. When adding a pan-ERBB kinase inhibitor, Pf-299804, to cells pre-stimulated with EGF, phosphorylation of EGFR, Her-2, Her-4, Akt, etc. are inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Reverse phase protein array also shows an increase in pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and cleaved PARP with Pf-299804 treatment, confirmed by Western blots.

Afatinib is an irreversible TKI for EGFR and HER2 and known to be effective to the EGFR T790M variant. However, a half of the patient responded afatinib acquire resistance by 12 months in clinical use.

We also investigated these cell lines to understand mechanisms of afatinib resistances in NSCLC.[Materials and Methods] Afatinib resistant cell lines were established using four NSCLC cell lines with activating EGFR mutations by exposing afatinib with different procedures, escalation from 1 nM, escalation from 10 nM, intermittent 2 M and continuous 2 M procedures. These cell lines were investigated about previously reported resistant related features, T790M mutation, MET amplification, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).

HCC827 sublines exposed afatinib with escalation from 10 nM and continuous 2 M, and HCC4006 sublines showed EMT features. Furthermore, ALDH1A1 and ABCB1 expression were up-regulated in HCC827 afatinib resistant sublines with EMT features. Next, we examined the effect of afatinib or crizotinib for the afatinib resistant cell line with MET amplification. We found that combination therapy with afatinib and crizotinib was effective to the MET amplified cell. The combination exposure was continued to establish a resistant subline (HCC827-ACR) to combination therapy. The HCC827-ACR was also showed EMT features and up-regulation of stem cell markers.[Conclusions] As in the cases of reversible EGFR-TKI, MET amplification, EMT, and stem cell-like features were emerged in afatinib resistant cells.

To investigate novel mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI, we examined HER-family ligands and HER-family receptor status in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines (n=13). Cell lines were divided into two groups with respect to EGFR-TKI sensitivity', ' highly sensitive (HCC827, PC-9, HCC2935, and HCC4006) and resistant (H1395, H1666, H596, H1437, A549, H226B, H1299, H460, H1792). We examined expression levels of eleven HER-family ligands_EGF, TGF, amphiregulin (AREG), betacellulin (BTC), HB-EGF, epigen (EPGN), epiregulin (EREG), and neuregulin (NRG) 1, NRG2, NRG3, and NRG4_in these cell lines. NRG2, NRG4, and EPGN were expressed at 39.5-, 31.4-, and 6.5-fold higher levels, respectively, in EGFR-TKI primary resistant NSCLC cell lines than in highly sensitive cell lines, whereas TGFA, EGF, and AREG were expressed at 0.22-, 0.3-, and 0.34-fold lower levels. Phosphorylation of EGFR was elevated in sensitive cell lines compared to resistant cell lines, but HER2-4 receptors did not evidence a difference in phsophorylation. These results suggest that the EGFR pathway is activated in sensitive cell lines, and HER2-4, which binds to EPGN, EREG, NRG2, and NRG4, might be activated in resistant cell lines. We prepared cell lines HCC827GR and HCC827ER, derived from HCC827, which acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib, respectively. We analyzed HER-family ligands and receptors using these cell lines. Compared to parent cells, EPGN, EREG, HB-EGF, TGFA, NRG1, and AREG were up-regulated in HCC827GR. Phosphorylation status of EGFR, HER2, and HER3 was not altered, but that of HER4 was increased in HCC827GR. In HCC827ER, EGFR binding ligands AREG, BTC, and EGF were down-regulated, while phosphorylation of EGFR, HER2, and HRE3 was decreased. However, NRG2 was remarkably elevated and HER4 and its downstream STAT5 were phosphorylated. These results indicate that HER4 and its binding ligands may contribute to acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI. Considering these results, it is possible that the HER4-STAT5 pathway might be common to primary and acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI. We continue to investigate its significance.']",

While T cell responses to some tumors occur spontaneously, the majority of cancers are not naturally recognized by the immune system.

Activating the STING pathway represents one strategy for increasing infiltration of T cells into the TME. This induces interferon-β (IFN-β) production, leading to dendritic cell (DC) activation and priming of tumor antigen specific CD8+ T cells that mediate tumor regression. The intratumoral injection (IT) of ML-RR-S2-CDA (ADU-S100), a synthetic cyclic dinucleotide STING agonist, has antitumor efficacy in several aggressive mouse tumor models, including B16 melanoma, CT26 colon carcinoma, Panc02 pancreatic carcinoma, and 4T1 triple negative breast cancer.

While carcinomas are composed primarily of epithelial cells, tumors contain a continuum of cells with epithelial and mesenchymal-like properties. This tumor cell heterogeneity is attributed to differentiation plasticity, which is characterized by epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) or mesenchymal to epithelial transitions (MET). It has been proposed that tumor cells undergo EMT in order to disseminate from the primary tumor and MET in order to seed at secondary sites. The invasive mesenchymal carcinoma cell phenotype is thought to be a state required for tumor dissemination, but to date, pathologists have not found conclusive evidence of mesenchymal cells in human metastatic tumor samples. An alternative theory suggests that both mesenchymal and epithelial cells are required for metastasis to occur. According to this theory, detachment from the primary tumor and invasion by mesenchymal cells facilitates the movement of epithelial tumor cells that are able to seed at distant sites. We hypothesize that the presence of mesenchymal-like mammary tumor cells facilitate the metastasis of epithelial tumor cells and that only epithelial cells are able to seed at distant sites. To test this hypothesis, we cloned epithelial and mesenchymal-like primary cell lines from spontaneous mammary tumors produced in FVB MMTV/Neu mice. Epithelial cells have been stably transfected to express firefly luciferase and GFP, and we are in the process of cloning mesenchymal-like cells expressing Renilla luciferase and mCherry. We have preliminary data that shows that when clonal epithelial cells are administered into the mammary fat pad of FVB MMTV/Neu mice, tumors grow, but do not form metastatic lesions. In contrast, when stably transfected clonal epithelial cells are administered with non-transfected clonal mesenchymal-like tumor cells, luciferase+ metastatic lesions in the spleen, liver and lung are detected biophotonically, and GFP + cells are detected in the spleen and liver. These data indicate that epithelial cells are present (but does not rule out the presence of mesenchymal cells) at the metastatic site.

However despite the high response rates to these agents, acquired resistance to ALK TKI therapy remains a significant barrier to overcome in order to maximize therapeutic responses in patients with ALK+ lung cancer. In crizotinib-resistant tumors, EGFR activation has been demonstrated to mediate acquired resistance in several independent studies. The tumor suppressor gene product MIG-6 (encoded by ERFFI1) acts as a natural inhibitor of signaling through EGFR (ErbB1) and other ErbB family members. However, a role for MIG-6 in ALK+ lung cancer has not yet been elucidated. Here, we investigated the regulation of human MIG-6 in ALK+ lung cancer cells.DESIGN', ' MIG-6 expression, protein interaction and phosphorylation status were evaluated in ALK+ lung cancer cell lines and human tumor samples. The impact of MIG-6 loss and gain of function on ErbB receptor activity and on cell proliferation/survival were determined in several models of TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant ALK+ lung cancer.RESULTS', ' MIG-6 protein level is regulated by EML4-ALK fusion protein at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. Genetic or pharmacologic knock-down of ALK significantly reduced MIG-6 protein levels in ALK+/TKI sensitive cells. We established a novel interaction between MIG-6 and ALK fusion proteins (both EML4-ALK and other fusion partners), and this association was dependent on ALK kinase activity. MIG-6 can also be tyrosine-phosphorylated by EML4-ALK and be threonine-phosphorylated through EML4-ALK-dependent MAPK activation. The reduced MIG-6 protein level was accompanied by increased total and phosphorylated ErbB family members (EGFR, HER2, and HER3) in ALK+/TKI sensitive lung cancer cells. Consistent with this observation, MIG-6 protein level is also attenuated in ALK+/TKI resistant cells, following the decreased EML4-ALK activity, while EGFR signaling activity is remarkably up-regulated in these resistant cells. Crizotinib-resistant cells were re-sensitized upon exposure to EGFR/HER2 inhibitors in combination with crizotinib. In addition, MIG-6 reconstitution impeded the development of early adaptive resistance in crizotinib-sensitive cells and was also able to inhibit the proliferation of crizotinib-resistant cells.CONCLUSION', ' Our study presents an in-depth mechanistic understanding of how ErbB family members, such as EGFR, are up-regulated at the time of crizotinib resistance and provides insights into the early escape mechanisms tumor may have to evade ALK TKI therapy.']",

Tumorigenic and metastatic ability of HER-2-negative cells was increased in comparison to HER-2+ cells. As expected, HER-2 loss was accompanied by resistance to HER-2 targeted monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors.

Whether other reported or novel mutations are important in EGFR/HER2 signaling in colorectal and other cancer types is unclear. To better understand effects of HER2 mutations we characterized a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumor models representing colorectal, ovary, pancreas and endometrial cancers using RNA- and DNA-based sequencing.

The identification of additional mechanisms that suppress immune cell function is stimulating the search for other immune modulating agents that are additive or synergistic with current immune checkpoint inhibitors or are capable of overcoming mechanisms of resistance and tolerance. Extracellular adenosine and its signaling through A2AR increases the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs), and attenuates tumor-specific CD4+/CD8+ T cells. In this study we evaluated the role of a small-molecule inhibitor of A2AR in enhancing antitumor immunity against murine Her-2/neu (neu)-expressing breast cancer. We examined whether an A2AR inhibitor would enhance the activity of cancer specific CD8+ T cells when given with a T cell inducing vaccine. To test this, neu-expressing mammary tumor bearing HER-2/neu transgenic (Neu-N) mice were treated with low dose cyclophosphamide (Cy) to deplete Tregs followed one day later with a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and neu-expressing whole cell vaccine (GVAX). Mice were treated with the A2AR inhibitor, CPI-444, by oral gavage daily for twelve days. Mice also received adoptively transferred high-avidity nave neu-specific CD8+ T cells intravenously one day after vaccination. Mice were monitored for tumor progression, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were harvested from additional mice at multiple time points and analyzed for T cell activation by flow cytometry. Inflammatory changes in the tumor microenvironment were assessed by immunohistochemistry. We found that T cells adoptively transferred to mice together with Cy, a neu-targeted vaccine and CPI-444 are more effective at reducing established tumors and delaying tumor progression when compared with mice treated with Cy, vaccine, adoptively transferred T cells and vehicle control. Of particular note, mice receiving the same treatment but with CPI-444 in lieu of vehicle had a significant mean difference in tumor area of 6.446mm2 (P<0.05) when compared to the vaccine and vehicle control cohort. When compared to the tumor alone cohort, mice receiving the full therapeutic regimen had a significant mean difference in tumor area of 13.59mm2 (P<0.001).

Moreover, this GTPase has been found overexpressed in a number of tumors, including lymphomas, oral and esophageal carcinoma, and breast cancer. To address the role of this protein in epithelial tumors, we have carried out an extensive characterization of this GTPase using RRas2 knockout mice and shRNA knockdown tumor cells. These studies revealed that RRas2 is not important for the development and/or malignant progression of skin and oral squamous cell carcinoma. Instead, we have observed that the RRas2 deficiency severily impairs breast cancer tumorigenesis and the tropism of metastatic cancer cells to the lung. The characterization of the role of RRas2 in primary tumorigenesis indicates that this GTPase is important for the proliferation and angiogenesis of tumors. In the case of metastasis, RRas2 is important for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells in the lung parenchyma. By contrast, this GTPase is not required for the lymph node infiltration, intravasation, or extravasation of cancer cells. Interestingly, the requirement of RRas2 is still maintained in breast cancer cells that express active mutants of K-Ras, indicating that RRas2 plays essential roles downstream of both Her2 and K-Ras.

Anti-EGFR agents including EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have considered to be effective for NSCLC when drug sensitive EGFR mutation is present.

However, the association of BCAR4 and lung cancer has not been identified. Here, we describe the oncogenic effect of BCAR4 in human lung cancer. Expression pattern of BCAR4 was examined in lung cancer cell lines, primary tumor tissues, and adjacent normal tissues. BCAR4 was highly expressed in 71% of lung cancer cell lines and especially in 43% of cancer tissues of lung adenocarcinoma patients who did not harbor the activational mutations of EGFR nor KRAS.

Signal transduction through the GPCR A2AR enhances the immunosuppressive activity of Tregs while simultaneously attenuating tumor-specific CD4+/CD8+ T cells. We have evaluated the appropriate coordination and dosing for a small-molecule inhibitor of A2AR in a Her-2/neu expressing murine model of breast cancer. We have demonstrated its capacity to augment existing therapeutic strategies in this tolerant model.

Further, we have observed both broad and specific changes in the T cell compartment of the tumor-infiltrating leukocyte (TIL) population.

BAP1 and PP2R1A mutations were more frequent in mesenchymal tumors, independent of primary site (adjusted p value <0.05). Conversely, NSD1 and KEAP1 mutations were more frequent in tumors with low EMT scores (epithelial) (p<0.05). Overall mutation burden and CNAs were not associated with mesenchymal status. A striking association between miR expression and EMT score was observed across most tumor types, including low miR 200 family and high miR 199a and 214 expression in mesenchymal cancers (r>0.3). PTTs commonly expressed in mesenchymal tumors included AXL, PDGFRA/B, MMP2 and DDR2 (r>0.6). Of these, investigation of the DSDs supported in vitro sensitivity of mesenchymal cell lines overall to PDGFR and GSK3 inhibitors, but resistance to drugs targeting ErbB family members, including the dual VEGF/EGFR inhibitor vandetanib (p<0.001) and drugs targeting Her2 and/or EGFR (p<0.001). In contrast, other EMT-associated drug resistance was tissue specific, such as resistance of mesenchymal breast cancer lines to mTOR inhibition (p 0.03).Conclusions', ' Application of the EMT signature to diverse tumor types identifies highly conserved patterns of gene and miRs expression, including high miR-199a expression in mesenchymal cancers. While mutational landscape and CNAs were most often driven by tumor type, protein expression and drug sensitivity were influenced by a combination of tumor type and EMT status. New associations between drug response and EMT were identified, such as the sensitivity of mesenchymal cancers to PDGFR and GSK3 inhibitors, that warrant further investigation.']",

        "Background":"[\"Despite recent advances, clinically-relevant oncogenic drivers have not been identified in about half of lung adenocarcinormas. Here, we report rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR) amplification as a novel genetic abnormality in a young patient with non-small cell lung cancer. This male patient was a never smoker and was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinorma at the age of 18. He initially presented with refractory cough and persistent left lung lesions. Pathology was consistent with lung adenocarcinorma, poorly differentiated. Extensive molecular testing was negative for common genetic alterations in K-RAS, EGFR, ALK, HER2, RET, AKT, PIK3CA, BRAF and ROS1. His tumor was subsequently subjected to next generation DNA sequencing (FoundationOne, Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA) targeting a cohort of more than 180 cancer-related genes. This analysis identified rictor amplification of at least 6 copies as the sole DNA abnormality. Immunohistochemistry further documented rictor overexpression in the patient's lung tumor. The neoplastic lung tissue exhibited diffuse and strong cytoplasmic staining for rictor, compared to surrounding non-neoplastic tissues. Furthermore, the tumor tissue showed diffuse overexpression of phospho-S473 Akt, an essential downstream target of rictor.Rictor is a key component of mTORC2 complex, where it modifies actin cytoskeleton organization, cell proliferation and survival. Activation of rictor signaling has been suggested to play critical roles in regulating cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis in breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers and gliomas. To our knowledge, this is the first report of rictor amplification in lung cancer. Moreover, we found that blockade of the rictor-mTORC2 pathway by siRNA-mediated rictor knockdown or with pharmacological inhibitors led to decreased phosphorylation of S473-AKT and growth inhibition in lung cancer cell lines. Thus, rictor amplification may represent a potential novel target in lung cancer. We will perform further studies to determine whether rictor amplification is a unique molecular subtype of lung cancer. Further, we hope to identify which targeted drugs are active against tumors with rictor amplification and overexpression.\"]",

To investigate alpha-emitter targeting of metastatic breast cancer using clinically relevant, commercially available anti-HER2/neu antibodies, we have developed cell lines derived from HuHER2 mice (MMTV.f.HuHER2 obtained from Genetech). HuHER2 mice develop breast cancer spontaneously and with a higher frequency than normal mice.We extracted primary mammary gland tumors, purified the epithelial breast cancer cells, and established 7 different HuHER2 cell lines. We also established 2 different cell lines from spontaneous lung metastases (HuHER2-L1 and -L2). We evaluated HuHER2 protein expression in the cell lines by western blot analysis. Cell surface receptor expression was evaluated by immunofluorescence (IF) staining. We performed qRT-PCR to assess phenotypic measures of aggressiveness and metastatic propensity. The following were evaluated', ' ER, PR, Twist1, Vimentin and E-Cadherin. Sensitivity to trastuzumab antibody, in vitro, was also assessed by evaluating changes in cellular metabolism via the MTT assay.HuHER2 protein was overexpressed in all of the isolated cell lines. One of the cell lines (denoted HuHER2-6) had approximately 1.5-8 times more protein expression compared to the other 6 cell lines developed. The two cell lines derived from spontaneous lung metastases showed approximately 1.5-fold greater HER2 protein expression than HuHER2-6. HuHER2-6 cell surface HER2 receptor staining by IF was similar to that of BT-474, a high HuHER2 expressing cell line. The 2 lung cell lines also showed comparable cell-surface staining. ER mRNA levels assessed by qRT-PCR were 20% and 0.05% of the level measured in normal mammary gland for the HuHER2-6 and HuHer2-L2 lines, respectively.

        "Background":"['A multitude of studies show that alterations in Ca2+ signalling initiate or support the development of hallmarks of cancer. In particular, the role of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in tumorigenesis and tumour progression has been subject to intense investigation. SOCE is the main mechanism by which external Ca2+ enters into the cell. It is initiated by depletion of ER Ca2+ stores and mediated by several proteins such as STIM1, an ER transmembrane protein sensing Ca2+ within the ER and ORAI1, a plasma membrane Ca2+ channel. We recently showed that SOC inhibition interfered with EGFR-dependent signalling in non-small cell lung carcinoma cells.In this study, we observed that STIM1 depletion reduced neuregulin-dependent proliferation of breast cancer cells. Since neuregulin binds to ErbB3 and/or ErbB4 and therefore activates ErbB2, this result prompted us to investigate whether ErbB proteins might modulate SOCE. We observed that lapatinib, a dual inhibitor of EGFR and ErbB2, dramatically inhibited SOCE. As expected, lapatinib also inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR, ErbB2 and downstream pathways of both receptors. Specific inhibition of EGFR by erlotinib or gefitinib had no effect on SOCE. In contrast, specific inhibition of ErbB2 by CP724714 mimicked the effects of lapatinib. We also investigated the role of downstream pathways of ErbB2 in the modulation of SOCE. Inhibition of the MAPK and the JAK-STAT pathways does not modify the amplitude of SOCE. Contrariwise, LY294002 and MK2206, two inhibitors of the PI3K pathway, dramatically reduced SOCE. Interestingly, in silico analysis showed that STIM1 might be phosphorylated by Akt.All these results suggest that SOCE is important in the proper function of ErbB2-dependent signalling. This raises the possibility to target molecular mediators of SOCE in order to interfere with the proliferation of cancer cells.']",

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of all lung cancers worldwide. The EGFR family of genes is known to be highly expressed in NSCLC tumors and play a critical role in the progression of the disease. Although patients initially respond well to EGFR TKI therapy, acquired resistance occurs through several mechanisms, including compensatory cMET pathway activation (Robinson et al. 2013). Previous reports have demonstrated that soluble forms of EGFR, Her2 and cMET are generated through either alternate splicing of mRNA or proteolytic cleavage of the full length receptors (Wilken et al. 2013). Serum concentrations of these receptors can be correlated with prognosis as well as treatment response (Gregorc, 2004, Kasahara, 2010 Heinmoller, 2003). Soluble receptor ligands, including Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), have also been evaluated in NSCLC and a strong correlation has also been observed between the levels of serum HGF and disease outcome in patients treated with EGFR-TKIs (Kasahara et al. 2010).In this study, we evaluated concentrations of sEGFR, sMET, sHER2,, and HGF in NSCLC versus healthy normal serum samples via meso scale discovery (MSD) platform. Inventoried and custom MSD assays were optimized to measure these proteins in a training set consisting of 19 NSCLC and 16 normal healthy serum samples. Significantly lower concentrations of sEGFR and sHER2 were observed in the NSCLC serum samples compared to normal (p value = 0.0092 for both receptors), whereas, in contrast, the levels of HGF were significantly higher in the NSCLC patient samples (p value <0.0001). No significant difference in sMET concentration was observed between NSCLC and normal serum. Based on this data, it was determined that a ratio of protein concentration of each soluble receptor (EGFR, Her2 and cMET) to HGF yielded a greater differentiation between NSCLC and normal samples (p value <0.0001, = 0.0041,and 0.0327 respectively). Cut-off values to define NSCLC versus normal patients were established for each ratio and validated in a blinded independent cohort, consisting of 50 NSCLC and 12 healthy normal serum samples. PPV and NPV were then calculated to determine sensitivity and specificity for each protein ratio. Results from the validation study show an almost complete separation between healthy and NSCLC patient samples (p value <0.0001, AUC = 1)for all three ratios tested (sEGFR/HGF, sHER2/HGF and sMET/HGF), with a PPV = 100%, 98%, 100% and NPV = 100%, 100%, 85.7%, respectively.

Median duration of treatment was 6 months for pemetrexed platinum/bevacizumab, 3 months for taxane platinum/bevacizumab, 4 months for gemcitabine, 4 months for vinorelbine, 5 months for mitomycin vinblastine. The median duration of targeted therapy was 3 months for trastuzumab, 4 months for small molecule HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 3 months for erlotinib. No objective responses were noted with trastuzumab (n = 2) or lapatinib (n = 4) alone.  Conclusions', '   Most HER2-mutant lung tumors demonstrate an identical 12bp in-frame insertion (YVMA) in exon 20. In our cohort, the median duration of treatment with chemotherapy was double that of HER2-targeted therapies. Pemetrexed-containing regimens had the longest duration of treatment. As we search for better targeted therapies for patients with HER2-mutant lung cancers, chemotherapy remains an important component of care.']",

This study intends to correlate the expressions of HER-2, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) with clinicopathological parameters in breast carcinoma. It is in fact the ever first study of its kind to be carried out in the Mauritian context. Methods', '    A prospective study was conducted during a period of two years (2013-2014) at the Central Health Laboratory, Victoria Hospital; whereby 78 paraffin blocks of consecutive breast cancer cases diagnosed were subjected to ER/ PR testing by immunohistochemistry (IHC). As regards to HER-2 testing, they were sent to Lancet laboratories, South Africa for IHC. Chi-Square test was used to evaluate IHC results with prognostic parameters for breast cancer. Results', '    In the present study, 77 were females and 1 was male; the mean age of patients was 52.7 years ranging from 26 to 80 years, 33 patients (42.3%) were below 50 years of age. 52 cases had defined menopausal status, 67.3% were post-menopausal and 32.7% were pre-menopausal. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma (NOS) was the commonest 48/78 (61.5%) and the other variants 30/78 (38.5%). The overall immunoexpression of ER/PR/HER-2 were 73.6%, 61.8%, 35.9% respectively; HER-2 was overexpressed (3+) in 23.3% of cases and triple negative cases accounted for 17.9%. In terms of laterality, we found that right breast was slightly more involved (53.9%) than left breast (46.2%). ER/PR positivity was associated with Lymph node involvement with marginal significance (p = 0.074). No significant association was found between ER/PR/HER2 as well as with age, tumor size and grade. Conclusions', '    There are high rates of positive expressions of ER/PR/HER-2/neu among the Mauritian population with breast carcinoma. This year the Central Health Laboratory is planning to set up a comprehensive IHC service with on-site testing for HER-2; hence further studies are to be anticipated on the topic.']",

        "Background":"['Introduction. Despite oestrogen and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) targeted therapies improving patient survival, breast cancer continues to be a significant cause of premature death since many tumors do not respond to treatment or acquire resistance. Hence there remains the need to identify novel targets for therapy and biomarkers for prediction of response to treatment. A quantitative proteomics study of matched normal and tumor biopsies identified 63 proteins to be significantly increased or decreased in stage-specific tumors. Some have previously been associated with breast cancer, while others such as cofilin-1 represent new targets for investigation. Cofilin-1 was subject to a range of analyses to determine its association with breast cancer.Materials and Methods. Western blotting (WB) was performed on protein extracts from breast cancer cell lines and matched normal and tumor biopsies from Cypriot patients with different stages of the disease. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was carried out on core biopsies from the Leeds Breast Tissue Bank. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry was performed on trypsin-digested protein extracts from biopsies. Data from protein (Human Protein Atlas) and genomics (BioGPS, TiGER, UniGene) databases were assimilated with the experimental results.Results. WB indicated that cofilin-1 was ubiquitously expressed in tumor cell lines, representative of Luminal A, Luminal B, basal-like, claudin-low and HER2 phenotypes, at higher levels than normal breast cell lines. WB also indicated increased expression of cofilin-1 in invasive carcinoma tissues, compared to matched normal. Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or fibroadenoma exhibited less clear results, either increasing slightly or remaining unchanged. MRM analysis of three cofilin-1 peptides in tissue extracts of invasive carcinoma patients indicated expression only in tumor. IHC of core biopsies exhibited strong staining for cofilin-1 in ductal invasive carcinoma tissues with no staining in normal breast cells. Genomics and proteomics databases indicate that cofilin-1 is expressed in a diverse range of normal tissues including major organs, gastro-intestinal tract, skin and tonsils. However, mRNA and protein levels are observed to be increased in skin, lung, liver, pancreatic and breast tumors.Discussion. The original quantitative proteomics data indicated only relatively small changes in expression (less than 2-fold) due to dynamic range limitations of the technique. Additional analytical approaches substantiated that cofilin-1 is significantly up-regulated in advanced breast cancer patients. Further patient sets are required to confirm the importance of cofilin-1 levels in early stages of breast cancer compared to benign tissues. Bioinformatics provided further confidence in our findings, highlighting the value of utilising databases for evidence of disease-specific proteins.']",

Methods', '    Over 6,700 non-small cell lung cancer cases referred to Caris Life Sciences between 2009 and 2014. Diagnoses and history were collected from referring physicians.  Specific testing was performed per physician request and included a combination of sequencing (Sanger, NGS or pyrosequencing), protein expression (IHC), gene amplification/rearrangement (CISH or FISH), and/or RNA fragment analysis.  Results', '    Tumors profiles from patients with hormone receptor positive disease (HER2, ER, PR, or AR positive by IHC) (n=629), HER2 mutations (n=8) ALK rearrangements (n=55), ROS1 rearrangement (n=17), cMET amplification or mutation (n=126), and cKIT mutation (n=11) were included in this analysis and compared to the whole cohort. Tumors with ALK rearrangement overexpressed AR in 18% of cases, and 7% presented with concomitant KRAS mutation. Lower rates of PTEN loss, as assessed by IHC, were observed in ALK positive (20%), ROS1 positive (9%) and cKIT mutated tumors (25%) compared to the overall NSCLC population (58%). cMET was overexpressed in 66% of ROS1 translocated and 57% of HER2 mutated tumors. cKIT mutations were found co-existing with APC (20%) and EGFR (20%) mutations. Pathway analysis revealed that hormone receptor positive disease carried more mutations in the ERK pathway (32%) compared to 9% in the mTOR pathway. 25% of patients with HER2 mutations harbored a co-existing mutation in the mTOR pathway.  Conclusions', '    Pathway profiling reveals that NSCLC tumors present more often than reported with several concomitant alterations affecting the ERK or AKT pathway.

        "Background":"['Background', ' The occurrence of EGFR and KRAS mutations in squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC) of lung is controversial due in part to very limited pathology data in many published studies, and the prevalence of other mutations is not established. We hypothesized that full pathologic and immunohistochemical (IHC) characterization of genotyped SQCC cases could help resolve these uncertainties.  Methods', ' Fifty resected SQCC with IHC confirmation (TTF1-/p63+) were screened for hot-spot point mutations in EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, AKT1, BRAF, ERBB2, and MAP2K1 by Sequenom and EGFR exon 19 deletions by standard methods. In addition, 15 SQCC found to harbor EGFR (n=9) or KRAS (n=6) mutations on routine clinical testing underwent a detailed clinicopathologic and IHC reassessment.  Results', ' No EGFR or KRAS mutations were found in 50 pure resected SQCC (0% observed incidence; 95% CI 0-7%), whereas PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations were identified in 6% (95% CI 1-17%) and 2% (95% CI 0-11%) of cases, respectively. Reassessment of 15 SQCC with EGFR/KRAS mutations revealed that none could be confirmed to represent pure SQCC. Seven of 15 (47%) cases were small biopsy/cytology specimens showing SQCC but specimens from other sites (metastatic or primary) revealed adenocarcinoma (ADC) or adenosquamous carcinoma (AD-SQC) harboring mutations identical to those in SQCC (when other-site mutation data was available). One case (7%) was a small biopsy showing SQCC but subsequent same-site resection revealed AD-SQC. Six cases (40%) were re-classified as solid ADC after IHC.  Conclusions', ' EGFR/KRAS mutations do not occur in pure SQCC, and when detected in specimens reported as SQCC they may represent a component of AD-SQC or solid ADC. These findings highlight the importance of IHC for the accurate diagnosis of SQCC, which is essential for interpreting molecular data. For pure SQCC in resection specimens, routine EGFR mutation testing is not indicated. Because small specimens may not distinguish SQCC from AD-SQC, testing should be guided by clinical parameters as further addressed by Paik et al (abstract submitted, ASCO 2011).

Two recent large meta-analyses of case control studies have found a significant association between TGFBR1*6A and risk of several types of cancer, including breast cancer (ORs 1.16,1.01-1.34; 1.15,1.01-1.31). To investigate the effects of constitutively decreased TGFBR1 signaling on cancer development, we developed a novel mouse model of Tgfbr1 haploinsufficiency to mimic the decreased TGFBR1 signaling observed in individuals with higher risk of cancer. Using this model, we demonstrated that Apcmin;Tgfbr1+/- mice develop more than twice as many intestinal tumors as Apcmin controls. The aim of the current study was to assess the effects of Tgfbr1 haploinsufficiency on breast carcinogenesis by crossing Tgfbr1+/- mice with the MMTV-c-Neu mouse model.Methods', ' Fully congenic (100%) FVB/N-Tgfbr1+/- mice were crossed with FVB/N-Neu mice, and female virgin progeny were kept for analysis. Mammary glands were collected from 10, 12, and 40 week-old Neu and Neu;Tgfbr1+/- mice. Mice assessed for tumor development were sacrificed 80 days after the initial tumor palpation or at the earliest sign of morbidity. Whole lungs, tumor tissue, and primary tumor cells were collected for additional analysis.

In the assessment of breast tumor development, Neu;Tgfbr1+/- mice were observed to have a significantly shorter tumor latency period (171 days) compared to Neu mice (220 days) (p=0.004). Seventy percent of Neu;Tgfbr1+/- mice (14/20) developed surface lung metastases, while 36.4% were observed in Neu mice (8/22), a borderline significant difference (p=0.061).

With the exception of HER-2 and EGFR amplification, there are currently no validated biomarkers to predict response to biological therapies in this disease. The purpose of this study was to identify new biomarker defined therapeutic approaches for patients with oesophageal cancer.Experimental approachWe have undertaken a functional screening approach focused on the druggable kinome to generate a first map of the genetic dependencies found in oesophageal cancer. A panel of 19 oesophageal and 130 non-oesophageal cancer cell lines were screened with siRNA targeting 720 kinases to generate functional profiles. By integrating this dataset with exome sequencing and copy number data, we identified key genetic dependencies (KGDs) associated with oesophageal histology (adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma) or key driver genotypes including amplifications in c-MYC, CCND1, EGFR and ERBB2, as well as loss of functional mutations in SMAD4 and ARID1A.ResultsInterrogation of the oesophageal functional genomics dataset established oncogene addiction effects including c-MYC, which is amplified in 30% of oesophageal carcinomas. We confirmed that a novel isoform of Bruton agammaglobulinaemia tyrosine kinase gene (BTK-C) was expressed in oesophageal cancer models and that silencing of BTK resulted in selective lethality in c-MYC amplified oesophageal cell lines. To further assess the impact of BTK inhibition in oesophageal cancer, we treated a panel of oesophageal cell lines with increasing doses of ibrutinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of BTK. Analysis of ibrutinib SF50 revealed that there was preferential sensitivity to ibrutinib in c-MYC amplified oesophageal cell lines. Furthermore, we observed a significant association between mutation of the chromatin remodelling factor gene SMARCA4 and dependency upon the bromodomain protein BRD4. We also identified SMAD4 kinase genetic dependencies including AKT1 and a number of its substrates (FGR, MAP3K3, CHEK1 and WEE1). We noted a densely connected group of kinases that regulate the mitotic cell cycle in the SMAD4 dependency network, and found that SMAD4 mutant cell lines exhibited an increased sensitivity to drugs, including paclitaxel, that target the mitotic checkpoint.ConclusionsOur results support the potential of BTK small molecule inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy in c-MYC amplified oesophageal carcinoma.

The HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel Assay (OBP) is based on a novel derivative of our quantitative nuclease protection chemistry (qNPA) that enables extraction-free quantitation (detection) of mRNA from variety of sample types including formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue.Purpose', ' To determine (1) linearity across a range of sample inputs, (2) recommended sample input amounts for FFPE, cells, and extracted RNA, and (3) reproducibility of the HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel Assay in measuring the mRNA expression of 2,560 genes.Methods', ' Lysates of 5 micron sections of FFPE tissues (lung, breast, prostate, and colon carcinoma; melanoma; 25 mm2 to 0.78 mm2 per reaction), THP-1 and HCC78 cell lines (7500 cells to 234 cells per reaction), and Universal RNA (URNA; 25 ng to 1.56 ng per reaction) were used for the linearity and sample input studies. URNA (25 ng per reaction) was used to demonstrate reproducibility of the assay across multiple days and processors (one processor across three days and three processors on one day). Sequencing libraries were generated from the qNPA reactions and run on an Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. The HTG EdgeSeq Parser was used for post-sequencing data processing. Linear regression (R2) and Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were used to assess linearity and reproducibility of the assay.Results', ' The R2 for linearity across four concentration points for lung FFPE tissue (6.25-0.78 mm2), cell lines (1875-234 cells), and URNA (12.5-1.56 ng) were >0.97, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively. The (r) between low (1.56 mm2) and high (12.5 mm2) sample inputs for each FFPE tissue type was > 0.98. The (r) for intra-run, inter-day, and inter-run reproducibility were > 0.95, > 0.98, and > 0.98 respectively. In addition, differential expression of tissue-specific genes was identified in the respective FFPE tissues, including NKX2 and MUC1 in lung, ERBB2 in breast, NKX3, KLK2, and KLK3 in prostate, and SPP1 and PRAME in melanoma.Conclusions', ' The HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel Assay for a 2,560-gene panel of oncology-related biomarkers is linear over a wide range of sample inputs, can comprehensively analyze very small, clinically relevant tissues, and is highly reproducible. The demonstrated performance of the assay in breast, lung, colon, and prostate cancer and melanoma FFPE samples enables multiplex oncology biomarker profiling of these and other malignant neoplasms.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' For metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), guidelines include molecular testing for actionable biomarkers and recommend broad profile testing. Yet previous studies indicate that not all patients with NSCLC receive testing, even for actionable mutations in EGFR, ALK, and ROS. We hypothesized low testing rates for patients calling a community HelpLine and that we could increase rates with one-on-one caller education and free precision medicine services. Methods', ' Caller statistics were collected on the toll-free Lung Cancer Alliance (LCA) HelpLine from Sept 1, 2016  Jan 31, 2017. Recruitment to the LungMATCH molecular testing program began Nov 10, 2017. Patients are recruited through conversations on the LCA HelpLine, then consented into Perthera Cancer Analysis (PCA) through an IRB-approved registry protocol. PCA includes tissue acquisition, multi-omic molecular profiling, and medical review of testing results and clinical and treatment history. PCA reports are returned to both treating physicians and patients. Data is being collected longitudinally on treatment decisions, patient outcomes including progression-free and overall survival, and patient experience. Results', ' Data from the LCA Helpline identified a gap in molecular testing. 50% (57/115) of patients asked if they received any kind of molecular testing replied \"No\". Of 32 patients who were tested and knew the results, patients indicated potentially actionable changes in EGFR(15), ALK(8), PD-L1(3), RET, MET, BRAF, and HER2, along with KRAS (4). Since LungMATCH launch, 23 interested patients were referred for PCA. Six patients consented and are undergoing PCA with seven more in the consent process. Reasons for non-consent include', ' doctor refusal, initiation of testing at the treating institution, concern about financial implications, and one death. Updated results will be presented. Conclusions', ' Our data indicate that patients with lung cancer are not receiving molecular testing in accordance to guidelines. To address this, we created a program through nonprofit-corporate partnership that navigates patients and their physicians through comprehensive precision therapy. This type of program is feasible and there is patient interest.']",

        "Background":"['Background', ' Limited availability of tissue samples is a major impediment to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) research but patient-derived xenograft (PDX) offers a potential alternative. The high genomic instability of SCLC necessitates the need to establish whether the molecular characteristics of PDXs are preserved across serial propagation in mice.Method', ' PDX were raised using biopsy samples from patients with relapsed SCLC under an IRB-approved protocol. Image guided or bronchoscopic biopsies were directly implanted subcutaneously into SCID mice within 60 minutes of collection and without in vitro culture. Tumor growth was monitored and animals were sacrificed while overall tumor size remained <2g. Harvested tumors were immediately re-implanted into a new set of 5 mice for up to 5 generations while freezing remnant tumor samples in liquid nitrogen for future use. Tumor histology was assessed by standard H&E and immunohistochemistry for neuroendocrine markers (NSE, chromogranin and Synaptophysin). Harvested DNA from tumor samples from all generations of PDX using QiAmp DNA Mini Kit was employed for targeted sequencing at greater than 2,000x coverage on the Illumina MiSeq instrument. A 17-gene panel including frequently encountered genetic aberrations in lung cancer (EGFR, KRAS, TP53, STK11, PTEN, NRAS, ERBB2, MET, NF1 and PIK3CA) was used to characterize molecular phenotype of PDX samples. Molecular homogeneity was assessed by comparing the genetic profile of each PDX across all generations. All identified mutations were compared to the COSMIC database.Results', ' We have successfully raised PDX from 5 of 9 patient biopsies with a lag time from initial implantation to adequate tumor growth ranging between 1.5 and 11 months. Propagation of PDX across generations has been performed for 5 generations (1PDX), 3 generations (2PDXs), 2 generations (2PDXs) and 1 generation (1PDX). There was good preservation of tumor histology assessed by H&E and IHC across generations. Mutations in TP53 gene (c.422G>A[p.Cys141Tyr]; c.913A>T[p.Lys305Ter], c.488A>G[p.Tyr163Cys], c.892G> [p.Glu298Ter]) detected in tumor samples from the first generation mice were preserved across all subsequent generations tested. Additionally, there were no new aberrations detected in this panel of 17 genes when comparing early to later generations of PDX. Conclusions', ' Despite the high degree of genomic instability expected in SCLC, serially propagated PDX of SCLC maintained histologic and molecular characteristics across many generations. Our finding that original tumor characteristics remain well preserved in PDX supports future use of this resource as reliable platform for translational research in SCLC.Supported through the Georgia Cancer Coalition Distinguished Scholar Award and NIH/NCI 5K23CA164015 grant to TK Owonikoko']",

        "Background":"['Her-2/neu oncogene is overexpressed in human breast cancer and is correlated with the tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, and resistance against chemo- and hormonotherapy. The expression levels of both Her-2/neu gene and HER-2 protein are recommended for evaluation of treatment efficacy as well as for selection of treatments. However, clinical studies have shown that the Her-2/neu gene and the HER-2 protein are differently expreesed in 10-15% of human breast cancers and we hypothesized that the expression difference might be related to the post-transcriptional regulation of the Her-2/neu gene by microRNAs (miRNAs). To identify the specific miRNAs, we first analyzed 120 human breast cancer samples for the Her-2/neu gene amplification and protein expression with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Fourty-four cancer samples (36.7%, 44/120) showed overexpression of HER-2 protein with IHC (IHC+) and 26 samples (26.5%, 26/98) exhibited Her-2/neu gene amplification with FISH (FISH+). Interestingly, five samples exhibited amplification of the Her-2/neu gene, but absence of the HER-2 protein expression (FISH+/IHC-). We then dissected the FISH+/IHC- tumor cells using laser capture microdissection from the five samples. Tumor cells with FISH+/IHC+ from another set of five samples were also dissected and analyzed as the control. Based on TargetScanHuman and literature search, five candidate miRNAs including miR-125b, -1224-3p, -1296, -193a-5, and -331-3p were screened with quantitative real-time RT-PCR and their expression levels in the FISH+/IHC- cells were 3.1-, 2.7-, 1.7-, 1.7-, and 1.3-fold higher than in the FISH+/IHC+ cells, respectively, with a significant difference for miR-1224-3p and miR-1296 (both P < 0.01). These results indicate that miR-1224-3p and miR-1296 may be responsible for the different expressions of Her-2/neu gene and its protein by regulating the Her-2/neu gene posttranscription, thus down-regulating the HER-2 protein expression in FISH+/IHC- breast cancer cells.']",

L-Type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is one of the major Na+-independent neutral amino acid transporters. LAT1 has an aspect of oncofetal protein. Recently, high levels of LAT1 expression have been reported in various tumors, such as prostate cancer, pancreas cancer, bile duct cancer, lung cancer and stomach cancer.We revealed LAT1 expression is an independent prognosis marker in stomach cancer, prostate cancer and pancreas cancer. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the LAT1 expression in breast carcinoma and relationship between LAT1 expression and prognosis.Materials & Methods', ' We enrolled 290 patients with invasive breast carcinoma surgically resected between 2006 and 2010 at Kitasato University Hospital and Toho University Omori Medical Center, Japan. We investigated LAT1 expression in the enrolled breast carcinoma cases by immunohistochemical staining. All cases were divided into two groups, 78 cases of triple negative carcinoma (TNBC) and 212 cases of non-triple negative carcinoma (NTNBC), with immunohistochemistry of estrogen and progesterone receptors and Her2. After LAT1 expression was compared between TNBC and NTNBC, correlations among LAT1 expression, Ki-67 labeling index (LI), CD98 expression, and clinicopathological findings was assessed.Results', ' TNBC showed significantly higher LAT1 expression than NTNBC. TNBC also showed significantly higher CD98 expression rather than NTNBC. LAT1 expression of extraductal invasive cancer cells was significantly higher than those of intraductal carcinoma cells. A significantly positive correlation was observed between LAT1 expression and CD98 expression. Further, a positive correlation between LAT1 expression and Ki-67 LI was found. Log-rank test in overall breast cancers revealed that high LAT1 expression group showed significantly poor prognosis, compared to low LAT1 group. In NTNBC, high LAT1expression cases possessed poorer prognosis than low LAT1 expression cases.Conclusion', ' In invasive ductal carcinoma of breast, LAT1 expression has a potential for a prognosis prediction factor.

A variety of testing methods exist, allowing institutional selection of which technologies to use and in what order to run them. This descriptive study provides a benchmark on methods used in practice for biomarker testing in breast (BC), gastric/esophageal (GC), and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).  Methods', '  We conducted an IRB-approved web survey of the 58 NCI designated cancer centers (pathologists and oncologists) providing adult care in BC, GC, and NSCLC. We developed a survey instrument with 14 BC, 5 GC, and 10 NSCLC items asking about methods used, order of testing, turn around time (TAT) and if tests are internally developed (ID).  Results', '  For BC, 32% (18/57) of sites run concurrent rather than reflex HER2 FISH and IHC testing, citing quality assurance reasons. Average TAT for concurrent vs reflex testing is 6.5 and 9.5 days. Rates of ID tests are 14% (8/57) for PgR, 12% (7/57) for ER and 7% (4/57) for HER2. For GC, 39% (21/54) of sites run concurrent HER2 FISH and IHC tests, citing reasons of quality assurance and evolving guidelines. TAT for concurrent vs reflex testing is 6.3 and 9.5 days. 19% (10/54) of sites use ID HER2 tests. All reporting sites use EGFR and ALK testing in NSCLC and 96% use KRAS. 24% (13/55) of sites run them concurrently with an average TAT of 7.6 days, while the average TAT for sites with sequential testing is 22.8 days. CAP recommends a 10 day TAT for NSCLC tests, and 92% (12/13) of sites with concurrent testing meet this guideline vs only 11% (4/38) of sites with sequential testing (p<.0001). Rates of ID tests are 57% (30/53) for KRAS, 47% (26/55) for EGFR and 35% (19/55) for ALK, for which a kit is listed on the FDA drug label. There is a difference in the use of ID tests between BC and NSCLC, p<.0148.  Conclusions', '  Concurrent testing for BC and GC HER2, and for NSCLC markers is a common practice at NCI cancer centers; and it improves TAT. Concurrent NSCLC testing allows meeting CAP TAT guideline, but sequential testing does not.

        "Background":"['We have recently found that expression of Facilitates Chromatin Transcription (FACT) complex consisting of SSRP1 and SPT16 protein subunits is elevated in many types of cancer comparing with normal tissues. Moreover, survival of tumor cell, but not normal cells is significantly compromised upon genetic knockdown of any of the FACT subunits. In our recent studies we have shown that FACT is essential for the transcriptional activity of NF-B and Heat Shock Factor 1 and identified small molecules that inhibit activity of both transcription factors by causing functional inactivation of FACT. Since both NF-kB and HSF1 are activated in the process of transformation, we proposed that FACT may be involved in tumor transformation and that inhibition of FACT activity may prevent or reduce tumorigenesis. Objectives of our study were', ' (i) to check if FACT level is changed in the process of oncogene-induced transformation in vitro and in vivo; and (ii) to test safety and efficacy of anti-FACT therapy with Curaxin-137 in prevention of tumor formation in mice prone to cancer due to oncogene overexpression. We used in vitro (Ha-ras12V) and in vivo (MMTV-neu transgenic mouse model) models of transformation to monitor changes in FACT subunits. We treated the MMTV-neu transgenic mice, in which mammary carcinomas are spontaneously developed due to estrogen receptor-regulated expression of the Her2 proto-oncogene, with Curaxin-137 to determine whether the drug has any toxic effect on normal tissues and/or impact on mammary carcinogenesis. Expression of FACT was elevated in the process of transformation in all models tested. Chronic administration of Curaxin-137 to MMTV-neu mice at doses not having any toxic effect, inhibited tumor onset, delayed tumor progression, and prolonged survival of mice in a dose-dependent manner. Curaxin-137 induced much stronger changes in FACT in tumors than in normal organs, expressing FACT (spleen). Thus, Curaxin-137 may be considered as a potential preventive and/or early stage therapeutic agent for breast cancer.']",
