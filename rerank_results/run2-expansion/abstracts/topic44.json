We assessed BRAF gain and BRAF mutations in 123 low-grade diffuse gliomas, including 55 diffuse astrocytomas, 18 oligoastrocytomas and 50 oligodendrogliomas. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed BRAF gain in 17/50 (34%) oligodendrogliomas, a significantly higher frequency than in diffuse astrocytomas (7/55; 13%; P = 0.0112). BRAF gain was common in low-grade diffuse gliomas with 1p/19q loss (39%) and those lacking any of the genetic alterations analyzed (31%), but was rare in those with TP53 mutations (2%). Logistic regression analysis showed a significant positive association between 1p/19q loss and BRAF gain (P = 0.0032) and a significant negative association between TP53 mutations and BRAF gain (P = 0.0042). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of 26 low-grade diffuse gliomas with BRAF gain additionally revealed BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion in one oligodendroglioma. Sequencing of cDNA in 17 low-grade diffuse gliomas showed BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion in another oligodendroglioma. A BRAF(V600E) mutation was also detected in one oligodendroglioma, and a BRAF(A598V) in one diffuse astrocytoma. These results suggest that low-grade diffuse gliomas with 1p/19q loss have frequent BRAF gains, and a small fraction of oligodendrogliomas may show BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion.",

In addition, BRAF is mutated in the majority of low-grade gliomas and its expression and activity is significantly increased in the majority of high-grade gliomas. Although the importance of RTKs and RAS signaling in glioma development has been shown, the role of BRAF has yet to be characterized. We evaluated the effect of activated BRAF in glioma formation using the retroviral replication-competent avian leukosis virus long terminal repeat, splice acceptor (RCAS)/TVA system to transfer genes encoding activated forms of BRAF, KRas, Akt and Cre to nestin-expressing neural progenitor cells in Ink4a/Arf(lox/lox) mice in vivo. Although expression of activated BRAF alone is not sufficient for tumorigenesis, the combination of activated BRAF and Akt or BRAF with Ink4a/Arf loss is transforming. Interestingly, activated BRAF generates gliomas with characteristics similar to activated KRas in the context of Akt but not Ink4a/Arf loss.

BRAF mutations are most frequently detected in certain subtypes of low-grade glioma, such as pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA), ganglioglioma (GG) and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT). However, it is unclear whether gliomas harboring BRAF mutations can be invariably regarded as these glioma subtypes or their derivatives. To address this question, we analyzed 274 gliomas in our institutional case series. We performed high-resolution melting analyses and subsequent direct Sanger sequencing on DNA isolated from snap-frozen tumor tissues. As expected, BRAF mutations were detected in the aforementioned low-grade gliomas: in 4/27 PAs, 2/3 PXAs, 4/8 GGs, and 1/6 DNTs. In addition to these gliomas, 1/2 astroblastomas (ABs) and 2/122 glioblastomas (GBs) harbored BRAF mutations. Pathological investigation of the two GBs revealed that one was a GB displaying epithelial features that presumably arose from a precedent GG, whereas the other GB, which harbored a rare G596Â A mutation, showed marked epithelial features, including astroblastic rosettes. Our results indicate that in addition to being present in established BRAF-associated gliomas, BRAF mutations might be associated with epithelial features in high-grade gliomas, including sheet-like arrangement of polygonal tumor cells with a plump cytoplasm and astroblastic rosettes, and thus could potentially serve as a genetic marker for these features.",

Recurrent or progressive tumors, analyzed in four patients, had the same molecular genotype as their primary. Increased BRAF copy number and activating BRAF mutations may be involved in the development of low-grade glioma via overactivation of the Ras/Raf pathway.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to identify the antiproliferative effect of the new oncogenic B-Raf targeting drug UAI-201 on 6 types of glioma cell lines with differing B-Raf mutational status.;The IC50 values of UAI-201 were determined using crystal violet assays in six glioma cell lines. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to assess the functional role of multidrug resistance proteins in response to UAI-201. The effects of UAI-201 on six glioma cells were further examined by immunoblotting analysis, cell cycle analysis, flow cytometric apoptotic assay and autophagy assay. To identify the role of autophagy in UAI-201-induced growth inhibition, Atg5 and Beclin 1 were knocked down by RNA interference.;Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed a poor correlation between UAI-201 activity and the expression level of multidrug resistance proteins. The growth inhibitory effects of UAI-201 correlated with the BRAF-V600E genotype of the glioma cell lines. BRAF blockade with UAI-201 resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of MEK/ERK phosphorylations and increased G0/G1 arrest in glioma cells with BRAF-V600E. Interestingly, UAI-201 preferentially induced autophagy in BRAF-V600E cells, but not in BRAF-WT cells. More notably, autophagy inhibition through siRNA-mediated Beclin 1 knockdown partially attenuated the growth inhibition induced by UAI-201 in BRAF-V600E cells.;The pro-death autophagic processes could be one of the underlying mechanisms for the sensitization of BRAF-V600E glioma cells toward UAI-201.",

This oncogenic mutation is also detected in ~5Â % of other pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs) including pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) and diffuse astrocytomas. In the current multi-institutional study of 56 non-PXA/non-GG diencephalic pediatric LGGs, the BRAF (V600) mutation rate is 36Â %. V600-mutant tumors demonstrate a predilection for infants and young children (<age 3) and have a higher tendency for multicentricity. On neuroimaging, BRAF (V600)-mutant tumors appear as nodular, yet infiltrative contrast-enhancing masses. Morphologic examination reveals a monophasic, predominantly compact and partially infiltrative architecture. Due to the lack of classic morphologic features associated with PAs, pilomyxoid astrocytomas (PMAs), or diffuse astrocytomas, 75Â % of the BRAF (V600)-mutant tumors could not be definitively classified on initial histopathologic evaluation. At a median follow-up of 55Â months, the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate for BRAF (V600)-mutant diencephalic low-grade astrocytomas (LGAs) was 22Â Â±Â 12Â %, shorter than BRAF (V600)-WT PAs (52Â Â±Â 13Â %) but higher than PMAs (10Â Â±Â 6Â %). Of note, long-term PFS was observed in several adolescent patients with BRAF (V600)-mutant tumors. In children aged 0-12Â years, 5-year PFS rate and median PFS in BRAF (V600)-mutant LGAs are 9Â Â±Â 9Â % and 19Â months (95Â % CI 3-37Â months), respectively. The PFS is comparable to that in BRAF (V600)-WT PMAs (5-year PFS rate: 10Â Â±Â 9Â %; median PFS: 15Â months, 95Â % CI 3-32Â months; pÂ =Â 0.96) and significantly shorter than BRAF (V600)-WT PAs (5-year PFS rate: 46Â Â±Â 13Â %; median PFS: 51Â months, 95Â % CI 20-â months; pÂ <Â 0.05). In summary, diencephalic BRAF (V600)-mutant pediatric LGAs are associated with unique clinicopathologic features and have a more aggressive clinical course, especially in children under age 13.

At relapse, high grade gliomas, such as glioblastoma multiforme, are refractory to therapy and universally fatal. BRAF V600E-mutations have been described in a modest 6% to 7% of primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors, but with increased prevalence in the pediatric population and in certain brain tumor subtypes. The use of BRAF inhibitors have transformed melanoma therapy however their use in brain tumors remains unproven.;We describe the pediatric case of a now 12 year old Caucasian male who originally presented at age 9 with a right fronto-parietal glioblastoma multiforme that recurred 2 Â½âyears from diagnosis. Molecular analysis of the primary tumor revealed a BRAF V600E mutation and the patient was placed on the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. A complete response was observed after 4 months of therapy and remains sustained at 6 months.;This is the first report of a complete response of relapsed glioblastoma multiforme to targeted BRAF inhibitor therapy. While not a predominant mutation in glioblastoma multiforme, the increased prevalence of BRAF V600 mutations in pediatric CNS tumors and certain subtypes marks a population to whom this therapy could be applied. Response to this therapy suggests that BRAF inhibitors can affect primary CNS lesions when a documented and targetable mutation is present.",

Polymerase chain reaction testing identified KIAA1549:BRAF fusions in 51 (48%) tumors overall, including 42 (60%) pilocytic astrocytomas, 4 (17%) unclassifiable low-grade gliomas, 4 (36%) low-grade glioneuronal/neuroepithelial tumors, 0 (of 5) pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, 0 (of 4) diffuse astrocytomas (World Health Organization grade II), and 1 (of 3, 33%) pilomyxoid astrocytoma. KIAA1549:BRAF gene fusions confirmed by sequencing included the previously reported ones involving exons 1-16/9-18 (49%), 1-15/9-18 (35%), and 1-16/11-18 (8%) and 2 fusions with novel breakpoints: 1-15/11-18 (6%) and 1-17/10-18 (1%).

KIAA1549:BRAF fusions were significantly more frequent in infratentorial (57%) and optic pathway (59%) tumors versus supratentorial (19%) tumors (p = 0.001). We did not identify significantly improved progression-free survival in tumors with fusions. In summary, KIAA1549:BRAF fusions predominate in pilocytic astrocytomas but are also present in some low-grade unclassifiable gliomas and glioneuronal tumors. The prognostic and therapeutic significance of this alteration is unclear and merits further study.",

Despite the lack of a complete understanding of the biology of these tumors, significant advances have been made in the past decades. One of the key discoveries made in the area of malignant gliomas is that these tumors can be induced and maintained by aberrant signaling networks. In this context, the Ras pathway has been extensively exploited, from both basic and translational perspectives. Although somatic oncogenic mutations of Ras genes are frequent in several cancer types, early investigations on gliomas revealed disappointing facts that the Ras mutations are nearly absent in malignant gliomas and that the BRAF mutations are present in a very small percentage of gliomas. Therefore, the observed deregulation of the Ras-RAF-ERK signaling pathway in gliomas is attributed to its upstream positive regulators, including, EGFR and PDGFR known to be highly active in the majority of malignant gliomas. In contrast to the initial negative results on the somatic mutations of H-Ras, K-Ras and BRAF, recent breakthrough studies on pediatric low-grade astrocytomas uncovered genetic alterations of the BRAF gene involving copy number gains and rearrangements. The 7q34 rearrangements result in a novel in-frame KIAA1549:BRAF fusion gene that possesses constitutive BRAF kinase activity resembling oncogenic BRAF (V600E). In light of the earlier findings and recent breakthroughs, this review summarizes our current understanding of the Ras-RAF-ERK signaling pathway in gliomas and the outcome of preclinical and clinical studies that evaluated the efficacy of Ras-targeted therapy in malignant gliomas.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Brain tumors are the most common solid pediatric malignancy. For high-grade, recurrent, or refractory pediatric brain tumors, radiation therapy (XRT) is an integral treatment modality. In the era of personalized cancer therapy, molecularly targeted agents have been designed to inhibit pathways critical to tumorigenesis. Our evolving knowledge of genetic aberrations in pediatric gliomas is being exploited with the use of specific targeted inhibitors. These agents are additionally being combined with XRT to increase the efficacy and duration of local control. In this review, we discuss novel agents targeting three different pathways in gliomas, and their potential combination with XRT. BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase in the RAS/RAF/MAPK kinase pathway, which is integral to cellular division, survival, and metabolism. Two-thirds of pilocytic astrocytomas, a low-grade pediatric glioma, contain a translocation within the BRAF gene called KIAA1549:BRAF that causes an overactivation of the MEK/MAPK signaling cascade. In vitro and in vivo data support the use of MEK or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in low-grade gliomas expressing this translocation. Additionally, 15-20% of high-grade pediatric gliomas express BRAF V600E, an activating mutation of the BRAF gene. Pre-clinical in vivo and in vitro data in BRAF V600E gliomas demonstrate dramatic cooperation between XRT and small molecule inhibitors of BRAF V600E. Another major signaling cascade that plays a role in pediatric glioma pathogenesis is the PI3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR pathway, known to be upregulated in the majority of high- and low-grade pediatric gliomas. Dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are in clinical trials for adult high-grade gliomas and are poised to enter studies of pediatric tumors. Finally, many brain tumors express potent stimulators of angiogenesis that render them refractory to treatment. An analog of thalidomide, CC-5103 increases the secretion of critical cytokines of the tumor microenvironment, including IL-2, IFN-Î³, TNF-Î±, and IL-10, and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of recurrent or refractory pediatric central nervous system tumors. In summary, several targeted inhibitors with radiation are currently under investigation in both translational bench research and early clinical trials. This review article summarizes the molecular rationale for, and the pre-clinical data supporting the combinations of these targeted agents with other anti-cancer agents and XRT in pediatric gliomas. In many cases, parallels are drawn to molecular mechanisms and targeted inhibitors of adult gliomas. We additionally discuss the potential mechanisms underlying the efficacy of these agents.",

BRAF mutation is seen in melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (including papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from ovarian teratoma), ovarian serous tumours, colorectal carcinoma, gliomas, hepatobiliary carcinomas and hairy cell leukaemia. In these cancers, various genetic aberrations of the BRAF proto-oncogene, such as different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, have been reported. The most common mutation, BRAF V600E, can be detected by DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumour tissue. Detection of BRAF V600E mutation has the potential for clinical use as a diagnostic and prognostic marker. In addition, a great deal of research effort has been spent in strategies inhibiting its activity. Indeed, recent clinical trials involving BRAF selective inhibitors exhibited promising response rates in metastatic melanoma patients. Clinical trials are underway for other cancers. However, cutaneous side effects of treatment have been reported and therapeutic response to cancer is short-lived due to the emergence of several resistance mechanisms. In this review, we give an update on the clinical pathological relevance of BRAF mutation in cancer. It is hoped that the review will enhance the direction of future research and assist in more effective use of the knowledge of BRAF mutation in clinical practice.",

An institutional cohort of 147 PAs (118 with outcome data) from both cerebellar and non-cerebellar locations (spine, diencephalon, midbrain, brainstem, and cortex) was utilized in this study. Parameters included quantification of characteristic morphologic variables as well as genes and molecular loci previously shown to be of relevance in high-grade gliomas, including 1p, 9p, 10q, 17p, 19q, and BRAF. Neither 1p, 9p, and 10q nor 19q showed significant association with outcome in PAs, although p16 deletion was more common in PAs of the midbrain, brainstem, and spinal cord. Loss of heterozygosity on 17p13 correlated with increased risk of recurrence in cerebellar tumors. BRAF gene rearrangements were more common in cerebellar tumors than non-cerebellar tumors and associated with classic biphasic histology in the cerebellum. However, clinical outcome was independent of BRAF status. The molecular biology of PAs differs according to location, yet BRAF rearrangements do not appear to produce PAs with different behavior. Nevertheless, such tumors may have altered sensitivity to pathway-specific adjuvant therapy. Additionally, deletion on 17p13 may be an adverse prognostic biomarker in cerebellar tumors.",

Pediatric GBMs have a distinctive molecular pathogenesis, as H3F3A and DAXX mutations are frequent, and their gene expression profile is different than adult GBMs. Other lower-grade gliomas of childhood, such as pilocytic astrocytoma and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, are characterized by BRAF mutations or activating gene rearrangements involving BRAF.

Understanding the genetic alterations that drive glioma formation and progression may help improve patient prognosis by identification of novel treatment targets. Recently, two major studies have performed in-depth mutation analysis of glioblastomas (the most common and aggressive subtype of glioma). This systematic approach revealed three major pathways that are affected in glioblastomas: The receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, the TP53 pathway and the pRB pathway. Apart from frequent mutations in the IDH1/2 gene, much less is known about the causal genetic changes of grade II and III (anaplastic) gliomas. Exceptions include TP53 mutations and fusion genes involving the BRAF gene in astrocytic and pilocytic glioma subtypes, respectively. In this review, we provide an update on all common events involved in the initiation and/or progression across the different subtypes of glioma and provide future directions for research into the genetic changes.

Sporadic cases are associated with KIAA1549:BRAF fusion rearrangements, while 15-20% of children develop PA in the context of the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) inherited tumor predisposition syndrome. The unique predilection of these tumors to form within the optic pathway and brainstem (NF1-PA) and cerebellum (sporadic PA) raises the possibility that gliomagenesis requires more than biallelic inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene or expression of the KIAA1549:BRAF transcript. Several etiologic explanations include differential susceptibilities of preneoplastic neuroglial cell types in different brain regions to these glioma-causing genetic changes, contributions from non-neoplastic cells and signals in the tumor microenvironment, and genomic modifiers that confer glioma risk. As clinically-faithful rodent models of sporadic PA are currently under development, Nf1 genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) models have served as tractable systems to study the role of the cell of origin, deregulated intracellular signaling, non-neoplastic cells in the tumor microenvironment and genomic modifiers in gliomagenesis. In this report, we highlight advances in Nf1-GEM modeling and review new experimental evidence that supports the emerging concept that Nf1- and KIAA1549:BRAF-induced gliomas arise from specific cell types in particular brain locations.

The point mutation of the BRAF gene at codon 600 (BRAF V600E) is found in several tumor entities and can be approached with selective inhibitory antibodies. The BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma brain metastases and in other cancer diseases. Therefore the BRAF V600E mutation is a highly interesting oncological target in brain tumors.;This study assesses the BRAF V600E mutation status in 969 intracranial neoplasms using a tissue microarray method and immunohistochemical staining with the mutation-specific VE-1 antibody, followed by sequencing of positively stained cases.;Out of 784 primary brain tumors seven cases with a BRAF V600E mutation were detected (7/784, 1Â %). Six of these cases were neuroepithelial tumors (6/667, 1Â %) encompassing 2 astrocytomas WHO grade II (2/42, 5Â %), 1 gliosarcoma WHO grade IV (1/75, 1Â %) and 3 glioblastomas WHO grade IV (3/312, 1Â %). Interestingly, all three mutant glioblastomas showed epithelioid histopathological features. Patients with V600E mutated astrocytic tumors were significantly younger (mean age 15.3Â years) than wildtype cases (58.2Â years). Among three rhabdoid meningiomas, one case was mutated (1/3) while all other grade I-III meningiomas (1/116, 1Â %) and all fifty vestibular schwannomas analyzed were of wildtype status. The vast majority of the BRAF V600E mutations were found in cerebral metastases of malignant melanomas and carcinomas (29/135, 22Â %), with false-positive staining found in four breast cancer cases and two non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) samples.;Our data suggest routine screening for BRAF V600E mutations for glioblastomas WHO grade IV below the age of 30, especially in glioblastomas with epithelioid features and in all rhabdoid meningiomas WHO grade III. For colorectal carcinoma, thyroid cancer, malignant melanoma and gliomas BRAF V600E immunostaining is sufficient for screening purposes. We also recommend routine immunohistochemical staining followed by sequencing validation in rare CNS metastases or metastases of unknown primary. Immunohistochemical analysis using mutation-specific antibodies on tissue microarrays is a feasible, time- and cost-efficient approach to high-throughput screening for specific mutations in large tumor series but sequencing validation is necessary in unexpected cases.",

There have been many advances over the last two decades as we widen our search for a molecular basis of gliomagenesis. Many biomarkers have been discovered to be important in the management of gliomas, including 1p19q co-deletion, MGMT promoter methylation, BRAF and IDH1 mutations. In this review, we attempt to summarise the available literature on these biomarkers and their use in the diagnosis and management of gliomas. We pay special attention to the recently discovered IDH1 mutation, which is already proving to be a valuable new marker for favourable prognosis and may also indicate a greater response to therapy. 1p19q co-deletions have been shown to delineate a clinically distinct tumour type and are now routinely tested for in certain situations and can help direct treatment. MGMT promoter methylation is one of the most commonly studied biomarkers in gliomas. It has been shown to be a strong positive prognostic marker in gliomas, with positive tumours being more sensitive to chemotherapy. However, a lack of alternatives means that it is not yet a routine mutation tested for clinically. BRAF mutations are new markers found in pilocytic astrocytomas. Although the prognostic value of such mutations is not yet known, they may play a significant role in the diagnosis and treatment of such tumours. IDH1 mutations are 'the new kid on the block' and seem to play a central role in the pathogenesis of gliomas. They represent an independent and favourable prognostic marker and are a new molecular marker for disease diagnosis. Its role in determining response to chemotherapy is still controversial but with further study, IDH1 mutations may prove to be an invaluable marker in the management of gliomas.",

In melanoma a correlation has been suggested between the occurrence of TERT promoter mutations and v-RAF murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) mutations. We investigated TERT promoter and BRAF mutation frequency in respectively 94 and 86 consecutive MPNST cases from our institute. TERT promoter mutation analysis on DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens was performed by SNaPshot analysis. Sequence analysis of BRAF was performed by bidirectional DNA sequencing. We identified TERT C228T or C250T promoter mutations in 10 % (9/94) and BRAF V600E mutations in 3 % (3/86) of MPNSTs. All TERT promoter- and BRAF mutations occurred in NF1 unrelated tumors. One co-occurrence of a TERT promoter- and a BRAF mutation was observed. In comparison with other neuroectodermal derived malignant neoplasms, TERT promoter mutations occur at relatively low frequency in MPNSTs.

However, optimal incorporation of molecular markers into clinical care is still controversial. Here, the potential utility of genetic alterations found in gliomas in refining histological diagnosis, prognosis, and predictive values for treatment selection is reviewed. Among all, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, 1p/19q codeletion, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations have been identified as favorable prognostic markers. MGMT promoter methylation is the only potential predictive marker for response to temozolomide and alkylating agents in glioblastoma (GBM), but it is not of assistance in diagnostics. IDH1 mutations and 1p/19q codeletion are also useful for classifying and grading gliomas, since 1p/19q codeletion is tightly linked to oligodendroglial lineage, and IDH1 mutations are restricted to grade II/III gliomas, while not to primary GBM. BRAF fusion is a good marker for pilocytic astrocytoma. High-throughput profiling techniques for gene expression and epigenetic modification have provided new subtype classifications for GBM as well as lower grade gliomas, which may be of prognostic and predictive values.

Furthermore, the levels of phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK), a downstream effector of RAS, are also increased. In mice, activated KRas cooperates with the loss of INK4a-ARF locus or with activated Akt to induce gliomas, confirming an important role for this pathway in glioma biology. However, to correctly target therapies against the RAS signaling pathway, it is necessary to identify the effectors that contribute to RAS-mediated gliomagenesis. In this study, we investigated the contribution of RAF signaling in glioma oncogenesis. We find that the levels of RAF-1 and BRAF proteins and RAF kinase activity are increased in human GBM samples. We confirm the importance of this finding by demonstrating a causal role for a constitutively active Raf-1 mutant in glioma formation in mice. Specifically, we find that activated Raf-1 cooperates with Arf loss or Akt activation to generate gliomas similar to activated KRas under the same conditions. Our study suggests that the oncogenic effect of KRas in glioma formation may be transduced at least in part through Raf signaling and that therapeutic targeting of this pathway may be beneficial in glioma treatment.",

SNP array analysis of case 2, a possible dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNT), revealed a 2.6âMb deletion, which included the 5' end of BRAF and extended to the 3' end of FAM131B. In case 3, deletions involving BRAF and FAM131B were observed in both a primary and a recurrent PA. RNA-based sequence analysis of cases 2 and 3 confirmed a fusion between FAM131B exon 2 and BRAF exon 9. The presence of fusion transcripts in these three LGGs highlights the utility of SNP array analysis to identify deletions that are suggestive of fusion proteins. BRAF fusions can result from multiple non-overlapping deletions, suggesting various complex mechanisms of formation. ",

Thus, we performed a systematic review to summarise biomarkers that are associated with seizures in glioma patients.

A totall of 26 eligible studies with 2224 cases were included in this systematic review of publications to 20 June, 2016. Genetic biomarkers such as isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations, low expression of excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2), high xCT expression, overexpression of adenosine kinase (ADK) and low expression of very large G-protein-coupled receptor-1 (VLGR1) are primarily involved in synaptic transmission, whereas BRAF mutations, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification, miR-196b expression and low ki-67 expression are associated with regulation of cell proliferation. However, there is limited evidence regarding the roles of RAD50 interactor 1 (RINT1) and olig2 in epileptogenesis among glioma patients.

A four-tiered WHO grading scheme has been successfully applied to a spectrum of diffusely infiltrative astrocytomas, but it is not fully applicable to other gliomas, including oligodendrogliomas and ependymomas. Recent genetic studies have revealed that the major categories of gliomas, such as circumscribe astrocytomas, infiltrating astrocytomas/oligodendrogliomas, and glioblastoma, roughly correspond to major genetic alterations, including isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) 1/2 mutations, TP53 mutations, co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p/19q, and BRAF mutation/fusion. These genetic alterations are clinically significant in terms of the response to treatment(s) and/or the prognosis. It is, thus, rational that future classification of gliomas should be based on genotypes, rather than phenotypes, although the genetic features of each tumor are not sufficiently understood at present to draw a complete map of the gliomas, and genetic testing is not yet available worldwide, particularly in Asian and African countries. This review summarizes the current concepts of the WHO classification, as well as the current understanding of the major genetic alterations in glioma and the potential use of these alterations as diagnostic criteria.",

Initially described in melanoma, colon and papillary thyroid carcinoma, these alterations have also been observed in primary nervous system tumors albeit at a low frequency. We analyzed exon 15 of BRAF spanning the V600 locus by direct sequencing in 1,320 adult and pediatric tumors of the nervous system including various types of glial, embryonal, neuronal and glioneuronal, meningeal, adenohypophyseal/sellar, and peripheral nervous system tumors. A total of 96 BRAF mutations were detected; 93 of the V600E type and 3 cases with a three base pair insertion between codons 599 and 600. The highest frequencies of BRAF (V600E) mutations were found in WHO grade II pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (42/64; 66%) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas with anaplasia (15/23; 65%), as well as WHO grade I gangliogliomas (14/77; 18%), WHO grade III anaplastic gangliogliomas (3/6) and pilocytic astrocytomas (9/97; 9%). In pilocytic astrocytomas BRAF (V600E) mutation was strongly associated with extra-cerebellar location (pÂ =Â 0.009) and was most frequent in diencephalic tumors (4/12; 33%). Glioblastomas and other gliomas were characterized by a low frequency or absence of mutations. No mutations were detected in non-glial tumors, including embryonal tumors, meningiomas, nerve sheath tumors and pituitary adenomas. The high mutation frequencies in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, gangliogliomas and extra-cerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas implicate BRAF (V600E) mutation as a valuable diagnostic marker for these rare tumor entities.

While the genetic profiles of common LGNTs, such as the pilocytic astrocytoma and 'adult-type' diffuse gliomas, are largely established, those of uncommon LGNTs remain to be defined. In this study, we have used massively parallel sequencing and various targeted molecular genetic approaches to study alterations in 91 LGNTs, mostly from children but including young adult patients. These tumors comprise dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNETs; nÂ =Â 22), diffuse oligodendroglial tumors (d-OTs; nÂ =Â 20), diffuse astrocytomas (DAs; nÂ =Â 17), angiocentric gliomas (nÂ =Â 15), and gangliogliomas (nÂ =Â 17). Most LGNTs (84Â %) analyzed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) were characterized by a single driver genetic alteration. Alterations of FGFR1 occurred frequently in LGNTs composed of oligodendrocyte-like cells, being present in 82Â % of DNETs and 40Â % of d-OTs. In contrast, a MYB-QKI fusion characterized almost all angiocentric gliomas (87Â %), and MYB fusion genes were the most common genetic alteration in DAs (41Â %). A BRAF:p.V600E mutation was present in 35Â % of gangliogliomas and 18Â % of DAs. Pathogenic alterations in FGFR1/2/3, BRAF, or MYB/MYBL1 occurred in 78Â % of the series. Adult-type d-OTs with an IDH1/2 mutation occurred in four adolescents, the youngest aged 15Â years at biopsy. Despite a detailed analysis, novel genetic alterations were limited to two fusion genes, EWSR1-PATZ1 and SLMAP-NTRK2, both in gangliogliomas. Alterations in BRAF, FGFR1, or MYB account for most pathogenic alterations in LGNTs, including pilocytic astrocytomas, and alignment of these genetic alterations and cytologic features across LGNTs has diagnostic implications. Additionally, therapeutic options based upon targeting the effects of these alterations are already in clinical trials. ",

Recent efforts at comprehensive genetic characterization of various primary brain tumor types have identified a number of common alterations and pathways common to multiple tumor types. Common pathways in glioma biology include growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases and their downstream signaling via the MAP kinase cascade or PI3K signaling, loss of apoptosis through p53, cell cycle regulation, angiogenesis via VEGF signaling, and invasion. However, in addition to these common general pathway alterations, a number of specific alterations have been identified in particular tumor types, and a number of these have direct therapeutic implications. These include mutations or fusions in the BRAF gene seen in pilocytic astrocytomas (and gangliogliomas). In oligodendrogliomas, mutations in IDH1 and codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q are associated with improved survival with upfront use of combined chemotherapy and radiation, and these tumors also have unique mutations of CIC and FUBP1 genes. Low grade gliomas are increasingly seen to be divided into two groups based on IDH mutation status, with astrocytomas developing through IDH mutation followed by p53 mutation, while poor prognosis low grade gliomas and primary glioblastomas (GBMs) are characterized by EGFR amplification, loss of PTEN, and loss of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. GBMs can be further characterized based on gene expression and gene methylation patterns into three or four distinct subgroups. Prognostic markers in diffuse gliomas include IDH mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and MGMT methylation, and MGMT is also a predictive marker in elderly patients with glioblastoma treated with temozolomide monotherapy.

Clonogenic survival assays were carried out in pediatric and adult HGG cell lines (n = 6) to assess radiosensitizing effects of MK-1775. DNA repair capacity was evaluated by measuring protein levels of Î³-H2AX, a marker of double strand DNA breaks.

This can be particularly challenging with small biopsies that often yield limited amounts of tissue for pathologic study, especially considering the marked differences in prognosis and therapy after a pathologic diagnosis. This paper will review some basic principles of gliosis as an astrocytic reaction to a wide range of central nervous system insults and focus on some common diagnostic pitfalls such as (1) gliosis associated with brain tumor mimics, including demyelinating disease and infections, (2) gliosis associated with nonglial tumors such as craniopharyngioma, hemangioblastoma, metastases, and central nervous system lymphoma. New diagnostic methods have facilitated the differentiation between reactive astrocytosis and the diffuse gliomas. Of these, the use of mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH-1) as a marker of diffuse infiltrating astroctomas, oligodendrogliomas, and a subset of glioblastomas (secondary glioblastomas) is particularly exciting for tissue diagnosis and patient prognosis. In addition IDH-1 may be useful to distinguish a diffuse infiltrating glioma from low-grade \"focal\" neoplasms such as the pilocytic astocytoma in histologically ambiguous cases. The discovery of BRAF mutations as molecular signatures of some pilocytic astrocytomas, gangliogliomas, and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas has provided another diagnostic tool for the pathologist. Only after a definitive diagnosis of a diffuse infiltrating glioma or a focal glioma is made should a tumor grade be applied and some practical issues in current glioma grading are provided.",

In recent years molecular studies have identified a number of genetic and epigenetic markers that could contribute to an improved tumor classification and better prediction of response to therapy and prognosis in the individual patient. The most important molecular tests with differential diagnostic relevance in patients with astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors include the detection of genetic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), IDH2, alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX), histone H3.3 (H3F3A) and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) genes as well as the demonstration of codeletions of chromosomal arms 1p and 19q. Important predictive markers that have been linked to the response to alkylating chemotherapy are O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation in glioblastoma patients and 1p/19q codel status in anaplastic glioma patients. Oncogenic c11orf95/RELA fusion gene formation is characteristic for a subgroup of patients with supratentorial ependymoma. In addition to diagnostic testing of individual genes, novel microarray and next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques show promising perspectives in glioma diagnostics. The assessment of DNA methylation profiles using DNA methylation arrays representing 450,000 CpG dinucleotides distributed throughout the human genome (450Â k array test) now allows the robust molecular classification of gliomas into clinically relevant entities and variants. Moreover, glioma-associated gene panel NGS promises the timely parallel sequencing of relevant diagnostic and predictive marker genes in a single test. It will now be a major task to integrate these novel results and techniques into the conventional histological procedures in the up-coming revision of the WHO classification. ",

The molecular biology of adult malignant glioma is now well described and targeted therapies against VEGFR are already playing a role in the management of glioblastoma. It is likely that high grade gliomas in children and adults share common aberrant molecular pathways but the frequency and mechanisms involved probably will exhibit key differences and on-going comprehensive molecular analyses of paediatric high grade glioma are essential to determine which targets are important in children. However, selection for specific targeted therapy is unlikely to be based on, or restricted by, age but will require individual case by case testing for target presence in order to direct and maximise the efficacy of molecular therapy. Brainstem glioma remains a tumour with a dismal prognosis but relatively little is known about the underlying biology and progress will require a concerted effort to collect tissue by biopsy and autopsy to allow appropriate analysis to identify and validate targets. A new era of molecular based therapies offers the promise of major benefits in the management of paediatric glioma but translating this promise into reality will require further understanding of the biology driving these tumours.",

We performed high-resolution copy-number analysis on 44 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded diffuse PLGGs to identify recurrent alterations. Diffuse PLGGs exhibited fewer such alterations than adult low-grade gliomas, but we identified several significantly recurrent events. The most significant event, 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs and resulted in partial duplication of the transcription factor MYBL1 with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas in the related gene v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) on 6q23.3. Whole-genome sequencing of a MYBL1-rearranged diffuse astrocytoma grade II demonstrated MYBL1 tandem duplication and few other events. Truncated MYBL1 transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice.

Pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve is an equally indolent subtype that is occasionally associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. In earlier studies, this subtype was considered within the larger category of 'optic pathway glioma,' which included infiltrating astrocytomas and other hypothalamic tumors. However, there have been suggestions that gliomas in the optic nerve, and especially pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve, are biologically different from tumors within the hypothalamus and other parts of the optic tract. Furthermore, the recent discovery of BRAF duplication and fusion with the KIAA1549 gene is reported to be more typical for posterior fossa tumors, and the rate of this aberration is not well known in pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve. To determine the distinction of pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve from pilocytic astrocytoma of the posterior fossa and to investigate the prevalence of BRAF aberrations, we reviewed the clinicopathological and molecular features of all such patients in our institution. Our study demonstrates that BRAF duplication is more frequent in posterior fossa tumors compared with pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve (P=0.011). However, the rates of phospho-MAPK1 and CDKN2A expression were high in both pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve and posterior fossa pilocytic astrocytoma, suggesting that the MAPK pathway is active in these tumors. Our study supports the notion that BRAF duplication is more typical of posterior fossa pilocytic astrocytoma and that molecular alterations other than KIAA1549 fusion may underlie MAPK pathway activation in pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve.

Here we confirm and extend the profile of molecular genetic findings in a MG-PNET involving the left frontal lobe of a 12-year-old male. Histologically, the PNET-like component showed morphological features akin to anaplastic medulloblastoma highlighted by widespread immunoreactivity for Î²III-tubulin (TUBB3) and nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein, and to a lesser degree, Neu-N, synaptophysin, and CD99, whereas the gliomatous component was demarcated by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) labeling. Immunohistochemical labeling with an anti-H3K27M mutant-specific antibody was not detectable in either gliomatous and/or PNET-like areas. Interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) study on touch preparations from frozen tumor and formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded histological sections showed amplification of MYC in both PNET-like and gliomatous areas. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray analysis revealed that the tumor carried gains of multiple chromosomes and chromosome arms, losses of multiple chromosomes and chromosome arms, gains of multiple chromosomal segments (not limited to amplification of chromosomal segments 4q12 including PDGFRA, and 8q24.21 including MYC), and a hitherto unreported chromothripsis-like abnormality on chromosome 8. No mutations were identified for IDH1, IDH2, or BRAF genes by sequence analysis. The molecular genetic findings support the presence of a CNS-PNET as an integral part of the tumor coupled with overlapping genetic alterations found in both adult and pediatric high-grade gliomas/glioblastoma.

These fusions were identified from analysis of focal copy number gains at 7q34, detected using Affymetrix 250K and 6.0 SNP arrays. PCR and sequencing confirmed the presence of five KIAA1549-BRAF fusion variants, along with a single fusion between SRGAP3 and RAF1. The resulting fusion genes lack the auto-inhibitory domains of BRAF and RAF1, which are replaced in-frame by the beginning of KIAA1549 and SRGAP3, respectively, conferring constitutive kinase activity. An activating mutation of KRAS was identified in the single pilocytic astrocytoma without a BRAF or RAF1 fusion. Further fusions and activating mutations in BRAF were identified in 28% of grade II astrocytomas, highlighting the importance of the ERK/MAP kinase pathway in the development of paediatric low-grade gliomas.",

TERT promoters C228T and C250T were mutually exclusive. Mutations were present in 18 of 80 PTCs (22.5%), in 40 of 78 (51%) advanced thyroid cancers (ATC + PDTC) (P = 3 Ã 10(-4) vs PTC), and in widely invasive HCCs (4 of 17), but not in minimally invasive HCCs (0 of 8). TERT promoter mutations were seen more frequently in advanced cancers with BRAF/RAS mutations compared to those that were BRAF/RAS wild-type (ATC + PDTC, 67.3 vs 24.1%; P < 10(-4)), whereas BRAF-mutant PTCs were less likely to have TERT promoter mutations than BRAF wild-type tumors (11.8 vs 50.0%; P = .04).;TERT promoter mutations are highly prevalent in advanced thyroid cancers, particularly those harboring BRAF or RAS mutations, whereas PTCs with BRAF or RAS mutations are most often TERT promoter wild type.

CIMP is associated with microsatellite instability but is also found in BRAF mutant microsatellite stable cancers that are associated with poor prognosis. The isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene causes CIMP in glioma due to an activating mutation that produces the 2-hydroxyglutarate oncometabolite. We therefore examined IDH1 alteration as a potential cause of CIMP in colorectal cancer. The IDH1 mutational hotspot was screened in 86 CIMP-positive and 80 CIMP-negative cancers. The entire coding sequence was examined in 81 CIMP-positive colorectal cancers. Forty-seven cancers varying by CIMP-status and IDH1 mutation status were examined using Illumina 450K DNA methylation microarrays. The R132C IDH1 mutation was detected in 4/166 cancers. All IDH1 mutations were in CIMP cancers that were BRAF mutant and microsatellite stable (4/45, 8.9%). Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis identified an IDH1 mutation-like methylation signature in approximately half of the CIMP-positive cancers. IDH1 mutation appears to cause CIMP in a small proportion of BRAF mutant, microsatellite stable colorectal cancers. This study provides a precedent that a single gene mutation may cause CIMP in colorectal cancer, and that this will be associated with a specific epigenetic signature and clinicopathological features.

Six patients with high grade spinal cord gliomas who presented to our institution between 1990 and 2015 were reviewed. Each patient underwent subtotal surgical resection, with a subset receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. Our primary outcomes of interest were pre-operative and post-operative functional status. One year survival rate was 100%. All patients had stable or improved American Spine Injury Association score immediately after surgery, which was maintained at 3months in 83.3% of patients. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) was stable at 3month follow up in 50% of patients, but all had decreased KPS 1year after surgery. A subset of patients received post-operative radiation and chemotherapy with 0% tumor recurrence rate at 3months. We assessed the molecular profiles of tumors from two patients in our series and found that each had mutations in TP53, but had wildtype BRAF, IDH-1, and MGMT. Taken together, our data show that patients with high grade spinal cord gliomas have an excellent survival at 1year, but with some decline in functional status within this period.

TERT mutations were also assessed, with PCR.;Material was available from 139 cases, in 6 of which results were uninformative. One hundred twenty-six tumors could be classified: 20 as type II (IDH mutation [mut], \"astrocytoma\"), 49 as type I (1p/19q codeletion, \"oligodendroglioma\"), 55 as type III (7+/10q- or TERTmut and 1p/19q intact, \"glioblastoma\"), and 2 as childhood glioblastoma (H3F3Amut), leaving 7 unclassified (total 91% classified). Molecular classification was of clear prognostic significance and correlated better with outcome than did classical histopathology. In 1p/19q codeleted tumors, outcome was not affected by CIC and FUBP1 mutations. MGMT promoter methylation remained the most predictive factor for survival benefit of PCV chemotherapy.;Targeted NGS allows a clinically relevant classification of diffuse glioma into groups with very different outcomes.

Their role has previously been described in colorectal cancer, as well as in gastric, breast, thyroid, prostate, ovarian, pancreatic, glioma, liver, leukemia and many other cancers. In a previous study, we have described protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type T, M, Z1 and Q genes (PTPRT, PTPRM, PTPRZ1 and PTPRQ) hypermethylated in sporadic colorectal cancer. Thus, in this study, we examined the relation of unbalanced chromosomal alterations within regions covering these four protein tyrosine phosphatase genes with this cancer. One hundred and two cancer tissues were molecularly characterized, including analysis of the BRAF and K-ras mutations and methylator phenotype. The analysis of chromosomal aberrations was performed using Comparative Genomic Hybridization. We observed amplification of three regions containing genes coding for PTPs, such as PTPRZ1 (7q31.3, amplified in 23.5% of cases), PTPRQ (12q21.2, amplified in 5.9% of cases), PTPRT (20q12, amplified in 29.4% of cases), along with deletions in the region of PTPRM (18p11.2, deleted in 21.6% of cases). These data may suggest that in sporadic colorectal cancer PTPRZ1, PTPRT, PTPRQ probably act as oncogenes, while PTPRM acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Our study also revealed that gains on chromosome 20q12 and losses on chromosome 18p11.2 are connected with the absence of the BRAF mutation and the conventional adenocarcinoma pathway. ",

A clinical diagnosis of NF1 was present in 28% of anaplastic PA.

Neither PDGFRA nor EGFR amplifications were present. pERK staining levels were similar among the three PA subsets, but a stepwise increase in cytoplasmic pAKT and to a lesser extent pS6 immunoreactivity was noted by immunohistochemistry in aggressive PA groups. This was particularly true in histologically anaplastic PA when compared with conventional PA (pÂ <Â 0.001 and pÂ =Â 0.005, respectively). In addition, PTEN expression at the mRNA level was decreased in histologically anaplastic PA when compared to the other groups (pÂ =Â 0.05).

Although most DNTs occur in the cerebral cortex, DNT-like tumors with unusual intraventricular or periventricular localizations have been reported. Most of them involve the septum pellucidum and the foramen of Monro. In this study, we have described the neuroradiologic, histopathologic, and molecular features of 7 cases (4 female and 3 male; patient age range, 3 to 34 y; mean age, 16.7 y). The tumors, all localized near the supratentorial midline structures in proximity to the foramen of Monro and septum pellucidum, appeared in magnetic resonance imaging as well-delimited cystic lesions with cerebrospinal fluid-like signal on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, some of them with typical fluid-attenuated inversion recovery ring sign. Histologically, they shared features with classic cortical DNTs but did not display aspects of multinodularity. From a molecular point of view the cases investigated did not show KIAA1549-BRAF fusions or FGFR1 mutations, alterations otherwise observed in pilocytic astrocytomas, or MYB and MYBL1 alterations that have been identified in a large group of pediatric low-grade gliomas. Moreover, BRAF mutations, which so far represent the most common molecular alteration found in cortical DNTs, were absent in this group of rare periventricular tumors. ",

Ganglioglioma grade I is a rare, circumscribed, glioneuronal tumor of the central nervous system (CNS) that occurs most often in young patients, most frequently in the temporal lobe and presents with seizures (1). The neuronal component consists of ganglion cells, abnormally grouped and occasionally binucleated. The glial component consists of piloid or fibrillary astrocytic elements, or of pseudo-oligodendroglial elements. Mitoses are occasional and necrosis is absent. Eosinophilic granular bodies (EGB) and perivascular lymphocytes are associated (1). The glial component variably expresses GFAP and OLIG2 and the neuronal component variably expresses synaptophysin, chromogranin A and MAP2. The progenitor marker CD34 often shows an extravascular stellar immunostaining (1). Ki67 labelling index is usually less than 3% and p53 immunostaining is negative. The majority of gangliogliomas are benign grade I tumours, however 6% present as grade III anaplastic ganglioglioma or undergo malignant transformation. Markers to predict anaplastic transformation of grade I tumours are poorly defined (1). The most frequent genetic alterations in ganglioglioma are BRAF p.V600E mutation (40-60%), gain of chromosomes 7 (23%) and 5 (18%) (1-4). This article is protected by copyright.

A total of 43 PA, including 35 sporadic grade I PA, 4 neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1)-associated PA, and 4 PA with pilomyxoid features, as well as 5 nonneoplastic brain controls were examined. BRAF fusion status was assessed in most cases. RNA was examined using the Agilent Human miRNA Microarray V3 platform. Expression of miRNA subsets was validated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) with Taqman probes. Validation of predicted protein targets was performed on tissue microarrays with the use of immunohistochemistry. We identified a subset of miRNAs that were differentially expressed in pediatric PAs versus normal brain tissue: 13 miRNAs were underexpressed, and 20 miRNAs were overexpressed in tumors. Differences were validated by qRT-PCR in a subset, with mean fold change in tumor versus brain of -17 (miR-124), -15 (miR-129), and 19.8 (miR-21). Searching for predicted protein targets in Targetscan, we identified a number of known and putative oncogenes that were predicted targets of miRNA sets relatively underexpressed in PA.

The average age for eGBM was 30.9 (range 2-79) years, including five pediatric cases and a M : F ratio of 4.5. The ePXA patients had a M : F ratio of 4 and averaged 21.2 (range 10-38) years in age, including two pediatric cases. Six eGBMs and two ePXAs recurred (median recurrence interval of 12 and 3.3 months, respectively). All tumors were composed of solid sheets of loosely cohesive, \"melanoma-like\" cells with only limited infiltration. ePXAs showed lower grade foci with classic features of PXA. Both tumor types showed focal expression of epithelial and glial markers, retained INI1 and BRG1 expression, occasional CD34 positivity, and lack of mutant IDH1 (R132H) immunoreactivity. BRAF V600E mutation was present in four eGBMs and four ePXAs. ODZ3 deletion was detected in seven eGBMs and two ePXAs. EGFR amplification was absent. Methylome analysis showed that one ePXA and one eGBM clustered with PXAs, one eGBM clustered with low-grade gliomas, and two eGBMs clustered with pediatric-type glioblastomas. Common histologic, immunohistochemical, molecular and clinical features found in eGBM and ePXA suggest that they are closely related or the same entity.

        "Doc_abstract":"Neural cell fate specification is well understood in the embryonic cerebral cortex, where the proneural genes Neurog2 and Ascl1 are key cell fate determinants. What is less well understood is how cellular diversity is generated in brain tumors. Gliomas and glioneuronal tumors, which are often localized in the cerebrum, are both characterized by a neoplastic glial component, but glioneuronal tumors also have an intermixed neuronal component. A core abnormality in both tumor groups is overactive RAS/ERK signaling, a pro-proliferative signal whose contributions to cell differentiation in oncogenesis are largely unexplored. We found that RAS/ERK activation levels differ in two distinct human tumors associated with constitutively active BRAF. Pilocytic astrocytomas, which contain abnormal glial cells, have higher ERK activation levels than gangliogliomas, which contain abnormal neuronal and glial cells. Using in vivo gain of function and loss of function in the mouse embryonic neocortex, we found that RAS/ERK signals control a proneural genetic switch, inhibiting Neurog2 expression while inducing Ascl1, a competing lineage determinant. Furthermore, we found that RAS/ERK levels control Ascl1's fate specification properties in murine cortical progenitors--at higher RAS/ERK levels, Ascl1(+) progenitors are biased toward proliferative glial programs, initiating astrocytomas, while at moderate RAS/ERK levels, Ascl1 promotes GABAergic neuronal and less glial differentiation, generating glioneuronal tumors. Mechanistically, Ascl1 is phosphorylated by ERK, and ERK phosphoacceptor sites are necessary for Ascl1's GABAergic neuronal and gliogenic potential. RAS/ERK signaling thus acts as a rheostat to influence neural cell fate selection in both normal cortical development and gliomagenesis, controlling Neurog2-Ascl1 expression and Ascl1 function.",

        "Doc_abstract":"Pediatric glioblastoma (pedGBM) is amongst the most common malignant brain tumors of childhood and carries a dismal prognosis. In contrast to adult GBM, few molecular prognostic markers for the pediatric counterpart have been established. We, therefore, investigated the prognostic significance of genomic and epigenetic alterations through molecular analysis of 202 pedGBM (1-18 years) with comprehensive clinical annotation. Routinely prepared formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples were assessed for genome-wide DNA methylation profiles, with known candidate genes screened for alterations via direct sequencing or FISH. Unexpectedly, a subset of histologically diagnosed GBM (n = 40, 20 %) displayed methylation profiles similar to those of either low-grade gliomas or pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXA). These tumors showed a markedly better prognosis, with molecularly PXA-like tumors frequently harboring BRAF V600E mutations and 9p21 (CDKN2A) homozygous deletion. The remaining 162 tumors with pedGBM molecular signatures comprised four subgroups: H3.3 G34-mutant (15 %), H3.3/H3.1 K27-mutant (43 %), IDH1-mutant (6 %), and H3/IDH wild-type (wt) GBM (36 %). These subgroups were associated with specific cytogenetic aberrations, MGMT methylation patterns and clinical outcomes. Analysis of follow-up data identified a set of biomarkers feasible for use in risk stratification: pedGBM with any oncogene amplification and/or K27M mutation (n = 124) represents a particularly unfavorable group, with 3-year overall survival (OS) of 5 %, whereas tumors without these markers (n = 38) define a more favorable group (3-year OS ~70 %).Combined with the lower grade-like lesions, almost 40 % of pedGBM cases had distinct molecular features associated with a more favorable outcome. This refined prognostication method for pedGBM using a molecular risk algorithm may allow for improved therapeutic choices and better planning of clinical trial stratification for this otherwise devastating disease.",

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning BRAFi-based therapy is therefore an important issue. Here we identified a previously unsuspected mechanism of BRAFi resistance driven by elevated Hedgehog (Hh) pathway activation that is observed in a cohort of melanoma patients after vemurafenib treatment. Specifically, we demonstrate that melanoma cell lines, with acquired in vitro-induced vemurafenib resistance, show increased levels of glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 and 2 (GLI1/GLI2) compared with naÃ¯ve cells. We also observed these findings in clinical melanoma specimens. Moreover, the increased expression of the transcription factors GLI1/GLI2 was independent of canonical Hh signaling and was instead correlated with the noncanonical Hh pathway, involving TGFÎ²/SMAD (transforming growth factor-Î²/Sma- and Mad-related family) signaling. Knockdown of GLI1 and GLI2 restored sensitivity to vemurafenib-resistant cells, an effect associated with both growth arrest and senescence. Treatment of vemurafenib-resistant cells with the GLI1/GLI2 inhibitor Gant61 led to decreased invasion of the melanoma cells in a three-dimensional skin reconstruct model and was associated with a decrease in metalloproteinase (MMP2/MMP9) expression and microphthalmia transcription factor upregulation. Gant61 monotherapy did not alter the drug sensitivity of naÃ¯ve cells, but could reverse the resistance of melanoma cells chronically treated with vemurafenib. We further noted that alternating dosing schedules of Gant61 and vemurafenib prevented the onset of BRAFi resistance, suggesting that this could be a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention of therapeutic escape. Our results suggest that targeting the Hh pathway in BRAFi-resistant melanoma may represent a viable therapeutic strategy to restore vemurafenib sensitivity, reducing or even inhibiting the acquired chemoresistance in melanoma patients.Oncogene advance online publication, 17 October 2016; doi:10.1038/onc.2016.348.",
